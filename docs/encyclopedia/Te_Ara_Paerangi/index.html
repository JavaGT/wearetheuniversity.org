For example, <a href="/encyclopedia/Ngti_Whtua_rkei">Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei</a> Trust emphasizes partnership-based approaches that reflect iwi mana motuhake: &quot;All matters in those relationships should reflect partnership-based approaches or those informing best practice research with a Māori or Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei world view, with an expectation of iwi mana Motuhake.&quot;</p><p>Several submissions advocate for increased investment in research by, with, and for Māori. Te Pūtahi highlights the need to recognize diverse Māori knowledge-making communities: &quot;Recognising communities, marae, whānau, and hapū as knowledge-making and knowledge-using communities with knowledge needs and aspirations in their own right.&quot;</p><p>Taumata Aronui calls for a &quot;deep commitment&quot; to mātauranga Māori, including its active application and expression: &quot;A thorough investigation and active and ongoing application and expression of mātauranga Māori in the sector leading to the maturation of bicultural Aotearoa-New Zealand tertiary education providers (and the nation overall).&quot;</p><p>Many submissions, including Te Pūtahitanga, call for dedicated funding for Māori-led RSI initiatives and the development of Tiriti-based frameworks for funding and evaluation: &quot;Ringfence funding for an independent Māori RSI entity and appointment of a transitional national Māori body to oversee its establishment.&quot;</p><h3>National Research Priorities and Future Focus</h3><p>Submissions consistently highlight the need for clear national research priorities that address Aotearoa&#39;s current and future challenges.</p><p>The Royal Society Te Apārangi stresses the importance of government leadership in setting a clear vision and direction for RSI, aligning research priorities with societal goals: &quot;It follows that the process of working out and prioritising the RSI input into meeting these societal goals needs to start with governments, working on behalf of taxpayers and citizens, to set direction, vision and priorities.&quot;</p><p>Submissions also point to the importance of agility and adaptability in the RSI system to address emerging challenges: &quot;Whanaungatanga: A sustainable, resilient and cohesive system that adapts to new challenges and opportunities.&quot; (Te Ara Paerangi – Future Pathways White Paper)</p><p>The White Paper emphasizes the need to &quot;accelerate innovation, diversify and scale up impact,&quot; recognizing the limitations of the current system: &quot;The RSI system is not well-placed to absorb the increased funding that is necessary to prepare us for the future.&quot;</p><h3>Valuing People and Supporting Diverse Career Pathways</h3><p>Submissions recognize the critical role of the RSI workforce and the need to attract, develop, and retain talented people.</p><p>Several submissions highlight the need for stable and diverse career pathways within the RSI system, particularly for early career researchers. The White Paper acknowledges the pressures faced by the workforce: &quot;Our research workforce is under pressure, lacks diversity, and career paths are unstable.&quot;</p><p>Submissions advocate for improved support and conditions for doctoral students. For example, Yee, Patel, and Baisden discuss the precarious position of PhD students: &quot;A PhD student on a doctoral stipend faces a strange position in which they are treated both as an employee and as a student.&quot;</p><p>The White Paper emphasizes the need to support diversity at all levels, including specific policy directions for empowering Pacific Peoples: &quot;Invest in research, science and innovation by and for Pacific Peoples in New Zealand and across the Pacific.&quot;</p><h3>Investment and Infrastructure</h3><p>Submissions underscore the need for increased and diversified investment in RSI, along with strategic investment in infrastructure to support future research needs.</p><p>Submissions advocate for a greater focus on mission-led research and innovation. Te Pūtahitanga calls for a shift from an extractive to a generative approach, particularly in relation to Māori: &quot;Sector reform should shift the current system from one that is largely extractive and deficit-focused (when it comes to Māori) to one that is generative and strengths-based.&quot;</p><p>Submissions also call for improved coordination and strategic decision-making for large property and capital investments: &quot;Significant investment must be made in appropriate property and capital investments that are fit for purpose for a Tiriti-engabled RSI system.&quot; (Te Pūtahitanga)</p><p>The Royal Society Te Apārangi highlights the importance of maintaining critical research infrastructure, such as databases and collections, for long-term research and societal benefit: &quot;These databases provide immense value across science and society, including biosecurity, food production, trade, medicine and public health, conservation, ecology and environmental science.&quot;</p><p>This briefing document provides a high-level overview of key themes. Further detailed analysis of individual submissions and the White Paper is recommended to gain a comprehensive understanding of the proposed reforms and their potential impact on Aotearoa New Zealand&#39;s RSI system.</p><h3>Funding Mechanisms to Address Precarity and Promote Diversity</h3><p>The submissions to &quot;Te Ara Paerangi - Future Pathways&quot; offer various suggestions on how research funding mechanisms can be redesigned to better address precarity and promote diversity in the research workforce. Here are some key recommendations:</p><ul><li>Base Grant Funding<ul><li>A significant number of submissions strongly advocate for a base grant funding model to provide more stability and predictability for research organisations. This would shift away from the current reliance on short-term, competitive funding, which contributes to precarity and uncertainty for researchers.</li></ul></li><li>The sources suggest that base grants could cover a portion of researcher salaries or core operating costs, allowing institutions to offer more permanent positions and invest in workforce development.<ul><li>However, there are differing opinions on the optimal design and implementation of base grants. Some submissions, such as the one from Te Pūtahitanga, recommend that base grant funding be allocated directly to researchers or research groups rather than the institution as a whole. This approach is viewed as a way to empower researchers, particularly those from underrepresented groups, and ensure that funding is directed towards research that aligns with community needs and priorities.</li></ul></li><li>For Māori research, the submissions from Te Pūtahitanga and Tara McAllister emphasize the need for ring-fenced base grant funding that is determined and controlled by Māori. They argue that this is essential to ensure that Māori research priorities are adequately supported and that funding is used to build Māori research capacity and capability.<ul><li>Submissions also recommend that any base grant funding model should be designed to incentivize institutions to address equity and diversity issues. This could involve setting requirements for institutions to demonstrate their commitment to diversity and inclusion in their workforce, or by linking base grant funding to the achievement of specific diversity targets.</li></ul></li><li>Reducing Hypercompetition and Administrative Burden<ul><li>Several submissions highlight the negative impacts of the current hypercompetitive funding environment, where success rates for grant applications are often extremely low. This intense competition creates stress and uncertainty for researchers, discourages collaboration, and can lead to a focus on &quot;safe&quot; research that is more likely to be funded but may not be the most innovative or impactful.</li></ul></li><li>The submissions recommend reforming competitive funding mechanisms to reduce hypercompetition and the administrative burden on researchers.<ul><li>This could involve introducing mechanisms such as pre-proposals, rolling deadlines, and smaller funding packages, which would allow researchers to get early feedback on their ideas and reduce the time and effort spent on unsuccessful applications.</li></ul></li><li>Targeted Funding for Diversity and Career Development<ul><li>Many submissions recommend targeted funding initiatives to support diversity and career development in the research workforce.</li></ul></li><li>This could include expanding fellowship schemes, particularly for early career researchers and researchers from underrepresented groups.<ul><li>Submissions also recommend investing in training and development programmes to help researchers develop the skills they need for diverse career paths, both within and outside of academia.</li></ul></li><li>Specific recommendations include:<ul><li>Dedicated funding to strengthen diversity among early career researchers.</li><li>Strengthening funder requirements around equity, diversity, and inclusion, including policies and procedures that support the progression and retention of underrepresented groups in research.</li><li>Targeted funding schemes or block grants for research institutions to build capability and capacity in equity, diversity, and inclusion.</li><li>Promoting Collaboration and Mobility</li></ul></li><li>Submissions highlight the importance of promoting collaboration and mobility within the research system. This includes enabling researchers to move between different research organisations, sectors, and disciplines, and to work in partnership with communities and end-users.<ul><li>Funding mechanisms could be designed to incentivize collaborative research, such as requiring partnerships between researchers from different institutions or disciplines as a condition of funding.</li><li>Funding could also be provided to support mobility, such as through secondments, internships, and exchange programmes.</li></ul></li><li>By implementing these recommendations, the New Zealand research funding system can be transformed into one that supports a stable, sustainable, and diverse research workforce that can effectively address the complex challenges facing the country.</li></ul><h1>The White Paper</h1><h2>Identifed Challenges</h2><p>Main Issues with New Zealand&#39;s RSI System The &quot;Te Ara Paerangi - Future Pathways White Paper 2022&quot; identifies several key issues with the current research, science, and innovation (RSI) system in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>These issues can be grouped into four main themes that the White Paper uses to structure its reform programme:</p><ul><li>Failure to Give Sufficient Expression to Te Tiriti o Waitangi: The current RSI system fails to adequately uphold the commitments in, and the spirit of, Te Tiriti o Waitangi. This is reflected in a lack of Māori leadership and participation in investment decision-making, as well as the low proportion of funding that supports Māori researchers.</li><li>Limited Diversity: The RSI system struggles to attract and retain Māori and Pacific Peoples, who face structural barriers in the workforce. Women are also underrepresented in senior roles. This lack of diversity stifles creativity and perpetuates the status quo.</li><li>Career Instability and Precarity: The current system features unproductive competition for grants and limited opportunities for early to mid-career researchers. This results in a challenging and precarious work environment that hinders career progression and impacts the wellbeing of researchers.</li><li>Lack of Focus and Responsiveness: The RSI system lacks a clear strategic direction and is not effectively aligned with the government&#39;s social, environmental, and economic objectives. This results in a cluttered research landscape with a proliferation of investment signals, ineffective resource allocation, and unclear roles and responsibilities.</li></ul><p>The White Paper notes that the RSI system is too small and under increasing pressure due to the limited investment in research. New Zealand&#39;s research investment is significantly lower than other small, advanced economies. The increasing competition for limited funding exacerbates the issues of career precarity and unproductive competition within the system.</p><p>The White Paper emphasizes that a well-functioning RSI system is essential for the cultural, social, environmental, and economic well-being of all New Zealanders. It acknowledges that the current system has positive aspects, but significant changes are needed to ensure it can effectively contribute to New Zealand&#39;s future prosperity.</p><h2>Proposed Objectives</h2><p>To address these issues, the White Paper proposes a transformative reform of the RSI system that prioritises:</p><p>Embedding Te Tiriti o Waitangi into the design of the RSI system to support Māori aspirations and enable Māori to pursue their own priorities</p><p>Valuing the people in the system by promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, and providing more stable and sustainable career pathways Building system agility to create a more focused, connected, and responsive system that can effectively address the most important challenges facing Aotearoa New Zealand</p><p>Produced by the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment (MBIE) outlining a multi-year plan to reform New Zealand&#39;s Research, Science, and Innovation (RSI) system. The document highlights key challenges facing the current system, such as a lack of focus on national priorities, inadequate investment, poor integration, and underrepresentation of Māori and Pacific peoples.</p><p>It proposes four main objectives to address these issues:</p><ol><li>Creating New Futures</li><li>Embedding Te Tiriti</li><li>Valuing Our People</li><li>and Building System Agility</li></ol><p>The paper advocates for a more collaborative and responsive RSI system that prioritizes Māori and Pacific aspirations, supports diverse career paths, and fosters greater global connectivity. To achieve these goals, the document sets out a phased implementation plan, including the establishment of National Research Priorities, increased funding, and potential institutional reforms. The paper aims to provide a guiding document for decision-making and action as the reform programme unfolds.</p><h1>The death of Te Ara Paerangi</h1><p><a href="https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-news-new-zealand-2024-2-new-zealands-future-pathways-programme-hits-dead-end/">https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-news-new-zealand-2024-2-new-zealands-future-pathways-programme-hits-dead-end/</a></p><p><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/new-zealand-scraps-science-reform-plan-prompting-fears-budget-cuts">https://www.science.org/content/article/new-zealand-scraps-science-reform-plan-prompting-fears-budget-cuts</a></p><p><a href="https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/events/2749-pathways-forward-the-science-sector-after-te-ara-paerangi">https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/events/2749-pathways-forward-the-science-sector-after-te-ara-paerangi</a></p><p><a href="https://scientists.org.nz/te-ara-paerangi-panel">https://scientists.org.nz/te-ara-paerangi-panel</a></p><h1>Save Science Coalition</h1><p><a href="https://scientists.org.nz/te-ara-paerangi-panel">https://scientists.org.nz/te-ara-paerangi-panel</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIOm7qOMMb4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIOm7qOMMb4</a></p><p><a href="https://scientists.org.nz/Save-Science-Coalition">https://scientists.org.nz/Save-Science-Coalition</a></p><p><a href="https://scientists.org.nz/news/13423877">https://scientists.org.nz/news/13423877</a></p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>The stoppage of Te Ara Paerangi is a warning story. It is a demonstration of a comprehensive consultation processes being wasted at the alter of austerity and neoliberalism. These ideologies and the shills that peddle them, have significantly delayed the capacity of New Zealanders to advance their science and innovation sector to meet the needs of their increasingly vulnerable communities in the name of wealth consolidation for the rich, land-owning class.</p><p>It is a story of how the <a href="/encyclopedia/NACTNZF">Coalition Government</a> ignores both the advice of experts and the public in order to line their own pockets with the wealth of corporate and foreign interests which have that expense returned to them from the public purse. Wretched politicians are facilitating the theft of social institutions, health, wealth, and community and taking their cut for themselves.</p><p>Not only is the cancellation of Te Ara Paerangi inefficient (they threw away four years of planning and consultation from highly skilled researchers and consultants) – but it is also a sale of our future. They have thrown away investment into the future of New Zealand and its people. Plans to enhance the research system to solve wicked problems, tackle global and local challenges, look after our rivers, lakes, tamariki, health, communities, wildlife, and more have all been thrown away. That is, they have been sold to the highest bidder. The cuts to the science sector come from the same place as cuts to the health system, education, and other public services – they come from the bribes of the real-estate and tobacco industries into the pockets of right-wing politicians who have infested the New Zealand government.</p></section><section class="footer"><ul><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></section></body>
