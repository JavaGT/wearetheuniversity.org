Send an email to <a href="mailto:teagaunion@gmail.com">teagaunion@gmail.com</a> if you would like to get involved in our mahi.</p><p><a href="http://www.teaga.co.nz/our-team/">Source</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><h1>Our aims</h1><p>Job cuts in the tertiary education sector will have wide reaching impacts in terms of the quality of our teaching and research, as well as career pathways for graduates.</p><p>Data collected by Education Counts paints a bleak picture of who will be most affected by cuts to contract academic staff. In 2019, 62.6% of people employed as part-time ‘other academic/tutoring staff’ in our universities, were women. Additionally, a third of all Māori (31.6%) and Pasifika (32.4%) academics in universities were employed in these positions. Thus, the elimination of these contracts – which are often stepping stones to permanent roles – will only further disrupt an already pakaru (broken) pathway for Indigenous scholars.</p><h2>1. Precarious work must be the exception not the norm</h2><p>Early-career academics who regularly take contract work at Universities post-phd must eventually be provided a pathway to permanent employment.</p><p>All new positions of at least 28 days (or 150 hours) must be advertised, including a note if there is an existing internal candidate being considered.</p><h2>2. Transparency in how contracted hours are calculated</h2><p>Universities must justify how they calculate the total number of hours presented in casual or fixed-term contract work, including evidence-based estimates for specific tasks.</p><p>When a course buyout is initiated, a contract lecturer should receive a minimum percentage of the underlying buyout value for that course.</p><h2>3. No wage below the living wage</h2><p>Any position specifying the labour of a postgraduate student or an early-career researcher should at least be set at the current living wage.</p><p>Payment for casual and fixed term positions must also include the pre-contract phase of preparation (contract matters, preliminary meetings and email contact).</p><h2>4. Equity for Māori &amp; Pasifika</h2><p>Postgraduate-led programs which enhance achievement for Māori &amp; Pasifika students must be protected. This includes precarious positions where cuts will have a disproportionate impact on Māori and Pasifika.</p><p>Universities must demonstrate their commitment to transitioning Māori post-PhD toward becoming early-career academics, in accordance with their obligations under Te Tiriti.</p><h2>5. Collaboration with, not exploitation of international students</h2><p>International students should be properly informed of the cost of living in New Zealand cities and job opportunities before enrolling. They should also be better protected from exploitation by the private sector including landlords and employers.</p><p>International PhD students and post-phd international alumni are important contributors to New Zealand’s knowledge economy and community. All post-phd international alumni should have the option of taking up residency upon successfully completing their studies and be eligible for post-study scholarships.</p><h2>6. A career pathway for PhD alumni</h2><p>Post-phd institutional access and affiliation should be available for up to five years, for those that require it, including the ability to compete for grant funding.</p><p>A greater number of postdoctoral scholarships should be funded, benefiting both early-career academics and the universities that they are affiliated with.</p><h2>7. More postgraduate research positions</h2><p>Research and development has broad benefits for society, yet New Zealand sits well below the OECD average. Funding for early-career researchers should be expanded by government, i.e., increasing the number of Marsden grants.</p><p>Overheads charged by universities often make the employment of postgraduate researchers a nonviable proposition for successful grant applicants, these overheads must be curtailed.</p><h2>8. Reintroduction of a student allowance for postgraduate students</h2><p>A means-tested allowance should be available to all postgraduate students. There should be no parental means test for postgraduate students living away from home.</p><p>The student allowance and accommodation supplement should represent the basic requirements for a postgraduate student to manage their cost of living expenses.</p><h2>9. A better job on mental health</h2><p>Access to mental health services should also be available free of charge to all postgraduate and post PhD affiliated alumni.</p><p>All postgraduate students – domestic and international – should have an option to suspend their studies in extraordinary circumstances which are reasonable, non-intrusive and without disadvantage.</p><h2>10. Undergraduate students should not be disadvantaged by online teaching</h2><p>A permanent move to online teaching risks diminishing the quality of learning experiences, and exacerbates student equity issues. Robust consultation is required before any such changes are made.</p><p>Blended learning should be limited to where it is of a demonstrable benefit to students, and not just used as a mechanism for cost-cutting.</p><p><a href="http://www.teaga.co.nz/our-aims/">Source</a></p></blockquote></section><section class="footer"><ul><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></section></body>
