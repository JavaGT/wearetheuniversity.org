need for national conversation</p><p>The New Zealand Union of
Students’ Associations (NZUSA) is calling for a national
conversation about student debt in light of a recent study
about rising loans for medical students.</p><p>A recent
University of Auckland study has found that medical students
are carrying higher levels of student loan debt year on
year; and that this could impact their choice to enter
careers that are more highly paid over areas of high
need.</p><p>‘When graduates might be choosing to enter careers
that are more highly paid over areas of high need, it shows
how rising student debt creates real implications on society
as a whole’, says National President Jonathan Gee.</p><p>The
findings follow a recent study by NZUSA which assessed the
implications of student loan debt on a graduates’
future.</p><p>The Income and Expenditure Report 2017 found that
78% of students feel that their debt will have a significant
impact on their ability to save for their retirement. It
also found that repayment times were increasing, with
significant inequalities between repayment times for men and
women, and Pākeha compared with Māori and
Pasifika.</p><p>‘We must also consider those who might be
locked out from even considering a career in medicine due to
high costs. Large student loan debt for qualifications such
as medicine create a poverty of opportunity for many of our
poorest families’, Gee said.</p>

<p>Gee says that rising
student debt requires immediate action by the Government.
The first step would be by addressing the rising cost of
living for students. Living costs make up a third of the
national student loan balance.</p><p>‘An immediate step to
lessen the burden of student loan debt is to increase access
to the Student Allowance, which currently only 33% of
students have access to.’</p><p>Gee says that, more
importantly, a national conversation about student debt
needs to take place in order to combat inequality.</p><p>‘Loan
debt is not just a student issue. Tertiary education is a
public good and we owe it to future generations to have a
national conversation about student debt and its impact on
society.’</p><p>NZUSA is the national voice of students in
tertiary education. The organisation is governed by
students’ associations from universities and polytechnics
around the
country.</p><p>ENDS
