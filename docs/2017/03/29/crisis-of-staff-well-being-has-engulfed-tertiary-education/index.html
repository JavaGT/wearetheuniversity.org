<p>EVIDENCE
SHOWS A ‘CRISIS OF STAFF WELL-BEING’ HAS ENGULFED
TERTIARY EDUCATION UNDER NATIONAL AND IS HARMING
STUDENTS</p>

<p><strong>Staff at tertiary education institutions
are experiencing higher levels of stress, unsustainable
workloads and are feeling more alienated from their jobs
compared to a decade ago and reforms introduced by the
National government are to blame, the results of a survey
[1] published today by the Tertiary Education Union (TEU)
show.</strong></p>

<p>Findings in the report suggest that reforms
introduced by National have increased pressure on staff to
change grades, dedicate less time to teaching and change
admission rules, all of which lead to lower education
outcomes for students. Overall the report shows that, since
coming to power, National has presided over a period of
rapidly declining staff well-being in tertiary education
making the sector one of the most highly stressed in New
Zealand.</p>

<p>Publication of the report comes one week after
the Productivity Commission [3] concluded that National’s
approach to tertiary education has not worked and is failing
to serve the needs of students, staff and local
communities.</p>

<p>Findings in the TEU report show that in the
last ten years:</p>

<p>· The pressure to pass a higher
percentage of students to meet government targets has become
worse for 63 percent of over 1,000 survey respondents<p>

<p>·
The pressure to dedicate less time to teaching has become
worse for 55 per cent of respondents</p>

<p>· Support for
improving staff well-being has become worse for 70 percent
of respondents and one-third of staff who took part in the
survey say they no longer feel able to support student
well-being</p>

<p>· Reported stress levels have increased to
seven out of 10, where 10 represents extreme stress -
significantly higher than the average New Zealander who has
a stress level of 5.5 according to recent research
[3].</p>

<p>The report’s findings provide a stark warning about
the future risks to the sector as National plans to continue
rolling out its market-based agenda. Legislation recently
introduced by Tertiary Education Minister, Paul Goldsmith,
would extend the reforms that both the TEU and Productivity
Commission’s reports show are failing staff and students
[4].</p>

<p>Commenting on the findings, Sandra Grey, TEU national
president, said: <strong>“Staff in the tertiary education
sector are dedicated to their jobs and expect to work hard,
but they should not have to sacrifice their well-being to
the job. I speak to far too many members who are exhausted
from the constant stress and feel that they have no say in
how their institutions are run </strong>. <strong>If staff
are going to give our students the best possible education,
they need to feel supported and be given time to be human
away from their jobs, rather than constantly struggling
under the weight of impossible demands imposed on them by
National.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“We can see from this report
that over the past decade the partnership between tertiary
education staff and the National government has broken down
to the point where the sector is now engulfed in a crisis of
staff well-being. If there is one lesson we can take from
this report it’s that we must deal with the root cause of
declining staff well-being. This includes ending
National’s failed experiment to make competition and
profit the driving forces of tertiary education, rather than
staff and students.”</strong></p>

<p>Cat Pausé, TEU women’s
vice president, said: <strong>“The findings that show
staff are experiencing unsustainable workloads is
particularly worrisome for women staff, who already do a
great deal of work that isn't recognised, such as tending to
the emotional needs and concerns of students. Women in the
sector have to deal with enormous pressure from increasing
workloads, while also trying to ensure the well-being of
students.”</strong></p>

<p>Phil Edwards, TEU industrial and
professional vice president, said <strong>: “What concerns
me is that the low-levels of well-being shown in this report
will only get worse as National cut even more funding to
tertiary education and seek to reform the sector to put
profits ahead of students. A significant cause of stress and
declining well-being is the feeling that staff are losing
control of their workloads. Every institution can take a
huge step towards addressing this by involving staff in
decisions that impact on them. Successfully tackling the
issues this report identifies isn't just about individuals,
it’s about addressing the problems National’s reforms
have caused right across the tertiary education system.”
