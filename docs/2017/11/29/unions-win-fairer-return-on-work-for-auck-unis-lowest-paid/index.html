Members of the TEU and Public Service Association have been meeting this week to discuss the proposed settlement and to vote on whether it should be put to a ballot [2].</p><p>From February next year, eight of the 200 people working at the university who are currently paid less than $40,000 would see their pay increase to $40,000 or more per annum - rising to 70 people in 2019. This will mean people who do so much to make studying at Auckland possible can now look forward to taking home more to help meet the city’s rising living costs and to provide for their families.</p><p>Enzo Giordani, lead advocate for the unions at the University of Auckland and one of the organisers of the Tertiary Education Union branch, said: “People who work so hard to make the University of Auckland a great place to work and study deserve to make a decent living. It is thanks to our members coming together over the last year that we have ensured the lowest paid people working at the university receive a fairer return on their work.</p><p></p><p>“We have been talking to our members this week about what the proposed settlement would mean for them and their colleagues, many of whom can now look forward to earning enough to make ends meet in an increasingly expensive city, to provide for their families and whānau, or to have a little extra so they can do more fun things together at the weekend.</p><p>“At moments like this, where we have shown the collective strength of unions, it is important also to recognise the Vice-Chancellor for working with us and for addressing our members’ efforts to ensure people working at the university are paid enough to reach an acceptable, if modest, standard of living.”</p><p>Notes to Editors</p><p>1. The proposed settlement includes the following:</p><p>A two-year term<br>A 1.4% pay increase on 1 February 2018 for all staff paid $40,000 or more per annum and a minimum 1.6% pay increase from 1 February 2019, or the university's across the board increase, whichever is greater)<br>A pay increase of up to 4% on 1 February 2018 for all staff paid less than $40,000 per annum, with a further pay increase of up to 4% on 1 February 2019 (for those still paid less than $40,000 per annum).<br>2. The Tertiary Education Union and Public Service Association are party to the Collective Agreement at the University of Auckland. Both unions were represented on the team that negotiated successfully for the proposed settlement.</p><p>--ENDS--</p><p></p></section></body>
