     &lt;strong&gt;Students welcome free public transport
</code></pre>
<p>announcement</strong></p><p>Students have welcomed the Green
Party’s announcement today of free off-peak public
transport for tertiary students. The policy covers students
at university, polytechnic, wānanga, private training
establishments, and people training through apprenticeships.
The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA)
says that free public transport for students puts the
country one step closer to a tertiary education free of
unfair barriers.</p><p>‘Students are telling us that after
paying for rent, they barely have enough to cover other
basic needs like getting to class. Students can’t succeed
if they can’t afford to get to class, so any policy which
improves student mobility is a step in the right
direction’, says National President Jonathan Gee.</p><p>The
announcement follows the release of NZUSA’s 2017 Income
and Expenditure Report, <i>The Cost of Being a Student in
New Zealand</i>, which found that rapidly rising rent prices
meant students were left with very little cash for other
basic needs such as public transport.</p><p>Eastern Institute of
Technology Students’ Association (EITSA) has been working
to get free transport for their students in partnership with
Eastern Institute of Technology, Napier City Council,
Hastings District Council and Hawkes Bay Regional Council.
EITSA spokesperson Moana Potaka says, ‘If students can’t
get to class, they can’t succeed in class. Providing free
transport may seem a basic option, but for our students that
can mean the difference between affording essentials, or
attending lectures.’</p>

<p>Victoria University of Wellington
Students’ Association (VUWSA) has long campaigned for a
student discount on public transport in the Wellington
region, including lobbying the Greater Wellington Regional
Council. VUWSA President Rory Lenihan-Ikin says, ‘Students
are telling us the cost of getting to class is so high that
they’re skipping class. This is backed by lecturers who
have seen their class numbers drop as the cost of living for
students grows each year.’</p><p>‘Having student fares on
public transport is the norm for most major cities around
the world, so these policies would bring us a step closer to
competing globally for more people to live, study and go on
to work in New Zealand,’ says Lenihan-Ikin.</p><p>NZUSA is the
national voice of students in tertiary education. The
organisation is governed by students’ associations from
universities and polytechnics around the
country.</p><p><br>ENDS</p><p><br>
