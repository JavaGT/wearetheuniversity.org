</code></pre>
<p>students and good for the country</p><p> </p><p>The New Zealand
Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) is welcoming
public support for increased financial assistance for
students. A Newshub-Reid Research poll released last night
showed that 68% agreed that students should get more support
from the Government, including 53% of National party
voters.</p><p> </p><p>‘All we’re asking for is enough to live
on. Most students don’t get an allowance, and even when
they do, it barely covers rent – let alone other basic
needs,’ says National President Jonathan Gee.</p><p> </p><p>Only
one in three of students are eligible for the Student
Allowance, which is also abated based on parental income.
The maximum level of Student Allowance is $178.81, plus an
Accommodation Benefit of up to $40. Students who cannot get
the allowance, can instead borrow a student loan of $176.86
for living costs. It is also not enough to live on. The
average rent for a room in Wellington is $200 per week, in
central Auckland it is $250.</p><p> </p><p>‘A third of the total
student loan balance is for living costs, and it has ongoing
ramifications for borrowers: deterring further study,
depressing disposable income, delaying saving and home
ownership.’</p><p> </p><p>‘Debt has a massive impact on our
future social workers, nurses, teachers and mechanics, and
reducing the pressure on them has flow on benefits for
everyone.’</p><p> </p><p>Long repayment times means that the
student loan scheme also costs the government, meaning the
switch from loans to grants costs less than it first
appears. There will be savings in the student loan scheme
when students move from borrowing to getting a student
allowance.</p>

<p> </p><p>‘Students, their parents and their
grandparents, and intending students, tell us they want
enough to live while they study, to address the acute
financial crisis that students currently face – and to
graduate with less debt. The poll confirms that the rest of
the country agrees.’</p><p> </p><p>‘It’s time for all parties
to respond to this call. Better financial support is good
for students, and good for the country.’</p><p>
