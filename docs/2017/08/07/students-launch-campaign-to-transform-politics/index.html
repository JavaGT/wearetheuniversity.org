 &lt;p&gt;
     7 August 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students launch campaign to
</code></pre>
<p>transform politics</strong></p><p><br>Students and young people
across the country have joined a national movement to change
the way we do politics in Aotearoa. Unashamedly ambitious,
the We Have Power campaign aims to get every student to vote
in the upcoming general election.</p><p>The campaign launches
digitally on social media today. The website, <a href="http://wehavepower.org.nz/" target="_blank">wehavepower.org.nz</a>, will also go live
concurrently with the digital launch. The campaign has
already reached 15 tertiary campuses across the country at
the time of launch.</p><p>&#39;We Have Power is based on the belief
that students and young people are a change making, powerful
political force when we turn out and vote. This is the 
beginning of a political transformation to make politics
work better for us on the issues that we need it to’, says
spokesperson Jonathan Gee.</p><p>The campaign was inspired by
young political movements overseas such as the surge in
youth voting in the recent UK election, and ‘big
organising’ models of campaigning in the 2016 US
primaries.</p><p>We Have Power (WHP) volunteer Kealyn Marshall
(Te Atihaunui a Paparangi, Ngā Rauru, Te Whanau a Apanui),
21, first time voter and teaching student at Victoria
University, says ‘the reason why I&#39;ve taken more interest
around this year’s elections is following the impact that
young voters had during the UK elections that a difference
can actually be made.’</p><p>WHP works in three ways. First,
it’s about mass volunteer mobilisation of young people
across Aotearoa. Second, it’s about training those
volunteers to have political conversations with their
communities - through facebanking, textbanking, and in
person in their flats, halls, lecture theatres, sports
clubs, faith groups - or anywhere they connect with other
young people. Third, it’s a hardline get out the vote
where our volunteers go to the polls and vote alongside the
people they’ve spoken with.</p>

<div class="headline-right"></div>

</div></div>
<p>This style of campaigning is
bold. It’s about using new technologies, and the social
connections that define the lives of many young people to
bring their ways of doing politics to the
election.</p><p>‘Students and young people are an incredibly
diverse community and no one size fits all approach has any
hope of being successful. Our campus teams have the ability
to speak to the communities they know best, and in ways that
make sense to them,’ says Jonathan.</p><p>‘We Have Power
aims to flip the misconstrued narrative that low youth voter
turnout is due to apathy. Instead, the movement believes
that politics has failed to speak to the aspirations,
experiences and lived realities of young people which has
led to this disillusionment. By voting, we have the power to
change things.’</p><p>WHP volunteer Moana Potaka (Ngati
Whakaue, Tapuika, Waitaha, Ngati Wai), 28, business studies
student at Eastern Institute of Technology, says ‘many of
the barriers to education facing students like low income,
poor housing, and lack of ability to travel to campus can be
fixed by politicians. If politicians used their power to
stand up for students, students would use their power to
vote them into Parliament.’</p><p>WHP volunteer Emily Barker,
22, fine arts student at the University of Canterbury says
it is crucial that we empower young people to vote, ‘at
the end of the day, we will inherit the outcomes of this
election.’</p><p>We Have Power is a campaign coordinated by
the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations
(NZUSA).</p><p>ENDS</p><p><br>
