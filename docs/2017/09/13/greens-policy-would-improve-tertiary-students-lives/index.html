     13 September 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greens’ policy would improve
</code></pre>
<p>tertiary students’ lives</p><p></p><p>The New Zealand Union
of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) has called the Greens’
student policy announcement today a positive step forward in
improving students’ lives. The policy includes introducing
a universal student allowance for postgraduate students and
brings together past announcements relating to free off-peak
public transport for students, free counselling services for
under-25s and winter energy subsidies for low-income
earners.</p><p>National President Jonathan Gee says
‘students are looking for policies that speak to their
lived experiences. Transport and energy costs are big
drivers of student poverty, and poor mental health is too
often correlated with tertiary study. This policy package is
a positive step towards making a difference in students’
lives.’</p><p>The package responds to over half the
recommendations outlined in NZUSA’s Income and Expenditure
Report 2017, which shines a light on the real cost of being
a student in New Zealand.</p><p>‘We have long said that
tertiary study should be a way out of poverty, not a way
into it. We’re glad that the Greens have heeded our calls,
particularly around removing the lifetime limit on student
loan borrowing and allowances, and moving towards a
universal student allowance for all those in tertiary
study.’</p><p>Gee warned, however, that a real plan
towards a universal allowance must be a priority for any
future government.</p><p>‘Students tell us that they
need help surviving now, but are also worried about the
impact of student debt on the rest of their lives. The
Greens have acknowledged the unfairness of students being
the only group in society expected to borrow just to get by,
and we strongly urge them to end this discrimination.’</p><p>ENDS</p>
