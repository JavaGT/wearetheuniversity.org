     27 July 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minister’s commitment to student-centred
</code></pre>
<p>tertiary education system needs teeth</p><p>The New Zealand
Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) has welcomed the
Government’s commitment to a student-centred tertiary
education system, but warns the outlined work programme will
not give effect to this goal.</p><p>The commitment comes out of
the Government’s response to the Productivity Commission
report on new models of tertiary education, released
yesterday. In the response, Tertiary Education, Skills and
Employment Minister Paul Goldsmith outlined a commitment to
creating a student-centred system in which informed and
engaged students can access the education opportunities best
suited to them.</p><p>‘While efforts to provide better
information, mobility and careers education are welcome,
this only goes part-way in empowering students to optimise
their tertiary experience. The other part is engaging and
involving students as partners and co-producers in their own
learning experience, the Minister’s plan is silent in
these areas,’ says National President Jonathan
Gee.</p><p>‘New Zealand should be more ambitious in pursuing
international best practice for students, specifically
through investing in capacity building to enhance student
voice.’</p><p>International best practice in the sector
acknowledges the importance of student voice in governance
and decision-making, and in assuring quality. Some of this
work has already started, for example with NZUSA’s
Memorandum of Understanding with the Academic Quality Agency
which supports students as auditors in assessing university
academic quality.</p>

<p>On other aspects of the Government’s
response to the Commission’s report, NZUSA is pleased that
the Minister has rejected recommendations around interest on
student loans and variable subsidies to tuition fees for
courses of ‘high private return’. We are also pleased
that he is willing to explore developing a framework for
tertiary teaching. However, Gee was cautious at suggestions
to continue to consider changes to fee regulation and to
review the requirement for research-led teaching in
degree-level study.</p><p>‘Barrier-free, affordable and
equitable access to tertiary education needs to be front and
centre of any changes to the system. We would expect active
engagement and consultation with students on any possible
changes to tuition fees or the way we are taught,’ Gee
says.</p><p>In referring to the Minister’s commitment that
tertiary education should meet the needs of industry and
employers, NZUSA noted that students’ needs also need to
be prioritised.</p><p>‘The Minister himself referred to the
importance of tertiary education in deepening our
understanding of ourselves, our history, the world and
finding solutions to our many challenges. Skills that match
with the needs of industry are essential, but we must
equally prioritise tertiary education’s role as a powerful
social lever that transforms the lives of individuals and
their communities.’</p><p>‘We look forward to working with
Government to ensure that tertiary education is working best
for students.’</p><p>NZUSA is the national voice of students
in tertiary education. The organisation is governed by
students' associations from universities and polytechnics
around the
country.</p><p>ENDS<br>
