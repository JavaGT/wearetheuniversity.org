     9 October 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of financial support contributes
</code></pre>
<p>to decline in tertiary enrolments</p><p> </p><p>The New Zealand
Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) says that
financial support is failing to meet the rising costs of
being a student, amid tertiary enrolments reaching its
lowest point in more than a decade.</p><p> </p><p>Ministry of
Education figures show that there were 353,000 enrolments in
2016, down from 423,000 in 2009. While part of this decline
was down to demographic changes in the number of school
leavers, this was not the only reason, argues National
President Jonathan Gee.</p><p> </p><p>One of the biggest drops has
been in the over 40 age group, from 6.7% in 2008 to 3.6% in
2016.</p><p> </p><p>‘By restricting student allowances for those
over 40, the Government has sent a clear signal that to
these prospective students that they don’t want to support
their living costs while they seek to adapt to the
ever-changing future of work.’</p><p> </p><p>The decline in
enrolments from those in the 20-24 age group also suggests
that cost is a factor.</p><p> </p><p>‘A number of students have
opted to take ‘gap years’ halfway through their studies,
as they choose to earn rather than learn to keep up with the
rising cost of living. They’re also opting for gap years
to reassess the suitability of their course, suggesting that
we need better careers education to give students a clearer
picture of their tertiary journey.’</p><p> </p><p>While Gee
acknowledges that most of the decline has occurred in
low-level courses, he questions why these students have not
opted to stay in tertiary education at higher levels.</p>

</p><p>‘Increasing tertiary education quality is important,
but making it accessible to all is equally vital.  There are
tens of thousands of young people not in education,
employment or training who we need to reach.’</p><p> </p><p>New
Zealand sits at around the OECD average (42%) when it comes
25-34 year olds holding a tertiary qualification (40%). Yet
countries which we typically compare ourselves to have much
higher proportions, such as Australia (49%), the United
Kingdom (50%) and Canada (59%). Gee says this shows that we
can do better when it comes to tertiary education
participation.</p><p> </p><p>‘People around the world have said
that the best anti-poverty programme is education. Tertiary
education results in more stable work, better health over
time, reduced incarceration rates and higher employment.
Greater tertiary education participation is ultimately good
for New Zealand. We can do better.’</p><p>
