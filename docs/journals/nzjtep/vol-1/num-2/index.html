Rewarding Individual Research Excellence In The PBRF
Paul Dalziel,
Lincoln University
Abstract
The Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) is intended to encourage and reward research
excellence by assessing research quality in New Zealand’s tertiary education organisations. Unlike the
British research assessment exercise, the PBRF reports personal quality grades to individual
academics. This component is not well designed. It neglects core principles of fairness, transparency
and confidentiality. It fails to recognise international and national standard research below ‘world-
class’. It is very discouraging to emerging researchers. The essay argues that the PBRF should focus
on its primary role of allocating research funds through assessing institutions rather than attempting to
assess individuals.
Rewarding individual research excellence in the performance-based research fund
The primary goal of the Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) is to ensure that
excellent research in the tertiary education sector is encouraged and rewarded. (TEC,
2004b, p. 3)
The Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) is intended to encourage and reward research
excellence by assessing research quality in New Zealand’s tertiary education organisations (TEOs)
‘comprehensively, systematically and authoritatively’ (TEC, 2004a, par. 32). These assessments take
place at two levels. First, TEC publishes quality scores for subject areas and academic units, and for
each TEO. The TEO scores are used with two other performance indicators (postgraduate research
degree completions and external research income) to allocate public research funds to TEOs, thus
providing a direct financial reward for research excellence. The subject area and academic unit quality
ratings provide indirect financial rewards through reputation effects among potential students and
research purchasers. Second, eligible staff in the TEOs are provided with their individual quality
rating on a four-point scale (labelled A, B, C and R). These personal grades are not reported publicly,
although the numbers of staff receiving each grade in each subject area in each TEO are published
(allowing some individual results to be identified), and they can be used by individuals when applying
for promotion or a new position (TEC, 2002, par. 89). This provides direct feedback to individual
researchers on their assessed research quality during the previous six years.
This essay focuses on this latter feature of New Zealand’s PBRF, for three reasons. First,
individual reporting of results is a significant departure from the British research assessment exercise
(RAE), upon which the PBRF is modelled to a large degree (TEC, 2004a, p. x). The RAE does not
report individual assessments ‘as a matter of principle’ (RAE, 2004, par. 53), and so it is useful to ask
why that principle should be disregarded in New Zealand. Second, the question of whether the proper
unit of assessment in the PBRF should be the individual researcher has been ‘a matter of some
controversy within the tertiary education sector’ (TEC, 2004d, par. 43). The Association of University
Staff, for example, has advocated group-based assessment. Third, this essay will argue that the
individual component of the PBRF has not been well-designed as a standard exercise in individual
assessment. This undermines the confidence of academic researchers in the PBRF.

The essay proceeds in three parts. Section 1 argues that as an exercise in individual assessment
the PBRF neglects core principles accepted within the tertiary sector for academic assessment of
individual work. Section 2 argues that labelling the second and third quality categories as nothing
better than ‘very good’ and ‘good’ does not reward international or national levels of research
excellence. Section 3 argues that the fourth quality category in the PBRF twists the ‘research-inactive’
category in the British RAE to produce a terrible outcome for emerging researchers given this label.
The essay ends with a brief conclusion.</p>
<ol>
<li>The PBRF as an Exercise in Individual Assessment
Academics are not opposed to individual assessment. To the contrary, academics are typically
involved in a host of assessment exercises every year. Most courses taught by academics have at last
one piece of internal assessment and usually a final exam. Research students submit their theses to
examiners for assessment at the end of their studies. The quality of research papers submitted to
refereed journals is assessed in peer reviews. Applications to external funding agencies almost always
involve an assessment of the proposal’s expected outputs against the objectives of the agencies.
Academic staff members are assessed for contributions to their TEO whenever they apply for salary
advancement, promotion or a new position. It is precisely because individual assessment is so
ubiquitous in the tertiary sector that certain fundamental principles have come to be universally
accepted as essential for good assessment. Included among these are fairness, transparency and
confidentiality. Consider, then, the following features of the PBRF 2003 assessment against these
three principles.
1.1 Fairness
The chair of the Moderation Panel in the 2003 PBRF was Professor Paul Callaghan, a very
distinguished New Zealand scientist. Nobody is better placed to understand how the quality
assessments were carried out in the PBRF. On 21 May 2004, the Royal Society of New Zealand Social
Sciences Committee hosted a PBRF Forum, and the published proceedings record the following
comments by Professor Callaghan on the individual fairness of the PBRF (Callaghan, 2004, pages not
numbered):
In terms of individual persons, yes, it was in many cases unfair. I know many people who
got grades that don’t seem, on the face of it, what they should be. And I accept that. I
would say in all honesty, if you looked at the boundaries of AB or BC or CR, you’ve got
about a plus or minus 20% accuracy there. … Is that reasonable? I reckon it’s the best we
could do. I think if you get a lot of different people together they approach things in a
different way. And I passionately believe in qualitative judgement. I believe in getting
good people on panels, making their best judgements they can. But, at the end of the day,
there are personal differences in the way these things are seen. So I think we did it as we
could. We did it as well as we could, and I think it was as fair as we could make it, but
it’s still unfair for some individuals, I don’t think there’s any doubt about that.
Professor Callaghan’s ‘plus or minus 20% accuracy’ at the boundaries might be assumed to
average out in an institutional assessment exercise. There is still a duty of care to ensure that the rules
and procedures do not introduce any systematic biases (for example, against TEOs with a relatively
high proportion of Māori-focused or applied research), but the presence of individual errors does not
Page 2

itself undermine confidence in an institutional assessment. This is not true, however, if the unit of
assessment moves to the individual. No TEO could continue an assessment scheme that was publicly
recognised by its own chief examiner as unfair for some of the individuals being assessed. This is a
serious problem that undermines the credibility of the PBRF among academics for whom fairness is a
core value.
1.2 Transparency
A key component of any assessment exercise is the set of rules explaining how quality will be
judged. The guidelines for the PBRF seemed clear in advance. The PBRF Working Party, for example,
adopted a principle of comprehensiveness, so that ‘the PBRF should appropriately measure the quality
of the full range of investigative activity that occurs within the sector, regardless of its type, form, or
place of output’ (TEC, 2002, p. 8; see also TEC 2004a, par. 52). Further guidance on this was
provided in guidelines to the panels (TEC, 2003c, p. 217):
EPs with research outputs scoring 6 or 7 should demonstrate leadership and
accomplishment in research exemplified by a platform of world class research that
includes highly original work that ranks with the best of its kind. The use ‘world class’ in
relation to the research output component is not intended to suggest that those research
outputs should relate to international themes, cross national comparisons or are the focus
of international interest. Nor does world class imply research outputs generated by
international collaborations. World class denotes a standard not a type, or focus of
research.
This rule appears not to have been followed by the panels, perhaps because of time constraints (as
predicted by Goldfinch, 2004, p. 47). Thus the Phase 1 evaluation of the PBRF cites a draft peer
review panel report that: ‘unless something is published in an international journal (or one known by
members of the particular panel to be a ‘well-respected journal’) it is not able to attain the quality
standard of ‘world class’’ (WEB Research, 2004, par. 675). Later the WEB review also stated (par.
716): ‘In the absence of clear positive evidence of quality panel members often scored an NRO
[nominated research output] as though the journal in which it was published represented its quality.
This problem and the solution adopted was observed by us on every panel we visited, and described in
the report of a panel we did not visit.’
The issue here is transparency. If TEC publishes guidelines on how quality will be assessed, those
guidelines must be followed. Alternatively, if the WEB Research review is correct that ‘the most
commonly used proxy indicator of quality was the international standing of journals’ (idem), this rule
– and the panels’ rankings of journals – should be made transparent by TEC so that academics can
redirect their research activities accordingly.
1.3 Confidentiality
TEC did not send the personal assessments directly to individuals. Instead, the results were sent
to their employing TEO, who then communicated the result to the staff member. No TEO in New
Zealand would be permitted to adopt a similar procedure, reporting the results of an assessment to a
student’s parents or employer, for example, rather than to the student directly. TEC is naïve in its
expectation that employers will not make use of this information (perhaps informally or even
Page 3
New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1 Number 2, December 2004
unconsciously) given that the aggregated individual assessments generate large financial and
reputation rewards to TEOs.
Further, the PBRF document reporting the 2003 assessments found it necessary to include an
extensive discussion of confidentiality issues in its chapter 4. This was because ‘after the final results
of the 2003 Quality Evaluation had been analysed, it became evident that, if the data were published in
the manner originally intended, interested observers with relevant additional information might be able
to infer the Quality Categories assigned to many PBRF-eligible staff’ (TEC, 2004a, par. 103).
Nevertheless, ‘it was decided to retain the basic reporting framework as announced by the TEC in
May 2003 [even though it was] recognised that this [would] have implications for the possibility that
interested observers might be able to infer the Quality Categories assigned to particular individuals’
(par. 106).
The PBRF was a compulsory exercise for eligible staff in the participating TEOs. If Statistics
New Zealand was faced with a similar dilemma in one of its compulsory surveys, it would never
sacrifice confidentiality under any circumstances. Nor would TEOs generally accept an assessment
reporting framework that would allow the results for some, but not all, members of a class to be
publicly identified.</li>
<li>The Top Three Research Quality Categories
The previous section argued that the PBRF 2003 assessment failed to adopt generally accepted
standards of good practice in individual assessment: fairness, transparency and confidentiality.
Another feature that was damaging to many academics concerns the way in which TEC defined and
assigned the four categories used to report research quality in the PBRF. This section considers the top
three categories; that is, Grades A, B and C.
The title of the original PBRF Working Group’s report in December 2002 was Investing in
Excellence. As noted at the head of this paper, ‘the primary goal of the Performance-Based Research
Fund (PBRF) is to ensure that excellent research in the tertiary education sector is encouraged and
rewarded’ (TEC, 2004b, p. 3). The Acting Chair of TEC at the time the results were released claimed
that ‘the PBRF rewards research activities of national and international excellence’ (TEC, 2004b, p.
1). Despite this focus on excellence, there is no quality category in the PBRF labelled ‘national
excellence’ or ‘international excellence’. Instead, TEC described its top three quality categories as
follows (TEC, 2004b, p. 6):
• “A” signifies research of a world-class standard
• “B” signifies very good quality research
• “C” signifies good quality research
This is in contrast to the most recent RAE in Britain, which adopted three quality classifications:
international quality, national quality and sub-national quality (Roberts, 2003, p. 23, fn. 13). Given the
intention to reward research activities of national and international excellence, it would have been
reasonable for Grades A and B in the PBRF to have been comparable to the top two categories in the
RAE. Indeed TEC (2003a, par. 13) explicitly stated that ‘although the PBRF employs different
Page 4
New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1 Number 2, December 2004
terminology in relation to the quality categories, there are clearly some parallels between the criteria
for quality category “A” and the British standard of “attainable levels of international excellence”’.
TEC also accepted a principle of ‘facilitating, where possible, international comparability (eg the
capacity to compare New Zealand’s performance with that of Britain under the RAE)’ (TEC, 2003b,
par. 14, cited in Williams, 2004, par. 15). At some stage during the implementation of the PBRF 2003
assessment, this principle was lost. As a result, researchers in categories B and C have ended up being
damned with faint praise.
This impression is reinforced by the relative sizes of the top categories in RAE 2001 and PBRF</li>
<li>Although the former did not release individual data, TEC (2003a, par. 12) estimates that up to
20 per cent of eligible staff were of international excellence. No wonder, then, that PBRF expert
Professor Jonathan Boston was dismayed when he first saw the PBRF results (Williams, 2004, par.
17). In the PBRF, the proportion of staff in the top category was just 5.5 per cent (TEC, 2004a, Table
5.1).
At first sight, this figure seems to suggest research quality in New Zealand is well below that in
the United Kingdom. Part of the explanation is that the PBRF includes two additional criteria (peer
esteem and contribution to the research environment), but there is another reason; the PBRF adopted
significantly narrower criteria for its top category than was the case in RAE 2001. Professor Boston
has estimated that the proportion of ‘international level’ researchers in the RAE who would have been
awarded an “A” in the PBRF was ‘in all probability towards the lower end of the 50%-100% range’
(Williams, 2004, par. 38). That is, up to half of the top-ranked academics in RAE 2001 would have
received only a B grade in PBRF 2003. This has important consequences.
First, it means that Grade A in the PBRF is broadly equivalent to the top half of the ‘international
level’ in the RAE. Thus the top grade in the PBRF is effectively what will become the four-star
category in the revised classification system for the next RAE in 2008 (see RAE, 2004, par. 24 and 31,
and Dalziel, 2004). It is proper that the achievements of New Zealand’s four-star researchers should be
celebrated, but the narrow criteria adopted for Grade A mean that the range of attainment within Grade
B is very wide (as noted by the Business and Economics Panel; TEC, 2004c, p. 7). Indeed, Professor
Boston’s analysis suggests that up to 444 Grade B researchers in the PBRF would have been
recognised as international quality in the UK. This is more than 20 per cent of the Grade B
researchers.
The lack of recognition given by the PBRF to New Zealand researchers producing international
standard work below ‘world-class’ is not properly acknowledged by TEC. Here is the summary
comment in its final chapter (TEC 2004a, par. 262):
As emphasised in Chapter 4, exacting standards were set for the attainment of an “A”
Quality Category. The TEC makes no apologies for establishing a high benchmark for the
achievement of world-class standing and for requiring the 12 peer review panels to apply
the agreed assessment framework in a rigorous and consistent manner. A relentless focus
on verifiable quality is essential if the tertiary education sector is to achieve and sustain
internationally competitive levels of research excellence.
Page 5
New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1 Number 2, December 2004
TEC, however, has not adopted a standard based on internationally competitive levels of research
excellence. It imposed narrower criteria, so that 94.5 per cent of eligible researchers in the PBRF (that
is, all but those recognised as world-class) were placed in categories that gave no recognition to
attained levels of national or international excellence. Instead, the phrase used by the PBRF to
describe the best of these researchers was merely ‘very good’.</li>
<li>The Fourth PBRF Category – Grade R
The lowest category in the PBRF was Grade R, officially described as signifying that the
evidence portfolio ‘did not meet the requirements for a “C”’ (TEC, 2004b, p. 6). TEC now emphasises
that ‘the awarding of an “R” does not mean that the staff member in question is necessarily “research-
inactive”’ (2004a, par. 138), but this is disingenuous. It was the PBRF Working Group itself that
originally explained how researchers placed in this category ‘would effectively be considered
research-inactive for the purposes of the PBRF’, despite recognising this ‘could have a negative
impact on their career and morale’ (TEC, 2002, par. 176). In the 2003 assessment, 3,278 staff (39.9
per cent of eligible researchers) were placed in this demoralising “R” category.
The ‘research-inactive’ label comes from the RAE, but it has a different meaning in the United
Kingdom. The RAE context can be explained using a stylised example from New Zealand’s PBRF.
Consider an academic department with seven staff members. Suppose that 2 of the staff are rated A, 4
are rated B and 1 is rated C. This would produce a quality score of 6.6 – the highest for any academic
unit in the PBRF 2003 assessment.
Suppose now that one of the A-rated researchers is awarded a Marsden Fund grant to employ a
post-doctoral fellow, and suppose the appointee initially has no publications to supplement his or her
PhD. Suppose one of the B-rated researchers becomes a member of a FRST-funded research group
that allows the department to employ a recent graduate as a research associate and part-time PhD
student. Finally, suppose new enrolments attracted by the top quality score allow the department to
employ a new lecturer who has a contract to publish his or her PhD thesis as a book, but no
publications to date. Each of these emerging researchers would be assessed as Grade R, and the
quality score of the department would fall from 6.6 to 4.6. Yet the quality of the original team of core
researchers is surely no lower as a result of adding a post-doctoral fellow, a research associate and a
new staff member to their department.
Consequently, the RAE allows each TEO (not the RAE panels) to define some staff as ‘research-
inactive’ so as not to dilute a unit’s overall quality ranking. There is a potential financial penalty (since
research-inactive staff are not counted for public research funding), and it should be noted that the
whole approach is ‘a source of some controversy’ (Roberts, 2003, p. 34; Goldfinch, 2003, p. 49
discusses some of the adverse consequences for junior staff). What is undeniable, however, is that the
TEC’s uncritical adoption of this term in a different context has created outcomes that risk being
‘extremely demoralising to many staff’ (TEC, 2004a, par. 145). Fortunately, it appears to be
universally recognised that this must be changed before the next round, especially for emerging
researchers. For the purposes of this essay, however, it is another illustration of how the design of the
PBRF was careless in considering its impact on individual academics (despite one of the main
objectives of the PBRF being to ‘ensure that funding is available for … new researchers; TEC, 2004a,
par. 51).

Conclusion
In March 2004, the University of Auckland and Victoria University of Wellington sought an
order from the High Court preventing TEC from publishing an international comparison of the
research performance of New Zealand TEOs with that of British Universities. The Vice-Chancellors
of these two universities argued that ‘the analysis conducted by TEC as an organ of the New Zealand
Government would have much greater weight than any other’ (Williams, 2004, par. 34). This
argument was accepted by the Court (idem, par. 75):
… it can scarcely be doubted – and, to be fair, TEC did not strongly challenge the view –
that although undoubtedly attempts will be made by students, academic staff, research
funders and institutions around the world to compare the research excellence of New
Zealand TEOs with other universities and research institutions, any International
Comparison published by TEC – possessor of all the research data on New Zealand TEOs
and skilled and experienced interpreters of RAE – will have very much more clout than
any other. When a State agency such as TEC, experienced and skilled in comparing,
assessing and evaluating research, publishes a report comparing the research
achievements of New Zealand TEOs against their British counterparts, the result will be
accorded an official status, an imprimatur no other comparison could hope to approach.
Individual academics find themselves in a similar position when faced with their individual
quality grades in the PBRF. TEC (2002, par. 92) itself has warned ‘it should not be automatically
assumed that there would be a close correlation between an individual’s research score and their
overall level of achievement or academic standing’. It is also well-known that different assessment
systems often produce different outcomes at the individual level (see, for example, the discussion
between King, 2002, and Dalziel et al, 2002, on the same database of journal articles produced by
academic economists in New Zealand). Nevertheless, the unique status of TEC as a State agency
undertaking a comprehensive, systematic and authoritative assessment of research quality means that
individual grades awarded in the PBRF ‘have much more clout than any other’
.
This ought to impose a high duty of care on TEC, but this essay has argued that the individual
assessment part of the PBRF was not well designed. The chair of the Moderation Panel has
acknowledged that the personal assessments were not fair to some individuals, and section 1 also
noted a lack of transparency and a lack of respect for confidentiality in the PBRF. Section 2 explained
how the PBRF significantly departed from the quality standards set in the British research assessment
exercise, so that a large number of academics attaining national and international levels of research
excellence were categorised as merely ‘good’ or ‘very good’ in New Zealand. Section 3 made the
(universally accepted) criticism that there are very serious problems with ‘Grade R’ in the PBRF,
especially when applied to emerging researchers.
These problems are compounded by the fact that the PBRF is compulsory for eligible staff in
participating TEOs. The United Kingdom’s research assessment exercise is very sensitive to this
feature; it is the reason why the RAE does not report results to individuals as a matter of principle. Sir
Gareth Roberts (2003, par. 163) explicitly addressed this issue in his recent review of the RAE:
It should be a point of principle that we should not report on individuals’ performance on
the basis of an assessment which they cannot choose whether or not to enter and which
Page 7
New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1 Number 2, December 2004
considers a sample of their work which they themselves do not select. If a panel chooses
to use ‘researcher-level’ analysis to inform its judgement, we suggest that such analyses
should not in any circumstances be retained or disclosed. If it is not possible to avoid
retaining and disclosing such analyses, we suggest that they should not form a part of any
panel’s working methods. Research assessment should remain an assessment of
institutional research quality within a subject area, rather than a review of the
performance of individuals.
In contrast to the RAE, researchers in the PBRF were able to select four pieces of their work to be
given closest consideration by the panels, but otherwise Sir Gareth’s points are equally valid in New
Zealand. It is hard to think of any other sector where the government could contemplate requiring all
employees to submit their work to a central government agency to be given individual quality grades.
It is even harder to think of any central mechanism that could be reasonably fair, transparent and
confidential to all individuals in an activity as diverse as research in tertiary education organisations.
It is worth nothing that the reasoning behind Sir Gareth’s principle was recognised by the PBRF
Working Group when it first designed the fundamental elements of New Zealand’s system: ‘Subject
area or academic unit quality ratings would be more appropriate than individual ratings for use in
internal funding allocation and organisational restructuring, as they are at a higher level of aggregation
and are, therefore, more likely to be accurate’ (TEC, 2002, par. 93). Consequently, the question must
be asked: should the PBRF release individual assessments in any form? Arguably, it would be more
sensible for the PBRF to focus on its primary role of allocating research funds on the basis of
institutional research quality, rather than attempting (unsuccessfully) to provide fair and accurate
individual grades for all of the 8,013 researchers in the 2003 assessment.

Is the Performance Based Research Fund in the public interest?i
Emma Davies, David Craig &amp; Neville Robertson

The Performance Based Research Fund (PBRF) raises some interesting questions about how a nation
might best evaluate its research. In any democracy it is essential that there is accountability for taxpayers’
money in whichever sector it is spent. We welcome the intentions behind the PBRF to increase public
accountability of academics and improve the quality of our research. However, we are concerned that the
system risks reducing collaboration between institutions, creating narrow incentives and further
marginalising applied research.
Many outside academia may dismiss the ‘ivory tower’ as irrelevant to anything beyond itself. Beyond
the media, and a few policy journals and conferences, there are few natural forums for academics to engage
with policy analysts or politicians in policy debate. Think tanks and policy workshops are rare, or come with
highly charged agendas.
In our experience, academics are often fearful and scathing of the mass media. Few take the time to
cultivate constructive relationships with journalists. Any thoughtful society will want to maximise its
intellectual power and gear at least some of it towards improving the conditions in which its citizens live. A
thoughtful system of incentives would perhaps endeavour to facilitate better communication of research
findings in the public arena, rather than just improve the quality of public information about research
outputs. The system could have been worse in only rewarding academics that produce a litter of futile papers
(Butler, 2003). However, PBRF still risks creating narrow incentives.
Where are the incentives to publish research focused on local issues in New Zealand journals? What
will become of the role of the academic under The Education Act as ‘critic and conscience of society’? How
does the PBRF system value contribution to public debate on national issues? How many PBRF points does
a researcher receive for disseminating their findings through the mass media compared to writing his
thoughts in a ‘prestigious’ international journal read by a few academics? While it may be convenient to
dismiss such questions as irrelevant to any assessment of research quality, the PBRF system risks further
devaluing dissemination of research findings beyond the realms of mainly American and British peer-
reviewed academic journals.
While rewarding the winning institutions and penalising the losers, inequalities between institutions will
inevitably grow (Duncan, 2004). It may also become harder for institutions to collaborate to develop
precisely the sort of high quality research that the PBRF system intends to encourage. The real losers may
prove to be the New Zealand public.
How best to assess the quality of research, and increase our accountability to the taxpayer, is a
fascinating and complex question. The PBRF system does recognise that quantity of published papers in
peer-reviewed journals is not an adequate measure of quality but the membership of panels gives little hope
that broader criteria were considered. Ninety-three percent of PBRF panel membersii were academics based
in Universities or polytechnics, with academics comprising 100% members on six of the panels including
business and economics, education, medicine and public health (see Table 1). One of the exceptions to this
was the inclusion in the Health Panel of a drug company employee. This is not what we have in mind in
arguing for greater public accountability, and raises the broader issue of the increasing influence of business
interests over universities. Shouldn’t end-users of research have a more prominent place on panels? For
Page 1

example, where are the helping professions using the research produced by social scientists or the consumers
on the health panels? Had this representation been present, the results may have looked different.

Most Universities currently organise most of their departments according to disciplines e.g.,
Psychology, Economics, Sociology, Anthropology etc. However, the most exciting research of the 21st
Century is likely to be across disciplines not within them. So Psychologists may have more to learn from
Sociologists, Biologists and Philosophers for example, rather than from each other. Applied academics
from a range of disciplines also have a great deal to learn from policy analysts in the system: Central and
local government agencies, along with the third sector, increasingly employ people trained to postgraduate
and doctoral level, people for whom academic debates and on the ground practice are equally vital. However,
it is hard to see how the PBRF encourages interdisciplinary research, or indeed research conducted with
government, communities, practitioners or even colleagues.
The grading system does try to consider research in quality terms. It is based largely on academics’
choice of their four best recent research outputs, up to 50 other research outputs, ‘peer esteem’ and
‘contribution to the research environment’.. But in some ways it still favours a narrowly focussed research
and publish approach, well cloistered in the academy. In a number of disciplines, the cloistering is very
narrow indeed. A good way to publish in some scientific journals is to add on one new variable to existing
research, sometimes regardless of its importance or relevance to anything. If the public were to browse these
journals they might detect a trend towards understanding more and more details about less and less. In the
social sciences, the opposite dilemma applies: paradigmatic fragmentation merges with social complexity to
produce academic writing that needs attention to translation if it is to inform policy.
Page 2
New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1 Number 2, April 2005
In most disciplines, quantity of publications is being rewarded over quality, even where the system sets
out to incentivise publication in the ‘best’ journals. Some disciplines rely heavily on a computerised
international hierarchy of journals to assess research quality. This hierarchy is partly based on the rejection
rate of journal articles, such that journals that reject proportionally more articles are higher up the hierarchy.
This simplistic numbers game does not necessarily reflect the quality of research.
Journals that are geared towards practitioners do not tend to rate as highly in the international hierarchy
of journals. In New Zealand, this is exacerbated by the explicit PBRF regard for international over local
publication. We are quick to engage in the rhetoric of a ‘knowledge society’ and the use of ‘evidence-based
practice’ in the human services. We are slower to reward research that has relevance in the real world.
PBRF risks endowing greater value to 10 academics in the USA reading and filing one of our papers, than
100 New Zealanders reading it and doing something useful with the findings.
Another way of assessing research quality in some disciplines is the Citation Index which records how
many other academics have referred to a research paper. Ironically this frequency of citation is known as the
‘impact factor’ despite its having no relationship to whether the research actually had any impact on anything
other than another academic. Despite comments in prestigious journals indicating the contrary (Butler,
2002), publication in a high-impact journal such as Nature, does not guarantee high ‘impact’.
Many citations point out biases, poor methodology or faulty logic. Yet under the ‘impact factor’ system
each such critique enhances the perceived ‘quality’ of the researcher. To use an extreme example, a
colleague has just published a book on schizophrenia that includes a chapter on psychiatry and the holocaust
(Read, Mosher &amp; Bentall, 2004). Every reference to the eugenicists, under our current obsession with
citations, could enhance the academic reputation of those whose published works justified the murder of
300,000 mental patients. A more mundane example is a 1988 paper, in the highly prestigious journal Nature,
announcing the ‘discovery’ of a specific locus on a specific chromosome for susceptibility to schizophrenia.
Numerous rebuttals of this study have been published, the first within a record-breaking 24 hours.
Nevertheless, it has been cited 407 times (Sherrington et al., 1988). No sorry. Make that 408iii
.
While not without its own characteristics (some virtuous), our PBRF system is already producing results
not dissimilar to the results of a system introduced into Britain years ago. British colleagues of ours, who are
eminent scientists, describe the absurdity of Universities literally buying the ‘best’ from one another in the
same way as soccer teams compete in the transfer market. One colleague laughed as he explained to us how
many stunning offers he has had from other Universities. While teams move up and down the league table
as a result, and the winning managers may celebrate in the media, the overall quality of national play is not
improved. Indeed it may well be diminished if the teams are disrupted. In our opinion, New Zealand can ill
afford to set institution against institution in our efforts to produce high quality research.
Some Universities have already set out to capitalise on the PBRF league tables through their marketing
machines. Prospective students and their parents may look to these league tables to ascertain where it is best
to do a Bachelors degree. However, as any academic in the belly of the beast will tell you, perception of
excellence can be a long way from reality. And, from students’ perspective, better teaching may deliver
more than success defined in terms of academic publications.
In each university, as in any other workplace, there is a range of abilities. Staff have strengths and
weaknesses. Some A grade researchers, however we choose to define them, may be poor teachers. Potential
students would be better off asking to see teaching evaluations by current students than looking at league
tables of PBRF research quality. Of course our teaching must be research-based. But if each of us taught
Page 3
New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1 Number 2, April 2005
just on the basis of our own research many of our courses would be rather narrow. We need to understand
and teach the range of research pertinent to degrees.
Increasingly, collegiality both within departments, and across institutional and international borders is
vital to academics getting to the kinds of broadened understandings and wider engagements they require, if
they are to maximise their unique contribution bases. In our opinion, PBRF needs us to pay more attention
to incentivising collegiality, whether through treating co-publishing as of equal merit, or rewarding
publications done with graduate students or junior staff. Currently, however, achieve an A grade, academics
usually need to prioritise publication in prestigious journals above supporting their junior colleagues.
Teaching undergraduate students can become an irritating distraction. Post-graduate students are often only
useful if they conduct research that assists the publication record of the aspiring academic. And guess who
picks up the majority of the under-graduate teaching and administration that the A graders may not want to
do? It is often the youngest academics, the future researchers of this country. These younger people are left
with little time to engage in thoughtful discussions about real issues, as they are too busy with the more
mundane aspects of academic life. This decreases the likelihood that they can produce good quality
research.
Does the public really want a system to determine accountability of researchers that relies so heavily on
the views of academics? As applied researchers, we are probably biased. However we do wonder whether a
more balanced system of accountability might also emphasise potential and actual benefits for our
communities. For example, one of us is co-producing a research-based issues guide for community groups
with a public servant. The others have conducted local research that has helped to inform local practice in the
human services. Under the PBRF system of incentives, these would not be important.
In the UK, the early forms of their system were greatly modified in the light of experience and feedback.
PBRF is in the early stages of development. It is not too late to change direction. Public accountability
means being accountable to the public not just to one another.

Essay Review
Jane Kelsey
At the Crossroads: Three Essays
(Wellington, Bridget Williams Books, 2002), ISBN 1877 242918; $34.95
Brian Easton
Students and the general public have found invaluable the sequence of books Jane Kelsey has produced
on contemporary New Zealand society and governance, beginning with a study of how the Labour
Government dealt with Treaty issues, working through the New Zealand experiment and now a couple on
New Zealand in a globalised world, the latest of which is three essays in At the Crossroads (although,
curiously, the cover shows a signpost at Bluff, the end of the country). Reviews of her books usually go to
the extremes of the paean or condemnation. But the sequence of works indicates that Kelsey is in a dialogue
with herself, and with others. What she most needs, and I hope welcomes, is the tough but sympathetic
critique which this review attempts to provide.
Kelsey defines globalisation as ‘global capitalism’ not very differently from the London Economist.
However this is a label – an outcome, not an analysis of the process. Without such analysis, any description
of globalisation can only be a series of criticisms or commendations.
How the capitalist system survives is one of life’s great mysteries: it hardly seems a creation of the
rationality that pervaded Western intellectual thought 200 years ago; many of its principles seem unethical;
there are books and books which list its faults; terrible things happen in its name. For 150 years there have
been predictions of its imminent demise. And yet - and yet, capitalism survives.
It is this mystery which forms the background to Kelsey’s book. The title of the opening essay ‘The
Wobbly Bicycle: Globalisation on the Precipice’ echoes Supachai Panitchpaki, the next director of the
WTO, likening of global capitalism to a ‘wobbly bicycle’. To which a citizen of Christchurch might
comment that bicycles are wobbly, but they prove very effective means of transport and crash only very
rarely.
Kelsey says ‘continued globalisation cannot be taken for granted, and retreat is a distinct possibility.’
She lists the opposition to globalisation and reports various critics. At the heart of her thesis is ‘the
globalisation agenda operates on the fallacy that the unfettered concentration of wealth and power can
continue indefinitely, irrespective of its economic, social cultural and political fallout – and that people, and
the governments that depend on those people for their legitimacy, will continue to acquiesce in that
outcome.’ The first essay lists these contradictions.
Well yes, but could not this largely have been said 150 odd years ago? Was not the poverty, the
destruction of traditional ways of life, the environmental degradation greater then? Did not the Western
world almost come to its knees in 1848 (and what about the terrible slump of the early 1930s)? Yet the
bicycle wobbles on. Of course the next fall may be final – the rider not just grazing a knee and remounting,
but breaking something and lying there on the road. That has been the critics’ promise for 150 years: one
day they may get it right.
If I had to bet on what is different this time, I would do so by extending Marx’s notion of the changing
role of money. He suggested that initially it was to intermediate between the exchange of two commodities.
Page 1
New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1 Number 2, April 2005
As he put it: C→M→C&#39;
. Then the making of money became the purpose of the exercise and the commodity
a means of doing so, reversing the roles: M→C→M&#39;. Nowadays the making of money seems to have
bypassed production, so it is M→FP→M&#39;, when FP is financial paper. Both Long Term Capital
Management and Enron are examples of firms with only the barest connection with the production process.
Their collapse may presage the gotterdammerung of this phase of capitalism. But the phoenix which rises is
likely to be another form of capitalism, albeit (I infer Kelsey hopes) one which is more nation and human
focussed.
Where the first essay misses out, is an account of why the bike has been so successful, and what is
different this time. A series of criticisms, no matter how powerful, is not a critique. As much as Karl Marx
got it wrong (and his followers misrepresented him) he had a compelling theory of how the inconsistencies
internal to capitalism would bring it down. Because he has an analysis he does not have to rely on
metaphors, such as wobbly bicycles.
With hindsight there were two major weakness in his theory. He underestimated the capacity of
capitalism to adapt to social and political pressures, for today’s capitalism is very different from that of the
nineteenth century. And he failed to recognise the impact of cumulating technological change. Although we
think of capitalism being about profits, it actually seems driven by technological opportunities. It is as if the
capitalist bike is wobbling on a long downhill run generated by innovations. If ever they cease, then so
might capitalism.
This failure to look deeply at the fundamentals of capitalism also mars the second essay, ‘The Third
Way - The Road to Nowhere’. Kelsey has the gravest reservations as to the usefulness of the Third Way
strategy, which often seems little more than a grab-bag of half-thought through responses to poorly
understood problems. Even Tony Blair joked that the German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder ‘was saying to
me ... I haven&#39;t found the first two ways yet, so you tell me where the third one is.’ No wonder it seems a
dying fashion.
Nevertheless its origins are fascinating and its development instructive. The story can be personalised
in Anthony Giddens, who as a young sociologist, was deeply committed to a political economy paradigm
which had evolved out of Marx, in which class was inextricably intertwined with capitalist development.
Over the years he became increasingly disillusioned, because the reformulation did not tie into the world he
saw developing. Giddens’ ‘Third Way’ may have an analysis as rich and as complex as his earlier writing,
but it is yet to see the light of day, and thus far its foundations appear superficial and opportunistic.
Kelsey argues that the Third Way is not relevant to New Zealand, and decries the colonial mentality
which adopts uncritically the latest overseas fashion. She rightly points out that the neo-liberals’ revolution
suppressed alternative viewpoints, which has made the development of critiques and alternatives extremely
difficult. (As a reviewer remarked, for Isaiah Berlin ‘the central paradox of modern thinking about liberty is
this: that it is often those most attached to freedom as a political value who ended up supporting ideas or
measures that reduced its sphere or sought to extinguish it.’) Moreover, many of the measures they took will
persist, not only because rogernomes dug themselves into positions of influence, but because the structural
changes weakened the ability to generate alternatives. (It is not accidental that the universities, the
traditional critical base, are far less effective today than they were three decades ago, despite being charged
with being a ‘critic and conscience of society’.)
Page 2
New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1 Number 2, April 2005
So the third essay, ‘Taking the High Road - a Requiem for TINA’
, turns to the possible alternatives to
capitalism and the Third Way. But the earlier failure to provide a serious critique of modern capitalism now
becomes a severe liability, for Kelsey’s alternative is not unlike the Third Way, a list of things that could be
done without any integrating coherence except her passion for social justice. Kelsey acknowledges as much
when she writes ‘such a transformation may seem unrealistic in the New Zealand of today. There is no
alternative vision to inspire us towards a people style of nationbuilding.’ While they are more detailed than
in her earlier works, their fundamental weakness is they do not centre around the critical issue: how is New
Zealand to engage with the rest of the world? The answer in part depends upon what the rest of the world is
like: presumably the issue is how to design an engagement which is robust and flexible to the range of
possibilities. That requires a deeper analysis about the nature of the modern world than is here.
If this review is tough, it is not so to discourage potential readers. Although it should not be used it as a
primary source for many of its statements are less authoritative or reliable than they appear (unlike her earlier
works there are no copious citations to check them), At the Crossroads should be read as the part of the
debate about our – New Zealand and the world’s – future. That is why this review is a critical engagement.
Some readers may be deterred by the price of $34.95, which is high for 137 pages. But that reflects the
limited market in New Zealand. There are few venues for essays of 10,000 plus words, yet we need more of
them, and should be willing to pay the price. One hopes this will be the first of a series of such publications,
which explore the issues that Kelsey raises, at both a deeper and wider level.

This book is the result of a research project gathering data from 959 VUW students aged over 40 using
questionnaires, and 9 follow up studies with specific groups.
There is a summary of the questionnaire results. These are not too surprising. The group is mostly
female, about half are under 50 years of age, more likely to be taking postgraduate qualifications than the
student body as a whole, most study part-time, most are in high income brackets.
Some of the follow up studies will be of great interest to those teaching in specific disciplines: Maori
studies, Nursing, Teaching, Management studies.
This book also highlights some of the barriers to University education faced by older students. These
can include deficits from the student’s point of view:
• Sometimes little study experience, i.e. early school leavers.
• Difficult issues juggling time; the work-home-study balance.
Some issues are more related to the institution:
• A culture which may not welcome older students.
• High financial commitments.
• Courses that don’t meet continuing professional development needs.
It also looks at the good experiences, sometimes far exceeding expectations. These include high
academic success rates, a strong sense of personal achievement and, for some students, professional
advancement.
Many of both the negatives and the positives will be true for other student groups as well as for these
older students. Some of the students’ reflections were no doubt shaped by particular and unusual
circumstances. On the whole they reflected the learning experiences of highly motivated students.
This is a timely study as universities become more aware of a change in the students’ demographic
attributes. In 2000, 63% of new entrants were older students who had left school and then return to
study(New Zealand. Ministry of Education, 2000). Students aged 40 and over now represent 22% of all
students, up from 16% in 1994 (New Zealand. Ministry of Education, 2003).
The concluding chapter highlights some needs: more academic support for mature students, delivery of
administrative and study support services, greater flexibility of office hours. They criticise a TEAC proposal
to remove the open entry provision for students 21 years and above (New Zealand. Tertiary Education
Page 1
New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1 Number 2, April 2005
Advisory Commission, 2001).
The study does not address the perspectives of academic staff teaching these students. Nor does it fully
evaluate the impact of mature students on the University more generally. Maori mature students, for
instance, are sometimes expected to act as advisers to younger students. This area could well be developed
further.
This is a well-written account of useful research. The quotations using the students’ own words provide
real stories to enhance the text. It gives a good picture of student experiences of University life using the
mature insights of an extraordinary body of students.

‘This book is a must-read for those who populate universities and for anyone who wishes
to understand how the aim of higher education—indeed the very philosophy underpinning
university life itself—seems to be changing across the globe.’ So pronounces Kyongsoo Lho
on the jacket of Welcome to the Campus of Struggle. Portentous, fittingly for a title so
redolent of a luta continua. But, it turns out (xi), David Cohen got the phrase from a hand-
painted sign outside the University of Indonesia in Jakarta, wryly abbreviated from ‘Welcome
to the Campus of Struggle of the New Order’ in the last days of Suharto in 1998.
Cohen’s book is a collection of his journalism about universities, mostly first published
in the Chronicle of Higher Education or the Guardian. Wellington-based, Cohen also
includes the occasional article from the Listener or North and South. For the Chronicle he
covers the South Seas (xii), so that many of his pieces have a regional relevance for New
Zealand.
Change is a patchily sustained theme. At Lincoln University, Cohen says in ‘Switching
from Sheep to Computers in New Zealand’ (143-6), there was in 2000 an agricultural science
student called John Shearer (sic). This man thought Michael Cullen’s reinvigorated higher
education system was coming too late for him, and intended to go to America or England for
further study. Other pieces raise questions, but conclusions about change are hard to draw. Is
New Zealand becoming more like America? John Dybvig was teaching the American accent
to students at Unitec in 2001 (12-15). Where will genetic engineering lead? Who knows?
But Cohen reported the destruction of Margaret J. Gilpin’s potato plants in Christchurch in
2002 (53-6), done (if the cops were right) by people associated with the Wild Greens.
A kind of conversation often called the ‘news agenda’ drives daily paper, radio and TV
news. It has a slower-moving counterpart, too, on which Cohen has drawn. A journalist
covering New Zealand universities could hardly not write about Karl Popper, and so Cohen
did in 2002 (167-72), with the right mention of David Edmonds’ and John Eidinow’s
Wittgenstein’s Poker (2001). And someone had to ask if the Alinghi syndicate in 2003 had
better academics on board (from Lausanne) than Team New Zealand: ‘its mast didn’t snap
like a 70-foot carbon-fiber matchstick’ (165). For another obligatory subject, Bryan Gould at
the University of Waikato (cruelly, ‘an insignificant post-secondary institution’), Cohen has
dug out a piece from 1996, which ended by quoting the man: ‘I don’t see myself as having
been a failure.’
New Zealand is not all. There is a farrago from 2002 about ‘Modern Oxford’ (38-46):
Laura Spence, the Said Business School, the Begbroke Business and Science Park, American

exchanges. Another piece reports on conferences about Bob Dylan and concludes tiredly
(quoting Lawrence Wilde), ‘Dylan most certainly is a legitimate subject for academics to be
studying’. Other low points include articles about exam howlers (110-12) and the Philosophy
and Literature bad writing contest (113-15).
Journalists are good at reporting things which have happened and bad at guessing the
future: so that ‘Is Hong Kong’s Boom in Distance Education a Sign of What’s to Come?’
(152-5), published in July 2000 before the tech wreck, now looks ill-judged. But there are
other reports from many places: depressing, as on the decline of public universities in
Argentina (57-9); intriguing, as on multimedia education at Ewha Womans University in
Seoul (19-23); and occasionally uplifting, as on student journalism and broadcasting at the
University of the South Pacific in Suva (9-11). This book is good on the whole, and
‘excellent in parts’.

In one of the more famous opening lines of a novel, L.P. Hartley’s The Go-Between has
it that ‘The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there’. Tom Scott amends this
statement for local usage. Talking about his documentary on David Lange – Reluctant
Revolutionary – he said should a New Zealander not alive in those times suddenly be
transported back to pre-1984 days the ‘past wouldn’t be a foreign country so much as a
different planet’. When he explained to TVNZ’s sales and marketing department that the
documentary was on Lange he was met with the question: “who’s he?” Scott reports that
perhaps 2 million New Zealanders have been born since Lange’s fourth Labour government.
This translates into a serious challenge for tertiary educators. These days we are confronted
with students that have no memory of key moments in New Zealand and world history, no
memory of the Cold War, of Left opposition, no memory of alternatives. 1984 is a
momentous date. When a Stage One social policy tutor at our institution enquired of its
significance he faced a room full of blank stares. Eventually a student’s hand went up: ‘That
was the year I was born’, he proudly replied.
How gratifying, then, to have a book that recovers the past from this Orwellian memory
hole, that charts the Rogernomics revolution, New Zealand’s third way, and so much more
besides. Duncan offers a critical analysis of the state and law and of how they frame human
interaction in our nation. This is a comparative exercise. The political ideas that inform social
policy are illuminated through examinations of ideal-type (European) political philosophies
and their application in the New Zealand context. As Duncan explains at the close: ‘I have set
out to explain the basic political ideas that have mattered most to New Zealand, to explore
their philosophical origins, and to use historical situations and events as examples of their
significance’ (p.282). This aim is achieved. Society and Politics is a refreshing antidote to
customary works on social policy. They have a tendency to be thinly descriptive, to deal with
upholstery rather than architecture. Here we have a theoretically-informed piece of critical
analysis that purposely casts its net beyond policy to consider society and politics. So
alongside the familiar question: what is social policy? The author also tackles: what is
ideology? What are rights? What is liberalism? What is socialism? What is the welfare state?
In consequence it will prove to be a useful addition to the reading lists of Social Policy,
Sociology, Political Studies and History lecturers, and there is much to interest the general
reader as well.
The author makes no attempt to push a party line. ‘It is up to you, the reader, to consider
these diverse political traditions, each in its own right, and to discover how they inform or
challenge your own personal values’ he says (p. 9). Not that this position should be confused

with a suspension of critical faculties. Duncan dismisses the enduring myths of New Zealand
as social laboratory, as racially harmonious paradise and as class-free utopia. He also notes
the ‘great failings of the nation-building politics of the years of social democracy: it was a
nation created in the image primarily of the white male of settler stock, with white women as
supporting cast, and Maori a fondly remembered, but defeated, warrior race’ (p.277). The
social democratic settlement was ended by neo-liberalism. While the new-found institutional
transparency is praised, the ‘disastrous consequences’ of neo-liberalism with its ‘bullying and
narrow-minded anti-intellectualism’ are also highlighted (p. 278). Nor does the book lack
honesty of other sorts. In a section devoted to the problems of ethnic identity he writes, ‘I can
only conclude that there is no satisfactory label for my ethnic group’ (p. 176).
An historical sensibility suffuses this work. Students are made aware of how the past
informs the present. Material is presented clearly and concisely, and there are suggestions for
further reading at the end of each chapter. The major ideologies of liberalism and socialism
and their later inflections are detailed, as are patriarchal and colonial legacies in this country,
and how racism and sexism are perpetuated or alleviated by social policy. In sum, it is a
timely and able publication. Recommended.
