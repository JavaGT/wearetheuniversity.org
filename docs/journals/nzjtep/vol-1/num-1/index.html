We in the education sector appear to be fond of saying “education is in crisis”. For the Association of University Staff (AUS) it is that “the universities are in crisis”. Fond isn’t quite the right word. From our point of view, the anguish is genuine. Our experience is that of constant stumbling from one set of constraints to another, from one management fad (at either institutional or national level) to the next, from one inevitable government review to another each time governments change. We know how few resources we make do with compared to similar institutions around the world and it often seems miraculous that universities in New Zealand are still held in high regard by far richer institutions (40% less than in the case of Australia alone). Of course, from the point of view of university staff, it is not a miracle at all: it is just bloody hard work, achieved despite the constant change in ground rules. Though stamina is waning, the effort continues because staff, by and large, remain dedicated to what universities do and what they stand for.
Yet the importance of tertiary education to society and the economy has become a cross-party, almost universal, article of faith. Higher levels of education are accepted as critical to economic success; relevant research is a fundamental driver of economic development. Education contributes to “nation building” and a more adaptable and tolerant society. Yet the gap between resources provided and escalating expectations never seems to close. Institutions are resourced to run on the brink of insolvency. Those who work in New Zealand’s tertiary institutions, and particularly the universities, find the divergence between rhetoric and reality both puzzling and infuriating.
There are two ways to react to this rhetoric gap. One is to take political and industrial action. The other is to build public, political – and our own – knowledge of what tertiary education is about, its value to society, the advantages and pitfalls of different policy options, the effects of educational, management and political choices.
AUS is doing both. Urgency and long neglect dictate the first. The need for healthier public knowledge of what universities do, and for informed debate on the lessons of past policies and sensible options for the future, dictate the second.
This e-journal has been launched to contribute to this knowledge and debate. We hope that AUS members, other staff in the tertiary sector, and interested people from outside the sector, will contribute and make this a lively and influential forum on the future of New Zealand’s tertiary education. You are cordially invited to do so.
I would like to thank Neville Blampied for offering his expertise, judgement, and (yet again) his energy in taking on the role of Executive Editor of this journal. Thanks also to the team behind Neville. But acknowledgement is also due to those who originally conceived of an AUS e-journal and took the first steps towards making it a reality: Matthew Fitzsimons, Michael Peters and Paul McKechnie. Mention should also be made of George Baxter and Adrienne Paranihi, who generously provided their technical advice in the early stages of the journal’s development. May the reality bear fruit in thriving public tertiary education in New Zealand.

Abstract
Pouvoir et Savoir:
The Tertiary Education Strategy and the will to know1
Dr. Grant Duncan
School of Social and Cultural Studies Massey University Albany
This paper is a critical analysis of the rhetoric and epistemology of the government’s recent Tertiary Education Strategy 2002-7 (TES), a document intended to guide the reform of universities in the coming years. It examines the TES in terms of a shift in the political economy of knowledge towards ‘perfor- mativity’ (as described by Lyotard), and considers in particular the position of the humanities within the changing institutional values of the University. This will also encompass a discussion of the emerging performance-based funding models with which university staff are currently grappling, and the prospects for academic freedom.
Introduction
I have chosen to borrow from the French for my title, partly to recognize the fact that French thinkers have had an influence on this paper, and partly because the English language does not allow for the same dual usage of infinitive verb and noun.2 My theme thus concerns the mutuality of knowledge and power, as well as the dual nature of knowl- edge as an orientation towards an object and as a capability to achieve objectives; but this theme is explored in a very practical and contemporary setting. It concerns the direct governmental interest in ‘knowledge’, and specifically the theory of knowledge underlying the Tertiary Education Strategy 2002-7 as promulgated by the Labour-led government early in 2002. This will lead to some reflection on the position of the University as an institution in its contemporary context, and specifically the critical juncture at which the disciplines of the humanities now find themselves, as these disciplines reflect most clearly upon the present trajectory of the University that has ‘housed’ them. But, first, I will make some general comments on the correlative constitution of knowledge and power.
Many contemporary debates suggest that it is no longer credible to uphold unconditionally the ideal of a body of knowledge that is impartial and disinterested, especially as this is vested in the institution of the University. The critiques of such epistemic models come from a number of angles. The cultural canons enshrined within University scholarship and curricula are now firmly linked – historically and thematically – to the project of imperialism and the marginalisation of indigenous cultures. The university itself has become the site of often bitter struggles over affirma- tive action, meritocracy, cultural diversity and equality of opportunity. In the midst of these struggles, traditional cur- ricula and career-promotion criteria have both been challenged. The very idea of an impartial and disinterested pursuit of truth has been questioned. The claim to a higher truth-status on the basis of impartiality (rational or empirical) can now be read as a strategic move within a specified regime of power.
These critiques of regimes of truth and their institutional forms have tended to arise from such quarters as social movements for equal rights and their associated critical social and political theories. Nonetheless, it has still been pos- sible to profess an unconditional commitment to assert ‘the truth’ as a fundamental tenet of academic freedom.
This [“modern”] university claims and ought to be granted in principle, besides what is called academic freedom, an unconditional freedom to question and to assert, or even, going still further, the right to say publicly all that is required by research, knowledge, and thought concerning the truth.... The university professes the truth, and that is its profession.... No doubt the status of and the changes to the value of truth can be discussed ad infinitum.... But these are discussed, precisely, in the University and in departments that belong to the Humanities (Derrida, 2001, p. 24).
The present analysis of the Tertiary Education Strategy, however, shows that governmental strategy may now be lending its own form of unconditional (sovereign) authority to the erosion of the primacy of the ‘profession of truth’ as the underlying purpose of the University. It suggests that ‘truth’ (as a guiding, though disputed, criterion of proof and public discourse) has been superceded by ‘performance’, in the senses of productivity, effectiveness or efficiency. The
Page 1

goal of knowledge ‘production’ becomes the discovery of technical powers to achieve things (pouvoir) rather than the discovery of laws that may be generally valid or true.
This change in the guiding criteria of knowledge production involves further change in the kinds of discursive forms that the University is required to issue. At this point, then, it is useful to clarify the difference between a denotative and a performative statement. Denotative statements are the typical form of propositions of or about ‘the truth’. They tend to take the form ‘A is the case’ – a proposition or hypothesis the truth, validity or probability of which may be tested and debated. Although the perceived authority of the person uttering the statement does influence our acceptance of it, the ultimate test of its validity resides within its apparent conformance either with empirical fact or with rationally deduced principles.
A performative statement, on the other hand, is one that, in its very utterance, makes something happen. A good example is the chairperson of a committee saying, ‘I declare the meeting closed’. In this case, the validity of the state- ment depends almost entirely on the power and authority of the person uttering it, and on the context or timing of its utterance. The purpose, moreover, is not to claim that something is true, but to make something occur. It is intended to have a practical effect. Generalising this form of language game, Lyotard (1984) identifies a modern functionalist rule of social and institutional systems that he terms ‘performativity’: ‘...the optimization of the global relationship between input and output’ (p. 11).
The move towards ‘performativity’ as the leading criterion of validity has already been keenly analysed by Lyotard (1984). It has meant that the autonomy of the university as a repository of knowledge, a knowledge underpinning ide- als that would lead a national project of emancipation, is approaching an end.
The production of proof, which is in principle only part of an argumentation process designed to win agreement from the addressees of scientific messages, thus falls under the control of another language game, in which the goal is no longer truth, but performativity – that is, the best possible input/output equation. The State and/or company must abandon the idealist and humanist narratives of legitimation in order to justify the new goal: in the discourse of today’s financial backers of research, the only credible goal is power. Scientists, technicians, and instruments are purchased not to find truth, but to augment power (Lyotard, 1984, p. 46).
First published in French in 1979, these words will be seen to be prophetic in the context of the New Zealand Government’s Tertiary Education Strategy (TES) for the years 2002-7.
The Tertiary Education Strategy
So, what is the Tertiary Education Strategy? It was issued by the government in early 2002 as a key guiding docu- ment within the overall ‘reform’ of tertiary education being undertaken at that time. It is intended to set broad goals and priorities for tertiary-education institutions and for the Tertiary Education Commission. As a document, it sets out a very broad vision and set of goals for the whole tertiary education sector, taking in a very wide range of activities from foundation skills through to advanced research. Universities are conceived of as just one set of organisations within this wider ‘sector’, though their specific roles are given occasional acknowledgement.
This Strategy supports the Government’s Growth and Innovation Framework, and takes a broad view of New Zealand’s development, framed within this section around the six national goals of:
• economic transformation;
• social development;
• Maori development;
• environmental sustainability;
• infrastructural development; and • innovation.
The Strategy outlines how the tertiary education system will help give effect to the Government’s vision and goals (TES, p. 10).
Universities are thus positioned as organizations that will somehow help to achieve governmental objectives, or

<p>New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1, June 2004
‘national goals’. Befitting of this nation-building political vision, the TES gives a brief ‘state-of-the-nation’ overview, one that could have been written for a tourist brochure or an investment prospectus.
New Zealand has a low population density, so that large parts of the country remain dominated by na- tive vegetation. This enables New Zealanders to enjoy a lifestyle that is the envy of many countries. Importantly, the comparative advantages that make this landmass a wonderful place to grow plants and animals also combine, with our low population density, to make this country a wonderful place in which to live, and in which to holiday (TES, p. 10).
But the true purpose of this anodyne portrait of New Zealand as ‘a fine place to live and grow’ is to introduce an underlying urgency for economic growth, specifically based upon ‘knowledge’. This so-called ‘knowledge economy’ is presented in the TES under the broader term ‘knowledge society’ in order to make social, cultural and environmental affairs thinkable within its compass. It is argued that, if New Zealanders wish to sustain or to improve on their standard of living, they will have to diversify their economy to encompass more products that ‘add value’ based upon more ‘information’, rather than continue to rely upon unprocessed commodities that are more vulnerable to the vagaries of world markets. The word information is glossed in terms such as ‘sophistication’, ‘image’ and ‘performance’, and the application of knowledge to existing or to innovative production is seen as the key to success. The TES is replete with uses of the word knowledge, and I would like to isolate these usages in order to elucidate the theory of knowledge that is being deployed here. To summarise in advance, though, the most self-evident idea of knowledge deployed in the TES is the commodity form. The creation and use of knowledge is seen to be the factor of production that will af- ford the nation greater wealth, a better society and a cleaner environment. Knowledge can be produced as employable skills, and it can be sold in the form of an intangible, performance-related ‘value’ added to economic goods. Knowl- edge must therefore be applied to knowledge itself, in order to understand its economic role more thoroughly, and in order to shape more effectively those institutional arrangements responsible for its production and distribution.
Knowledge has always been applied to knowledge in the history of western thought, however. That is, epistemol- ogy has always been at the roots of philosophy ever since ancient Greek times when thinkers asked, for example, how one may distinguish between truth and mere opinion, and whether we can know anything that is eternally true for all rational beings. So, more needs to be said about what has changed here. We need to uncover the basic epistemic shift of which the present politically-dominant discourse is a symptom. But, first, we must examine aspects of the language of the TES. What follows, it should be noted, analyses the rhetoric of the TES, somewhat devoid of context. I will give a reading that supposes that the TES is to be taken literally, and some of the implications of this may be therefore exag- gerated when compared with likely practical results. Later parts of this paper will describe some of this context.
The strategic, visionary ‘will’
By definition, a strategic plan is a forward-looking document, and thus it uses, for practical as well as rhetorical purposes, the future tense. The TES is no exception to this, and there are only a few passing references to the history of the University. These references are largely embedded in sub-clauses, as reassuring qualifications to the relentless futurity that this document proposes. The TES tends to refer to the ‘tertiary education system’ as a whole, moreover, with little specific reference to diverse institutional types; and it frequently makes bold and significant assertions about our future.
By 2007, the quality of learning and research outcomes from our tertiary education system will have sig- nificantly improved. The financial viability, strategic capacity, leadership and international orientation of our tertiary education system will be stronger (TES, p. 21).
The use of the future tense here demands some interpretation. This is the ‘will’ of a person (an unnamed person, in this case, but perhaps impersonally the political will of ‘Government’) envisaging a desired state-of-affairs-to-be. It could easily blend into the ‘will’ of prediction, or of necessity, or even that of compulsion (given that this is the will of the sovereign expressing itself), but it is apparently intended to be a ‘visionary’ usage of the future tense. Thus, it is envisaged that the universities ‘will’ take on a certain appearance or function in future, according to its contribution to government’s stated ‘national goals’. It is perhaps ominous for some to read a document that is signed by a Cabinet Minister telling us what their university ‘will’ be like and how its decision-makers ‘will’ behave. Does this somehow compromise the supposed autonomy of the University, one of its defining values?
Page 3</p>
<p>New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1, June 2004
As suggested above, the past, the ‘traditional university’, is alluded to only as a qualifying or mitigating consider- ation – perhaps to reassure the reader that a future in which things ‘will’ change in line with governmental objectives would not lose sight altogether of things of enduring value, such as institutional autonomy.
Although the values of the traditional university will continue to be relevant, all providers that seek pub- lic funds, and particularly those that manage and govern significant infrastructural investment by the Crown, will be required to demonstrate both strategic capacity and alignment with national goals if their activities are to continue to be supported by the public purse (TES, pp. 21-22).
Nonetheless, this ‘tradition’ seems destined for change:
There will ... be an increasing incidence of convergent or synergistic research that breaks down the tra- ditional barriers between the arts and sciences (TES, p. 49).
Academics in the arts and sciences may want to take note of this now, because this ‘convergent or synergistic re- search’ is apparently what they ‘will’ be doing more of in future, if they are not doing it already. It would also seem advisable to read about the objectives of the Government of the day in order to ensure that one’s research and scholar- ship are aligned with those.
The uses of ‘knowledge’
The basic theory of knowledge applied within the TES is not really explicitly stated or critically analysed, but is nonetheless fairly easy to see. Knowledge is essentially a commodity, or a factor of production that ‘adds value’ to commodities, including labour. It is also a socially useful political tool for the effective achievement of governmental goals. Hence we find passages in the TES such as:
The world’s economy is undergoing significant change, with an increasing emphasis on the creation and application of knowledge as the foundation for prosperity and social inclusion. For New Zealand, the development of a prosperous and confident knowledge society must build on this nation’s uniqueness and strengths. To create, market and sell high value products and services will require a strong focus on the global marketplace, and sophisticated new skills and knowledge (TES, p.10).
Underlying globalisation and technological change places an importance on new knowledge and skills, and their application. The countries that retain or achieve first-world living standards will be those that respond proactively to these trends. For New Zealand, there are new opportunities for achieving prosper- ity by applying our skills and knowledge on the increasingly accessible global stage (TES, p.11).
... research and innovation are key drivers of modern economies ... the broader application of new knowl- edge will enable the achievement of social, environmental and infrastructural goals (TES, p. 16).
The underlying ‘commodity’ theory of knowledge will predictably have a direct effect on how one conceives of and designs the ideal University. As the past ideal of the ‘impartial, disinterested pursuit of truth’ may have once been a guiding institutional principle, the TES now substitutes a ‘political-economic value-added’ vision. Whereas, in earlier times, the tradition of a nation’s literary and linguistic heritage, and the development of ‘cultured’ persons may have been definitive of the University’s core disciplines, it now appears that the University’s role is to help maximise wealth and minimise social and environmental risks. There can be no doubt that University teaching and research have always contributed, directly or indirectly, to such goals, but they have traditionally not been definitive of the institutional ‘mis- sion’ or purpose of the University.
If one were to take the TES literally, then, one may discern a shift in emphasis from ‘knowledge liberates’ (or, the liberal-democratic ‘freedom to know’) to ‘knowledge adds value’ (including the values of citizenship, quality of life, and governmental nation-building). It is important to note that this shift is recognisable globally, and is not an isolated ‘New Zealand experiment’. Reading the UN’s Human Development Report 2001, for example, helps to place this kind of thinking in a global context. There is the same emphasis on research for technological development, the imperative for universities to be ‘connected’ with industry, and for education to be focused on the production of skills.
To give another, very broad-brush characterisation of the apparent shift in thought about knowledge that is implied Page 4</p>
<p>New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1, June 2004
here, one might begin by hazarding a generalisation that the modern project of the University, especially over the course of the twentieth century, was about more than just knowledge for its emancipatory or inherent value. Knowl- edge was considered ‘true’ insofar as it was gained ‘impartially’, or precisely because it was of no direct use to the ‘partial’ or predetermined purposes of political and economic strategies. The revelation of the structure and/or function of underlying systems was a major preoccupation, albeit one that has been critically challenged by postmodern and poststructural theory. The knowing subject, embedded within any such system, is reflexively problematised as well, and is seen in relation to a dynamic ‘unknown’, or unconscious, that shapes the evolution and understanding of the system itself.
By contrast, the commodity theory of knowledge emphasises its performative value, and therefore views knowledge as a ‘bank’ of ideas that may or may not be technically useful. Knowledge is an input into production processes, and an output of certain organisations, including, but not limited to, universities. The knowing subject appears to become irrelevant, except insofar as he or she is a participant in the production and consumption of knowledge, a unit of ‘hu- man capital’. One may therefore suggest that the commodity theory of knowledge proposes implicitly the disappear- ance of the knower (and of the teacher) as knowledge is no longer thought of as a function or faculty of the subject. It becomes instead a performative quality of goods and of technical skills, or an economic good in itself. The person who knows, or who learns and masters a discipline of knowledge, no longer holds a central position. People are, through knowledge, invested with skill, a quality that enhances the value of ‘human capital’. But knowledge is equated with skill (the ability or power to perform, seen as a quality of that special commodity known as ‘labour’) or with some per- formance-enhancing quality of a physical commodity or a service. Knowledge thus becomes identified with activities inherent in certain jobs, or with features of a commodity that are considered to be ‘sophisticated, innovative, creative, or of improved utility.’ Knowledge, as a form of capital, is to be accumulated, managed and applied. The imperative for organisations, including universities, is thus to accumulate and manage knowledge as efficiently and competitively as possible. If this can be done more efficiently by a machine, then the machine is more useful to the organisation than the person. The person as object and subject of knowledge is replaced by the unreflective manager, the information technician, and the ‘end-user’ or consumer of knowledge. The human sciences, under such a regime, would thus no longer be about humanity as an object and subject of knowledge; but about services and skills designed to minimise social and environmental risks, and about ‘good citizenship’.
Universities, as the organisations within which the human sciences in modern times have largely been developed, must inevitably change under such a transformed self-conception of their role. The University is no longer pre-eminent in the production and dissemination of knowledge. These functions are now more competitively distributed throughout societies, across the globe; and the exchange of information becomes electronically networked and less localised. The University would thus ‘collapse’, metaphorically speaking. It loses its heirarchical integrity and cultural distinction, and, as it becomes a competitive network-based enterprise, it loses its geographical ‘locatedness’. The institution of the University thus would collapse into a certification post within ‘knowledge networks’. Knowledge production is no longer the prerogative of the University, becoming instead the domain of governmental and industrial organisations, as users and producers. The legitimation role of the University is no longer of a national-emancipatory or character- building kind. It is reduced instead to legitimation in the form of certification. The University certifies knowledge by discovering and inventing novel products and by including selected forms of knowledge in its curriculum. It also certi- fies workers by granting them qualifications. This is essentially a service to Industry and to Government.
What, then, of the fate of the humanities, as disciplines within the University, under such a regime? The humanities already struggle to establish their legitimate place as disciplines that educate and that have a value in themselves, in- cluding the advancement and study of epistemology itself. The views of the TES are revealing when it does touch upon the role and value of the humanities. According to the TES, the humanities are producers of ‘generic skills’, a broad category that is said to strengthen the individual’s ability to participate actively as a citizen, while also contributing to national ‘cultural identity’. More specifically, ‘generic skills’ include such skills as planning and organising, commu- nicating and working with others, being enterprising and innovative, and thinking analytically. These are undoubtedly useful skills that may be developed through higher education (not only in the humanities), as well as through a range of other life experiences. So, the promotion of ‘generic skills’ does little to justify any special role or value of the hu- manities. The acquisition of ‘generic skills’ is also characterised by the TES as being ‘critical to the maintenance of a

<p>New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1, June 2004
healthy democracy’ (p. 47) and they are linked to ideas of national cultural self-recognition or multi-cultural ‘celebra- tion’. It is thought that those with good ‘generic skills’ are highly employable, regardless of the specific disciplines in which they were educated. They are ‘flexible and adaptable’, better prepared for ‘life-long learning’, and their skills are thus less likely to become ‘obsolete’.
While the humanities clearly have no monopoly or pre-eminence in the production of ‘generic skills’, this role is the only justification that the TES can offer for them in the new tertiary education system:
... arguably generic skills provision is one of the core functions of a university in light of its overall pur- pose to advance, maintain and disseminate knowledge... (TES, p. 47).
Knowledge derived from the study of the humanities is thus reduced to the production of socially and economically useful skills. Moreover, as an institutional model for the future of the humanities, the reader of the TES is offered, on the page facing the above-quoted passage, Alverno College. And here lies one of the more absurd aspects of this document.
From Oxbridge to Alverno: the model liberal-arts university
At the time of their establishment, New Zealand’s universities took as their examples and standard-setters the Uni- versities of Edinburgh, London, Oxford and Cambridge. The selection of professors and the examination of students were undertaken by colleagues at such institutions. In recent years, this kind of practice may sometimes be regarded as evidence of colonial ‘cultural cringe’, but it may more rightly be viewed as a determination to ensure that the colony’s fledgling universities were established on the basis of the highest international standards available at the time. The desire to maintain internationally credible standards is, of course, still with us. The TES makes statements about New Zealand’s aspiration to ‘world-class standards’ of tertiary education. In contemporary times, the Oxbridge, London and Edinburgh models may not necessarily be the only points of reference, though. Many North-American or Australian universities now set good examples for New Zealand.
It is curious to see Alverno College presented by the TES as the model for the teaching of a liberal arts curriculum, however. No-one I have spoken to has heard of Alverno College, and so the reader should note that it is an independent Catholic institution in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, specialising in liberal-arts education for women. It has about 4,000 stu- dents. Its curriculum is a ‘general education’ based on core ‘abilities’ (similar to the ‘generic skills’ discussed above) rather than on disciplines, which appear to be given less emphasis, and majors only appear later in their four-year degree. Although I am in no position to pass judgement on the quality of education or scholarship at Alverno College, it hardly seems like an internationally-recognised model of ‘excellence’ for a liberal-arts education.
Given this obscure example for the humanities, as well as the reduction of these disciplines’ worth to their ability to generate useful skills (being a good listener, adaptable thinker, etc.), the TES does not offer much hope for their future role in the University in New Zealand. In mitigation of this bleak outlook, it can only be pointed out that Govern- ment has, since the publication of the TES, sought to alleviate some of the concerns of university staff. The Tertiary Education Reform Act 2002, for example, includes among its ‘objects’ such phrases as ‘the development of cultural and intellectual life’ and ‘international standards of learning’. Moreover, the requirement of the Education Act that Universities act as ‘critic and conscience of society’ remains unchanged.
Nevertheless, the establishment under the new legislation of the Tertiary Education Commission does present the possibility of a level of intervention into the University curriculum, via manipulation of the public funding of tuition, that may potentially operate as a denial of institutional autonomy of the University (where ‘institutional autonomy’ is understood in terms of the self-governing freedom to determine research, scholarship, curriculum and assessment standards, rather than in terms of managerial freedom). For example, although the universities and their academic staff may widely hold the opinion that each university should include its own Philosophy Department and its relevant courses, it is not inconceivable that the Tertiary Education Commission could decide that it is not in New Zealand’s national interest to maintain so many of them, and that the Government only need fund, say, three universities to of- fer such majors. It remains to be seen whether the Commission’s decision-making will have effects on institutional autonomy of such a far-reaching nature.

Academic performance
While the ‘outputs’ of universities (in the forms of new knowledge and useful skills) are thought to enhance national economic performance, the tertiary education reforms also set their sights on the performance of the academic staff of universities. Government is particularly concerned to implement systems that will raise the overall ‘quality’ or ‘excel- lence’ of teaching and research. The Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) – the very name of which lends sup- port to the case being made in this article – has initiated a complex new set of bureaucratic procedures for rating staff according to their apparent standing or prestige among their peers (among other criteria). The more ‘high-powered’ researchers a university employs, the more money it gets. This is intended to be a ‘reward’ for high performance in research, as well as an incentive to raise the overall quality of the institution’s research ‘outputs’.
A similar exercise is to be undertaken with regard to teaching quality. A portion of the funding for courses, largely based upon enrolment numbers, will be set aside and redistributed according to a rating of ‘quality’. An assessment of performance will, of course, have to be devised and implemented, and another parallel set of bureaucratic procedures will be introduced to create compliance with this. In both cases, institutional and individual participation is almost guaranteed because a significant portion of funding stands ‘at risk’.
It is not necessary in this context to examine or critique the details of these performance-assessment methods. All of the usual problems associated with such systems, especially where money is at stake, will arise – and many of these issues are considered in the Report of the PBRF Working Group, Investing in Excellence (2002). The advent of performance-based assessment and funding deserves consideration because these mechanisms illustrate the imbed- dedness of performativity within the new University. The public (i.e., published) expression of academic freedom will become an economic good: ‘balance-sheet’ evidence of one’s contribution to ‘knowledge and innovation’ that may be counted and thus exchanged for income, and even transferred between institutions. The academic successes of students and the special relationships that they enjoy with the best teachers will also become evidence for enhancing income. Resistance to this system may lead to the marginalisation and economic poverty of one’s discipline, accompanied by the vague threat of eventual redundancy. Obedience, ‘performance’, and (above all) the ability to demonstrate one’s ‘excellence’ will pay dividends.
Systems that reallocate income on the basis of assessed performance, however, tend to result in a number of prob- lems. There are inequities perceived in the assessment itself or in the formula for redistributing incomes based on the assessment; inequalities of ‘wealth’ grow; many participants in the system become ‘stuck’ in a low-income, low-qual- ity spiral that may not reflect their potential to ‘perform’ and may be very difficult to counteract. The emphasis on funding by student numbers will decline somewhat, but it will still remain a major factor. Universities will still have an incentive to seek incomes from low-marginal-cost, high-throughput courses. More staff will be allocated to teach- ing-only roles, and the tendency towards invidious comparison (between individuals and between institutions) will be heightened. Institutions will be encouraged to ‘disinvest’ in some areas, leading to closures and redundancies. This may include some institutions that are providing degrees not backed up by research; and many university staff may be pleased to see them depart from the field.
There is nothing subtle about this shift in institutional manners, and it is certainly a part of a globally-recognisable change in higher-education policy and in the very nature of the University itself. It is harder to perceive exactly what this may represent as a symptom of the evolution of the epistemic field: the framework of disciplines and of knowl- edge that determine what may be thought and what cannot be thought (Foucault 1994). A future ‘archaeologist’ of the academic disciplines may well discern, within the changing structures that have been described here, the signs of a major shift in the foundations of our knowledge of, and of the disciplines concerning, ‘humanity’. How, and under what conditions, will one reflect upon ‘humanity’ in the new University?
The TES in political context
To round this discussion out, some comments designed to question or to mitigate the foregoing seem called for. My intention has been initially to examine one central document issued by government in its process of ‘reforming’ tertiary education in New Zealand, the Tertiary Education Strategy. This document serves the discursive purpose of setting out a ‘vision’ for a future resulting from projected ‘reforms’ – a new order which is intended to be consistent with the government’s overall social and economic objectives. I have analysed some of the rhetorical devices used by the TES,
Page 7</p>
<p>New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1, June 2004
and this has uncovered an underlying theory of knowledge implied within it, as well as some possible practical effects of the forthcoming changes. I have also ventured to hypothesise a ‘global’ historical shift in mainstream epistemology, in which the TES is but a small contribution. Historians in the future may well prove me wrong. The inertia, indiffer- ence, resistance or disobedience of people and institutions may stand in the way of the realisation of this governmental ‘vision’ – and thus dilute all of the hypothetical consequences that are discussed above. Politics and political economy may veer off in other, unpredictable directions. Certainly, there is evidence that the present government has articulated a broader vision and values for tertiary education than that implicit within the TES on its own. For example, the fol- lowing is an extract from a speech by the Prime Minister at the launch of the Tertiary Education Commission:
While inevitably future strategies for education have a strong and necessary focus on how to drive a stronger, up market economy, they must also focus on the intrinsic benefits and qualities of education.
Put simply, an educated, knowledgeable community is likely to be a more interesting, tolerant, and out- ward looking community. I stand strongly for the role of education in producing well rounded, highly liter- ate, well informed New Zealanders, who are aware of the world around us, of history, of cultural heritage, and of the great ideas and philosophies which have driven humankind. Education can never be reduced to a mere economic input. It has the potential to transform the lives of individuals and whole communi- ties. Its focus must be broad and empowering, not narrow and confining (Clark, <a href="http://www.beehive.govt.nz">www.beehive.govt.nz</a> 13 February 2003).
Those words reflect some level of adherence to the traditional values of liberal education which have informed the University at least since Newman. Nonetheless, it is already evident from current educational practice that the com- modity form of ‘knowledge’ is presently prominent, if not predominant, in the implicit mainstream epistemology. There is no doubt that the study of ‘humanity’ (be it quasi-scientific, or more philosophical in nature) is fundamentally affected by these contemporary processes of institutional change.
The position of university staff
One question that naturally arises from this discussion concerns the political and intellectual response that univer- sity staff should adopt in reaction to the policy changes in tertiary education in general and to its specific elements such as the TES and the PBRF. The above discussion will have left the reader in no doubt that the present author has deep misgivings about these ‘reforms’, and these are certainly shared by many colleagues nationally.
Our response should naturally begin from the premise of academic freedom, an unconditional freedom to test, to question and to profess ideas and theories, even those that may seem to some to be impractical, improbable or un- popular. No-one that I know of, however, has claimed that academic freedom means ‘freedom from accountability’. Our work is subjected to ethical, logical and intellectual scrutiny, and we observe standards of evaluation by our peers – and often by the wider community – that in many respects are far more rigorous than those imposed on other authors or public commentators.
The present Labour-led government has proposed a series of methods for holding universities more accountable for the quality of what they do. We have already seen the PBRF in action, and we may now expect evaluations of teaching quality as well. Neither government nor the public would be very impressed by arguments that ‘academic freedom’ somehow exempts us from such accountability. Given that funding is at risk under these mechanisms, no university can afford to neglect them, and staff have an obligation as employees to comply with reasonable requirements. Further, our representation in policy development processes through the Association of University Staff allows us to have a voice in how these new systems should be designed and implemented. Such forms of participation, however, do not mean that we are in any way bound to political quiescence or passive acceptance of the results.
The Minister for Tertiary Education has repeatedly assured us that the PBRF does not interfere with academic free- dom, on the grounds that it does not dictate or shape what research and scholarship should be done or how it should be done. It only purports to assess its ‘quality’. Indeed, I would hope that university staff do not allow their research to be influenced or driven by the PBRF. Funding systems should support and be led by research and scholarship, not the other way around. I know, however, that that hope is not reflected in the behaviour of all of my colleagues. I also know that the PBRF is inevitably an interference in academic freedom, no matter what the Minister says. While it may

in some respects be a good thing to reveal the strong and the weak elements in the universities’ research performance, the system in use will inevitably have undesirable, invidious and manipulative effects that will adversely affect the freedom of some staff to pursue independently their own intellectual and scientific aspirations.
However, the world before the PBRF was also far from ideal in this respect. The PBRF changes the landscape, but the assertion and practice of academic freedom still depend largely upon our own initiative. The fact that one can write a critical appraisal of the ‘reforms’ of university funding and the wider context in which they seem to play a part demonstrates that there is and there will remain a vital element in university life that stands apart from the partial and historically-contingent demands of commerce and government. In refusing to concern oneself with government’s ‘na- tional goals’ and continuing to write as an independent thinker, one thus performs an important public role within an intellectually progressive and open community. One cannot transcend the discursive effects of those regimes of power that shape the conduct of societies and the understanding of ‘truth’. But the institutionalised principle of academic freedom provides a space for reflection and critical examination. Even as government strives to shape our future, we will be ruthlessly testing its assumptions and evaluating its effects.

2 Pouvoir as an infinitive verb means ‘to have the ability, possibility or right [to do something]’. As a noun, it trans- lates as ‘power’, including the senses of ‘legal or political authority’, as well as ‘personal capacity [to do something]’. Savoir as an infinitive verb means ‘to know, to know of [something], or to know how [to do something]’. In this latter sense, it is sometimes substitutable for pouvoir. Savoir may also be used as a noun, translatable as ‘knowledge’ in the sense of ‘body or system of knowledge’, or in the practical sense of savoir-faire, meaning ‘competence, the ability to resolve practical problems’. The title of this essay could thus be liberally translated as ‘Power and knowledge’. The infinitive-verb form does not resolve itself at all well in English, however.

University Research: where Gift and Market Economics Meet. Keith Rankin, School of Accounting, Law and Finance, Unitec
Universities, in the broadest sense of the word, are central to both the public knowledge society and the private capi- talist economy. Academic institutions inject private knowledge (&#39;human capital&#39;), through their teaching function, and produce public knowledge both through both their research function and their consciousness-raising role as a &quot;critic and conscience&quot; to society.
These different functions are so different that they cannot be funded by a single funding model. Where the accu- mulation of human capital leads to professional employment and high lifetime incomes, then a form of market model is appropriate. Hence, it is appropriate that a higher proportion of funding for say law or architecture schools should be market determined than for say schools of science or humanities. Having noted that, the research function of all schools is less amenable to the market model, because university research is public good research.
The creation of a monopsonistic pseudo-market with the government as the sole buyer of public good research does not achieve an efficient allocation of resources. It simply reflects a conservative bureaucratic view of what kind of public knowledge is good for the New Zealand economy.
Some research has very specific economic objectives. Such research is demand driven; there is a buyer who is dis- tinctly separate from the researcher or supplier. There is nothing wrong with such research, and there is no reason why the government cannot be a buyer of such research. However there is much research that cannot be funded this way. The outputs of research are unknown. People cannot buy what they cannot imagine.
Our historical experience suggests that the most important research is supply-driven and has only vague economic goals, if any. It is motivated by the particular passions of the individual researchers. Such research is understood better as belonging to the gift economy than to the market economy.
Despite the fact that this second kind of research has no economic objective, it has almost certainly had a greater economic impact. Capitalism owes a huge debt to the gift economy, in particular to the gifts of knowledge and ideas. Indeed capitalism cannot be understood without an understanding of the way the passions of the gift economy energise the market economy, much as the sun energises the biosphere.
Knowledge is important to capitalism in three ways.
First, it can be used as a bargaining chip. Private knowledge – knowledge that I have and you do not have – can give me an economic advantage over you. This is the kind of knowledge that drives some of the calls for a knowledge economy. (In the New Zealand Herald of 24 August 1999, Kay Sowerby eulogised about knowledge in this vein, while I stated the case for a public knowledge economy.) For example, it is seen as good for a country to have working in it a large proportion of those &quot;symbolic analysts&quot; (Reich) who are blessed with this kind of private knowledge.
It is not clear that this kind of knowledge does much to advance the world economy, or even the national economy. Rather it creates a divided society and a knowledge deficit amongst the excluded.
To understand the other two forms of knowledge it helps to note the distinction between invention and innovation first made by Joseph Schumpeter 90 years ago in his Theory of Economic Development. Innovation is the adoption of knowledge into the productive process. Innovation is a market activity, but is not automatic in the static market econo- mies of our textbooks. One of the most ubiquitous mottos of business is: &quot;if it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it&quot;. Innovation hap- pens more in a market economy plagued with problems; in an economy where imaginative fixes are required. Survival prompts more innovation than does high profits. Necessity is the mother of innovation, not invention.
Innovation is not the business of universities; it&#39;s the business of business. Innovation works best, however, when there is a smorgasbord of new knowledge for business to draw on. Just imagine the West Coast wild foods festival. The tables are full of foods that most onlookers have never tried before.
The third form of knowledge is invention and discovery. Inventors are primary knowledge workers. Passion and Page 1
New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1, June 2004
imagination are the mothers of invention. Increasingly, though, finance is the handmaiden of invention. Getting your idea onto that smorgasbord table in an economically useful or culturally interesting form requires financial support, facilities (like sophisticated libraries) and colleagues who you can bounce your ideas off and who can play devil&#39;s advocate. Most of all, it requires time; freedom from the immediate economic needs of finding food and shelter and entertainment for one&#39;s family.
300 years ago you probably had to be a member of the leisured land-owning class before you could make any sub- stantial contribution of knowledge through the gift economy. 800 years ago maybe a monastery was the best place to be. Today, the best place for primary knowledge workers to be is a university.
If, however, we fetter the ability of universities to gift new knowledge and ideas, then the primary knowledge &#39;in- dustry&#39; must whither. If we allow only research that is purchased (or that satisfies some bureaucrat&#39;s sense of political correctness) to proceed then the smorgasbord of new ideas and macroinventions will dry up. (Macroinventions are the big new ideas that changed the world; see Joel Mokyr&#39;s interpretation of Schumpeter&#39;s economic history: The Lever of Riches.) The intellectual gifts that enlightened the world will be in short supply. The passionate and the imaginative will eschew the time-consuming process of applying for research funding which, even if received, may not be enough to see through a project with an indeterminate end point. Tenured academics will retreat into the comfort zone of un- dergraduate teaching and early retirement.
The irony is that primary knowledge workers never asked for much. Especially in New Zealand. They don&#39;t want huge salaries; just enough to function professionally and without being subject to relative poverty in their private lives. New Zealand is rare in that it can attract or keep good primary knowledge workers – good artists (e.g., people with arts degrees) and scientists - for remuneration less than half of what they might expect to get in London or Boston.
Creating an environment conducive to substantial collective research outcomes need not cost a public fortune. Further, primary knowledge workers create substantial backward and forward linkages (Hirschman, 1986) into the economies which host them.
The present government&#39;s policy is to promote &#39;science&#39; and provide less financial support for training &#39;lawyers and accountants&#39;. One problem at present is that there are not nearly as many employment opportunities for scientists as there are for lawyers. Training more scientists will not solve the problem. We solve the problem by employing more scientists and other primary knowledge workers. Then more people will want to train to be knowledge workers.
The university is the central institution of a knowledge society. Universities are communities of three kinds of people: undergraduate students, postgraduate students cum junior academics, and academic leaders (&#39;professors&#39; for want of a better word).
It&#39;s the middle group - postgraduate students cum research assistants cum junior academics - that has to be fostered to create a dynamic research environment. Their financial support can come from a mixture of salaries, fellowships, scholarships, allowances, social dividends, tax credits and loans. It needs to be an inclusive environment, a place of both intense intellectual challenge, and of constructive leisure for those who would otherwise be underemployed. Student loans need to be able to be serviced in ways that are flexible, and do not inhibit young adults from forming families and buying homes.
It&#39;s not really a question of funding universities or of funding research. It&#39;s a question of funding people, empower- ing them to participate in knowledge communities that enable them to give something back, to perpetuate the cycle of give and take that drives the public side of our economy forward.
It is not appropriate for the government to discourage students from studying particular subjects, or to discourage university staff from the areas of research for which they have a passion. The government may buy research, in com- petition with the private sector, from universities. But it should not do so by inhibiting researcher-led research. The government needs to encourage people of all ages to participate in post-graduate research-rich programmes. And, if it wants to pick favoured areas of study, the government should do so by providing jobs for the graduates of the favoured programmes.

<p>New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1, June 2004
By all means let the government buy research from our universities, but not by creating a model by which all re- search must have a buyer. Economic and social development depends on the smorgasbord of new knowledge that makes innovation possible.

Managerialism and the University
Mathew Fitzsimons, University of Auckland.
Of Milojevic’s six1 models of the university; the university as corporation has emerged as the dominant model at least in the Anglophone countries.
There has been a transformation of academics, from loosely managed professionals to ‘white collar workers’. Whilst I will focus on the transformation of academic staff, similar processes are also impacting on the general staff of universities. The changes to academic worklife have been wrought by incorporating the practices prevalent in the corporatised public sector and large corporations.
The quietism of many academics and the advocacy of senior managers does not explain the wholesale adoption of “new management” or managerialist ideas by New Zealand and Australian universities. The primary determinants for changes within the universities are manifestly external. The socio-political changes of the past two decades have culminated in the adoption of “new management” strategies by universities. Academics are subjected to market discipline by proxy, their students have been transformed into consumers, and degrees have become products.
Academics hold allegiances to disciplines and to colleagues outside their own university and share in academic practices that mould them as scholars. I believe there is sufficient inertia within the university system to sustain the “idea of the university “ and ensure its survival. In this paper I will outline these ideas, examining the changes for staff of the corporate university, the nature of university management and the means of supporting the values of the university in the current climate. I will not discuss in detail the socio-political changes of the 1980s 1990s as they will be familiar to this audience.
The “withering of the state” entailed the reduction of state resources to education and the opening of the sector to privatisation. The scaling back of the state-funding of education was accompanied by an increase in financial monitoring and the shifting of the financial burden of education to students and their families. Coinciding with these political changes the state inaugurated a second wave of massification of the sector. New Zealand, along with its OECD partners subscribed to increasing participation under the heading of Learning for Life with a reduction of per capita funding.
The White Paper “Tertiary Education in New Zealand: Policy Directions for the 21st Century” (1998) would have advanced this agenda greatly. Despite the failure to enact the White Paper, market competition was introduced, with the fees funding regime and student loans both underpinning the commodification of education.
The corporate university is just another business. It strives to be independent of the state and conceives of itself as an autonomous bureaucratic organisation. Its primary rationale is as a place for vocational training and credentialism. The corporate university is a complex entity. Whilst its ideal form is the business firm, and indeed it contains firms which are fully fledged enterprises open to the marketplace, it also contains significant aspects of a collegial management style. It is happy to cushion its ‘high flyers’ from some of the rigours of the corporate management. Increasingly the rest of the staff are subject to a range of control mechanisms.
The corporate university management is a hybrid, which retains vestiges of the collegium interpolated into a streamlined committee decision process. The collegial power once exercised by academics through control of key committees and sub-committees of the Academic Board is gone, although the Board still remains as a locus of power within the ambit of academics as a collegium.
Executive deans and senior academics now work within a decision making structure that includes key members of the bureaucracy and the strategic apex of the university. These collegial/managerial hybrids behave like the former collegiums when they take decisions. The chairs of these hybrid committees, like the former chair of the collegial committee, are ‘first amongst equals’. They capture the consensus of the group, and rarely does any issue go to a vote. Whilst the old collegium acted as a buffer (albeit a conservative force) on university management the hybrid rarely challenges powerful decision making from the strategic apex of the university.

The university as a non-profit organisation has difficulty emulating the marketplace. There are however a number of proxies for market place discipline which have been borrowed from industry and the newly restructured state sector.
These proxies include measures of performance and change in work processes. Performance measures; performance appraisal and benchmarking are ensconced as management tools to assess academic performance. Academics accept that evaluation of courses is useful and necessary, much student evaluation is used in a crude and instrumentalist fashion. Workload policies and formulas are increasingly used to enhance management control over staff, if not a blatant ‘speed up’ of academic work. Workload policies also have the potential of decoupling teaching and research, creating academics who only teach. The external funding of research is accompanied by contracts for service from the grant providers; academics buy out their teaching commitments. The creation of a casual, or contract cadre of staff, if not the casualisation of the majority of staff, is a further mechanism for enhancing management control.
I do not view university management as ideologues who have embraced managerialism, rather I view the spread of managerialist ideas as part of a mimetic process. The management ideas that prevail in the sector betray eclecticism rather than a wholesale adoption of managerialism. The neo-liberal notion of ‘provider capture’, which was the implicit rationale adopted in the White Paper for restricting staff on Councils, has been largely ignored within universities. But just like Third World countries and the International Monetary Fund, university management are quick to toe the line when faced with challenge by government about financial or organisational matters.
Many academics and some students reject this instrumentalist view. Academics see the danger of being positioned as ‘providers’ and their students as consumers who acquire products. Nevertheless a notion such as the intrinsic value of university education is viewed as quaint and unsustainable by government.
New Zealand universities face a crisis of underfunding and one of retention and recruitment of academic staff (and specialist general staff). The decision to reduce expenditure on tertiary education was a political one. The labour process favoured by corporate firms is seen as a partial solution to the problem the university faces in managing its knowledge workers. The message to staff is the same litany the world over; there is no alternative. The danger for the university is the erosion of the value system that sustains the institution as a unique entity; an entity that looks to the future needs of society and humanity. Credentialism and other instrumentalist views of the value of university education is widespread (especially amongst students) in the corporate university.
The values inherent in the traditional notion of the university include: the value of academic success as pleasure rather than something with exchange value; the value of working at the highest level of thought, inquiry, professional competence, personal development and self-knowledge; the value of applying knowledge and technology to address human problems. The short hand for this value system is the “Idea of the University”2. These values, whilst under threat can still be found within academic disciplines and the community of scholars they are composed of.
The community of scholars and their practices are vital for the maintenance of the ‘idea of the university’ as a place that treasures these values. These values and practices have evolved over a millennium and are still evolving. The advent of the information age (usually incorrectly dubbed the knowledge society, economy etc) requires the disinterested search for truth amongst the tidal wave of ‘information’.
The academic disciplines are the sites where these values can be strengthened and promoted. The “idea of the university” supports the free exchange of ideas with colleagues working in a similar area, the replication of experiments by colleagues, the free consultation with colleagues on papers, articles, and projects and the free refereeing of student and colleagues’ work.
Resistance to the potentially destructive tendencies of the corporate university comes from the value system that remains within academic disciplines, the belief held by university staff about the university role and the strengthening of the academic voice in decision making by devolution of power to departments.
The ‘idea of the university’ is not inimical to new ideas, . The emulation of the corporate flat structure and the devolution of decision making by universities may be advantageous. I believe that the devolution of decision making to departments has the potential of strengthening academic practice, the growth of university community and the evolution of collegiality to workplace democracy.

The 3rd report of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission talks about a paradigm shift, it seems to promise an amelioration of the corporate model of tertiary education:
The tertiary education system will no longer be solely driven by the choices of consumers as it was during the 1990s, when it was too narrowly focused on demand as the primary determinant of resource allocation.
Yes we will embrace nation building and the strengthening of New Zealand cultures, but first we must have a com- mitment from the state to support an independent autonomous university system.

It is a Maori tradition to introduce oneself at the commencement of a speech. It is also Maori tradition to associ- ate oneself with particular landmarks or regions of importance, to ourselves and to our ancestors. Increasingly more Maori are being made aware of who they are and are becoming able to identify themselves as Maori in much the same way as their ancestors. This is important to being able to live, and participate, in society as Maori. Recently, Dr Mason Durie, of Massey University in Palmerston North, addressed a national meeting for Maori education. He introduced a framework for considering Maori educational advancement. Included in this framework were three important goals for Maori.
Goal 1.
To live as Maori. Durie discusses this goal as being able to have access to the Maori world, that is access to language, culture, marae, resources such as land, tikanga, whanau, and kaimoana. Being able to live as Maori means being able to identify oneself as Maori, and to also be prepared to participate in Maori society. It is not simply to learn about Maori but also to live as Maori.
Goal 2.
To actively participate as citizens of the world. There is a wide Maori expectation that education should open doors to technology, to the economy, to the arts and sciences, to understanding others, and to making a contribution to the greater good. It means that Maori will be able to live in, and participate in a number of situations without sacrificing opportunities for Maori advancement. It is simply not good enough for a Maori person to have the capacity to partici- pate as a citizen of the world if his or her Maori identity is to be sacrificed.
Goal 3.
To enjoy good health and a high standard of living. Education should be able to make a major – if not the major – contribution to health and wellbeing and to a decent standard of living. Educational achievement relates directly to income levels, health standards and quality of life.
These goals can be used as a model to assess Maori development in tertiary education. Let us consider the devel- opment of Maori aspirations and expectations for tertiary education in terms of the recent tertiary education sector reforms.
The government has introduced a number of tertiary education reforms. These tertiary education reforms are de- signed to change the tertiary education system into an outward looking system, which is strongly linked with the com- munities of interest that it serves.
As a result of two Hui Taumata Matauranga, and some consultation meetings with Maori around New Zealand, the Ministry of Education is working on a Maori Tertiary Framework. This framework maps out the vision for Maori in tertiary education. It presents itself as a number of short to mid-term action priorities for government, communities
Page 1
New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1, June 2004
and tertiary providers. At this stage the Maori Tertiary Framework is being further developed by the Maori Tertiary Reference Group, established by the Ministry of Education.
The Maori Tertiary Framework outlines the need to strengthen the relationship between tertiary education and Maori communities so that Maori will see the purpose in participating. To achieve this there needs to be a more col- laborative relationship between the crown, the communities and the tertiary institutions. Mason Durie describes this as the principle of integrated action. This principle recognises the multiple players in education. There is a need for government policies to be matched more explicitly to Maori aspirations so that full advantage can be taken of whatever resources are already available.2
Alongside the Maori Tertiary Framework, the Ministry of Education also introduced a Tertiary Education Strategy, the first of its kind in New Zealand. Included in this strategy is a chapter on responsiveness to Maori. Within the next five years, the reformed tertiary education system should begin to respond to the high expectations and aspirations of Maori for tertiary education. The strategy is now the responsibility of the government so we are awaiting the final product.
The current reforms in the tertiary education system signal major changes for the tertiary education sector. An important role of the sector relates to Maori knowledge creation and knowledge transfer. One of the tertiary systems roles is to provide an environment where Maori knowledge is valued and accessible, and where it can be retained, shared and created.3
Maori development starts with people, their resources and their multiple aspirations.4 During this period of tertiary sector reforms AUS had the opportunity to respond and provide input into the development of the reforms.
Te Kahurangi Whaiti is the AUS Maori committee with an executive council consisting of a kaumatua, Te Awhina Arahi (National Office), the Maori Vice-President of AUS and representatives at each university.
We aim to safeguard the rights of Maori members and meet our responsibilities to wider Maori communities through the promotion of and adherence to the Treaty of Waitangi, by supporting Maori staff in achieving their objectives within AUS, the universities and the broader union movement.5
The following is a list of priorities which Te Kahurangi Whaiti have produced for Maori staff within the existing framework of the tertiary education sector. These priorities highlight the need of the institution to become more ac- countable to Maori staff, learners and communities for educational outcomes.
• Protection of Maori Culture
Considering Mason Durie’s three goals for Maori educational advancement, the protection of Maori culture falls under all three of the goals. Opportunities must foster the need for Maori to maintain their identity, for that to be reflected in day to day life, and for this to be understood by the employer.
Maori advancement is a wider aim and leadership must be able to paint the broader vision while at the same time signposting the roads that will lead there.6
• Culturally Safe Working and Learning Environments
The universities need to acknowledge the dignity and uniqueness of Maori and, as such, need to provide an
environment which nurtures the growth and development of Maori educational aspirations.
• Workloads
There are few Maori employed in the university sector. This results in a high workload expectation on those Maori who are working in the universities. They often assume responsibilities and participate in a lot of good will work, most of which is not recognised by the employer. Such work includes the pastoral care of the stu- dents, service to the community, cultural or iwi (tribal) responsibilities, ceremonies such as powhiri (formal Marae welcomes), and poroporoaki (formal farewells). Recognition for this good will work needs to be ac- knowledged through remuneration and promotion.
• Casualisation of Staff
Many Maori staff are employed on a casual basis. Definitions of casual staff need to be changed as many staff
Page 2</p>
<p>New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1, June 2004
could become fixed term and therefore covered by our collective agreement.
• Participation of Maori in Tertiary Education
In 2000, 441 Maori left secondary school with bursary as their highest qualification and 390 Maori left with entry to university as their highest qualification.7 So for that year in total [throughout New Zealand] 831 Maori school leavers were eligible to enter university. Many Maori who have struggled at school flourish at univer- sity.
It is interesting to note that the 2001 census information says that 1 in 21 Maori had a degree or higher qualifica- tion as their highest post-school qualification.8 It is the sector that needs re-positioning, not the student.
Approximately 3.5% of all university staff are Maori.9 Of this pool of staff, there needs to be an increased ca- pability for all staff to be effective in Maori tertiary education.
• Promotion and Salary Reviews
The current promotion and salary review procedures have huge implications on Maori staff. For example, many of the promotion procedures place Maori in a position of self-promotion. There is a Maori philosophy which explains this; ‘Kaore te kumara e korero ana ki tona reka’ - the kumara does not speak of its sweetness. Promo- tion comes as a result of doing your job well. The current procedures exclude many Maori from being rewarded for good work. These procedures need to be addressed and made culturally safe, and sensitive alternatives need to be adopted.
• Employmenr Agreement Negotiations
Promotions, salary review procedures, workloads issues, increase in salaries and better working conditions for
Maori need to be entrenched in employment agreements.
The AUS and Te Kahurangi Whaiti also intend to conduct a treaty audit of all AUS activities. The objective of this is to further develop an effective partnership between AUS and Te Kahurangi Whaiti and ensure that the needs of Maori are being reflected and articulated properly within the union. We need to ensure that all the unions activities reflect and support the development of Maori aspirations and expectations to; live as Maori, actively participate as citizens of the world, and enjoy good health and a high standard of living.
Success or failure is the result of many forces acting together – this includes institution and community, employers and employees, employers and unions, Maori and government and so on. This collaborative pathway can only bring positive results if it is associated with a genuine and mutual respect for the autonomy and integrity of the other.10

Mapping the New Imperialism: Where Is Postcolonialism?
Essay Review of Relocating Postcolonialism Eds. David Theo Goldberg &amp; Ato Quayson Oxford, Blackwells, 2002, pp. 371
Michael A. Peters
The question is a spatial one. Where is postcolonialism? It’s a question of location, or more precisely relocation. It is no longer located in the neighbourhood of modernism, May ’68, structural Marxism and decolonisation theory. Postcolonialism has been relocated down the hall, sharing offices with the postmodernists and poststructuralists, the “other standpoint and anti-hegemonic theories such as feminism, gay/lesbian and ethnic studies” (p. xi). Surprisingly, perhaps, it shares room with disability studies.
The question of location and disciplinary identity are thrown together, yet their intersection is addressed more in terms of the past than the future – more in terms of genealogy than cartography, although this much abused Nietzs- chean word is robbed of most of its originality. Thus, the editors Goldberg and Quayson introduce us to the new scale and sensibility of postcolonial studies by emphasising the recognisable standard, beginning with Said’s Orientalism (1978), traversing through Ashcroft et al’s The Empire Strikes Back (1989), and exploding into a range of trajectories – “image, culture and representation, studies of imperial and colonial history, anthropology, cultural studies, multicul- turalism, and diaspora” (p. xi).
The collection has no common agenda for revision but does cluster essays together. Chapters 1-4 (including Said, Bhabha, Spivak and Parry) provide conversational, personal and theoretical overviews. The next cluster focuses on race theory and diaspora -- Goldberg on racial state formations; Stoler on the rise of the French Right; Bailey and Barnor on slave narratives and oral histories. Quayson and Thompson (chapters 12 and 13) focus on disability in relation to questions of identity. Olu Oguibe’s essay (chapter 9) on “Connectivity and the Fate of the Unconnected”, a rumination on postcoloniality in the age of the Internet, the editors indicate, divides the collection. Ahluwahlia and Ma-Rhea (chapters 10 and 11) revisit the concept of the gift as a basis for examining issues of reconciliation, “knowl- edge exchange” and Commonwealth university formation. Noyes (chapter 14) investigates reconciliation in the truth commission of post-apartheid South Africa, while Lee (chapter 15) explores her performance as Korean American. Darian-Smith (chapter 16) provides an analysis of international property law in Hong Kong – a prolegomenon to a critique of neoliberal intellectual property rights regimes and Duncan (chapter 17) adds Ireland to the logic of becom- ing postcolonial. Wright and Hope (chapter 18) offer an example of postcolonial pedagogy in English studies; and, Françoise Verge (chapter 19) provides the closing postscript. All in all, the collection comprises a large and roving collection that broadens the frontiers of postcolonial theory and provides a kind of index to its transdisciplinary forma- tions. I shall focus on the first cluster of essays that provide a series of themes linking otherwise diverse approaches and topics pursued in individual chapters. These early chapters provide a series of motifs that thematically hold the collection together, in particular, the relation of postcolonial studies to its own historical conditions of emergence and its future – colonialism, neocolonialism, globalisation and neoliberalism.
Goldberg and Quayson identify three clusters (or “generative ambiguities”) of attitudes and ideas that constitute postcolonial studies: “the desire to speak to the Western paradigm of knowledge in the voice of otherness”; an af- fliction based on the fact that the field must simultaneously claim and disavow its object of study; and, its location everywhere and nowhere. The first recognises how interaction with subjected others constituted the very experience of Western modernity and today conditions the processes of globalisation. This “radical interdependency of forms” is explored in the value-laden hierarchies of binary oppositions that poststructuralism has taught us to scrutinise and deconstruct. The second refers to the fact that the social referents of postcolonial studies are marked by violence and anguish – a set of objects that postcolonialism is committed to dismantling while being “analytically fixated with it” (p. xiii). Third, the everywhere and nowhere hypothesis can be summed up in the question: “Is postcolonial theory the content of particular social referents, or the form of the discursive application of theories?” (p. xvi). The first of these “generative ambiguities”, I think, contains more than one thesis. The tropes of otherness, othering, the and the ethics
Page 1
New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy, Volume 1, June 2004
of the Other, contains more than is or can be unpacked by the editors in their introduction, or indeed, in one collection. The second seems less of an antinomy and more of a historical condition, while the third returns us to issues of space and location, although not as productively as it might.
While genealogy is a spatial term, at least as Foucault uses it in his spatialised histories, in the context of this collec- tion it feels more like a temporal concept (a synonym for history). In fact the whole collection carries the sense of time like a thin coat of dust that has accumulated over the last five to six years. While published in 2002, the collection has a late ‘90s feel of time about it. The conversational interviews with Said and Bhabha that lead off the volume were first conducted in 1997 and 1998, respectively. There is little sense of postcolonial dangers or the fact that we are headed into a new oil war and era of American hegemonic politics dominated by historic “we-they” prejudices and the revival of neoliberal binaries demonising the other, while sanctifying us ‘Christians’. There is no sense of the urgency brought on by that fact that we face a series of conceptual slippages: from al-Qa’eda “terrorists”, to the Iraqui rogue state, to Islam or the Muslim world per se and all within the space of a few months in the US war rhetoric of Bush hawks. The question of postcoloniality in respect of the Palestinians has, of course, been explored by Said, yet its present and un- folding formations in the imperial war of Afghanistan, “the war on terrorism”, and the impending war on Iraq, require a revisiting of postcoloniality not only in terms of so-called “world security” and developments of the world system of states but also in light of the call for a “new imperialism” by the likes of Robert Cooper, Tony Blair’s Deputy Secretary of the Defence and Overseas Secretariat (see Peters, 2002).
And yet there are also good renewable intellectual resources in this collection that will help us reflect on the current geopolitical reality. Let’s take for example, Said’s remark concerning neocolonialism (“I don’t think colonialism is over”, p. 2). The remark has an easy application: Iraq was a state whose boundaries were drawn up in 1921 by France and Britain, whose oil companies were granted in return, favoured access to Iraq’s huge oil reserves. (American oil companies were given favoured access to oil reserves in Saudi Arabia during the 1930s). How heavy the colonial past weighs on the present, demonstrating that simply histories and historiographies do not admit the complex skein of events in models that periodise the past into easy categories.
While Said prefers Orientalism to postcolonialism, as he suggests, its deep structure, which comprises, perhaps, a small and finite number of elements, still can generate a complicated structure able to multiply and profilerate it- self in new ways, like Chomsky’s syntactic structures. The old colonial binaries re-emerge in the postcolonial era as Huntington’s The Clash of Civilizations demonstrates so well.
Or, take, for example, Bhabha’s observation that the twin forces of economic deprivation and cultural and tech- nological dependence created indigenous national elites of a neo-colonial cast that became the willing or unwilling operatives of the IMF, the World bank, and other international cartels (p. 6).
Bhabha and Comaroff genealogise also, acknowledging that the novel recastings of Hegelian causality by the likes of Lukács, Althusser and others provided “only limited intellectual and ideological space for evaluating or validat- ing cultural translation, metissage, creolization, hybridization” (p. 20). Structural Marxism robbed “the agency of the culturally endowed colonized peoples” (p. 22) and stressed the need for more nuanced and differentiated colonized subjects as subjects of resistance.
Indeed, Comaroff’s question to Bhabha focuses our attention on the intellectual work postcolonial theory is expected to do: “What does a postcolonial optic bring to the discourse” “about the nature of neoliberal capitalism, of globaliza- tion, of the world post-1989”? (p. 23). Bhabha’s answer in terms of a “vernacular cosmopolitanism” as a mark of the postcolonial experience reaffirms how necessary it is to question the history of liberalism, its civilising mission, and its assumed individualism as a basis for any notion of rights and citizenship. Bhabha indicates that postcoloniality draws upon a notion of identity that is both more disseminatory and iterative than the homogenising notion underlying lib- eralism. In these contexts, political and cultural citizenship may stand opposed to one another. Certainly, both Bhabha and Comaroff wish to question the narration of modernist nations under postmodern conditions: how, for instance, imagining a “new” South Africa involved a language of modernist sovereign statehood that placed its faith in consti- tutionality, equality before the law, human rights and social justice, and the future of “rational” development. Perhaps, they muse together, after Hobsbawm, the African National Congress was the last great Euronationalist movement.
Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak’s essay “Resident Alien” (Chapter 3) begins with the proposition “Large scale move- ments of people – renamed ‘diaspora’ – are what defines our time”, both the ethics of hospitality and the migrant in metropolitan space. She surmises that the figure of the resident alien belongs to postcoloniality, which she then ex-

plores through the work of Tagore’s Gora and Kipling’s Kim. Benita Parry explores direction and dead ends in postco- lonial studies, commenting upon the dismissal of political economy and foundational and deterministic readings that spring from a fusing of postcolonialism with postmodernism.
This collection operates more like a compendium than a collection; its theme of relocation feels more like an ex post facto recasting than original intention. Given its publication this year it is unfortunate that the editors have not addressed the looming storms of war. It would seem to be the appropriate historically poised moment from which to discuss “the new imperialism” and to theorise the futures of postcoloniality.

Book Review’
Richard P. Chait (ed.) The Questions of Tenure Cambridge, MA., Harvard University Press, 2002 $US35.00.
Paul McKechnie, University of Auckland
This edited book consists of ten policy-oriented studies originating in the Harvard Project on Faculty Appointments. Richard P. Chait in the Introduction (pp1-5) disclaims any intention of getting down and dirty with advocates for or against tenure as such. Chait, author of Beyond Traditional Tenure (1982), is established as a moderate anti-tenure voice. But here he claims to offer none of the ‘philosophical predispositions, anecdotes, and personal experiences or preferences’ (1) which you would find lower down the food chain, in Matthew W. Finkin’s The Case for Tenure (1996), for instance, or, conversely, Charles J. Sykes’s Profscam (1988). The professed goal is ‘research-based, data-driven answers to ... questions about tenure policy and practice’ (2).
Policy-oriented work, however, even when it is high-minded about being data-driven, cannot for long ignore the bottom line question—what ought to be done, if only it were possible to do it? Nor is data-drivenness (as a manifesto item) any guarantee of empirically-founded independence from ‘philosophical predisposition’ or its downmarket ava- tars (in Profscam and books like it).
The Questions of Tenure, however, is not simply another book against academic tenure as it exists in the USA. Contributors use data informatively and sometimes impressively. Cathy A. Trower, in a chapter called ‘What is Cur- rent Policy?’ (pp32-68) demonstrates how close to uniformity institutional practice is, and how influential the AAUP’s 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure remains; and in a second chapter (‘Can Colleges Competitively Recruit Faculty without the Prospect of Tenure?’ [pp182-220]) she more or less shows why, from focus group surveys of young scholars (i.e. doctoral candidates) about what kinds of job offers they would prefer. ‘The pos- sibility of tenure was a powerful draw’ (p215).
Which, perhaps, no one doubted. Trower says (same page) that ‘the lure of tenure ... had to do with socialisation and status’, and explains that ‘young scholars ... learnt from professors, mentors and peers, that the only “legitimate” academic path was the tenure track’. Maybe this is ‘socialisation’—but then , it’s not hard (why would it be?) for people to come to believe that they ought to have job security.
William T. Mallon’s chapter, ‘Why is Tenure One College’s Problem and Another’s Solution?’ (pp246-72) addresses the complexity of the issue better, in a nuanced study, based on interviews at three colleges which have gone from ten- ure to contracts in recent years, and three which have gone from contracts to tenure. Did those which brought tenure in improve the quality of faculty? Perhaps, for new faculty: slightly higher turnover rates for performance-related reasons resulted (p271). Did those which abolished it become financially securer as institutions? Not in all cases: institutions forced to downsize for fiscal reasons were likely to make some tenured staff redundant while retaining oth- ers who were non-tenured, and in one of Mallon’s cases ‘decision-makers relied on the presumption that a multiyear contract system was short-term and flexible and that tenure was lifelong and rigid.’ Mallon comments: ‘as policy was actually practiced, neither impression proved to be correct’ (p259). This chapter is a high point in the book.
Elsewhere, most studies deliver well-grounded, but not surprising, answers. ‘What Happened to the Tenure Track?’ ask Roger G. Baldwin and Jay L. Chronister (pp125-159): it’s still there, they find, though (data show) not equally prevalent in all disciplines; trackers are still sweating, and those not on the track still invisible and undervalued. ‘Does Faculty Governance Differ at Colleges with and without Tenure?’ asks Richard Chait (69-100): he finds tenure to be ‘a reliable, but not infallible, indicator of greater faculty voice and slightly greater faculty interest in campus governance’—but, more likely (says Chait, the tenure reformer), ‘tenure signalled rather than created these conditions’ (p96). ‘Can Faculty be Induced to Relinquish Tenure?’ asks Charles T. Clotfelder (pp221-245): maybe, is the answer, in return for valuable inducements whose cost ought to make an institution which wants to go down that road think

twice (p242).
R. Eugene Rice and Mary Deane Sorcinelli in ‘Can the Tenure Process be Improved?’ (pp101-124) focus less on process issues as such than their title might suggest, and instead advocate more thorough adoption of the priorities argued for in Ernest L. Boyer’s Scholarship Reconsidered (1990).
There is a chapter, by Philip J. Altbach, called ‘How are Faculty Faring in Other Countries?’ (pp160-181). Europe (above all, Western Europe), North America and Australia are the homes of university systems which deliver suffi- cient income to professors to maintain a middle-class social status, and there are few other such places (Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and some Arabian Gulf states are mentioned [pp167, 176]). Conditions in China, South Asia, South America, Africa are worsening: ‘academic salaries have deteriorated worldwide, and there is no sign that this trend will abate’ (pp178). This ‘elephant in the drawing-room’ calls Altbach’s attention away, in part, from discussing the worldwide place of tenure as such.
God, Mies van der Rohe said, is in the detail. The detail in The Questions of Tenure calls into question some of the anti-tenure premises laid out in Chait’s scene-setting chapter called ‘Why Tenure? Why now?’ (pp6-31). He argues there that the success of higher education in the past generation (in that more people aspire to it, and are getting it) has ‘shifted tenure’s relative position’ (pp18). This because growth in numbers of faculty has been greatest in two- year colleges, part-time and non-tenured positions, and professional schools. In all these places tenure is less likely to be available than in public and private research universities and doctoral institutions. And then there’s the for-profit sector: ‘the word [tenure] has no place in the vocabulary or personnel policies of for-profit vendors’ (pp22). So the University of Phoenix is the irresistible force destined to rout the AAUP and sweep tenure out of American colleges? We’ll see.
