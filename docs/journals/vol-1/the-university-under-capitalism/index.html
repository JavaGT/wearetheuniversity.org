Indeed, if there is one thing that is at home in the practice of actually existing universities then it is contestation. Yes, the university has historically been the locus for projects of the formation of national culture, for exclusion and the promotion of sectarian interests, the certification and acculturation of elites. But the university is also much more than that. As we have seen through history, and again in the most recent riots and occupations in Greece, Britain and Chile and in the actions currently underway at Auckland, Wellington and Dunedin, the university can be and is being contested.</p><p>What is today being contested is the promise of the university, and our sense that this promise is being dashed against the rocks. To fathom what the promise is, I propose to evoke a text by Jacques Derrida that he presented in several forms in the years prior to his death, known as ‘The University without Condition’. In this text Derrida identifies the way that the modern university claims for itself the right to be without condition.</p><p>This university demands and ought to be granted in principle, besides what is called academic freedom, an unconditional freedom to question and to assert, or even, going still further, the right to say publicly all that is required by research, knowledge, and thought concerning the truth....The university professes the truth, and that is its profession. It declares and promises an unlimited commitment to the truth.1 Derrida is clear, however, that this profession of truth is a frustrated profession.</p><p>It works around a promise that is always compromised. It never finally arrives, in pure and perfect actuality.</p><p>This university without conditions does not, in fact, exist, as we know only too well. Nevertheless, in principle and in conformity with its declared vocation, its professed essence, it should remain an ultimate place of critical resistance – and more than critical – to all the powers of dogmatic and unjust appropriation.2 The powers of dogmatic appropriation, I suggest, are as ever at the door today. Derrida identifies the state powers, economic powers and the powers of the media, those forces that threaten – because of the fact that they are threatened by – the reality of democracy. What is important is to recognise that the university is always conditioned. Today, it is being ever more conditioned by what we would be mistaken to call anything other than capitalism.</p><p>Capitalism is a fundamentally elusive referent. We do not need to read the New Zealand Herald or the National Business Review to sense that the elites that run this country do not have much of an idea about what capitalism involves. So let us be clear. Capitalism is not a regime. It is not an economic system that governs in certain countries and not in others. Capitalism is an inclination, a leaning or a tendency towards capital, towards ever expanding money, towards money which begets money.</p><p>Capitalism manifests itself in the university in a variety of ways. We see it, for example, in the rendering of students as consumers, something which presupposes a certain prior knowledge on behalf of students of the scope and content of what one will learn. Capitalism also introduces new and complex demands between teachers and students, above all the demand that student-consumers will pay.</p><p>The inclination towards capital is also visibly obvious in the opportunities for advertising increasingly targeted at students. We see this from the litter of advertising that fills open spaces in the university and finds its ways into the naming of lecture theatres and indeed entire buildings.</p><p>We see capitalism in the university in the increasing direction of research towards commercial purposes and support for research and the criteria for promotion towards the attraction of external research funding.</p><p>Beyond these visible symptoms, though, perhaps the most important dynamics of the subsumption of the university under capitalism occurs in the transformation of the categories through which one thinks about the purposes of the university, the participants in the university and those who might have a stake in the university. At base capitalism involves recoding the categories through which we understand the university. Capitalism involves coding the university as a machine for the production of as many functionaries as are required for the varying demands of industry, coding learners as receptacles to be filled until overflowing with useful knowledge and coding those who have a stake in the university as those responsible for the endless expansion of capital rather than as citizens who might participate in and benefit from a thoughtful, culturally vibrant, sustainable and just society.</p><p>Such a transformation does not take place overnight. It involves an often imperceptible shift that emerges very gradually, not through the application of a shock doctrine but through a gradual tightening of impositions and a gradual loosening of what were previously upheld as standards. This strategy of gradualism can come to a head, at a point at which a constant quantitative pressure produces what is later recognised as having involved a qualitative shift.</p><p>Of course the university can continue under capitalism, in name if not in concept.</p><p>But no matter how deplorable the situation is at present, capitalism, which is not a regime but a tendency, has not yet completed its game. If we look to the UK, where student fees have now risen to £9,000 per year and state funding for anything but the most narrowly conceived technosciences has been cut almost completely, then we can see one vision of the future. University administrators surely mean well when they seek to increase funding for the university, although when they complain that their hands are tied by the government this complaint seems to be motivated by a will to unleash the pure and relentless logic of capital on us all. This goes well beyond attempts to tamper with conditions in the collective contract, as it involves a fundamental realignment of priorities and the categories though which we evaluate those priorities.</p><p>I returned to the University of Auckland earlier this year after a dozen years in Europe, and have been again and again impressed by the ability, vitality and commitment of the student body. I hear the frustration of students, not merely about their debts, but about restrictions on content, the lack of space for critical interchange and beyond this their concern about the lack of participation in the governance of the university. I can also see what students promise. We could all walk out, whether to make a killing in the city, to head abroad with no intention of returning, or to establish a university elsewhere based on entirely different premises and principles. Such are options to us all. For my part, I propose that we stay, and we make this the kind of place that we collectively want it to be, for us and for future generations.</p><ol><li>Jacques Derrida, ‘The university without condition’ in Without Alibi, trans.
