As he attempted to enter, he was met with a restraining hand on his chest, and a threat to search through the pockets of his gown. While these actions are highly illegal, Tava was well within his rights. Within those pockets was not a bomb, a cellphone, or even a light snack for the anticipated stretch of seated applause. There was only a pile of yellow rosettes, which bore the logo and slogan of the TEU (Tertiary Education Union), asking students and staff to unite. Tava had intended to wear one pinned to his gown as he attended the ceremony, as a sign of support and solidarity. Yet clearly, the senior authorities of the university were so intent on suppressing the voice of this union that they were willing to prevent students from graduating in the process. This was a blatant violation of section 14 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act (1990), which states that “everyone has the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and opinions of any kind in any form.” However it also provided a revealing glimpse of a bullying and oppressive ethos currently bubbling behind the University of Auckland’s benign exterior of clouds and blue skies. The TEU and their supporters are fully justified in opposing Vice Chancellor Stuart McCutcheon’s proposed changes to employee conditions, not only as it diminishes their ability to do their jobs well and to provide a high standard of education, but it aligns the university with a more econometric, capitalistic model.</p><p>According to a media release from the TEU,</p><blockquote><p>The vice chancellor is demanding academics move a number of core conditions that are crucial to academics doing their job out of their collective agreement and into policy, over which they would have no control.</p></blockquote><p>This would mean that rights such as sabbaticals, fair promotion and disciplinary process would be most likely changed according to McCutcheon’s aims, as putting them into policy would mean they could be changed without any right to appeal. Academics would have less room to pursue their own projects, working longer hours and having to run their work by authorities. Such working conditions would also detract top overseas academics from the university. In a wider sense, this proposed restructuring represents what Vernon Tava referred to in a recent interview as “an increasing managerialism and corporatization of the university... a Fordist approach... a production-line, turning out the units, very autocratic management style”. In other words, by limiting the freedoms of academic workers and imbuing managerial positions with more power, the university becomes increasingly fitted to a knowledge economy. Research is subjected to institutional ownership; knowledge is no longer knowledge in and of itself, but an object which can slot into the network of others in capitalist discourse. It becomes an exchangeable, measurable, and profitable commodity, and is produced accordingly. As Vice Chancellor Stuart McCutcheon writes in his message to the public concerning the University of Auckland:</p><blockquote><p>Society is changing rapidly in ways which will have a profound impact on the role of universities... In a world where change is the norm, however, one thing is certain - knowledge will be a key resource and will be highly sought after within New Zealand and around the globe.</p></blockquote><p>McCutcheon’s message illustrates the understanding of knowledge as a corporatized product, which his proposed changes to academic employee conditions reflect. He refers to knowledge as a ‘key resource’ as though it were oil or diamonds; a phenomenon to be regulated and mass produced for economic profit.</p><p>This capitalistic vision seems to be what tertiary education is evolving into around the world. The recent near tripling of fees in the UK embodies a similar trend. According to the Guardian website, the arts and humanities (less directly profitable and profession- based subjects) will become increasingly inaccessible as a result of the government cuts. With these increases pushing working classes into more corporate, ‘profitable’ professions such as law, medicine, or business, the arts and humanities will inevitably become an in- dulgent leisure for the upper classes. As the necessity of subjects is increasingly defined by profitability, such vital subjects will risk losing their place in society.</p><p>What we should gravitate towards is a completely different view of knowledge. Philosopher and public intellectual Cornel West provides an important alternative perspec- tive. In a recent interview with Noel McCarthy, West articulated the way he sees his own academic practice as rooted in a calling rather than a need for a job, and his knowledge is therefore his own, to do with as he pleases – it is not the possession of the academic in- stitution. This is an important articulation of the real objectives of academics: they are not cogs in an assembly line, producing pre-designed knowledge for a higher power. They are undertaking their own research projects, investigating within their own fields of knowledge. This is a productive rather than re-productive process; it requires conditions which are conducive to its expansion and freedom rather than regulatory.</p><p>Ultimately, whether those conditions can be maintained is a reflection of the ob- jectives and roles of tertiary education. In West’s view,</p><blockquote><p>knowledge does not come in the form of pieces... [it is] couched within a larger wisdom, a wisdom rooted in a love and compassion... driven by a fight for justice for others... we must never confuse education with credentialization. (West, 37)</p></blockquote><p>While it sounds slightly sentimental, it is an example of a perspective which, if adopted, would validate a less corporate university. With this more fluid approach to the nature and purpose of knowledge, academic work (both under-graduate and post-graduate) should not simply be seen as a business transaction, but part of a wider, continuous and open process.</p><p>Works Cited: West, Cornel. ‘Profile of Cornel West’. droppingknowledge.com.
