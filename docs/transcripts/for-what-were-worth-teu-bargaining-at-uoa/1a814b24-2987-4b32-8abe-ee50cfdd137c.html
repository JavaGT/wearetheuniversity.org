To give you an idea of what this and eustra,</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="6000"><button>3s</button></td><td class="caption"> every episode is going to be like. We're going to lead with an update on bargaining. And if you keep listening, we'll continue on with an interview with a member on a topic relevant to our claims, bargaining or union issues more generally. We hope you find it informative and entertaining. I'm a member of the branch committee as you are under 35 representative and one of your team of both. Now we've got the introductions out of the way. It's time for our very first update on bargaining.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="9000"><button>6s</button></td><td class="caption"> So I'll be handing hibkiss, I'm a T.U.

This involves the unions write in a letter to the employer, which should by now be available to every person.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="12000"><button>9s</button></td><td class="caption"> potentially covered by the collective. These were sent out early this week on the afternoon of Tuesday, the 2nd of July. I think it's really positive that we unusually got straight into the first bargaining on Wednesday and Thursday of this week, the third and the fourth of July, immediately after initiation. Often there's weeks between initiation and start of the bargaining. I think,</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="15000"><button>12s</button></td><td class="caption"> thought it was really positive to get straight into the face-to-face negotiation meetings this year to do it so quickly and I really appreciate the work done by both sides advocates getting their teams organised so quickly. So there's four collective agreements for us to negotiate at Auckland Uni. Our team was quite a large one, even though the medical academics collective is going to be discussed separately.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="18000"><button>15s</button></td><td class="caption"> also saw both ETAE members and organisers as part of the team, representing their members in both the professional and insecurity and gardeners collectives.

After having our claims thoroughly endorsed by members with almost 100% of members voting in favour of the claims, we entered the first day with 27 claims across the three collectives that</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="24000"><button>21s</button></td><td class="caption"> were there to discuss. I won't sit and read through every single one of them because we did share the full claims document yesterday with TUE members by email. The highlights of our claims and possibly the claims that will generate the most discussion in the coming weeks are a 6% pay increase for all union members with no pass on to non-union members for six months.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="27000"><button>24s</button></td><td class="caption"> to the performance pay bans, so an effective and its restrictions and issues, removal of the bars from some academic scales, so that progression through the band is based on service, easier progression through the security and gardener scales, a nursing pay scale that brings our university employed nurses</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="30000"><button>27s</button></td><td class="caption"> We have claimed to increased-term agreements for transition to permanence and the reasons that are being given for employment being of a fixed-term nature. This also affects postdocs, as I claim for how they progress, is linked to certainty for all staff employed in relatively precarious work. Talking of which, the TUE also want casuals brought into coverage of the collective agreement.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="33000"><button>30s</button></td><td class="caption"> We've got many casual members who are currently excluded from such things as minimum pay rates and conditions in our collective agreements. We're also trying hard to get recognition in the collective agreement of Tiao Māori practices, knowledge and use of Tikanga and use Tareo headings in the collective agreement as well, as well as recognising the obligations that many Maori workers have to their Farno hapu and iwi, beyond those that</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="36000"><button>33s</button></td><td class="caption"> they also have to their employer. This brings the collective agreement into line with TUE values and also reflects really positively on the work that the university tries to do in this area. More technical claims include extended coverage beyond the current G band in the professional collective and removal of the exclusion of TU members from certain leaf policies that are administered by the university. I think possibly the biggest claim this year is going to be the</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="39000"><button>36s</button></td><td class="caption"> performance play and remove the current bands with step to progression based on years of service this provides far greater transparency for the for the pay system and better understanding of how you progress through the grade to to the top of the scale for your particular grade it's been shown time and again that this gives far greater satisfaction for workers helps recruitment helps retention</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="42000"><button>39s</button></td><td class="caption"> built into opaque performance pay-based systems. The employer presented their perspective on the current world economy and inflation conditions. We disagreed with their position that CPI reflects inflation pressures on our members.

We prefer when we're discussing our members' wages the household living cost price index, which better reflects the real expenditure based by households and has a much more robust data set than the CPI. The household living cost price index currently 6.2%. And this means that our pay claim very much aligns with current</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="48000"><button>45s</button></td><td class="caption"> way of a pay increase will very much depend on how staunch members are in support of their claims and their willingness to build union density by recruiting their non-member colleagues into the teu and eventually maybe to take action to drive home how important these issues and claims are to members. Overall the university has 26 claims and although many of these are repeated across each collective</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="51000"><button>48s</button></td><td class="caption"> There currently. There currently. Although, there has to be fiscal responsible, and it also depends on the overall package. They do prefer a three-year term for the collective agreement, while we've proposed a one-year term to better line up with other universities so that we as a union can better coordinate bargaining in the future. There are seven universities negotiating.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="54000"><button>51s</button></td><td class="caption"> in this year. AUT. WICATO, this year, and they've got a two-year term. Wicato had to take strike action to settle last year's negotiations. They've only just ratified a one-year term, which means that they immediately had to initiate again for the next collective agreement. So AUT will be missing out on this year's bargaining, but all universities are now</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="57000"><button>54s</button></td><td class="caption"> all except all have exchange claims. Our next at UOA have been set for Tuesday the 9th for security guard and gardeners and Wednesday the 24th for academic and professional collectives. There's going to be a small planned activity for members to undertake on the week of the 15th of July. It's important that we build membership and we start conversations on the bargaining and the claims.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="60000"><button>57s</button></td><td class="caption"> details of that exercise will come from the branch committee, Cheers, and now, one of our host, professional staff member and recent EU recruit, James Love, will be interviewing Sean Stern, an academic staff representative on our branch. James joined after our latest round of bargaining, and Sean has been a member since 2010, and they've been on the bargaining team since 2011. Sean and James will be chatting about the life cycle of bargaining, how bargaining works, how bargaining works,</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="63000"><button>60s</button></td><td class="caption"> team is composed and the team. I'll hand the table. I'll James for the interview. Sure, what's your history with the union? I was when I first came into the university, I was basically on kind of precarious contracts. I was sort of, I was helped out by somebody from the union and, you know, to get into a more permanent position at the right level and stuff. And so, and I thought, well, I've always been interested in union, so I would get</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="66000"><button>63s</button></td><td class="caption"> much as soon as soon as soon as soon, when I joined the branch and I've kind of been there ever since. And so that's involved not only being on the branch committee, but also bargaining because I was I was kind of interested in that. And so I got, I got initially dragged in, but then ever since then I've just been involved in it. So that's, you know, ever since about 2011 or 12, I think it was. So around about 10 or 11 years now that I've been doing the bargaining. This is my first time that the TEU is doing bargaining and I'm part of the</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="69000"><button>66s</button></td><td class="caption"> So for people like me. So, so, so, so, is to make changes to our academic and professional collective agreements. So basically that's the thing that we sign with the university, we implicitly sign when we sign that letter that says, you know, you have to be made a job offer. And the contract contains everything like a conditions of work.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="72000"><button>69s</button></td><td class="caption"> includes includes what happens if things, or the employer, the employer. If you're a union member, then you are part of what's called a collective, so everybody has basically the same conditions. If you're not a union member, you have something called an individual employment agreement, which basically ends up mirroring the collective, but maybe with a few tweaks to it. And what we do in bargaining is we're basically talking about changes to that, along with the basic</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="75000"><button>72s</button></td><td class="caption"> of what are you're going to get paid? So it's about pay and conditions, and it involves what can be quite a long and drawn-out process of negotiating with the employer who is the Vice Chancellor officially about what they want to offer and what we want to accept and also the changes that both of us want. So if it's quite a long and drawn-out process, how long does it usually take? Well, in most cases, we normally initiate, which means to sort of</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="78000"><button>75s</button></td><td class="caption"> proposed that bargaining begin. Ideally, we've by the by the year, but sometimes it drags on. So sometimes we've had it drag on for up to almost the middle of the following year. And partly that's because the process is involves lots of towing and throwing. You know, people sort of making claims, amending claims, withdrawing claims, sometimes action, you know, so the union will take some sort of industrial action. And so that drags things out. I think last year we, you know,</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="81000"><button>78s</button></td><td class="caption"> initiated in about July and we finally we finally the union members the with the contract in about March I think and so it was a it was a it was about a seven or eight maybe nine-month process so it can you can take quite a long time. Josh, okay. Why do we usually start it in mid-year? Is there anything that goes into deciding when we begin bargaining? Oh, so what so what happens is the collectives run for a period of time. So the last one ran for two years. So that's that means that means that</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="84000"><button>81s</button></td><td class="caption"> you basically you basically, and then the contract or the period of and so last time it was two years. It's not always two years. Sometimes it's one year. I think once we had a three-year term and how long the term is kind of depends on strategic decisions people are making like are we in a time when inflation is going crazy and so we need to negotiate more often because people are not sort of certain about what it's going to be like in future.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="87000"><button>84s</button></td><td class="caption"> longer terms, longer terms, and it means that we're not they have some certain locked in. But sometimes if you agree to something ahead of time, and then there's kind of a change in the economic environment, it's not favourable or, you know, for the union members, because you've locked something in and in advance. And so the time varies. So it can vary. Usually it's around one, one to two years. Yeah, that'll be what it is this time too, I'm guessing. Yeah. So, yeah, we're not in an amazing economic circumstance. So it's been a roughly a short one this time.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="90000"><button>87s</button></td><td class="caption"> I think that's what will end up happening.! just to make sure that we're back at the table and we can kind of take into consideration the current economic circumstances. If everything is really stable, then obviously you can go longer. At the moment, things are a bit uncertain. And do we try to coordinate bargaining with other national members of the TEU? Yeah. Well, definitely, ideally what happens is we coordinate with other branches at other institutions because that means, I guess, we have.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="93000"><button>90s</button></td><td class="caption"> have it's. It's obviously, it's obviously, it's to have, and we're the bargaining process, then it's obviously better if we're all on the same time frame. So this year, I think there's a couple of institutions that have sort of lagged behind the others. And so we're going to try to line up again during the, you know, through this bargaining process so that we're all kind of initiating around the same time, bargaining around the same time, and the term is around the same. Is there a hard end day?</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="96000"><button>93s</button></td><td class="caption"> Right. So that existing collective actually expires before we can negotiate a new one, then what happens is everybody rolls, everybody stays on that, on that contract, but it's, but it officially becomes an individual employment agreement, right? So your conditions of employment don't change, but it ceases to be a collective, right?</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="99000"><button>96s</button></td><td class="caption"> for us to get the contract ends. The contract ends. after we start bargaining. That's like that's how it actually works. So we're sort of bargaining in advance, if you like. And if it runs out, then people go on to an individual collective but at the same conditions that they were on in their collective collective. Yeah. And then you have to negotiate a whole new collective agreement, which nobody wants.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="102000"><button>99s</button></td><td class="caption"> Exactly. So what. So what? So, right? So, right? So,! What happens, right? Okay. Well, so what happens, basically, is, is at the beginning of the process, everybody basically outlines their claims, right? So they say, these are the things that we have to bring to the table that we want changed in the collective. These are the proposals that we have for things like pay over the, over the period and so forth. Then what happens is that there'll be an initial process when somebody will come back and say, this is what we think. And then the others, then the people will answer. And it just basically goes back and forth, like,</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="105000"><button>102s</button></td><td class="caption"> that all the way through. Sometimes,! Sometimes, they're quite, relatively quickly. Sometimes, there'll be claims that they consider to be kind of core, and they will take longer to adjust or decide to drop those. I mean, last year, what happened is basically we negotiated on everything pretty much other than, other than pay. And pay was the last thing to sort of be tabled.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="108000"><button>105s</button></td><td class="caption"> And then, and then, because,! because there was, so that it, so that it, so that it benefited the more lower paid, paid workers, more than the more highly paid workers, and there was a bit of to and fro about, about how that would work. I think sometimes the employer comes in, so that, so the VC and their, their representatives come in and they want to pretty much say, this is how it is, this is kind of the best we can offer. We always find that things can, can, you know, be changed.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="111000"><button>108s</button></td><td class="caption"> if we, if we, if we, a bit, so just, right? So just, um, um, um, people, people, people kind of conceding or suggesting changes. Um, it isn't, it isn't always confrontational, right? So sometimes it's actually we are working together on something that we, but, we would both like. Um, so last time an example was the improved parental leave, um, provisions. And so basically, both of us were on the same wavelength with that. We wanted a better system. We wanted a system that was better for both,</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="114000"><button>111s</button></td><td class="caption"> partners. We wanted some! We wanted to and we wanted to permanent staff and so that process was kind of more negotiating what the best outcome might be for both of us. So it's not always confrontational. Sometimes we have things that we want to work on together in common. And does that decide by the bargaining team in the room or is there a different process for who decides that? Well, so what generally happens</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="117000"><button>114s</button></td><td class="caption"> is is, is, is the bargaining team has been! by the members at, to bargain on their behalf. And so what we do in conjunction with the, with the organizers, so we being the professional and academic staff members on the, on the bargaining team, we work with the, with the organizers to progress the bargaining. And then if we get to up to a point when we have something to bring back to members, so we have, you know, most of it decided, or we have</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="120000"><button>117s</button></td><td class="caption"> we've reached a bit of an impasse,! to members and say, are there are there we should be doing differently? How are you feeling about what we've brought out to you? Sometimes that's because we're really happy with it and we are happy for them to endorse it. So we'll come out and we'll recommend, you know, that they go ahead and endorse it. At other times, we'll come out and we'll say, look, we're not too happy with this, but we need your approval to kind of stick with what we had agreed to or to make these</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="123000"><button>120s</button></td><td class="caption"> suggestions to the employer and then we're what do you guys think. Are you're recommended? Basically, we keep going until we either happy or there's a kind of a stalemate, in which case we'll come out to people. When the whole thing is finished, then we'll come back out to people for a kind of an endorsement of the whole outcome. If it's not going well, you mentioned industrial actions before. Yeah. How do you decide</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="126000"><button>123s</button></td><td class="caption"> we're going to do these and what are the! when we can. Okay, if things don't go so well, and it looks as though we have to take industrial action and support of our claims, then we have to notify the employer that that's going to happen. So we have to, I forget exactly how much notice it is, but we have to say this is what's happening. And we also, obviously, that has certain impacts. Like, for example, if we take industrial action and it means not working, for example,</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="129000"><button>126s</button></td><td class="caption"> then that does mean that does usually during that period. you're only in bargaining, So you can't take industrial action under the current law outside of bargaining. You're obviously allowed to take it in support of bargaining, whether that's to get public support, whether that's to rally people behind the cause, whether it's to put pressure on the employer to come back to the table with different claims or revised claims. Those things can only happen during bargaining.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="132000"><button>129s</button></td><td class="caption"> and that it does require, we've, we've, we've, we've, we've! We've had one-day strikes. We've had different withdrawals of labour. So, for example, one year, we said that we weren't going to enter grades until we had some, some movement from the employer. We often do things like have rallies. Usually rallies are in, are in support of some other kind of more substantial action. I know when we're bargaining, we're bargaining for a lot of groups of people.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="135000"><button>132s</button></td><td class="caption"> covered by the! in the in the collective. in the Okay. we are bargaining for the academic collective, which is basically you know, lecturers, professional teaching fellows, research fellows, um, GTAs, you know, so tutors, graduate teaching assistants, also some, some senior tutors who haven't shifted to the PTF contract. That's the academic one. There's also a medical academic collective, which is, which is slightly different because the medical</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="138000"><button>135s</button></td><td class="caption"> not on the same collective as the other academics.! So that's, of different roles, everything from people working in libraries to people working in finance and so on. We're also bargaining for the gardeners and security collective. So that's all of the security guards around the university and the gardeners. There's another union that also bargains with us, which is the PSA, Public Service Association. So we're</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="141000"><button>138s</button></td><td class="caption"> We're bargaining for PSA people. We're bargaining for! We're bargaining for professional staff, bargaining for academic collective and the medical academic collective. So a whole bunch of people all in the room together. The employer actually prefers to bargain professional and academic staff separately, but what we do as a union is we have all of our academic and professional staff members at both our sets of bargaining because we believe that there's important interests that they</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="144000"><button>141s</button></td><td class="caption"> that they have in the same time. So, so, a professional, two teams, an academic staff bargaining team and an academic staff bargaining team, we tend to have our academic and our professional team go to both bargaining sessions. So sometimes the academic bargaining is conducted in a different way to the professional staff bargaining. So the academic staff bargaining, sometimes it feels like colleagues talking to colleagues, the professional staff bargaining, they often talk down to the professional staff, which is why it's so important for us,</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="147000"><button>144s</button></td><td class="caption">!!! and they can't, and they can't as they can't as they can, to the academic staff. And I think, you know, if you've watched over the last 10 years, how the bargaining has gone and how the university restructures and things have gone, professional staff have borne the brunt of a lot of the restructurings over the last kind of 10 years, I guess, because they sort of feel as though they can do that to professional</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="150000"><button>147s</button></td><td class="caption"> staff, whereas, and, and, and, and, and, and,! the ones who are, and, and, you know, you know, generating the rankings and, and, um, you know, like, interacting with students and that kind of stuff. So they tend to, to, um, you know, go tough on professional staff and not, and not go so tough on academic staff, which, you know, we find a bit, um, well, we find... I mean, that's why, that's why we're negotiating as one contract, right? Negotiating is one group for four contracts. Yeah, yeah.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="153000"><button>150s</button></td><td class="caption">! Yeah, because they know that,! will, the academic staff will go out on the professional staff of the professional staff of need be. And vice versa, but... Yeah, but I think we find ourselves, I think the academic staff definitely have more bargaining power, and so we tend to be the ones who have to use it in support of professional staff. What other thoughts go into how we put together our bargaining team? Oh, right.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="156000"><button>153s</button></td><td class="caption"> on the on the on the on the on the on the! and in the, and in the and in the academic bargaining team, I'm kind of qualifying as one of them more experienced people on that team. We like to to also have a have a mix of more senior people and and more junior people because we are representing a broad range of people and we need to be aware of the concerns of people, for example, who are who are new to teaching at the university as well as people who are more experienced. We need to</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="159000"><button>156s</button></td><td class="caption"> to make sure that we are, I guess,! so in terms of the, and also in terms of the in the university. In the final wash-up, that tends to be that we have sort of three or four people, a professional and three or four people for academic. And then we also have our organisers as well who are kind of there also to provide continuity because they've been involved previously in bargaining. And they tend to run the bargaining, and us guys are really there</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="162000"><button>159s</button></td><td class="caption"> in support in support of particular claims.!! And also to help them, And if you can't, what claims are you there to speak to this time? Well, I tend to speak to things that involve mainly academic concerns, obviously. I'm often more focused on the working conditions of academics, you know, so stuff that academics are concerned about, like research and study leave, or workload, or</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="165000"><button>162s</button></td><td class="caption"> the relationship.! because I understand that.!! So it's those are in professional staff and so on. So it's those kinds of things that are within my ambit of experience that I tend to focus on. I mean, I also have, because I've been there for a long time, I have a sense of the longer view as well, and so I sometimes get asked to speak to that. So what's happened in previous bargaining, how we've handled that process, the pay</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="168000"><button>165s</button></td><td class="caption"> kinds of things.!! for example, who's maybe, who's currently precarious staff, that it's obviously great to hear from them about those kinds of issues, because I've been in a permanent position for a long time. I was precarious initially, but I don't have the experience of being a precarious person currently. And so it's best for them to be able to speak to that.

I think. for people to be, for the context of bargaining previously. We were basically, we were basically just coming out of COVID. We had an extremely high inflation rate.

It's really, really good also for us to have people who can help with, you know, additional stuff. Like, for example, if we need people who can help</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="195000"><button>192s</button></td><td class="caption"> can look at financial matters, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,!
