<p>In the third episode of For What We’re Worth, we have an update from Andy Hipkiss and Nicole Wallace on the bargaining meetings in Late July. These sessions covered Academics and Medical academics, along with living wage and performance pay (tupu). Then, Oreen Almeida speaks with Paul Taillon, Senior Lecturer in History at UoA and former Auckland branch president for the TEU. Paul is a union historian and talks about the birth of unionism and its journey over the last one hundred and fifty years to the modern bargaining processes of today both in Aotearoa and overseas.</p> <p class="western"> Are you a member who makes less than the 2024 living wage of $27.80 an hour and wants to talk to us about what making the Living Wage would mean for you?

Andy Hippkis, before Orin Almeida talks to Paul Tayon about union history. So over to you, Andy. You're everybody, it's Andy Hippkis from the TUE. So we've been in bargaining again this week. We had a few hours with the employer the other day, focusing on academic issues this time, where we discussed postdocs and how they could be better aligned in the collective agreement</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="9000"><button>6s</button></td><td class="caption"> with research fellows. We discussed the bars made a strong argument that bars halfway up a pay scale are simply an artificial obstruction to reaching the top of that pay scale and anything above the bar is illusionary pay and not in reality pay for people. We talked about GTAs. We came very close to</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="12000"><button>9s</button></td><td class="caption"> through their pay scale. We had discussions on a few technical claims regarding how wage deductions are permitted by the employer. Annual leave use, particularly around Easter Tuesday and Christmas, which we've discussed is potentially two closed downs in a year. Leave plus and enabling T.U members to access leave plus.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="15000"><button>12s</button></td><td class="caption"> and how your leave is carried over from year to year. No agreement's been reached as yet on them. We also met yesterday, which was what, Thursday now. We met to discuss administrative and technical changes to the medical academics collective, which is largely an administrative task, but it is quite time-consuming. The first activity on the medical academic collective starts when we exchange claims on August</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="18000"><button>15s</button></td><td class="caption"> We're quite looking forward to that, though the medical academics do largely mirror the academics in that, but with their particular medical provisions. Next session is next week. We're going to have a presentation by the Living Wage Altiero movement, and we're going to listen to what they've got to say about the importance of the living wage,</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="21000"><button>18s</button></td><td class="caption"> minimum wage for those people who are right at the very bottom of our pay scales we're also going to be presenting to the employer our arguments for removal of performance based pay so this is tu-poo and there is a link in barry's update for you to add some too-poo stories to a little padlet that the branch is running at the moment but we don't agree with performance pay we've got some strong opinions on it let's just put it that way and we'd like to</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="24000"><button>21s</button></td><td class="caption"> from the collective agreement and replaced, as you're aware, with a stepped progression from the bottom to the top of the scale. We've also had a commitment from the university to make a pay offer next week at the negotiations there. The Auckland Unis, the very last one to actually make a pay offer. Everybody else has made pay offers between 1%, 1.5% at the bottom with Massey.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="27000"><button>24s</button></td><td class="caption"> up to 3% so far. Of course, nobody's even close to settling yet. We are running some report-back meetings at those who started bargaining earlier and we'll be running some for Auckland University members sometime in August. So keep an eye on your emails for invites. It's important as well if you can to join or assist the bargaining support network that's run by the branch. They're active in free areas.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="30000"><button>27s</button></td><td class="caption"> in communicating with members, data research to support the bargaining team, and organising action, again, to show support for the bargaining process. It's member-driven work. Also, if you're a member who makes less than the 2024 living wage of 2780 an hour, we do want to talk to you about what making the living wage could mean for you. There's a link for you to follow to contact</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="33000"><button>30s</button></td><td class="caption"> us in Barry's update. So have a look. We want everybody out there to start building the collective T.U voice at University of Auckland. And that means talk to your colleagues and talk to about the bargaining and get them to join the union. It's easy, peasy, lemon squeezy. Thanks a lot, guys. Organiser Nicole Wallace here. So following on from Andy's update, we have further collective bargaining</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="36000"><button>33s</button></td><td class="caption"> on the 31st of July. So that was bargaining for academics, security and gardeners and professional staff. Now the two big topics were living wage and performance pay for professional staff, often referred to as Tupu. Now with the living wage, we had some special guests, Taysa and Brad from Living Wage Aetura who gave a great presentation about what the living wage means,</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="39000"><button>36s</button></td><td class="caption"> different pathways to become an accredited employer and just how much it means to people to earn a living wage. And they were also joined by students for living wage and to EU member, Xavier Walsh. The other, you know, they were joined by Branch Under 35 rep and a brilliant professional staff member, Rosaria Price, who spoke very strongly on the</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="42000"><button>39s</button></td><td class="caption"> sorts of work that are paid under living wage. There's currently no universities who are accredited as living wage employers. So there's a big opportunity here for Wai Papata Tomatooro to put their money where their mouth is and to live their values, basically. However, they're running at a time to be the first because AUT, well not accredited, is already at the point where</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="45000"><button>42s</button></td><td class="caption"> none of their staff, and security, paid less than the living wage. So University of Auckland's got a bit of a way to go. Now, the employer did give a presentation about how there's only going to be about 100 staff earning under the living wage once the rate is lifted in September. They did not talk about contracted staff, though, and the cleaners are.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="48000"><button>45s</button></td><td class="caption"> contractors. So that's not very expensive to boost all those people up to living wage. They also said that the sorts of jobs people are doing are mostly, if they're earning under living wage are mostly starsher jobs, like materials assistant. Now some of our members have been doing these jobs for quite some time and they very much disagree with this assessment.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="51000"><button>48s</button></td><td class="caption"> as a living money. as a living money.! And to be a living wage, Now, the other big topic was, they still deserve a living wage. Now, the other big topic was performance pay for professional staff or Tupu. And if you've been following the updates, you will have seen that we've been collecting stories from members on our padlet online about</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="54000"><button>51s</button></td><td class="caption"> how people felt about Tupu,! and the overwhelming response was absolutely not. Feedback was really fantastic. So what we did is we took a bunch of the quotes anonymously and put that into a presentation for the employer. And we spoke to just how problematic the system is, how it's not motivating staff, and it's not transparent in fear, and what this leads to.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="57000"><button>54s</button></td><td class="caption"> to as people go, as people, which, to control budgets. We then we then discuss the union's alternative, which is a proposed debt-based system, which would be fair and transparent and support people working together, rather than this weird competition where you know there's only so many good performance rankings to go around. Now, the employer is</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="60000"><button>57s</button></td><td class="caption"> rep said. There was new to Tupu! which we found interesting. There was a suggestion that perhaps there's only 120 disgruntled staff from the employer's reps. Although we suspect that if they talked to their own professional staff, they would probably find it's a lot more than just 120 who responded to the padlet.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="63000"><button>60s</button></td><td class="caption"> The employer was also of the step-up-up-up-uped put forward by the union, although although some of that criticism suggested they hadn't really understood the whole claim. The employer questioned why the step-based system would be more of motivating than a performance system, but, as your team said, we know that the professional staff who work here, they've often chosen to work in the public sector. They care about education. They care about education.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="66000"><button>63s</button></td><td class="caption"> or they care, and to do, and too, is to do a process like Tupu. There was also a suggestion that performance pay was contributing to the professional staff having a lower gender pay gap than the academic staff. However, your team pointed out that this wasn't actually what the employer's data suggested, because if you look at only the permanent staff, the gender pay</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="69000"><button>66s</button></td><td class="caption"> gap for professional staff is around 20% and it's and that's because, and that's because once you take out the casual and fixed-term staff who don't have to do too-pooh as a rule, the pay gap in the professional staff gets dramatically bigger. Unfortunately, there was no update on a pay offer, which is what we're really wanting.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="72000"><button>69s</button></td><td class="caption"> team.! The centre, doing Paul Tayon. if one is not soon to go back to back meetings to members later this month. Coming up next, we have Orin Almeida talking to Paul Tayon, doing the important work of putting our current bargaining round into historical context. Because sometimes we can take unions and the right to bargain and strike a little bit for granted. But Paul, a University of Auckland-based labour historian, talks about how workers have to really struggle to get those rights we now take for granted.</td></tr><tr><td class="timestamp" data-value="75000"><button>72s</button></td><td class="caption"> and how, and how, the late 19th century, the first to legalize unions, but also regulate industrial action, encouraging workers to go through an arbitration process rather than strike, setting the groundwork for the bargaining process we have today.
