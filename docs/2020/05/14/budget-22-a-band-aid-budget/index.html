 &lt;p&gt;
     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budget 2020 made steps towards addressing student
</code></pre>
<p>financial hardship and barriers to tertiary education, but
it missed the critical opportunity to transform the tertiary
education sector for good.</p><p>New Zealand Union of
Students’ Associations (NZUSA) President Isabella
Lenihan-Ikin says “Budget 2020 is a step in the right
direction. However, the government has taken a band-aid
approach to addressing student hardship and the barriers to
tertiary education more broadly.”</p><p>There are three
components of the Budget 2020 that provide support to
tertiary students.</p><h2>$20 Million Tertiary Student
Hardship Fund</h2><p>One of the demands of the National
Student Action Plan on Covid-19 was a student hardship fund.
It is pleasing to see that the government has listened to
learners by delivering this much needed assistance to
alleviate student hardship.</p><p>Lenihan-Ikin says
“although this fund provides short-term relief to students
facing hardship arising from Covid-19, it does not go far
enough to address the long-term challenges of poverty,
financial insecurity and rising living costs that tertiary
students are experiencing.”</p><p>Donna, a full-time
nursing student and solo mother says that “this fund is a
drop in the ocean in terms of the financial support that is
required. I should not live in a state of poverty just to
get a qualification, that will ultimately contribute to the
delivery of health care in New Zealand.”</p><h2>Free
Trades Training and Apprenticeships</h2></p>

<div class="headline-right"></div>

</div></div>
<p>The government's
$1.6 billion investment in training and apprenticeships to
remove the cost of tuition fees, supports the governments’
movement towards a barrier free tertiary education. The
absence of age requirements upholds the value of education
being a lifelong passport to opportunity.</p><p>Lenihan-Ikin
believes that “the investment in trades training to
students of all ages is a step in the right direction. It
suggests that the government understands that the financial
cost of tertiary education is a barrier to
access.”</p><p>However, this $1.6 billion investment does
not alleviate the substantial week-to-week cost of being a
student.</p><p>Eastern Institute of Technology Student
President Andrew Lessells says “calls from learners to
increase student allowance and living costs and to adjust
the age thresholds to access StudyLink support, remain
unanswered.”</p><h2>Adult and Community
Education</h2><p>Adult and Community Education was defunded
by the last government, but today the Government committed
$16 million to invest in these programmes, creating
opportunities for people to upskill and retrain.</p><p>This
will be crucial for those who may lose or have lost their
job as a result of Covid-19, and will open up doors for
adults with families and existing jobs to continue their
education in a more accessible way.</p><h2>Missed
Opportunities</h2><p>Lenihan-Ikin says that “this Budget
missed the mark by failing to deliver sufficient ongoing
support measures for tertiary students in a time of
significant hardship and uncertainty, which are more
pronounced for already marginalised
communities”</p><p>“Despite their election promise, the
government has not reinstated the postgraduate student
allowance, and student allowances and loan weekly payments
remain at unliveable levels. Other existing caps on these
services which shut disadvantaged people out of education,
such as age restrictions and weekly limits, have not been
addressed.”</p><p>“We know that the only way the
government can truly support tertiary students is by
introducing a Universal Education Income / Te Rourou
Matanui-a-Wānanga. 5000 students have already called on the
government to implement this” Lenihan-Ikin
says.</p><p>Budget 2020 could have been transformative for
students and tertiary education. Instead, the government
delivered us a band-aid
budget.</p>
