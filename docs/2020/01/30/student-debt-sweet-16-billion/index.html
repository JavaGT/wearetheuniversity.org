 &lt;p&gt;
     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday 31 January the New Zealand Union of Students’
</code></pre>
<p>Association (NZUSA) will be commemorating the ‘sweet $16
billion’ of student debt in Aotearoa from 1pm outside the
electorate office of the Finance Minister Grant Robertson.</p>
</p><p>The commemoration will involve people sharing the impact
their own debt will have (or has had) on their future and
will include a cutting of the ‘sweet $16 billion’ cake.
</p><p>“The commemoration of the sweet $16 billion of student
loan debt in Aotearoa leaves a sour taste in the lives of
students and recent graduates who are burdened by their
student loan debt. Student loan debt deters prospective
students from undertaking tertiary study and prevents
graduates being able to advance their careers overseas or
buy a house” says NZUSA President Isabella Lenihan-Ikin.
</p><p>"Young people face an increasing need to become educated
at a higher level. Older people are facing increasingly
precarious work and are being pressured to upskill. Tertiary
education is no longer the educational extra for the wealthy
and academically inclined”.</p><p>"Student debt is held by the
young and old and is a problem that last long after they
enter the workforce. Debt doesn’t just affect University
students over their three-year degree. It affects students
studying in polytechs and industry training providers, it
affects graduates, academics, businesspeople, teachers,
doctors and builders”. </p><p>President of Tauira Pasifika Ali
Leota says “within our Pacific community I am seeing the
very impact of the barrier that student loan debt has on
people wanting to upskill and high school leavers. To ensure
that tertiary education is equitable, we must remove the
cost barriers that prevents us from achieving and serving
our
communities.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>ENDS</p><p></p><p><br>
