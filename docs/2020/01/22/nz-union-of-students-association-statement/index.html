             <b>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZ_Union_of_Students'_Associations">NZ Union of Students&#39; Associations</a></b></span></p>
<pre><code>     &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;The New Zealand Union of Students’ Association
</code></pre>
<p>(NZUSA) strongly supports the Green Party’s demands that
the Government restore the post graduate allowance before
the upcoming election.  </p><p>NZUSA believes that, by not
restoring the post graduate allowance, the Government has
broken their 2017 election promise. </p><p>NZUSA President
Isabella Lenihan-Ikin says, “post graduate students have
been betrayed by the Government’s inaction on restoring
the post graduate student allowance”.  </p><p>“We are
hearing stories from post graduate students across the
country who are having to work multiple jobs in order to
finance the cost of living whilst they study. Post graduate
study is a full-time commitment and having to balance
working is unfair and detrimental to their wellbeing.” </p>
</p><p>“The absence of a post graduate student allowance
also acts as a barrier to students wanting to begin post
graduate study, including those wanting to retrain or those
wanting to continue studying after completely an
undergraduate degree.” </p><p>MJ Kivalu, a Doctor of
Business Administration student at the University of Otago
is one of the students having to juggle multiple jobs to
whilst studying towards her doctorate.  </p><p>“My post
graduate journey has been a hard one in terms of trying to
balance work and study. When I started my programme, it
didn't qualify for doctorate scholarships with stipends
because it's a Professional Doctorate rather than a Doctor
of Philosophy. So I had to get a job to cover my expenses
while I studied in Dunedin. I needed money to cover rent,
power, internet, fees, printing, food and laundry costs.
I've been working two jobs since while studying, just to
cover my expenses.”

<p>“Using most of my time for
work has influenced my studies - I have less time and even
though my jobs are flexible, I still have to put in more
work for them in order to get the job done and get paid”
she says.  </p><p>“If the post graduate allowance was
reinstated, I wouldn't have to work - I could use my time to
actually work towards my thesis. I wouldn't have to stress
about bills and food. The government still hasn't reinstated
the post graduate allowance, but the cost of tertiary
education or living costs in New Zealand hasn't decreased
either. It feels like New Zealand is purposely turning into
an elitist country, that I can't afford to stay in even
though I'm a New Zealand citizen.” </p><p>NZUSA
President Isabella Lenihan-Ikin says, “the reinstatement
of post graduate student allowance is a vital step towards a
barrier free education for all New Zealanders.”
