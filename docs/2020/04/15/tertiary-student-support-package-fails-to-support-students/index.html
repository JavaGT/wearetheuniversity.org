     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tertiary students across Aotearoa New Zealand are
</code></pre>
<p>disappointed by the Governments COVID-19 tertiary student
support package announced on 14 April. Students are finding
themselves in desperate situations due to the culmination of
insecure housing, employment, income and study</p><p>“The
announcement yesterday fails to meet the hardship needs of
tertiary students. Not only does the increase in course
related costs force students to take on additional debt,
students are unable to put course-related costs towards rent
and food costs, despite these being the main areas of
student hardship” says NZUSA President Isabella
Lenihan-Ikin.</p><p>She says, “students remain the only
group in society that are forced to borrow to live during
this period of uncertainty.”</p><p>Forty-four students’
associations across New Zealand have supported the National
Student Action Plan on COVID-19, which focuses on
implementing a Universal Student Allowance.</p><p>NZUSA
President Isabella Lenihan-Ikin says “This is the time
that the Government needs to ensure that students are
encouraged to remain in their studies by alleviating the
week-to-week financial hardship that students face. The
Government needs to get real about the financial insecurity
students
face.”</p></p>
