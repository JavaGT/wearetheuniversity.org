     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheduling of exams at the University of Otago on
</code></pre>
<p>Election Day comes as a huge blow to voting accessibility
for tertiary students. While New Zealand employers are
required to give their employees time off to cast a vote,
students have been afforded no such protection from their
study obligations and exam preparations.</p><p>“Tertiary
students have one of the lowest turnouts of voters in
General Elections, and making voting more accessible is
critical to improving democratic participation” says NZUSA
Vice President Sam Smith.</p><p>“While we acknowledge the
constraints that COVID-19 is placing on tertiary education
providers around exam timetables, providers should be
partnering with student representatives to support electoral
engagement amongst their students.”</p><p>“It is
pleasing to see that the University of Otago and OUSA have
already taken steps to mitigate the issue by upscaling
communication with affected students and the wider student
body around accessible options for voting. This includes
details about the multiple voting booths and advanced voting
options on campus.”</p><p>Other tertiary providers around
Aotearoa should learn from the University of Otago’s
mistake and ensure that their exams do not fall on Election
Day, in order to protect and promote the integrity and
accessibility of our democracy for all
voters.</p></p>
