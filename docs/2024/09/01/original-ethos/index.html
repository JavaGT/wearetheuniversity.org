We believe the University should function as the ‘critic and conscience of society’ and as an open space for expression of dissent. The escalating profit-driven and market-oriented agenda of the University over the last thirty years has eroded these principles.</p>
<p>We are committed to reclaiming the University, we believe in
Free, accessible, and quality education
Political freedom, and democratic governance of the university
No privatisation of education
Education and research should be driven by the needs of people, not the interests of the market. Management is not the University. Students, academics and workers all make this place what it is, and the truth is <strong>we are not a product of the university,</strong> WE ARE THE UNIVERSITY!</p>
