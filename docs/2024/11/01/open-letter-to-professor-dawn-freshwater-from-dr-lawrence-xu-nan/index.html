This is in direct violation to one of the core values, Respect and Integrity, of the University&#39;s Strategic Plan Taumata Teitei. In the consultation submissions to the Review Committee on the merger of faculties, both staff and students are highly concerned in areas such as dilution of disciplines, the reduction of representation for these disciplines on university committees and elsewhere, and the loss of academic diversity in the institution if these faculties are merged. These concerns must be factored into the decision-making process. The University has consistently used the reduced number of students as the rationale for the merger, without factoring in the University initiated reduction of academic and professional staff in the three affected faculties over the last decade. It is then unsurprising that there would be a reduction in student numbers when there are fewer courses being offered in the first place. The consultation that was done on the faculties&#39; merger pre-empted the outcome and only highlighted the pros and none of the cons, whilst leaving staff and students little room for negotiation. For example, the option to explore innovative ways to keep the status quo was not seriously entertained. This is not, in the words of Taumata Teitei, enabling our people and culture.</p><p>The proposed reduction in the number of courses offered across the University to save money and reduce pressure on timetabling new courses is even more troubling, both in its approach and speed.</p><p>The fact that the Senate passed an unprecedented emergency vote to pause it the proposal should be treated seriously and must give the University Executive Committee cause for reflection The fact that the &#39;course optimisation&#39; process has been simply passed on to faculties for implementation will reduce opportunities for further oversight by the Senate and consultation with staff. There is a concern that the University Executive Committee is placing financial performance above all other priorities within Taumata Teitei and thus foregoing its role and objectives as an institution of teaching<br>and learning.</p><p>There is an expectation of senior leadership of the University, as a public institution and as public servants, to uphold transparency and good governance practices. Based on what we have heard from the staff and students most affected, there is little evidence of quality consultation thus far from the University Executive Committee. Therefore, I call on senior leadership to take the feedback of its staff and students seriously in any future decisions that it makes.</p><p>I hope to see procedures improved to uphold the mana of all staff and student voices at Waipapa Taumata Rau | University of Auckland. If I can provide any assistance as you update these processes, please let me know.</p><p>Naku noa, nā,</p><p>Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan<br>Green Party List MP<br>Spokesperson for Education<br>Doctoral alumnus of Waipapa Taumata Rau | University of Auckland</p></section><section class="footer"><ul><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></section></body>
