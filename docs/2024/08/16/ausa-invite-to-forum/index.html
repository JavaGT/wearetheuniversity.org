Auckland University Student Association
Attention: President, Alan Shaker
4 Alfred Street
Auckland CBD, Auckland 1010
Subject: Course cutting student forum, 22nd August 2:30 pm, HSB (B201) Foyer
Tēnā koe Alan,
Many students at Waipapa Taumata Rau – University of Auckland have concerns
regarding central University’s ‘accelerated “optimisation” and “rationalisation” related
to ongoing Curriculum Framework Transformation’ of courses and programmes
across the institution. In short, the student body has been left no choice but to
interpret central University’s actions as being ‘course cuts’.
We intend that a student-led open forum be held on Thursday, 22 August, 2:30–
3:30 pm, in the foyer of the new HSB building (Level 4, B201). We expect the
attendance of the Provost (Valerie Linton or her direct representative) and other
decision-makers that central University management deems appropriate.
We shall invite all students and staff across the University community to attend. In
good faith, we would like to cordially invite AUSA to co-host this forum with us in the
hopes that we can work together on this matter of grave importance to our
community.
Many University community members have expressed immense concern regarding
the lack of communication between central University, AUSA, and the wider
University community. This has resulted in feelings of anxiousness, confusion and, at
times, indignation en masse.
The purpose of this forum is to provide an opportunity for affected community
members to better understand the rationale behind these changes. Such changes
have not been well-expressed by central University governance regarding this
‘optimisation’ and ‘rationalisation’ process.
As AUSA has championed, the Student Charter enables and entitles students to
partnership in decision-making, consultation and feedback regarding University
changes. We hope that AUSA and central University management see in full the
obligations and duties of the Student Charter.
It should be noted that should the Provost not attend our meeting on Thursday, we
shall take proportionate action to these course cuts at Mānawa Mai—the University
open day on Saturday next week (21 August)—by ‘providing respectful and
constructive feedback’, as per the Student Charter. We simply wish for student
voices to be heard and potential concerns alleviated.
We hope that AUSA shall agree to co-host this event with us next Thursday so that
we may further organise around this issue. We look forward to hearing from you in
due course.
Naku noa,
Nā Concerned Students
