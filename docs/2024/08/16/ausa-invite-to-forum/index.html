In short, the student body has been left no choice but to interpret central University’s actions as being ‘course cuts’. We intend that a student-led open forum be held on Thursday, 22 August, 2:30– 3:30 pm, in the foyer of the new HSB building (Level 4, B201). We expect the attendance of the Provost (Valerie Linton or her direct representative) and other decision-makers that central University management deems appropriate. We shall invite all students and staff across the University community to attend. In good faith, we would like to cordially invite AUSA to co-host this forum with us in the hopes that we can work together on this matter of grave importance to our community. Many University community members have expressed immense concern regarding the lack of communication between central University, AUSA, and the wider University community. This has resulted in feelings of anxiousness, confusion and, at times, indignation en masse. The purpose of this forum is to provide an opportunity for affected community members to better understand the rationale behind these changes. Such changes have not been well-expressed by central University governance regarding this ‘optimisation’ and ‘rationalisation’ process. As AUSA has championed, the Student Charter enables and entitles students to partnership in decision-making, consultation and feedback regarding University changes. We hope that AUSA and central University management see in full the obligations and duties of the Student Charter. It should be noted that should the Provost not attend our meeting on Thursday, we shall take proportionate action to these course cuts at Mānawa Mai—the University open day on Saturday next week (21 August)—by ‘providing respectful and constructive feedback’, as per the Student Charter. We simply wish for student voices to be heard and potential concerns alleviated. We hope that AUSA shall agree to co-host this event with us next Thursday so that we may further organise around this issue. We look forward to hearing from you in due course. Naku noa, Nā Concerned Students Relevant sections of the Student Charter are as follows: [The Student Charter] outlines the roles and responsibilities of staff and students.
