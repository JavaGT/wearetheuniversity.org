In short, the student body has been left no choice but to interpret central University management’s actions as being ‘course cuts’. As a sign of good faith and to help alleviate anxiety, confusion and, at times, indignation from across the University community, we would ask that you attend a student-led open forum. As the Vice-Chancellor’s academic representative, we would appreciate your attendance and cooperation in our hosting of a forum on Thursday, 22 August, 2:30–3:30 pm, in the foyer of the new HSB building (Level 4, B201). Regardless of your attendance, we shall be inviting all members of the University community to attend this event and have signalled to the AUSA our desire to co-host as a sign of unity. We respect AUSA’s role of representing the student body in consultation and decision-making with the University. It is our intention to show unity as students and ensure a productive discussion regarding potential mass changes to curriculum, teaching and learning outcomes. The purpose of this forum is to provide an opportunity for affected community members to better understand the rationale behind these changes. Such changes regarding this ‘optimisation’ and ‘rationalisation’ process have not been well- expressed by central University governance. The Student Charter guides and informs our letter to you, and any future actions that may occur due to the University&#39;s central management decision-making processes. We feel that you have not fulfilled your role in ensuring partnership in decision- making, including acknowledging and acting consistently with Te Tiriti o Waitangi. It will negatively impact Māori and Pasifika students, staff and the broader community if many of the courses in scope are eventually cut. We recognise that interpretations of the Student Charter are at times hotly-debated; such time would be better spent engaging in meaningful consultation and collaboration with students and staff. Your attendance at our hui would be most appreciated to ensure this. It must be noted that should you decide not to attend our meeting on Thursday; we shall take proportionate action to these course cuts at Mānawa Mai—the University open day on Saturday next week (24 August)—by providing respectful and constructive feedback, as per the Student Charter. We simply wish for student voices to be heard and potential concerns alleviated. We aim to ensure meaningful and constructive dialogue regarding an issue of mass importance to the student body, University community, and tertiary sector as a whole. We look forward to hearing from you in due course. Naku noa, Nā Concerned Students. Relevant sections of the Student Charter, as follows: This Student Charter sets out the principles underpinning the relationship between you and the University of Auckland. It recognises the expectations you have of the University, and in turn, that the University has of you. Our University is a research-led community of teaching and learning. A community of teaching and learning, however, is about more than just the pursuit of higher education. Our University is here to enable you to develop the skills, values and attributes to be active contributors and leaders in our diverse society; to understand and respect the significance of Te Tiriti o Waitangi; and to engage with opportunities to enrich yourself and others.
