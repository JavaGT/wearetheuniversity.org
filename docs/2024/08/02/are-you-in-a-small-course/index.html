<p>UPDATE (12/08/24)</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your response to our form.</p>
<p>You can access what students have to say about their small courses on a small site we have put up. We encourage you to share it with your friends and colleagues. <a href="https://burn-it.github.io/Disorientation/small-classes/">https://burn-it.github.io/Disorientation/small-classes/</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdW07auSdxHTxcMeKGUPKm22f01GZmb89m9npvpDcsLnp1JYQ/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdW07auSdxHTxcMeKGUPKm22f01GZmb89m9npvpDcsLnp1JYQ/viewform</a></p>
<p>That these voices will encourage and support those who will go up to defend these classes behind the closed doors of the university. You can&#39;t imagine what this means for someone who is trying to make a case for these courses – particularly when their livelihoods depend on them.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>An Open letter from Arts postgraduate students regarding the proposed review of small courses:</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/dxrebMg6afZoAyHr5">https://forms.gle/dxrebMg6afZoAyHr5</a></p>
<p>&quot;Kia ora,</p>
<p>We, postgraduate students in the Faculty of Arts, strongly object to and oppose the proposed review and cuts of smaller courses.</p>
<p>We find the lack of transparency around this issue to be disrespectful and dismissive, as is the consistent lack of communication and good-faith engagement with student concerns.</p>
<p>We are told repeatedly that the University wants to provide a world class education to all its students. Yet, over the last few years, the opposite has felt true in practice. Faculty funding has been cut, support and teaching staff have been overworked and underpaid, smaller departments have been shrunk even further, and student-driven approaches to learning have been undercut or minimised in favour of models that seem to prioritise profit over educational outcomes. These proposed cuts fall squarely within this pattern, and yet go further by threatening the very things that make the diverse range of programmes on offer worth taking– the courses themselves.</p>
<p>The proposed cuts of postgraduate courses with under 30 students threatens the bulk of the courses that make up postgraduate study in the Arts faculty. Not only this, but it reveals a misunderstanding of the value of small-course teaching at this (and indeed, any) level of teaching. Many studies have been done that reveal how student experience and educational outcomes improve in smaller learning environments; anecdotal evidence further supports this idea day-to-day. Indeed, it seems self-evident to state that students learn more effectively when teachers can easily connect with students, and students are better able to engage with each other.</p>
<p>Testimonials from students on the value of our smaller courses: &#39;Most of my undergrad and my postgrad has been in smaller courses, both in and outside of Arts. I’ve always found that everyone feels so much more comfortable when we’re in a smaller group, and so discussions get off the ground faster and more people share their opinions. I don’t think I’d have had nearly as good of a uni experience if my classes were all massive.&#39;</p>
<p>&#39;A part-time mature student balancing post-graduate study with full-time mid-career work, I have found the intimacy of my small group history course integral to revitalising my professional practice. At the heart of this are the insights and challenges afforded by discussions with both the professor and my classmates, particularly the perspectives of a younger generation of scholars as we tackle nuanced and complex ideas together. The sharpened approach I have gained to critical thinking about complex ideas has been directly applicable to work I am doing this year as my organisation considers its data strategy and the ethical use of generative AI tools in the New Zealand public sector context.&#39;</p>
<p>&#39;One of the reasons I was drawn to pursuing postgraduate study at this university was the smaller course sizes. Having 200-300 people per course in most of my undergraduate courses was always overwhelming and quite impersonal. My postgraduate study has been my favourite period of study at the university, as the smaller class sizes have enabled my cohort to develop close bonds with each other and with our professional teaching staff. These proposed reviews and cuts would severely undermine the quality and appeal of postgraduate study at the University of Auckland.&#39;</p>
<p>&#39;Small courses are the backbone of this faculty. And this faculty has proven it&#39;s worth time and time again with high enrolments (high profits). I think it&#39;s worth giving us the time of day to hear our views on this concerning development. All of my courses I have taken as part of my MA have been smaller than 30 people, and that has been to my benefit as well as the benefit of my peers. Our courses at present allow us to engage with each other, build confidence, and make lasting friendships. This is something that is impossible to achieve in larger courses and is half the reason I even chose to do my MA at UoA in the first place. Our best and brightest choose to study at the University of Auckland because of its prestige and reputation. We have some of the best staff members, some of the most interesting courses, and some of the most passionate students. If the University goes ahead with planned cuts, it will lose that prestige and reputation that it prides itself on. It will undoubtedly lose staff. It will undoubtedly lose students. How can the University say it wants what&#39;s best for its students when it won&#39;t even consult with us? When it won&#39;t be upfront and transparent? It&#39;s a shameful way of going about it, and I hope those in charge take our views to heart. Bring us to the table and give us the voice we deserve.&#39;</p>
<p>&#39;Small courses have been incredibly valuable to my educational journey, offering far more than just academic content. These courses, often centred around salient and specialized topics, create an environment that fosters deep intellectual engagement and meaningful connections. The more personal setting allows for greater interaction with both lecturers and peers, enriching the learning experience through collaborative discussion and shared insights. In many ways, academia thrives as a community, and small courses are the heart of this communal spirit. They provide a unique space where ideas can be freely exchanged and relationships can be built, reinforcing the collaborative nature of scholarship. The potential loss of these courses would not only diminish the richness of the academic experience but also threaten the very sanctity and spirit of the academic institution.&#39;</p>
<p>&#39;The proposed course cuts would essentially eliminate my entire degree, both at an undergraduate and postgraduate level. My studies at UoA have been almost entirely composed of small courses, in departments which have already been subject to significant funding and course cuts irrespective of the proposed changes. I was drawn to an Arts degree in my chosen subjects because they are more than just areas of study to me- they are life-long passions, and have in turn enabled me to find a similarly enthusiastic community of friends and fellow scholars within and beyond the university. Under the proposed cuts, the amazing experience I have had throughout my time at university would be completely unavailable to future students. Even with some curriculum or department changes, e.g. merging departments, there is no guarantee class enrolment numbers would meet the new thresholds of minimum 60 students for undergrad and 20 for postgrad. Alternatively, if they did, this would have detrimental effects on classes which are best suited for smaller numbers, especially in a seminar-style postgraduate setting which relies on student contributions and discussions. This additionally risks the loss of staff who have been inspirations and mentors to me and to countless students, and who are leaders in their respective academic fields and sub-fields. These cuts are short-sighted, ill-conceived, and would hurt students and staff throughout a wide range of subjects; I implore those responsible to reconsider.&#39;</p>
<p>We believe that small courses are the backbone of the tertiary education that we pay for. A course generating less than a set number of enrollments does not mean that that course is not essential for the people taking it.</p>
<p>If it goes ahead, cuts to small courses will have significant negative impacts on the learning outcomes and experiences of students over the coming years.</p>
<p>We request: That the University is more transparent in its communication and makes an official statement regarding its current plans for the proposed review and cuts That the University begins official consultation with students and staff that takes proper account of concerns and allows for alternative proposals to be made That the University explores alternative avenues to address the current budget deficit that will have less negative impacts on the important diverse course range available.&quot;</p>

<p>(09/08/24)* Statement from the AUSA:</p>
<p>&quot;Kia ora koutou,</p>
<p>AUSA has been made aware of the recent review of smaller courses at the University, particularly within the Faculty of Arts. It was brought to our attention that courses under a certain number of enrolments were potentially being scrapped. This, no doubt, causes significant concern for the student body and is something that requires immediate attention.</p>
<p>This is a rapidly moving issue and since being made aware of it early this week, we have been engaging with several concerned students and student leaders, and also requested an urgent meeting with the University leadership to outline our concerns and the concerns of many students.</p>
<p>We have been given reassurances that this “review” does not mean that courses under a certain number of enrolments will be automatically scrapped. We have also been given reassurances that the University is committed to protecting these smaller majors and disciplines, and wants to maintain its comprehensive offering of courses with humanities, and consideration will be given to protecting these programmes and courses. We have also been assured that students currently enrolled will not suddenly have to change their majors to accomodate any changes if they arise. Our concern was strongly relayed and we also urged the University to ensure that student consultation (both through AUSA and the individual Faculty Student Associations) is a central consideration to any decision-making.</p>
<p>To be clear, AUSA is vehemently opposed to the cutting of smaller courses and will remain a strong advocate for the protection of our smaller disciplines. We will continue to monitor the situation closely, continue to voice our concerns, and work to take appropriate action.</p>
<p>We will also continue to keep you updated about any developments that happen in this space. In the meantime, concerned students can directly reach out to us to provide any feedback, which we will voice to the University.</p>
<p>Ngā mihi,</p>
<p>AUSA Executive&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-ZsZ2tS8TF/">https://www.instagram.com/p/C-ZsZ2tS8TF/</a></p>
<p>Are you happy with this statement and their plan of action? Forward your thoughts to the AUSA.</p>
<p>++++++++++++</p>
<p>UPDATE (08/08/24) The AUSA President has told me that we can expect an official statement from them sometime in the next 24 hours, so be on the lookout for that.</p>
<p>The following link provides letter templates you can use in your correspondence to UoA leadership. These were prepared by students.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ukanTEPdiZYfjcGfVzffIIqIrAflCA6gyxtI5LOI2CM/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ukanTEPdiZYfjcGfVzffIIqIrAflCA6gyxtI5LOI2CM/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>Sorry, the next couple of bits are more relevant to Arts students.</p>
<p>An Arts Faculty staff member has suggested we also email the following UoA senior leadership with our feedback: Adrienne Cleland (Deputy VC of Operations), the Faculty of Arts Dean (Greg Booth), and Deputy Dean (Lindsey Diggelmann).</p>
<p>According to the UoA Arts Instagram page Deputy Dean Lindsey Diggelmann is holding a Student Voice morning tea next Tuesday (13/08/24) in the B201 Learning Lounge to have a &quot;casual chat... and share your experience as a BA student!&quot;</p>
<p>I will be attending to put some pointed questions to him and it would be great if others come along to do the same.</p>
<p>Go to the Instagram post for more details and to find out how to register for the event.</p>
<p>+++++++++++++</p>
<p>UPDATE (07/8/24) As well as emailing your feedback as stated below, you can give feedback via the following Google document.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1e6EGrVIcw45QqEnp5ItxOZAKFjIk2zTBH4wAy2SXrqQ/prefill">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1e6EGrVIcw45QqEnp5ItxOZAKFjIk2zTBH4wAy2SXrqQ/prefill</a></p>
<p>This form is a student initiative, not associated with the AUSA or the UoA. Responses to this form will be collated and forwarded to the AUSA and UoA.</p>
<p>Please forward the link to those in your courses. Graduates are welcome to provide feedback via this form as well.</p>

<p>UPDATE! (05/08/24) I had a meeting with the AUSA today. They received some information this morning from the UoA, as part of a routine Student Consultative Meeting, but after reading the excerpt below and the feedback received from students thus far, they have identified inconsistencies in the information provided in the SCM meeting and the email sent to staff. The AUSA has requested a meeting with the Provost to get clarification as to what the UoA is actually planning to do and what this &quot;set of pre-determined criteria&quot; is. A decision will be made as a result of the meeting as to what action the AUSA will take as a result. They will update me and I will update you.</p>
<p>In the meantime, continue to send feedback to your class reps., to the AUSA, or directly to the UoA.</p>
<p>The feedback deadline can be disregarded as it relates to a staff meeting being held on Wednesday.</p>
<p>At this stage there are approximately 50 courses that meet the under 60 criteria and could potentially be cut!</p>
<p>+++++++++</p>
<p>I am a class rep. for a small course and received this email from a staff member today -</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday staff got an email from the Acting Dean saying that the university’s leadership is asking for much more drastic action. This is an excerpt from that communication:</p>
<p>In brief, CFT and University leadership through PDDC (the Provost, Deans and Directors Committee) have presented plans for the accelerated “Optimisation” or “Rationalisation” of courses and programmes across the institution. This has significant implications for what we do.... All Faculties have been asked to review all small courses and programmes with the expectation that some cuts will be made, based on a set of pre-determined criteria. Undergraduate courses with enrolments below 60 are “in scope”. (Concurrently taught Stage 2/3 courses count as one.) Small postgraduate courses and programmes are also under review. This does not mean that all small courses will automatically be cut, but it does mean that we need to think innovatively about how to reshape our curricula so that we offer fewer courses in a given year. We must act extremely quickly to reduce the number of courses we are teaching, certainly for 2026; but if disciplines wish to review 2025 offerings with a view to making reductions, this will be viewed favourably.   We understand that this only adds to the general level of uncertainty that we all face at the moment. We are assured by University leadership that this initiative is driven entirely by curriculum priorities, timetabling difficulties and workload concerns, and is in no way intended as a means of reducing staff. As we have said throughout this process, our own focus within the Faculty has been to protect subjects and to protect jobs, and we will continue to do the best we can to meet those goals.</p>
<p>...We don&#39;t have much detail about how it will be actioned or what criteria will be used to protect subjects and courses with small enrolments, but we are committed to protecting the academic integrity of the programmes we offer as far as possible within the institutional directives.&quot;</p>
<p>Talk to your class reps. and start drafting feedback!</p>
