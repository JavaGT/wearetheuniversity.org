Please review the following resources before the meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/the-university/governance-and-committees/committees/senate.html">The role of Senate</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The Senate&#39;s <strong>statutory authority derives from the Education Act</strong>, which empowers Council to establish an Academic Board (in the case of this University the Academic Board is called Senate) <strong>to: Advise the Council on matters relating to courses of study</strong> or training, awards, and other academic matters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://burn-it.github.io/Disorientation/small-classes/all/">Student feedback regarding the pedagogical value of small courses (220+ submissions)</a></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I love small courses! They offer opportunities to build communities, engage with lecturers, and dive deeper into subject material through interactive class conversations and activities. <strong>I also feel more supported</strong> as a student when I&#39;m in a small course, because <strong>the lecturers care about me</strong>. This motivates me to attend class, put effort in on assignments, and engage more deeply and critically with course material.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;They were far and away <strong>my favourite courses</strong>. I <strong>learnt the most</strong>, <strong>connected with my peers and the academic staff</strong>, and felt the most deeply connected to the university. <strong>I would not have stayed</strong> studying here for so long if I hadn&#39;t had that connection. These courses were the norm for me in my language classes and my Classics classes beyond stage I courses, and <strong>they are the reason I loved my degree</strong>&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://padlet.com/teuuoacm/faculty-course-cutting-gxg4jh0vc4bxjlwu">Staff feedback regarding transparency, consultation and decision-making processes for the cuts (20+ Submissions)</a></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;As both staff and a student, I haven&#39;t been made aware of such changes until it leaked by people who heard third-hand what was going on, and even then <strong>it wasn&#39;t what was going on, because the administration hasn&#39;t made that clear</strong>&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;<strong>I do not feel fully informed</strong> and the student emails we receive are almost a copy/paste of the staff emails with <strong>no real explanation</strong> of the decisions being made&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Instead of coming clean and clarifying and setting the record straight about what&#39;s actually happening, faculty <strong>management has chosen to clarify things in meetings behind closed doors</strong> and not allay the (very real) concerns of rank and file students and staff. <strong>the students should NOT have to create a forum to demand answers</strong>&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;It&#39;s good that the uni (at this stage ...) is saying at least that they hope to protect Maori, Pacific and local content. However, little is known about WHO is making the final decision and on WHAT basis&quot;</li>
</ul>
