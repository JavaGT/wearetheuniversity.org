<p>SPECIAL EDITION: Praxis (Critical University Studies Reading Group #12)</p>
<p>Kia ora Koutou!</p>
<p>Special edition of reading group this week: Praxis ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Students are organising some political action, and it overlaps partially with our allotted reading-group time. I&#39;m providing support and I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll join me.</p>
<p>To consider for the reading materials this week (attached and linked, if you wish to look through) is what questions might be asked of the provost that could provide useful information or force them to reveal the reality of the things they are doing?</p>
<p>Of note is also an upcoming petition for AUSA to hold a Special General Meeting which will seek to make AUSA take a stronger position against the processes that the administration have used to accelerate the processes and avoid the usual checks-and-balances of the university in quite a Trumpian fashion.</p>
<p>Thursday 22/08/24 all-day-4pm (come whenever you can)</p>

Thanks for the readings attached and below, Java. It is so good (heart-warming actually) to see the student-led action on this issue. Iâ€™ll be there.</p>
