Did you not realise the numbers aren&#39;t adding up before or after <a href="https://teu.ac.nz/news/teu-seeks-tripartite-talks-again/">refusing to collaborate with the TEU to secure more funding</a>? Urgency leads to quick decisions, poor/no consultation, and decreased quality of core functions!</strong></li><li><strong>We are seeing a pattern of management fast-tracking process to avoid scrutiny and only justified by claims that, when examined say they made poor decisions and we now must suffer the consequences. How about we get management that doesn&#39;t make poor decisions?</strong></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Cuts to Courses</h2><ul><li>&quot;I think this refers to the work that PDDC Provost, Deans and Directors meeting has initiated just asking faculty to look at the portfolio of courses and programs.&quot;</li><li>&quot;I don&#39;t want anybody to think that we have asked for faculties to make wholesale large cuts to postgraduate courses.&quot;<ul><li><strong>No, just to prepare to have less on offer going forward.</strong></li><li><strong>Why not align this with the usual 3-year program review cycle? Is it a money concern? Clearly not because the provost kept repeating to students and staff at the open forum &quot;this is not about money&quot;</strong></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Commercialisation and Commodification of the university</h2><ul><li>&quot;We will firstly be looking at increasing revenues [from] working professionals [...] through our University of Auckland online platform.&quot;<ul><li><strong>Increasing revenue through online platforms shifts priorities and impacts traditional on-campus programs. So much investment in non-core funcationality and prioritising <em>human capital</em> over education.</strong></li></ul></li><li>&quot;This will result in UniServices being a much more agile and focussed organisation on innovation and commercialisation and business development.&quot;<ul><li><strong>Sounds like even less focus on education, non-profit endevours, and <em>even more</em> on commercialisation and putting pay-walls between the publicly funded research staff and students do and the public we are supposed to serve.</strong></li></ul></li></ul><h3>International Student Recruitment</h3><ul><li>&quot;Immigration New Zealand&#39;s rationale for increasing student visa fees by 90% is that it simply brings us up roughly to par with our main competitors.&quot;</li><li>&quot;So yes, it&#39;s disappointing that we&#39;ve increased our fees by that much, our visa fees.&quot;</li><li>&quot;We are looking forward to the next, the first priority coming through the internationalisation framework, being the international recruitment strategy.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The Australian cap is a bit misleading because it&#39;s taking them to pre-pandemic numbers in 2019, but what it&#39;s actually doing is it&#39;s an increase of 15% in 2025.&quot;<ul><li><strong>The increase in Australia&#39;s student cap concerns the Universty&#39;s international student market share, yet again viewing international students as cash cows rather than the campus-enriching, knowledge-sharing community they are.</strong></li></ul></li></ul></section></body>
