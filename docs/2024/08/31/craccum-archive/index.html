<li>INTERVIEW BY JACK ADAMS</li>
<li>FIRST OFF, HOW’D YOU GET THE NAME SHAKEY GRAVES?</li>
<li>Q&amp;A With Caleb from Broods
YOU’VE PLAYED AT SOME INCREDIBLE FESTIVALS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. WHICH ONE HAS STOOD OUT AS A - FAVOURITE, AND WHY?
YOUR BLUES-FOLK HYBRID MUST HAVE HAD SOME INFLUENCES OVER THE YEARS. IS THERE ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR YOU - LISTEN TO NOW, OR HAVE LISTENED TO, THAT INSPIRED YOUR SOUND TODAY?</li>
<li>AUCKLAND CITY LIMITS HAS ITS ROOTS IN MUSIC FESTIVALS IN TEXAS.
THIS MUST’VE CHANGED OVER THE YEARS. NAMES SUCH AS SHAPESHIFTER AND KENDRICK LAMAR ARE FAR FROM THE BLUES OF - THE NATIONAL AND YOURSELF.</li>
<li>THIS CAN’T BE A POSITIVE DIRECTION FOR MUSIC? IS IT NOT ABOUT THE MUSIC THESE DAYS?</li>
<li>HOW HAS BEING ON THE ROAD,TOURING ALL OVER THE WORLD, AFFECTED THE LYRICS/SOUND OF YOUR NEW MATERIAL?</li>
<li>WHO ARE YOU EXCITED TO SEE AT AUCKLAND CITY LIMITS?</li>

<li>Q&amp;A with MAALA

WE’RE VERY EXCITED TO SEE YOUR SET AT AUCKLAND CITY LIMITS, AND HOMEGROWN LATER ON IN THE YEAR. DO YOU - APPROACH A FESTIVAL SET DIFFERENT-LY FROM A SOLO GIG?</li>
<li>WHO WOULD HEADLINE AT YOUR DREAM FESTIVAL?</li>
<li>JUST BECAUSE WE’RE CURIOUS – WHERE DOES THE NAME MAALA COME FROM?</li>

<li><strong>INTERVIEW WITH THE MEDIA OFFICER - ZAVARA FARQUHAR</strong>
Why do you like asking people about their lives so much? Are you trying to live vicariously through them to - fill some kind of void in your own life?</li>
<li>So at least you don’t pretend that you’re doing law ‘for the community’?</li>
<li>Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Labour Party?</li>
<li>Really. Why.</li>
<li>Shoot, Shag, Marry – Kim Dotcom, Laila Harre, Hone Harawira</li>
<li>So you’re a racist gold-digger
What’s your stance on the US Presidential Election? Hillary or Bernie? Donald or Ted? Who’s going to win in - November?</li>
<li>Would you rather have as President of the United States? Donald Trump or Joseph Kony?</li>
<li>What do you think of the Pokemon I’ve assigned you?</li>
<li>What has been the most rewarding part of being on the AUSA Executive so far?</li>
<li>WHY SHOULD I VOTE IN THE AUSA BY-ELECTION?</li>

<li>Hey there! How are you?</li>
<li>Yeah I’m from Wellington, so I’m not very good with these places.</li>
<li>For this year’s Comedy Fest you’re performing “Valley of the LOLS”, is that right?</li>
<li>So your demographic audience is 24 year old women with anxieties.</li>
<li>So what have you learnt as a 24 year old woman?</li>
<li>Any shows you’re especially keen to see?
I just spent the entire morning watching sketches from Funny Girls... How do you come up with an idea for a - sketch?</li>
<li>So is Funny Girls coming back?</li>
<li>Have you been watching e Bachelor NZ?</li>
<li>Do you still keep in contact with Tim, Matt and Connor from U Live?</li>
<li>Have you had any awkward meetings with famous people?</li>
<li>I loved the interview with you and Amy Poehler.</li>
<li>is is your second time coming to New Zealand, right? So what have you learnt about New Zealanders?</li>
<li>Now what can we expect for your show at this year’s Comedy Fest?</li>
<li>Your face was used for the Internet Meme ‘Confused Muslim,’ what was that like?
Did you get people coming up to you like “Oh you’re that internet meme” and you were like “Noooo... I’m a - comedian...”
In your stand-up, you talk a lot about your experiences as a British Asian. Do you use stand-up as a - platform to discuss race?</li>
<li>Following that thread, do you think there is a line between humour and political correctness?</li>
<li>Do you think being British Asian also influenced the humour you have now?</li>
<li>And have you got any plans for exploring Auckland?</li>

<li><strong>In Conversation With: James Shaw</strong>
SO WHILE YOU WERE LIVING OVER IN LONDON, HOW DID YOU FIND LOCAL POLITICS IN LONDON COMPARED TO LOCAL - POLITICS HERE?
DURING THE ELECTION, HOW DOES THE GREEN PARTY PLAN TO EXPAND ITS VOTER BASE WITH-OUT JUST POACHING VOTERS - FROM LABOUR?
HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THE PERCEPTION THAT HAVING A COALITION GOVERNMENT ISN’T AS STRONG AS A SINGLE-PARTY - GOVERNMENT?</li>
<li>DID YOU CONSIDER NOT STANDING CANDIDATES IN ANY OTHER ELECTORATES?
DO YOU THINK THERE WOULD BE ANY CIRCUM-STANCES WHERE YOU COULD WORK WITH NA-TIONAL SO THAT THERE IS AT LEAST - SOME INPUT FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL PARTY?
WHERE DO YOU SEE THE FUTURE OF THE GREEN PARTY? YOU’VE MOVED AWAY FROM YOUR ACTIVIST ROOTS AS YOU’VE BECOME - MORE MAIN-STREAM—HOW DO YOU SEE THAT DEVELOPING?</li>
