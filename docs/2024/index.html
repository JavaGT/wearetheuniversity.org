<ul>
<li>Infomation leaks from staff to students that rapid course cuts are being asked of the schools, who are to identfy courses to be cut and that those with under 60 enrolments are eligible for the chop.</li>
<li>WATU organized a student-led forum in the quad addressing these cuts, demanding more information and transparency from the university administration. Threatening to pamplet prospective students at the upcoming open day if the administration does not attend to discuss the cuts with students. Other actions included consulting students and staff for feedback and challenging the administration’s justifications, which varied between financial issues, timetabling constraints, and staff workload concerns.</li>
<li>The Provost attended the forum but was criticized for being evasive and providing inconsistent information about the cuts.</li>
<li>The TEU also raised concerns about significant course cuts, particularly small courses, under the University’s Curriculum Transformation Project.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Senate Meeting and Academic Staff Pushback</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Academic staff wrote an open letter calling for a special Senate meeting after the administration failed to consult Senate on curriculum changes.</li>

</li>
