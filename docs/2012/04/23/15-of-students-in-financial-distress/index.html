After a few hours your feet and hands get numb," said University of Auckland student Alisha, 22. "I'm looking forward to being back on campus where it's warm."</p><p></p><p>Findings of the Baseline Report of the Graduate Longitudinal Study New Zealand (GLSNZ) show that around 15% of students suffer from absolute financial distress and aren't able to afford basic accommodation, food and clothing requirements.</p><p></p><p>The results of the GLSNZ were released this month. It sampled nearly 9,000 students in their final year across the eight New Zealand universities between July and December 2011. It will follow these graduates over the next ten years.</p><p>“We know there are students in severe financial hardship. The numbers of food parcels and emergency hardship grants we’ve been giving out have only increased in the last two years,” said Arena Williams, President of the Auckland University Students’ Association.</p><p></p><p>“However, when almost 1 in 6 students are in severe financial distress, we have to start asking questions about whether the Government is fulfilling its role to ensure that everyone with the potential to succeed in tertiary education has a fair chance,” said Ms Williams.</p><p>The Auckland University Students’ Association calls for improvements to the student living allowance scheme. The maximum entitlement per week for a student under 24, without children, living away from home is $170.80. This should be adjusted to reflect the true cost of living in University centres.</p><p></p><p>“New Zealander’s can’t stand for a tertiary education system that allows only those with parental support to succeed and complete their qualifications. If you haven’t grown up in a home where a University education is ordinary, you’re very unlikely to work for years to support yourself and then come back to study,” said Ms Williams.</p><p>The Auckland University Students’ Association will be demonstrating student financial distress in the University Quad today. Students will be asked to undertake extreme challenges such as mass lube wrestling, eating pigs eyes and lambs brains, setting themselves on fire and public nudity. Any students desperate enough to attempt the challenges will receive much needed cash.</p><p><br>Students at the University of Auckland will be gathering in the Quad for the extreme challenges at 12pm, starting at 12.15.</p><p>ENDS<br></p><p></p></section></body>
