<p>By free, we mean free of conditions.  We recognise that education at other institutions is only open to those who are willing to live with debt, and our aim is to not be a burden on those studying with us.</p>
<p>We are a self-organising collective, without ties to Government or corporations.  We exist not to produce ‘degrees for jobs’, but to enable a human being to improve themselves and the society in which they exist.</p>
<p>Courses are open to all, and anyone can run a course.</p>
<p>We hold lectures, seminars, exhibitions and workshops at a variety of locations, including<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130208031151/http://tangleball.org.nz/">Tangle Ball</a>, a community workshop and art space near Karangahape Road, and at various public venues through the city, such as Myers Park, Albert Park and others.”</p>
