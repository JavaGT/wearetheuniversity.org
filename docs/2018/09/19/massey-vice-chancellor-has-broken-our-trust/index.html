     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations
</code></pre>
<p>(NZUSA) is outraged by recent revelations that a
Vice-Chancellor threatened to cut funding to a students’
association due to actions they disagreed with.</p><p> </p><p>In
emails released under the Official Information Act, Massey
University Vice-Chancellor Jan Thomas considered cutting
funding to the students’ association and clubs if they
decided to proceed with an event involving Don Brash
speaking on campus.</p><p> </p><p>‘We should be able to have
robust debate on campus with people we disagree with,
including our university leaders. But to consider cutting
funding to a group that disagrees with your actions is just
foul play,’ says National President Jonathan Gee.</p><p></p>
</p><p>‘While we do not agree with Don Brash’s views on race
and many other issues, we support the right to free speech.
As the critic and conscience of society, universities should
be the bastions of that, not undermine it,’ says Massey
University Students’ Association (MUSA) President Ngahuia
Kirton.</p><p> </p><p>Gee says that these tactics have stemmed from
Voluntary Student Membership, where tertiary institutions’
management now hold all the cards.</p><p> </p><p>‘Students’
associations have for too long been silenced from
criticising our institutions for fear of ‘biting the hand
that feeds us’. These emails from the Vice-Chancellor are
the purest example of the silencing effect that Voluntary
Student Membership has had on student voice.’</p><p>
</p><p>Voluntary Student Membership (VSM) was passed by
Parliament through the Education (Freedom of Association)
Amendment Bill in 2011, despite strong opposition. Since
VSM, students’ associations have had to negotiate their
core funding with their tertiary institutions, as opposed to
receiving levies from students directly. The revenues of
students’ associations have since reduced dramatically,
some by over half since 2011.

<p> </p><p>‘Two wrongs do not
make a right. Threatening cuts to funding key student
services in order to get what you want is not fair game.
Everybody loses,’ says Jason Woodroofe, Albany Students’
Association President.</p><p> </p><p>The Vice-Chancellor has also
broken the trust of staff and students through assuring them
that her main consideration in preventing Don Brash from
speaking was security, when this has clearly not been the
case. She has misled the Chair of Academic Board, who are in
part the guardians of the university’s role of being
society’s critic and conscience.</p><p> </p><p>‘We join
Massey’s students’ associations in their call for their
University Council to clarify its stance on funding
independent students’ associations. The Vice-Chancellor
has broken the trust we have with our institutions, and we
want to rebuild that.’</p><p>
