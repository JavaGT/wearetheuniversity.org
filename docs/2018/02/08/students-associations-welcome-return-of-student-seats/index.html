<p>return of student seats on TEI Councils</p><p> </p><p>Students’
associations around the country have welcomed today’s
introduction of a new Education Amendment Bill which will
restore staff and student seats on Tertiary Education
Institution (TEI) Councils. The Bill, once passed into law,
will primarily affect polytechnic councils, many of which
removed student seats when the previous Government scrapped
the representation requirement.</p><p> </p><p>‘This is a huge step
forward in student representation,’ says Melissa Evans,
National Vice President of the New Zealand Union of
Students’ Associations (NZUSA). ‘Students are the
primary stakeholders of tertiary education, so it only makes
sense that they have seat at the highest level of
decision-making.’</p><p> </p><p>‘It is wonderful to see that the
Government takes the issue of student representation
seriously in the tertiary sector. It has been a long-term
issue for Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics (ITPs)
and it is good they are acting on this quickly,’ says
Dallas Adams (President, Younited Students’ Association
– Eastern Institute of Technology).</p><p> </p><p>‘Tino pai
tenei korero mo nga rangatahi te kaha kite korero mo nga
rangatahi katoa ki roto Aotearoa ki runga, nga poori o nga
kura katoa. This is wonderful news that our students will
have a voice at the top of institutions to be there to
represent their peers’, says Emire Khan-Malak (President,
Student Pulse Te Runanga Tauira – Toi Ohomai Institute of
Technology).</p>

<p> </p><p>‘Having students involved in the ITP
decision making process is not only exciting, but important
as it will help to further strengthen the student voice,’
says Izzy Paterson (President, Association of Students at
UCOL).</p><p> </p><p>Evans says that this is just the first step to
effective and true student representation.</p><p> </p><p>‘Student
voice does not exist in a vacuum. In order for genuine
student voice to take place on councils, institutions must
be willing to support student representatives through
training, resourcing, connecting them with the independent
students’ association and instilling a culture of hearing
and heeding the student voice across the institution.’</p><p>
</p><p>NZUSA looks forward to engaging with Members of
Parliament to ensure that the legislation is as robust as
possible to facilitate effective student voice.</p><p>
