     16 October 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Student presidents call on MPs to
</code></pre>
<p>strengthen Education Amendment Bill</p><p> </p><p>Student presidents
from all eight universities and numerous polytechnics have
signed an open letter calling on Members of Parliament to
strengthen student representation on tertiary education
councils. MPs have been urged to support a Supplementary
Order Paper in the name of Chlöe Swarbrick that would
guarantee at least two student places on Councils, rather
than the one provided in the Government’s Education
Amendment Bill.</p><p> </p><p>‘We strongly support the Greens’
proposed change to this Government Bill. Guaranteeing at
least two student places ensures genuine representation, not
check-box tokenism,’ says Jonathan Gee, President of the
NZ Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).</p><p> </p><p>The
signatories, some of which are also members of their
institutions’ councils, say that genuine representation
would help advance the Government’s commitment to
transform the education system and put learners at the
centre.</p><p> </p><p>‘Two seats means student representatives can
share and discuss confidential information to come to robust
conclusions, and support each other on putting forward that
perspective. This is in line with the Government’s
cross-partisan ambition to transform the education system
for the better, putting learners and their needs at the
centre,’ says James Ranstead, President of the Lincoln
University Students’ Association (LUSA).</p><p> </p><p>‘Only one
out of 16 polytechnics has a student representative on their
Council currently. If we are to hit the ground running as
student representatives on Council when the Bill passes,
then we need two representatives so we can support each
other,’ says Karla Davis, President of the Association of
Students at UCOL (AS@U).</p><p> </p><p>The Bill is set to go to the
Committee of the Whole House stage in Parliament this week.
The open letter can be found here.  </p><p> </p><p>ENDS</p><p></p>
