</p><p>The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA)
has welcomed the Government’s announcement today that they
will extend the student loan borrowing cap for long
undergraduate courses.</p><p> </p><p>‘This doesn’t just benefit
students, but also benefits the health and wellbeing of New
Zealand. Allowing our future doctors, vets and dentists to
finish their studies is a no-brainer,’ says National
President Jonathan Gee.</p><p> </p><p>Caitlin Barlow-Groome,
President of the Otago University Students’ Association
(OUSA), says that this announcement is great news for her
students.</p><p> </p><p>‘Otago University has one of the two
medical schools in the country, along with dentistry. This
announcement is great for these students, especially if
they’ve hit the student loan cap due to completing another
degree before getting into these competitive
programmes.’</p><p> </p><p>Gee says that the decision is likely to
result in greater equity for students wanting to enter
certain health professions.</p><p> </p><p>‘We have heard stories
of students from disadvantaged backgrounds take a little
longer to realise their dreams of entering programmes like
medicine. They shouldn’t be denied their dreams simply due
to an arbitrary cap.’</p><p> </p><p>‘Students have been calling
for this extension for some time. We’re glad the
Government has heard that call and kept its election
promise.’</p><p> </p><p>Gee says, however, there is still more to
be done to remove unfair barriers to education.</p><p>
</p><p>‘This Government has made a commitment to a
barrier-free education. We hope that the Government
continues to keep its word and remove other barriers such as
restoring the postgraduate allowance, which was also an
election promise.’</p><p> </p><p>“Our students are anxiously
waiting.’</p><p>
