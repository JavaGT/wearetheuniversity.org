</code></pre>
<p>voice’ – NZUSA</strong><br><strong>
</strong><br>Students have told MPs that they have an
opportunity to turn the tide on previous laws which have
stifled the student voice in tertiary education.  This comes
as Parliament debates the Education Amendment Bill, which
proposes the restoration of one staff and one student seat
on tertiary education institution (TEI) councils.</p><p>The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations
(NZUSA) made an oral submission to the Education and
Workforce select committee last week. In response to a
question from Labour MP Jamie Strange about the trend of
student voice over the years, National President Jonathan
Gee said, ‘successive parliaments have stifled student
voice.’</p><p>‘Voluntary student membership in 2011
attacked the formalised structures we had to support student
voice, particularly in our polytechnics. It’s unsurprising
therefore that when the previous Government removed the
requirement of student seats on councils, only one
polytechnic retained a student place on their council.
However, this Bill will change that.’</p><p>Gee said
that the Bill was an important first step, but must go
further to ensure students make a meaningful contribution to
tertiary education governance.</p><p>‘We strongly
welcome this Bill as an important step to restoring student
voice in tertiary governance, but this is not the end of the
conversation’, says Jonathan Gee.</p><p>NZUSA and its
members are calling for at least two staff and two student
places on TEI councils.</p>

<p>Isabella Lenihan-Ikin, a
student member on the Victoria University of Wellington
Council, who joined NZUSA’s oral submission, said that
‘with Victoria having two student places on its council,
it’s great to have someone who brings a similar lived
experience to me. One student is not able to represent the
views of all students, so having two students doubles the
number of student voices coming through.’</p><p>‘Two
student places will make councils more diverse and
reflective of the student community’, says Gee.</p><p>NZUSA says that the select committee has the chance to
give community wisdom a stronger place on TEI councils
through:<br>•	Reserving a student seat for the students’
association president<br>•	Requiring at least two staff
and two student places on TEI councils<br>•	Increasing the
size of councils</p><p>‘As public institutions, our
communities (and taxpayers) expect public benefit from our
institutions, not just private return. It’s therefore
essential that community wisdom has a stronger place on TEI
councils through increasing the number of staff and student
seats.’</p><p>ENDS</p><p>
