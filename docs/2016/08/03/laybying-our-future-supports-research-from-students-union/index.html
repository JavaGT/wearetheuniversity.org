<p>supports research from National Students
Union</strong></p><p>The New Zealand Union of Students’
Associations congratulates the hard work of Max Lin in the
completion of his report ‘Laybying our Future’ in
conjunction with the Child Poverty Action Group. NZUSA is
pleased to hear of other groups focussing on the issue of
student hardship and the impact that is having on students
and their prospects. </p><p>The findings of Max Lin’s report
strongly reflect research undertaken by NZUSA in 2014 and
published in its Tertiary Income and Expenditure Survey. </p>
</p><p>Laybying our Future highlights the significant pressures
on students (both financial and mental) and is consistent
with NZUSA’s findings that almost half (44%) of students
don’t have enough income to meet their basic needs.
</p><p>NZUSA President Linsey Higgins is deeply concerned about
the impact that the lack of financial support is having on
students in the tertiary sector. </p><p>“To be able to access
a fulfilling life, many people require a tertiary education,
be it to be a builder or a biologist. It’s not just about
University anymore.” </p><p>“Yet we know that student
support fails to measure up to the cost of living and
students are working more hours than ever before just to
make ends meet. On top of this we are concerned about the
creep of internships and unpaid placements into the study
workload, with no University in New Zealand having a central
hub that knows just how many hours they are requiring
students to undertake free labour.” 
</p><div class="article-left-box-wrapper"><div class="article-left-box">
        




<div class="headline-right"></div>

</div></div>
<p>“The current
tertiary system is geared against failure, with failed
papers often restricting access to study or student support.
So students are forced to work (paid and unpaid) and achieve
at a satisfactory academic level. Needless to say this is
having a massive impact on student wellbeing.”
</p><p>“Counselling services at tertiary institutions are
over-run and many have now implemented restrictions or
reduced access due to the overwhelming demand of students
presenting with depression, stress and anxiety.”
</p><p>“With only 26% of students having support from family
for living expenses those who don’t are forced to watch
the quality of their education suffer or starve.” </p><p>“If
we want our graduates to be the best possible we should give
them the time and space to devote their full attention to
achieving at the highest level possible for them, not force
them to divide their time and attention.” </p><p>“Beating
our students into submission through overwork isn’t going
to deliver the returns that we want as a country.”
</p><p>NZUSA believes that there needs to be a serious review of
the student loan system as currently government claims
around the impact of the student loan system means decisions
are being made based off Australian research, which is from
a system very different to ours, or are hopelessly
out-dated.” </p><p>However, while agreeing with the
overwhelming majority of the recommendations from the
report, NZUSA rejects that there is any need to evaluate any
perceived benefits from charging interest on the student
loans of New Zealand-based graduates. </p><p>"When there was
interest on student loans, it was inherently bad for women
or for others who took time out of the workforce to look
after children or other family members, and for lower paid
graduates. Their loans grew as they struggled with other
costs or while they were engaged in unpaid caring
activities. When interest was charged women spent twice as
long paying off their loans, now the difference is just
months", explained Higgins. </p><p>ENDS </p><p>Tertiary Income and
Expenditure Survey can be found at: <a href="http://www.students.org.nz/income_and_expenditure_survey?e=4236cfde8d142a4e913140d100895c4855638393&amp;utm_source=students&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=laybying_1&amp;n=1" target="_blank">www.students.org.nz/income_and_expenditure_survey</a>
</p><p>NZUSA Income and Expenditure Survey 2014 Recommendations
</p><p>1. Restore postgraduate allowances.  </p><p>The cut hasn’t
saved money, but it has hurt the students who should be
supported to research and innovate. The number of postgrad
students taking on debt to pay for basics like rent has shot
up by 32.62% since the change.  </p><p>2. Introduce a universal
housing grant in cities where weekly rent is gobbling up
more than 70% of student income.  </p><p>3. Begin adequately
funding universities and polytechnics so that they stop
passing cost rises onto students.  </p><p>4. Scrap the unfair
12c repayment rate that kicks in at $19,084.  </p><p>Replace it
with an Australian-style progressive repayment system so
those who can pay, do, and those who can’t can have enough
take-home pay to survive. </p><p>5. Introduce a $10,000 national
First in Family Scholarship.  </p><p>To break the cycle of the
poverty of opportunity and encourage students from families
with no history of degree level study to participate in
degree-level tertiary education. It’s the cheapest way of
ensuring rising levels of participation in the
transformative experience of tertiary education. Good for
students, even better for underrepresented communities. 
</p><p>6. Lift the course related costs loan cap (frozen since
1)    to $10,000 for first-year students and $3,000 for
other students.  </p><p>Students are getting into bank and
credit card debt just to pay for basics like upfront hall
costs and art supplies. It’s about access.  </p><p>7. Restore
full access for over-40s to student allowances, and access
to allowances and loans for over-65s.  </p><p>This is age
discrimination and may be illegal under the UN Human Rights
Convention.  </p><p>8. Restore the national significance
exceptions to the 200-week limit on student allowances. 
</p><p>We recommend doing this by restoring a category of
qualifications of national significance where students could
have access to further years of allowances based on the
qualification sought. Cutting this has hit medical students
hardest, who take longer than six years to complete their
degree. They shouldn’t have the rug pulled from under them
when still completing their first degree.  </p><p>9. Begin to
lift the parental income threshold again (frozen since 2008)
so that more students, not less, can receive student
allowances.  </p><p>Since 2012 there has been a 24.61 per cent
reduction in the number of students eligible for allowances.
</p><p>10. Launch a full inquiry into the impact of student debt
</p><p>Student support change timeline  </p><p>2010 
</p><p>•	Recipients of superannuation and veteran’s pension
eligibility for allowances removed.  </p><p>•	Student loan
establishment fee increased.  </p><p>•	Annual IRD admin fee
introduced. A cost for having a loan that undermines the
interest-free scheme. </p><p>•	Two-year stand-down introduced
for Australians and permanent residents.  </p><p>•	Loan
eligibility removed for those who didn’t pass ½ their
papers the previous year.  </p><p>•	7-EFTS life-time limit
introduced to borrowing entitlement.  </p><p>2011

course-related costs removed.  </p><p>2012 </p><p>•	Post-graduate
students’ entitlement to allowances removed.  </p><p>•	All
exceptions (such as national significance or recognised long
course) to 200-week limit on allowances removed. 
</p><p>•	Parental income limit frozen. No longer adjusts with
inflation, making fewer students eligible.
</p><p>•	Restrictions on borrowing – below the course fees
charged – for pilots. Students need to find money from
some other source.  </p><p>•	Repayment rate increases from 10%
to 12% and repayment threshold frozen.  </p><p>•	New matching
agreement introduced between Customs and Inland Revenue to
restrict the movement from New Zealand of some student loan
borrowers.  </p><p>2013 </p><p>•	Stand-down increased to

longer adjusts with inflation, making fewer students
eligible.  </p><p>•	Students aged over 65 all eligibility to
allowances removed.  </p><p>•	Students aged under-18 doing fee
free level one or two courses will not qualify for any
component of the student loan.  </p><p>•	Student loan
