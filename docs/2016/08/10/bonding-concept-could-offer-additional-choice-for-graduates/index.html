    Bonding Concept Could Offer Additional Choice for
    Graduates</p>
<p></p>
<p>The New Zealand Union of Students’
    Associations has welcomed Labour Party leader Andrew
    Little's floating of the idea of bonding graduates to public
    sector jobs in exchange for support with reducing their
    student loans. </p>
<p>“As with any idea, we think it is
    important to get the perspectives from a number of parties
    including those affected before making a commitment to any
    policy” says NZUSA President Linsey Higgins </p>
<p>“However,
    we support any ideas that address the skyrocketing levels of
    student debt. While we know that some graduates may not want
    to bond themselves, others will relish the opportunity for
    secure employment and decreased loan repayment times.”
</p>
<p>“We know that a number of public service jobs are
    generally lower paid than the private sector and these jobs
    have contended with flat wages for some time. Many of these
    low paid public service jobs are dominated by women and any
    efforts to decrease repayment times would be a significant
    measure in creating greater levels of equality.” </p>
<p>“The
    system of bonding worked very well in the past with groups
    such as teachers, nurses and doctors and continues to work
    well for doctors who commit to working in rural areas. Some
    of these public sector roles are crucial to ensuring the
    wellbeing and success of our society such as teachers,
    teacher aids, nurses, care givers, social workers, doctors.
    We would encourage efforts to support people in these
    occupations in the private sector as well.”

<p>“Bonding
    in exchange for student loan repayment assistance is an
    issue that we will be asking students about when we visit
    campuses over the latter half of this year.” </p>
<p>“We
    would also like to acknowledge other parties who have
    already made commitments to similar schemes, including New
    Zealand First.” </p>
<p>“Finally we look forward to the
    opportunity to explore this issue further with the Labour
    Party, and other parties, in order to identify the groups,
    and occupations, who may benefit significantly by this idea
    and could be addressed as a matter of priority. We naturally
    would also seek to incorporate the voices of students.”
