</code></pre>
<p>Recommended</p><p></p><p>The New Zealand Union of Students’
Associations supports the decision of the Waikato Regional
Council to implement a 30% discount for Waikato University
students on their BUSIT fares. </p><p>NZUSA&#39;s research shows
that transport is a significant barrier for students
accessing their tertiary education and employment. </p><p>NZUSA
is aware that this subsidy was due to a significant level of
lobbying of the Waikato Students’ Union (WSU) after the
introduction of paid parking at the University last year.</p>
</p><p>“This is definitely going to support students at
Waikato University. However, we would expect to see this
subsidy extended to support for all students in the Waikato
region including those at Wintec and Te Wānanaga o
Aotearoa.”  </p><p>Student Association at Wintec (SAWIT)
President Logan Robinson says “parking is one of the
biggest issues Wintec students encounter on both the City
and Rotokauri campus. This is an opportunity to show
potential and current students and residents of Hamilton
that the governance, amenities and institutes are willing to
work together to support students to learn, develop and
reside within the city. SAWIT would love to see this rolled
out to include Wintec students because we think it would be
hugely beneficial to resolving the issues around parking as
well as the financial strain many students find themselves
under.” </p><p> “We believe that all students should have
equal opportunities to access education and would strongly
encourage Regional Council staff and Wintec senior
leadership to engage and find a solution for our
students.”

<p>Higgins acknowledged that the announcement
is an important first step NZUSA, and encourages this (and
all) regional councils to implement a strategy that allows
for the implementation of free transport for all tertiary
students in their region. </p><p>“Free public transport breaks
down one of the barriers that stops students getting to
their classes. If we can break down these barriers we will
give students a greater opportunity to succeed at a higher
level and be better prepared graduates.” </p><p>ENDS
