We believe the University should function as the ‘critic and conscience of society’ and as an open space for expression of dissent. The escalating profit-driven and market-oriented agenda of the University over the last <del>thirty</del> fourty years has eroded these principles.</p>
<h1>Key values</h1>
<ul>
<li>&quot;The university&quot; refers to the collective of staff and students who make up the institution. The identity of the university is not defined by management.</li>
<li>University has three core functions: teaching, research, and service to the community. These functions should be the primary focus of the university.</li>
<li>University is a public good. Accordingly, the university should be free to access.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are committed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reclaiming the University, we believe in Free, accessible, and quality education. </li>
<li>Political freedom, and democratic governance of the university.</li>
<li>No privatisation of education.</li>
<li>Education and research should be driven by the needs of people, not the interests of the market.</li>
<li>Management is not the University. </li>
<li>Students, academics and workers all make this place what it is, and the truth is <strong>we are not a product of the university, WE ARE THE UNIVERSITY!</strong></li>
</ul>
