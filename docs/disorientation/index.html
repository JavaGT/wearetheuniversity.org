<p><strong>Disorientation?</strong><br>Where this University appears as a neutral educational space, Disorientation tears at its apolitical facade. The conditions of this university are neither natural nor inevitable but the result of deliberate political decisions driven by the unrelenting greed of capital. As the university champions neoliberal futures, we are reminded that capitalism comes into being &quot;dripping from head to toe, from every pore, with blood and dirt.&quot;</p>
<p>In a world that demands utility from every endeavor, it’s important to assert that education can still be an end in itself. We want to remember that this place is more than an institution. And, in the midst of overwhelming suffering, it’s nice to get involved in things with other people. The University of Auckland (UoA) can be incredibly isolating, and it’s not at all obvious what’s going on when you first arrive. We wanted to put something out there that would serve as an invitation for you to join us or one of the other groups around campus.</p>

<p><strong>Welcome to the Ruins of the Social Democratic University</strong><br>While our aging left-wing academics yearn for a return to the &#39;golden era,&#39; the reactionary right continues its brutal assault on the working class, unabated by the swings of parliamentary democracy. Forty years deep into this neoliberal nightmare, we cannot expect the university to imagine a future beyond the infinite subsumption of labor under capital.</p>
<p>As the University celebrates its sad, desperate climb up the global rankings, we find ourselves in a dire situation. We work bullshit jobs just to afford the work of studying. We traverse ever-developed spaces on curated educational journeys, barraged by vocational demands and consumerist appeals. Rent goes up. Transport goes up. Food goes up. Our fees always go up. They call it a cost-of-living crisis, but it’s not a crisis—it’s the system working as intended, because the line must go up.</p>
<p>As the University dismantles the few remaining spaces of sociality, stress overflows in a hellscape of consumerist futurity. The University responds with well-being weeks and state-of-the-art suicide prevention technologies. This is neoliberalism unfolding as planned, and the university is its beating heart.</p>
<p>Hand in hand with central government, University management has transformed UoA into a corporate machine designed to produce governed citizen-workers, commodify knowledge, absolve the state of responsibility for social welfare, and ensure the accumulation of private property and wealth. In their world, we aren’t learners—we’re buyers investing in ourselves to become more attractive commodities in the labor market, transmuted into self-regulating, atomized market entities. Their Manichean world, built on a racialized class divide, is split along material and ideological lines, upholding the hegemonic power of the bourgeois settler-colonial state.</p>
<p>However, the totalizing appearance of capital is not reality. Among the ruins and between ourselves, there is always an opportunity for something else. Beneath the institution, in the decaying corpse of the commons, there are roots we might dig out, raise up, and cast into the light as something new. What is politics if not the making of new worlds possible?</p>

<p><strong>Student Politics</strong><br>While the university promotes its collaboration with AUSA (Auckland University Students&#39; Association) and the &quot;raising of student voices,&quot; its antagonistic relationship to student politics is obscured. Stripped of material independence by central government and university management, and having abandoned any semblance of solidarity with its former allies, AUSA is now indistinguishable from the university itself.</p>
<p>But the end of AUSA as a political entity does not mean the end of student politics. While on-campus protests contest the future of tertiary education, student politics always extends beyond the boundaries of the university. Through our involvement in wider struggles, we find our strength, making different presents and futures possible.</p>

<p><strong>History</strong><br>As the towers of liberal progress climb ever higher, claiming great swathes of our sky, we turn to the earth and dig at their foundations.</p>
<p>The University of Auckland is built on the whenua (land) of Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, on the site of the Albert Barracks military installation. This land was wrested from Māori control and settled with soldiers to achieve what Marx calls &quot;primitive accumulation&quot;—the transformation of the collective property of iwi Māori into the private property of the colonial capitalist class.</p>
<p>As Māori resistance to colonization was defeated, the University shared in the glut of war spoils, financed by the sale of land stolen by the Crown from Waikato-Tainui, Ngāti Awa, and Ngāpuhi.</p>
<p>Just as Albert Barracks protected paranoid settlers from resistance to colonization, the University now protects paranoid capitalists from ideological resistance. It supports the economic development of the colonial capitalist state, ensures new generations of workers are deradicalized by heavy debt burdens, and disciplines the proletariat by dividing us into &quot;qualified&quot; and &quot;unqualified&quot; workers.</p>
