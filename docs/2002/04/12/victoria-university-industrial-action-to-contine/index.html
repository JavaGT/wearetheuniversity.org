<p><br>VICTORIA UNIVERSITY INDUSTRIAL ACTION TO
CONTINUE: STAFF REELING AFTER REFUSAL FROM VICE
CHANCELLOR</p>

<p>The determination of members of the Association
of University Staff [AUS] and Public Service Association
[PSA] at Victoria University, to protect their right to fair
contract negotiations has strengthened after a pre-Easter
strike.  "Members have shown the strength of their resolve
at meetings yesterday and today.  We will be building up to
an indefinite withdrawal of examination results in June. 
The negotiations now hinge around a matter of principle
which staff will not compromise on" said Tony Quinn, General
Staff Vice-President.<p>

<p>University staff went on strike on
Wednesday 27th and Thursday 28th March after the Vice
Chancellor's refusal of a counter-offer where staff accepted
the university's offer of 3.2% if a late claim to alter the
term of the agreement and a proposed Memorandum of
Understanding was withdrawn.  Staff demand that these
conditions be met.  The university waited to put forward the
late claim until after staff had called off a strike
scheduled for the 4th March.  Staff were appalled, and
question whether this is in line with the principles of good
faith bargaining. The claim to alter the term of the
agreement threatens to compromise staff bargaining power
because it will mean the university budget will be set
before negotiations are underway, and it will position the
crucial time for negotiations during the December/January
period when most staff at the university are required to
take their annual leave.<p>
<p>"This timing will completely
undermine the process of negotiations.  Not only will the
university budget have been decided, but our ability to
communicate with members will be undermined.  During this
period we cannot progress negotiations effectively because
we, unlike the Vice Chancellor, are representatives and must
get feedback from our members at every stage of
negotiations" said Christine McCarthy, Academic President
"The claim to alter the term is a recipe for prolonged
negotiations - it is not a claim that would come from an
institution interested in productive discussions, nor an
institution which cherishes effective staff
communication."</p>

<p>The proposed Memorandum of Understanding
staff found equally unacceptable.  "The Memorandum of
Understanding means this is not a true 3.2% increase for
staff salaries.  The Memorandum makes 1.2% of the 3.2%
increase conditional on government funding" said Tony Quinn,
General Staff President.  According to Stuart McCutcheon,
the Vice-Chancellor at Victoria University, removing the
Memorandum of Understanding "would expose the University's
financial position to an unacceptable level of risk". 
Unconditional salary offers at Waikato of 3.2% and Massey of
3.5% demonstrate that the Victoria offer is not overly
generous.  Waikato University reported an operating surplus
of $4.9 million while Victoria reported a $5.1 million
profit.</p>

<p>"The Vice-Chancellor’s statement regarding the
Memorandum of Understanding simply points to a lack of long
term commitment to staff salaries.  Victoria University
increased its income from students by 10% in the last year. 
This increase is largely due to increasing student numbers
which means increasing teaching loads, more assignments to
mark, more library books to issue, and more enrolment forms
to process.  This is work done by underpaid staff - not by
managers such as the Vice-Chancellor.  We are bearing the
brunt of increasing students in our increasing workloads and
the university is not willing to recognise this in our
renumeration, nor it is prepared to negotiate with us
fairly"  said Christine McCarthy.<p>

<p>In contrast to the 10%
increase Victoria University gained from the increase in
student numbers, the spending on staff over the year was a
mere 1.4%.  Similar figures at Otago University show an
increase in student revenue of 2.8% and an increase in
expenditure of staff of 1.5%.  The latest figures for
student enrolment this year show another increase in
enrolments.  "The management may be over the moon with
another year of significant increases in student numbers but
staff know that this increase will mean they will be even
more stretched and the education students receive will be
compromised further" Tony Quinn
concluded.</p>
