<p><br>University staff reserve judgement
on new ministerial powers</p>

<p>The Association of University
Staff [AUS] wants more information before passing judgement
on the Government's introduction of ministerial powers to
set student fees maxima for university courses.
'Universities need better public funding and our response to
the idea of the Minister determining how much universities
can charge students depends on the size of the government's
contribution,' said Dr Grant Duncan, AUS National
President.</p>

<p>'We await details of the fee-maxima scheme,'
said Dr Duncan. 'Commenting on this proposal is like buying
a ticket to a roller-coaster, you don't know whether you'll
feel thrilled or sickened by the outcome. Fees maxima could
rise or fall dramatically, so our evaluation would have to
be on a year by year basis'.</p>

<p>'As a matter of democratic
process, though, it is very disappointing that Government
has sneaked this provision through in a last-minute addition
to the Tertiary Education Reform Bill, preventing formal
submissions from University Councils and others. To remove
very significant powers, such as the mandate to set tuition
fees, from institutions without consulting sector groups or
calling for public submissions does little to inspire trust
in Government.</p>

<p>'The imposition of fees maxima, however, is
a further sign that the competitive, privatised model of the
1990s is on its way out. But it is also a sign that this
Government and the last one both failed to provide
sufficient public investment in the sector. If public
funding had been adequate, student fees would not be as high
as they are.<p>
<p>'At least Governments can be held to account
by students and their families through the elections, and
explicit fee-maxima set by Government avoid the bribery they
employed to enforce fees stabilisation through the last
three Budgets. But we have yet to be convinced that
Government will manage fee-setting more fairly or
effectively than University Councils did.</p>

<p>'Also, this
concept indicates that Government is getting more deeply
into centralised control of universities. We now have
ministerial control over sectoral strategy, institutional
priorities and charters, tuition subsidies, research
objectives and funding, and student fees. As the Minister
will have his hands firmly on nearly every lever, he is only
one step away from steering industrial relations in the
sector, something that to-date he's been in denial about.
Nearly every move he makes from now will have an effect on
our members' salaries.'</p>

<p>AUS also see the fee maxima idea
as a further sign that student fees are now thoroughly
entrenched. But government needs also to deal with the more
costly question of student living allowances.<p>

<p>'Our future
support for fees maxima will depend on whether they are fair
and affordable for students, and whether the public
investment in universities will be adequate to sustain both
the affordability and the quality of education,' Dr Duncan
added. AUS reactions to the future fees maxima will
therefore be directly linked to a number of factors which
are still unknown and which could easily change from year to
year. These factors include:</p>

<p>* The size of the fees maxima
in aggregate terms and in relation to past fees<br>* The
different levels of fees allowed between different kinds of
courses and    between different institutions<br>* The level
of public investment in university teaching and research
subsidies <br>* The future of tertiary student
allowances</p>
