December 2007</p>

<p>University entry restrictions a matter for
concern, says union</p>

<p>A proposal to restrict further
undergraduate student entry to the University of Auckland
from 2009 has been described as unnecessarily hurried and
worrying by the union representing university staff.
Association of University Staff (AUS) National President,
Professor Nigel Haworth, said that it is essential that the
University takes great care over and examines the long-term
effects of a restricted entry policy as, once in place, such
restrictions would not be reversed.<p>

<p>The University of
Auckland Senate, an academic board comprising senior
University management and academics, yesterday accepted a
recommendation that that first-year entry to the University
in Arts, Science, Education and Law may be restricted from
the end of next year. The recommendation will now go to the
University Council for a final decision on 10
December.</p>

<p>Professor Haworth says that, while the rationale
for the move has arisen as a result of new funding
arrangements which, although not yet confirmed, indicate
that the University will not be funded for increased student
numbers from 2008, it also reflects the use by the
University of the tertiary reform process to differentiate
the University of Auckland from other universities in the
New Zealand system, a strategic goal in place for some
years.<p>

<p>Professor Haworth said that, while the AUS broadly
supports the tertiary reforms, in the absence of a clear
plan for tertiary education provision in the Auckland
region, the arbitrary capping of student intake in the
region’s largest tertiary institution must be a matter of
concern for the regional community and Government,
particularly if other institutions follow suit. “The
University of Auckland needs to consider the long-term
tertiary education needs of Auckland and New Zealand as a
whole when taking decisions of this nature,” he said.
“Any change in policy must involve wide community
consultation before decisions are made if the strong
relationship between the University and its community are to
remain strong.”<p>
<p>Professor Haworth said that much more
information was needed before an informed decision could be
made, including an examination of how the University would
continue to meet its social obligations, including that
prospective students from a broad variety of backgrounds
were able to get access to the University. “It would be
unacceptable if a consequence of this move was that the
Auckland became a ‘university of the advantaged’ in
which disadvantaged communities – especially Maori and
Pasifika – were compartmentalised into affirmative action
programmes”, he
said.</p>
