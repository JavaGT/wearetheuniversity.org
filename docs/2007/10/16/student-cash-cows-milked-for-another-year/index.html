<p>Media Release - 16

<p>Student ‘cash
cows’ - milked for another year!</p>

<p>International students
continue to be milked for yet another year. The University
of Auckland has hiked fees for most of its international
students for 2008, and turned its back on possible
alternatives to continuing fee rises.</p>

<p>“This is
incredibly disappointing. International students deserve to
be treated better than this. They shouldn’t be treated as
cash cows by institutions. Raising fees when international
student numbers continue to fall is perverse,” says
Bethanie Maples, AUSA Acting President.</p>

<p>Fees for almost
all programmes will rise by a minimum of 5%. Students in
selected programmes get a special surprise – a 7.5% hike
in Architecture, Business and Economics, Engineering, Health
Sciences, and Law.<p>

<p>In most cases these fee rises amount
to upwards of $1000 a year. For example, undergraduate
international students in Engineering face an estimated
increase of almost $2000 a year, to be paying around a
whopping $27,000 per year.</p>

<p>“These fee rises are simply
appalling. For students already here, it means that they may
have to divert money already set aside for living expenses,
with negative consequences on their health and wellbeing,”
says David Do, AUSA Education Vice President.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>The
University voted to increase international fees at the same
time that services to international students are being
reduced.<p>
<p>The International Student information centre also
recently halved its opening hours until further notice, from
8:30 to 5pm weekdays to 9am to 2pm.</p>

<p>It has also been
revealed that additional student support for international
students is not linked to fees, but is contingent on the
number of students who use online visa renewal services at
the international student centre. If revenue from that
additional service is not fully realised, then support may
be reduced accordingly.<p>

<p>--</p>

<p>A resolution put forward by
student reps on Council, that it “recognise that tuition
fee increases have significant adverse social and economic
impacts on international students,” was also
lost.</p>

<p>Council also refused to even entertain the
alternatives put forward by students, such as flat-fee
grandparenting of international fees and lobbying for
increased government support for international students.<p>

<p>“Instead, the University continues to disingenuously
claim that it ‘grandparents’ its fees, when in fact it
continues to increase them every single year,” says David
Do.</p>

<p>Grandparenting means that tuition fees would be held
at the same level as that set for the programme of study
concerned at the time Council grandparents fees. This means
that a students fees would continue to increase while a
student is in the middle of their degree. AUT, Massey, and
Waikato universities grandparent their fees for their
international students.</p>

<p>“For the University to continue
using the word ‘grandparenting’ to describe its annual
review of its fees is incredibly disingenuous. International
students deserve better services, and more than that,
transparency from their institutions,” concludes David
Do.</p>
