     &lt;br&gt;Opportunity for biggest change to student voice since
</code></pre>
<p>VSM announced</p><p>Students are celebrating the Governments
announcement of a student voice consultation document at the
‘Voices of the Sector’ hui at Waikato University
today.</p><p>The consultation document asks questions around
three key themes, which in essence focus on the quality,
strength and independence of student voice, meanwhile
highlighting potential structure changes to further student
voice as a point of value for stakeholders and
decision-making in tertiary education.</p><p> “Ever since
Voluntary Student Membership came into effect in 2011,
student voice throughout the country has suffered
tremendously. The New Zealand Union of Students’
Associations have been pushing for changes to student voice
ever since this point, and although this has gotten harder
as our voice has weakened, we are extremely excited for this
opportunity to cordinate a response amongst student
organisations of Aotearoa New Zealand” – James Ranstead,
President of the New Zealand Union of Students’
Association.</p><p>“The Minister has refrained from suggesting
a return to Universal Student Membership is on the cards,
but students will be pushing for a system that reflects the
meaningful student representation that was capable before
VSM” said Sam Smith, Project Lead of the NZUSA Student
Voice Project Team.</p><p>The National Māori Students
Association Te Mana Ākonga agrees with the rationale and
high level aims of the consultation document.</p><p>“Māori
student voice can definitely be strengthened in Tertiary
Education. A review of Student Voice will undoubtedly show
that the Māori student voice is under-resourced and
undervalued, both at the regional and national level. This
is problematic for our multiple Māori Student Associations
who too often are left digging into their own pockets to
manaaki and tautoko their Tauira. This review has the
potential to increase resourcing which ultimately would
allow Te Mana Ākonga to better advocate for the needs of
our Tauira, creating safer and supportive environments for
Tauira Māori in Tertiary Education”.</p>

<p>The proposed
changes, too, are mostly reflective of the way the Aotearoa
student population is evolving.</p><p> “With a much greater
pool of Māori and Pacific students in the tertiary
education sector than previously, it is great that the
Government is taking a focus on this, likewise with disabled
students. It is however, disappointing to see that
international students are not included in the consultation
document whilst comprising 50,000 of our national student
pool, so we will be pushing hard for a change on this in our
submission” said Ranstead.</p><p>NZUSA partner the Tertiary
Education Union has also come out in support of todays
announcements.</p><p>Sharn Riggs, TEU National Secretary, noted
that student voice has been silenced and compromised since
the law changed in 2014 making membership of students’
associations voluntary. Riggs also welcomed Minister Hipkins
recognition that action must be taken and committed to
wide-ranging consultation to address these issues and ensure
a strong student voice for the future. The TEU will continue
to support the NZUSA and its members as they advocate for
their preferred approach to strengthen student voice.</p><p>The
consultation document will be soon uploaded on the Ministry
of Education kōrero mātauranga website. NZUSA and Te Mana
Ākonga will be mobilising student groups over the next
couple of months to ensure it is students that are driving
the discussion on this
topic.</p><p>ENDS
