step forward in reform</p>

<p>The TEU and its national
rūnanga, Te Toi Ahurangi, welcome the announcement Māori
will be included from the outset, as key partners in the
next stages of the Reform of Vocational Education process,
with the creation of Te Taumata Aronui – a Māori-Crown
tertiary education advisory group.</p>

<p>The new institute
promises to have governance that reflects the Māori-Crown
partnership and promotes national collaboration and
leadership with local solutions to regional issues, with a
responsibility to prioritise Māori learners.</p>

<p>TEU Te
Tumu Arataki - Māori vice-president, Hūhana Wātene, and
Te Mana Ākonga Tumuaki - President, Mamaeroa Merito say key
to the success of Te Taumata Aronui, is its impact under the
new one institution system, and the success of tauira
Māori, kaimahi Māori, iwi and hapori Māori, will be
ensuring direct lines of meaningful communication between
all groups included in the new governance structure.</p>

<p>“Our hope is that the new governance structure ensures
direct lines of communication between Te Taumata Aronui, the
Ministry of Education, the Tertiary Education Commission,
the new Transition Board and management structure. Clear
lines of communication will ensure the gains made by Māori
through the consultation process are not lost, and that the
Māori-Crown partnership is not only upheld and enhanced,
but embedded” Hūhana said.</p>

<p>Announcements made
today also include a review of funding rates for te reo
Māori and mātauranga Māori and the co-design of the one
institution with Wānanga. TEU Te Pou Tuarā , Lee Cooper
welcomes this review and the demarcation and honouring of
both te reo Māori and mātauranga Māori, but says the
co-design of the new system should be an all-of-sector
process. “Wānanga play an integral role in the protection
and revitalisation of te reo Māori and mātauranga Māori,
but we mustn’t exclude universities from the process. The
government has stated the new funding rates resulting from
the review will be applied to delivery across the entire
system, not just to the one institution and Wānanga,
therefore everyone needs to be involved”.<p>

<p>Both
Wātene and Cooper say TEU Māori members have expressed the
need for local culture to be maintained and respected under
the new, reformed structure of tertiary education. “A
charter with an enduring commitment to strong regional
campuses must also ensure an enduring commitment to regions
in governance and representation. This must extend to the
importance placed on the different mita and tikanga of iwi
in which the polytechnics are located, and ensuring this is
not lost at a local level under a coordinated national
system”.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Te Mana Ākonga Tumuaki
Mamaeroa Merito says, there is still much work ahead in
achieving equity in education in New Zealand, and in
honouring the relationship expressed in Te Tiriti o
Waitangi, “It’s great that Te Taumata Aronui is being
formed to prioritise the Māori learner in our tertiary
education system, but key to the success of our Māori
learners is increased numbers in Māori staffing at all
levels. That needs to be priority. We can’t talk about
Māori learners in isolation without also talking about
Māori staff - recruiters, support services, lecturers, and
those preparing Māori learners for their transition to
further education or work”.<br><p>
