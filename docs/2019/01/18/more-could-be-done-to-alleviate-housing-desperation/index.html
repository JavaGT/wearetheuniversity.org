     &lt;br&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;18 January 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘New renting
</code></pre>
<p>rules alleviate some difficulty in time of housing
desperation, but more could be done’ - NZUSA</p><p>The New
Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) says that
the changes to the Residential Tenancies Act and the
introduction of the Healthy Homes Act alleviate some
difficulty at one of the most difficult times of the year to
be a renting student, but more could be done.</p><p>With many
students going flatting for the first time or changing flats
amidst a housing crisis in our two main hubs Auckland and
Wellington, many extreme stories of desperation have been
arising, says James Ranstead, President of the New Zealand
Union of Students’ Associations.</p><p>Auckland University
Students Association President Anand Rama is seriously
concerned, ‘We are regularly getting students who are
struggling to find accommodation that they can afford, and
who are having to balance saving money by living further
away from the University with the increase in public
transport costs that this entails. This isn&#39;t just a problem
for students though, it’s a problem for Aotearoa, and our
future workforce in general.’</p><p>Victoria University of
Wellington Students’ Association President Tamatha Paul
agreed with the above comments, highlighting the need for
the prohibition of rent-bidding, a common practice at this
time of year.</p><p>Younited at Eastern Institute of Technology
President Dallas Adams says that rent price hikes not only
affect our major NZ cities, but also our regional
communities. ‘Napier/Hastings rent increases are among the
highest in the country which severely hurts the pockets of
our students, and more should be done to alleviate the
housing shortage’ says Adams.</p>

<p>‘Amidst this housing
shortage, many tenants are celebrating the recent and
proposed tenancy law changes. This includes the removal of
letting fees late last year which prevents landlords from
passing the cost of a letting fee onto a tenant, and the
proposal to limit rent increases to once per year. The Fees
free will also be assisting students through this
process’, says Ranstead</p><p>The Healthy Homes Act will
introduce standards for heating, insulation, ventilation,
moisture and drainage, and draught stopping, though many of
the legislative particulars are yet to be decided
upon.</p><p>‘With such a shortage in housing, students will
often take less than adequate housing as it is the only
option available, and so we encourage the Government to be
ambitious, and to set standards that care for our future
leaders and remove Aotearoa’s poor legacy of housing
quality compared to the likes of European countries’ says
Ranstead.</p><p>NZUSA believes an additional way that this can
be done is to enforce the need for a rental Warrant of
Fitness, currently a voluntary scheme in Wellington that has
also been trialled throughout the
country.</p><p>ENDS
