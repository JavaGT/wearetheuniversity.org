     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;13 February
</code></pre>
<p>2019</p><p><strong>Vocational Education set to change -
&#39;students must be the centre&#39;</strong></p><p>The bums on seats,
market driven approach to vocational education offering is
likely to change to a community needs based approach,
according to Education Minister Chris Hipkins in his <a href="http://www.students.org.nz/r?u=jHGEcXvs8EsTIWjQeNaHlRZmZCmXZEKPVMYYcgQ6c0R_Krt2W9m9uLyTBy9R7tvd--3ZNNCIJXXwuEi-PrkAWtHahjBPcb3kRBuSvMkVQLE&amp;e=96a217cc8fd583b68bf0086c230fcdc10c832467&amp;utm_source=students&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=vocational_education_release&amp;n=1" target="_blank">Reform of Vocational Education
announcement</a>today. A bold, single ‘New Zealand
Institute of Skills and Technology’ has been suggested as
the answer to New Zealand’s 16 ITP’s currently in
competition, a model that has led to future uncertainty with
hundreds of course closures and thousands of students
missing out on learning opportunities.</p><p>‘What we need in
New Zealand is a vocational education system that caters for
students of a diverse background, and for communities with
diverse needs. The idea of having Regional Leadership Groups
focusing on this as opposed to independent institute
councils focusing on competing against the neighbouring
institute will be much more effective, and should give
greater opportunity to fulfil our treaty responsibilities’
says James Ranstead, President of the New Zealand Union of
Students’ Associations.</p><p>The union is connecting up with
its member associations in the coming weeks to ensure a
consistent and coherent message on the sector reforms,
although many of its members were quick to respond to the
announcement today. &#39;The reforms are heading in the right
direction, however there was very little detail provided on
student voice. With the introduction of Voluntary Student
Membership in 2011, student voice and student leadership has
been stripped from ITP’s more than elsewhere. We look
forward to helping shape the student voice of a sector that
serves over 150,000 students annually, and encourage the
Government to seriously listen to our recommendations on
this&#39; said Poihaere Whare, President of the Students&#39;
Association of Waikato Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>President
of the Association of Students’ at the Universal College
of Learning Karla Davis is excited for this necessary
change, however stressed the importance of student support
throughout the process of change and within the final model,
saying 'students are our leaders of tomorrow'.</p><p>NZUSA will
be focusing heavily on student voice in their submission,
and although greater influence from industry has its
positive elements, it runs the risk of shutting out student
voice and leadership. 'We need a collaborative approach –
from the campus level, all the way through to the National
Governance framework of the New Zealand Institute of Skills
and Technology. This is our
opportunity'.</p><p>ENDS</p><p><br>
