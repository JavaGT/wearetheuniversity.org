<p>New Zealand's
Tertiary Education Union (TEU) is calling on the elected
Israeli and Palestinian governments to respect the peaceful
role that education institutions play in communities, and
keep their war out of Palestine's schools and tertiary
education institutions. The TEU condemns yesterday’s
deadly bombing of a Gaza school and the earlier the use of
Gaza’s Islamic University and the Training College as
targets for Israeli bomb attacks.<p>

<p>Yesterday’s attack on
a school in Jabaliya refugee camp reportedly killed 30 and
wounded many more. Meanwhile the extent of the damage to the
Islamic University, which has been hit by six air strikes in
recent days, is still unknown.  Luckily there were no
casualties, as the university was evacuated when the Israeli
assault began. The training college was less lucky, with 8
students killed and more injured in attacks on December
27.</p>

<p>“Israel's bombing of education institutions is a
horrific action in an increasingly horrific war,” said
Tangi Tipene, one of the TEU’s transitional presidents. 
“To retain our civility universities, schools and
education institutions need to be sanctuaries from
violence.”</p>

<p>The Islamic University was established in
1978 with the approval of Israeli authorities and is the
most important institution of higher education in Gaza,
serving more than 20,000 students, 60 percent of whom are
women.</p>

<p>“Children died in yesterday’s attack on a
school. We don’t know the reason for the attack but we do
know Israel claims the university was harbouring a suspected
arms depot for Hamas. It has given no evidence yet for this
claim, but if it is true that is tragic use of one of
Palestine's' most important cultural and educational
symbols,” said Tipene. “Hamas can hope for neither
victory nor peace if it turns the things it values into
military depots. Likewise Israel cannot hope to retain any
moral control over the war if it attacks the home of higher
learning in
Gaza.”</p>
