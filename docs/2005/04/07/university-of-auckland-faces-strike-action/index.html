University of Auckland faces prolonged industrial action
after union members voted by an overwhelming margin to take
strike action in protest at their Vice-Chancellor’s refusal
to participate in the negotiation of national collective
employment agreements and his giving non-union staff a 4.5
percent salary increase. <br>In a secret ballot held at a
stopwork meeting this morning, almost 500 union members
voted by a margin of over 97 percent to take industrial
action at the University, starting next Thursday with a
half-day strike. That will be followed by a series of
two-hour strikes over the following weeks, following which
union members will meet again, on 12 May, to consider
further action.<br>Speaking on behalf of the combined
university unions, AUS General Secretary Helen Kelly said
the strength of the vote, and the commitment to sustained
industrial action, was the most decisive statement that the
University’s staff could make to their Vice-Chancellor. “It
shows unmistakably that they are outraged by his behaviour,
and will not tolerate his calculated attempts to scuttle the
effort being undertaken by the unions to seriously resolve
the long-standing funding and salary issues which threaten
to compromise the university sector.”<br>Ms Kelly said the
dispute could be easily resolved if Vice-Chancellor now
accepted his legal obligations and participated in the
national bargaining process.<br>Meanwhile, the Employment
Court has agreed to hear with urgency the case being brought
by the AUS against the Vice-Chancellor, firstly with
evidence to be heard next Tuesday and Wednesday, and then
with closing submissions to follow in the first week of May.
The case will be heard before a panel of three judges.<br>In
the legal proceedings filed earlier in the Employment
Relations Authority, the AUS has alleged that the
Vice-Chancellor has acted unlawfully and is undermining
bargaining, not just by his refusal to participate in
multi-university negotiations, but also by offering the
salary increase to non-union staff on the eve of the
negotiations. It is also claiming that the move to give
non-union staff the 4.5 percent salary increase is
discriminatory.<br>Formal negotiations between the
university unions and the other six universities are
scheduled to get under way on 5 May, with six days set aside
during the month for negotiation.<p>
