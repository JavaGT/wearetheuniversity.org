"In other words, they are willing to squander the first real chance to get real engagement with government on salary issues, despite their consistent assertion that realistic salary levels are not affordable at current funding levels," said Professor Haworth. "As a result, we are concerned that vice-chancellors stand to undermine the first opportunity in fifteen years to find real solutions to the most serious problem facing the sector, that of paying competitive salaries and ensuring the recruitment and retention of high-quality staff."</p><p>"From the Minister's perspective, this must be disturbing, if only because the vice-chancellors' position is so clearly at odds with government's industrial relations and tertiary education policies," said Professor Haworth. "Staff and students will look askance at this because, for most, their world is not the competitive one promoted by the vice-chancellors."</p><p></p><p>Professor Haworth said that vice-chancellors had become isolated from the mainstream of thinking about the university sector in New Zealand, and their participation in the USG would provide an opportunity for them to reassert a position as innovative leaders in the sector.</p><p>The university unions today completed a round of meetings at seven universities which reaffirmed a decision to take sustained strike action in protect at the vice-chancellors refusal to agree to national collective employment agreements for staff and inadequate salary offers of between 2 and 4.5 percent.</p><p>The Government's University Salaries Group will hold its first meeting tomorrow (13 July) to discuss its membership and terms of reference.</p><p>ENDS</p><p></p></section></body>
