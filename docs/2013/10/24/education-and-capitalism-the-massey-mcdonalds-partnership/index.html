University has formed a partnership with McDonalds
Restaurants that will allow a number of McDonald’s store
managers to cross-credit their prior learning towards an
undergraduate business degree. An in-house course run for
McDonalds by an external provider, Service HQ, provides
managerial staff with the National Diploma in Hospitality, a
New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) accredited
qualification.</p>

<p>The head of Massey’s College of Business,
Professor Ted Zorn, told the New Zealand Herald “We have
gone in to McDonald’s and looked at what they are
doing…We assessed the content [of the in house training],
and found there was a pretty good fit with some of our
first-year papers.”</p>

<p>This agreement was initiated by
McDonalds, who approached several tertiary institutions
before selecting Massey, though director of teaching and
learning for Massey’s College of Business, Shirley Carr,
told Fairfax News that she hoped it was the first of many
such arrangements with companies as part of the
university’s drive to forge closer links with
business.</p>

<p>The situation is telling when it comes to how
education happens in what is sometimes referred to as late
capitalist society. The agreement has been decried by
supporters of the humanities and the social sciences, seen
as a further blow to the battered liberal arts education
that has suffered cuts as funding for science, technology
and trades education has increased. This publication aims to
provide a critical analysis of society, and as such
recognises the importance of the disciplines broadly defined
as ‘the arts’.<p>
<p>However, placing the arts as in
competition with other disciplines is not useful, given that
any society, capitalist or post-capitalism, will require
people with a diverse range of skills and knowledge-
including even some of the ‘management’ skills Massey
will teach McDonalds employees. A blended work and study
model of education is actually something that has been
advocated by Marxist educationists at various times in
history, and has been a demand of the organised labour
movement.</p>

<p>In addition to this, arguments that come from a
defence-of-arts perspective can veer toward an ahistorical
line that supposes a past where education in those
disciplines was provided widely and comprehensively, this
has never actually been the case, and education serving the
interests of the employing class is nothing
new.</p>

<p><b>Education and early capitalism</b></p>

<p>When
capitalism emerged in the United Kingdom it grew to become
the dominant economic system through mass production, which
divided the production of goods into a series of small
tasks, people concentrated in factories could be taught
quickly the task they needed to perform. Mass production is
much more efficient than individual production, and meant
wealth could be created in great excess to that required to
provide workers with the means of subsistence, which was
paid in wages.</p>

<p>At the time of the industrial revolution in
Britain people had little formal education, which was not
required for the new factory jobs. Primary education for
children was provided by churches with the support of
charity, and some public funding from the 1830s. Primary
education was not compulsory until 1870.</p>

<p>Secondary
education throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth
century consisted of grammar schools; academic schools
covered by student fees that prepared students for
university, and the new tax-funded technical schools,
providing students with the education required for new jobs
that had been created by industrialisation, but required
more skills than production line factory
labour.</p>

<p>Universities at this time remained elite
institutions, but the wealth created by capitalism meant a
small proportion of the population could be engaged in study
and research, this is the reason the nineteenth century is
also associated with great advancement in science as well as
industry. The social sciences- economics, sociology,
anthropology- also emerged at this time.</p>

<p>The British model
of education was spread to the colonies, including New
Zealand, and the two countries followed a similar path, both
making secondary education universal in 1944. Universal
secondary education had been a demand of the labour movement
and in the New Zealand context was among the reforms of the
first Labour government. Of course this was not as
comprehensive as secondary education today and many students
left at sixteen or even younger.</p>

<p><b>The post war
boom</b></p>

<p>In the economic boom following world war two a
substantial amount of society’s wealth was available, via
high taxation on the rich, for higher education and
research. In the USA in particular, this meant the huge
financial support for science and engineering which laid the
foundation for the space programme and the internet. Money
was also available for the arts, and when popular movements
pushed for new disciplines such a woman’s studies (gender
studies) and ethnic studies programs, these could be
provided.</p>

<p>Tertiary education in New Zealand was free, and
a prosperous economy meant students could choose their field
of study with little concern about the lack of career
options it provided, or fear of poorer economic wellbeing in
the future compared to studying an alternative. It’s
important to note however that the mid twentieth century
wasn’t a golden age of higher learning, today a third of
New Zealanders aged 55 to 64 have a tertiary qualification
compared to almost half for New Zealanders aged 25 to 35.
Secondary school examinations at this time were designed to
fail half of the students taking them, regardless of
ability, so university education was not an option for
many.</p>

<p><b>Neoliberalism</b></p>

<p>The post war economic boom
came to an end in the 1970s; in the decade following the
election of the infamous fourth Labour government in 1984
changes to what was provided by the state were made across
the board, including in education. In 1992 (under a National
government elected the previous year) tertiary education was
commoditised to an extent with the introduction of user
pays. The state would still fund each student to study, but
the student would pay a proportion of the costs
themselves.</p>

<p>With “user pays”, education became an
individual rather than a social responsibility. In line with
the ideology of individualism that accompanied neoliberal
economic reforms, students became consumers of education in
a marketplace. When secondary examinations changed to the
modern system of NCEA, which ended the arbitrary process of
failing perfectly capable students, those who studied a
discipline that didn’t lead to a prosperous career (along
with those who choose not to study at all) were seen as
making a poor choice, and ultimately responsible for further
low wages or unemployment.</p>

<p>The growth of some disciplines
and decline in others is not entirely the result of students
(incredibly restricted) choice. The capitalist class is
incredibly influential in what kind of education the state
funds, when politicians talk of matching education to the
needs of ‘business’ ‘the market’ or ‘the
economy’ what is literally meant is using public money to
educate workers to a level required to perform today’s
jobs. “Success in education is essential to the
Government’s goal of building a productive and competitive
economy.” Reads the State Services Commission website,
“It also helps New Zealanders develop the skills needed to
reach their full potential and contribute to the economy and
society.” Far from mere rhetoric, both these statements
are accurate.</p>

<p><b>Education today</b></p>

<p>As manufacturing
jobs continue to move overseas and other low skilled jobs
are automated, the New Zealand working class of the future
will need to be more highly skilled than previous
generations. This is why the current government has put
emphasis on increasing the number of 18 year olds with NCEA
Level 2, and the number of 25 year olds with a level 4
qualification, as well as from 2014 providing all level 1
and 2 courses to under 25 year olds for free- this is,
completely state funded, with not payment from students as
individuals.</p>

<p>To oppose the expansion of tertiary education
for the working class would be misguided, while the major
beneficiaries is the capitalist class, a worker also
benefits from increased education. Universal tertiary
education (though unlikely to be free education under
capitalism) is the direction New Zealand is heading in, and
the form that education takes is likely to be different than
tertiary education has been up until now.</p>

<p>As mentioned
previously, the blended model of work and study that
McDonalds managers will be undertaking is not dissimilar
than models advocated by Marxist thinkers on education, and
practised in the first decades of the Soviet Union.
Educational ideas oppositional to capitalism can become
absorbed into it – this has happened many times before-
though this doesn’t mean they suddenly become bad
ideas.</p>

<p>There are serious shortcomings with the
Massey-McDonalds scheme, the only ones with access to degree
level education subsided by McDonalds will be managers. In
practice managing operations and managing people are not
separate. While skills such as providing training and
overseeing payroll are essential in any workplace,
manager’s authority over workers means they can often join
the wrong side of industrial disputes -like the recent
McStrike campaign- education provision could mean more
managers seeing their interests with those of the
corporation rather than the rest of the work
force.</p>

<p>McDonalds likes to play up the fact that most of
their management -even at a senior level- have risen up from
the shop floor, but the hierarchical structure of the
business means the vast majority of workers will not advance
to that level and gain the opportunities that come with it.
McDonalds provides sub degree education (with NZQA
accredited hospitality qualifications) to all long serving
employees, though this is only the first step, not a
complete pathway to a hospitality career.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, a
scheme like this is not something to be opposed. The New
Zealand Nurses Organisation and the Service and Food Workers
Union have long advocated for an educational pathway for
aged care workers to become qualified nurses (arguably this
is far more socially necessary than training restaurant
managers) and there are many other industries where this
model could be applied.</p>

<p><b>Where does this leave the
arts?</b></p>

<p>Student groups and education unions have had
limited success in defensive campaigns to keep arts
education. While an arts education is valuable, it does not
necessarily have to be a thing apart from work or other
learning. Arts subjects could be provided alongside science
and/or practical training. With more people gaining tertiary
education, including through mixed work-study models,
perhaps the next step is for the various stakeholders in
education; students, educators, unions- to advocate for a
more comprehensive tertiary education, combining technical
and scientific subjects with social science and
humanities.</p>
