<p>‘Helen’s Law’ Will Ruin Get Ahead Hopes Of Thousands</p>
<p>Prime Minster Helen Clark ignored official advice on the negative impacts on Maori and Pacific Islanders of immigration changes a leaked report shows, said ACT Immigration spokesman Penny Webster.</p>
<p>It was revealed today that the Government was warned that Maori and Pacific Island people would be highly represented amongst those marginalised by the Helen Clark initiated changes to trans-tasman social security entitlements.</p>
<p>“Helen Clark has indicated that her government wanted the changes to the immigration policy despite warnings the policy would impact most on the unskilled, especially Maori and Pacific Islanders. It appears the government is building a wall to keep Labour voters stuck in New Zealand for life.</p>
<p>“When asked specifically whether the Government had received any warning regarding Maori and Pacific islanders, Miss Clark said, “If there are papers which some rat has given to you which says that, it would be pointing out the obvious. If unskilled people are going to Australia, they are the most likely to be affected and of course among those people, in New Zealand, are disproportionate numbers of Maori and Pacific Islanders.</p>
<p>”It appears that Helen Clark has unilaterally decided to ignore ‘the obvious’ and jeopardize the employment opportunities for unskilled New Zealanders, especially Maori and Pacific Islanders. Helen Clark has effectively regulated the labour market.</p>

<p>“The government’s chief social policy researcher, Simon Chapple, proved that flexible and free labour markets are the most successful method of reducing socio-economic disparities between New Zealanders. Helen Clark has chosen to ignore his advice as well.</p>
<p>“Unskilled workers, especially Maori and Pacific Island people, have had their safety net cut out from under them. If these people try to get ahead and seek work in Australia’s far larger labour market, and then strike an employment bad patch, Helen Clark’s decision means they have to come back to New Zealand or starve.</p>
<p>“The effects of ‘Helen’s Law’ will greatly influence the lives of unskilled New Zealanders,” said Penny Webster</p>
