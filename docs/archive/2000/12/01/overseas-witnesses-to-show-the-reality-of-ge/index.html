<p>Overseas Witnesses To Show The Reality Of GE, Not The Hype</p>
<p>Green Party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said today presentations from organics groups next week will start rebalancing the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification.</p>
<p>&quot;So far we have heard mainly from industry producers and research institutes who suggest that without this technology, New Zealand will slip behind the rest of the world into poverty and backwardness.</p>
<p>&quot;The organics industry will give us a much brighter view of the future without genetically engineered crops and animals - where New Zealand could lead the world in producing clean, green and safe food.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons said the evidence of overseas witnesses who had experienced the reality, not the hype, of genetically engineered crops would throw light on what genetic engineering really meant for farmers.</p>
<p>* Dr Ann Clark, Associate Professor in Plant Agriculture at Guelph University, has shown that GE crops in North America have not lived up to biotech promises of higher yields and less pesticide use. Appearing Monday 4th December</p>
<p>* Canola farmer Percy Schmeiser is locked in a legal battle with Monsanto over claims that he planted their seed illegally. He claims his crops were contaminated. Appearing Tuesday 5th December</p>
<p>* Head of the American Corn Growers Foundation, Gary Goldberg, says that his industry has lost over $200 million because they have been shut out of the European market. Appearing Tuesday 5th December</p>
