<p>Friday 15th Dec 2000 Owen Jennings Media Release -- Other</p>
<p>While the government should be commended for supporting the Apple and Pear Export Permits Committee, the problem facing the industry will only be resolved by making the far braver decision of deregulation, said ACT Rural Affairs spokesman Owen Jennings. ENZA took out a High Court injunction on the Apple and Pear Exports Permits Committee against issuing any further permits for independent apple exporters, until a hearing on December 18. After taking a legal opinion from the Crown law office, the government has decided to seek the court&#39;s permission to support the export permits committee&#39;s case “The problem in trying to settle the crisis through the court system is that the protagonists are likely to drag the issue through the courts at a time when, if independent exporting is to be a viable option, decisions must be made.</p>
<p>“Those growers who grow for specific markets e.g. the small fruit market, must make decisions about orchard management in the next seven days to ensure they produce the right fruit. Current delays are likely to see the loss of this fruitful market.</p>
<p>“Growers will be pleased that the government is backing it’s own, but would prefer their Minister showed strong leadership and made the bold move of deregulation,” said Owen Jennings.</p>
