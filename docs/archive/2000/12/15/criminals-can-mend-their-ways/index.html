<p>Media Release</p>
<p>15 December 2000</p>
<p>CRIMINALS CAN MEND THEIR WAYS</p>
<p>Experience gained from the first 12 months of trialling new offender help called Turnaround Waimakariri has achieved outstanding success and is a credit to those involved claimed Ron Mark MP and spokesman for Law and Order for New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“With the benefit of this valuable experience and very successful outcome Turnaround can be recommended for extension to other areas within New Zealand,” said Mr Mark.</p>
<p>“Turnaround has been trialled in 3 pilot areas of Timaru, Waitakere and Waimakariri. The Waimakariri result with which I am most familiar, was greater than may have anticipated with a low re-offending rate of just 3.6%. This holds tremendous hope for the future of many thousands of young New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“I commend Mr John Banks, Turnaround Co-ordinator for Waimakariri, and his team for their remarkable success and their dogged determination to take on such onerous tasks I also urge the Police Minister, Hon George Hawkins, and his Justice colleague, Hon Phil Goff to find the funding to expand the programme as quickly as possible,” concluded Mr Mark.</p>
