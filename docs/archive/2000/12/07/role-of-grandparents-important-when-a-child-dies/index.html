<p>New research illustrates how grandparents offer crucial support to their family when a grandchild dies.</p>
<p>Victoria University PhD student, Alison Stewart, explored the issue of grandparent bereavement and found that when a child dies the focus of health professional and the wider community is almost exclusively on the bereaved parents.</p>
<p>In contrast grandparents have been called the &quot;forgotten grievers&quot;, and Stewart asks - are grandparents &quot;forgotten&#39;? and, if so, by whom?</p>
<p>Stewart has worked with families in both New Zealand and the UK in various areas of bereavement for the last 15 years and found that bereavement wasn&#39;t just about death, but, about the loss of a dream of a healthy baby. While working with families she noted a &quot;ripple effect&quot; of bereavement which extends to other family members who are often unacknowledged.</p>
<p>Stewart discussed, through interviews and letters, with 26 grandparents, parents and health/bereavement professionals the context in which grandparents constructed the unexpected death of an infant grandchild.</p>
<p>In particular, grandparents shared stories and memories with the parents and other siblings. As the months and years pass this helps to create a place within the family for a continuing relationship with the grandchild who died.</p>
<p>Stewart found that for some grandparents bereavement doesn&#39;t &quot;end&quot; or reach &quot;acceptance&quot;, instead it is about learning to live with the death.</p>
<p>She says that in their role as &quot;parents of the parents&#39; grandparents often placed their own pain and preferences second to their wish to support and be with the parents.</p>
<p>Parents and health professionals appreciated the support that grandparents offered at a time, when they, too, were bereaved. It was outside the family where many grandparents found friends, colleagues or their community forgot, or chose not to acknowledge their bereavement.  </p>
