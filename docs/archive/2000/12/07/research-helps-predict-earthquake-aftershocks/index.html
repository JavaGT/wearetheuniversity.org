<p><strong>Thursday, 7 December 2000, 4:00 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>A Victoria University student has developed a model that will help predict the expected occurrence of aftershocks after a large earthquake has occurred.</p>
<p>As part of her work for her PhD thesis, Annemarie Christophersen developed a model which statistically predicts the numbers of aftershocks of different sizes and in different time intervals following a large shallow earthquake.</p>
<p>As an example, her thesis determined the chance of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake in New Zealand being followed by an aftershock of more than magnitude 6 within seven days was 38 percent. The probability increased to 42 percent within 14 days and to 46 percent within 30 days.</p>
<p>The model was derived from a global database of earthquake sequences and has small but significant differences for different geological settings which means it can be used anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The research had to overcome the diversity of aftershock sequences: sometimes many aftershocks occur, sometimes few. Christophersen&#39;s model successfully deals with this diversity and was shown to accurately match the actual occurrence of large aftershocks of various sizes.</p>
<p>Her work is expected to have two immediate applications: forecasting for insurance purposes the expected occurrence of aftershocks which might cause damage and advising emergency managers on the likely further occurrence of aftershocks after a large earthquake has occurred.</p>
<p>The idea for Christophersen&#39;s thesis came from David Middleton the general manager of the New Zealand Earthquake Commission and her project was supported by the Commission.  </p>
