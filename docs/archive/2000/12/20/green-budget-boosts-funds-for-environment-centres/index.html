<p><strong>Wednesday, 20 December 2000, 1:59 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Green Party Co-Leader Rod Donald said he was delighted that the $300,000 initiative to fund and set up environment centres as part of the Green Budget Package has come to fruition.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s announcement by the Greens and the Government to establish the fund is a well deserved Christmas present for the country&#39;s environment centres,&quot; said Mr Donald.</p>
<p>The $300,000, from Vote Environment, will make grants of up to $50,000 per centre to assist them with day to day running costs such as administration and rent.</p>
<p>Mr Donald said the extra funding was a low-cost way to recognise the value of community environment centres and to give these centres some certainty, security and above all encouragement.</p>
<p>&quot;Community environment centres are the public face of the environment and conservation movements in many communities and they play a very important role in providing information to the public, especially school students, and in co-ordinating local environmental initiatives,&quot; said Mr Donald.</p>
<p>Mr Donald said community environment centres were a valuable resource for schools and often assisted the Department of Conservation, the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority, the Ministry of the Environment and local councils in distributing information.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greens have supported an investment in environmental centres to build up community understanding and support for conserving nature and looking after the environment,&quot; said Mr Donald.</p>
<p>Rod Donald said he was thrilled the last of the Green Party&#39;s initiatives have also been signed off including the provision of $1 million for environmental legal aid, social and environmental reporting, environmental accounting measures and the launch of a pesticide reduction programme.</p>
