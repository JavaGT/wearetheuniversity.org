<p>Tuesday 19th Dec 2000</p>
<p>Social Welfare spending is expected to increase $1.5 billion during Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey’s term of office, yet he still insists on misrepresenting the WINZ Employment register, said ACT Employment Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman.</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s December Economic &amp; Fiscal Update released today shows Treasury is forecasting that spending, and numbers on the unemployment benefit, will rise every year until 2005.</p>
<p>“Steve Maharey is attempting to spin-doctor success out of failure. He is claiming credit for more WINZ work placements when in reality all he has done is change the computer program.</p>
<p>“WINZ is now claiming credit for hundreds of job seekers who find employment within 6 weeks of doing a WINZ activity. Thousands more unemployed find their own jobs every year than WINZ places, but under Mr Maharey many of these self placements are now claimed by WINZ.</p>
<p>“So the placement statistics look good, but they mean very little. Around 50% of the unemployed are now out of work a year, the worst in our history</p>
<p>“This is a Minister who does not understand his portfolio.</p>
<p>“I predict three clear outcomes from Mr Maharey’s incompetence.</p>
<p>* He will claim huge increases in the number of long term registered unemployed placed into stable employment, even though half of them re-register.</p>
<p>* Christine Rankin will gain a new contract based partly on the basis of this “success.”</p>
<p>* And the registered long term unemployed over 1 year, the people WINZ was set up to help, will have gone up by around twenty thousand.</p>
<p>“These will be Mr Maharey’s achievements,” said Muriel Newman.</p>
