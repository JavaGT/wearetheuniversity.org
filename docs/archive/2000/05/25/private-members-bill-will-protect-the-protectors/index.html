<p>Paul Hutchison<br>MP for Port Waikato</p>
<p>25 May 2000</p>
<p>Private members bill will protect the protectors</p>
<p>Police would gain a greater level of protection under a bill submitted to the ballot today by National MP Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>The Police (Conditional) Name Protection Bill would protect the identity of officers involved in firearms incidents during the course of their duties - until such time as a Police Complaints Authority investigation is completed.</p>
<p>Dr Hutchison says in a small country like New Zealand there&#39;s a real risk that a police officer or their family could be placed in real danger if their name is published before the facts of an incident have been established.</p>
<p>&quot;The Waitara shooting was a sharp reminder of that potential danger - with the officer involved and his family effectively driven into hiding,&quot; Dr Hutchison says.</p>
<p>&quot;In that case the courts ruled name publication was allowed - the High Court&#39;s ruling saying &#39;There can be no right of privacy in respect of an action by a police officer in the course of his public duties in a public street&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;My bill reflects the fact New Zealand Police take on extraordinary risks in the course of their duties.</p>
<p>&quot;It is only natural justice that they and their families should not be further penalised or endangered by having their names published,&#39; Paul Hutchison says.</p>
