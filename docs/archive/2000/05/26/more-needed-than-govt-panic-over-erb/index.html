<p>Max Bradford<br>Opposition Industrial Relations Spokesperson</p>
<p>26 May 2000</p>
<p>More needed than Govt panic over ERB</p>
<p>The Government needs more than a fit of panic to sort out the problems in the Employment Relations Bill, Opposition Industrial Relations spokesperson Max Bradford said today.</p>
<p>&quot;For the past two months Government MPs have been told the Bill is unworkable, costly and too academic, but have refused to listen.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s hard to take seriously that they&#39;ve had a sudden change of heart.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past few days all we have had is the Government scurrying around trying to allay fears.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no clear signs there will be meaningful change. In fact all we have is the Minister of Labour saying she will clarify the intentions in the Bill.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Government wants to show it&#39;s serious about listening to the public&#39;s view of the Employment Relations Bill is must heed Jenny Shipley&#39;s call to go back to the drawing board completely.&quot;</p>
