<p>Shared Parenting Bill Defeat Stifles Debate Says Nat</p>
<p>The defeat of the Shared Parenting Bill in Parliament last night just reiterates the Labour/Alliance &#39;we know best&#39; approach to government says Auckland National MP Belinda Vernon.</p>
<p>&quot;Shared parenting is an important issue. It has touched the hearts and minds of thousands of New Zealanders. They have a right to have their say. But tonight certain parties in Parliament did their best to stop them.</p>
<p>&quot;Virtually all those who voted against the Bill said they supported the sentiment, but didn&#39;t think it would work and thought they could figure out a better solution.</p>
<p>&quot;They weren&#39;t interested in hearing from those affected by the current law. They weren&#39;t interested in letting New Zealanders express their frustration with a system that has failed them.</p>
<p>&quot;No, they were bought off by a Government promise to review the Guardianship Act.</p>
<p>&quot;There were compelling reasons for the Bill to go to a Select Committee. Not the least that there is a constituency of support in the community for Parliament to consider the issue in more than a perfunctory manner.</p>
<p>&quot;There are lots of people hurting over this issue. Frustration is festering. I have been surprised at the level of unhappiness in the community on this issue. Stifling debate is not the answer.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been overwhelmed by the number of parents, particularly fathers, and grandparents who have expressed their helplessness and frustration with the inadequacies of the present system.</p>
<p>&quot;I am pleased that a petition on the issue was tabled in Parliament yesterday and that a Select Committee will now consider the broader issue. But it is a second best option to making submissions on a specific piece of legislation.&quot;</p>
