<p><strong>Monday, 1 May 2000, 6:00 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Aotearoa_Post_Compulsory_Student_Union">Aotearoa Post Compulsory Student Union</a></strong></p>
<p>Talk of universal student allowances at the weekend&#39;s National Party regional conference has been welcomed by the national student union, the Aotearoa Post-compulsory Student Union (APSU).</p>
<p>National Party deputy leader Wyatt Creech said the National Party would begin a &quot;searching review&quot; of policy and will look at universal allowances as part of that review.</p>
<p>&quot;APSU has argued for a long time it is grossly unfair to punish people for studying by denying them access to living support,&quot; said David Penney, National President of APSU.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Creech&#39;s comments on the weekend regarding universal allowances means National is moving closer to the policy position held by the majority (Alliance, Greens, NZ First, United) of political parties in Parliament.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the National Party will continue to think about supporting - rather than punishing - people who are bettering themselves. We also hope that the National Party will look again at its policies on Student Loans.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Given that a &#39;radical conservative&#39; party is looking seriously at universal allowances, we believe it is only logical that the centre-left Labour Party in Government should act,&quot; concluded David Penney.</p>
