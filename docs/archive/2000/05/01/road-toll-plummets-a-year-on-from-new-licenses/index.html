<p>National MP for Pakuranga</p>

<p>Road toll plummets one year on from new driver licensing</p>
<p>&quot;Today marks the first full year of the new driver licence system and the road toll results speak for themselves,&quot; Pakuranga MP and former Transport Minister, Maurice Williamson said today.</p>
<p>For the 12 months ended 30 April 2000 the total number of people killed on our roads has dropped to a record low of 479*.</p>
<p>For the previous 12 months to 30 April 1999 the road toll was 521.</p>
<p>&quot;This reduction of 42 fatalities per annum represents an 8.1% drop. It puts the number of deaths at the lowest level since records were kept. Such a massive plummet in the annual road toll figures is unprecedented.</p>
<p>&quot;42 fewer deaths, and a huge decrease in serious injuries, is more than enough justification for the introduction of the new driver licensing system, which is standard anywhere else in the world. &quot;The new penalties that go with the system are working. &quot;The tough penalties for those caught driving in excess of 50kms over the speed limit who lose their licence, and the confiscation of thousands of vehicles from unlicensed drivers are making our roads safer. &quot;Several key talk-back hosts should now apologise. Their adamant claims that the new driver licensing system would not have any effect on our road toll have been proven very wrong by the facts. I will listen with great interest, but little expectation, to see if they even mention this wonderful outcome.&quot;</p>
