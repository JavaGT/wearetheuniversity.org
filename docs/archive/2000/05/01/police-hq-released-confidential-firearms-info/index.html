<p><strong>Monday, 1 May 2000, 9:51 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Media Release</p>
<p>30 April 2000</p>
<p>POLICE HQ RELEASED CONFIDENTIAL FIREARMS INFORMATION</p>
<p>Police National Headquarters released confidential details of registered firearms owners to an outside company for relicencing checks, the New Zealand First Law and Order spokesperson, Ron Mark, revealed today.</p>
<p>Last week Mr Mark claimed that registered firearms owners and collectors are being targeted by criminals who appeared to have access to firearms information that should be confidential only to Police.</p>
<p>“We have now learned that Police Headquarters contracted out inquiry work relating to the relicencing of firearms.</p>
<p>“At least one thousand names, addresses and telephone numbers, plus details of firearms licences were handed over to Baynet CRA Ltd, which is the information and reporting division of Baycorp Holdings Ltd.</p>
<p>“In a number of cases Police mistakenly gave out details of people who had already relicenced, including some restricted firearms owners who were alarmed to receive telephone calls seeking sensitive information. They believed that Police would keep their details confidential.”</p>
<p>Mr Mark said that confidential information about firearms should be kept under strict security and he sought an assurance that no details could have been released during the relicencing operation.</p>
<p>Today he released copies of letters from a firearms owner and Police Headquarters confirming the release of the confidential firearms information.</p>
