<p>Tony Ryall</p>
<p>National&#39;s Justice Spokesman</p>
<p>29 May 2000</p>
<p>ERB mess repeated with matrimonial property legislation</p>
<p>Cabinet will also have to back down on changes to matrimonial property laws proposed by Attorney General Margaret Wilson to avoid &#39;unintended consequences&#39;, says National&#39;s Justice spokesman Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;Professor Wilson&#39;s proposals to change the rules for dealing with matrimonial property will also lead to practical problems. The Government didn&#39;t want public submissions but yielded after pressure from all opposition parties.</p>
<p>&quot;But the two month select committee process is not long enough to do a good job on the detailed wording of the changes. The devil is in the detail.</p>
<p>&quot;The matrimonial property changes will be the Employment Relations Bill all over again - impractical legislation, hurriedly drafted and not enough consultation resulting in &#39;unintended consequences&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;National does agree with improving spousal maintenance provisions to provide better balance where one partner has, for example, given up their career for child-rearing. But we are concerned about breaching the 50/50 split, and we don&#39;t think the Government is prepared to properly fund the extra legal aid and Family Court costs associated with their proposals.</p>
<p>&quot;Cabinet should slow down and get it right. They should also instruct Professor Wilson to release all Ministry of Justice and Family Law Section advice on the changes proposed,&quot; Mr Ryall said.</p>
