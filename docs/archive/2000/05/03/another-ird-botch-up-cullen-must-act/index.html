<p><strong>Wednesday, 3 May 2000, 4:21 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of taxpayers are in for another shock courtesy of another IRD mistake - this time on IR3 tax forms, Opposition Revenue spokesperson Annabel Young said today.</p>
<p>&quot;IRD has admitted it has made a botch up with the instructions to people working out their ACC bill on the IR3 tax forms.</p>
<p>&quot;IRD has used the wrong figures to help people work out their ACC and that means some taxpayers could end up calculating frighteningly large ACC bills.</p>
<p>&quot;And all the IRD is doing about it is saying sorry.</p>
<p>&quot;IRD needs to do more to help rebuild its credibility.</p>
<p>&quot;Revenue Minister Michael Cullen must take more responsibility for his Department&#39;s problems. He needs to ensure the Department takes more action to make certain taxpayers know about the mistake.</p>
<p>&quot;If the IRD wants people to have confidence in what it is doing it must either reprint the forms, or at least send a letter fixing the mistakes to every taxpayer concerned.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister can&#39;t sit back and watch - he must make certain the IRD does something more to inform people about the mistakes.&quot;</p>
