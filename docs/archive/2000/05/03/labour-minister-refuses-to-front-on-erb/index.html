<p><strong>Wednesday, 3 May 2000, 4:20 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>&quot;The Labour Minister is revealing contempt of the democratic process with her refusal to front to the select committee on the Employment Relations Bill,&quot; Opposition Industrial Relations spokesperson Max Bradford said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister of Labour has today told Parliament she is not willing to come to the select committee to explain the policy intentions behind the Employment Relations Bill.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#39;s she afraid of?</p>
<p>&quot;She has already admitted that the Bill is not perfect. The reality is it&#39;s unworkable.</p>
<p>&quot;All over the country employers, lawyers and experts are astounded at how academic and theoretic the law change is and that it won&#39;t work in practice.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister must front - even if she finds it difficult to face the criticism.</p>
<p>&quot;It is highly unusual for a Minister to be unwilling to clarify and inform the select committee about their legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;She&#39;s prepared to talk to over 50 groups of unions and employers, but not to the select committee.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government does not want the select committee scrutiny of the Employment Relations Bill to be carried out in a fair, informed and democratic manner.</p>
<p>&quot;A pattern of abuse of the select committee process is developing.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ve already had the select committee chair briefing unions on the tactics to ensure the Bill gets passed - including telling them he will arrange for their submissions to be heard during the daytime when the media is there.</p>
<p>&quot;And the select committee chair won&#39;t let Treasury appear either to explain the economic impact of the Bill.&quot;</p>
