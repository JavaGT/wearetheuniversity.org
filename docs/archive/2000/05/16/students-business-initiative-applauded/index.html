<p>Otahuhu College Students&#39; Business Initiative Applauded</p>
<p>Manurewa MP Hon. George Hawkins has applauded students of Otahuhu College for their excellent presentations during the Lion Business Experience Expo on Friday.</p>
<p>The Lion Business Experience Expo gave Otahuhu College students the opportunity to consider a viable business enterprise, invent an innovative product, present a financial business plan and a SWOT analysis and marketing plan.</p>
<p>George Hawkins was a judge of eight teams presenting their business ideas. The students certainly picked up the challenges of creativity and innovation that is so important in the business world, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I was thoroughly impressed with the ideas that these students presented to me. The products that the students invented displayed a sound understanding of technology applied to things consumers need,&quot; George Hawkins said.</p>
<p>He said the marketing plans considered who best to target the new products at and how this would best be achieved.</p>
<p>&quot;The presentations were well thought through and well conceived. I want to congratulate Otahuhu College for this excellent Expo.</p>
<p>&quot;I am convinced that many of these students, should they choose a career in business, will achieve much. Some certainly showed a determined freshness that would be the envy of many already established business people,&quot; George Hawkins said.</p>
