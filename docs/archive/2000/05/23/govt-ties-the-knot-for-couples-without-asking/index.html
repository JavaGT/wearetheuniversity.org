<p><strong>Tuesday, 23 May 2000, 2:18 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Govt Ties The Knot For Couples Without Asking Their Opinion First</p>
<p>Thousands of New Zealanders will find themselves financially married under new matrimonial property laws without the chance to say I do or I don&#39;t, says National&#39;s Justice Spokesman Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>National is joining with Act and United in calling for the Government to refer its changes to a select committee.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government&#39;s proposals will have a huge impact on the lives of many New Zealanders and the changes should not be bulldozed through without a chance for them to have their say. We will agree to a shorter consultation process but the proposals must go before a select committee for public comment.</p>
<p>&quot;National has a number of concerns about the Bill. If passed in its present form, it will see most matrimonial disputes ending up in court - only 10% do now. These cases will take years to solve and will be a new gravy train for legal aid lawyers.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bill undermines the long-standing 50/50 split rule, and changes the clean break principle so that one partner will end up paying alimony way beyond the boundaries today.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government should relent and refer the Bill to a select committee before it irrevocably wreaks havoc on unsuspecting New Zealander&#39;s property rights,&quot; Mr Ryall said.</p>
