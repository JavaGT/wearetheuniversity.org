<p><strong>Tuesday, 23 May 2000, 7:01 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>It will take more than a tactical olive branch to fix the problem the Government has with economic policy, National Finance spokesperson Bill English said today.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s families who are hardest hit and that&#39;s what is driving the concern. Many families just see higher interest rates, higher petrol prices, a new tobacco tax and flat house prices. They are starting to see disruption and uncertainty in their workplace and Government largesse for special interest groups.</p>
<p>&quot;They also see their friends and family leaving New Zealand in large numbers and a Government more concerned about doing deals with its mates than about the national interest.</p>
<p>&quot;They can also see the Government divided over basic issues like the Reserve Bank and they don&#39;t get any comfort from the idea that Jim Anderton might get to set their rates instead.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government&#39;s problem with business is just as deep-seated. Dr Cullen has decried almost any business point of view as extreme, and even before the election warned them to co-operate with Labour or else. Why will people who have been abused and threatened suddenly believe Dr Cullen has changed his spots?</p>
<p>&quot;This government of university lecturers has no idea of the values and the reality of business, and that can&#39;t be fixed.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Cullen and Helen Clark need to understand it&#39;s the real effect on people&#39;s pockets and jobs and families that is driving concern about economic policy, not just a few Right wing extremists.</p>
