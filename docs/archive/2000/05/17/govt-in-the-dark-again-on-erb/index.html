<p><strong>Wednesday, 17 May 2000, 5:53 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Another Government Minister has revealed he&#39;s in the dark over the impact of the Employment Relations Bill, Opposition Industrial Relations spokesperson Max Bradford said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister of State Services showed in Parliament he doesn&#39;t know that thousands of public servants and teachers could have their existing right to be part of a collective agreement without being a union member ripped away from them.</p>
<p>&quot;The PSA has always been a purely voluntary union. So has the NZEI for the last 140 years. Yet on August 1 public servants will lose the rights they currently have.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government simply has no understanding of the practical implications of the Employment Relations Bill.</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard joins his colleague Labour Minister Margaret Wilson in failing to realise how far reaching the Bill is.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of giving public servants and teachers a choice this Government is forcing them all to become members of a union, if they want to experience their present right to be part of a collective contract.&quot;</p>
