<p>Industry Bill Window-Dressing For Damaging Policies</p>
<p>A new law introduced into Parliament today creating yet another government agency is just window dressing to cover over the economic destruction currently being caused by the Labour-Alliance policies, National&#39;s Industry Spokesperson John Luxton said today.</p>
<p>&quot;After being given the strongest growing economy of any incoming government in New Zealand&#39;s history, this Government seeks to paint the appearance of being industry friendly.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s trying to cover-up the lack of vision in the policies it&#39;s announced to date.</p>
<p>&quot;If Jim Anderton thinks that his new agency will create jobs, he must be dreaming.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost every policy implemented by this Government has been about making it more difficult for business and it shows.</p>
<p>* Today&#39;s unemployment figures have risen for the first time in 15 months now up to 6.4%. * Canterbury Manufacturers&#39; report lower confidence in their latest survey. * Industry has been very concerned by the Government&#39;s policies that have increased taxes and are about to increase ACC costs. * The Employment Relations Bill is scary to Industry. * The West Coast decisions are having repercussions across New Zealand&#39;s furniture industry and on one of the few viable industries on the Coast.</p>
<p>&quot;The Economic Development (INZ &amp; ME Dev) Bill is surely only window dressing over what is beginning to look like a major destruction of NZ industry under the policies of this visionless Government.&quot;</p>
