<p><strong>Thursday, 18 May 2000, 2:51 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>A programme aimed at taking away some of the mysteries of university study will be held at Victoria University on Saturday, May 27.</p>
<p>The New Start programme is aimed at adult students who haven’t had the opportunity to study at university due to personal circumstances and who now want to gain new skills and for people who either thought that university study wasn’t for them or who didn’t know where and how to begin.</p>
<p>Kate Brownsword from Victoria University’s Liaison Office says the New Start programme is an ideal opportunity for people to learn about the details of university enrolment in a supportive environment.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea of university study can be confusing and intimidating to some people, the New Start programme gives them a chance to see first hand what university is like and provides an opportunity to ask questions, get information and learn from others who have given it a go&quot;, she says.</p>
<p>Brownsword says that the one day programme includes a range of helpful and instructional events aimed at raising comfort levels and breaking down the barriers to action for prospective students.</p>
<p>The days events include two ‘mini’ lectures on Remembering the Anzacs and New Zealand English, a student panel and workshops on Practical Hints and Study Skills plus information on enrolment and course planning.</p>
<p>The New Start programme runs from 9.30am - 2pm on Saturday, 27 May. Anyone wishing to attend should phone 0800 VIC UNI.  </p>
