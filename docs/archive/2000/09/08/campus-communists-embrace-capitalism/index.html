<p><strong>Friday, 8 September 2000, 10:27 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels">Prebble&#39;s Rebels</a></strong></p>
<p>A group of campus communists at Waikato University have totally lost the plot with their anti-trade fundraising activities, Prebble’s Rebels president Clint Heine said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The communist group want to send two of their members to Melbourne to protest against free trade. But in order to raise money, the group is actually participating in free trade by selling barbecue sausages. The irony of this situation seems to have escaped this deluded group,&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>
<p>&quot;The simple act of selling a sausage is a fine example of capitalism and free trade. There’s a willing buyer and a willing seller, and when a transaction is made both parties are better off. How can you oppose free trade when you practice it yourself?&quot; Mr Heine asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The communists would probably be horrified if they realised there was no government intervention in their business – there’s no Ministry of Sausages to regulate the process, but Jim Anderton is probably developing one and the Greens are no doubt working to have sausages banned altogether,&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>
<p>Mr Heine said the group was also using other benefits of capitalism to aid their venture. &quot;A newspaper photo showed a communist cooking sausages made by a private company over what looked like an imported barbecue. Even the anti-trade t-shirt the guy was wearing was probably made in China. If they ever raise enough money to go to Australia, they’ll fly on a privately-owned airline using American-made planes. Activists like this benefit from capitalism every day but are too befuddled to realise it. I’m amazed the media continue to waste ink on this nutty group,&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>

<p>&quot;This is just another reason why membership of the Waikato Students’ Union should remain voluntary. If membership was compulsory, the association would have loads of money and students would have to pay for these protesters to fly to Australia in the same way Auckland students had to pay to send student politicians to Cuba. At least now the communists actually have to work for their money,&quot; Mr Heine concluded.</p>
