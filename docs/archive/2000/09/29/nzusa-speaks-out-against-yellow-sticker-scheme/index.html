<p><strong>Friday, 29 September 2000, 12:53 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>University Students Association Comes Out Against Police Yellow Triangle Sticker Scheme</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) has joined several youth and community organisations, Members of Parliament, health sector workers and celebrities in opposing the police&#39;s Under 25 Scheme.</p>
<p>The Under 25 Scheme is a programme run by the New Zealand Police, in which motorists that are over 25 years of age are encouraged to display yellow triangle stickers on the car to deter car thieves. If the police see someone who looks under the age of 25 driving the car, they can stop and demand identification.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased to join the many voices against this discriminatory scheme,&quot; said Sam Huggard, Co President of NZUSA. &quot;This scheme negatively stereotypes young people and sets a dangerous precedent for discrimination against young people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Young people cannot have the stickers on their cars, so the scheme redirects and increases car theft towards young people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What&#39;s more, the police appear to have no real evidence that this scheme is working, yet they are expanding into new centers at a rapid rate. The Human Rights Commission has not yet given advice on the scheme, but the police seem happy to press ahead. We are heartened that the Wellington Police have rejected this scheme, and can only hope that other centers will do the same,&quot; said Sam Huggard.</p>
<p>&quot;NZUSA discussed the issue at our recent conference in Dunedin and a motion was passed with overwhelming support to oppose the scheme at all stages,&quot; concluded Sam Huggard.</p>
