<p><strong>Monday, 4 September 2000, 12:24 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels">Prebble&#39;s Rebels</a></strong></p>
<p>New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) has come under fire, being accused of hypocrisy for increasing their own fees while offering student money to compulsory membership campaigns.</p>
<p>The President of Prebble&#39;s Rebels, Clint Heine, said &quot;if student associations are serious about cutting the cost of tertiary education, they should look to their own fees first.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;While NZUSA claims to be concerned over possible rises in student service levies they have given a silent nod to increases in the fee their member associations take from students.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The most apalling example of this is Otago University Students Association, which has raised its compulsory fee for 2001 by 23%, a hypocritical move which is hardly compatible with their supposed aim to reduce the cost of attending university.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Heine said that NZUSA has also offered to donate money to student associations at Auckland and Waikato Universities, to help them run campaigns about compulsory membership.</p>
<p>Mr Heine said &quot;accepting this offer would mean students are no longer just paying for the association elite on their own campus, but are also acting as a crutch for the country&#39;s other failing student unions.&quot;</p>
