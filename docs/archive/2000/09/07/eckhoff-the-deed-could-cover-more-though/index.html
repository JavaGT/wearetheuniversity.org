<p>Eckhoff: The Deed Could Cover More Though</p>
<p>Thursday 7th Sep 2000 Gerry Eckhoff Media Release -- Other</p>
<p>ACT MP and Central Otago resident, Gerry Eckhoff, hopes the Deed signed today by Contact Energy and the Government does not abdicate blame or remove local residents claims for further compensation.</p>
<p>The Deed formalised the contributions each side would pay towards addressing the flood problems of Alexandra and surrounding areas. Alexandra has flooded three times in five years, the most recent in November last year.</p>
<p>“I welcome the assistance to the Alexandra community, but residents should pay special attention to the fine print. If the West Coast deal is the coalition’s benchmark, the truth is undoubtedly in the detail. When bribing the West Coast, the Government made locals sign away any future rights for litigation.</p>
<p>“The deal does not seem to address the long term problem of the silt build up at the Roxburgh dam. Will Contact be implementing a silt reduction scheme or perhaps dredging selected spots along the river as suggested in an independent report by Alex Adams.</p>
<p>“Further the deed does not address residual problems affecting residents down stream of Roxburgh’s dam. These problems arise due to flushing, which causes river bank damage and lowers property values.</p>
<p>“After the huge profits huge profits made from the Roxburgh dam the amount agreed seems to be the smallest amount possible that Contact could give in an effort to maintain good will.</p>
<p>“I am pleased that those directly affected will be able to start their lives again in a safe environment,” said Gerry Eckhoff. ENDS</p>
