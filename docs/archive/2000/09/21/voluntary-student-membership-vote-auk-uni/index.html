<p><strong>Thursday, 21 September 2000, 4:22 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_Students_Association">Auckland University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Auckland University Students to vote again on Voluntary or Compulsory Student Membership.</p>
<p>The Auckland University Students Association (AUSA) has collected the necessary number of signatures to request the Univesity Council to hold another referendum on the future status of AUSA.</p>
<p>Last year in May, as a result of governemnt legislation, students&#39; associations around the country were forced to have a vote on whether the students in each institution which to have their students association remain compulsory or become voluntary.</p>
<p>The postal ballot referendum at Auckland will be open from October 1st thru November 1st. As a result of the change to the Education Act, student associations are no longer required to fund supporters of both sides equally when money from association levies are used.</p>
<p>This is, however, something that AUSA is committed to doing. &quot;The AUSA executive believes that students will benefit most from an equally funded campaign, we feel that it is the executive&#39;s job to inform the students and not to push a one sided arguement as happen last year.&quot; said AUSA President Kane Stanford</p>
<p>&quot;Obvioulsy AUSA executive members, including myself, have a preference for one side or the other but I feel uncomfortable using my position to influence the outcome of a vote of this magnitute.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; AUSA executive has decided to fund both sides equally this year and I think that students will be better informed as a result. The executive also has measures in place to curtail the misleading material that was published last year&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All going well, we will have a good campaign and students will send a clear message to the executive about they want their students association to be funded&quot;</p>
