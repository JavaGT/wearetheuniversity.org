<p>Richard Prebble Media Release -- Other</p>
<p>The ACT caucus is holding its caucus retreat to plan an all-out attack on ACC nationalisation, says ACT Leader Richard Prebble.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike National, ACT has no intention of waiting for the Budget before putting the Labour/Alliance Government under tough scrutiny.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT does not need to take time off to decide what we stand for . ACT is the party that openly supports free enterprise, choice and individual responsibility.</p>
<p>&quot;Nationalising ACC without compensation is ideological socialism.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has no mandate for this act of communism. Even the Alliance thinks the policy is extreme. The Greens did not campaign for it.</p>
<p>&quot;Thousands of small businesses have saved thousands because ACC was opened to the benefits of free enterprise competition. Benefits for workers are better.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT intends using its excellent business networks to mobilise public opinion.</p>
<p>&quot;Calling for submissions over summer meant many firms have not yet been able to make a submission. ACT believes many people, firms and organisations want to make submissions and we are calling on the committee to extend the submission period until the end of February.</p>
<p>Attached: letter to ACC committee</p>

<p>Mr Graham Kelly MP Chairman, Committee on ACC Insurance Transitional Provisions Bill Parliament Buildings</p>
<p>Dear Mr Kelly</p>
<p>Re early close-off date for submissions on ACC Bill</p>
<p>Advertisement - scroll to continue reading</p>
<p>In the last seven days the ACT office has been receiving many enquiries about the ACC nationalisation Bill. Individuals, firms and organisations are advising that they were not aware that the Government had included this Bill with the urgency motion in the pre-Christmas rush.</p>
<p>Of course, over Christmas most firms close. For organisations preparing a submission to a select committee over Christmas is a very difficult task. Most need to get a mandate from their members, an impossibility in January.</p>
<p>It is fundamentally anti-democratic to call submissions in December with a cut-off date in January and I formally request that the date be extended to the end of February. This will allow voluntary organisations - many of which have seen their ACC premiums halved - to make submissions.</p>
<p>The committee could also seek submissions from individuals who have suffered an accident, to compare how they have been treated by insurance companies with the arrogance and indifference of the old monopoly ACC.</p>
<p>The committee is not doing the job that Parliament gave it if it does not give the public a real opportunity to make a submission.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>Hon Richard Prebble<br>CBE LEADER, ACT NEW ZEALAND</p>
<p>ENDS  </p>
