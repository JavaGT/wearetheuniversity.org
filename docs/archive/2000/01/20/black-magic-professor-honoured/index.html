<p><strong>Thursday, 20 January 2000, 4:37 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Victoria University Associate Professor, Dr Dai Gilbertson, has been admitted to a Fellowship of the Australia-New Zealand Academy of Management for his ‘outstanding research, teaching and contribution to management studies in Australasia and to the academy as its first New Zealand President&quot;.</p>
<p>He is only the second New Zealander to be admitted and joins a group of seven Australians in the Fellowship class.</p>
<p>Dr Gilbertson in known for his work in strategy and innovation both in business and sport. ‘My core task is to develop thinking managers for tomorrows organisations’ he says. ‘This means understanding the nature of competitive advantage and how one sustains it’.</p>
<p>The ‘Black Magic’ research undertaken by Dr Gilbertson and his graduate students is based on innovative organisations such as MACPAC, Interlock, Canterbury of New Zealand, Ngai Tahu and others.</p>
<p>‘The innovators are our economic heroes’ he says. ‘After a decade of research I think we know the keys to building new ventures so that they make it as successful international companies’.</p>
<p>‘Sport has been central to our national identity – of understanding our values and who we are’ he says. ‘Our work with the captains of sport and industry (supported by the Hillary Commission and the Sports Foundation) demonstrates that there are eight vital components to building international success but of these coaching and innovation are the two crucial areas to harness and develop raw talent’.</p>
<p>He has been described as ‘an outstanding kiwi who has helped many sports in ways that are largely unacknowledged’ says the Chief Executive of Soccer, Bob Patterson. ‘Dr Gilbertson has really been the charismatic driving force behind many of the significant changes in kiwi sport’.</p>

<p>Dr Gilbertson was ‘a hidden hand’ behind major changes in the governance and organisation of the Olympic Movement in New Zealand and is a trustee of the Olympic Academy.</p>
<p>He believes in creating a challenging environment that integrates his New Zealand applied research with his teaching. &quot;I remain deeply concerned with the need to provide world class management education and coaching to build and maintain our ability to excel in international competition – Black Magic if you like’, he says.</p>
<p>Dr Gilbertson has had a varied career including; Fulbright Scholar, Infantry Officer, JP, consultant to the US Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC and to many business and government organisations.  </p>
