<p>MEDIA RELEASE<br>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>8 January 2000</p>
<p>Where Are Young Labour?</p>
<p>‘Where are Young Labour?’ was the key question discussed by Young Nationals Chair Daniel Gordon in talks with the Australian Young Liberal members on the Gold Coast today.</p>
<p>Daniel Gordon and Brett Hogan, Federal President of the Young Liberal Movement of Australia, held discussions about the future of youth political organisations in the two countries.</p>
<p>Both were in agreement as to the lack of an effective opposition to both movements. There was an acknowledgement from both that a youth section in Labour did exist in some form – but had a lack of following and enthusiasm by young people.</p>
<p>“Certainly in New Zealand there can be no doubt that Young Labour were little more than an election bribe. Given that Labour voters are overwhelmingly in the over-60s age group, Labour knew that it had to offer something to younger voters. And so we saw the emergence of ‘Young Labour’ and the odd press release telling the world why Young Nationals are so bad,” said Daniel Gordon.</p>
<p>“Now that Labour are in office, where are Young Labour? We have not had a single press release from Young Labour since the election.</p>
<p>“Young Nationals on the other hand have been active, as we have been in our long history as New Zealands largest and most successful youth political organisation.</p>
<p>“And we do intend to challenge our opponents to tell young people what benefit there is to young people by encouraging them to borrow even more on their student loans by removing interest, and by penalising our best and brightest by raising taxes to high income earners.</p>

<p>“I challenge the leadership of Young Labour, in particular Moana Mackey and Jordan Carter, to be bold and tell us they are awake. Give young people in New Zealand hope that the new left wing minority government isn’t just a political flash-in-the-pan,” concluded Daniel Gordon.</p>
