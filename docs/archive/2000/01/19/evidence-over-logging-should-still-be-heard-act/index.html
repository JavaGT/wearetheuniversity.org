<p>Evidence Over Logging Should Still Be Heard - ACT</p>
<p>Wednesday 19th Jan 2000<br>Gerry Eckhoff<br>Media Release -- Environment</p>
<p>Minister of Science, Pete Hodgson turned his back on the scientific evidence in favour of his personal &quot;judgement&quot; when he stopped the West Coast Beech logging scheme according to ACT Conservation Spokesman Gerry Eckhoff who says the Government still has a duty to provide a forum for scientific evidence to be heard on the scheme and any future logging proposal.</p>
<p>Gerry Eckhoff today said that the Minister is not critical of the science that supports the sustainability of selective logging of West Coast beech forest but that the Timberlands decision was a &#39;value judgement&#39; &quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;How can the Minister remain in charge of Science and Technology and ignore the growing consensus among scientists that the scheme is not only sustainable but would help ensure the health of the forest habitat into the future.</p>
<p>&quot;I call on the Minister to open a transparent and public scientific inquiry into the issues so that, to use Pete Hodgson&#39;s words, &#39;tacky politics&#39; can be put aside and the real story can come out. The scientific community should have the opportunity to put the case that was closed down when the Government shut down the resource consent hearing.</p>
<p>&quot;I am certain the Royal Society and the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment and academic experts will welcome the opportunity to present their research results.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot afford to put the forest at risk for short term political face saving,&quot; said Gerry Eckhoff.</p>
