<p><strong>Thursday, 12 October 2000, 4:39 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Confirmation That Import Ban Would Be Bad News For Libraries</p>
<p>Officials from the National Library have confirmed the concerns expressed earlier this week by National MP Katherine Rich about the likely impact of a ban on parallel importing.</p>
<p>The Government is expected to announce, within the next few weeks, a ban on the parallel importation of creative goods including books and CDs.</p>
<p>National Library officials today confirmed to the Education and Science Select Committee that such a ban would increase the price of books, reduce the quantity able to be purchased within limited budgets and create delays in sourcing books which are produced offshore.</p>
<p>&quot;The officials made it clear that community and academic libraries would suffer as a result of such a move,&quot; Ms Rich, National&#39;s spokesperson on the National Library and Archives said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The Otago University Library, Dunedin Public Library and LIANZA (Library Association of New Zealand) have expressed similar concerns about the effects of an importing ban. The simple fact is it will increase the cost of books, making it harder for local libraries to serve their communities.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government talks about the importance of a skills-based knowledge economy, and here they are about to introduce a move which will cut back on a vital source of knowledge,&quot; Katherine Rich said.</p>
