<p><strong>Friday, 20 October 2000, 11:11 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association">Victoria University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Students up and down the country have welcomed news that their peers at Waikato University have voted to return to compulsory membership of their students&#39; association. Waikato was the first students&#39; association to adopt a voluntary membership regime in 1998, and since then has faced huge financial difficulties and has lost its representation on University boards and committees.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision by Waikato students to return to compulsory membership clearly marks the end of the failed voluntary membership experiment. Waikato Students Union was heralded by voluntary campaigners as the way of the future, this result proves them wrong,&quot; Chris Hipkins, President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students&#39; Association said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the Waikato Students&#39; Union (WSU) became voluntary three years ago, they have lost all of their national representation through their withdrawal from NZUSA, they missed the opportunity to participate in the 1999 NZU Games, and in 2000 when the University bailed them out they came last,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Waikato student newspaper Nexus almost collapsed a number of times, and the social events on campus went downhill dramatically. Obviously students realised they had made a mistake and voted accordingly,&quot; Mr. Hipkins said.</p>
<p>&quot;We sincerely hope that now that compulsory membership has been restored, Waikato students will again get the representation and services they deserve from their students&#39; association. We look forward to again working constructively with the Waikato Students&#39; Union through NZUSA to serve the interests of all students throughout New Zealand,&quot; Chris Hipkins said.</p>
