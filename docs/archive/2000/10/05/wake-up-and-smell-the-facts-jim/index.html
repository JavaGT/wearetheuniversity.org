<p><strong>Thursday, 5 October 2000, 9:57 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Today&#39;s ad in the New Zealand Herald from ex-pat young New Zealanders is a wake up call to the Government from a generation lost, National Youth Affairs spokesperson Simon Power said today.</p>
<p>Hundreds of ex-pat young people have put their names and dollars to an advertisement expressing concern about New Zealand&#39;s current economic direction. They say the current environment discourages investment, hard work and job creation.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s about time the Government took a reality check. Our young people are not going to come flooding back home under this Government - they are leaving in droves. This ad reads like a memorial of lost New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;I am the only one out of ten of my university friends left in New Zealand. They refer to our &#39;pacific peso&#39;, high tax rates and industrial relations as reasons they don&#39;t want to return. They have no confidence in the Labour-Alliance Government.</p>
<p>&quot;Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton and his friends need to realise that young people don&#39;t see any relevance in unions, they want to work hard, establish a good career and earn good money.</p>
<p>&quot;Without exception, the people I talk to still call New Zealand home and want to come back to start a family one-day, but they are not prepared to return in the current environment.</p>
<p>&quot;Young people are the future of New Zealand and we must give them a good reason to either stay here or return home once they have done their OE.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Anderton is just dreaming if he thinks young ex-pats are going to return to New Zealand while he and Labour are in Government and refusing to listen to their concerns,&quot; Simon Power said.</p>
