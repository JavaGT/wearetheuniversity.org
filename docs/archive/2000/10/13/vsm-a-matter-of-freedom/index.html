<p><strong>Friday, 13 October 2000, 9:58 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels">Prebble&#39;s Rebels</a></strong></p>
<p>Charles Ashton, Waikato University President of Prebble’s Rebels, has questioned the commitment of students associations to social causes, good government and student welfare by campaigning in favour of compulsory union membership and free education.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue at stake with voluntary membership is freedom of choice. In our society, it is appalling that anyone should contemplate forcing a class of people to join an organization purely because choose to further their education&quot;, Mr Ashton said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past, students were forced to join student unions whether or not they used the services provided, services which usually consist of nothing more than protesting against government policies of the day.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ashton went on to say, &quot;I find it amazing that any student union has the gall to use the ‘free rider’ argument when that is what student unions want to achieve themselves with their persistent, unrealistic, demands for free education.</p>
<p>&quot;They know that someone has to pay for their education but, they would rather burden the tax payer with the entire cost. This is hypocrisy of the worst kind and would divert taxpayer money away from where it is needed, for example law enforcement or health.</p>
<p>&quot;How many more criminals would they want still roaming the streets, how many more of our elderly would they want to see waiting for hip operations, just so they can have their tertiary education at no cost to themselves?&quot;</p>
