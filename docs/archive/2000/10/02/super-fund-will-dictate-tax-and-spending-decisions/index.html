<p>Super Fund Will Dictate Tax And Spending Decisions For Generations</p>
<p>If the Government adopts Michael Cullen&#39;s superannuation prefunding scheme, no government will be able to make significant changes to tax or spending levels for the next 30 years, National Finance spokesperson Bill English said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Cullen is about to put his Government in a straitjacket, and I suspect his colleagues don&#39;t know it. The Cabinet - and Labour and Alliance backbenchers - need to understand that Dr Cullen&#39;s scheme means there will be no money left over for the promises Labour is already lining up for the next election.</p>
<p>&quot;There won&#39;t be anything like enough money for significant changes to the student loans scheme or pay parity for kindergarten teachers or abolishing asset testing for people in long-term care - which Labour has promised.</p>
<p>&quot;Nor will there be enough money for other measures Labour is hinting at, such as increasing benefit levels or rates rebates for superannuitants.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, even shorter-term spending like the pay rise for the armed forces which the Prime Minister is promising will have to be reconsidered.</p>
<p>&quot;It also means there will be no room for tax incentives or lower taxes. For instance, it would be almost impossible to drop the company tax rate to match Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;National has always said the public needs a better understanding of this policy because it is a huge commitment of taxpayers&#39; dollars for coming generations.</p>
<p>&quot;People certainly don&#39;t understand what the real choices are. Dr Cullen ought to make sure that at least his caucus does understand the consequences.</p>

<p>&quot;The prefunding scheme will only give certainty about superannuation if governments run surpluses of about $3 billion every year for the next 30 years. This Government itself won&#39;t even achieve that.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the single most important decision on what New Zealand governments will do for a generation. Let&#39;s do it on the basis of proper discussion, not back-room deals between a couple of parties,&quot; Mr English said.</p>
