<p><strong>Monday, 9 October 2000, 1:06 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The sentence of preventive detention, with a minimum non parole period of 18 years, for the killer of Auckland journalist Kylie Jones is &quot;appropriate and fitting&quot;, National&#39;s Justice spokesperson Tony Ryall said today.</p>
<p>Justice Paterson handed down the sentence in the Auckland High Court today, saying he doubts killer and rapist Taffy Hotene will ever be let out of jail in light of his history of violent and sexual offending.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a despicable and unprovoked attack by a repeat offender who had been released from prison just two months before the attack,&quot; Tony Ryall said.</p>
<p>&quot;In last years referendum New Zealanders sent a clear message that they want judges to deal severely with violent offenders. The will of the people has been listened to in this case.</p>
<p>&quot;I join with the thousands of New Zealanders who will commend today&#39;s sentence. There is no place for offenders such as this in our society,&quot; Tony Ryall said.</p>
