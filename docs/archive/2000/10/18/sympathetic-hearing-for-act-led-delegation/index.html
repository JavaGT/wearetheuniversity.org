<p><strong>Wednesday, 18 October 2000, 9:31 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>The Foxton couple who lost their pig farm two years ago because of a resource consent decision by the Manawatu Regional Council, received a “sympathetic” hearing from the council today, ACT MP Owen Jennings said.</p>
<p>Mr Jennings led a delegation to the council today demanding compensation for Mr and Mrs John Bierstaker, because their business went under after the council upheld complaints from neighbours.</p>
<p>Mr Jennings claimed the council’s action was a “complete abuse of power” under the Resource Management Act.</p>
<p>“The council made a deliberate decision to put the Bierstakers out of business, knowing full well it could completely ruin them,” Mr Jennings said.</p>
<p>Addressing the council meeting today, and presenting a thousand-name petition in support of the Bierstakers, Mr Jennings said Parliament never anticipated that the resource consents procedures under the RMA, would deprive anybody of their means of livelihood.</p>
<p>“That is exactly what the Manawatu Regional council did when the Bierstakers sought the right to carry on their long-standing pig farming business,” Mr Jennings said.</p>
<p>He said he was pleased the council gave the couple a “sympathetic” hearing today but it still had to address the compensation issue.</p>
<p>“Although there is no legal obligation for the Council to pay compensation, consideration is urgently needed to restore equity and dignity to the Bierstakers,” Mr Jennings said.</p>
<p>“The outcome will depend on the councillors’ determination to do what is right, given the poor manner in which the whole process has been handled.</p>
<p>“This case highlights yet again that the Resource Management Act was in need of a complete review, so private property rights are protected under the law,” Mr Jennings said.</p>
