<p><strong>Tuesday, 3 October 2000, 8:26 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Max Bradford National Industrial Relations Spokesperson</p>
<p>Tuesday 3 October 2000</p>
<p>Labour Minister offends employers again</p>
<p>The Labour Minister has dropped herself in it with employers - once again,&quot; National&#39;s Industrial Relations spokesperson Max Bradford said today.</p>
<p>&quot;This time it&#39;s over her proud defence of her and Government Ministers partying it up with the Council of Trade Unions to celebrate the implementation of the Employment Relations Act.</p>
<p>&quot;Employers are surprised the Government hosted a union-only party at Parliament last night to celebrate the ERA.</p>
<p>&quot;Margaret Wilson has added insult to injury in Parliament today by stating the function was for those who supported the legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;And she made it even worse by admitting her Ministers and the Prime Minister led a rendition of the union anthem &quot;Solidarity Forever&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;She even offered to get the Labour-Alliance team to sing it again in Parliament today.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister of Labour has again thumbed her nose at business.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government has talked long and hard about a so-called charm offensive to business to try to get them to have some confidence in this Government&#39;s policies.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately Margaret Wilson&#39;s actions are big on offending and short on the charm.&quot;</p>
<p>Ends</p>
<p>Solidarity Forever</p>
<p>When the union&#39;s inspiration through the workers&#39; blood shall run,<br>There can be no power greater anywhere beneath the sun;<br>Yet what force on earth is weaker than the feeble strength of one,<br>But the union makes us strong.<br>CHORUS:<br>Solidarity forever,<br>Solidarity forever,<br>Solidarity forever,<br>For the union makes us strong.<br>Is there aught we hold in common with the greedy parasite,<br>Who would lash us into serfdom and would crush us with his might?<br>Is there anything left to us but to organize and fight?<br>For the union makes us strong.</p>

<p>It is we who plowed the praries; built the cities where they trade;<br>Dug the mines and built the workshops, endless miles of railroad<br>laid;<br>Now we stand outcast and starving midst the wonders we have made;<br>But the union makes us strong.</p>
<p>All the world that&#39;s owned by idle drones is ours and ours alone.<br>We have laid the wide foundations; built it skyward stone by stone.<br>It is ours, not to slave in, but to master and to own.<br>While the union makes us strong.</p>
<p>They have taken untold millions that they never toiled to earn,<br>But without our brain and muscle not a single wheel can turn.<br>We can break their haughty power, gain our freedom when we learn<br>That the union makes us strong.</p>
<p>In our hands is placed a power greater than their hoarded gold,<br>Greater than the might of armies, magnified a thousand-fold.<br>We can bring to birth a new world from the ashes of the old<br>For the union makes us strong.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
