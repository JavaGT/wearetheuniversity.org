<p>Government must reinstate appeal rights for overstayers</p>
<p>Yesterday&#39;s deportation of a Filipino family was an ominous precedent for thousands of overstayer families who do not qualify for the government&#39;s recently announced amnesty, Green MP Keith Locke said today.</p>
<p>&quot;To avoid further human tragedy, the government should order a halt to instant deportations and reinstate appeal rights lost by many overstayers on October 1,&quot; said Mr Locke, the party&#39;s immigration spokesperson.</p>
<p>&quot;The Mila family may have been subject to an administrative slip up in that they did have an appeal in the system,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But I&#39;m worried about 15,000 other overstayers, on government figures, who have lost their appeal rights and could get the same treatment. They&#39;ll be kicked out of a country they now consider home.</p>
<p>&quot;Suddenly one day they won&#39;t be turning up to work and their kids won&#39;t be at school. There&#39;s no chance to explain their disappearance, pick up a reference from their boss, say goodbye to friends and relatives,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are good reasons why some overstayers haven&#39;t appealed for the right to stay here. They have no access to legal aid, the appeal process is expensive, and there has been a great deal of confusion about the new immigration provisions, the criteria by which their cases will be judged and the options that are open to them.</p>
<p>&quot;There are also language barriers when dealing with Immigration Service staff, and not surprisingly there is a lot of fear about approaching authorities without being clear themselves what the likely outcome of that will be,&quot; said Mr Locke.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s no justification for a &#39;get tough&#39; policy. We are not overburdened by migrants. In fact, New Zealand has a net annual outflow of over 10,000 people.</p>
<p>&quot;The last thing New Zealand needs is a return to the notorious &#39;dawn raids&#39;, with all the anguish that went with them,&quot; said Mr Locke.</p>
