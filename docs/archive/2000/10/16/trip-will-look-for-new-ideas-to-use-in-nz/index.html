<p><strong>Monday, 16 October 2000, 2:42 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Opposition Leader Jenny Shipley will be overseas for the next fortnight looking at practical approaches to business and education to help get New Zealand moving and get New Zealanders believing in their country and their future.</p>
<p>Mrs Shipley will leave New Zealand on Wednesday to visit Singapore, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;In all these countries I will be talking to people who are doing the sorts of things that businesses and families in New Zealand are crying out for.</p>
<p>&quot;In Singapore I&#39;ll be looking at schools and meeting the Communications and IT Minister Yeo Cheow Tong and speaking to experts about how they&#39;ve achieved cutting edge approaches to learning with modern information technology. I&#39;ll be talking to the National Science and Technology Board about research and development assistance and I will be discussing the joint venture approach to new developments and projects.</p>
<p>&quot;In Ireland I will be looking at how one of the most moribund economies in Europe was turned around through tax and research and development incentives.</p>
<p>&quot;Not everything the Irish do will be applicable to New Zealand, but I know there are lessons we can learn. I&#39;m interested in how to manage the margin between corporate and personal tax rates. I&#39;m also interested in the approach to tertiary education and the development of new industries.</p>
<p>&quot;I will also be meeting Deputy Prime Minister Mary Harney who is a strong advocate of the Irish approach.</p>
<p>&quot;In the United States I will be talking to Government and non-government people, including advisers on R &amp; D and education. The most successful and powerful economy in the world must many things we can pick up here.</p>
<p>&quot;I will be meeting US Trade Representative Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky and Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Pacific Stanley Roth to discuss matters of mutual interest</p>
<p>&quot;In the United States and the United Kingdom I also expect to talk to officials from the Republican and Conservative parties about strategies for the centre-right.</p>
<p>&quot;This will be a fascinating trip. I&#39;ll gather a lot of fresh ideas to apply in New Zealand,&quot; Mrs Shipley said.</p>
