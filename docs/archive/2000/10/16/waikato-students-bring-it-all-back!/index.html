<p><strong>Monday, 16 October 2000, 10:30 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>&quot;Waikato students are on the verge of bringing back a functioning student association, with a vote this week to restore compulsory membership to their student union&quot; said Sam Huggard, Co President of the New Zealand University Students Association, from Hamilton.</p>
<p>The NZUSA Co Presidents are in Hamilton this week assisting the Waikato Students&#39; Union with their campaign for compulsory membership, and are hopeful that students will return a vote for compulsory membership.</p>
<p>&quot;WSU was held up as an example of how voluntary membership of students associations would lead to increased efficiency, accountability and better service provision for students. However the experience at Waikato has proved all of these assertions wrong,&quot; said Sam Huggard.</p>
<p>&quot;Voluntary membership simply has not worked at Waikato. The Union&#39;s ability to support students has been massively undermined. They have lost representation on key university committees, including council, they can only provide a few services, are not represented nationally. WSU is also unable to provide independent advocacy for their students, with the University now running that service&quot;, said Huggard.</p>
<p>&quot;This is last chance for Waikato University students to have a student union. Under the new Education Amendment Act, votes on the membership status of student associations are only able to be conducted by institution councils a maximum of every two years. If students don&#39;t vote in favour of compulsory student membership this week, the WSU may not be able to last that long.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Student leaders at Waikato are confident that the students will return a compulsory vote in this weeks referendum. We are supporting their campaign to bring back a student union that is capable of delivering effective advocacy, services and representation for Waikato students,&quot; said Sam Huggard.</p>
