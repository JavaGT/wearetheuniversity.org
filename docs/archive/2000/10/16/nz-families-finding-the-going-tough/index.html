<p>Rt Hon Jenny Shipley</p>
<p>Leader of the Opposition</p>
<p>Monday 16 October 2000</p>
<p>NZ families finding the going tough</p>
<p>The worst CPI quarterly rise in a decade confirms what families have been saying to me for weeks, Opposition Leader Jenny Shipley said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Out on the road last week, in places such as Huntly, Pukekohe, Hamilton, Nelson and Canterbury, New Zealanders constantly told me it&#39;s getting harder and harder to manage the household budget.</p>
<p>&quot;The high cost of imports caused by the low Kiwi dollar and the constant creep in petrol prices that we&#39;ve witnessed over the last few weeks is having its toll.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflation as measured by the CPI is running at 3 percent - right at the top edge of the Reserve Bank&#39;s level of toleration.</p>
<p>&quot;Under National, New Zealanders had a decade in which they could at least rely on prices staying stable.</p>
<p>&quot;That confidence is over for the foreseeable future. In less than a year under Labour things have changed considerably and families are feeling the effects of the damage that&#39;s been done to the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;My worry is that New Zealanders haven&#39;t seen the worst of it yet. A lot of the tough stuff caused by the low dollar and high petrol prices is still to come through in the official measurements.</p>
<p>&quot;On behalf of New Zealanders, my plea to the Government is to listen to what New Zealanders are saying.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government should at least show it knows the extent of the problem. It must show that it is willing to respond by bringing together a package of measures that will restore confidence among consumers and businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;To date the Government&#39;s refusal to do so has simply compounded problems. It must act urgently to get New Zealand back on the road to prosperity,&quot; Mrs Shipley said.</p>
