<p><strong>Wednesday, 1 November 2000, 1:11 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>&quot;The reaction from Labour MPs to the Ruth Dyson drunk-driving incident has been disappointing,&quot; National&#39;s ACC spokesman Gerry Brownlee said today.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the Prime Minister and her colleagues must stand up and be accountable for their &#39;spin&#39;, which sends horribly mixed messages about the carnage caused by drunk driving.</p>
<p>&quot;To all those who have portrayed Ruth Dyson as the victim in this incident - would they make the same excuses on behalf of the drivers who left 122 people dead, and nearly 2,000 people injured in alcohol related crashes last year?</p>
<p>&quot;To all those who have praised Ms Dyson for &#39;doing the right thing&#39; - did she have any alternative, as Associate Minister of ACC, when the social costs of drinking related accidents last year were $590 million? And isn&#39;t it likely Ms Dyson&#39;s decision was made easy by the Prime Minister&#39;s assurances that she would get reinstated once this had all blown over?</p>
<p>&quot;To those who defend Ms Dyson by saying 98 percent of people will think &#39;There but for the Grace of God go I&#39; - is this message designed to endorse drunk-driving? Does this comment mean that 98 percent people have access to a free 24-hour a day chauffeur service? And doesn&#39;t this statement undermine the millions of dollars spent on campaigns to change public attitudes on the acceptability of drunk-driving?</p>
<p>&quot;To those who suggest Ms Dyson had just three glasses of wine - is this designed to suggest that Ms Dyson was just a bit &#39;unlucky&#39;, and doesn&#39;t it ignore the expert opinion that her breath-alcohol reading would require her drinking a 750ml bottle of wine within the hour before being tested? Ms Dyson had been drinking over a period of four hours, exactly how much did she consume?</p>

<p>&quot;To the Prime Minister, who has clearly indicated Ms Dyson is likely to get a Ministerial job back, will she apply the same rule to everyone who loses their job over a drunk-driving offence? Will they be given the Ruth Dyson option of falling on a rubber sword?</p>
<p>&quot;Those who defend Ms Dyson should think long and hard about the consequences of excusing drunk-driving as if it were a minor transgression. Ms Dyson only lost her job. Thousands have lost their lives,&quot; Mr Brownlee said.</p>
