<p><strong>Wednesday, 1 November 2000, 4:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Government spent at least $140,000 on the Doone report on Maori crime to tell us what we already know, National&#39;s Justice spokesman Tony Ryall said today.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government has promised a lot with its closing the gaps policy. Yet the best it can do to address Maori crime is to pay at least $140,000 for a 70 page report that doesn&#39;t tell us anything new and put less than $6 million a year into programmes that are already running.</p>
<p>&quot;This report is no more than an expensive way to deal with a personnel problem. The Prime Minister created a job for Peter Doone to try to disguise what was in effect a golden handshake</p>
<p>&quot;The over-representation of Maori in crime statistics is not new. National started to address the problem by funding early intervention programmes and promoting the integration of social services. We put a lot of work into programmes like Family Start, Strengthening Families, Social Workers in Schools and developing alternative learning centres for students with behavioural problems.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government also has to realise that these sensible early intervention programmes are good for non-Maori too.</p>
<p>&quot;The best Mr Doone could do is tell the Government to keep doing what National started. We could have given the Government that advice for free,&quot; Mr Ryall said.</p>
