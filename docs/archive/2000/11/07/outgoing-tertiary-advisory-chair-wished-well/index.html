<p>Media Statement<br>For Immediate Release<br>7/11/2000</p>
<p>OUTGOING TERTIARY ADVISORY CHAIR WISHED WELL BY STUDENTS</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) are very sad to hear that, Dr Norman Kingsbury, Chair of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission (TEAC) has resigned today.</p>
<p>”Dr Kingsbury has fulfilled his role as chair with integrity and vision,” said Tanja Schutz, Co President NZUSA ”Subsequently he has the respect of the tertiary sector”.</p>
<p>“ Under Dr Kingsbury’s guidance, the commission was established to provide advice to the Government on future directions for the tertiary sector “ said Tanja Schutz “TEAC still has much work to do, but Dr Kingsbury has left it in good stead.”</p>
<p>“TEAC has had the unenviable job of advising the Government on what to do with a sector that was left in a shambles by the previous National government” said Tanja Schutz. “Recent comments made by the opposition tertiary education spokesperson are therefore ironic and somewhat unhelpful.”</p>
<p>NZUSA wish Dr Kingsbury all the best in his future endeavors and look forward to continue working with TEAC in the coming year.</p>
