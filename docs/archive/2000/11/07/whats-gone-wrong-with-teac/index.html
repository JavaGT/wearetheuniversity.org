<p>Maurice Williamson National Tertiary Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>7 November 2000</p>
<p>What&#39;s gone wrong with TEAC?</p>
<p>The sudden, immediate resignation of Tertiary Education Advisory Commission Chair Norman Kingsbury raises more questions than Steve Maharey&#39;s statement answers, National&#39;s Tertiary Education spokesperson Maurice Williamson said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Kingsbury was only appointed in April. How can things be in &#39;good order&#39; after a term of about eight months? How exactly is Dr Kingsbury&#39;s resignation timely? If he was not intending to stick with the job for very long why was he appointed in the first place? What were the terms of his departure?</p>
<p>&quot;Little progress has been evident since the Commission was established in April. Is Dr Kingsbury&#39;s resignation symptomatic of a resourcing issue? Did the Associate Minister ever have any intention of TEAC being an effective body or did he just not like the advice he was given?</p>
<p>&quot;Was there agreement amongst members about the direction the Commission wanted to take or were there irreconcilable differences in views?</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey needs to front up and tell New Zealanders what&#39;s gone wrong with TEAC.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully whatever was behind the resignation of Dr Kingsbury after only eight months in the job will be addressed by Mr Maharey before a new Chair is appointed,&quot; Mr Williamson said.</p>
