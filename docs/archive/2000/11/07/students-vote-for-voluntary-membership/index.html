<p>Media release</p>
<p>STUDENTS VOTE FOR VOLUNTARY MEMBERSHIP</p>
<p>University of Auckland students have voted to maintain voluntary membership of the Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA).</p>
<p>Fifty nine percent of students who returned postal ballot papers voted in favour of retaining voluntary membership.</p>
<p>Returning Officer, Warwick Nicoll says 5545 students voted in favour of voluntary membership, while 3814 voted to return to compulsory membership. There were 30 informal votes.</p>
<p>More than twenty seven thousand enrolled students were eligible to vote in the referendum. Some 34% of these (9389 students) returned postal ballot papers.</p>
<p>Membership of AUSA was compulsory until a student-initiated referendum in April 1999 determined by a narrow margin of just 108 votes that AUSA membership should be voluntary from 1 May 1999.</p>
<p>Subsequently the University has entered into new arrangements to provide some services to students which had previously been funded from the AUSA membership fee.</p>
<p>AUSA has continued to function as a students’ association under the voluntary membership provisions.</p>
