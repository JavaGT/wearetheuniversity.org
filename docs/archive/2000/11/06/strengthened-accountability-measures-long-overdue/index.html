<p><strong>Monday, 6 November 2000, 4:10 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association">Victoria University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Recent announcements that the Government intends to strengthen legislative provisions regarding the governance of tertiary institutions are a welcome step in the right direction and have been long overdue, according to Victoria University of Wellington Students&#39; Association President Chris Hipkins.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the past few years University Councils have been left completely to their own devices and been allowed to do whatever they please with student and tax-payer funded resources. Any moves by Government to do something about this should be welcomed,&quot; Mr. Hipkins said.</p>
<p>&quot;The past National Government took a totally hands-off approach to the tertiary sector, leading to the progressive commercialisation of our polytechnics and universities. The Labour/Alliance Government&#39;s change of approach has been incredibly refreshing,&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Hipkins urged the Victoria University Council to take note of the changes. &quot;The days when University Councils were encouraged to act like businesses and return substantial surpluses are over and I urge Victoria University to reconsider its desire to slash costs in order to make a surplus in future years,&quot; Mr. Hipkins said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has signalled a change in direction for the sector, however I&#39;m not sure that has yet been embraced by all institutions and that&#39;s why it&#39;s important to have strengthened accountability measures,&quot; Mr. Hipkins said.</p>
<p>&quot;In particular, I would urge Victoria University to take note of the Government&#39;s desire for institutions to act with a long-term view when considering resource-allocation decisions. A quick-fix slash and burn to resolve an immediate financial problem is not an acceptable solution,&quot; Mr. Hipkins said.</p>
