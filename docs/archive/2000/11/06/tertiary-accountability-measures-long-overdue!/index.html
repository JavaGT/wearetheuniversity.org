<p><strong>Monday, 6 November 2000, 1:28 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>&quot;The accountability measures that the government has announced today is positive step in the dismantling of the market model of tertiary education,&quot; said Sam Huggard, Co President of the New Zealand University Students Association.</p>
<p>Mr. Huggard was responding to a speech today from Tertiary Minister Steve Maharey outlining legislation to be introduced this year to increase the accountability requirements of public tertiary institution councils and CEOs.</p>
<p>&quot;The public and students are the principal funders of the country&#39;s tertiary institutions and have the right to expect that these institutions are being responsive to the needs of the communities they serve, and the overall tertiary system that they are part of,&quot; said Sam Huggard.</p>
<p>&quot;We are supportive of the Labour-Alliance government&#39;s commitment to achieving a more strategic tertiary sector that places the needs of learners first, and see today&#39;s announcement, and the ongoing work of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission, as going a considerable way to achieving this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The previous National government&#39;s hands-off approach to tertiary sector management led to the festering of a highly competitive, market driven environment, which saw in many cases institutions being run more like businesses than sites for excellence in teaching and research.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are also pleased with the recognition by the Tertiary Minister that to achieve a collaborative and co-operative sector, appropriate funding will need to follow. We look forward to these issues being addressed in coming government budgets,&quot; said Sam Huggard.</p>
