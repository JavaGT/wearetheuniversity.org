<p><strong>Wednesday, 22 November 2000, 10:11 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National Economic Development spokesperson Max Bradford today released statistics obtained through parliamentary questions showing that 126 Bright Future scholarships were granted in the 1999/2000 year.</p>
<p>The scholarship scheme was introduced by the National Government in 1999, as part of the Bright Future initiative to prepare New Zealand to become a knowledge based economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bright Future policy is clearly working well. The scheme has supported some of our top students in endeavours such as completing a PhD, undertaking postgraduate research and study and training in technologies pertinent to enterprises.</p>
<p>&quot;The people supported by these scholarships are exactly the type of people we must be nurturing so they will stay in New Zealand and help build our businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;Two thirds of the scholarship recipients are in the science and technology field - an area that is crying out for a major injection of skills. One third of the recipients are in the social sciences and commerce fields. This is a reasonable balance.</p>
<p>&quot;I am concerned for the future of our businesses, particularly those in the technology field, when I hear the Minister talking about his plans to review the Bright Future scholarships scheme. The Minister&#39;s comments indicate that the number of Bright Future scholarships may be reduced.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government is intent on dumbing down our education system. We should be supporting our best and brightest students, not trying to ensure that all students are simply mediocre,&quot; Mr Bradford said.</p>
