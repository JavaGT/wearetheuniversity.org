<p>NCEA Introduction will Show Scant Regard for Students</p>
<p>Thursday 23rd Nov 2000 Donna Awatere Huata Media Release -- Education</p>
<p>ACT Education spokesperson Donna Awatere Huata MP said today that the Minister of Education will have no regard for the future of students if he implements the National Certificate of Educational Achievement.</p>
<p>“Research shows that NCEA test score will be more than twice as unreliable as current exams,” Mrs Huata said.</p>
<p>“Trevor Mallard has swept this information under the carpet. The very research that Mr Mallard calls an ‘arid argument’ proves that the NCEA is inaccurate and unreliable.</p>
<p>“Research by Mr Cedric Hall shows there is transparency and reliability in education when students are allocated percentage marks in external exams.</p>
<p>“If a student scores 50 per cent in an external Maths exam, their actual skill ability lies between 40 – 60%. However, under the NCEA, if a student scores 50 per cent their actual ability could fall anywhere between 29 – 71%. Concerned Teachers spokesperson Peter Calvert highlighted the problem this week when he said Mr Mallard had been ‘conned’ into dropping percentiles and the use of ‘raw marks’ on reports for the NCEA.</p>
<p>“All of this is just not good enough. Employers need more accurate outcomes and students need to know exactly what their abilities are.</p>
<p>“This government has shown that its can talk about policy, but is not able to set benchmarks to see it through. If students are to compete in a modern knowledge-based economy we must raise the standards in education with accurate testing and assessment,&quot; Mrs Huata said.</p>
