<p><strong>Thursday, 23 November 2000, 4:14 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Police Minister George Hawkins confirmed in Parliament today that he thinks police recruits should pay for the privilege of being trained to be police, National&#39;s Police spokesperson Brian Neeson said today.</p>
<p>&quot;It is widely acknowledged that we need police recruits that are a bit older and have some life experience. Mr Hawkins&#39; policy will act as a disincentive for anyone with a family or a mortgage.</p>
<p>&quot;Only this week Mr Hawkins boasted about the increase in Maori and Pacific Island recruits. Yet his pay for training policy will surely have a negative affect on these groups.</p>
<p>&quot;The only recruits the police will be able to attract under Mr Hawkins&#39; regime will be wet-behind-the-ear school-leavers with no life experience. They&#39;re the only ones who will be willing to run up a &#39;student&#39; police debt.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Hawkins is continuing to deny that there is a cash crisis in the police. Rather than cutting corners in a crucial part of our police force he should start listening to the people on the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister&#39;s scrooge-like attitude will leave the police in a state where they are undeniably under-funded.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Hawkins was pro-police before the election now he&#39;s become Minister he is enacting anti-police policies,&quot; Mr Neeson said.</p>
