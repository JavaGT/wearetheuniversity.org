<p><strong>Thursday, 16 November 2000, 2:49 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>An Information Policy Summit aimed at trying to give government feedback on the needs of the information society, is being hosted by Victoria University later this month.</p>
<p>Organised by Victoria&#39;s School of Communications and Information Management the Summit aims to draw together and explore the many different opinions on information policy.</p>
<p>Professor Brian Corbitt says the objective is to put people in a room for 6-8 hours examine the issues and see what emerges and then present these finding to the government. &quot;We will not only be saying to government these are the issues, but also, telling them this is how these issues might be addressed.&quot;</p>
<p>The forum brings together many different sectors with an interest in information policy including business, libraries, professional groups such as ICANZ, consulting companies, the university sector and government.</p>
<p>Despite the presence of Commerce Minister Paul Swain, Professor Corbitt says the summit will not be political. &quot;We&#39;re trying to give feedback on what the information society needs and identify what issues need addressing - these issues apply regardless of who is in government.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Corbitt says there&#39;s no coherent information policy across New Zealand because of the many disparate views. &quot;It&#39;s part of our role as a university to contribute to society - we plan to act as a facilitator and form a partnership with government and society to make things happen.&quot;</p>
<p>The New Zealand government has embraced information as a key issue. As a university Victoria feels it can support government and enable the formation of more consensus about the role of information in the new economy, he says.</p>
<p>The Information Policy Summit will be held on Thursday, November 23, in the Moot Room in Victoria University&#39;s Law Faculty, Old Government Building, Wellington.  </p>
