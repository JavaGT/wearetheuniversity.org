<p>Tony Ryall National Housing Spokesman</p>
<p>30 November 2000</p>
<p>Not a sausage for 80% of low income families</p>
<p>&quot;The Housing Minister and Prime Minister will be trumpeting the implementation of Income Related Rents at a barbecue tomorrow but the four out of five low-income families who won&#39;t be getting a sausage from this policy aren&#39;t invited,&quot; National&#39;s Housing spokesman Tony Ryall said today.</p>
<p>&quot;This policy is unfair to those on low-incomes who can&#39;t get a State house. The waiting lists for State houses will soar as demand for cheap accommodation rises.</p>
<p>&quot;How is the Minister going to reduce the waiting lists for State houses if no-one wants to leave?</p>
<p>&quot;What incentive is there for State house tenants to earn a higher income when the Government will claw-back up to 91 cents for every extra dollar that they earn?</p>
<p>&quot;The 80% of low-income families who will miss out on income-related rents because they don&#39;t have the right landlord will be having a far different Christmas than their neighbours. The cost of living for these families, like others in New Zealand, is a real issue under this Government,&quot; Mr Ryall said.</p>
