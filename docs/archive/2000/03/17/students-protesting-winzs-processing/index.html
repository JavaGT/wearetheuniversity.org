<p>Students Protesting Winz&#39;s Processing</p>
<p>Approximately 300 Victoria and Massey Universities students presented their Human Submission to Minister of Education Trevor Mallard at parliament today.</p>
<p>The submission was a symbolic gesture highlighting the unsatisfactory handling of student loans and allowances by WINZ Student Services. Students called for the resignation of WINZ CEO Christine Rankin.</p>
<p>&quot;Students are furious and WINZ&#39;s mismanagement is simply unacceptable. Even at today&#39;s action there are students who have not received any loan or allowance,&quot; Nick Henry, VUWSA Campaigns Officer said</p>
<p>In addition to the resignation of Mrs Rankin, students called for a Universal Student Allowance. &quot;A universal allowance would be easier to administer than the current system,&quot; said Mr Henry.</p>
<p>&quot;We see the universal allowance scheme as a genuine solution to the out of control loan debt and inequitable access to tertiary education. There has to be a concerted effort to look at the long term benefits rather than the short term cost,&quot;</p>
<p>Although students see this as a realistic solution the current WINZ problems have not decreased.</p>
<p>&quot;The claim that students are not receiving payment because of incorrectly filled applications, ignores any responsibility of the many forms and documentation lost or the misinformation given by WINZ,&quot; said Welfare Vice-President Yadana Saw</p>
<p>&quot;We have students in severe hardship because of these errors which simply should not happen.]. The problem is not as acute because students are relying on friends, family, overdrafts, hardship funds and foodbanks for assistance,&quot; Ms Saw said.</p>

<p>&quot; What we are witnessing is an abdication of responsibility from the organisation [WINZ Student Services]. Lip service will not pay for books, food and rent,&quot;</p>
