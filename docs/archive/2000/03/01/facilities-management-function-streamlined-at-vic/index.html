<p><strong>Wednesday, 1 March 2000, 4:30 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>The staff structure and functions of Victoria University’s Facilities Management has been streamlined following a review of the group.</p>
<p>Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor Roy Sharp, says staff were told last Wednesday that 12 positions in the Facilities Management Group have been disestablished while six new positions will be created.</p>
<p>Staff affected by the move will have the opportunity to apply for the new positions.</p>
<p>The review of the Facilities Management structure follows the outsourcing of the grounds maintenance and building maintenance services at Victoria.</p>
<p>Professor Sharp says a reduced staff structure within Facilities Management is a logical consequence of moving to contracted services.</p>
<p>“As services become outsourced there are fewer management and administrative functions performed internally. For example, a contractor now handles the purchasing of grounds and building supplies, a function once carried out by Facilities Management staff.</p>
<p>“Further efficiencies are gained by reducing layers of management and grouping similar remaining functions together.”</p>
<p>In December last year Facilities Management Group managers were briefed in the first stage of consultation around a proposed new structure.</p>
<p>Facilities Management staff had until 28 January this year to make submissions on the proposed structure.</p>
<p>Professor Sharp says it is anticipated the change process toward the new Facilities Management structure will take up to three months to complete.</p>
<p>Counselling and support services are available for all affected staff.</p>
