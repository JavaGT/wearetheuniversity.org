<p><strong>Tuesday, 28 March 2000, 5:35 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Wyatt Creech</p>
<p>Opposition Health Spokesperson</p>
<p>28 March 2000</p>
<p>Health Minister&#39;s black prognosis for wage round</p>
<p>The Health Minister has revealed today she has refused to find any extra funding to ensure nurses and doctors get a pay rise, Opposition Health Spokesperson Wyatt Creech said.</p>
<p>&quot;Annette King has confirmed the fears of hospital staff that there won&#39;t be one cent extra from the Government&#39;s coffers to lift their pay rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister has told Parliament today that &quot;she will not be seeking financial provision in the Budget specifically to fund a pay increase for doctors, nurses and other hospital staff&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;She has also told the House that &quot;pay increases for staff will have to be funded from normal operational funding.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year Annette King went into bat for nurses at Waikato Hospital for a 2 per cent pay rise - and condemned the National Government for supposedly blocking it.</p>
<p>&quot;Now she&#39;s got the chance to ensure they do get a pay increase she won&#39;t deliver.</p>
<p>&quot;Health professionals are already saying strike action is inevitable because Annette King has written to hospitals instructing them to be tough on pay rates.</p>
<p>&quot;She&#39;s just made it worse, by confirming she isn&#39;t even trying to deliver on her pre-election rhetoric and won&#39;t be funding any extra money for pay rises.&quot;</p>
