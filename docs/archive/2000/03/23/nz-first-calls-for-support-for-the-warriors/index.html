<p>NZ FIRST CALLS FOR SUPPORT FOR THE WARRIORS</p>
<p>New Zealand First has called on all New Zealanders to throw their weight behind the Auckland Warriors in their game against Sidney City at Ericsson Stadium on Sunday.</p>
<p>The leader, Rt Hon Winston Peters, said that the establishment of the Warriors as a full time professional team in one of the toughest competitions in the world was a major step for Rugby League in this country.</p>
<p>“The code represents an ideal for thousands of young New Zealanders, and it gives some of them opportunities which would have otherwise not existed.</p>
<p>“We should stop knocking our sports teams when they go through a streak of misfortune and we should remember that the Warriors are in one of the hardest sports arenas of any code.</p>
<p>“They have been unlucky in a couple of games and they have been without Stacey Jones, their key play maker, for all games so far this season,” said Mr Peters.</p>
