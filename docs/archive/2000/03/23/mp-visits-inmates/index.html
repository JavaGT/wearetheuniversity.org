<p><strong>Thursday, 23 March 2000, 4:49 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National MP David Carter visited three inmates, yesterday, to check that they are being well treated during their five week incarceration.</p>
<p>These were not prison inmates but contestants in a competition run by Wellington radio station The Edge. Six ‘inmates’ are locked in an inner city apartment with their every move being broadcast live over the Internet. People are invited to vote for any of the inmates and at the end of each week the inmate with the lowest number of votes is released.</p>
<p>“As a Canterbury MP, I am urging everyone to vote for Anna Johnson as she is the only mainlander left in the contest and with just ten days to go she needs our support, said David Carter.</p>
<p>“I am sure that Christchurch and South Island residents will all want to vote for Anna as the $10,000 prize for winning the competition will flow back into our community. In light of the Government’s recent ACC and Employment Relations legislation it will be greatly needed.</p>
<p>“This is a great chance for the South Island to once again assert its supremacy,” concluded Mr Carter.</p>
<p>People can vote for Anna either on the Internet at <a href="http://www.theedge.co.nz">www.theedge.co.nz</a> or by ringing 0800 The Edge.</p>
<p>Ends.</p>
