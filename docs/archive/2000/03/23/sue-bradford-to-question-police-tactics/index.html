<p>Sue Bradford To Question Police Tactics</p>
<p>Green MP Sue Bradford will today question new police methods of dealing with demonstrators during question time this afternoon.</p>
<p>Ms Bradford&#39;s question will be around the same time as students from Hamilton protest against WINZ and their handling of student finances. The question and the letter to demonstrating students are attached.</p>
<p>Question for Oral Answer: My question is to the Minister of Police and asks, What is the Government&#39;s policy in relation to nose holds, choke holds and similar tactics in dealing with people on demonstrations?</p>
<p>23 March 2000</p>
<p>To Fightback Waikato</p>
<p>Congratulations and very best wishes for your demonstration this afternoon. I hope your protest is constructive and peaceful and that police do not resort to the brutal methods as were employed in Auckland last week.</p>
<p>I will be asking a question in Parliament this afternoon to ascertain whether the Government supports these tactics against demonstrators or not. I have included this question and will forward the Government&#39;s answer as soon as I receive it.</p>
<p>The Green Party supports your call for Christine Rankin to be sacked and for a complete overhaul of WINZ, in the way it treats both students and beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Yours in solidarity</p>
<p>Sue Bradford Green Party MP</p>
