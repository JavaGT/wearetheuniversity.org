<p><strong>Friday, 31 March 2000, 10:57 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Fightback">Fightback</a></strong></p>
<p>Occupying students at the University of Waikato march to Hamilton City Centre today, celebrating their successful two day control of the University&#39;s B Block.</p>
<p>They are to be joined by students from the Waikato Polytechnic and the battling students of Auckland, in a demonstration for Free Education through the streets of Hamilton.</p>
<p>Mayor Russ Rimmington has supported their call for Free Education, and the march will finish at the Council Buildings, where the Waikato Occupiers have been awarded the freedom of the city to speak out against student debt and poverty.</p>
<p>&quot;Every hour we were in occupation, represents a year of debt repayments for the average student before they pay off their student loan. Our message to the Labour party is simple- the Honeymoon is over.</p>
<p>&quot;The majority of Labour MPs sitting in the Beehive benifited from Free Education, yet they have the arrogance to tell this present generation it is unrealistic. This weeks co ordinated nationwide action and occupation by Fightback is a warning shot to the Labour Party.</p>
<p>&quot;Abolish student debt, loans and fees, and bring in a decent Universal Student Living Allowance. If you don&#39;t, we&#39;ll be back with twice the strength, and we will close every campus in the nation. You had free education, now we demand our rights. You have been warned.&quot; said Fightback spokesperson Joe Carolan.</p>
