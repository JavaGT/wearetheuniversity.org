<p>Hawkes Bay Principals Discuss Next Bulk Funding Move</p>
<p>A group of Hawkes Bay Principals concerned at the Government’s Bill to abolish bulk funding have today met with ACT Education spokesman Donna Awatere Huata to discuss their plans to oppose the Bill.</p>
<p>A Ministry of Education Report yesterday contradicted Education Minister Trevor Mallard’s claim that no school would be worse when they are forced back to centralised funding. The Report, tabled at the Education and Science Select Committee showed the majority of the 836 bulk funded schools would each lose thousands of dollars under a return to centralised funding.</p>
<p>Donna Awatere Huata said the Report confirmed the fears of bulk funded Principals and Boards of Trustees who have not been reassurred by the Minister’s unsubstantiated claims. “They have also been shaken this week by Trevor Mallard’s payout to schools who remained centrally funded. It was a divisive move to punish bulk funded schools despite the innovation and excellence they have shown in the education of their students,” she said.</p>
<p>“A steering group has been set up from today’s meeting and the group has agreed to hold a series of meetings with parents and Boards of Trustees.</p>
<p>“Despite the Minister’s ‘advice’ to both myself and Principals opposing the abolition of bulk funding to desist, we will continue to campaign against his plans to drag our schools back ten years.</p>
<p>Mrs Huata said she is on the road meeting with Principals around the country to set up similar groups.</p>
