<p>Chinese school certificate announcement welcomed</p>
<p>Opposition Ethnic Affairs Spokesperson Pansy Wong has welcomed the announcement that Chinese will be a School Certificate Examination subject from this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year National implemented Chinese as a Bursary subject and was keen to also offer it as a School Certificate subject. I am really pleased that the new Government is continuing the good work we started and that the announcement has been made in time for this academic year.</p>
<p>&quot;Internationally, the Chinese language will become increasingly prominent. 1.7 billion people are of Chinese ethnic origin and it is important that New Zealand is able to develop links with them.</p>
<p>&quot;We should encourage participation by our students in the Chinese language. Effective communication with these international communities will enhance our capability both culturally and economically.</p>
<p>&quot;It is also important for our growing Chinese community that their children are able to maintain their mother tongue,&quot; Mrs Wong said.</p>
