<p><strong>Friday, 24 March 2000, 3:05 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The resignation announced today of Independent Biotechnology Advisory Council (IBAC) convenor Professor Peter Gluckman should be followed by official disbanding of the whole body, Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said.</p>
<p>Minister of Research, Science and Technology Pete Hodgson said today Prof Gluckman had resigned &quot;to be more involved with a University of Auckland start-up company working on novel pharmaceuticals for treating brain disease.</p>
<p>&quot;He was concerned to avoid any possible conflict of interest with IBAC,&quot; Mr Hodgson said in a statement.</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons said she wished Prof Gluckman, who had long been a strong promoter and practitioner of genetic engineering, had recognised his conflict of interest earlier. She said that rather than waste money on a replacement, the Government should immediately end IBAC.</p>
<p>&quot;The funding should be diverted to the awaited Royal Commission of Inquiry into genetic engineering,&quot; Ms Fitzsimons said. &quot;IBAC no longer has a role. It was set up by the last government as a way of trying to head off such a commission. It has consulted with people individually and in private - a process which has not provided a forum for public debate or an opportunity for people with different views to learn from each other, as we hop the Royal Commission will do,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;While a new GE advisory body might follow the commission, it will certainly not be as pro-genetic engineering as IBAC. Its role and membership should be determined after government has received and considered the recommendations of the Royal Commission.&quot;</p>
<p>ends</p>
