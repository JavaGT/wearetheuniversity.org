<p><strong>Friday, 24 March 2000, 9:36 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Green MP Nandor Tanczos completes his speaking tour of New Zealand tertiary institutions today, having visited over a dozen universities and polytechnics during their orientation weeks.</p>
<p>Nandor has a series of engagements in Wanganui today which will officially bring his tour to a close. He said the tour was exhausting but incredibly rewarding and encouraging, and that the Green message went down extremely well with students.</p>
<p>&quot;It was really encouraging to see young people begin to show an interest in politics again after years of disinterest,&quot; he said. &quot;I really appreciated the opportunity to listen to and talk with so many people with so many good ideas on how we can make this country, and this world, a better place.&quot;</p>
<p>Nandor gave speeches to crowds of up to 600 students and covered issues such as the environment, tertiary education, restorative justice, the Treaty of Waitangi and cannabis law reform.</p>
<p>On his tour Mr Tanczos accepted invitations to attend commemorations at Moutua Gardens in Wanganui and a national hui on drug use among Maori youth in Whangaruru. He gave a talk to ten-year-old school children, attended an alternative school in the Hawkes Bay, gave a press conference to journalism students, gave over 40 interviews and held over 15 public meetings.</p>
<p>Mr Tanczos said he was overwhelmed by the awareness of young people on a wide range of issues and was delighted at student interest in the Greens.</p>
<p>Since the election over 700 people have joined the Green Party, many as a direct result of the campus tour.</p>
