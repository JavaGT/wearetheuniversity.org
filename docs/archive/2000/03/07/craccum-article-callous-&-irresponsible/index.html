<p>“The problem is not that suicide is being discussed. The problem is the way that this tragic and difficult subject has been callously sensationalised by Craccum whose readership represents the age group most at risk.</p>
<p>“Last year’s editors of Craccum were warned by the University’s councillors not to publish the article. Despite that warning not only was the article published it goes so far as to describe councillors and their clients as ‘losers’.</p>
<p>“Rather than trying to understand the circumstances that may lead young people to the point of despair where they consider taking their own lives. The point of the writer seems to be to attack and ridicule not only those needing help but also those who are trained to help.</p>
<p>“New Zealand has one of the highest youth suicide rates in the Western World. Some years more young people die by their own hand than on our roads. Suicide has devastating consequences for families and friends, some of whom never get over the unexplained loss of their loved one. To treat this issue in such a sensational and insensitive manor is completely irresponsible.</p>
<p>“In publishing this article Craccum’s editors have done a grave disservice not only to their own reputations but that of their magazine and to the students and staff at Auckland University,” said Muriel Newman.</p>
