<p>Wednesday 8th Mar 2000<br>Rodney Hide<br>Media Release -- Economy</p>
<p>ACT Finance spokesman Rodney Hide said today that Michael Cullen and the government had made a joke of the Budget Policy Statement by producing a flimsy document that lacks credibility.</p>
<p>“Dr Cullen signalled the problem yesterday in a speech when he said it was his intention to “subvert” the forecast and that the BPS would need to be analysed with “fresh eyes and fresh attitudes”.</p>
<p>“He’s right about that. The Labour and Alliance government simply cannot fund their promises with increased spending of just $5.9 billion over four years. That’s just $3 billion more than the previous so-called “mean” National Government had set aside.</p>
<p>“The Alliance-Labour government has already blown an extra billion dollars and the elderly – none of which helps to close the gaps. That leaves just $2 billion for Labour and Alliance to spend over the next three years over and above what National had ear-marked. That’s an increase of less than 2 percent of government expenditure. It’s not credible.</p>
<p>“These are rubber numbers. There’s no way that Alliance and Labour can deliver on their promises of closing the gaps, of income-related rentals, of business development grants, of Treaty settlements, and massive changes to the Health system, with just $2 billion over three years.</p>
<p>“The BPS also shows that the Government has failed to cost key decisions. Only two decisions – student loans and the super boost – have been costed. The BPS confirms this is a government struggling to cost its feel-good policies and to put them into practice.</p>
<p>“I challenge Dr Michael Cullen to declare that he can hold his government to the fiscal track he has signed off on in his very first BPS,” said Rodney Hide.</p>
