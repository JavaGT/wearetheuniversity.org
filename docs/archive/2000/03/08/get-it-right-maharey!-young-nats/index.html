<p><strong>Wednesday, 8 March 2000, 3:25 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Young_Nationals">New Zealand Young Nationals</a></strong></p>
<p>&#39;Get It Right Maharey!&#39;</p>
<p>Young Nationals today called for Steve Maharey to admit he is incompetent,and stop blaming everybody else for student loan administration problems.</p>
<p>&#39;It has been made clear that Social Services Minister Steve Maharey had full knowledge that changes to the Student Loan system would mean loan applications would increase dramatically, and that the Work and Income New Zealand - who now administer the loans system - would struggle to cope with the extra workload.&#39;, said Nationals Youth Vice President Daniel Gordon.</p>
<p>&#39;Yet, despite this advice, Maharey has persisted with Labours policy of giving free loans and wiping interest.&#39;</p>
<p>&#39;What resulted is that a massive 46% additional loan applications have been received by WINZ. Is it any surprise that WINZ has had administrative difficulties?&#39;, asked Daniel Gordon.</p>
<p>&#39;Maharey should remember that under National only 51% of students actually have a loan. This figure is now likely to be in the area of 70% to 80% at some institutions.&#39;</p>
<p>&#39;Free loans do nothing to reduce student debt, Maharey. Students are not dumb - of course they will borrow money en masse when you are print money to hand it out to them. And of course WINZ, or indeed anyone administering the system, will struggle to cope with the extra demand&#39;.</p>
<p>&#39;Despite this obvious problem, Maharey has spent the last two months blaming WINZ for problems that in fact originated at the cabinet table. When that doesnt wash any longer, he tries to blame the previous government!&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;Oh, yes you are dead right Maharey. Its Nationals fault that students have rushed to get their free loan from Labour. Its National fault that officials warned you of administrative problems that you failed to ignore. And its Nationals fault that 46% additional loan applications were received by WINZ, meaning inevitable problems with the extra workload&#39;, said Daniel Gordon.</p>
<p>&#39;This debacle is another example of the famous &#39;Maharey Principle&#39; - if you are wrong, blame the previous government. If someone asks you why you can&#39;t deliver on your promises, tell them it is because you are now the government,&#39; concluded Daniel Gordon.</p>
<p>Ends.</p>
