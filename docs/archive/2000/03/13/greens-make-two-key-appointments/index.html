<p>March 12, 2000</p>
<p>Two key appointments at Parliament have been made by the Green Party.</p>
<p>Danna Glendining has been appointed Office Manager, while Caucus Secretary is Peter Davis.</p>
<p>Danna combines a good knowledge of Parliament, the Wellington bureaucracy and the Green Party. She was secretary to Green MP Rod Donald in 1997 and before that, in 1994, to Alliance Leader Jim Anderton. She has worked in the public service since 1986, principally in the field of equal employment opportunities.</p>
<p>Danna also has considerable background of the Green Party having spent three years as administrative co-convenor of the party, and standing as Green-Alliance candidate for Wellington - Karori in 1993 and for Wellington Central in 1996. She was campaign manager for the Electoral Reform Coalition in the lead up to the MMP Referendum. Danna is also well known nationally through her involvement in many aspects of the women&#39;s movement, and with the rural social issues of depopulation and community development.</p>
<p>Peter has also had a long involvement with the green movement in New Zealand. In 1990 he wrote the successful New Zealand Green Guide (Penguin) and continued his environmental advocacy through other books, articles and a green magazine which he co-founded. He has held key positions in the organics movement and the Green Party. His diverse past includes setting up a successful bean sprouting business in the UK, running an organic market garden near Motueka, and assisting businesses with environmental initiatives. Peter also has a strong academic background with a Masters in Geography and was engaged in PhD studies in the area of environmental policy.</p>

<p>In his role as Caucus Secretary, Peter is responsible for providing political advice to caucus, managing caucus meetings and briefings, and keeping the party up-to-date with happenings inside Parliament. His position also involves liasing with other parties in Parliament, including protocol negotiations with the Government.</p>
<p>Party Co-Leader Rod Donald said he was pleased that the parliamentary office had found appointees who combined such strong strategic and management skills with many years of experience in the Green movement.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re fortunate to have appointed such high calibre people to these senior positions in our parliamentary team,&quot; Mr Donald said.</p>
