<p>Monday 6th Mar 2000<br>Muriel Newman<br>Media Release -- Other</p>
<p>It’s the day of reckoning today for over 5,000 low-paid workers about to lose their jobs as a result of new Labour Government policy.</p>
<p>“From today, the Government has instructed businesses that they must increase their minimum pay rates by 8%…in the face of clear advice from the Labour Department that the direct result will be the loss of up to 5,200 jobs,” said Muriel Newman, employment spokesperson for ACT.</p>
<p>“In one of the most heartless decisions a government could take, Labour has chosen to completely ignore the guidance of its professional advisers, that increasing wages without increasing productivity can only result in jobs being destroyed.</p>
<p>“This new Labour Government has tried to portray itself as caring, particularly for those struggling on low incomes,” Ms Newman said.</p>
<p>“Yet in one of its first decisions, it has condemned thousands of young and first time-workers to go back to the dole, just when they were enjoying the rewards and learning the skills that would make them valuable members of the workforce.</p>
<p>“This is ideology gone mad,” Ms Newman said. “Labour-Alliance claims its top priority is to create jobs and cut unemployment, yet today’s action is the very reverse of that.</p>
<p>“The minimum wage is generally paid to new, young and unskilled entrants to the workforce, enabling them to get a start. Now, that start is being denied, simply so Labour-Alliance can keep its promises to trade unions that higher-paid workers already in jobs will get more,” Muriel Newman said.</p>
