<p><strong>Thursday, 16 March 2000, 4:49 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Around 180 students from the Otago University, Otago Polytechnic and the Dunedin College of Education today held a protest against the delays and problems in the processing of student loans and allowances by Work and Income New Zealand (WINZ). Students rallied outside the Students Services branch of WINZ for an hour and then delivered a set of demands: copy attached.</p>
<p>&quot;On the eve of the closing date for submissions into the WINZ inquiry, this protest sends a clear message to Government that students will not accept anything less than major systematic changes to loan and allowance administration. The inquiry needs to make significant changes to ensure these problems don&#39;t happen again,&quot; said Andrew Campbell, OUSA President.</p>
<p>&quot;Auckland, Canterbury and now Otago students are demanding that the government change the way loans and allowances are administrated. Now it is up to them to deliver,&quot; said Mr Campbell.</p>
<p>&quot;Students from the three tertiary institutions have stood up as a group and demanded change in the way loans and allowances are being handled. Students are sick of the delays and problems that they get when dealing with WINZ,&quot; said Katie Grace, Otago University Students&#39; Association (OUSA) Campaigns Coordinator.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly WINZ is not geared for students&#39; needs, so we demand that loan and allowance administration be returned to tertiary institutions.&quot; said Katie Grace.</p>
<p>&quot;While loans and allowances are a start to barrier-free education students want true barrier-free with Universal Student Allowances,&quot; concluded Katie Grace.</p>
