<p>Biodiversity Report recipe for disaster</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s report on biodiversity on private land, released today, is a blueprint for years of costly argument and litigation, according to Opposition Environment Spokesman Richard Worth.</p>
<p>&quot;This is effectively a proposal to spend large sums of money on scientific and planning studies, leading to the protection by law of a small proportion of the total area of native forest and wildlife habitats on private land. Such an approach is not going to satisfy either side of this vexed debate.</p>
<p>&quot;The end result will only aggravate existing tensions. New Zealanders will be outraged to discover that thousands of patches of native bush are classified as &#39;insignificant&#39; and will become available for clearance. People on neighbouring properties will find that, for spurious &#39;scientific&#39; reasons, they are left with differing sets of property rights.</p>
<p>&quot;The overheads on local authorities will increase substantially. The money will be wasted on planning processes and arguments, rather than practical steps like fencing off areas of bush.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s biodiversity policy included a commitment to securing &quot;no net loss of New Zealand&#39;s indigenous vegetation cover&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Our policy recognizes from the outset, without spending millions of dollars on consultants&#39; reports, that all indigenous vegetation is of real value, and that landowners have a duty to conserve it. Public funds should be available to help landowners with this duty, but such funds should be focused on practical measures such as fencing and pest control.</p>
<p>&quot;There are situations where small areas may be approved for clearance, a no-net-loss policy would require equivalent areas of the same vegetation to be re-established elsewhere,&quot; Mr Worth said.</p>
