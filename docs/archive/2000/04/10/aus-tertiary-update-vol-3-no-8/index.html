<p><img src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/graphics/auslogo.gif" alt="AUS website"><br>NO CERTAINTY YET ON FUNDING<br>We will have to wait until after the Budget in June to find out the<br>Government&#39;s intentions regarding the former Government&#39;s decisions to<br>institute the Universal Tertiary Tuition Allowance and to severely curtail<br>postgraduate tuition funding.<br>In response to our request last week, the Hon. Steve Maharey has given AUS<br>an assurance that a clearly differentiated sector, and the funding<br>principles that underpin this, will form part of the Tertiary Advisory<br>Commission&#39;s programme. AUS sees the realignment of funding as being a<br>priority for TEAC when it is finally established.</p>
<p>Also in Tertiary Update this week:<br>1. TEAC Chair Welcomed<br>2. Polytech Alliance Will Lower Fees and Staff Costs<br>3. Crossbearer and Whitefoot Strike Again<br>4. Otago Proposal Disenfranchises Academics from Voting on Council<br>Representation</p>
<p>TEAC CHAIR WELCOMED<br>The appointment of Dr Norman Kingsbury as chair of the Tertiary Education<br>Advisory Committee has been welcomed by the Association of University Staff<br>(AUS).</p>
<p>AUS President Neville Blampied said Dr Kingsbury has a great wealth of<br>knowledge and experience which will provide a very sound foundation to TEAC.<br>&quot;Dr Kingsbury has an intimate knowledge of how universities, other tertiary<br>institutions and the Ministry work, and he is universally respected within<br>the sector,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>JOB LOSSES LIKELY FROM POLYTECH ALLIANCE<br>The Association of Staff in Tertiary Education (ASTE) were not impressed<br>that Otago Polytechnic staff found out about a new polytech alliance and<br>potential job losses from the Otago Daily Times.<br>The Tertiary Accord of New Zealand announced this week, involves Otago<br>Polytechnic, Auckland&#39;s MIT, Palmerston North&#39;s Universal College of<br>Learning (the former Manawatu Polytechnic) and Christchurch Polytechnic.<br>ASTE president Jill Ovens told the Otago Daily Times the union was concerned<br>that there might be intellectual property issues at stake in the<br>announcement that a key focus would be on the joint development and delivery<br>of programmes.<br>Otago Polytechnic CEO, Wanda Korndorffer, said student fees were to be<br>limited and staffing costs were predicted to fall as a result of the<br>alliance.</p>
<p>CROSSBEARER AND WHITEFOOT STRIKE AGAIN<br>Putting the AUS views before the public is assisted from time to time by a<br>morphic organisation, whose latest manifestation was as the Association for<br>United Science.<br>The chief spokespersons for this Association - Neville Whitefoot and Rob<br>Crossbearer - leapt to the defence of universities when it was suggested by<br>Dr Andrew West (see Tertiary Update Vol. 3 No.7) that only by merging<br>universities could New Zealand develop at least one world-class institution.<br>In a press release embargoed until 1 April 2000, Crossbearer and Whitefoot<br>supported rumours that a merger of Crown Research Institutes into a new<br>Department of Science and Innovation - DSI - was the only way to achieve a<br>critical mass expertise within NZ&#39;s research and development sector.<br>Organisations ringing the AUS for further information were gently advised to<br>check the date of the release!</p>
<p>OTAGO PROPOSAL DISENFRANCHISES ACADEMICS FROM VOTING ON COUNCIL<br>REPRESENTATION<br>Academic staff at Otago are bristling at the Vice-Chancellor&#39;s proposals for<br>the Senate that would see a downgrading of their voting rights on the<br>University Council representation.<br>Currently three of the Council&#39;s members are elected by academic staff. The<br>proposal involves the non-elected Senate having the capacity to &#39;elect&#39; two<br>of its members to be two of the three academic staff members of Council.<br>This would mean that academic staff could only directly elect one of the<br>three academic members of Council instead of three.<br>&quot;If the Vice-Chancellor wants overlap between the membership of Senate and<br>Council, there are other ways to achieve it short of drastically curtailing<br>the democratic rights of academics to participate in the governance of their<br>institution,&quot; said AUS Otago branch president, Michael Robertson. He<br>suggested that co-option was available to achieve overlap.</p>
<p>WORLD WATCH</p>
<p>· UK TREASURY APPOINTS NZ ECONOMIST<br>Current Director of Macroeconomic Forecasting and Policy in the New Zealand<br>Treasury, Roger Procter, has been appointed as Chief Economist in the Public<br>Services Directorate (PSD), one of the most senior and influential posts in<br>the UK Treasury.<br>His is the second appointment from outside the Civil Service to the Board of<br>PSD in the last two months.</p>
<p>· UNION TO CHART CHANGING SECTOR<br>Changes in work patterns, funding, the user-pays trend and quality in<br>universities will be revealed in a national audit to be carried out by<br>Australia&#39;s National Tertiary Education Union.<br>The report resulting from the audit, which will identify crisis points and<br>problem areas in universities, will be released next year in time to link<br>with the federal election cycle.<br>NTEU president Carolyn Allport said the audit would focus on material that<br>was not currently collected. The union wanted to use the data not just to<br>raise public consciousness but to reflect the need for broader<br>accountability.<br>The NTEU project comes amid concern about the lack of an independent<br>government advisory structure, particularly with a deregulation agenda in<br>the offing. A progress report is expected by September.</p>
<p>NO EDUCATION VOUCHERS IN FLORIDA<br>In a tremendous victory for families and children, a Florida Circuit Court<br>found last month that the Florida State constitution means what it says --<br>that children are guaranteed the right to free, public education. As Judge<br>Ralph L. Smith Jr. stated, &quot;Tax dollars may not be used to send the children<br>of this state to a private school.&quot;<br>This ruling puts a stake in the heart of the voucher movement, sending a<br>strong signal across the States that vouchers are no substitute for a<br>quality public education.</p>
