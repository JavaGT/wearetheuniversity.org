<p><strong>Wednesday, 5 April 2000, 5:54 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Immigration Minster Liane Dalziel’s precedent setting decision yesterday, could see thousands of potential overstayers and refugees coming to New Zealand, said ACT Immigration spokesman Penny Webster.</p>
<p>Yesterday the Minister of Immigration granted residency to Viliami, and his family, using discretionary powers given to her under the Immigration Act. The Minster has stated that the Privacy Act prohibits her from discussing the reasons for her decision.</p>
<p>“It would appear the Minister is setting a very dangerous precedent for the 8,336 people currently awaiting residency approval. She is basically implying that if your residency is turned down just go to ground, wait a few years until you get caught, and you will be granted special consideration as of right.</p>
<p>“Arbitrary decisions like the Ministers will spread quickly through the migrant community. The potential overstayer will see New Zealand as a better bet for residency as compared to other countries. This perception of New Zealand being an “easy touch’ has the potential to create large immigration problems in the future.</p>
<p>“The Ministers decision will move like lightening through the migrant communities and immigration consultants . This will make New Zealand an attractive destination for that section of tourists who arrive in foreign countries with no intention of going home. It will also attract the thousands of refugee status seeking immigrants who roam the globe at any one moment.</p>
<p>“If this likely result of the Ministers secrecy does occur in New Zealand, we could well see our already overstretched prison resources crippled by the refugee influx.</p>
<p>‘I challenge the minister if Immigration to come clean on her reasons for the Mila family decision, so New Zealand does not become an ‘easy target’ for overstayers and refugees everywhere,” said Penny Webster.</p>
