<p>Max Bradford<br>Opposition Industrial Relations Spokesperson</p>
<p>18 April 2000</p>
<p>Govt. threatens services and livelihoods</p>
<p>The Employment Relations Bill will stifle Kiwi ingenuity and put the livelihood of thousands of people at risk, Opposition Industrial Relations spokesperson Max Bradford said today.</p>
<p>&quot;A whole new category of workers has flourished in recent years as they&#39;ve come up with fresh ideas and ways of delivering services as contractors in the new economy. But the ERB is about to change all that.</p>
<p>&quot;Clause 6 will force many independent contractors out of work or make them sign up as employees.</p>
<p>&quot;It has dire consequences for courier firms, IT consultants, those offering professional consultancy services, home-based carers, plumbers and builders on long-term construction sites, taxi drivers, and fishermen. Sharemilkers, insurance agents and real estate agents could also be hit, but nobody in the Government seems to know.</p>
<p>&quot;A forum on the Bill has been called in Auckland tonight for contractors to look at the ways they&#39;ll be hit by the law change.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bill turns these contractors into employees. That means they potentially lose tax benefits from being independent contractors, and they lose the independence and choice from being self employed.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bill means extra costs and hassles for the small employer at a time when we need to make it easier to do business not harder. People are worried their businesses won&#39;t survive, given it&#39;s already hard enough to employ people.</p>

<p>&quot;No-one at the coal face can work out why the Government is forcing thousands of self-employed contractors into becoming employees, when they don&#39;t want to be.</p>
<p>&quot;National will put up amendments to the legislation to get people exempt from the dependent contractor provisions.&quot;</p>
<p>Max Bradford will address the forum on the Employment Relations Bill at the Aotea Centre Kupe Room tonight between 5.30 and 7pm.</p>
<p>Ends</p>
