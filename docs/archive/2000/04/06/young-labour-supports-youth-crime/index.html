<p><strong>Thursday, 6 April 2000, 10:18 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Young_Nationals">New Zealand Young Nationals</a></strong></p>
<p>Nationals Youth Vice President Daniel Gordon today criticised Young Labour Vice President Jordan Carter, and Labour List candidate Yani Johanson, for their ridiculous claims that the under 25 sticker scheme discriminates against young people.</p>
<p>Daniel Gordon also applauded Waimakariri MP Clayton Cosgrove, who has endorsed the scheme. &quot;Mr Cosgrove clearly understands the scheme has gone some way in targeting the problem of car theft, and its good to see some common sense and normality from the Labour Party,&quot; said Mr Gordon.</p>
<p>&quot;It is bizarre that Young Labour is in agreement with Alliance Youth Affairs Minister Laila Harre about the scheme, despite Labour MPs supporting it. It appears the so called Young Labour is no more than a merry band of politically correct nobodies who are ignored by the senior party.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I challenge Jordan Carter or Yani Johanson to tell me how a single under 25 year old is discriminated against by a sticker on a car window,&quot; said Daniel Gordon.</p>
<p>&quot;The facts speak for themselves. The scheme is an overwhelming success. It is a problem of the youth. You just don’t catch 80 year olds nicking cars. This year of the 39 offenders caught for car conversion - 35 were under the age of 17. How many more cars would have been stolen were it not for the stickers?&quot; asked Daniel Gordon.</p>
<p>&quot;The only people discriminated against are car thieves. Next Young Labour will be telling us that shoplifters are discriminated against because shops install security cameras in toy shops.&quot;</p>

<p>”I am surprised that Young Labour have not been more vocal against insurance companies – all of whom charge higher premiums for younger drivers, especially males. Is this discrimination?” asked Daniel Gordon.</p>
<p>&quot;Will Young Labour be calling for regulation against insurance companies charging higher premiums as well? Or perhaps regulation to prevent bus companies from asking school students to stand and allow adults to sit down when it is full?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Its time that Young Labour grew up and confronted the real issues,&quot; concluded Daniel Gordon.</p>
