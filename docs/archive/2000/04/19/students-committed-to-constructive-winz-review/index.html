<p><strong>Wednesday, 19 April 2000, 11:39 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Aotearoa_Post_Compulsory_Student_Union">Aotearoa Post Compulsory Student Union</a></strong></p>
<p>The National Student Unions today said their focus during the Government&#39;s evaluation into WINZ&#39;s handling of student loans would be on getting things right for students in 2001.</p>
<p>Today the Minister of Social Services annouced the details of an evaluation into WINZ&#39;s handling of student loans processing and invited the national student bodies, APSU and NZUSA to make submissions.</p>
<p>&quot;It is common knowledge that student loan processing has been a nightmare for thousands of students this year and we are committed to making sure that it is never allowed to happen again,&quot; said David Penney National President of the Aotearoa Post-compulsory Student Union.</p>
<p>&quot;Our top prority is to make sure that loans in 2001 will be delievered in a timely and efficient manner,&quot; said Sam Huggard, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students Association.</p>
<p>&quot;We are grateful to the Minister, Steve Maharey, for acknowledging the problem straight-away and now following through with his promise of an independent investigation into student loan processing,&quot; said David Penney.</p>
<p>&quot;APSU and NZUSA have, through their constituent associations, been gathering a wealth of material on WINZ&#39;s processing of student loans this year, including a casebook of student grievances, and we are confident that if our recommendations are followed this debacle won&#39;t be repeated in 2001,&quot; concluded Sam Huggard.</p>
