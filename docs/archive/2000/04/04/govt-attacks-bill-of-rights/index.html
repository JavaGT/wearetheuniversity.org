<p><strong>Tuesday, 4 April 2000, 2:15 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels">Prebble&#39;s Rebels</a></strong></p>
<p>A Government move which cements compulsory membership of students associations is an attack on the Bill of Rights Act and inconsistent with both moral and international obligations, according to concerned students.</p>
<p>The Education Amendment Bill, due to be debated in Parliament this week, has been labelled as an attack on our fundamental fredoms by youth group Prebble&#39;s Rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;Compulsory membership of a political student group flies in the face of the Bill of Rights Act, which guarantees the freedom of association&quot; said Rebel President, Clint Heine.</p>
<p>&quot;Student unions have a legacy of mismanagement and unaccountability. A recent Victoria University survey shows that more than a quarter of students there were dissatisfied with their association. This is a pattern repeated across the country, where students are forced to pay high levies to political extremists who, despite their rhetoric, are more interested in pushing a political agenda than serving students.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Once again, the Government thinks that they can make better decisions for us than we can for ourselves. We get to choose whether or not to join a political party, but Helen Clark wants the power to decide whether or not we join a militantly political student union.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Heine said &quot;the Government denies that it wants compulsory unionism with the Employment Relations Bill while at the same time denying students the right to choose not to join their students association.&quot;</p>
<p>Ends</p>
