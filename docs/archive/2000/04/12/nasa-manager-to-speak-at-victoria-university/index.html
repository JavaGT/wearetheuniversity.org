<p><strong>Wednesday, 12 April 2000, 10:58 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Bob Mitchell, Project Manager of the Cassini mission to Saturn and Mission Director of the Galileo mission to Jupiter will give a free public lecture at Victoria University&#39;s School of Chemical and Physical Sciences on Thursday April 13.</p>
<p>Mitchell has had &#39;hands on&#39; roles as a leader and manager of planetary exploration programmes at NASA&#39;s jet propulsion laboratory for 35 years.</p>
<p>He has come to New Zealand primarily to talk at the Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand’s annual conference this coming weekend.</p>
<p>Mitchell is the Project Manager for the two-story-tall robotic spacecraft Cassini that is currently on its way to Saturn, the most distant planet that can easily be seen by the unaided human eye.</p>
<p>Cassini will reach Saturn in July 2004. It carries a number of high-tech scientific sensors to support 27 different investigations into the mysteries of the Saturn system.</p>
<p>Saturn has an interesting atmosphere and interior, spectacular ring systems, numerous icy satellites with a variety of unique surface features, and the moon Titan, which is slightly larger than the planet Mercury, and whose hazy atmosphere is denser than that of Earth.</p>
<p>Cassini will begin to transmit its findings from Saturn during the 2004-2008 period.</p>
<p>Mitchell began his career at NASA&#39;s jet propulsion laboratory in 1965 working on trajectory design, mission design and navigation for planetary exploration missions, including Mariner &#39;67 (which explored Venus), Mariner &#39;71 (the first Mars orbiter), and the Viking orbiter and lander missions to Mars.</p>

<p>Bob Mitchell is also the Mission Director and Project Manager of the Galileo mission to Jupiter, beginning as Mission Design Manager in 1979.</p>
<p>For the past four years the Galileo spacecraft has been exploring the<br>Jupiter system and is sending back to Earth many magnificent images and a huge amount of scientific data from the giant planet and its family of moons. This new information has greatly expanded knowledge of the<br>Jupiter system and also helped to provide some answers to many questions about the origin and evolution of the Solar System.</p>
<p>In his lecture entitled &quot;Galileo-Mission to Jupiter&quot; Bob Mitchell will share his &#39;inside&#39; view of planetary exploration projects. The presentation will cover the results and achievements of this successful mission and will be illustrated by many of the Galileo images.</p>
<p>Victoria &#39;Reader&#39; and astrophysicist Denis Sullivan, describes Mitchell as<br>&quot;a very experienced scientist and engineer in the NASA hierarchy who will provide unique insights into the exciting explorations of our planetary neighbours&quot;.</p>
<p>The lecture is at 7:30 - 8:30 pm in MacLaurin Lecture Theatre 3, gate<br>6, Kelburn Parade, School of Chemical and Physical Sciences, Victoria University.</p>
