<p><strong>Monday, 3 April 2000, 4:19 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) is welcoming today&#39;s announcement that Dr Norman Kingsbury has been appointed as the chair of the government&#39;s Tertiary Education Advisory Committee (TEAC).</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Kingsbury has our full support in his new role,&quot; said Sam Huggard, Co President of NZUSA.</p>
<p>&quot;He was the clear choice for the government, as he been involved in an extensive range of areas within tertiary education. Among other positions he has been the Chair of both the Academic Audit Unit and the Polytechnic Programmes Committee, chaired a number of reviews of issues within the sector, and has been involved with international student associations, as well as local and national ones in New Zealand. He has also forged strong links with Maori educators,&quot; said Sam Huggard.</p>
<p>&quot;His task is a huge one. The tertiary sector in New Zealand is in a weak position at present, with staff morale low due to uncertainty and endless restructuring, student costs rising and a culture of managerialism that puts balance sheets ahead of quality.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Associate Education (Tertiary) Minister has said that the competitive model in tertiary education is dead, but it will take time to rectify a pro-market culture that has developed over the last decade,&quot; said Sam Huggard. &quot;TEAC is a good way to begin this process, and to rebuild focus in the sector.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Kingsbury is a man of intelligence and integrity, and will fulfil the role aptly. We wish him all the best, and look forward to working with him,&quot; concluded Sam Huggard.</p>
<p>Ends.</p>
