<p><strong>Thursday, 20 April 2000, 1:15 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Steve Maharey&#39;s view on consultants is as changeable as the weather, says National Work and Income spokesperson Belinda Vernon.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday he announced a company of consultants to investigate student loans processing, but today he is outraged at the cost of consultants used in another WINZ investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only that, he is now trying to claim credit for something he never lifted a finger for.</p>
<p>&quot;It was WINZ, not Steve Maharey, that held an inquiry into its processes and changed them. It was the Auditor General, not Steve Maharey, that investigated the charter incident. It was the State Services Commissioner, not Steve Maharey, who investigated the charter incident and the Chief Executive&#39;s conduct.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey has a reputation for saying there are things you can say in Opposition but not in Government, but he&#39;s taken it one step further. Now he can&#39;t hold the same opinion for two days in a row.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government is incapable of making a decision without establishing an inquiry or review to tell them what to do. Public servants are more than capable of carrying out this evaluation, so why doesn&#39;t the Government trust them to do the job? Arguments about neutrality are no excuse.</p>
<p>&quot;The new Government has pledged to restore the depth and expertise in the public sector. Labour Ministers have said they believe there is an overuse of consultants in the public sector, and that using them for core responsibilities in the public sector was unacceptable.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey is again saying one thing and doing another,&quot; says Belinda Vernon.</p>
