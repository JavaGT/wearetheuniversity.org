<p>Proposed Agenda for the Hui in Ham</p>
<p>1. PRESPECTIVES SESSION-Where are we at in the campaign for National occupations for free education?</p>
<p>A national analysis of the state of the struggle. Overall evaluation of the first round of occupations and actions.</p>
<p>a. at every campus except Canterbury, the movement is in a better position than it was at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>b. There are strong signs of a high level of passive support for the national objectives on all campuses (thousands of names on petitions) however</p>
<p>c. active participation is much lower...Police brutality...Craccum....Right wing execs but mostly</p>
<p>d. Illusions in reformism, the &quot;Honeymood period&quot; of the Labour government.</p>
<p>2. Analysis of the most successful actions- Waikato and Victoria What can be learned from the experiences of building and organising on these campuses</p>
