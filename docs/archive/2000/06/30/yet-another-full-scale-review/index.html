<p><strong>Friday, 30 June 2000, 1:18 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The new driver licensing system has been hugely successful, but it is appropriate to do some fine tuning, Opposition Transport spokesperson Roger Sowry said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The tough penalties for those caught driving in excess of 50kms over the speed limit who lose their licence, and the confiscation of thousands of vehicles from unlicensed drivers are making our roads safer. &quot;It was a big project - and a year down the track it is worthwhile doing some fine-tuning to keep improving it.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is questionable whether the cost of an independent reviewer spending the next five months carrying out a review is really worth it.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government is obsessed with reviews. Since it took power it has ordered or embarked on 27 reviews, inquiries and investigations.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s about one a week.</p>
<p>&quot;The driver licensing review could have been done by the Ministry of Transport.&quot;</p>
