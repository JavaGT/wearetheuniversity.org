<p><strong>Tuesday, 27 June 2000, 11:43 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Science may have eased the burden of care from countless New Zealand families today, said ACT MP Gerry Eckhoff.</p>
<p>An international team of scientists has announced the complete mapping of human genetic code. The breakthrough will allow scientists to discover, isolate and treat human diseases far more effectively.</p>
<p>“Thousands of New Zealand families who have been afflicted with the heartbreaking effects of Parkinson’s or Multiple Sclerosis will testify that today’s breakthrough is a revelation. The burden and anguish these families have faced may soon become a chapter of human history”.</p>
<p>The journey of gene discovery began in 1856 when Austrian monk Gregor Mendel began cross-breeding peas. He eventually discovered mathematical rules of heredity and concluded that heritable traits transferred in discrete units called genes. “Scientists have steadily progressed his findings through to today’s triumph.</p>
<p>“The unparalleled achievement of these scientists continues the important advancements science has given to human well being. Detractors of this discovery should speak to those who have endured the unpredictability of human disease.</p>
<p>“As Bill Clinton stated, &quot;It is now conceivable that our children&#39;s children will know the term &#39;cancer&#39; only as a constellation of stars.&quot;</p>
<p>“Today’s announcement is a triumph of human knowledge over the supporters of human ignorance,” said Gerry Eckhoff.</p>
