<p>Environment Centres acknowledged in Green budget</p>
<p>Green Party Co-Leader Rod Donald said the $300,000 initiative to fund environment centres as part of the Green Budget Package was acknowledgment of the important service they provide to the community.</p>
<p>The $300,000, from Vote Environment, will make grants of up to $50,000 per centre to assist them with day to day running costs such as administration and rent.</p>
<p>Mr Donald said the extra funding was a low-cost way to recognise the value of community environment centres and to give these centres some certainty, security and above all encouragement.</p>
<p>“Community environment centres are the public face of the environment and conservation movements in many communities and they play a very important role in providing information to the public, especially school students, and in co-ordinating local environmental initiatives,” said Mr Donald.</p>
<p>“From a personal perspective, I was the first paid director of the Christchurch Environment Centre in 1976 and I know first hand the struggle these centres fight just to stay alive. This funding will go a long way towards reducing this struggle and will free up more time and money for community environment projects.”</p>
<p>Mr Donald said community environment centres were a valuable resource for schools and often assisted the Department of Conservation, the Ministry of the Environment and local councils in distributing information.</p>
<p>“The Greens have supported an investment in environmental centres to build up community understanding and support for conserving nature and looking after the environment,” said Mr Donald.</p>
