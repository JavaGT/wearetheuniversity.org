<p>REBELLION IN THE 21st CENTURY-</p>
<p>Anti Capitalism- Theory and Practice Proposal for a national Anti Capitalism conference in the lead up to S11</p>
<p>By Joe Carolan, SWO Waikato Branch</p>
<p>A proposal has come up in our branch to hold a weekend of debate and discussion, aimed at youth and students, on the lines of the &quot;Students for Socialism&quot; events organised by the British and Irish SWP once a year.</p>
<p>Launched on a Friday Night, with workshops and sessions on Saturday and Sunday, it may give us a chance to put forward revolutionary arguments to the new anti-capitalist mood amongst young people.</p>
<p>This would also give us a chance to fraternally debate the way ahead with other members of the left and the S11 campaign.</p>
<p>The recent students for socialism conference in Trinity College Dublin was co-organised by the SWP, Uni Greens and the One World Society.</p>
<p>They had speakers from the refugee and asylum communities on the fight against racism, a debate between the SWP and a Monsanto public relations agent, as well as debates between revolutionaries, environmentalists and NGOs like Jubilee 2000, refugee groups and anti third world poverty groups on the nature of the IMF and World Bank.</p>
<p>More and more questions are being raised by people around our politics.</p>
<p>An exciting event billed as &quot;Rebellion in the 21st Century- Anti Capitalism, Theory and Practice&quot; may be a good way of widening the audience for revolution to people becoming radicalised by the post Seattle mood.</p>

<p>Envisaged sessions would be primarily of a debate format.</p>
<p>Some meetings proposed could be-</p>
<p>Friday night session REBELLION in the 21st Century- Speakers from Greens, Alliance, SWO, S11 campaign, Anarchist Alliance</p>
<p>SATURDAY Ecocide, Environmental Destruction and Genetic Frankenfoods- how can we save the planet? Greens, SWO, Native Forest Action, Greenpeace etc Poverty, Exploitation and Resistance in the Developing World SWO, member of the Refugee community (do they have an organisation?) , anti racist groups Students and Revolution- From May 68 to Indonesia SWO, Fightback campaign, international speaker?</p>
<p>SUNDAY Taking the Battle to the Heart of the Beast- Are western workers privileged or are they the key to defeating the IMF/World Bank? Debate between liberal NGO or Green and SWO with militant trade unionists, Water Pressure Group, State Housing Action Coalition and other working class activists The Media, ideas and resistance- How rightwing ideology is losing its strength SWO, media activist, left wing columnist</p>
<p>FINAL RALLY The Battle of Melbourne- Seattle in the South Pacific Shutting down the World Economic Forum Speakers from SWO, s11 Campaign and people going to Melbourne A rousing sendoff rally! We can use the Waikato Students Union building in Hamilton and our branch would go flat out building it as a national conference.</p>
<p>We would design very rebellious posters and leaflets for it for other SWO branches and invited groups to use.</p>
<p>We would promote the event in the student press and hope to get good delegations from Auckland, Wellington, Palmerston North- as well as plaster Hamilton.</p>
<p>We would also organise places for people to stay, food and childcare, extensive bookstalls and campaign materials from different groups, and a rocking gig on the Saturday night followed by a Carnival of the Oppressed party! We envisage holding it before S11, maybe the weekend a fortnight beforehand.</p>
<p>It will also serve as a place to announce actions for S11 across NZ to the media.</p>
