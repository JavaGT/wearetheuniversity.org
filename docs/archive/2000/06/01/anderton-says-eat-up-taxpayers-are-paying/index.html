<p><strong>Thursday, 1 June 2000, 5:07 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The trappings of power have gone to Jim Anderton&#39;s head with his comment that it was OK for the Ministry of Economic Development to lash out money for a meal for him at a flash restaurant, National MP John Luxton said today.</p>
<p>&quot;But to make matters worse, Jim Anderton is now denying he ever made the comment, which was reported in the Waikato Times.&quot; (Attached)</p>
<p>The Government today denied leave to Mr Luxton to table in Parliament the report from the Waikato Times of 26 May.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Anderton appears to have misled Parliament with his denial.</p>
<p>&quot;He denied that he made the reported comments at last week&#39;s graduation of Business Graduates from Waikato Polytechnic.</p>
<p>&quot;I have spoken to the reporter concerned and he confirms that his notes report Mr Anderton as meeting a businessman at a restaurant that was more expensive than he normally eats at, and saying it did not matter as the Ministry was paying for it.</p>
<p>&quot;Parliament deserves an apology from Mr Anderton. So do taxpayers for making the comment in the first place.&quot;</p>
