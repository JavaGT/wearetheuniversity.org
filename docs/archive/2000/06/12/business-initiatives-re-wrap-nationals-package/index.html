<p>Business initiatives re-wrap National&#39;s package</p>
<p>Since it has broken its own promises to business, the Budget&#39;s business initiative will be a creative repackaging of part of National&#39;s Bright Future package, National&#39;s Bill English and Max Bradford said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has dumped its own ideas to help business and to expand the knowledge economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Business expected tax breaks for research and development and the export guarantee scheme in the Budget. But they&#39;re not getting them.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#39;ve had to contend with higher taxes, new fringe benefit taxes, the ACC and Employment Relations Bill and plummeting business confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government faces a test of credibility towards business and the knowledge economy. So far the so-called bridge to business is built on broken promises.</p>
<p>&quot;Initiatives for business in the Budget should be measured against the National Government&#39;s commitment in the Bright Future package which helped business be innovative and expanded the skills of New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;National committed more than $220million over four years - including $47 million new funding for new programmes that drew on extensive consultation with individuals and businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;This Budget must deliver an integrated package for business that builds on the Bright Future ideas and investment, and not just fork out cash to pressure groups.&quot;</p>
