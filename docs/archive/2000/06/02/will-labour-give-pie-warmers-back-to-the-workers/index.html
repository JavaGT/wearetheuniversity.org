<p>Phil Heatley</p>
<p>MP for Whangarei</p>
<p>2 June 2000</p>
<p>Will Labour give pie-warmers back to the workers?</p>
<p>&quot;313,000 new jobs may have been created over the past nine years - but that may have taken a toll on the warmth of worksite pastry-goods,&quot; says National&#39;s Whangarei MP Phil Heatley.</p>
<p>At a select committee hearing in Auckland today the Northern Amalgamated Workers Union made a submission complaining about the range of household appliances available on work-sites for construction workers.</p>
<p>Their chief gripe? &quot;Fridges, pie warmers and heaters which were common prior to the ECA are today a wondrous sight to behold&quot;.</p>
<p>Those words came from union secretary Ray Bianchi - who was heavily involved in the Marsden Point project which was nearly crippled by strike action.</p>
<p>Whangarei MP Phil Heatley says &quot;The Employment Relations Bill may end up costing tens of thousands of jobs and causing strike action to skyrocket. However it&#39;s reassuring to know that it could mean a boost in sales for our burgeoning Pie Warmer manufacturing sector.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Except they&#39;ll probably be on strike - demanding waffle irons and foot spas,&quot; Mr Heatley added.</p>
