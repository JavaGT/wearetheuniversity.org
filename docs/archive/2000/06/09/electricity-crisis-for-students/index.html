<p><strong>Friday, 9 June 2000, 2:55 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Otago University students are in a state of crisis because of blocked efforts to receive their electricity bills, the Otago University Students&#39; Association said.</p>
<p>&quot;Several students have come into OUSA with problems in receiving their electricity bill. One students&#39; flat is going on six months with no sign of an electricity bill.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The company at fault have blamed everyone, from the previous government to the last tenants electricity company.&quot; said Katie Grace, OUSA Campaigns Coordinator.</p>
<p>When questioned, the company claimed that due to the competitive nature of the electricity supply industry, companies were slow to pass information between each other, and that it was the wait for information that caused the delay.</p>
<p>&quot;The electricity company claims to be waiting for the information to be passed from the previous tenants&#39; electricity company. This causes huge problems for students, who often move flats from year to year, and who therefore often change electricity suppliers.&quot; said Ms Grace.</p>
<p>&quot;OUSA is concerned at the number of students in Otago and New Zealand, who may be affected by this problem, and don&#39;t know how to handle it. Sooner or later they will receive a large bill, and be under stress to pay it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Students, and the public in general, should not be suffering for the faults of companies who did not think their actions through.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;OUSA urges these companies to take quick action to resolve problems in processing the information, to help relieve the pressure placed on their customers.&quot; concluded Ms Grace</p>
<p>The OUSA will be starting an information campaign to inform the students of the problems and to help relieve them.</p>
