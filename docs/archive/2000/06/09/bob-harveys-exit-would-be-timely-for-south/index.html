<p><strong>Friday, 9 June 2000, 2:41 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Reports that the Prime Minister is pushing Labour President Bob Harvey not to stand for re-election are good news for South Islanders, says Canterbury National MP David Carter.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Bob Harvey&#39;s latest display of anti South Island sentiment has finally been his undoing.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously Helen Clark has realised she can&#39;t rely on Auckland alone for support, in the wake of her minority Government&#39;s diminishing support and a dramatic slump in business confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;Bob has not helped her situation by alienating South Islanders with comments such as &#39;We don&#39;t necessarily like anything about the South Island. We don&#39;t care much about it&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not the sort of comment anyone would expect to hear from the boss of one of the governing parties. But maybe we shouldn&#39;t be too surprised, as Mr Harvey has long been an embarrassment to Labour, with other crass actions such as allegedly &#39;down-trouing&#39; at a member of the public.</p>
<p>&quot;Even an arrogant Labour Government cannot afford to ignore South Islanders . Maybe with Bob Harvey gone the South can start to be recognised as part of New Zealand again,&quot; said David Carter.</p>
