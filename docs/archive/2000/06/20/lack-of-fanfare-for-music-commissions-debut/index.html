<p>Opposition Broadcasting Spokesperson</p>

<p>Lack of fanfare for Music Commissions debut performance</p>
<p>If the Government&#39;s serious about it&#39;s new Music Industry Commission hopefully they&#39;ll begin showing a bit of enthusiasm about it, says National&#39;s Broadcasting spokesperson Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government&#39;s spent so much time arguing over Fisheries Commissioners that the appointment of 11 new Music Commission board members, who met for the first time this week, seems to have escaped its attention. The Ministry of Culture didn&#39;t even bother formally announcing the names when they were decided on,&quot; Ms Rich.</p>
<p>Katherine Rich says she has no problem announcing those names on their behalf - they are Mahinarangi Tocker, Dave Dobbyn, Susan Wilson (B Net radio), Liam Ryan (tertiary education), Maria Carter (music teacher), Derek Lowe (Radio Broadcasters Association), Murray Cammick (Independent Record Labels), Arthur Baysting (APRA), Mike Chunn, Terence O&#39;Neill-Joyce (Record Industry Association) and Barbara Cuttance - Rampage Media</p>
<p>&quot;If the Government can&#39;t even be bothered announcing the new Music Commission members - you have to wonder whether they&#39;ll fully appreciate the input those people can make.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#39;re a talented bunch, from kiwi rock icon Mike Chunn (ex Split Enz and Citizen Band) to Dave Dobbyn, the ubiquitous Arthur Baysting and Radio Broadcasters Association&#39;s Derek Lowe for a commercial overview, I have a good feeling about the makeup of the Commission Board and like other Kiwi music lovers expect big things.</p>
<p>&quot;You just have to hope the low-key start isn&#39;t indicative of a Government which will mouth the right words about New Zealand music but ignore what the industry and performers really have to say,&quot; Katherine Rich says.</p>
