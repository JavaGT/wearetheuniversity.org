<p><strong>Thursday, 15 June 2000, 8:40 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>&#39;Repositioning&#39; virus spreads to Victoria University</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) is tonight alarmed at news that Victoria University of Wellington may have to make as many as 120 staff redundant because of financial troubles, and is hopeful that there will be some relief for the institution in tomorrow&#39;s Budget.</p>
<p>The Evening Post tonight reported that the University was facing a budget deficit blow-out of more than the previously anticipated $6 Million. Rumours are rife that as many as 120 staff may be affected by the blow-out, similar to the number of proposed staff cuts at Massey University in the wake of their repositioning exercise.</p>
<p>&quot;The University has already shed nearly 50 staff this year and it certainly could not sustain the loss of over a hundred more without a serious impact on the quality of tertiary education provision at the institution,&quot; said Sam Huggard, Co President of NZUSA. &quot;We urge the University to deal to this matter with care and compassion for those involved.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;University management, staff and students have all called on the government to address this urgently. We hope that the Budget tomorrow will signal a serious reinvestment back into tertiary education, and reverse a decade of government cutbacks in per-student funding.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Labour-Alliance government have found themselves in a unenviable position. But they will need to show leadership in addressing the growing crisis of under-resourcing in the nations tertiary institutions,&quot; concluded Sam Huggard.</p>
