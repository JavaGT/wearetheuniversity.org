<p><strong>Thursday, 15 June 2000, 5:54 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>

<p>Govt breaks health election promises</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has broken its health election promises, &quot; Opposition Health spokesperson Wyatt Creech said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The extra money for operations is about a third of what Labour promised.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders were expecting $200million a year for waiting lists. They&#39;re getting $74million.</p>
<p>&quot;All that does is continue the money in the Waiting Times Fund that needed topping up anyway, and National would have done it anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;The Health Minister has let down thousands of New Zealanders who expected Labour to deliver on its election promise to pour hundreds of millions of dollars a year to cut waiting lists.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government promised to implement the Mental Health Blueprint - but they&#39;ve fallen $40million short of what was needed.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is also admitting huge cost over-runs with its health restructuring. The $30million budgeted is over seven times more than they told New Zealanders it would cost.</p>
<p>&quot;It is appalling that the Government is taking $100million a year off smokers with their tobacco tax - and is only putting in a meagre $5million a year for smoking cessation initiatives. New Zealanders expected more than that.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s nothing in here to cut the cost of going to a doctor, for cheaper prescriptions or better and more health services for most New Zealanders. The health spending is a major letdown for most people.&quot;</p>
