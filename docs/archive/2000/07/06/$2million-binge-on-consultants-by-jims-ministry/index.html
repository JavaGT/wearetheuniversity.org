<p><strong>Thursday, 6 July 2000, 3:37 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Jim Anderton&#39;s new Ministry has spent-up on consultants to the tune of $2million in just four months, Opposition Industry and Regional Development spokesperson John Luxton said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Jim Anderton has been preaching to New Zealanders that &quot;consultants would be eliminated from the public services, and that the money would instead go on &quot;nurses, fire fighters and teachers&quot;. (Waikato Times 20.10.99)</p>
<p>&quot;But what have we got today? The Deputy Prime Minister defending his Ministry of Economic Development for spending $2 million on 116 consultancies for the following things:</p>
<p>* $90,949 to design and apply a new logo * $18,000 to layout two Government reports and a new corporate folder * $12,000 for new office floor plans * $127,000 to give the Deputy Prime Minister immediate support * $49,000 to organise a conference * $20,000 to promote BIZ programme * $125/an hour for someone to attend a meeting in Paris</p>
<p>&quot;Then there&#39;s the almost half million dollar consultants fees for the Electricity Inquiry and the $170,000 so far for the Telecommunications Inquiry</p>
<p>&quot;Jim Anderton wrote to Government Departments earlier this year saying the &quot;employment of consultants was contrary to the Government&#39;s overall aims of developing public sector capabilities. He also said the is determined to reduce the use of consultants and see their use ultimately eliminated.</p>
<p>&quot;His Department has $2million of consultants&#39; bills already. This is a clear case of Mr Anderton saying one thing in Opposition, and doing the opposite in power.&quot;</p>
