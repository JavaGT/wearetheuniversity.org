<p>Clayton Cosgrove Media Statement<br>Member of Parliament for Waimakariri</p>
<p>14 July 2000</p>
<p>Waimakariri schools receive property boost of $2,334,777</p>
<p>Member of Parliament for Waimakariri Clayton Cosgrove today welcomed the Government&#39;s property works programme for schools and said schools in the Waimakariri Electorate would benefit from it immensely.</p>
<p>Mr Cosgrove said 18 schools in the Electorate would receive property help over the next year with amounts ranging between $1500 and $1,078,613. The total funding allocation for the Waimakariri Electorate being $2,334,777.</p>
<p>This is on top of the $284,643.96 one-off payment made in March to centrally-resourced schools in the Waimakariri Electorate made possible because fewer schools entered bulk funding than the then National Government anticipated.</p>
<p>Nationwide, $403 million will be spent on school property this financial year.<br>That&#39;s a $30 million increase from the works programme of the previous Government.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re committed to delivering a better learning environment for both teachers and students as education enters the new millennium,&quot; Mr Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>&quot;Supporting growth and modernisation are the main targets of the property spend. With the deferred maintenance backlog finally out of the way there is more money available for general modernisation of schools than there has been for many years. I know many schools will be relieved to hear that news.</p>
<p>&quot;450 schools will be part of this year&#39;s general modernisation programme and will receive funding with an average budget of $215,000.</p>

<p>&quot;This is in addition to the 60 schools which are included in the new five-year property programme announced by Education Minister Trevor Mallard recently. Those schools will enter into agreements with the Ministry of Education to cover all their property expenditure required over a five-year period. By 2005, all schools will operate under this system.</p>
<p>&quot;Other aspects of the programme include new schools sites and classrooms in high demand areas and funding to cater for some health and safety property requirements.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Cosgrove said schools would also still have the option of funding from the Financial Assistance Scheme. The Ministry of Education will call for applications shortly and allocations will be announced in October.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government will support schools that are prepared to put their own money up front to help themselves, but not at the expense of centrally resourcing those that cannot,” Mr Cosgrove said.</p>
