<p><strong>Tuesday, 18 July 2000, 6:21 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Social Services and Employment Minister, Steve Maharey, has set a record for tough talk and no action, said ACT Welfare spokesman Dr Muriel Newman.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey is compromised on student loan handling because WINZ sought extra resources to aid student loan processing from him at Christmas, but he refused support.</p>
<p>“Today we have seen another report that criticises WINZ, and accountability for that sits with the Chief Executive, Christine Rankin.</p>
<p>“And for the tenth time, and after seven months as her Minister, Mr Maharey expects us to believe him when he says he will hold her accountable.</p>
<p>“That is a joke.</p>
<p>“After repeatedly calling for Ms Rankin’s resignation in Opposition, Mr Maharey performed a classic flip flop when informed by legal advisors that his comments may have gifted Ms Rankin the opportunity for a huge employment settlement.</p>
<p>“Mr Maharey now reverts to empty public rhetoric whenever a problem arises, and weakly promises that ‘I will hold people accountable’.</p>
<p>&quot;He has not, he will not, and he can not, hold Ms Rankin accountable.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey should be up front with the public and confess his limitations rather than continuing to erode his credibility by pretending to be tough, when his record proves the opposite,&quot; said Muriel Newman.</p>
