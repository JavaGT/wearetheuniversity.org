<p><strong>Thursday, 13 July 2000, 8:54 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Massey University &#39;repositioning&#39; 2nd draft still unacceptable - Students</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) said that it remained firmly opposed to the &quot;repositioning&quot; exercise currently being undertaken by Massey University, despite a softening of the proposed job cuts announced in tonight&#39;s second draft.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be dangerous for people to be lulled into a false sense of security by tonight&#39;s announcement of fewer staff cuts at Massey University&quot;, said Sam Huggard, NZUSA Co President.</p>
<p>&quot;While the proposed number of staff cuts has been reduced from 116 to 86 full time equivalent staff, this still represents a massive reduction in the number of staff at the university. We remain unconvinced that this will not have an adverse effect on the quality of Massey degrees.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;NZUSA is not opposed to the ongoing assessment of the nation&#39;s tertiary education needs, but Massey have gone about it in the worst possible way. The process has been thoughtless, blunt and divisive and has left staff with a bitter taste in their mouths. It is wrong for the Vice Chancellor to assert that the proposal represents &#39;responsible management of the University&#39;&quot;, said Sam Huggard.</p>
<p>&quot;NZUSA recently discussed this issue at our second annual conference in Palmerston North. We were firmly opposed to the repositioning exercise then, and nothing has changed with tonight&#39;s announcement from Massey University,&quot; concluded Sam Huggard.</p>
