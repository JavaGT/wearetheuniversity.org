<p>Tuesday 11th Jul 2000<br>Owen Jennings<br>Media Release -- Environment</p>
<p>Environment Waikato’s announcement of new plans to harass farmers spells bad news for rural businesses and their owners, said ACT Rural Affairs spokesman Owen Jennings</p>
<p>Environment Waikato announced the plans after the revelation that Cambridge pig farmer, Roger Johnson, has been forced into an out of court settlement to save his sanity and remaining equity.</p>
<p>“The handling of the Johnson’s piggery case demonstrates the worst face of Local Government bureaucracy. Rules were invoked that ignored the fundamental rights of land owners.</p>
<p>“Neighbours whom moved into the discounted, sub-divided land around the Johnson piggery have only themselves to blame for living with the natural smell of pigs. Environment Waikato have deteriorated to a complaint driven mentality, whose actions trampled over the Johnson’s existing use rights and totally their ignored private property rights.</p>
<p>“There is no more deserving case for compensation then the Johnson’s. They have incurred massive costs in disestablishing a successful business employing local people. Where is the New Zealand love of fairness for the underdog ,when a family, through no fault of their own, are evicted off their property by one organisation’s interpretation of the Resource Management Act?</p>
<p>“I am shocked that yet another New Zealand family can be so callously and unfairly treated by those who are supposed to represent them,” said Owen Jennings.</p>
