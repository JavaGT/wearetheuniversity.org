<p><strong>Wednesday, 19 July 2000, 4:56 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The cold reality of the Government&#39;s anti-business policies is hitting thousands of new victims as the country&#39;s employers face their first fringe benefit tax bills under the new high rate imposed by Labour, National&#39;s Revenue spokesperson Annabel Young said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Tomorrow is the deadline for the first FBT returns at the new rate - which is over 30% more than businesses paid under National.</p>
<p>&quot;As small business owners write out these bigger cheques they should remember that the FBT increase is one of five new taxes introduced by a Government that promised just one tax increase.</p>
<p>&quot;Businesses have every right to resent forking out more money tomorrow because the Government rammed through its pre-Christmas increase to the top personal tax rate without proper analysis or thought.</p>
<p>&quot;Many employers won&#39;t be able to do anything to avoid the higher FBT rate because they are locked into contracts to provide fringe benefits to employees and can&#39;t change the contracts just because the Government put the rate up.</p>
<p>&quot;Higher taxes will do nothing to help business out of the current crisis of confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the reasons businesses are worried about the future is the raft of higher costs that they are facing.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government keeps coming up with additional costs - like this FBT increase - that make it harder for businesses to make a decent living in New Zealand.&quot;</p>
