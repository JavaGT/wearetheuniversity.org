<p>Union Movement Wants New Zealanders<br>To Act Like Sheep</p>
<p>“With the passing of the Employment Relations Bill the Government is giving the union movement a monopoly over collective agreements. This is totally unnecessary and unfair,” said New Zealand First Industrial Spokesperson, Mr Peter Brown MP.</p>
<p>“There are thousands of New Zealanders in the workforce who are thoroughly capable of grouping together and negotiating their own collective agreements. If they have difficulty of a technical nature then they could always hire a bargaining agent for that expressed purpose without the need to form or join a union at all. Others might well want to join or form a union, equally so they should have that choice.</p>
<p>“However, with the likely emergence of ‘no frills unions’ and the established union officials criticising such, we have a situation where unions are saying they know better than the average kiwi. To make matters worse the Government is cementing in this ‘union knows best ’ philosophy.</p>
<p>“Frankly New Zealanders are not fools, indeed by and large they are very sensible people, with a high degree of industrial ‘know how’. It should be up to them whether they choose to be in a union or not to obtain a collective agreement, rather than having such an arrangement thrust upon them. I stress New Zealand First is not anti-union but we are opposed to unions having monopoly rights over collective agreements,” concluded Peter Brown.</p>
