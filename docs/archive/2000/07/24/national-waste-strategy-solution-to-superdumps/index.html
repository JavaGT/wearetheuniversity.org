<p><strong>Monday, 24 July 2000, 2:23 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Green MP Ian Ewen-Street today said the Green Party strongly opposed the proposed superdump in Waipara, near Christchurch, saying that a national zero waste strategy was the only way to stop the issue resurfacing.</p>
<p>&quot;The Green Party oppose these dumps on principle and see no need for them if New Zealand develops a goal of zero waste,&quot; said Mr Ewen-Street. &quot;While we acknowledge the Government has set up a waste working group the Greens believe such a strategy is becoming increasingly urgent.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ewen-Street said a zero waste strategy would need to fully recycle organic or green waste into fertiliser which could, in turn, create local enterprise opportunities such as the Mid Canterbury Wastebusters composting operation in Ashburton.</p>
<p>&quot;To achieve our zero waste strategy the Greens promote a shift of taxation away from incomes and onto waste, packaging and pollution,&quot; said Mr Ewen-Street. &quot;Currently the incentives are in precisely the wrong places.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ewen-Street said an example of better waste management was the South Australian system of placing financial deposits on drink containers such as milk, soft drinks and alcohol. The responsibility for the packaging of the product lies with the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Mr Ewen-Street said a zero waste strategy would remove the uncertainty and anxiety from the lives of people living near the proposed superdumps in both Waipara and the Waikato.</p>
