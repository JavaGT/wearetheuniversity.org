<p>Max Bradford</p>
<p>Opposition Industrial Relations Spokesperson</p>
<p>Wednesday 5 July 2000</p>
<p>Cullen delivers more bad news for business</p>
<p>The Finance Minister has confirmed there will only be cosmetic changes to the widely condemned Employment Relations Bill, Opposition Industrial Relations spokesperson Max Bradford said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Cullen delivered the bad news in Auckland today. Business will be disappointed that the Government&#39;s talk of its willingness to listen was just that - all talk.</p>
<p>&quot;At least 25 bottom-line amendments were needed if business was to see light at the end of the tunnel, and lift business confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;While it is good news the Government has agreed to National&#39;s fought-for changes to the independent contractor provisions, the Bill is still very restrictive and full of costs for business.</p>
<p>&quot;All Dr Cullen has done today is clarify the intention of the Bill - and that in effect means provisions such as union access to the workplace, replacement of striking workers, and director liability remain largely unchanged.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#39;s made it clear that the crippling provisions relating to the monopoly powers of unions, multi-employer bargaining, multi-employer strikes and costs of employment related education leave remain.</p>
<p>&quot;Now the Government has broken its silence on the changes, business and the thousands of people who made submissions on the original legislation should be allowed to make further submissions to the select committee.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government raised expectations in the business community that it would really listen.</p>
<p>&quot;What we&#39;ve seen to date does not meet those expectations.&quot;</p>
