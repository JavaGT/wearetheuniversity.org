<p>New Zealand First Gains Concessions For School Staff</p>
<p>“New Zealand First gained a significant concession for school staff during the committee stage of the Education Amendment Bill,” New Zealand First Education spokesman, Hon Brian Donnelly claimed today.</p>
<p>He said, “As the Bill was written, teachers and other staff members at a school would have had no priority right for the enrolment of their children at the school. New Zealand First won the support of the House for an amendment providing such a priority right for teachers. The Greens subsequently broadened the motion to include all employees of the Board.</p>
<p>The important issue is that the Bill now recognises the commitment of teachers and other school staff members to the well-being of the students, and the fact that school staff do not leave the grounds when the last bell of the day rings.”</p>
