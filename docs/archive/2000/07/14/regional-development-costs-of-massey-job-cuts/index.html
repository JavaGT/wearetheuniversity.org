<p><strong>Friday, 14 July 2000, 12:00 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Association_of_University_Staff">Association of University Staff</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS  WEB SITE"><br>Association of University Staff (AUS) representatives briefed Deputy Prime Minister and Alliance Leader, Jim Anderton, on Massey University&#39;s controversial &#39;repositioning&#39; and cost-cutting project yesterday.</p>
<p>&quot;We were keen to ask Mr Anderton&#39;s views on regional development and the place of regional universities in the promotion and support of the Government&#39;s policies for regional growth. In our view, Massey University&#39;s proposed job cuts for the Palmerston North campuses are totally out of step with these policies,&quot; said AUS Massey Branch President Associate Professor Tony Lewis.</p>
<p>&quot;We have sought the support of Mr Anderton, Palmerston North MP, Steve Maharey, and Minister of Education, Trevor Mallard, in ensuring that Massey University Council and management clearly understand the Government’s tertiary education and regional development policies and their implications for Massey’s ‘repositioning’ and cost-cutting project,&quot; said Professor Lewis.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that Mr Anderton understands the issues raised by the Massey ‘repositioning’ and shares our concern about the impact on the Manawatu region.</p>
<p>“We anticipate that, as Minister of Economic Development, Mr Anderton will closely monitor these developments. We are hopeful that our meeting will have positive benefits for staff, students, the University and the region,&quot; said Professor Lewis.</p>
