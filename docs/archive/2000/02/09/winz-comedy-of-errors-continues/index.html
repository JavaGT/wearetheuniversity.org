<p><strong>Wednesday, 9 February 2000, 11:18 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) remains unconvinced that Work and Income New Zealand Student Services are competent enough to deal with Student Loans and Allowances this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Following a comedy of errors last year, WINZ are proving incapable in their administration of loans and allowances. Despite assurances by WINZ in 1999 to the Social Services Select Committee and the public that allowances would be better managed this year, we believe that WINZ are not taking enough precautions for the student demand&quot; said Co President of NZUSA, Sam Huggard.</p>
<p>&quot;The most recent problem has seen 22,000 people receive student loan contracts with an incorrect institution printed on it. Tertiary students have faced other problems this year, mostly around misinformation from WINZ, delays on the phone, delays in receiving allowances and database interface problems between institutions and WINZ.</p>
<p>&quot;Many polytechnic students are returning to study in the next few weeks, and university students will be back by the end of the month also. This latest problem will create backlogs and further strains on the WINZ 0800 number and more delays for students.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;WINZ prides itself on its customer service, and it&#39;s clearly not up to scratch. WINZ needs to cease seeing students as percentage numbers and realise that students deserve better help from the public service. I can see the rush to student association foodbanks that we saw in 1999 continuing this year &quot; concluded Sam Huggard.</p>
<p>ENDS.</p>
