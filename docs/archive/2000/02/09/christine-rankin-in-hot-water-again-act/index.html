<p>Christine Rankin In Hot Water Again</p>
<p>Wednesday 9th Feb 2000</p>
<p>Muriel Newman Media Release -- Social Welfare</p>
<p>It seems that Christine Rankin&#39;s assurances to the Social Services Select Committee last year regarding the future administration of student allowances and loans by WINZ, were just hollow words, says ACT MP Dr Muriel Newman.</p>
<p>Dr Newman was responding to an Aotearoa Post-Compulsory Students&#39; Union claim that up to 22,000 students have received loan contracts from WINZ with incorrect details.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that despite Christine Rankin&#39;s promises to both a parliamentary select committee and to students, that with WINZ in charge there would be no major problems with loans and allowances, there clearly are. Last year many students were still waiting for their allowances for more than two months after courses had started. In some areas it was a complete shambles,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
<p>&quot;If 22,000 mistakes with loans have already occurred when the majority of students are still on holiday, I shudder to think of what&#39;s in store.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year Steve Maharey claimed that it was time for the duck-shoving at WINZ to stop. He said that Christine Rankin should admit she had failed to deliver the required services.</p>
<p>&quot;I now call on the Minister, Mr Maharey, to restore taxpayer faith in the public sector by assuring students that he has full confidence in WINZ and its Chief Executive to deliver,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
