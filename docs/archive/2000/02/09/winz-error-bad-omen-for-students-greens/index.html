<p>WINZ Error Bad Omen for Students - Greens</p>
<p>A WINZ computer error which sent incorrect loan forms to 22,000 students is a bad omen for students, Green Party tertiary education spokesperson Michael Tritt said today.</p>
<p>The error has led to incorrect enrolment details appearing on the student loan contracts. The Aotearoa Post-Compulsory Student Union said today the most common mistake was showing students who have enrolled at North Island universities as having enrolled at Canterbury University.</p>
<p>&quot;This error is extremely worrying as it shows that WINZ is still exhibiting the bureaucratic incompetence which caused so much stress and hardship for students last year,&quot; Mr Tritt said.</p>
<p>Mr Tritt said the error would cause confusion and anxiety to the 22,000 students, and would trigger an influx of phone calls to WINZ.</p>
<p>&quot;I am concerned about the students affected by this mistake, but I am more concerned that it could be a sign of worse things to come,&quot; Mr Tritt said.</p>
<p>&quot;Students have not forgotten the payment delays which caused many to resort to foodbanks, and some to face threats of eviction from rental properties.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I call upon social services minister Steve Maharey, who was a prominent critic of WINZ last year, to ensure that there is no further repeat of the errors and delays that WINZ has become infamous for,&quot; Mr Tritt concluded. ends</p>
