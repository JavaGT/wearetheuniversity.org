<p>Rt Hon Wyatt Creech<br>Opposition Health Spokesperson</p>

<p>Labour leaves Plunket up in the air over tens of thousands of dollars</p>
<p>The Labour-Alliance Government has left Plunket up in the air over the fate of tens of thousands of dollars following the ACC Minister’s refusal to give assurances over premiums, Opposition Health spokesperson Wyatt Creech said today.</p>
<p>“Plunket has implored the Government to give the current ACC system a fair go – because of the considerable savings Plunket has made.</p>
<p>“Plunket has had its premiums almost halved in the first year of operation – from $300,000 to $160,250.</p>
<p>“Dr Cullen has refused to ease Plunket’s concerns and reassure the Society that the premiums would not increase.</p>
<p>“Plunket has had a good experience with the current system and want it to continue.</p>
<p>“Plunket has used the savings to spend more on child health services and health and safety initiatives which encourage injury prevention.</p>
<p>“The new Government made a song and dance about the extra $230,000 they gave Plunket to extend the operation of Plunket-line.</p>
<p>“This is clearly a case of giving with one hand and taking away with the other.</p>
<p>“All Plunket is asking for is for the current ACC system to be given a fair go. It is a sentiment being echoed around the country but the Government refuses to listen.”</p>
