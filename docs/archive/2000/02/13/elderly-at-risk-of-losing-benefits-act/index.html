<p><strong>Sunday, 13 February 2000, 3:44 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT senior citizens spokesman Muriel Newman has hit out at the Government over playing &#39;mean and deceitful&#39; games with the elderly.</p>
<p>She says thousands of older people are likely to lose their community service card as a result of the Alliance $20 election bribe.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been contacted by many retired people who are terrified at the thought of losing their community service card entitlements,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Two thirds of superannuitants have a community services card, and for many, the $20 hand-out will take them over the limit of $18,847 for a single person and $28,000 for a married couple. WINZ has been fielding large numbers of telephone calls from distressed elderly people, but can&#39;t answer the question.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Newman said that although WINZ administers the community service cards, Health Authorities set the qualifying limit. The limits were last reviewed in 1997, and no current adjustment has been notified.</p>
<p>&quot;The loss of a community services card is worth much more than the pre-election bribe of $20 a week. If there is no change to the threshold, many pensioners will lose their entitlement. The government must immediately reassure the elderly that it intends to increase the threshold; otherwise the pension &quot;increase&quot; is will be clearly seen as a mean and deceitful ruse to save money,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
