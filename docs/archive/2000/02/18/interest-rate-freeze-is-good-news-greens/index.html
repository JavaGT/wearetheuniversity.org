<p>Interest rate freeze good news for students</p>
<p>The announcement that the student loan interest rate will be frozen at 7.0% for the coming financial year is a positive sign for students, Green Party tertiary education spokesperson Michael Tritt said today.</p>
<p>Steve Maharey, the minister for tertiary education announced this morning that the interest rate would have risen to 7.6% using the present formula, but will be frozen while the government conducts a review of the interest rate setting methodology.</p>
<p>&quot;This is good news because students will be paying less interest than they would have under the forumula used by the previous National government,&quot; Mr Tritt said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is also good news because the minister has indicated that he perceives a problem with the way that interest rates are set.&quot; Mr Tritt however believes that the frozen rate of 7.0% is still excessively high.</p>
<p>&quot;I am pleased that Mr Maharey is implementing a review of this iniquitous system, but the outcome must be more than just tinkering with the interest rate,&quot; Mr Tritt said</p>
<p>&quot;No-one should pay more than the rate of inflation on a student loan, and I hope that the minister gives serious consideration to implementing this.&quot; Mr Tritt also urged the government to address the underlying causes of student debt, rather than the interest rate alone.</p>
<p>&quot;Attention must be given to cutting fees and the implementation of a universal student allowance, only then will we begin to contain the debt problem,&quot; Mr Tritt concluded.</p>
