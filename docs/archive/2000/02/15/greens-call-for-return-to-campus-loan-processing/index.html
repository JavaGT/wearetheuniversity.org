<p><strong>Tuesday, 15 February 2000, 3:42 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Green education spokesperson Ian Ewen-Street is calling for student loan processing to be returned to tertiary campuses in light of more WINZ blunders at Canterbury University.</p>
<p>Yesterday 800 pre-enrolled students were told they were unable to enroll at Canterbury University until next week as WINZ had not processed their loan applications in time.</p>
<p>Ian Ewen-Street said that as Canterbury was the first university to begin enrolment, WINZ were off to the worst possible start.</p>
<p>&quot;Until they are enrolled and their fees paid these students cannot access the library, labs or computers, which means they basically cannot start studying,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year students were forced out of study and many had to borrow thousands of dollars while WINZ took months to process their allowances,&quot; he said. &quot;Given this year&#39;s shocking start to their handling of loans I hope the Minister responsible for WINZ, Steve Maharey, will stand by his promise to step in and personally deal with these new problems quickly,&quot; said Mr Ewen-Street.</p>
<p>Mr Ewen-Street said it was appalling that WINZ were trying to avoid taking responsibility for the difficulties which Canterbury University says will double their enrolment costs.</p>
<p>&quot;We want the Minister to immediately establish the scale of the problem and make sure the delays at Canterbury aren&#39;t occuring at every other tertiary institution in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;When individual tertiary institutions were handling the processing of allowances they could turn around an application in 24 hours. Events at Canterbury University show WINZ can&#39;t even do this in a week.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greens want to see the handling of student loans taken off WINZ and given back to tertiary institutions. Local and personal face-to-face processing has worked extremely well in the past and is obviously much more efficient than the remote call centres WINZ is running,&quot; he said.</p>
