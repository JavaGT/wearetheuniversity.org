<p><strong>Wednesday, 23 February 2000, 1:37 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Green Party said today that stricter controls on a genetically<br>engineered salmon experiment have failed to provide the wild salmon<br>population with enough of a safety net.</p>
<p>&quot;The stricter controls imposed by the Environmental Risk Management<br>Authority (ERMA) on the research by NZ King Salmon have brought the<br>containment standards up to the level required under the Hazardous<br>Substances and New Organisms Act, and of course I see that as an<br>improvement,&quot; said Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>&quot;But there is an important point everyone is missing - this research near<br>Blenheim is of no use unless it can lead to commercial growing of salmon in<br>sea cages, and salmon in sea cages escape,&quot; she said. &quot;While there are few<br>New Zealand studies about this, one overseas study has found that a quarter<br>of all `wild&#39; salmon from one river in Norway came from salmon farms.</p>
<p>&quot;I challenge King Salmon to declare that none of its non-genetically<br>engineered sea-caged salmon in the Marlborough Sounds have escaped. It<br>would contradict what we have been told by local fishermen, company staff<br>and by Conservation Department officers.&quot;</p>
<p>In a recent study by Purdue University (Indiana, United States) researchers<br>found that a 0.1 per cent intrusion of transgenic fish into a wild stock<br>could bring that population to extinction within 40 generations where the<br>gene reduces the offspring&#39;s ability to survive. They have dubbed this<br>decimation theory the &quot;Trojan gene hypothesis&quot;, on the grounds that the gene<br>gets into the population looking like something good but ends up destroying<br>the population.*</p>

<p>&quot;Uncontrollable incidents such as a hole being torn in the mesh or more<br>importantly in respect to King Salmon&#39;s Kaituna Hatchery near Blenheim -<br>flooding - could also potentially result in eggs escaping from research<br>tanks into the wild. To date there has been little monitoring of conditions<br>set by ERMA and we have seen nothing to reassure us that the integrity of<br>the new screens will be regularly checked.&quot;</p>
<p>Nelson-based King Salmon conceded last year that a small percentage of the<br>genetically engineered fish had been spawned with large, bumpy heads at its<br>Blenheim research facility.</p>
