<p>Dr Wayne Mapp, MP</p>
<p>Opposition Defence Spokesperson</p>
<p>24 February 2000</p>
<p>Govt defence agenda will write NZ out of region</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s defence stance means that New Zealand is in real danger of writing itself out of the region, National&#39;s Defence spokesman Wayne Mapp said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our most important defence obligation is to work with our closest ally, Australia, to maintain regional security, and therefore peace.</p>
<p>&quot;A defence force based largely around the army will not be able to play a full role in the ANZAC partnership. The Government can not afford to be cavalier in its obligations to our region.</p>
<p>&quot;A balanced defence force with air combat, naval combat and a strong army is essential to play a full part in the region. Anything less will be abrogating responsibilities that we ought to shoulder.</p>
<p>Dr Mapp&#39;s comments come in the wake of harsh criticism from Paul Dibb, from Australia National University. Professor Dibb said New Zealand was effectively already protected by Australia and was becoming a strategic liability.</p>
<p>&quot;Professor Dibb has made a good point. New Zealand must play a full part in regional security - or risk alienating our best friend, and our most important security partner - Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;We have made a substancial commitment to East Timor and I know that has been appreciated by the Australians.</p>
<p>&quot;But the stakes are high. This Government is quite simply gambling with New Zealand&#39;s future in a way that most New Zealanders, once they understand the full implications, will not be impressed with. The long term damage to New Zealand&#39;s relationship and reputation with Australia will be immense and could go well beyond our defence relationship,&quot; Dr Mapp said.</p>
