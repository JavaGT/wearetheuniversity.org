<p>Govt. Responsible For Huge Increase In Student Debt Level - ACT</p>
<p>Thursday 24th Feb 2000 Muriel Newman Media Release -- Other</p>
<p>New Government policies look set to bankrupt the next generation, says ACT MP Dr Muriel Newman.</p>
<p>Dr Newman was responding to an answer to a written question from Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey that shows present forecasts for student loan applications are nearly fifty per cent higher now that Labour&#39;s &#39;no interest&#39; policy has been introduced.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey&#39;s policy is enticing thousands of students who wouldn&#39;t have normally taken a loan, to unnecessarily go into debt,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
<p>&quot;In September 1999, there were 104,614 loans forecast for the period 1 January 2000 to 30 June 2000. After Labour&#39;s new policy, the figures were revised to 150,828. This is despite the fact that student enrolment numbers are basically remaining static.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth in loan applications look set to push student debt levels over the $6 billion mark by the end of 2002 which is almost twice the speed originally forecast.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year, Mr Maharey claimed that the &#39;crippling debt burden was forcing people to make perverse decisions and worrying some to the point of suicide&#39;, yet, now that he is in Government, he is putting in place policies to make the situation worse. This is the sort of U-turn that this Minister is becoming famous for,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
