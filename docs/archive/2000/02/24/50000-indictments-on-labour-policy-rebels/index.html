<p><strong>Thursday, 24 February 2000, 3:28 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels">Prebble&#39;s Rebels</a></strong></p>
<p>A student leader has supported ACT MP Muriel Newman&#39;s attack on the interest free student loans policy, saying that the number of new student loan applications are &quot;50,000 indictments on Labour policy&quot;.</p>
<p>Clint Heine, President of Prebble&#39;s Rebels, said that figures released by Dr Newman today showed almost 50% more students would take out student loans under Labour. Mr Heine said that the impact of this upon student debt levels would be crippling.</p>
<p>Clint Heine said &quot;Labour criticised the National government for leading students into poverty, and then introduced policies which are creating another 50,000 student debtors.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark&#39;s credit card commitment to students was &#39;a fairer loans scheme&#39;. Just how is it fairer when 50% more students are trapped in debt?&quot; Mr Heine asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The craziest part of Labour&#39;s policy is that all students have access to an interest-free loan, whether they need it or not. Are Helen Clark and Steve Maharey trying to say that giving universal, unsecured, interest-free loans is fair to either students or to the taxpayers who have to foot the bill?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Heine said &quot;Prebble&#39;s Rebels invite student unions, who constantly complained at the number of students taking out loans under National, to join us in protesting against Labour&#39;s policy of enticing more students into debt.&quot;</p>
