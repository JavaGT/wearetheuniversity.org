<p>Prominent Auckland lawyer, Peter Kiely has been appointed an Adjunct Professor in Victoria University’s School of Business and Public Management.</p>
<p>Mr Kiely has combined a distinguished legal career with a formidable record of public service and scholarly achievement. He is a barrister and solicitor of 19 years standing and a partner in his own firm and is widely recognised as one of New Zealand’s leading figures in the field of employment law.</p>
<p>Head of Victoria’s School of Business and Public Management, Professor Pat Walsh says he’s delighted with Mr Kiely’s appointment. &quot;Peter offers a strong background in law, public service and academic achievement and his appointment will further strengthen our schools teaching and research capabilities&quot;.</p>
<p>Mr Kiely has received Ministerial appointments as a Director of Work Insurance Limited and the Pacific Forum Line and as a member of the Legal Aid Review Authority and as Chairperson of the Minister of Foreign Affairs’ Advisory Committee on External Aid and Development. He is a Director of the America’s Cup Village and a trustee of the Nissho Iwai Foundation and the Catholic Caring Foundation.</p>
<p>His employment law expertise is not only confined to its practice. He has also made a large scholarly contribution to the field which has led to his close relationship with Victoria University’s Industrial Relations Centre and School of Business and Public Management. Mr Kiely is editor of Employment Procedures and Practice and has published no fewer than 37 scholarly articles and other contributions.</p>
<p>In addition Mr Kiely has published six of the annual Employment Contracts monographs which analyse the employment contract data produced by the FoRST-funded Employment Institutions Project. The monographs are published in conjunction with the highly successful annual Employment Contracts Act seminar series, held at six national locations and attended by more than 700 people.  </p>
