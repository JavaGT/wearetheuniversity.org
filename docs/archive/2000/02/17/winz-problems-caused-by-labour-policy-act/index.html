<p><strong>Thursday, 17 February 2000, 11:06 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>WINZ Problems Caused By Labour&#39;s Loan Policy<br>Student loan applications have dramatically increased this year under Labour&#39;s new interest free loan policy, says ACT youth affairs spokesman Muriel Newman.</p>
<p>Dr Newman said reliable sources in WINZ have confirmed her fears that student debt would skyrocket with Labour&#39;s &#39;borrow for free&#39; policy.</p>
<p>&quot;My sources have told me that while enrolment numbers are similar to last year, indications are that the number of students taking out loans will nearly double.</p>
<p>&quot;This is placing huge pressures on the administration of loans yet Steve Maharey is blaming WINZ boss Christine Rankin, instead of Labours ill devised policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Students are not having to think through the effects of their borrowing as interest is not being charged. Labour&#39;s policy is distorting their decision making.</p>
<p>&quot;The level of student debt is now predicted to reach $6 billion by 2003. Under the old scheme this was not supposed to happen until 2005.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour must take responsibility for the consequences of its policy. Its &#39;borrow for free&#39; scheme will leave us a legacy of debt,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
