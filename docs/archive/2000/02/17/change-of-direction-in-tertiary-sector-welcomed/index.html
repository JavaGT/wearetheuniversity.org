<p><strong>Thursday, 17 February 2000, 1:50 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Association_of_University_Staff">Association of University Staff</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/graphics/auslogo.gif" alt="AUS website"><br>The Association of University Staff (AUS) has welcomed the new direction in tertiary education policy signalled by the Associate Minister of Education, Steve Maharey, in Wellington today.</p>
<p>AUS President, Neville Blampied, said in Wellington today that it was enormously encouraging that the future needs of New Zealand as a knowledge society would be determined through a policy process that was collaborative, consultative and visionary.</p>
<p>“AUS strongly supports the concept of policy recommendations being made by a small group of well-informed, broad-thinking people with a strategic vision” he said.</p>
<p>“The establishment of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission (TEAC) by the new Government means a move away from a narrow view that tertiary education needed no planning because the ‘market” would determine policy direction.”</p>
<p>“Further, it promises a move to a co-operative and collaborative sector and away from the destructive competitive model that has prevailed for the past decade,” said Mr Blampied.</p>
<p>“We are especially pleased that the Government is committed to giving the TEAC an independent position in public sector structures and look forward to working with the members of TEAC and its secretariat once it is established.”</p>
