<p>Hon Nick Smith<br>Opposition Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>17 February 2000</p>
<p>Golden handshakes backfire on Govt<br>Breach of privilege complaint laid against Maharey</p>
<p>Opposition Education Spokesperson Nick Smith today lodged a breach of privilege complaint against Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey for deliberately misleading the House.</p>
<p>The complaint follows Mr Maharey&#39;s repeated denials in Parliament that he knew of the Victoria University Vice Chancellor&#39;s resignation.</p>
<p>&quot;On 8 February, 16 February and 17 February Mr Maharey denied having any discussions with the Chancellor of Victoria University regarding the resignation of the Vice Chancellor.</p>
<p>&quot;However in a letter today released by the State Services Commission the Chancellor stated that discussions had taken place last year and prior to the resignation being made public.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has got into a pickle by beating up golden handshakes while in Opposition, and now one occurs in Government, ducking for cover.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem started in January when Mr Maharey denied knowledge of the resignation of the Vice-Chancellor and he has since been digging himself deeper and deeper into a hole.</p>
<p>&quot;He first said he met the Chancellor of Victoria University on one date, the next day he says it was a completely different date, and now he denies the date of another even earlier discussion completely - even though there&#39;s a letter proving it.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is right? Queen&#39;s Counsel and former Victoria University Vice Chancellor Douglas White in his formal letter sent in his official capacity as Chancellor to the State Services Commissioner or Steve Maharey?&quot;</p>
