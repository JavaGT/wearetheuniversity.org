<p>Bitter disappointment at Mallard&#39;s actions</p>
<p>Thursday 17th Feb 2000<br>Donna Awatere Huata<br>Media Release -- Education</p>
<p>ACT Education spokesperson Donna Awatere Huata said today she had been inundated with calls from families who have just been told about the axing of the Whakapiki Tauira scheme - the TIE scheme for Maori - saying they are bitterly disappointed with the Government&#39;s actions.</p>
<p>&quot;What news does the Minister of Education Trevor Mallard have for the three and a half thousand Maori families who applied for the Whakapiki Tauira this year and who are now left with nothing?</p>
<p>&quot;This year children wanting to attend independent or Maori boarding schools; children needing out-of-school tuition, or money for school uniforms, or assistance with transport to attend a more distant school; or children wanting to attend integrated or Kurakaupapa schools - these children could have been helped.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Huata said the Minister&#39;s decision to scrap the scheme has convinced her that he has no idea how to close the gap.</p>
<p>&quot;Under the Minister&#39;s leadership the gap of educational achievement between Maori and non-Maori will never be closed. This gap shows Maori as amongst the worst achievers in the world in maths, reading, and resulting in a six hundred percent difference in bursary achievement.</p>
<p>&quot;Three years of research has consistently demonstrated that Targeted Individual Entitlement (TIE) will close the gap for Maori students. Whakapiki Tauira is a direct result from this three years of research.</p>
<p>&quot;In the last ten years the government has tried everything - bilingual education, Kurakaupapa education and targeting more Maori teachers. It will be difficult for any government to close these gaps swiftly, but the TIE scheme is a programme that can do it.</p>
<p>&quot;The axing of TIE, the axing Whakapiki Tauira, the axing of bulk funding are all moves in the wrong direction. I predict that the gap in reading, maths and bursary achievement will be wider in three years than it is today.&quot;</p>
