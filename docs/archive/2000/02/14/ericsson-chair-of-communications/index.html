<p>Victoria University of Wellington in association with Ericsson Communications Ltd has announced a world-wide search for an innovative and distinguished academic specialist in the field of Communications and Global technology to take up the recently created Ericsson Chair of Communications.</p>
<p>The university signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Ericsson in December for sponsorship of the new Chair. The agreement also provides for a generous prize for a top student in the graduate Master of Communications programme and the development of co-operative research into the impact of communications technologies on New Zealand society.</p>
<p>&quot;We are delighted to align ourselves with a leading company in the telecommunications industry and look forward to a very productive relationship with Ericsson that we hope will result in some exciting projects&quot; commented owena Cullen, Head of the School of Communications and Information Management at Victoria.</p>
<p>The agreement includes provision for Ericsson to collaborate on research undertaken by the Professor and students and to promote research into wireless internet communications.</p>
<p>Ericsson’s Managing Director in New Zealand, Goran Olsson, says Ericsson is providing a practical contribution to the communications and information technology industries by contributing to the education of high quality graduates in the field.</p>
<p>&quot;Funding this new position allows us to promote excellence in teaching and research in the area of Communications. This will strengthen the pool of skilled professionals in the field,&quot; Mr Olsson says.</p>
<p>Ms Cullen says, &quot;In the meantime we are looking forward to the search which will be a high profile exercise that strengthens contacts with leading professionals around the world and gives a great deal of publicity to Victoria University and to our sponsors Ericsson Communications in an international arena.&quot;  </p>
