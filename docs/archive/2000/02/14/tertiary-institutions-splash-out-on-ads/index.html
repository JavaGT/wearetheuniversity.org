<p><strong>Monday, 14 February 2000, 10:58 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>A 60 per cent increase in advertising spending by six tertiary institutions over the past two years is an outrage, Green Party tertiary education spokesperson Michael Tritt said today.</p>
<p>A study conducted by the Aotearoa Post-Compulsory Students Union (APSU) has revealed the large increase in marketing and advertising expenditure between 1998 and 2000, despite an increase of only 5 per cent in total student enrolments at the six institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that marketing expenditures at some tertiary institutions are equivalent to 10 per cent of student tuition fees is completely unacceptable,&quot; Mr Tritt said. &quot;Our universities and polytechnics are spending money luring students away from each other, instead of concentrating on providing quality teaching and research.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Tritt said the study clearly demonstrated the madness of the competitive model for tertiary education.</p>
<p>&quot;Tertiary education minister Steve Maharey has loudly pronounced that the competitive model of tertiary education is dead. I call upon Mr Maharey to keep his word and put a stop to this nonsense,&quot; Mr Tritt said.</p>
<p>&quot;I also call upon those running our tertiary institutions to stop behaving like corporate boards of directors, and to start acting in the public interest.&quot;</p>
