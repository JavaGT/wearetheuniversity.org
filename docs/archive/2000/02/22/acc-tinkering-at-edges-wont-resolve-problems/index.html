<p><strong>Tuesday, 22 February 2000, 10:24 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Tinkering at the edges of the ACC reforms won’t help most of the businesses, employers and social groups worried about the impact of the Government’s law change, Opposition ACC spokesperson Gerry Brownlee said today.</p>
<p>“Suggestions that the Government is considering some changes to the Accident Insurance (Transitional Provisions) Bill following concern from the Green Party amount to mere tweaking at the margins.</p>
<p>“There is fundamental and major opposition from a whole range of business and social groups about the Government’s ACC plans.</p>
<p>“Instead of making one-off changes for political convenience the Government should bite the bullet and just give the current ACC system a fair go.</p>
<p>“ACC Minister Dr Cullen made it very clear in the House less than a week ago that he would not listen to the concerns of farmers but there are now reports he prefers ad-hoc changes just to get the law passed.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of groups representing tens of thousands of New Zealanders have appeared before the select committee explaining how much safer workplaces are, and how much the current system is saving them.</p>
<p>“The Green Party is hearing these huge concerns. If the Government is going to make changes for one particular group it should be listening to all the fears – including those from churches, charities and other community groups - and make changes for all.</p>
<p>“A petition is currently circulating calling on the Government to put the ACC reforms on hold and give it a fair go. Details and more information about the Government’s ACC changes can be found on the National Party’s ACC website <a href="http://www.fairgo.org.nz.%E2%80%9D">www.fairgo.org.nz.”</a></p>
