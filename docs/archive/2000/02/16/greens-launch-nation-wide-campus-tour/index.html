<p>Greens launch nation-wide campus tour</p>
<p>Green MP Nandor Tanczos commences a nationwide speaking tour across all New Zealand universities, on February 21 at Lincoln University.</p>
<p>The tour, which coincides with university orientation weeks, will run for around two weeks and is designed to further develop the Green relationship with young people and the tertiary sector.</p>
<p>An NBR-Compaq poll last week showed in the 18 - 24 year age group the Green Party had 21 per cent support, level with National. The party had 7.1 per cent overall, up from 5.2 per cent at the general election.</p>
<p>Nandor will be giving speeches, holding public meetings and staffing stalls at various market days to meet with students and listen to the issues of concern to them. He will be the guest speaker at the launch of the Auckland University of Technology orientation week. He will be accompanied by other Green MPs when he visits tertiary institutions in their regions.</p>
<p>Nandor said he is excited about the tour and is looking forward to spreading the Green message as widely as possible. &quot;The Greens have taken tremendous heart from the surging support for the party from young people in New Zealand,&quot; he said, &quot;and we will not let them down.</p>
<p>&quot;This is support we feel very priviliged to have and we will not be taking it for granted. The Green Party plans to work extremely hard to build on this support and to achieve the goals we campaigned on,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nandor said that as the natural environment deteriorated faster and faster he was delighted to see a groundswell of environmental awareness and concern developing in New Zealand.</p>

<p>&quot;If the global environment is to be saved for future generations young people must lead the charge,&quot; he said. &quot;The mobilisation of our young people right now looks very positive and during this tour I will be urging more of our bright young people to become directly involved in saving the planet.&quot;</p>
<p>Nandor said he would be discussing a range of issues on the tour including cannabis decriminalisation and his vision for a restorative justice system.</p>
