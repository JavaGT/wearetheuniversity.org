<p><strong>Wednesday, 30 August 2000, 8:34 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Association_of_University_Staff">Association of University Staff</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE"><br>Organisation for the 24-hour strike at Massey University on September 1st is well underway. Union pickets on each campus will express staff members&#39; opposition to University management&#39;s dismal contract offer.</p>
<p>Union organisers have not only contacted members concerning strike action but are also contacting other staff members and students informing them about the issues in dispute and the plans for Friday&#39;s strike.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been in regular contact with the students&#39; associations who support the action we are taking and we thank them for this. We also acknowledge that a small number of members work in crucial activities in the Veterinary Clinic; the animals they care for must be fed and treated. These veterinary staff will be supporting the strike but continuing to work while wearing &#39;we support the strike&#39; stickers,&quot; said Combined Union Industrial Campaign speaker, Dr Karen Rhodes.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect all of our members to strike, of course, and we anticipate most will be on the picket lines. This is history in the making as it is the first ever strike at Massey. When other strikes have loomed in the recent past management has enhanced its offer for a settlement and the unions have ratified. We have never come this close to strike day without such an offer. We have indicated to the employer that we are willing to talk but our members will need to see significant movement from them before they will consider ratification,&quot; said Dr Rhodes.</p>
