<p><strong>Monday, 21 August 2000, 12:39 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels">Prebble&#39;s Rebels</a></strong></p>
<p>Hamilton residents should prepare to be embarrassed again by mayor Russ Rimmington with the news that a group of ageing communists are planning a new round of activism at Waikato University, Prebble&#39;s Rebels president Clint Heine said today.</p>
<p>In March this year, a group led by communists occupied buildings at Waikato University. &quot;Thinking he was at Berkley in the &#39;60s, Russ Rimmington rushed in to support the group and congratulated them on their occupation. In the process Mr Rimmington made a mockery of the rule of law and embarrassed the good people of Hamilton,&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Rimmington is obviously upset that he missed the summer of love in &#39;68, and seems to think there are more votes in cuddling communists than kissing babies,&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>
<p>&quot;The mayor obviously has no idea who he was endorsing when he fawned over the March occupation. The group organising the occupations are a bunch of tired communists from Auckland. If Mr Rimmington wants to support the communist revolution he should give up local body politics, grow a beard, borrow a Che Guevera t-shirt and move into a squat,&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m sure Hamilton ratepayers would prefer that the mayor concentrated on sorting out local problems, such as the Tainui Novotel situation,&quot; Clint Heine said.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in the revolutionary credentials of the leader of this motley communist group should call him on his mobile, which is hosted by that great capitalist company Telecom. &quot;Either that or visit his site on the capitalist-created Internet,&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>
