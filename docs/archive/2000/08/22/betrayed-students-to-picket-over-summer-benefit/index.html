<p><strong>Tuesday, 22 August 2000, 2:19 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Betrayed Students To Picket Prime Minister Over Summer Benefit</p>
<p>Student and activist groups in three cities are to protest over a recent<br>decision by the Labour and Alliance parties to vote down a private members<br>bill that would have granted all students access to the Emergency<br>Unemployment Benefit over summer.</p>
<p>In an unprecedented move, students will picket the Prime Minister Helen<br>Clark as she delivers a lecture in Auckland today, at the Maidment Theatre<br>at 12:30. This Friday Waikato students will hold an &quot;SOS - Summer of<br>Starvation&quot; protest with a soup kitchen in Garden Place. A further action<br>is being planned in Dunedin for early next week.</p>
<p>In 1998 the National party restricted access to the Emergency Unemployment<br>Benefit to only those students who were eligible to receive an allowance<br>during the academic term time. This resulted in foodbanks being set up at<br>a number of student associations.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to send a clear message to the Prime Minister that this issue<br>will not go away, it is not acceptable for the government to deny students<br>a safety net that all other groups in society have.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Students are outraged at the complete turnaround from two parties who<br>were so strongly opposed to National&#39;s decision in 1998. Many students<br>voted for Labour and the Alliance so that they would deliver a fairer<br>system of tertiary fees, loans and allowances, and are now feeling<br>betrayed,&quot; said Sam Huggard, NZUSA Co President.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be keeping up the pressure on the government on this issue.<br>Students will not accept Labour&#39;s flimsy excuses that the Emergency<br>Unemployment Benefit is unaffordable&quot;, said Sam Huggard.</p>
