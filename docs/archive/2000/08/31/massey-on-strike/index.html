<p>Massey on Strike</p>
<p>Both general and academic staff at Massey University are striking on Friday 1 September. Last minute informal talks between management and representatives of the combined unions this morning clarified issues between the two groups but drew them no closer to an agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;Our staff are deeply angered by management&#39;s attempts to clawback certain conditions in the recently expired collective contract, such as our retirement clauses and our ability to include department heads in our collective,&quot; said joint union industrial campaign speaker Dr Karen Rhodes.</p>
<p>It does not help us reach agreement when our members hear the management touting claims about the great deal they have offered us. Much of their &#39;offer&#39; means relatively little to our members, while our real concerns – like the clawbacks – are ignored or denied,&quot; said Dr Rhodes.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very concerned about our rising workloads, for instance, and with the threat of redundancies looming, those of us left will face even heavier burdens. A working party composed of management and union representatives to establish workload guidelines was a provision of the contract we ratified two years ago. Those guidelines were finalised only yesterday. We still have no guarantee that they will be acceptable to the Vice-Chancellor, however. He has failed for a year to act on a similar document from a similar working party on academic promotions,&quot; said Dr Rhodes.</p>

<p>Friday&#39;s strike action affects Massey&#39;s three main campuses in Palmerston North, Albany and Wellington. Staff will be picketing campus entrances at various times throughout the morning. &quot;We expect orderly and responsible pamphletting of all people wishing to enter campus, with organisers and safety officers at all locales,&quot; said Dr Rhodes.</p>
