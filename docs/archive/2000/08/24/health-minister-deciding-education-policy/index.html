<p><strong>Thursday, 24 August 2000, 11:11 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>The ‘golden handcuffs’ policy that will allow Health Funding Authorities to give junior doctors a lump sum payment at the end of each year worked could prove to be very troublesome , said ACT Tertiary Education spokesman Stephen Franks.</p>
<p>Last week it was revealed that the Government was debating discounting junior doctors student loans. Today’s statement was also aimed at junior doctors who are currently on strike.</p>
<p>“The Government is in talk back politics. The proposed policy may have merit but the means by which we have arrived at it is bizarre.</p>
<p>“Initially I thought Annette King may have been thinking with her mouth open without realising the effects. She could be forgiven for grasping at quick fix solutions for a Health portfolio crisis, but it now seems Cabinet is allowing her to set policy off the cuff.</p>
<p>“The student loan policy does need revisiting. However, the singling out of one small group for special treatment is neither sensible, equitable or fair.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders need immediate reassurance that the repercussions of the currently proposed policy have been thought through?</p>
<p> Will doctors who are already paying, or have completed paying off loans, be reimbursed?</p>
<p> How will the Government meet ‘me too’ claims from nurses, science teachers and others with scarce and valuable skills.</p>
<p> Won’t doctors still take off overseas for higher pay after their loans are wiped?</p>
<p> Will this new policy create increased demand for student loans, like the Government’s ‘loan for free’ policy that will see loans skyrocket to $6 billion by 2002, nearly twice as quick as forecast before Labour’s policy</p>
<p> Why will the policy apply only to junior hospital doctors, when young medical graduates who work elsewhere are equally in debt?</p>
<p> Won’t qualified people set out to postpone repayment until the coalition Government sorts out when its ‘forgiveness policy’ might start</p>
<p> Has the Minister of Finance calculated the billions knocked off Government assets if student loans become irrecoverable.</p>
<p>“This should not have been discussed until the details were sorted out. While the proposal itself may be a good one, developing policy through ‘talk back’ is not an indication of a stable Government,” said Stephen Franks.<br>ENDS  </p>
