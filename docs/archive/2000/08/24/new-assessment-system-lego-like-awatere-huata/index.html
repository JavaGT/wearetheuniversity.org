<p>New Assessment System “Lego-Like” – Awatere Huata</p>
<p>ACT Education Spokesperson, Donna Awatere Huata, has likened the changes to New Zealand’s senior school exams to a badly constructed Lego set</p>
<p>“The pieces just don’t fit,” she said.</p>
<p>The new National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCA) will mean school certificate, sixth form certificate and bursary will be dropped.</p>
<p>“The changes have been likened to a dumbing-down our education standards – well let me tell you, that is an understatement.</p>
<p>“Making up something from lots of little bits may work well for a good Lego set, but it will not work for qualifications..</p>
<p>“Too many pieces are going to be missing. In particular the ones who require qualitative judgements that test ability, that are more subtle, creative, imaginative or simply more demanding.”</p>
<p>Mrs Huata said the proposed new exam system would be costly to administer and reduce teachers to “high-stakes check-list assessors,” rather than professionals using their judgement to advance the prospects of students.</p>
<p>“The NCEA will lack public credibility, provide an enormous workload for teachers, and even worse, will leave prospective employers without an identifiable benchmark to rate employment candidates.</p>
<p>“In short, it will be totally useless,” said Mrs Huata.</p>
<p>Mrs Huata said she was a firm supporter of reviewing and improving school qualifications but the NCA was not the way to do it.</p>
<p>“The best to do is consign the NCA to the rubbish bin and start again,” Mrs Huata said.</p>
