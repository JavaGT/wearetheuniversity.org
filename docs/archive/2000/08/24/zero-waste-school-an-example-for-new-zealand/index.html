<p>24 August 2000<br>Zero waste school an example for New Zealand</p>
<p>Kaikoura electorate-based Green Party MP Ian Ewen-Street today offered his congratulations to Kaikoura High School on their adoption of a zero waste strategy for the school.</p>
<p>Kaikoura High is the first school to adopt a zero waste strategy in New Zealand. They will recycle food waste in compost, and have recycle bins for cans, paper and other reusable materials.</p>
<p>&quot;I am absolutely delighted that Kaikoura High are picking up the torch of sustainability and running with it,&quot; said Mr Ewen-Street.</p>
<p>&quot;As a core party policy the Greens are committed to an overall goal of a zero waste in New Zealand and we are delighted that Kaikoura, and the young people in the area, are setting the example.&quot;</p>
<p>Kaikoura has a goal of zero waste in landfill by 2015.</p>
<p>&quot;The entire Green Party extend their congratulations to the students and staff at Kaikoura High. It is forward thinking like this upon which this nation - and eventually the world - will soon come to depend. I hope other schools, businesses and households take a leaf out of their book,&quot; he said.</p>
