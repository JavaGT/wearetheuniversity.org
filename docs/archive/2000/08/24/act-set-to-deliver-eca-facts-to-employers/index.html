<p><strong>Thursday, 24 August 2000, 4:50 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT is beginning in Otago tomorrow, a nation-wide series of seminars on the Employment Relations Act, said ACT Leader Hon Richard Prebble.</p>
<p>The seminar will be held at Cargills Restaurant, George street, Dunedin at 12pm. This will be the first of more than 20 seminars on the Act.</p>
<p>The ACT party will be pointing out the numerous loopholes in the new union promoting law. ACT will be posting a copy of the seminar handout on the ACT website. <a href="http://www.act.org.nz/action/employment/loopholes.htm">http://www.act.org.nz/action/employment/loopholes.htm</a></p>
<p>“ACT believes it has identified at least 25 loopholes and will be sharing these with concerned employers and employees around New Zealand. The loopholes include:</p>
<p> Through bad drafting it appears trade unions have no right to represent employees seeking an individual contract.</p>
<p> Strike prone companies should consider employing all staff in a service company that then contracts to the firm.</p>
<p> Employers can seek to have individual contracts set aside on the basis that they were not given independent advice.</p>
<p> Employers and their employees can before October 2 form in-house unions.</p>
<p> It is arguable that a union member can only be employed after a collective agreement has been agreed with the union.</p>
<p>“It is clear in the Act that wild cat strikes, threats and intimidation are illegal and that offenders can be subject to a compliance order and/or a large fine.</p>
<p>“ACT is advising employees not to hesitate to take unions, union officials and employees to the Authority when they do not act in good faith,” said Hon Richard Prebble.</p>
