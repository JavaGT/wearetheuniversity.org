<p><strong>Thursday, 24 August 2000, 11:13 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT NZ is consulting lawyers with a view to seeking a judicial review of the Royal Commission on Genetic Modified Organisms decision to exclude ACT from ‘interested party’ status, said ACT Agriculture spokesman and Central Otago farmer, Gerry Eckhoff.</p>
<p>“The Royal Commission’s decision to reject ACT’s bid lacks any degree of even handedness.</p>
<p>“A third of the ACT party caucus represents rural people, a figure far higher than any other party can boast. ACT has, and always will, have a clear focus on land based industry and its importance to New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Bio-technology research has enabled New Zealand to be world leaders in the agricultural industry. Thus it is obvious that any decision made by the Commission will impact heavily on rural New Zealand and its future.</p>
<p>“The Green party’s assertion that they are committed to green philosophies, and that politics are not their primary focus, is asinine.</p>
<p>“ACT could equally claim that our philosophy compels us to put New Zealand into the top ten per cent of countries world-wide, but to achieve such a goal requires a political dimension.</p>
<p>“ACT’s desire is for all of humanity to benefit from scientific progress, and if resorting to legal action is the only way to achieve this end, then ACT will vigorously pursue this action,” said Gerry Eckhoff.</p>
