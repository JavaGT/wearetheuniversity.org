<p><strong>Wednesday, 23 August 2000, 2:24 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Greens Push For Less On Defence, More On Social Services</p>
<p>The Greens will be pushing the Government to spend less money on warplanes and spying and more on social services during the budget estimates debate in Parliament this afternoon.</p>
<p>The Green Party will put up amendments to take $40 million out of projects in the defence and security budget and reallocate this &quot;peace dividend&quot; into social services, such as providing the emergency unemployment benefit for students over the summer.</p>
<p>Under the Green amendments, funding for the Skyhawks, the Waihopai spy base and the Security Intelligence Service (SIS) would be cut, as a first step towards phasing out all three.</p>
<p>&quot;Continuing to waste taxpayer funds on these projects is perpetuating the archaic Cold War mentality,&quot; said Mr Donald. &quot;Our proposals are fiscally prudent - reprioritising and spending the savings wisely.&quot;</p>
<p>The Green amendments would cut:<br>* $25 million from the air combat (Skyhawks) force<br>* $10 million from the Government Communication Security Bureau (Waihopai spybase)<br>* $5 million from the SIS</p>
<p>The money would be reallocated to:<br>* $17 million for the emergency unemployment benefit for students over the summer<br>* $5 million for improving nutrition education and monitoring for illegal GE ingredients in food<br>* further proposals to be announced when the budget debate resumes after recess</p>
<p>Mr Donald accepted the Government would probably veto the amendments but described them as &quot;symbolic with meaning&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;We want to make the very strong point that the Government could deliver on social and environmental priorities by cutting wasteful expenditure elsewhere.&quot;</p>
<p>On top of the peace dividend amendments, the Greens are also hoping to convince the Government to increase its commitment to &#39;Buy NZ Made&quot;, by doubling the capacity of the Industrial Supplies Office.</p>
<p>&quot;We are proposing that $450,000 be moved from a $33 million grants fund into the Industrial Supplies Office, so that the office can help deliver on the Government&#39;s job creation and regional development objectives.&quot;</p>
