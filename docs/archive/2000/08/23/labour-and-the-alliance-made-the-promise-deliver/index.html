<p>Media Release</p>
<p>22 August 2000</p>
<p>LABOUR AND THE ALLIANCE MADE THE PROMISE - NOW DELIVER!</p>
<p>“Labour and Alliance MPs and candidates were full of promises to the health profession about significant wage increases just before the election,” said New Zealand First Deputy Leader, Peter Brown.</p>
<p>‘Now they occupy the Treasury benches, they should try to deliver on these promises by addressing the pay and retention concerns of the junior doctors.</p>
<p>“So far the Government has not truly identified the problem. Our junior doctors are saddled with high student debt repayments; their salaries compare unfavourably with those paid overseas – particularly those paid in Australia; and their hours of work are long and demanding.</p>
<p>“On the other hand, Australia has reduced the hours of work for its junior doctors which has created a demand for more of them.</p>
<p>“My challenge to the Government is do something and honour its pre-election promises to avoid further industrial action and the potential risks to patients.</p>
<p>“The junior doctors are entitled to better consideration than they are receiving and so is the public. An efficient and effective health system is essential and the Government should not forget that,” concluded Peter Brown.</p>
