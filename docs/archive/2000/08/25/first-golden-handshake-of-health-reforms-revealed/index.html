<p><strong>Friday, 25 August 2000, 9:31 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The first massive golden handshake of Annette King&#39;s health reforms has been revealed - with the former Healthlink South boss being paid out $265,000 for quitting her job, National Health spokesperson Wyatt Creech said today.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a huge pay-out and can only be blamed on the Health Minister and her health reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;Healthlink South boss Jane Parfitt got the payout because her board was being merged with the Canterbury Health Board to form one District Health Board under the Government&#39;s health reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;Annette King promised in February there would be no golden handshakes from her health reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;She must front up and explain why this has happened, and how many more golden handshakes are in the wind as people lose their jobs in the widespread health restructuring.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government railed long and hard against golden handshakes when they were in Opposition.</p>
<p>&quot;This payout is much bigger than those they were yelling from the rooftops against.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#39;s worse is that this is in the health sector, at a time when all people want is for health professionals to get on with the job of delivering health services.</p>
<p>&quot;People are sick of golden handshakes. They are also sick of health restructuring.</p>
<p>&quot;Annette King needs to start listening to the concerns about the health reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead she&#39;s ploughing on imposing more costs, payouts and upheaval.&quot;</p>
