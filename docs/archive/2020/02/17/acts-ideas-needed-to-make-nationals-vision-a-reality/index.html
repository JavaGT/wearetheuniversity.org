<p><strong>Monday, 17 February 2020, 3:47 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“National’s economic vision is long on aspiration, but it will require ACT’s ideas in order to bring it to life”, according to ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“Simon Bridges today outlined a number of economic goals a future centre-right government would work towards.</p>
<p>“Higher economic growth, better wages and more jobs are absolutely essential for higher living standards, so we can afford better education, healthcare and public services.</p>
<p>“How we get there is another matter.</p>
<p>“ACT this morning outlined a checklist according to which any economic reform agenda should be judged, including:</p>
<p>• A flat rate of tax on individual and company income of 17.5%</p>
<p>• Ending wasteful spending like corporate and middle-class welfare</p>
<p>• Replacing the Resource Management Act so the private sector can build new houses and be more productive</p>
<p>• A Regulatory Responsibility Bill to raise the standard of lawmaking</p>
<p>• Raising the age of superannuation to reduce the cost – estimated at $58 billion by 2037</p>
<p>• Improving investment in human capital through charter schools and student education accounts</p>
<p>• Lifting restrictions on overseas investment</p>
<p>• Streamlining the immigration system so we can attract highly-skilled people.</p>
<p>“Our underlying economic problem is productivity. New Zealand’s economy is very busy, it’s just not very productive. In fact, we are in the lower-left corner. Poor productivity twenty years ago, and low growth since. When we talk about poverty, it is really just low productivity. The government needs an all-out productivity drive, reducing government waste, taxes, and excessive regulations.</p>
<p>“When it comes to the economy and higher living standards, National has the right vision – but it will need ACT’s ideas to make it happen.”</p>
