<p>New research* highlights how the lack of success in controlling weeds on agricultural and conservation land is challenging New Zealand’s position as a global leader in biosecurity.</p>
<p>This is despite weeds costing New Zealand billions of dollars every year.</p>
<p>In a state-of-the-art review of how weeds are managed in New Zealand, Professor Philip Hulme of the Bio-Protection Research Centre, based at Lincoln University, has called for a paradigm shift in our approach.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, we have rather little to show for the vast amount of time and effort government and landowners invest in the management of weeds,” Professor Hulme said.</p>
<p>He said part of the problem is the reliance on short-term, underfunded, and poorly coordinated control programmes that usually only target the weed in question and not the underlying causes of the problem as well.</p>
<p>“Weeds may often be the passengers of wider ecosystem degradation rather than the drivers of change, so working to restore the system rather than only removing the weed may be a more sustainable approach”.</p>
<p>He also points to a worrying trend that spending on weed management and research is no longer a priority.</p>
<p>“Investment in major biosecurity initiatives such as Predator-Free NZ, kauri dieback and myrtle rust has led to fewer resources for weed eradication”.</p>
<p>This may explain why the Department of Conservation is managing weeds on a smaller area than it was five years ago, he said.</p>
<p>In addition to calling for a more holistic approach to biosecurity management, Professor Hulme recommends a shift from weed control being a reactive response to reflecting a proactive strategy.</p>

<p>“We should really be looking at stopping the weeds of the future, particularly those that will become a problem under climate change but also those that, given enough time, are likely to spread anyway.”</p>
