<p><strong>Monday, 10 February 2020, 11:48 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology">Auckland University of Technology</a></strong></p>
<p>Associate Professor Ella Henry (Ngātikahu ki Whangaroa, Ngāti Kuri, Te Rārawa), an academic renowned for her research into and advocacy of Māori culture, language and leadership, has taken up a new role at AUT’s Business School.</p>
<p>As the inaugural Director of Māori Advancement, Associate Professor Henry will guide the understanding and implementation of biculturalism in the Business School’s curriculum, research and engagement and partnerships. She will work alongside Associate Professor Khylee Quince, who holds a similar role in AUT’s Law School.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Henry has been part of the AUT whānau since 2008, when she joined as a part-time lecturer in Māori Development and Māori Media. For the past 11 years, she has conducted her teaching and research in Te Ara Poutama, the Faculty of Māori and Indigenous Development. Her research interests and expertise span Māori development, Māori entrepreneurship, Māori careers, Māori media and screen production. Associate Professor Henry, who will join the Department of Management, says she is excited to take up the three-year secondment to assist the Business School on its journey.</p>
<p>“I see this role as a chance to enhance opportunities for Māori academic and professional staff. I’m looking forward to getting to know the Māori community here and to explore their aspirations for support and development.”</p>
<p>The Associate Professor has already identified a number of priorities including: to work with all members of the School who want to increase their knowledge and understanding of mātauranga Māori; to determine how best to embed mātauranga Māori into the School’s academic programmes; and to facilitate and broker relationships between the Māori business community and the Business School.</p>

<p>Professor Kate Kearins is Dean and Pro Vice-Chancellor of the Faculty of Business, Economics and Law. She says it is a privilege to welcome Associate Professor Henry to the School and to take her lead in developing a roadmap for the journey towards biculturalism.</p>
<p>“The Director of Māori Advancement is an important role and we are proud to have two dedicated positions within our faculty. Associate Professor Henry is a highly respected wahine toa who is a valued contributor to both the Māori community and to academic circles. She will be an asset to the Business School and we look forward to sharing her talents, strengths and expertise with our colleagues and students.”</p>
