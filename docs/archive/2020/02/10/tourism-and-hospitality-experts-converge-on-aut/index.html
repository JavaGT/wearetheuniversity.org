<p><strong>Monday, 10 February 2020, 7:17 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology">Auckland University of Technology</a></strong></p>
<p>Hundreds of international experts in tourism, hospitality and events are meeting in Auckland.</p>
<p>More than 280 academics are at the Auckland University of Technology for the 30th conference of the Council for Australasian Tourism and Hospitality Education (CAUTHE) from February 10-13.</p>
<p>It is only the third time the annual conference has been held in New Zealand, and the first time in Auckland.</p>
<p>CAUTHE 2020 is also the largest so far, with more papers set to be published out of it than in previous years.</p>
<p>&quot;We have an enormous amount of pride in hosting this conference, particularly in AUT&#39;s 20th year,” co-organiser Dr Tracy Harkison says.</p>
<p>“It&#39;s great to showcase the strength that we have in the fields of hospitality, tourism, events and culinary arts at our university.&quot;</p>
<p>The theme for this year’s conference is <em>20:20 Vision: New Perspectives on the diversity of Hospitality, Tourism and Events.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Hospitality is very diverse at the best of times, in terms of culture, religion, ethnicity, and countries - even when looking simply just at East and West or at how we celebrate,” Dr Harkison says.</p>
<p>“The world is a global village and it&#39;s great to see what other people are doing; to look at the shared successes as well as the issues that everyone is facing.”</p>
