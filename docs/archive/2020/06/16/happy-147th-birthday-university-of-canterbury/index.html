<p><strong>Tuesday, 16 June 2020, 7:51 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>The founders of the University of Canterbury 147 years ago were progressive, but could never have imagined the diverse, multi-cultural, gender-balanced leadership of today’s university. UC is the first, and remains the only, Aotearoa New Zealand university to be led by four women; in the Vice-Chancellor, Chancellor, student association President and Vice-President roles.</p>
<p>Since the inaugural address at the founding of the Canterbury Collegiate Union in 1872, this university has stood for accessible higher education, service to community, and the encouragement of talent without barriers of distance, wealth, class, gender or ethnicity.</p>
<p>Henry John Tancred was the first Chancellor of the University of New Zealand (as University of Canterbury was first known). In his inaugural address launching the Canterbury Collegiate Union he propounded his view that the new college should be entirely inclusive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is of the greatest importance to the well-being of the whole that this influence should be felt in every part and among all classes, that high as well as low, rich as well as poor, should have every opportunity afforded to them of cultivating and developing the higher faculties in such a manner as will fit them for occupying worthily the highest position in the State.” – Henry John Tancred (1872)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More recently Ūpoko o Ngāi Tūāhuriri, Dr Te Maire Tau said he was pleased UC will be moving on a range of tribal initiatives this year.</p>

<p>“Ngāi Tahu appreciates the core values that underpin the University of Canterbury and the teaching of open contestable knowledge,” Dr Tau said.</p>
<p>“Knowledge, its creation, production and distribution within an open society that has learnt to be tolerant and appreciative of difference is why Ngāi Tahu supports this University.”</p>
<p>In 2023, UC will mark its 150th anniversary as an opportunity to celebrate past achievements and set a course that looks ahead to its second centenary – Tangata Tū, Tangata Ora | Engaged, empowered, making a difference.</p>
<p>The University continues to stand for these principles and explicitly aims to produce graduates who are engaged with their communities, empowered to act for good and determined to make a difference in the world.</p>
<p>UC supports academic staff taking the role of critic and conscience of society and an active role in shaping Aotearoa New Zealand society.</p>
<p>The University has adapted and changed to meet external challenges for nearly 150 years, but also holds true to the principles upon which it was founded. This university was formed first as the Canterbury Collegiate Union in 1872, and became the Canterbury College in 1873, the first constituent college of the University of New Zealand. It was the second institution in New Zealand to provide tertiary-level education, and the fourth in Australasia. In 1961, the federated University of New Zealand was split and the University of Canterbury was created as an independent university.</p>
