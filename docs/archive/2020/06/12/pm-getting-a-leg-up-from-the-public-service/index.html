<p><strong>Friday, 12 June 2020, 4:12 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National Party campaign chair Gerry Brownlee says taxpayers deserve a good answer to why the Instagram page for the Unite for Recovery website they’re paying for – and which is staffed by public servants expected to be neutral – is following just one Instagram page, the personal account of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.</p>
<p>“Why is the newly re-branded Unite for Recovery Instagram page run by the neutral National Crisis Management Centre effectively promoting Jacinda Ardern’s campaign Instagram page?” Mr Brownlee asks.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders visit this site to get official Government news and resources on responding to the virus.</p>
<p>“Once there users are encouraged to get the latest updates on the response via the site’s Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram feeds.</p>
<p>“When you visit an Instagram page you see at the top the number of posts, followers and which accounts, if any, the page host is following.</p>
<p>“In the case of the Unite for Recovery page that is presently 239 posts, 41,900 followers and the account itself is following just one other account.</p>
<p>“You can’t see whose the account is, but if you’re curious and click on it you’re taken to Jacinda Ardern’s personal Instagram feed.</p>
<p>“How many New Zealanders have visited Unite for Recovery in the past week and clicked through to the Prime Minister’s social media?</p>
<p>“How many have started following her as a result thanks to this monopoly, taxpayer-aided position, 99 days out from an election?</p>

<p>“And when did Jacinda Ardern learn that she was the recipient of this potential new channel of social media followers?</p>
<p>“Why didn’t she say it was inappropriate and have the Unite for Recovery account stop following her?</p>
<p>“I have written to the State Services Commissioner this afternoon to ask how this occurred and what he intends to do about it.</p>
<p>“One way or another it’s clear Labour is already tilting the playing field to its advantage using taxpayer resources – and it’s far from the first time it’s done this sort of thing during an election campaign.”</p>
