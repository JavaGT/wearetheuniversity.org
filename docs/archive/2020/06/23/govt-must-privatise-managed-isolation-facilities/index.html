<p><strong>Tuesday, 23 June 2020, 8:12 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“The Government must allow the private sector to operate managed isolation facilities as a means of expanding capacity and improving accountability,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“The role of government should be to set the rules and enforce them, not to be a player on the field.</p>
<p>“Right now, we have government-run managed isolation being done incompetently and with limited capacity.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, only friends of the government are getting exemptions to the rules.</p>
<p>“Universities, schools, and horticultural and other businesses are willing and able to house students and workers for 14 days of managed isolation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All that is required is for government to establish a licensing system for privately-managed isolation facilities. WorkSafe would enforce the rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“A Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking under the Health and Safety at Work Act faces far more accountability for breaches than is the case under the current system.</p>
<p>“This change would expand New Zealand’s capacity to accept overseas students and workers, allowing the economy to get moving again.</p>
<p>“Travellers who have Covid-19 or Covid-19 symptoms would still be required to enter a government quarantine facility.</p>
<p>“The Government needs to be clear with New Zealanders: Is the goal total eradication of Covid-19, or resilience in a post-Covid-19 world? If the latter, it needs to be more nimble in opening up the economy.”</p>
