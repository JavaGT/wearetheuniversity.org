<p><strong>Saturday, 20 June 2020, 5:04 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Today National has selected two new Auckland candidates with Agnes Loheni in Māngere and Nuwanthie Samarakone in Manurewa.</p>
<p>Ms Loheni has been a National MP since early 2019 and is also an accomplished business woman in the manufacturing export and retail sector as an owner of the Pacific fashion brand called MENA. Ms Samarakone was born in Sri Lanka and is currently the founding CEO of ICE (Inspire, Create, Engage), an early-in-careers people consultancy firm.</p>
<p>“Māngere is a vibrant and diverse community with families and businesses working hard to get ahead,” Ms Loheni says.</p>
<p>“National has the experience and know how to put jobs back into our economy and support Māngere.</p>
<p>“Our community needs a National Government to guide us out of this economic crisis. National understands business and it is businesses that will create jobs for New Zealanders, not Wellington.</p>
<p>“I will be working hard to ensure we see a National Government this September because we cannot afford another Labour Government, definitely not in these uncertain times,” Ms Loheni says.</p>
<p>Ms Samarakone is excited to be selected as National’s candidate in Manurewa and is looking forward to hitting the campaign trail.</p>
<p>“The current Government has talked big, promised even more, but has failed to deliver even in the good times. It’s one thing to make lofty promises, but Manurewa deserves to have a Government it can rely on,” Ms Samarakone says</p>
<p>“We’ve seen failure after failure from the Government, whether it’s KiwiBuild or Light Rail, or more recently, keeping our borders tight with strict quarantining. National can be counted on to deliver.</p>

<p>“I’ll be fighting to ensure Manurewa has strong, local, National Party representation,” Ms Samarakone says.</p>
