<p><strong>Tuesday, 9 June 2020, 8:38 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Government needs to release the Health and Disability sector review which was completed months ago, National’s Health spokesperson Michael Woodhouse says.</p>
<p>The wide-ranging review, chaired by Heather Simpson, was completed by its 30 March deadline, yet Health Minister David Clark has not confirmed receipt let alone released it.</p>
<p>“Covid-19 will have a serious impact on the health and disability sector. David Clark needs to confirm he has received the report and release it as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>“Understandably, the New Zealand Medical Association, General Practice New Zealand and New Zealand College of Midwives have all been calling for the release of the report.</p>
<p>“It is unacceptable that it was completed more than two months ago and we are still waiting to hear the findings.</p>
<p>“This is another example of the Government completely failing to live up to their promise to be open and transparent.”</p>
