<p><strong>Monday, 1 June 2020, 5:11 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“Scenes of thousands of protesters shoulder to shoulder makes a mockery of the Government&#39;s COVID-19 restrictions and insults every New Zealander who&#39;s followed them,&quot; according to ACT Leader David Seymour</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is not committed to justice or science in fighting COVID but a toxic combination of favouritism and fear. Film crews and Black Lives Matter Protestors get a pass, leaving job losses and misery for the working class.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be people who&#39;ve lost their jobs, lost their businesses, in some cases even lost their homes under COVID-19 restrictions. There are people trapped overseas and separated from their families while the &#39;lucky&#39; ones spend 14 days all but incarcerated in hotel rooms. These are the law-abiding New Zealanders playing their part in the &#39;team of five million&#39;s&#39; effort to beat COVID-19. Tonight they&#39;ll see thousands of people shoulder-to-shoulder protesting something that happened 12,000 km away and, thankfully, has no parallel in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;Adding to the insult is the Government&#39;s response. Predictably, the Government will keep imposing ruinous restrictions on law abiding New Zealanders while turning a blind eye to what should be considered a major public health risk if we took the Prime Minister&#39;s utterances seriously.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT has been first many times to oppose racism, support freedom of expression and oppose abuse of police power. As the Herald reported, I did this as recently as Wednesday when the Police came to the Finance and Expenditure Committee.</p>
<p>&quot;However, we also believe in the rule of law, applied equally to all New Zealanders. Today&#39;s events have made a mockery of the Government and it must move quickly to Level 1 tomorrow.</p>
