<p><strong>Monday, 1 June 2020, 11:56 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“While the Government continues to restrict the size of social gatherings to 100, today’s protesters must play by same rules as the rest of us,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“ACT believes New Zealand should be at Level 1 now, restrictions on the size of social gatherings should be lifted, and peaceful protests over George Floyd’s death should be allowed to proceed today.</p>
<p>“However, if the Government intends to keep New Zealand at Level 2, the rules should be enforced at today’s protests.</p>
<p>“The Level 2 rules say social gatherings that exceed 100 people are prohibited.</p>
<p>“There should be no exception for particular causes.</p>
<p>“Organisations of every kind are facing restrictions, including political parties in election year. Before the lockdown, it was not unusual to see more than 100 people at a political event. Now, that’s not allowed and can’t be planned.</p>
<p>“As long as we remain at Level 2, we all need to play by the same rules.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders have made enormous sacrifices to beat Covid-19. Business owners have lost livelihoods and tens of thousands workers have lost jobs. New Zealanders have accepted unprecedented restrictions on their civil liberties.</p>
<p>“It would be unacceptable for the authorities to make an exception to the rules for a particular cause.</p>
<p>“If Covid-19 remains a threat, the Government should enforce the rules at today’s protests. If it is no longer a threat, the Government should remove the remaining restrictions.”</p>
