<p><strong>Thursday, 18 June 2020, 2:32 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Corrections Minister Kelvin Davis should apologise to victims of crime after his Department chose to reduce community service sentences imposed by the Court on parolees during the Covid-19 lockdown, National’s Corrections spokesperson Simeon Brown says.</p>
<p>“During the lockdown Correction probation officers had two options under the Epidemic Preparedness Notice when dealing with parolees and their community service sentences.</p>
<p>“One was to extend the amount of time the parolee had to complete their community service, the other was to wipe off hours and reduce the sentence.</p>
<p>“Not a single hour of community service was delayed as a result of the pandemic, instead probation officers chose to simply wipe off 130,000 hours of community service.</p>
<p>“It was clear something had to happen as parolees were unable to complete community service hours during lockdown, but simply wiping those hours sends a terrible message to victims of crime. The parolees should have had their community service delayed rather than wiped. If you commit a crime you should face the consequences.</p>
<p>“More than 11,000 offenders were eligible to have their sentences reduced or delayed. It seems everyone in our team of 5 million played their part during lockdown, but for some it meant more freedom than less.</p>
<p>“Kelvin Davis needs to justify why it was necessary for offenders, who have been ordered to give back through community service, can simply receive a lighter sentence due to Covid-19. That’s not fair on their victims.”</p>
