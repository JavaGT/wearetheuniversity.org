<p><strong>Thursday, 12 November 2020, 11:51 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato">University of Waikato</a></strong></p>
<p>Does the dreaded Didymo bloom because of climate change, new environments or a genetic variant?</p>
<p>The University of Waikato’s Dr Alexis Marshall will investigate these questions thanks to a 2020 Rutherford Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship from Royal Society Te Apārangi.</p>
<p>Didymo, more commonly known as Rock Snot, produces nuisance growths in freshwater rivers and streams around the globe.</p>
<p>“Historically, Didymo was an inconspicuous background organism found in nutrient-poor Northern Hemisphere rivers. Today, Didymo is considered a globally invasive species, capable of blooming at an unprecedented scale under conditions that would restrict the growth of other species,” says Dr Marshall.</p>
<p>Using a genomic approach, Dr Marshall will identify and characterise the genetic architecture of blooming and non-blooming Didymo collected across its global distribution.</p>
<p>Dr Marshall has already succeeded in assembling a world first draft Didymo reference genome, which will help determine if Didymo blooms occur as the result of adaptation to climate change, a response to introduction to new environments, or the result of an acquired genetic variant.</p>
<p>Professor Bryony James, Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research, says: “Dr Marshall’s work contributes to the freshwater expertise at the University of Waikato, and this Fellowship will help provide insights into a significant environmental challenge facing New Zealand that is still largely understood.”</p>
<p>Rutherford Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowships are awarded to outstanding early-career researchers who demonstrate a passion for research, and have a strong sense of the purpose and benefits of research to Aotearoa.</p>
<p>They contribute to supporting recipients to undertake full-time research programmes for two years within New Zealand in any area of research, science and technology, including social sciences and the humanities.</p>
