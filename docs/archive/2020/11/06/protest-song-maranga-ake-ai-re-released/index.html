<p>Father and daughter team Baz and Shaye Muir are the force behind NLC, which is re-releasingMaranga Ake Ai.</p>
<p>A 1980s Māori protest song used to revitalise the 2020 Māori Party movement will be re-released –35 years after its initial release.</p>
<p>Maranga Ake Ai was released in 1985 by pioneer Māori reggae band Aotearoa. That track features now Supreme Court Judge Justice Sir Joe Williams on vocals, who also co-wrote the song.</p>
<p>Māori Party Tamaki Makaurau candidate John Tamihere – who was at Auckland University during the Māori renascence of the 1980s – knew the lyrics would strike a chord with Māori today and approached Sir Joe’s representatives for permission to use the track to galvanise the new Māori Party movement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Māori have always gravitated to reggae music and Sir Joe’s lyrics are as relevant today as they were when he penned this in the 1980s. Sir Joe was among a new wave young educated Māori behind our cultural revival,” Tamihere said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Thankfully Sir Joe’s people were gracious enough to allow the Māori Party to re-record the track and use it as part of our 2020 election campaign.”</p>
<p>The job of refreshing the much-loved waiata for the Māori Party was given to Whanganui musician Baz Muir who heads the reggae band, NLC.</p>
<p>“I was over the moon when I was asked to re-record and reproduce it,” Muir said.</p>

<p>“It was really a big honour because it’s such a well-known song and I remember my parents, who were also musicians, playing it live back in the day.”</p>
<p>Muir spent a lot of time listening to the original recording before adding the “NLC” flavour to it.</p>
<p>“We worked on it in our studio in Whanganui for about a month, listening to the original track numerous times, making sure we can get that same sort of feel,” he said.</p>
<p>“It was such an enjoyable project to work on.”</p>
<p>Muir was lead vocals on the song and had help from NLC band members including his multi-talented daughter Shaye Muir (keyboards, vocals) and Marcel Martin (guitarist, vocals).</p>
<p>“We know this song is about people standing up for their rights, speaking out for Māori people.</p>
<p>Muir said people had approached him asking to buy a copy of the song. That happens today (November 6, 2020) when the song is officially released – again.</p>
<p>“We worked on the song, getting its sound right, and it was mastered by Chris Chetland at Kog Studios near Auckland.”</p>
<p>A video was also released for the waiata.</p>
<p>NLC won the Best Roots-Reggae title at the 2019 National Waiata Māori Music Awards and is now working under the Waatea Music label.</p>
<p>The band released its fifth album in July 2020 and is working on a collection of about six te reo Māori songs for a new EP in the near future.</p>
