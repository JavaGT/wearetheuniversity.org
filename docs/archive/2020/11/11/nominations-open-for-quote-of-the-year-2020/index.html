<p><strong>Wednesday, 11 November 2020, 1:20 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University">Massey University</a></strong></p>
<p>The quest is on for the best New Zealand quotes of 2020, and Massey University is calling on the public to help find them.</p>
<p>Massey University’s School of Communications, Journalism and Marketing Senior Lecturer Dr Heather Kavan has been running the competition since creating it in 2011. She says from elections to lockdowns, there have been plenty of life-altering events to give rise to memorable one-liners this year.</p>
<p>“If there’s a phrase or sentence that stayed in your mind throughout the year, we’d love to hear from you.”</p>
<p>People have already been making suggestions, including ringing phrases from the lockdown, like “team of five million” and “we go early, we go hard”.</p>
<p>Other suggested quotes are more individualistic. National Party leader Judith Collins&#39;, “When my eyebrow goes up, it’s a joke,” and New Zealand First MP Shane Jones’, “I consumed about a gallon of red wine last night” are favourites, she says.</p>
<p>Since the competition began in 2011, the public have drawn on diverse sources to find the quotes.</p>
<p>“We’ve received quotes from speeches, news interviews, social media, stand-up comedy, advertisements, television, and movies.”</p>
<p>All types of quotes are welcome. “The words can be rousing, tragic, beautiful, controversial, hilarious, unexpected, or even embarrassing.”</p>
<p>Given the rising use of social media during the lockdown, written quotes are likely to be popular too, she says.</p>
<p>“I’m especially keen to hear from Twitter users who have spotted entertaining tweets. From memory, there were amusing tweets on the marijuana referendum (or ‘reefer-endum’).&quot;</p>
<h2>How will the quotes be judged?</h2>

<p>The competition calls on the public for nominations, then the university’s judging panel will then select the top ten before the public can vote on which one they think is the winner.</p>
<p>Dr Kavan says that voters often prefer different quotes to the ones experts choose. “We tend to look for variety because some voters like deep and meaningful quotes, while others scan the list for the funniest quote.</p>
<p>“A really good quote is usually one that people like, irrespective of whether they agree with the speaker’s viewpoint.</p>
<p>“Unscripted quotes usually do well, especially blunders. Speakers can spend years honing their command of language only to find that people prefer their mistakes to their eloquence,” she says.</p>
<h2>How to nominate</h2>
<p>First, check that the quote was said or written by a New Zealander or a person living in New Zealand this year and then anyone can nominate the quote.</p>
<p>People can nominate more than one quote.</p>
<p>Nominations close at midnight on November 30. We will publicise the top ten in early December and you can vote for your favourite. The winner will be announced during the week of 21 December.</p>
