<p><strong>Wednesday, 11 November 2020, 1:18 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>A research project headed by Lincoln University Plant Biosecurity Distinguished Professor Philip Hulme will focus on finding new methods for managing potentially invasive plant species.</p>
<p>The study investigates why some non-native ornamental plants become environmental weeds and aims to help forecast and prevent future biological invasions.</p>
<p>The Government has just announced a $798,000 boost for the project, with the grant to be distributed over the next three years through the 2020 Marsden Fund, which supports world-leading research.</p>
<p>Prof Hulme and his team will look at whether the prices of non-native ornamental plants, as well as their popularity with gardeners, contribute to them becoming invasive.</p>
<p>“Ornamental plants are the primary source of environmental weeds worldwide,” said Prof Hulme.</p>
<p>“These weeds pose serious threats to the natural environment and environmentally-based economic sectors. It’s not well understood why some non-native species escape from cultivation to become invasive weeds when others don’t.</p>
<p>“This research will test the hypothesis that non-native ornamental plant species become invasive as a result of factors that affect demand for garden plants: gardener preferences for particular biological attributes, as well as plant prices.”</p>
<p>Prof Hulme said the research would integrate economics, biology and human behaviour to forecast future biological invasions by non-native ornamental plants.</p>
<p>“We’ll use an extensive collection of historical nursery catalogues to assess how the risk of plant invasions is shaped by the price, prevalence and popularity of non-native plants in terms of their biological attributes.”</p>
<p>A clearer understanding of the behavioural and economic drivers of ornamental plant invasions will underpin the development of more successful methods to manage potentially invasive plant species.</p>
<p>“The current approaches are based on sales and import bans but a broader plan is needed,” he said.</p>
<p>Distinguished Professor Hulme won the Hutton Medal from the Royal Society Te Aparangi in 2019 for his “outstanding contributions to knowledge about plant invasions in New Zealand”.</p>
<p>He currently leads the Biosecurity Theme in the Bio-Protection Research Centre, a Centre of Research Excellence hosted by Lincoln University. The centre was established in 2003 to drive innovation in sustainable approaches to pests, pathogens and weed control.</p>
<p>The centre has seven partner institutes: Lincoln University, AgResearch, Massey University, Plant &amp; Food Research, Scion, the University of Canterbury, and the University of Otago, with members throughout New Zealand.</p>
