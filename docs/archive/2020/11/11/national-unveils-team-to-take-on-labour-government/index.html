<p><strong>Wednesday, 11 November 2020, 1:03 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National’s new caucus line-up reflects the party’s wealth of talent and experience across a range of portfolios, but most importantly in the crucial areas of health and the economy, Leader of the Opposition Judith Collins says.</p>
<p>“The National Party caucus is ready to roll up its sleeves and focus on what will be challenging times ahead as we deal with the impact of Covid-19 and the economic fallout from our closed borders.</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s economic recovery will be at the forefront of everything we do. National’s new line-up shows we are putting some of our best, most qualified people at the heart of this effort with a shadow cabinet brimming with business experience.</p>
<p>“Dr Shane Reti will look after the Health and Children portfolios. Not only has he practiced family medicine and dermatology for 16 years and is a fellow of the Royal NZ College of GPs, but he is also registered with Chartered Accountants Australia &amp; New Zealand and has worked in an economic development role with the New Zealand consulate in Dubai.</p>
<p>“Andrew Bayly will take on the new role of Shadow Treasurer, as well as the Infrastructure and Statistics portfolios. Andrew is a trained accountant who worked with merchant banks in New Zealand and London. His wealth of financial knowledge will be a real asset.</p>
<p>“Andrew will work side-by-side with Michael Woodhouse who will take on the Finance and Transport Portfolios. Prior to entering Parliament in 2008 and serving as a minister, Michael worked as an accountant in Dunedin. He has experience as a senior manager at HealthCare Otago and ACC, and has been the Chief Executive at Mercy Hospital in Dunedin.</p>
<p>“Lousie Upston will oversee the Social Development and Employment, Social Investment, Whānau Ora and Land Information portfolios. She has a wealth of ministerial experience, having held a number of portfolios including Corrections, Associate Education and Associate Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment.</p>
<p>“Prior to entering Parliament Louise was self-employed as a project management consultant, and founded her first business at the age of 19.</p>
<p>“National is a Government-in-waiting with a strong mix of former Ministers and senior MPs alongside emerging talent.</p>
<p>“We will work hard for all New Zealanders and hold the Labour Government to account, earning the right to govern in 2023.”</p>
