<p><strong>Sunday, 9 August 2020, 2:34 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Kia ora everyone.</p>
<p>Thank you all for coming here today. Thank you to the community for having us today, I’m proud that this is my neighbourhood!</p>
<p>And thank you to the Housing Foundation for having us, as we announce the next exciting pillar of our Green vision for Aotearoa.</p>
<p>The Green Party knows that housing is a human right.</p>
<p>We all deserve to live in a warm, dry, and affordable home.</p>
<p>Whether you rent or own, good housing is a baseline for a good life.</p>
<p>But we also know that a home is not just four walls.</p>
<p>We should all be able to put down roots, and feel secure in where we live.</p>
<p>Not only do we have this right to good housing – but we deserve to be a part of a community, too. Where everyone is empowered to participate and to live sustainably.</p>
<p>Never before have we seen the importance of that sense of community, than during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>We took the time to check in on each other – be it a quick phone call, a text, or a ‘kia ora’ over the fence.</p>
<p>And we worked as one big team to beat something bigger than each of us individually.</p>
<p>We are at a crossroads right now and have a unique opportunity to reimagine our communities for the better.</p>
<p>Where access to a quality home becomes a reality across Aotearoa.</p>
<p>For too long successive Governments have encouraged property speculators to buy up houses, and treated homes as no more than a money-making tool.</p>
<p>People in power sold off too much of our social and community housing.</p>
<p>Advertisement - scroll to continue reading</p>
<p>And they allowed the homes we do have to become unhealthy and unfit for purpose.</p>
<p>This has meant that keeping a roof over your head has become more difficult.</p>
<p>Many people – who are working as hard as they can - are struggling to pay the rent.</p>
<p>People who used to dream of home ownership have now written it off as an unachievable goal.</p>
<p>Precarious tenancies and unfair rules mean people who rent are at constant risk of upheaval.</p>
<p>And people cannot put down roots, or feel secure in where they live.</p>
<p>In short – there are not enough affordable houses and they aren’t up to scratch.</p>
<p>And too many people who rent are living with the uncertainty of not knowing how long they’ll be able to stay.</p>
<p>This is not good enough.</p>
<p>But what is good, is that we have solutions to these problems. We don’t have to let this continue with business as usual, watching as things get worse.</p>
<p>This term, the Green Party’s achieved a whole lot on the housing front.</p>
<p>Just this week we passed a new law to drastically improve the situation for people who rent – including removing no-cause eviction notices.</p>
<p>We introduced the Healthy Homes Standards for rental insulation and heating.</p>
<p>With the Green Party’s support, this government has delivered more social housing than any previous government since the 1970s - and requiring all new builds to be at least Home Star 6 rated for energy efficiency.</p>
<p>And we got a Progressive Home Ownership scheme off the ground – with the first two providers announced in Auckland and Queenstown.</p>
<p>But we know we must think ahead, and act now, to address our housing woes.</p>
<p>And to create the kind of communities we deserve, which flourish alongside the natural environment and where people look out for one another.</p>
<p>The Green Party’s Homes for All Plan takes us further, faster.</p>
<p>We know we need more affordable housing.</p>
<p>Right now, there are over 18,000 households waiting for a home.</p>
<p>The Green Party will ensure the Crown build programme delivers enough affordable new rental properties to clear the waiting list within five years.</p>
<p>We will do this while ensuring no net-loss of publicly owned land.</p>
<p>These homes will be sustainable, and accessible.</p>
<p>And they will be safe, warm, and dry – built to an overhauled building code with the standards we should all expect in 2020.</p>
<p>On existing stock, the Greens will build on the success of our Warmer Kiwi Homes programme, to retrofit tens of thousands more homes.</p>
<p>Not only does this mean more families will have a warm, dry home to live in – but it will help reduce the impact of our houses on the planet.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Under the current system, home ownership has become a distant dream for many of us.</p>
<p>High rents make saving for a deposit almost impossible.</p>
<p>We know that Progressive Home Ownership schemes are a crucial bridge to help people on low incomes buy their own home – if that is what they want to do. This neighbourhood right here is the very example of what we are trying to achieve - supporting more families to own their own.</p>
<p>The Green Party will expand the current scheme in our Confidence and Supply agreement, and embed it as a core part of the Government’s housing response.</p>
<p>This expansion will have a particular focus on funding Māori providers.</p>
<p>We also know that over half of the population are renting, and this will increase.</p>
<p>And that we must do more to make long-term renting a good option.</p>
<p>This week, I was really proud to see the residential reform legislation pass.</p>
<p>That change reflects what the Greens already know, that we must level the playing field between tenants and landlords.</p>
<p>In fact, we must transform the rental sector, so it is focused on ensuring people have good homes, not just on making a quick buck.</p>
<p>Our Homes for All Plan will create a sustainable, non-profit rental sector, by offering Crown financial guarantees for Community Housing Providers, including iwi, to build new properties which can be rented out long-term.</p>
<p>This plan is about supporting the people already doing the work – our community housing providers – to create community and iwi-led, purpose-built, rental housing.</p>
<p>We will also reduce the regulatory and funding barriers on these providers to encourage them to scale up their work, with a particular focus on papakainga.</p>
<p>These homes would be managed as long-term rentals, giving people who rent real security.</p>
<p>Our plan introduces a much-needed rental Warrant of Fitness – so people know their home is up to scratch.</p>
<p>We will regulate the rental industry, by holding property managers to the same standard as real estate agents.</p>
<p>And we will finally create standards for tertiary accommodation providers.</p>
<p>To measure our progress, we will create a national measure of affordable housing, and require Kāinga Ora to work towards a target of universal affordable housing.</p>
<p>So in summary. All of us deserve good housing.</p>
<p>And I’ll say it again – our homes should be warm, dry, and healthy.</p>
<p>They should be affordable, and secure – regardless of whether you rent or own.</p>
<p>Our homes should be accessible, and form the basis of real, thriving communities which look out for each other.</p>
<p>The Greens will build more homes, and make sure they are sustainable and warm.</p>
<p>We must create a non-profit rental industry which focuses on homing people long-term, not making money.</p>
<p>And we will empower community housing providers, hapū, and iwi, so they can scale up and expand their forward-thinking and innovative solutions.</p>
<p>We know that Māori are disproportionately represented across all areas of the housing crisis.</p>
<p>Part of ensuring everyone in Aotearoa has a home is affirming the leadership of iwi and hapū.</p>
<p>Our plan shows that we know how essential it is to have a tangata whenua response to all parts of the housing crisis.</p>
<p>Māori have the enduring solutions to take care of their communities, and the Crown has a Tiriti obligation to support that.</p>
<p>Good housing is a human right.</p>
<p>It is the basis of our communities. It can help us thrive.</p>
<p>Our Homes for All Plan is another example of the Greens thinking ahead, and acting now, to level the playing field of Aotearoa.</p>
<p>And to ensure we all have what we need.</p>
<p>With your support, our vision can be a reality.</p>
