<p>“After voting to end the opportunities provided by Partnership Schools, the <a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=5xNnogsdD9yGIfGEM2rlXVmVCY4ANUJ4SoMnzguSGYxz0vGVumVPBC8R5QDtpm_e1BwT5eEWmzUPoivXSEGg6EFP8vvQeQEGy9AJ1w_1MLG32gnZctdAtJ0JwWkSBCZWIAjy62iQYzTmPtyobQoUAtQ5yzT6oHD3Qq3K5YjsB_CooouvpogS2t0UliSMuI5d&e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=greens_school_choice&n=2">Greens’ financial support</a> for a green private school is deeply hypocritical,” according to ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“If the Greens have seen the light on educational choice, that should be welcomed, but it shouldn’t be a political issue.</p>
<p>“It isn’t acceptable to promote alternatives to the state education monopoly only when they’re promoting particular ideas.</p>
<p>“All parents and students deserve choice and empowerment.</p>
<p>“New Zealand experiences significant educational inequality. We have some of the highest-performing schools and students in the world, but we also have a long tail of underachievement in disadvantaged communities. A 2014 report by the Tertiary Education Commission found 40 percent of Year 12 students failed to meet international benchmarks for literacy and numeracy even though they had NCEA Level 2.</p>
<p>“This is the result of a one-size-fits-all state education monopoly run by the Ministry of Education and the teachers’ unions.</p>
<p>“ACT would put parents in control of the education budget and provide every child with a Student Education Account.</p>

<p>“A student will receive $250,000 of taxpayer-funded education over their life, but parents have little choice in how it’s spent. ACT will empower parents by placing this money in a Student Education Account. Parents will be able to use that funding at any registered educational institution that will accept their child’s enrolment, public or private.</p>
<p>“We’ll also increase choice in our education system by allowing any state school to apply to become a Partnership School. Government should fund a range of schools, letting parents and children choose what is right for them, not simply forcing them to go to their local state school. We should celebrate diversity, not a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
<p>“Before Labour scrapped them, Partnership Schools made do with far less funding and served poorer, less-engaged students.</p>
<p>“School choice is far too important to be treated as just another political issue.”</p>
