<p><strong>Thursday, 27 August 2020, 11:14 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Education Minister needs to front up and explain his extraordinary decision to approve $11.7 million of taxpayers’ money for the privately-owned Taranaki Green School, National’s Education spokesperson Nicola Willis says.</p>
<p>“The Minister has very serious questions to answer about why this exclusive private school has been granted such an extraordinary amount of money.”</p>
<p>The large sum involved means the Education Minister will have been required to sign it off, according to Provincial Growth Fund criteria. Labour&#39;s policy is that private schools can only access small operational subsidies, out of a capped fund, of between $1000 and $2000 per student, which was also National&#39;s policy in Government.</p>
<p>Taranaki Green School reportedly has a roll of just 50 students and fees of about $20,000 per year, so the funding works out to be about $200,000 per student.</p>
<p>“That is eye-wateringly generous,” Ms Willis says.</p>
<p>“What is going on here? Has Labour’s policy now changed? Will other private schools now be able to get similar grants for new buildings?</p>
<p>“This hypocritical deal flies in the face of rules for private school funding at a time when many schools across the country are crying out for Government help to fund much-needed construction, including nearby New Plymouth Boys High and Girls High.</p>
<p>“National welcomes the choice and innovation private schools can bring to our education system, but we have a problem with this hypocritical and unfair deal.</p>

<p>“Labour also opposes public-private partnerships for schools, and this is a private school being built by a private company, so why is it OK for a green school but not others?</p>
<p>“Then there’s the Greens’ policy, which opposes public funding for private schools, which makes James Shaw’s cheerleading for this project look especially bizarre.</p>
<p>“Chris Hipkins needs to tell the public how this dirty little deal was approved at the expense of other education priorities.”</p>
