<p><strong>Monday, 10 August 2020, 10:04 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National will encourage more drivers to get car insurance and make life easier for Kiwis to sort out damage claims by requiring vehicle insurers to be displayed on registration labels.</p>
<p>“Thousands of responsible Kiwis end up out of pocket or taking legal action because of the irresponsible actions of uninsured drivers,” National Party Leader Judith Collins says.</p>
<p>“Uninsured drivers cost responsible drivers millions of dollars, National doesn’t believe that&#39;s fair.</p>
<p>“Many people think vehicle insurance should be compulsory but that would be expensive and difficult to enforce. We have another idea to make it easier when you’re involved in a crash.”</p>
<p>National will:<br>• Require car insurer details to be displayed on car registration labels<br>• Require vehicles that don’t have, as a minimum, third party car insurance to display the word ‘uninsured’ on their registration label<br>• Link the Motor Vehicle Database with insurer details to help assist in the smooth exchange of insurer details in the event they are required.</p>
<p>“This will solve the problem of some drivers who lie about their insurance status to protect their excess,” Ms Collins says.</p>
<p>“If anyone was involved in an accident with you, you could literally walk over and see who their insurer was.”</p>
<p>National’s Transport spokesperson Chris Bishop said insurance would not be compulsory, but there would be an annual check on the vehicle’s insurance status.</p>
<p>“By applying a bit of nudge theory we believe it is highly likely to increase insurance uptake, because who wants to drive around with an ‘uninsured’ vehicle sticker in their window?”</p>
<p>A Ministry of Transport survey of 4000 New Zealanders from 2009 found about 7 per cent of vehicle owners had an uninsured vehicle or did not know whether their vehicle was insured.  </p>
