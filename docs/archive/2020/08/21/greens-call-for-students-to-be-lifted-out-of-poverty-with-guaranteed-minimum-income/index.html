<p><strong>Friday, 21 August 2020, 5:24 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Green Party is calling for a Guaranteed Minimum Income to be implemented after the election to help students not captured by the wage subsidy scheme.</p>
<p>Green Tertiary Education spokesperson Chlöe Swarbrick said today:</p>
<p>“COVID-19 has not created poverty and inequality, but simply exposed it. The lid has been lifted on just how many young people are doing it tough in this country.</p>
<p>“We support the wage subsidy scheme being rolled out by Government to support New Zealanders, but we know students aren’t benefitting from that support.</p>
<p>“That’s because many students are experiencing the increased casualisation of work, which creates ongoing instability and shows how our social support doesn’t capture everyone like it should.</p>
<p>“The Government should investigate how these students can be better supported in the immediate term. In the medium to long term, we must implement a Guaranteed Minimum Income, which would ensure students receive $325 per week, no matter what.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 has served immense struggle across our communities, revealing just how much students are hovering at the breadline.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t be a rite of passage to live in poverty during higher education. Let’s fix it.”</p>
