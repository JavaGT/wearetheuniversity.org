<p><strong>Friday, 21 August 2020, 2:20 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“The continuation of Auckland’s lockdown is a costly disappointment that could have been avoided with ACT’s wellbeing approach,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“If the wellbeing lens had been applied, the Government would have spent the past 102 days preparing to protect the vulnerable, rather than declaring &#39;mission accomplished&#39;.</p>
<p>“The Government and its cheerleaders want to compare our response with the worst in the world, rather than learning from the best in the world – such as Taiwan, to see how we can improve and better keep Kiwis safe.</p>
<p>“It should have been enhancing our contact tracing. Instead, it’s only become compulsory for businesses to have a QR Code displayed this week. This should have been in place long before now. The real cost is uncertainty. Who would invest in a business now when the Government might shut it down at any moment?</p>
<p>“Auckland would have watched the Prime Minister’s hour-long lecture at lunchtime with huge disappointment, knowing the Government hadn’t done enough to let them out of lockdown early.”</p>
<p>ACT’s wellbeing plan includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A multi-disciplinary Epidemic Response Centre</li>
<li>Government as a referee, not player: Allow alternative isolation where safe and be electronically monitored; strict punishment for rule-breakers</li>
<li>A risk-weighted response: treat different countries and travellers with different levels of caution</li>
<li>A technology-driven response: use innovations such as the COVID Card, GPS locatable cell phones and Datamine’s ëlarm.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Critically, ACT’s approach would ensure businesses could continue to operate, students could continue to learn and we don’t have the stress of constant lockdowns looming over us.&quot;</p>
