<p><strong>Wednesday, 5 August 2020, 12:33 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>With the June 2020 quarter showing underemployment increasing, the Green Party is calling for a Guaranteed Minimum Income and an increase to the abatement threshold to ensure everyone has a dignified income.</p>
<p>&quot;COVID-19 has left tens of thousands more people working less hours than they want, resulting in less stable incomes and more uncertainty for families.</p>
<p>&quot;Successive Governments have kept benefits low and created a social security net based on punishment instead of support. The Green Party&#39;s Poverty Action Plan is critically needed so families are able to have enough to live on, even if they are experiencing reduced work hours.</p>
<p>“Our Guaranteed Minimum Income of $325 and an increase to the abatement threshold will mean that New Zealanders losing paid hours continue to live with dignity.</p>
<p>&quot;While we have made progress to lift the abatement threshold and increased core benefits by $25 this term, we know there is more urgent work to do to mend our social safety net so we can face the impacts of COVID-19 in our job market.</p>
<p>“The Greens remain the only political party with a plan to ensure everyone can access support when they need it”.</p>
<p>The Green Party’s Poverty Action Plan will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reset income support payments to ensure everyone not in fulltime paid work, including students, has income of at least $325 a week.</li>
<li>Support sole parents with a top-up of $110, bringing their base payments to $435 per week.</li>
<li>Change abatement and relationship rules so people and their partners can earn more from paid work before their income support entitlements are reduced.</li>
<li>Provide a $100 a week universal payment to families for each child under three, building on the existing Best Start system.</li>
<li>Replace Working for Families tax credits with a single Family Support Credit of $190 per week for the first child and $120 per week for subsequent children, with a higher abatement threshold and lower abatement rate.</li>
<li>Reform ACC into an Agency for Comprehensive Care covering all health-related income support within a single system with guaranteed payments of at least 80% of the fulltime minimum wage.</li>
<li>Introduce a wealth tax for those with a net-worth over $1 million, and introduce top-tier tax brackets for the highest earners.</li>
</ul>
