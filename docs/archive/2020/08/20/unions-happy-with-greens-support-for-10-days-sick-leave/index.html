<p><strong>Thursday, 20 August 2020, 5:54 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Council_of_Trade_Unions">Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p>The Council of Trade Unions is happy that the Green Party is supporting 10 days paid sick leave for all working Kiwis.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been campaigning for safer sick leave, and the Greens have listened to voices of <a href="https://www.together.org.nz/safer-sick-leave">thousands</a> of working Kiwis,&quot; CTU President Richard Wagstaff said.</p>
<p>&quot;Increasing the legal minimum from 5 days to 10 years a year is a basic issue of safety. COVID-19 has really focused all our minds on the importance of staying home when you are sick. But the current reality of a legal minimum of 5 days sick leave is unrealistic in achieving the goal of people staying away from work if they are unwell.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lots of working people have better than the legal minimum sick leave entitlement - often union members have achieved better through collective bargaining.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We look forward to hearing from all political parties that they also support safer sick leave with an increase to 10 days paid sick leave for all working people,&quot; Wagstaff said.</p>
