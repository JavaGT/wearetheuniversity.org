<p><strong>Thursday, 20 August 2020, 4:01 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“ACT has today announced its Covid-19 Response Policy which has a focus on wellbeing”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“The Government has had a strategy for dealing with Covid-19 under its nose all along. A wellbeing approach weighs up all of the costs and benefits of human welfare on each choice the Government makes.</p>
<p>“Being free of Covid-19 is one dimension of wellbeing. We also have to think about a generation of students’ one shot at life-defining exams, the mental health of small business owners run ragged, and non-Covid healthcare such as missed elective surgeries.</p>
<p>“Then there are financial costs. If we take one estimate from a major bank, a Level 3 lockdown in Auckland costs $440 million a week. 16 days is a $1 billion. That’s Pharmac’s entire budget for all taxpayer-funded medicine for a year.</p>
<p>ACT’s approach includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A multi-disciplinary Epidemic Response Centre</li>
<li>Government as referee, not player: allow alternative isolation where safe and be electronically monitored; strict punishment for rule-breakers</li>
<li>A risk-weighted response: treat different countries and travellers with different levels of caution</li>
<li>A technology-driven response: use innovations such as the COVID Card, GPS locatable cell phones and Datamine’s ëlarm</li>
</ul>
<p>“If we want to enhance New Zealanders’ overall wellbeing, then we must get a lot smarter. The steps above would make us more like Taiwan so that we can eat our cake and be safe from Covid, too.”</p>
