<p>“Labour has spent 618 days failing to pass the most basic of laws to ban kids from vaping,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“We know Labour isn’t afraid to pass a law in a matter of hours. It just passed a law under urgency to register forestry traders. But will it pass a common sense vaping law in the dying days of this Parliament?</p>
<p>“Associate Health Minister Jenny Salesa has been the most inept Minister in the most incompetent government in New Zealand’s history.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=jHGEcXvs8EsTIWjQeNaHlcZmu3WuHLdTsK6tlqWh1O_VPYjBJrHeFKk6s0u7vb-6MMhiQwDbg_Km4baJcwuUrp9eeMr_ofc2dgXOQ1A81FHAQBQEc2gRimWSpqurDhAk&e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=vaping_incompetence&n=2">Back in November 2018 – 618 days ago – she told New Zealanders that she intended to regulate vaping</a>.</p>
<p>“Now, it’s likely that the legislation won’t pass before the election, with the Prime Minister blaming National.</p>
<p>“All Labour needed to do was to ban the sale of vaping devices and nicotine e-liquids to under 18s.</p>
<p>“This straightforward change would have support across the Parliament and would prevent vaping products from falling into the hands of children.</p>
<p>“But the legislation before Parliament fails to do this. It could be achieved by requiring ID when purchasing from a New Zealand vaping website or when couriers drop off vaping products. Neither measure is in the law.</p>

<p>“Labour is instead proposing to ban flavours and advertising for all New Zealanders which would be the worst imaginable outcome.</p>
<p>“Punishing tobacco taxes haven’t brought down smoking rates, but the market has delivered a safe, innovative solution for smokers wanting to quit. Thousands of smokers are switching to vaping.</p>
<p>“Labour should be putting vaping and smoking on a level playing field so that 500,000 smokers have an incentive to quit. Wholesale banning of vaping flavours and advertising would mean that smokers keep smoking for longer at a massive cost to their health and the country.</p>
<p>“All of this is irrelevant for now because Labour can’t even get a simple amendment through Parliament banning the sale of vaping devices and nicotine e-liquids to under 18s.”</p>
