<p>“A consensus is growing for a Wellbeing Approach to tackling COVID-19 with the Director-General of the World Health Organisation calling lockdowns unsustainable,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=l9NW-IN2RLG8bU3ydElSFoLPs7Rn8yd-oZsr9JcC7YSqFEVTKXuGL_DyqDNjKeqBkuoYjQ8dMMa7h67C4zrUBe_FybJ8A6QcIHVxQkUjC2kxU-dC3XaJUdvgnOi2adDyoh0S6qQ5MfuA7D9UgnJCes9WvFPdUHcAp2LLH6Xr17fiyEygyiDV09vQ2iI3K25l&e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=who_lockdowns_unsustainable&n=2">Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said</a>: <em>‘We must all learn to control and manage this virus using the tools we have now…lockdowns are not a long-term solution for any country.’</em></p>
<p>“We’ve lost sight of the costs and uncertainty created by lockdowns and we need to ask how elimination can be made affordable.</p>
<p>“A Wellbeing Approach to Covid-19 considers all of the costs of fighting Covid-19 in a world where we can’t guarantee against an outbreak.</p>
<p>“It’s not affordable or sustainable to continue with rolling lockdowns.</p>
<p>“Being free of Covid-19 is just one dimension of wellbeing. We also have to think about a generation of students’ one shot at life-defining exams, the mental health of small business owners run ragged, non-Covid healthcare such as missed elective surgeries, and families who can’t travel to Auckland for funerals.</p>
<p>“Then there are financial costs. If we take one estimate from a major bank, a Level 3 lockdown in Auckland costs $440 million a week. 16 days is $1 billion. That is Pharmac’s entire budget for all taxpayer-funded medicine for a year.</p>

<p>“The goal of ACT’s Wellbeing Approach is to reduce costs and uncertainty and make the elimination strategy affordable.</p>
<h2>ACT’s policy is:</h2>
<p>• New Zealand Epidemic Response Unit: Based on Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Centre<br>• Government as referee, not player: Allow alternative facilities for safe, electronically-monitored isolation, with strict punishment for rule-breakers<br>• Risk-weighted: Treat different countries and travellers with different levels of caution<br>• Technology-driven: Such as COVID card, ëlarm, rapid tests, temperature checks and thermal cameras<br>• Continuous improvement: Constantly compare ourselves with the best and seek to strengthen our resistance.</p>
<p>“If we want to enhance New Zealanders’ overall wellbeing, we must get a lot smarter. If we take a broad-based approach, and remain aware of all aspects of wellbeing, then we will be truly better off in every sense. A Party Vote for ACT is a vote to tackle Covid-19 intelligently.”</p>
