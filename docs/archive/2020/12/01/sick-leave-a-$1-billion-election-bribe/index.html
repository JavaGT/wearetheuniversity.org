<p><strong>Tuesday, 1 December 2020, 3:46 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“Labour’s sick leave legislation is a $1 billion election bribe”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“The Government’s regulatory impact statement says five days’ extra sick leave will have a price tag for businesses of almost $1 billion a year and could reduce the number of jobs being created.</p>
<p>“Nowhere does Labour justify this policy with evidence that there isn’t enough sick leave now. It is an election bribe disguised as a health measure, pure and simple.</p>
<p>“Of course, the real game is that the Government is massively indebted and is now buying votes by making employers pay more sick leave.</p>
<p>“Only Labour would claim that five days off for 2.7 million people is a solution for a handful of people who need to isolate for 14 days.</p>
<p>“In the last quarter, 37,000 workers lost employment. Labour is piling new costs on the very job creators we need to be supporting right now.</p>
<p>“If 1 April’s minimum wage increase is in line with the previous two hikes, it will cost employers around $270 million and reduce job creation even further.</p>
<p>“Then there’s a new public holiday and ‘fair pay’ agreements. Who would want to be a business owner right now?</p>
<p>“New Zealand is in recession, and the recovery will be long and fragile. Small businesses can’t afford the costs and red tape Labour is piling on.</p>
<p>“The decision to provide part-time and full-time workers with the same amount sick leave will create absurd situations where ‘if an employee worked one day a week, an entitlement to 10 days sick leave would give an employee paid sick leave for 20 per cent of their working year.’</p>

<p>“Labour has a responsibility to support businesses to recover, not kick them while they’re down.</p>
<p>“For a recovery to happen, one New Zealander has to decide to employ another, hundreds of thousands of times over in the coming years. This legislation tips the scales away from recovery.</p>
<p>“Labour doesn’t understand small business. ACT’s caucus has seven business owners and we have a real plan to help the economy recover.</p>
<p>“We would put a three-year moratorium on raising the minimum wage, reinstate 90-day trials for all businesses, and cut GST to 10 percent for 12 months.”</p>
