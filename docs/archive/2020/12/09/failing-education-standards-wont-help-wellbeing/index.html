<p><strong>Wednesday, 9 December 2020, 11:05 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>News that New Zealand’s 13 year olds have recorded their worst-ever results in the latest international comparison study (TIMMS) should be ringing alarm bells across the education sector, National’s Education spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>“We rightly focus on the wellbeing of our children, but we can’t forget that equipping students with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in a competitive world is critical to their wellbeing and that of their families.</p>
<p>“We aspire to high living standards, but we won’t continue to achieve those high living standards if our educational achievement is falling off the pace internationally.</p>
<p>“While these are long-standing issues, the study results show that we urgently need a greater focus on educational achievement at primary and intermediate schools. Our best schools are doing a great job, but too many children appear to be missing out on the opportunities they need.</p>
<p>“These results show more needs to be done to ensure children arrive at secondary school with firm foundations in core areas of reading, writing and maths.</p>
<p>“National is prepared to have meaningful discussions with the sector about what’s being taught, how it’s been taught and how we assess progress externally at key points.”</p>
