<p><strong>Tuesday, 8 December 2020, 2:47 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Housing statistics released today and over the weekend show an unfolding disaster for New Zealand families and communities, National’s Housing spokesperson Nicola Willis says.</p>
<p>“We now have the lowest rates of home-ownership we’ve seen in 70 years, the biggest social housing waiting list on record and record numbers of Kiwis turning to emergency housing.</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s housing problems are fast becoming a national emergency. Where is the urgency in the Government response?</p>
<p>“It’s time for emergency measures to get more houses built, like those used in Christchurch to rebuild the thousands of houses that were wiped-out by that disaster.”</p>
<p>The National Government at the time recognised emergency regulations needed to free up land and remove development constraints. As a result, new house building took off.</p>
<p>The surge in housing supply put a lid on affordability, with the ‘multiple’ between median incomes and median house prices stabilising in Christchurch for the period 2014-2020, while elsewhere cumbersome regulations resulted in housing become more unaffordable.</p>
<p>National is willing to work with the Government to develop immediate measures modelled on the Christchurch response by zoning more land for housing, over-riding the RMA appeals process and increasing leniency on the timing of provision of infrastructure.</p>
<p>“If we get the regulations right, developers will build at scale and pace,” Ms Willis says.</p>
<p>“We can’t afford to wait years for this Government to get on with Resource Management Act reform while house prices continue to rocket.</p>
<p>“Faced with an emergency of inter-generational proportions, action is required.”</p>
