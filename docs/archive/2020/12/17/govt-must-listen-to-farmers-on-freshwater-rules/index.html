<p>“The Government must listen to feedback from farmers on its freshwater rules,” says ACT’s Primary Industries spokesperson Mark Cameron.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=5xNnogsdD9yGIfGEM2rlXQpBvAmlSKgQ1yvvgy9PLRoYYmckGT3qHtVudzIK5dLVEWvwKjbr8QjiFBOLA4WLXrPN1NtNPsmwirDnMszkrewSaHHUVaqzhfrku2-zN-xX-GVyBiOGwhwkjCPxf_7yNuY7b0ZbTgu9F3VQ6sNQzaE&e=1436fca17bda55074760909e04a8a403&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=southland_group_freshwater&n=2"><em>Stuff</em> reports</a> that the Southland Advisory Group has recommended pugging rules and resowing dates be scrapped from the National Environmental Standards for Freshwater.</p>
<p>“ACT has said from the outset that the rules are impractical and will seriously impact on production.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=7EL176YFyxKF3ox3wD2rUTppx6-88SttUw15w_iLCi7prrkX37qfuI3GEjE0Woe3cnLHCo2B8ooNMYcIsHnxdMeduQ1opqgRlU3t41TnQ1tSyJlAS1IWkZZqTwlhYVufLlnkeZDSj3rGuUoj60DpTF7JmKlMRyP6MWDxmefVccAckyN1qAShk7rL-GvSsRFn&e=1436fca17bda55074760909e04a8a403&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=southland_group_freshwater&n=3">Last week</a>, an Economic Impact Report on Land and Water Management in the Ashburton District suggested the rules would reduce farm profitability by 83 percent a year.</p>
<p>“As a result, farmers won’t be able to invest in their operations, with farm expenditure estimated to decline by $139.9 million a year across the district, perversely making them less effective managers of their land and stock.</p>
<p>“The rules require all paddocks to be resown by 1 October or 1 November in Otago and Southland.</p>
<p>“That’s completely unrealistic given seasonal variations in snowfall and flooding. It would be difficult to implement in most years.</p>
<p>“Seasonal ground temperatures need to be above 10 degrees for crop germination in these regions. The ground temperature is often significantly lower and crops will fail.</p>
<p>“Rather than putting restrictive sowing dates on these crops, there needs to be flexibility in accommodating seasonal variations in rainfall and ground temperature.</p>
<p>“Farmers are the greatest environmentalists and have more incentive than anyone to want better water quality, but the policies for achieving it must be practical.</p>
<p>“Local issues must have local solutions, not a one-size-fits-all approach made by Wellington bureaucrats that clearly don’t understand farming.</p>
<p>“The Government needs to listen to feedback from rural New Zealand on what are clearly unworkable freshwater rules.”</p>
