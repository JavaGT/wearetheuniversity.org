<p>In a first for Aotearoa New Zealand, the University of Canterbury (UC) is offering a new four-year degree to upskill environmental scientists during a time of rising concern about climate change.</p>
<p>The Bachelor of Environmental Science with Honours degree has been developed in response to employer demand for students with specialised knowledge in the area.</p>
<p>UC’s Director of Environmental Science Professor Sally Gaw says environmental scientists are needed to step up and help address some of the urgent sustainability issues the world is facing.</p>

<p>“Rapid environmental change and diminishing resource means the planet needs - more than ever - highly skilled environmental scientists empowered to make a difference.”</p>
<p>UC’s unique offering builds on the university’s record of excellence in teaching and research in Environmental Science, she says. It will provide students with practical skills across varied disciplines of science.</p>
<p>“We are anticipating 30 enrolments next year and we expect that our Environmental Science with Honours graduates will be highly sought after by employers both in Aotearoa New Zealand and globally.</p>
<p>“Our aim is for students graduating with this qualification to be engaged, empowered, and ready to make a difference.”</p>
<p>It offers six choices of interdisciplinary major: Freshwater; Ecosystem Health and Biosecurity; Environmental Change; Environmental Contamination; Environmental Hazards and Disasters; and Sustainable Coasts.</p>
<p>Through classroom, lab and field studies, students will have the opportunity to learn research, data analysis, problem-solving, communication, and teamwork skills. The degree also combines mātauranga Māori with environmental research to provide students with indigenous knowledge and bicultural confidence.</p>
<p>As part of their studies, they will assess the impact of disasters, ecological change, and historical and current human activity.</p>
<p>A work experience component is also part of the degree.</p>
<p>Head of UC’s School of Earth and Environment, Professor James Shulmeister says it is a broad-based qualification. “The degree programme is solidly science based but will also provide students with an important underpinning in social and other issues around environmental science.”</p>
