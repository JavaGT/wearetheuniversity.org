<p><strong>Monday, 14 December 2020, 2:37 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“Confirmation from the Prime Minister that the Australian travel bubble is on the same go-slow schedule as the Cook Islands is a blow to all New Zealanders and Australians,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“Suggestions that airlines with grounded fleets need time to get up and running is more of an indictment on the Government than anything else.</p>
<p>“Tell them when to be ready and I&#39;m sure they’ll be ready.</p>
<p>“On 9 November it was reported that New Zealand Ministry of Health officials were considering lowering thresholds for quarantine-free travel with Australia.</p>
<p>“That same day the Prime Minister said while she’d had no advice on that she was considering tolerance levels of transmission as they related to Australia’s interstate borders.</p>
<p>“Those tolerance levels are now essentially academic – every interstate border in Australia has been relaxed, and New Zealanders can travel to Australia without needing to quarantine.</p>
<p>“Something very odd has happened over the past month to shift the prospect of quarantine free trans-Tasman travel to March 2021 at the earliest.</p>
<p>“Again, the Prime Minister is doing a very poor job of explaining why.”</p>
