<p>“<a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=7EL176YFyxKF3ox3wD2rUUfAwFlHyGHdAFdEb7L-76S-acUXd22yC-1nhpucCkApUVwz2esvEKzLWcY3ngLuQmpaVnj8pEAryd52PHEGId2QUdVNFhibYxDs8VMznzNRqnRrwOjsecfPDrDo66FYmg&e=752ed10e9ed7db3a7867d6b86ebadc6c&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=police_raid_young_family&n=2">A Police raid</a> on the home of a young family represents a dangerous new phase of the Government’s gun law reforms and raises serious questions about how gun owners are being targeted”, according to ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“According to a blog post, on Thursday, nearly a dozen armed police officers carried out a search warrant at the home of a young family having dinner. Officers were looking for a low-powered replica of an 1893 gun that is not even a semi-automatic. There was no cause for suspicion other than the fact that the person made a select committee submission.</p>
<p>“If the details are accurate, this is a deeply disturbing story and it raises serious questions.</p>
<p>“How did Police come to identify this person? Were his political views a factor? Was he identified by the fact that he made a submission on the new gun laws? If Police are politically targeting New Zealanders because they submitted to a select committee, the Police Minister’s position is untenable.</p>
<p>“Whatever happened to the Government’s goal of getting rid of semi-automatics? Police carried out this raid to search for a ‘bunny gun’ used to hunt rabbits. Why aren’t Police going after the gangs and criminals?</p>

<p>“ACT opposed the rushed Arms Amendment Act because we knew it would have unintended consequences. We’ve seen tens of thousands of guns go underground into the black market, a privacy breach, and now a dangerously misguided Police raid on a young family at dinner time over a bunny gun.</p>
<p>“This is why ACT consistently opposes giving more power to the government. Even if individual politicians mean well, the new powers are inevitably abused or have real-world consequences other than those that were intended.”</p>
