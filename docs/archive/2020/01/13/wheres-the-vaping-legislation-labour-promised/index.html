<p><strong>Monday, 13 January 2020, 1:55 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“More than a year after new vaping legislation was promised, and with the school year rapidly approaching, there’s still no sign of Labour’s vaping legislation”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“Labour announced plans to regulate vaping way back in November 2018. More than a year has passed and we’ve seen nothing from the Government.</p>
<p>“Associate Health Minister Jenny Salesa has said on multiple occasions that we’ll see a new law ‘very soon’.</p>
<p>“But we’re also told that there is a vaping epidemic in schools. If that is true, the first act of the Government when Parliament resumes must be to introduce legislation banning the sale of vaping devices and nicotine e-liquids to under 18s.</p>
<p>“The Government’s task should be to prevent these products from falling into the hands of children.</p>
<p>“But Salesa and Labour instead want to ban vaping flavours and advertising for all New Zealanders. This would be the worst imaginable outcome.</p>
<p>“Punishing tobacco taxes haven’t brought down smoking rates, but the free market has delivered a safe, innovative solution for smokers wanting to quit. Thousands of smokers are switching to this much safer alternative.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult not to wonder if Jenny Salesa is working with the tobacco companies. The Government wants to retain $2 billion in tobacco tax revenue and the tobacco companies want to keep people smoking.</p>
<p>“When the law is finally introduced, it must put vaping and smoking on a level playing field so that 500,000 smokers have an incentive to quit.</p>
<p>“Wholesale banning of vaping flavours and advertising would mean that smokers keep smoking for longer at a massive cost to their health and the country.”</p>
