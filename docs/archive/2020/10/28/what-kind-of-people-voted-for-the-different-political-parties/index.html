<p><strong>Wednesday, 28 October 2020, 3:40 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology">Auckland University of Technology</a></strong></p>
<p>AUT Emeritus Professor of Sociology Charles Crothers has put together a document that looks at what types of people voted for different political parties.</p>
<p>It compares the social characteristics of electorates from the census data, as well as providing the voting data in different ways.</p>
<p>The resource will be useful for researchers and journalists looking for patterns in the preliminary results for the 2020 General Election.</p>
<p>Emeritus Professor Crothers hopes to provide a similar examination of the final vote count and the referenda after November 6.</p>
<p>Some results from the preliminary votes:</p>
<p>Electorates with more children tended to vote for the Labour Party, suggesting support amongst middle age adults.</p>
<p>The Green Party has more support in electorates with a younger population.</p>
<p>The National Party and especially ACT support is highest among electorates with an older population.</p>
<p>ACT support is high amongst electorates with more people born in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Green Party support is correlated with fewer people born in New Zealand.</p>
<p>National Party, and especially ACT support, is higher in electorates with more NZ-Europeans whereas, the reverse was true for the Labour Party.</p>
<p>People in stronger Labour Party electorates were more likely to be regular smokers, whereas those with more Green Party voters not.</p>

<p>The National Party and Act vote was correlated with electorates that have more married people, whereas the Labour Party and Green Party vote wasn&#39;t.</p>
<p>People in electorates that voted more for the National Party and ACT were more likely to own their dwelling.</p>
<p>National Party and ACT voting electorates were more self- employed while Labour Party and Green Party-voting electorates were wage-earning.</p>
<p>Electorates with more managers voted more for the National Party and ACT, but electorates with more professionals gave more votes to the Green Party.</p>
<p>Electorates with a higher Labour Party vote had a lower NZ Socio-Economic Index (NZSEI) and those with more Green Party votes a higher NZSEI.</p>

<p>A previous analysis by Emeritus Professor Crothers looks at how New Zealanders’ attitudes to cannabis and euthanasia have changed over time.</p>
