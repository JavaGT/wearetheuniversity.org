<p><strong>Tuesday, 6 October 2020, 10:23 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“The ACT Party is once again leading the way with policy, with Jacinda Ardern this morning agreeing with our Covid-19 recovery plan first released in July,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“This morning the Prime Minister told media that she’s now getting advice on a risk-based approach for people travelling from other countries.</p>
<p>“ACT first suggested this on July 12th. We can’t treat people coming into New Zealand from Samoa where there is no Covid-19 the same way we treat people arriving from Victoria. It’s just common sense.</p>
<p>“ACT has consistently led the way with sensible policies, proving that a vote for ACT is a vote for common sense politics.</p>
<p>“Our full Covid-19 plan includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Zealand Epidemic Response Unit: Based on Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Centre</li>
<li>Government as referee, not player: Allow alternative facilities for safe, electronically-monitored isolation, with strict punishment for rule-breakers</li>
<li>Risk-weighted: Treat different countries and travellers with different levels of caution</li>
<li>Technology-driven: Such as the Covid Card, ëlarm, rapid tests, temperature checks and thermal cameras</li>
<li>Continuous improvement: Constantly compare ourselves with the best and seek to strengthen our resistance.</li>
</ul>
<p>“ACT will continue to introduce smart policies which benefit New Zealand. To enhance New Zealanders’ overall wellbeing, we must get a lot smarter. A Party Vote for ACT is a vote to tackle Covid-19 intelligently.”</p>
