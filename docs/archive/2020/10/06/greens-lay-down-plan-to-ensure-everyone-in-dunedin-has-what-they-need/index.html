<p><strong>Tuesday, 6 October 2020, 4:19 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Green Party Co-leader Marama Davidson and Green Party Social Development spokesperson Jan Logie will visit Dunedin tomorrow to make the case for the Poverty Action Plan.</p>
<p>“A strong social safety net is a crucial pillar for a thriving community. The Green Party wants an Aotearoa where we all have what we need, and has a plan to get us there,” Marama Davidson said today.</p>
<p>“Too many people in Dunedin are going without, when we have more than enough to go around. It’s time to create a fairer Aotearoa which works for all of us.</p>
<p>“Our Guaranteed Minimum Income would provide everyone outside of full-time paid employment, including students, with $325 per week – plus top ups for those with children, or disabled people.</p>
<p>“The best chance we have of getting this policy across the line is with the strongest possible Green voice working alongside Labour next term.</p>
<p>“Jan and I are really excited to share the Green Party’s vision for a fairer Aotearoa. We look forward to meeting with the Dunedin community.”</p>
