<p><strong>Sunday, 8 March 2020, 12:43 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>With four banks now forecasting negative growth it’s past time for the Government to announce a relief package to help people stay in their jobs, National’s Finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>“When Cabinet meets tomorrow, this should be at the top of its agenda. This needs to be a detailed package to support businesses and workers directly affected by the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>“We want to help people stay in their jobs, if possible, rather than hasten their shift to benefits.</p>
<p>“Tax relief across the economy is also needed, to put more money in Kiwis pockets.</p>
<p>“When National was in Government we took decisive action following the Canterbury earthquakes, the Kaikoura earthquake and the Global Financial Crisis.</p>
<p>“It now seems quite likely New Zealand will go into a recession this year.</p>
<p>“Businesses need clear and urgent action from the Government to help them through this period of uncertainty, not just tinkering around the edges and ad-hoc announcements that lack detail.”</p>
