<p><strong>Saturday, 28 March 2020, 11:48 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Last night’s changes to the wage subsidy scheme appear to give large windfalls to part-time workers, which is an odd priority in a time of crisis, National’s Finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>“The new rules say that employers must pay workers the full subsidy amount even if it is more than their salary.</p>
<p>“So a part-timer such as a student doing 4 hours a week and earning $75, would now get the full part-time subsidy of $350 a week.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile someone with three part-time jobs, each worth $100 a week, could get three subsidies of $350 a week.</p>
<p>“This surely can’t be the Government’s intent.</p>
<p>“It’s hardly sensible that some people should gain massive pay-rises at a time when many workers are losing their jobs and many small business owners are losing their businesses.</p>
<p>“The Government should rectify this anomaly by adding a requirement to the wage subsidy scheme that businesses should pay their employees the lower amount of the wage subsidy amount, or their normal wages.</p>
<p>“It makes more sense to pay part-timers what they have been earning before the crisis, and then leave the surplus with employers so they have a better chance of paying their full-time workers somewhere near 80 per cent of their normal earnings.</p>
<p>“No system is perfect, but surely we can design a better scheme than this.”</p>
