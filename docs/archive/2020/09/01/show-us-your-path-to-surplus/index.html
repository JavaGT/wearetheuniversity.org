<p><strong>Tuesday, 1 September 2020, 9:53 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT Leader David Seymour has today challenged all other political parties to show New Zealanders their path to get back to surplus.</p>
<p>“By the time students currently at intermediate and high school start paying tax, we’ll be spending more on interest repayments than education. Treasury forecasts the interest on the debt will be $13 billion by 2030, or $13,000 every year for a family of five.</p>
<p>“They will ask, ‘what they hell were you thinking,’ when the Prime Minister went to Queenstown to get her photo taken with a bungee jump operator for $10 million, and the Green Party gave $12 million to a school where students learned about the healing power of crystals.</p>
<p>“Only ACT has a fully costed plan for economic recovery, which keeps the debt low, cuts taxes, and gets the country back to surplus, while keeping Kiwis in work.</p>
<p>“It’s astonishing that no other party has any kind of plan to get on top of debt:</p>
<p>“Labour? The current Government has set a course where we will not even begin to pay down debt until 2028.</p>
<p>“National? Every National policy announcement is to spend billions more.</p>
<p>“The Greens? The Greens want to introduce a $12 billion per year benefit, whether people need it or not.</p>
<p>“It’s time for all political parties to step up and be transparent about their plans. ACT is the party that will keep the others honest.</p>
<p>“The Government has committed to borrowing $140 billion on top of the $60 billion debt it had pre-Covid. For many families, their biggest debt will be the one the Government took on for them. The Government has left New Zealanders with a debt equivalent to having every family max out their credit cards.</p>
<p>“Only ACT has a fully costed plan to get back to surplus and start repaying the debt now.”</p>
