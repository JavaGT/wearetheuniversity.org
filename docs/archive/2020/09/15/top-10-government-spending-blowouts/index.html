<p><strong>Tuesday, 15 September 2020, 3:07 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“With $180 billion in debt and all other political parties in a race to see who can spend the most on election bribes, it’s time to remember the Top 10 spending blowouts from this Government,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“Our country is facing one of the largest economic disasters we’ve ever experienced. It’s time for prudent spending. We can’t afford to keep spending the way we have been.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders should be asking themselves whether they really want to vote for parties that brought in the following?”</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Provincial Growth Fund:</strong> This was a Shane Jones special, designed to be a shameless traveling roadshow of bribes, although it didn’t travel far from Northland. The $3 billion fund spent your money on bureaucrats travelling the country and created very few jobs.</li>
<li><strong>Callaghan Innovation:</strong> Originally the brainchild of Steven Joyce but happily carried on by Labour. This is bureaucratic money-go-round and another example of politicians thinking they know what’s best for business.</li>
<li><strong>Film subsidies:</strong> These are loved by blue and red Governments. Why should the film industry get a free pass? ACT believes Government should focus on having the best possible tax and regulatory systems to attract business from all sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Racing subsidies:</strong> ACT is champing at the bit to make sure industries don’t get special treatment just because they have a relationship with a politician.</li>
<li><strong>A Billion Trees:</strong> A pie in the sky plan that never stood a chance. Shane Jones just loves spending your money on things that create headlines but don’t actually benefit New Zealand.</li>
<li><strong>The Green Investment Fund:</strong> This is just more corporate welfare, delivered in a shade of green. The fund is designed to pick winners that can’t attract capital on the open market. It’s greenwashing.</li>
<li><strong>Green School:</strong> Sure, it’s part of the PGF but it deserves a special mention. James Shaw, although ideologically opposed to private schools, spent almost $12 million on a private school. Wasteful spending and hypocrisy don’t get worse than this.</li>
<li><strong>Fees Free:</strong> Another Labour bribe aimed at tertiary students that hasn’t delivered results. It hasn’t increased access to education and has primarily benefitted those who don’t need assistance.</li>
<li><strong>Bungee Jumping:</strong> Again, picking winners. The Prime Minister gave $10 million to get her photo taken with a multi-millionaire bungee jump operator.</li>
<li><strong>The Parliament Slide:</strong> Half a million dollars of taxpayers’ money should never have been spent on playground equipment, especially not on a slide this lame. Trevor Mallard has a lot to be embarrassed about from his time at Parliament, but this has got to be near the top of the list.</li>
</ol>
<p>“ACT has a plan to stop the spending splurge. We have a fully costed roadmap for economic recovery, which keeps the debt low, cuts taxes, and gets the country back to surplus, while keeping Kiwis in work.</p>
<p>“ACT is the only party that will hold the others to account. We’ll make sure New Zealand is ready for the next rainy day and that future generations don’t face a mountain of debt.”</p>
