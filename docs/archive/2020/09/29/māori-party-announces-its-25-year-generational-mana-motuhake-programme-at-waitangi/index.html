<p><strong>Tuesday, 29 September 2020, 10:38 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party">The Maori Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Māori Party Co-Leader said today’s Te Tiriti Policy release is a 25-year strategy that would bring about major change for Māori.</p>
<p>“Our policies are designed by Māori for Māori to Māori,” Tamihere said.</p>
<p>“They are not a 3 year lolly scramble. We must build a Māori middle class and we must break out of a welfare dependency. We must move from poverty to employment. Only we Māori can bring that change.”</p>
<p>The Māori Party will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Commit all Māori to the Māori electoral roll by 2023.</li>
<li>Entrench all Māori electorates.</li>
<li>Establish a Māori Parliament.</li>
<li>Implement all Matike Mai recommendations for constitutional transformation</li>
<li>Overhaul the Te Tiriti settlement process and end the fiscal envelope.</li>
<li>Insert relativity clauses into all Te Tiriti settlements, to ensure all iwi have parity with Ngāi Tahu and Waikato-Tainui.</li>
<li>Make Waitangi Tribunal recommendations binding on the Crown, and implement all unaddressed WAI claim recommendations.</li>
<li>Abolish “full and final” settlements and the “large natural groupings” approach to recognising mana whenua groups.</li>
<li>Return conservation land to whānau, hapū and iwi Māori.</li>
<li>Introduce a first right of refusal policy for mana whenua when private land of historical significance comes up for sale – like Ihumātao.</li>
<li>Remove the racist provision that allows for referenda to overturn council’s decisions to establish Māori wards.</li>
<li>Establish a Parliamentary Commissioner for Te Tiriti o Waitangi to provide oversight of the Crown.</li>
</ol>

<p>These demands are contained in the Māori Party Mana Motuhake policy.</p>
<p>“Article 1 of Te Tiriti awarded custodianship to the Crown,” Tamihere said. “We have never gave up ownership. Article 2 gave Māori the right to total control of all their domains, including land and water and Article 3 asserted that Māori would be treated equally with non-Maori”.</p>
<p>“That is certainly not the case in 2020 New Zealand.”</p>
<p>Released at the Waitangi Treaty Grounds, where Northern Māori signed the founding document with the Crown, was a fitting place for the Māori Party to release one of its flagship policies.</p>
<p>“We all want what was contracted for in Te Tiriti to be delivered.”</p>
