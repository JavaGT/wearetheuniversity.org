<p><strong>Monday, 21 September 2020, 3:51 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Green Party is calling for Waka Kotahi the NZ Transport Agency to convert a lane over the Auckland Harbour Bridge to bus-only and make buses free to use across the bridge until all lanes are back in operation.</p>
<p>Green Party transport spokesperson Julie Anne Genter says “a dedicated bus lane can carry <a href="https://nacto.org/publication/transit-street-design-guide/introduction/why/designing-move-people/">about seven times more people</a> than a single car lane, so has the potential to help thousands more people cross the bridge without facing any congestion at all.</p>
<p>“Already buses can bypass congestion via the busway all the way from Albany, but buses are being massively delayed when they have to merge into general traffic on the bridge.</p>
<p>“A bus lane during the morning and evening peak hour will allow thousands of Auckland commuters to bypass the congestion.</p>
<p>“Making public transport free for this short period will also encourage some reluctant bus users to leave their car at home.</p>
<p>“This will help free-up space on the road for people that have no other option but to drive.</p>
<p>“Long term, the Greens support a second harbour crossing in the form of a rail line connecting the CBD to Takapuna and Albany.</p>
<p>“A rail crossing will give thousands of people the freedom to leave the car at home, bypass traffic congestion, and get to the city quickly.</p>
<p>“Under this Government, work has already starting on planning, design and protecting the route for a second harbour crossing.</p>

<p>“We don’t support another road crossing as it is forecast to funnel <a href="https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/projects/awhc/docs/BRI-1270-awhc-transport-modelling.pdf">an additional 5,400 cars</a> into and through the city in the morning peak, worsening congestion and climate pollution.”</p>
<p>The Green Party will be putting out its complete transport policy next week.</p>
