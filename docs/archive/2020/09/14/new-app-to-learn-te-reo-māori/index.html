<p><strong>Monday, 14 September 2020, 1:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology">Auckland University of Technology</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Kia kaha te kōrero Māori</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be diligent at speaking Māori</strong></p>
<p>A free app that teaches how to use te reo Māori in real life situations is now available for download.</p>
<p>Kōrerorero, has been in development at the Auckland University of Technology for the past two years.</p>
<p>Although it is designed for beginners, the new phone app is also a great tool for those who would like to brush up on their language skills, says Hēmi Kelly, AUT Lecturer and co-creator of the app.</p>
<p>“From the first lesson there are words that you can use immediately,” Kelly says.</p>
<p>“It’s so user friendly that anyone can use it, even the kids – which means the whole whānau can learn together.”</p>
<p>Users of the free app work their way through Kōrerorero’s eight lessons, each based around a different activity one would find in a typical day. Each lesson contains up to 10 parts with a series of interactive exercises.</p>
<p>“It focuses on spoken reo rather than written language. It is cohesive and designed with repetition,” Kelly says.</p>
<p>Kōrerorero is a collaborative effort between Te Ara Poutama (AUT’s Faculty of Māori and Indigenous Development) and the AUT Learning Transformation LAB (altLAB).</p>
<p>Te Ara Poutama lead the creation of the app’s content and provided the cultural support and knowledge while altLAB&#39;s Digital Media Team lead the app&#39;s design, development, and distribution.</p>
<p>App co-creator Professor Hinematau McNeill says staff and their whānau gave a lot of free time engaging in project development, providing voiceovers and photography, and reviewing lessons for user-friendliness.</p>

<p>“The technical expertise and support provided by altLAB also went above and beyond,” she says. “It’s a testament to their support for te reo.”</p>
<p>Kōrerorero has been extensively tested, going through two cycles of content, functionality and usability testing. The te reo Māori taught has also been carefully reviewed.</p>
<p>The general public, tertiary institutes and school can use it alongside their curriculum, Professor McNeill says.</p>
<p>“We hope that Kōrerorero will be useful in helping to revitalise the reo in Aotearoa,” she says.</p>
<p>“That it is being made available at no cost to the learner accentuates AUT’s commitment to Māori and te reo.”</p>
<p>Courses in te reo Māori are also offered at AUT’s Te Ara Poutama.</p>
<p>Kōrerorero is available for free download at both the Apple App Store, and Google Play.</p>
