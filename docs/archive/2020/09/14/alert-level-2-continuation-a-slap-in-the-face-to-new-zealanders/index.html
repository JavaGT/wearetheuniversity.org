<p><strong>Monday, 14 September 2020, 1:24 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“Keeping New Zealand at Alert Level 2 shows the Government has failed at its Covid-19 response,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government says it has done a great job, and we must stay locked down. They cannot have it both ways. Either the Government has failed, or the restrictions can be lifted.</p>
<p>“Six months into this epidemic, the only tool the Government has is lockdowns. This approach is not sustainable</p>
<p>“New Zealanders are understandably becoming increasingly frustrated at the rules and restrictions they’re facing because the Government didn’t go hard or early enough.</p>
<p>“New Zealand was a 60th country in the world to have Covid-19 arrive, we had 102 days of being Covid free to improve our response and it took the Government 192 days to require border staff be tested.</p>
<p>“The restrictions on the South Island are particularly harsh. There hasn’t been any community transition there in the latest outbreak, but they’ve been unable to go about their daily lives.</p>
<p>“Many in the hospitality business are allowed to open but cannot make money doing so. It is death by two thousand cuts. A thousand last lockdown and another thousand now.</p>
<p>“There should have been a crowd for South Canterbury vs North Otago at the weekend. The Government has repeatedly told us a strong health approach would lead to an open economy and yet Auckland had to endure another lockdown and we’ve missed out on the Rugby Championship.</p>
<p>ACT’s approach learns from Taiwan and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Zealand Epidemic Response Unit: Based on Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Centre</li>
<li>Government as referee, not player: Allow alternative facilities for safe, electronically-monitored isolation, with strict punishment for rule-breakers</li>
<li>Risk-weighted: Treat different countries and travellers with different levels of caution</li>
<li>Technology-driven: Such as COVID card, ëlarm, rapid tests, temperature checks and thermal cameras</li>
<li>Continuous improvement: Constantly compare ourselves with the best and seek to strengthen our resistance.</li>
</ul>
<p>“If we want to enhance New Zealanders’ overall wellbeing, we must get a lot smarter. A Party Vote for ACT is a vote to tackle COVID-19 intelligently.”</p>
