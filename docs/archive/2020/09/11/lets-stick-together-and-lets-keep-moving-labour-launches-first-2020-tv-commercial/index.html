<p><strong>Friday, 11 September 2020, 2:22 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<h2>Megan Woods</h2>
<h2>Labour Campaign Chair</h2>
<p>Labour has launched its first TV commercial for the 2020 election.</p>
<p>The advert was released exclusively to Labour’s online supporters this afternoon.</p>
<p>“We’ve done things a little differently this year, and have launched our commercial first to our grassroots supporters, ahead of it being aired on TV and social media. This is a people powered campaign, made possible by thousands of volunteers around the country, and it only felt right that they saw our commercial first,” Megan Woods said.</p>
<p>“This year, our television campaign is about getting our message of progress in front of New Zealanders - we went hard and early to stamp out the virus, but to rebuild the economy we need a strong plan and the trusted leadership of Jacinda Ardern.</p>
<p>“Our plan is centred around creating new jobs with infrastructure and environment projects, making apprenticeships free, backing businesses and growing trade with targeted support.</p>
<p>“Our ad features the Prime Minister laying out this plan directly to New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“Thanks to the great work of our team of 5 million, we are in a better position to move ahead with the economic recovery. Now, we need to stick together, and keep New Zealand moving in the right direction,” says Megan Woods.</p>
