<p><strong>Friday, 11 September 2020, 9:17 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT Leader David Seymour has challenged other party leaders to show New Zealanders their path to surplus.</p>
<p>“Labour is borrowing $5.7 million an hour to fund its spending splurge. That’s totally unsustainable. Party leaders need to front up with their plans for getting on top of out-of-control spending and debt.</p>
<p>“It’s the kids at intermediate school right now who’ll lose. By the time they start paying tax, we’ll be spending more on interest repayments than the entire education budget.</p>
<p>“They’ll be asking, ‘what the hell were you thinking?,’ about Jacinda Ardern’s decision give a multi-millionaire bungee jump operator $10 million, and the Greens’ $12 million for a school where students learned about the healing power of crystals.</p>
<p>“Every extra dollar of borrowing means higher taxes or fewer services tomorrow because of politicians’ irresponsibility today. Borrowing now and forgetting tomorrow is fiscal child abuse.</p>
<p>“It’s astonishing that no other party has any kind of serious plan to get back to surplus and begin repaying the debt.</p>
<p>“Labour won’t begin to pay down debt until at least 2028.</p>
<p>“National is promising to spend billions more, and many of its policies are uncosted.</p>
<p>“The Greens plan to introduce a $12 billion benefit for every person regardless of need.</p>
<p>“It’s time for all political leaders to step up and be transparent about their plans.</p>
<p>“Only ACT has a fully costed plan to get back to surplus by reducing wasteful spending and start repaying the debt now.”</p>
