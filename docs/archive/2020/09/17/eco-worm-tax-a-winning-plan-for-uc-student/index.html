<p><strong>Thursday, 17 September 2020, 9:21 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>A plan to introduce a unique eco-tax on waste has won a University of Canterbury (UC) Business student a virtual place at an international conference.</p>
<p>UC Masters in Business Management student Yutika Rangari created a poster explaining her plan to levy the industrial and residential sector $40 per tonne of solid waste and entered the TaxCOOP2020 Go Green contest.</p>
<p>She is one of five finalists to be chosen from entries around the world.</p>
<p>The jury described Yutika’s proposal as innovative and realistic. She won a CA$1000 cash prize and her poster will be shared during the TaxCOOP2020 World Tax Summit in Montreal, Canada.</p>
<p>Rangari has also been invited to take part in a series of brainstorming sessions on the subject at the summit, which is being held virtually this year, from October 13 to 15.</p>
<p>Yutika, who has a Masters in Biotechnology Research from India, wanted to use her science background and her Business Management knowledge to come up with a taxation-based solution to New Zealand’s waste problem.</p>
<p>“Among all OECD countries, New Zealand has the highest amount of landfill and the lowest recycling of solid waste, according to Ministry for the Environment figures.</p>
<p>“About 60 per cent of New Zealand’s landfill waste could be recycled, including 39 per cent organic matter and 19 per cent paper.”</p>
<p>Revenue raised from the eco-tax would be used for waste minimisation activities around the country, such as organic compost plants, she says.</p>

<p>Her plan is to convert the excess solid waste into beneficial vermicompost (worm compost) through vermiculture so she has called the concept a “Vermi-Greeno Tax”.</p>
<p>She is thrilled to have won the contest with the idea.</p>
<p>“I’m really, really proud that I did it. It’s all worth it and I’m so proud to be involved in the conference on behalf of UC. I think it will be extremely intellectual and a learning experience.”</p>
<p>Yutika arrived in New Zealand in January and began studying at UC in February.</p>
<p>She says the style of teaching is different to what she experienced in India. “It’s very interactive at UC, we get to participate a lot.</p>
<p>“I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Stephen Hickson, Director Business Taught Masters, for his guidance and motivation.”</p>
