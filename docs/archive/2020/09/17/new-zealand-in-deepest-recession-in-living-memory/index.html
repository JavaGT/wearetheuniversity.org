<p><strong>Thursday, 17 September 2020, 11:32 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The economic numbers today are proof that this Government has failed to keep our economy progressing, National’s Finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>Stats NZ confirmed today New Zealand’s economy shrunk by 12.2 per cent following a 1.4 per cent drop in the first quarter. This compares with 7 per cent and 0.3 per cent in Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers reveal a smaller economy with thousands of Kiwis out of work, businesses failing and a massive drop in New Zealand’s income.</p>
<p>“The lack of pragmatism and a clear plan from Labour has made the economic hole deeper and the impact harder than it needed to be.</p>
<p>“This economic damage was recorded in three months but will last for decades to come.</p>
<p>“This is the deepest recession in living memory. It is already having a devastating impact on Kiwi families. An extra 70,000 New Zealanders have lost their job since March, and a further 100,000 are forecast to lose their jobs in the next two years.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is looking at a longer, more painful economic crisis than earlier forecast. There is a better way, it requires a serious growth plan to get us back on track.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders have a choice for our economic recovery: more government programmes, welfare and costs for business under Labour; or lower taxes, more business investment and investing in quality infrastructure under National.</p>
<p>“Our economic plan of job-friendly policies and investment in quality infrastructure will grow our economy, give businesses the confidence to grow and restore household incomes for New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“National will release our fiscal plan tomorrow, which will carefully balance the need to inject stimulus, increase investment in core public services and restore government debt back to prudent levels.”</p>
