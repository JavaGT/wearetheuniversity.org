<p><strong>Wednesday, 30 September 2020, 1:35 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZEI">NZEI</a></strong></p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa is welcoming the Government’s commitment of additional counselling and advice services for educators in early learning services and schools, especially in the current Covid environment.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa President, Liam Rutherford, says educators will greatly benefit from further access to counselling services and a support network.</p>
<p>“Educators have worked extremely hard to support students and their learning through this difficult year. We know that teacher workload and a lack of resourcing was already a huge strain for educators, but the adjustments they’ve had to make due to Covid has further compounded these stress levels.”</p>
<p>“While we welcome the extra funding, we know that to truly address teacher wellbeing we need to fix the underlying causes of stress – which are workload and resourcing for the sector.”</p>
<p>The package announced today includes funding for additional EAP advice and workshops for educators, a focus on regions further impacted by Covid-19, funding for an online wellbeing hub for educators as well as funding solely for the Māori education workforce in Māori medium educational settings.</p>
