<p><strong>Saturday, 19 September 2020, 11:46 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“Labour isn’t just cutting open the golden goose, they’re wringing its neck”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“Two days after we found out that New Zealand is in the deepest recession in living memory, Labour is piling on red tape and compliance costs.</p>
<p>“The last thing businesses can afford right now is to raise the minimum wage and pay out more leave. Whoever forms the next Government has a responsibility to support our businesses to recover, not kick them while they’re down.</p>
<p>“This is all against the backdrop of what will be a long and fragile recovery from the biggest GDP drop in New Zealand history.</p>
<p>“For a recovery to happen, one New Zealander has to decide to employ another, hundreds of thousands of times over in the coming years. This policy tips the scales away from recovery.</p>
<p>“There is no evidence that people are being forced to work while sick. We can only assume this policy is being driven by the unions who back Labour.</p>
<p>“Labour doesn’t understand small business. It’s only interested in helping its union mates.</p>
<p>“ACT has a plan to recover the economy. We would put a three-year moratorium on raising the minimum wage and reinstate 90-day trials for all businesses.</p>
<p>“ACT has a fully-costed plan for economic recovery, which keeps the debt low, cuts taxes, and gets the country back to surplus, while keeping Kiwis in work.”</p>
