<p><strong>Wednesday, 22 July 2020, 1:56 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>“Tens of thousands of jobs are on the line as Labour sits on its hands over the shovel-ready project scheme,” National Party Leader Judith Collins said today.</p>
<p>Ms Collins said councils and communities had worked hard through the first two weeks of April to put forward hundreds of shovel-ready projects before Labour’s tight 14 April deadline.</p>
<p>More than three months after that deadline, Labour has agreed to just 30 projects going ahead. This is despite Labour’s Grant Robertson saying in mid-May that the full list be would unveiled “within weeks”.</p>
<p>“Labour never delivers,” Ms Collins said.</p>
<p>“Over 200,000 Kiwis are now receiving the unemployment benefit and more than 200,000 construction workers received the wage subsidy.</p>
<p>“Those 200,000 construction workers and their families need every shovel-ready project that meets the criteria to be funded right now if they are to be certain of keeping their jobs when the wage subsidy scheme ends in just a few weeks.</p>
<p>“The industry is screaming out for the work, to get the diggers moving. The delays cannot continue.</p>
<p>“Labour must release the full list of shovel-ready projects today, so that the construction industry can give certainty to those 200,000 families whose livelihoods are at risk. Labour must not keep the list secret another day longer.</p>
<p>“National has a comprehensive vision and plan to deliver infrastructure for New Zealand. National knows what it takes to get the diggers moving.”</p>
