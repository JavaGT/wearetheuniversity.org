<p><strong>Monday, 20 July 2020, 2:18 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>“Today I spoke to National Party Leader Judith Collins to inform her I will not be contesting the upcoming election.</p>
<p>“As I noted in my maiden speech three years ago, when I was younger I lost three close friends to suicide. It was an extremely difficult period in my life. Unfortunately, recently, another friend took their own life, which has brought back much unresolved grief.</p>
<p>“I have made a number of mistakes and I apologise to those who have been affected.</p>
<p>“Recent events have compounded that situation and reminded me of the need to maintain my own health and wellbeing. I have again been receiving counselling.</p>
<p>“I want to thank Judith for her support during this time and I look forward to helping a new candidate in the Rangitata electorate in any way I can.</p>
<p>“I apologise for this disruption to my colleagues and to those I serve in Mid and South Canterbury.”</p>
