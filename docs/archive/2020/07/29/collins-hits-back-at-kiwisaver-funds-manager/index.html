<p><strong>Wednesday, 29 July 2020, 4:03 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National Leader Judith Collins has hit back at funds manager Rupert Carlyon of Kōura Wealth KiwiSaver, for his criticisms of National’s BusinessStart plan, which allow Kiwis to access $20,000 of their own money to start a new business.</p>
<p>“I’d like Rupert to tell New Zealanders why they shouldn’t use their own money to invest in their own business,” Ms Collins said.</p>
<p>“Rupert is only the first fee-charging funds manager to tell Kiwis who intend starting a new business that he knows how to invest their money better than they do.</p>
<p>“National believes Kiwis put money into KiwiSaver for a rainy day. That rainy day has well and truly arrived for the hundreds of thousands of Kiwis whose jobs risk being lost over the months ahead.</p>
<p>“BusinessStart is about Kiwis who lose their jobs being able to draw $20,000 from their KiwiSaver accounts and receive another $10,000 in tax credits to get their own small business off the ground – and JobStart gives them another $10,000 when they create a job for someone else.</p>
<p>“BusinessStart then includes further tax breaks to strongly encourage BusinessStart recipients to replenish their KiwiSaver accounts as soon as possible after being involved in the job-creation programme.</p>
<p>“The effect is like you borrowing from your own KiwiSaver fund as you face the biggest financial crisis of your life.</p>
<p>“BusinessStart is not compulsory – it’s for Kiwis with an idea that their accountant or financial adviser has professionally assessed can be made to fly.</p>

<p>“Fund managers like Rupert should remember that the Kiwis who use BusinessStart don’t have a job and can’t contribute to their funds, or any other fund.</p>
<p>“They should also remember that everyone who has a private-sector job only has it because someone, somewhere, had the guts to set up a new business.</p>
<p>“National believes in choice, personal responsibility and backs Kiwis to make their decisions about their money.”</p>
<p>BusinessStart and JobStart will be open for 17 months after the election, from 1 November 2020 to 31 March 2022.</p>
