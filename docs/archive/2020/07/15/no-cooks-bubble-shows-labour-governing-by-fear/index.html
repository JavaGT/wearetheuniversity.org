<p><strong>Wednesday, 15 July 2020, 10:41 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“The <a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=UvCCd8GcsmKKe6vGMpaWv66N4MBebx1Y56BVb9RTnSnQKJ9zWKrigQvwCt0oK4N9t_h9afL64ZiisWxrXCkyHR3ai9RNECHd97VwbqnlJxQ&e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=cooks_bubble_fear&n=2">lack of progress</a> on a travel bubble with a Covid-free part of New Zealand shows Labour will govern by fear until 19 September,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“Despite the fact there’s no community transmission in either region, Jacinda Ardern continues to reject the possibility of a travel bubble.</p>
<p>“There’s a simple reason. Until 19 September, the Government will govern for the Labour Party, taking zero risks, and keeping New Zealanders in a state of fear.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders would like to travel. The Cooks need our tourism dollars. It’s a simple, safe, win-win proposition. A travel bubble could happen tomorrow. The Government could make the trip a domestic flight.</p>
<p>“When FDR said, ‘the only thing we have to fear, is fear itself’ he could have been talking about our election. New Zealanders are being given a daily dose of fear with tacit demands for gratitude. We’re told it’s dangerous to even talk about our long-term plan.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister told us tens of thousands would die. It’s now clear that was questionable at best.</p>
<p>“Our approach must shift from fear to practicality. Labour needs to stop preaching fear, and ask what we can do, not what we can’t do.</p>

<p>“COVID-19 will be with us for a while at least. But it is not the only danger we face. Instead of a state of fear, we need a state of open debate.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders need to reconnect safely with the world, but they’re currently being gripped by the state of fear that the Government created as a management tool. Every time there’s a Government mistake, the ratchet tightens, and opportunity gets tougher.</p>
<p>“A different future is possible. With everyone working together in a climate of possibility instead of fear, we could turn our good luck into good management.</p>
<p>“We must end government by fear and groupthink. Instead of wrapping ourselves in cotton wool, we need to be resilient in a post-COVID-19 world.</p>
<p>“The next government will need to peer into the future, confront our problems strategically, and lead the world in public health with an open, transparent, tech-savvy approach.”</p>
