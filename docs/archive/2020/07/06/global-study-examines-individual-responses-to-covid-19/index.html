<p><strong>Monday, 6 July 2020, 9:09 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>A global study is under way to compare how information about Covid-19 is delivered by authorities and the media, and how it is understood and used by people in different countries.</p>
<p>University of Canterbury (UC) population health expert Professor Philip Schluter is the New Zealand lead for the project, which aims to survey 1000 people in each of eight countries: Canada, United States, England, Hong Kong, Philippines, Switzerland, Belgium and New Zealand. The project will explore responses from the eight countries with different governance, sociocultural contexts and experiences of managing Covid-19.</p>
<p>“It’s very exciting, not only because it is a truly international study, but particularly in respect to the communications, media and social media aspects of it,” he says.</p>
<p>Well known in international public health, Professor Schluter contributes to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Thematic Platform for Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management Research Network, and is a contributing author for the upcoming book <em>WHO Guidance on Research Methods for Health-Emergency and Disaster Risk Management</em>.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Government earned praise for its quick action and clear communications on Covid-19 that achieved zero community transmission of new cases, however recent arrivals to the country have exposed flaws in the managed isolation/quarantine system.</p>
<p>“Two weeks ago I would have said that the trust in our government’s information was quite good. It has changed overnight and it is hard to predict where it will go, but I think we have fared better in New Zealand than other countries. My colleagues in the United States are quite fearful,” he says.</p>
<p>“On social media, I know that there has been a lot of information going around and a lot of misinformation about the origins of the pandemic, so the extent to which that is influencing people in different countries will be interesting.”</p>
<p>The global project, led by a research team based in Université de Sherbrooke Canada, is also exploring the psychosocial impacts of Covid-19. Professor Schluter will be able to compare this data to research gathered from Christchurch following the earthquakes, and to see whether Christchurch has been more impacted by Covid-19 than the rest of New Zealand.  
 </p>
<p>In Christchurch, Professor Schluter is the academic lead on a wellbeing project started by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) and subsequently passed on to and continued by the Canterbury District Health Board (CDHB).</p>
<p>Professor Schluter has published over 245 peer-reviewed articles in national and international journals and provides expert review to multiple high-ranking international journals including <em>Lancet, BMJ, Paediatrics, Psychological Methods, Addiction, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,</em> and <em>Medical Journal of Australia</em>. He has led or been a named investigator on 60 successful competitive grants in Australia and New Zealand totalling $25.8 million.</p>
