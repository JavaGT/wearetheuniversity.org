<p><strong>Saturday, 18 July 2020, 4:22 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>NZ Steel is now the third large industrial company, with high numbers of employed staff, to go into a strategic review, with one of the significant contributing factors being Government regulation, says Jonathan Young, National Energy &amp; Resources spokesperson.</p>
<p>NZ Aluminium Smelter and Refining NZ are both under strategic review.</p>
<p>The Government’s ban on new oil and gas exploration permits does nothing to ensure we have a strong supply of competitively priced natural gas, and that tightness in the market is further driving up the cost of electricity, says Young.</p>
<p>The Government’s recent ETS reforms also put significant cost pressures on companies which produce essential commodities like steel. While this is the design of the reforms to place a higher price on carbon, if companies like NZ Steel close, their production will most likely be replaced by overseas companies with higher levels of emissions; and all we would’ve achieved is exporting thousands of jobs, as well as having to rely on overseas companies to now supply New Zealand’s needs.</p>
<p>Apart from increased emissions in production because most overseas steel mills rely on coal-fired generation for their electricity; shipping transport will see emissions, with the planet being worse off.</p>
<p>National asked the Government to delay the introduction of their ETS reforms for a further year, so our companies can get through the economic downturn created by the Covid-19 crisis. The Government refused our request and we now see another large employing company coming under strategic review because of the regulatory uncertainty this government has created.</p>
<p>With so much uncertainty in the world economy, we need a sensible pathway to a lower emissions economy, one that still keeps Kiwis in their jobs.</p>
