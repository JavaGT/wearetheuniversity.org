<p><strong>Saturday, 30 May 2020, 11:31 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“A wave of economic destruction is approaching the country, and, with just one active Covid-19 case remaining, the Prime Minister must explain why she continues to wait to ease remaining restrictions on the economy,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=eTi2K5XcRrlm_yPWf-A_jL_EvgB_vDXWhhWUplSJNf9hBDWZJeCKZ64I_66xABu75YAuegoXYlYf3Q04As666-rJPLuW39_eYvei0Po1RSo&e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=move_to_al1&n=2">Stats NZ said on Thursday</a> that 37,500 jobs were lost in April alone, the biggest monthly fall in percentage terms in at least two decades.</p>
<p>“The job losses we’re seeing may already be <a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=UvCCd8GcsmKKe6vGMpaWv5Ale5F0cKeyqxejb3m6Sok79KYPs388mYVBTLbwgOPJNfJw_R2o83H9G25mK5HS991AfSdHGs-O_L3b4Akot5M&e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=move_to_al1&n=3">worse than those felt during the Global Financial Crisis</a>.</p>
<p>“That’s tens of thousands of New Zealand families no longer able to provide for themselves and instead having to rely on welfare.</p>
<p>“The Reserve Bank says we are headed for the biggest fall in economic growth in 160 years.</p>
<p>“The human consequences of the recession will be staggering.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, we have just a single active case of Covid-19 left in the country. New Zealand has had seven days in a row without a new case. <a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=5YJMdUwSRqRR5OtSoDZ3PUpYq6XzyNGp7wOWE4TwljXZNMzIzTDG-RRY_DKlYBS8h9lX8Pe5rvXR4V3pAy0T7ESN9E3NWhIfaHut0eAwQZGwN9__6npAEBs-o-WYvGYcoMO2agAf2fAVSwO-h4hkKsTXHLxppMwtglLGn_Z4N0iA3iQzgJxzicmE6fEuDwOO&e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=move_to_al1&n=4">The last case of community transmission was in early April</a>, nearly four transmission cycles ago.</p>
<p>“The data shows we have beaten the virus. We’re now attempting to squash a flea with a sledgehammer.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister must tell New Zealanders, specifically, what it will take to move us to Alert Level 1.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders have made enormous sacrifices over the past two months. The people deserve to know what further sacrifices are necessary.</p>
<p>“In the absence of a compelling case to keep remaining restrictions in place, on Monday the Cabinet should make the decision to move New Zealand to Alert Level 1 as soon as possible.”</p>
