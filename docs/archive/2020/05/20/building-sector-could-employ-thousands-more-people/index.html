<p><strong>Wednesday, 20 May 2020, 10:08 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Government needs to unleash the construction sector’s ability to create thousands of jobs, National’s Building and Construction spokesperson Andrew Bayly says.</p>
<p>“The building and construction industry offers one of the best opportunities for rejuvenating our economy because it employs a large number of New Zealanders, and many of its products are sourced locally.</p>
<p>“Spending money wisely on projects that deliver good value and employ more people is vital, but we risk not achieving those objectives in the rush to deliver shovel-ready projects.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest issues confronting the sector is consenting. Kāinga Ora has the ability to fast-track its own build programme with little or no involvement from councils but the Government has done little to address consenting delays across the rest of the sector.</p>
<p>“The Government must deal with the wider issues across our construction sector rather than just providing bespoke solutions for its own government agencies.</p>
<p>To maximise the construction sector’s potential, National would also like to see:</p>
<p>· Greater use of technology, such as the <em>Artisan</em> app developed by BRANZ, to reduce the number of physical inspections during building work as it occurs</p>
<p>· Advance spending on government projects, particularly in provincial areas</p>
<p>· Greater support and innovative funding for new building projects, such as providing some form of underwriting of material costs for new developments</p>
<p>“It’s vital the Government places sufficient weight on the domestic building and construction sector rather than engaging overseas firms for projects that employ few New Zealanders and see revenues head overseas.”</p>
