<p><strong>Wednesday, 13 May 2020, 2:56 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Figures from the Reserve Bank today estimating there will be 150,000 job losses over the next six months, highlights why it’s crucial we have a clear strategy to guide New Zealand out of this economic hole, National’s Finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>“This is a devastating prediction and emphasises the very real need for a Government with a credible economic plan to steer New Zealand through.</p>
<p>“We must do everything we can to reduce the economic damage, by allowing Kiwis to get back to work as soon as they can.</p>
<p>“Restrictions, even at Level 2 and Level 1, will make it harder for many businesses to operate profitably and will cost more jobs.</p>
<p>“These figures come on top of the 1000 people a day who have gone on to the unemployment benefit during lockdown.</p>
<p>“Thousands more people joining the dole queue will make it much harder for those people to pay their mortgage, put food on the table or pay their bills.</p>
<p>“We know big spending will be needed in tomorrow’s Budget to support businesses and save jobs but we must not dig the hole deeper than it needs to be.</p>
<p>“The Government needs to carefully consider every spending decision they make because every cent will have to be paid off with higher taxes and by future generations.</p>
<p>“National has a plan to rebuild our economy and a track record of managing New Zealand through times of economic crisis.</p>
