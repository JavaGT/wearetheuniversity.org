<p><strong>Tuesday, 5 May 2020, 12:35 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Leader of the Opposition Simon Bridges has today announced the first part of National’s plan for getting New Zealand working again.</p>
<p>“New Zealand has flattened the curve. Our first priority now must be to lift the restrictions that are flattening the economy.</p>
<p>“We need to get cash flowing to the thousands of small businesses that were forced to close in the national interest, and left shouldering a disproportionate amount of the economic burden.</p>
<p>“To reduce the damage and to save jobs, National would offer a GST cash refund of up to $100,000 – based off the GST they paid in the 6 months to 1 January 2020 - to the small businesses most affected. They would need to demonstrate a revenue drop of more than 50 per cent across two successive months due to the lockdown rules.</p>
<p>“We estimate this could benefit up to 160,000 businesses and save countless jobs.</p>
<p>“If the business paid more than $100,000 in GST over that period, then they would be able to claim up to an additional $250,000 as a repayable loan over 5 years.</p>
<p>“National understands the key to growing the economy is to encourage and incentivise business investment.</p>
<p>“That’s why we would temporarily lift the threshold to expense new capital investment for firms. The Government lifted the threshold from $500 to $5000 as part of its Covid response. We’d go much further and lift it to $150,000 for two years.</p>
<p>For example, if a company spends $145,000 on a new machine to improve its productivity, rather than depreciating that asset over many years, it will be able to expense the full $145,000 in this tax year.</p>

<p>“What we do in the next few months is critical to help businesses survive and save jobs.</p>
<p>“The Government took the right steps to contain the virus but already it’s stalling on what to do next.</p>
<p>“National will work alongside New Zealanders to achieve jobs, sustainable growth and boundless opportunities for New Zealanders and their families.</p>
<p>“Kiwis have done a great job self-isolating and social distancing to save lives. But with 1000 people a day joining the dole queue, we now need to turn our attention to saving jobs.</p>
<p>“National will get New Zealand working again.”</p>
