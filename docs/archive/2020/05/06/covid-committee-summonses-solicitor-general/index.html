<p><strong>Wednesday, 6 May 2020, 9:38 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>In an unprecedented move, the Epidemic Response Committee has agreed to issue summonses to the Solicitor-General, the Director-General of Health and Police Commissioner seeking the legal advice for the lockdown, Opposition Leader and Committee Chair Simon Bridges says.</p>
<p>“All legal advice on the legality of lockdown and ongoing restrictions has been sought.</p>
<p>“It’s inexplicable that the advice hasn’t been made public when New Zealanders have made so many sacrifices complying with the strict lockdown rules.</p>
<p>“National has asked repeatedly and publicly for this information for the past five weeks.</p>
<p>“Serious concerns have also been raised by academics, lawyers and the Law Society.</p>
<p>“Parliament has never before summonsed the Solicitor-General.</p>
<p>“The people of New Zealand have given up their freedoms for this lockdown. We all deserve to know what the legal basis was for that.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders should be proud of the efforts they’ve made during this lockdown but they also deserve to know whether the lockdown was legal.”</p>
