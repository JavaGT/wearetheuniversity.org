<p><strong>Tuesday, 28 April 2020, 8:35 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Council_of_Trade_Unions">Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p>Today, 28th of April, is Worker’s Memorial Day. &quot;We must all take responsibility for better health and safety at work in New Zealand. 100 working people were killed in workplaces in the last year,&quot; said Council of Trade Unions President Richard Wagstaff. &quot;It is a sombre reflection that today we also open up many workplaces under COVID-19 level 3, and the health and safety of working people is on everyone’s mind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; At midday today, union members across New Zealand and the world, will be taking a minute to light a candle and remember the 100 people killed in workplaces, 100 lives too many.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We also turn our minds to the international theme of Worker’s Memorial Day, which is ‘Stop the Pandemic at Work’, timely for the re-opening of many worksites under the cloud of COVID -19. We know that internationally there have been thousands of working people exposed. Hundreds of those working in healthcare around the world have died at work trying to save others.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In New Zealand, we are proud that our ‘go hard go early’ lockdown has prevented any workplace exposure deaths from COVID-19. We should be taking the same attitude to all health and safety risks at work. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Council of Trade Unions will today be <a href="http://www.together.org.nz/level-3-survey">surveying</a> those who went back to the work site today about whether the <a href="http://www.together.org.nz/stay_safe_at_level_3">’10 checks for a safe return to work’</a> have been followed. Alert Level 3 is no return to ‘business as usual’ for health and safety. Let the Level 3 re-opening be the reset button we need to treat every workplace risk with the same level of caution we will for COVID-19 - there is no reason any Kiwi should be killed at work,&quot; Wagstaff said.</p>
