<p><strong>Tuesday, 28 April 2020, 2:12 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZEI">NZEI</a></strong></p>
<p>Now that more than 500,000 vulnerable Kiwis and key healthcare workers have received the seasonal flu vaccine, NZEI Te Riu Roa says a priority vaccination programme needs to be set up for educators returning to classrooms and early education services.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa President Liam Rutherford says the small bubbles in schools and centres under Level 3 could be expanded to include most staff and children in as little as two weeks when the move to Level 2 is made .</p>
<p>&quot;It makes sense to protect all teachers and support staff - and their students and tamariki - from seasonal flu. Even with careful social distancing and strict school bubbles they will have some of the closest and most prolonged contact of any workers,&quot; says Mr Rutherford.</p>
<p>&quot;Any outbreak of respiratory illness in a school or centre would cause a lot of alarm and disruption until Covid-19 could be ruled out. So as our educators move to the front line in the reopening of Aotearoa, we&#39;re calling on the Government to vaccinate teachers and support staff as a priority.&quot;</p>
