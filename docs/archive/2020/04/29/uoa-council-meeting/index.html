<p><em>00:00</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> All of our Council members are here. Are there any disclosures of interest by any members?</p>
<p><em>00:10</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> I&#39;ll</p>
<p><em>00:10</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> take that as a no and we will record that. So we will move to item 3 which is the confirmative degrees and you will have noted for obvious reasons it&#39;s a slightly longer list. It&#39;s by the authority vested in me by resolution of the University of Auckland Council, I Scott St John</p>
<p><em>00:30</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> and conferred the degree stated upon those who within their several faculties have satisfied the requirements of this university.</p>
<p><em>00:38</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> And</p>
<p><em>00:38</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> we will move similarly to the award of diplomas. By the authority vested in me by resolution of the University of Auckland Council, I, Scott St John Chancellor, award the diplomas stated to those who within their several faculties have satisfied the requirements of this university.</p>
<p><em>01:00</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> So that done, we will deal with the Minutes Part A from the meeting of 16 March, which seems like an eternity ago, but we&#39;re all sitting face to face. Then, has anyone got any comments on those Minutes?</p>
<p><em>01:24</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> So</p>
<p><em>01:25</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> we will take them as a fair and accurate view.</p>
<p><em>01:30</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> I will move. Can someone second please?</p>
<p><em>01:33</em>
I&#39;m</p>
<p><em>01:34</em>
<em>Speaker 2:</em> happy to Scott, Cathy.</p>
<p><em>01:35</em>
Thanks,</p>
<p><em>01:36</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> Cathy. All those in favour, say aye. Aye. Aye. Against. Carried. So we will now move to the Vice-Chancellor&#39;s report. Dawn, we welcome you.</p>
<p><em>02:00</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> Thank you Chancellor and</p>
<p><em>02:02</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> hello</p>
<p><em>02:03</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> to everyone</p>
<p><em>02:03</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> who</p>
<p><em>02:04</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> is not visible on the screen.</p>
<p><em>02:07</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> What</p>
<p><em>02:08</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> I&#39;d like to do is I&#39;ll just talk through some of the highlights in the report and I may also ask Adrian to comment</p>
<p><em>02:15</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> on</p>
<p><em>02:16</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> one or two of the items that are contained. It&#39;s quite a lengthy report so I&#39;m taking it as read.</p>
<p><em>02:23</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> I</p>
<p><em>02:23</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> want to start by acknowledging the outstanding achievement that was announced</p>
<p><em>02:30</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> last week for the university to remain and retain</p>
<p><em>02:33</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> its</p>
<p><em>02:34</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> number one slot</p>
<p><em>02:35</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> as</p>
<p><em>02:36</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the university leading on the sustainable development goals</p>
<p><em>02:39</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> through</p>
<p><em>02:40</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the times higher education rankings. It&#39;s a significant achievement to retain that</p>
<p><em>02:46</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> ranking,</p>
<p><em>02:47</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> not least because of the increase in numbers of universities that submitted in a whole range of areas. So I want to start by acknowledging that and congratulating all of the staff that have been involved in</p>
<p><em>03:00</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> that achievement to date and of course we retain it for a year</p>
<p><em>03:03</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> so</p>
<p><em>03:04</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> please feel free to talk about it and to continue to</p>
<p><em>03:08</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> get</p>
<p><em>03:09</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> behind that achievement wherever you can in whatever forum you can.</p>
<p><em>03:12</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> The</p>
<p><em>03:13</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> other thing I&#39;d just like to acknowledge in this report is that you&#39;ll see that we&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p><em>03:18</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> quite</p>
<p><em>03:18</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> extensively include the work of the PVC</p>
<p><em>03:21</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> Pacific so</p>
<p><em>03:23</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> Damon has now started to infuse</p>
<p><em>03:26</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the</p>
<p><em>03:27</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> work of this strategy throughout</p>
<p><em>03:30</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> number of the KPIs and we&#39;re seeing those throughout the report and I&#39;ll refer to some of those</p>
<p><em>03:35</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> as</p>
<p><em>03:36</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> we go through.</p>
<p><em>03:37</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> So</p>
<p><em>03:38</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> I&#39;m going to just pick out, I&#39;m not going to focus too much on</p>
<p><em>03:42</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the</p>
<p><em>03:42</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> health and safety highlights. Of course we&#39;re happy to take questions on any of these items</p>
<p><em>03:47</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> and</p>
<p><em>03:49</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> I&#39;ll move actually through to item two. I&#39;ve already mentioned some of the work</p>
<p><em>03:55</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> that&#39;s</p>
<p><em>03:55</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> in item two that has come through from</p>
<p><em>03:58</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the</p>
<p><em>03:58</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> PBC Pacific.</p>
<p><em>04:00</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> and the strategic plan that&#39;s being developed there. And the goals of the academic leadership framework which were endorsed</p>
<p><em>04:07</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> by</p>
<p><em>04:08</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the VCDD and which will be really important in terms of supporting</p>
<p><em>04:13</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> student</p>
<p><em>04:14</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> -centric decisions as we go forward. So</p>
<p><em>04:16</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> very</p>
<p><em>04:17</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> pleased to see that now starting to take shape and be implemented.</p>
<p><em>04:22</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> Under</p>
<p><em>04:23</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> 2.9, just I think most of you will be aware but</p>
<p><em>04:28</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> one</p>
<p><em>04:29</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> of the</p>
<p><em>04:30</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> key issues around particularly the Covid agenda and with a new vice chancellor coming in</p>
<p><em>04:35</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> has been the importance of</p>
<p><em>04:37</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> me</p>
<p><em>04:38</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> getting in front of the staff and having the staff across and aware of the developments</p>
<p><em>04:43</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> and</p>
<p><em>04:44</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> decisions that are being made in response to</p>
<p><em>04:46</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> Covid</p>
<p><em>04:47</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> -19 and also in preparation for our new strategy.</p>
<p><em>04:51</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> And so there have already been a couple of all staff forums.</p>
<p><em>04:55</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> These</p>
<p><em>04:55</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> would normally be face to face, but of course we&#39;re managing them</p>
<p><em>04:58</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> online</p>
<p><em>04:59</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> at the moment and there&#39;s going to be a further forum tomorrow</p>
<p><em>05:02</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> with</p>
<p><em>05:04</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> an opening to talk about what the IMT group are doing and</p>
<p><em>05:08</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> to</p>
<p><em>05:08</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> talk more broadly about the student engagement and research activities.</p>
<p><em>05:12</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> They&#39;ve</p>
<p><em>05:13</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> been really well attended and we&#39;ll continue to do them throughout this period of time where we&#39;re unable to meet face to face. Importantly, there are numerous questions coming through those forums.</p>
<p><em>05:25</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> And</p>
<p><em>05:25</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> what we&#39;ve done is collated the questions that we&#39;ve been unable to answer directly in the forum and put together a web page where we&#39;ve got frequently asked questions where we&#39;re attempting to address the concerns and the questions of the staff, which of course are very broad and I&#39;ll come back to that in a moment. On item three, I wasn&#39;t going to spend too much time talking about the Fs. This is one of the things that of course we&#39;ll be talking about.</p>
<p><em>05:55</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> on the agenda later. But we&#39;ve already heard today and the work that&#39;s ongoing that you&#39;re aware of from Auckland Online and the opportunities for the development of micro-credentials and the summer school activities which are referenced within this particular item.</p>
<p><em>06:14</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> Again,</p>
<p><em>06:14</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> happy to take questions on that and I&#39;m sure</p>
<p><em>06:17</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> that</p>
<p><em>06:18</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> other members of the team would be willing to do so as well.</p>
<p><em>06:22</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> One</p>
<p><em>06:22</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> thing just to say is that we did run a specific forum for all postgraduate students.</p>
<p><em>06:28</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> Jim</p>
<p><em>06:29</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> led that with Carolyn last week and that was another really well attended forum and an important forum for the researchers and the postgrad students to think about how they can continue with business continuity in this period through the level three and potential level three alert lockdowns.</p>
<p><em>06:51</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> If I go then to item 4 here, high quality research, again</p>
<p><em>06:57</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> we</p>
<p><em>06:58</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> can see that there is some input this time from our PVC Pacific. We are going to be addressing a number of things related to ethics and research on our agenda later, so I&#39;m going to leave it at that and go directly to Sustainable Autonomous University.</p>
<p><em>07:16</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> and</p>
<p><em>07:16</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> acknowledging under 5.3 the major gifts and pledges</p>
<p><em>07:20</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> that</p>
<p><em>07:21</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> were received in January and February</p>
<p><em>07:23</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> of</p>
<p><em>07:24</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> this year, which are significant and outstanding. And you&#39;ll note the commentary there around</p>
<p><em>07:30</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the</p>
<p><em>07:31</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> foundation. And of course,</p>
<p><em>07:34</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> in</p>
<p><em>07:35</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the first six weeks of my tenure, I have been able to write to our</p>
<p><em>07:38</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> donors</p>
<p><em>07:39</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> and alumni and attempt to</p>
<p><em>07:41</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> keep</p>
<p><em>07:42</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> a level of engagement around the activities</p>
<p><em>07:46</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> both</p>
<p><em>07:46</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> that they&#39;ve committed to but also engage them in the activities that we&#39;re</p>
<p><em>07:51</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> planning</p>
<p><em>07:51</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> around the student student hardship going forward.</p>
<p><em>07:56</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> I&#39;ll</p>
<p><em>07:56</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> continue to move through and I wanted to pick up</p>
<p><em>07:59</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> on</p>
<p><em>08:00</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> item seven and particularly around the treaty</p>
<p><em>08:03</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> but</p>
<p><em>08:04</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> to recognise</p>
<p><em>08:05</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> actually</p>
<p><em>08:06</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the launch of the Toreo language plan</p>
<p><em>08:09</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> which</p>
<p><em>08:10</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> was launched on the 7th of April and this is a really significant achievement and I want to congratulate the team</p>
<p><em>08:15</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> that have been involved</p>
<p><em>08:16</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> in</p>
<p><em>08:17</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> getting us to this point. And I believe tomorrow we&#39;re going to be able to launch the app</p>
<p><em>08:23</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> that</p>
<p><em>08:23</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> goes with that. So</p>
<p><em>08:25</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> a</p>
<p><em>08:25</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> really outstanding development there.</p>
<p><em>08:29</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> If</p>
<p><em>08:30</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> I can then perhaps move on</p>
<p><em>08:32</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> to, I</p>
<p><em>08:34</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> think I&#39;ll go directly to item nine.</p>
<p><em>08:37</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> As</p>
<p><em>08:38</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> you will no doubt be aware, a significant amount of time has gone into the responses to COVID-19.</p>
<p><em>08:44</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> and that&#39;s quite a condensed report but it doesn&#39;t really take account of the extensive work that the team have been involved in and the staff have responded to and it&#39;s been phenomenal to see the way in which the staff have responded</p>
<p><em>08:58</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> to</p>
<p><em>08:59</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the significant ask</p>
<p><em>09:00</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> that</p>
<p><em>09:01</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> has been required of them over the last few weeks.</p>
<p><em>09:39</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> I</p>
<p><em>09:40</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> think</p>
<p><em>09:41</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> it&#39;s worthwhile</p>
<p><em>09:43</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> pointing out that under 9.4</p>
<p><em>09:45</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> accommodation,</p>
<p><em>09:47</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> you may have</p>
<p><em>09:48</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> read</p>
<p><em>09:49</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> over the weekend that there was some media interest around</p>
<p><em>09:53</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the</p>
<p><em>09:54</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> ways in which we&#39;ve continued to</p>
<p><em>09:56</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> charge</p>
<p><em>09:57</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> student fees</p>
<p><em>09:58</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> around</p>
<p><em>09:59</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> accommodation and the comments around that from the various</p>
<p><em>10:03</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> members</p>
<p><em>10:04</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> of the community and from the community.</p>
<p><em>10:05</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> from members of parliament, but also</p>
<p><em>10:07</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> particularly</p>
<p><em>10:08</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> because different universities have taken a different tack on this.</p>
<p><em>10:13</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> We&#39;ve</p>
<p><em>10:13</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> been very clear about the way in which we&#39;ve addressed this and</p>
<p><em>10:16</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> have</p>
<p><em>10:17</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> made a very</p>
<p><em>10:18</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> detailed</p>
<p><em>10:20</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> response to the media. They have not necessarily picked it all up with accuracy. And a lot of what was in the media at the weekend wasn&#39;t accurate, but we have been able to respond fully</p>
<p><em>10:32</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> to</p>
<p><em>10:33</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the questions that have been</p>
<p><em>10:34</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> asked</p>
<p><em>10:35</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> of us, both</p>
<p><em>10:35</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> from government and from</p>
<p><em>10:37</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> parents</p>
<p><em>10:38</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> who have been quite concerned about some of the things that they&#39;ve been reading.</p>
<p><em>10:43</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> I think then finally I might just move to</p>
<p><em>10:49</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> something</p>
<p><em>10:49</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> that&#39;s not in the report today</p>
<p><em>10:51</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> but</p>
<p><em>10:52</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> it is relevant to the work that we&#39;re doing around the</p>
<p><em>10:55</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> planning</p>
<p><em>10:56</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> for the workforce of the future and</p>
<p><em>10:58</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> particularly</p>
<p><em>10:59</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> recognising that staff at the moment are of course concerned about employment security</p>
<p><em>11:04</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> in</p>
<p><em>11:05</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the immediate term. And I&#39;ve made very clear statements that no long-term plans will be made at the moment around the workforce planning because we&#39;re developing new strategy and it&#39;s going to be important that the strategy</p>
<p><em>11:19</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> leads</p>
<p><em>11:20</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> those decisions.</p>
<p><em>11:21</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> However,</p>
<p><em>11:22</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> we have received from the State Service Commission</p>
<p><em>11:25</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> some</p>
<p><em>11:26</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> information yesterday and today related to restriction</p>
<p><em>11:31</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> around</p>
<p><em>11:33</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the pay and</p>
<p><em>11:34</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> pay freezers</p>
<p><em>11:35</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> for</p>
<p><em>11:35</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> staff going forward and there&#39;ll be a communication going out around that</p>
<p><em>11:39</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> tomorrow</p>
<p><em>11:40</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> and we have an all staff form tomorrow so we&#39;ll make sure that we&#39;re really</p>
<p><em>11:44</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> clear</p>
<p><em>11:45</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> about the impact of that for staff</p>
<p><em>11:47</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> having</p>
<p><em>11:48</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> said that</p>
<p><em>11:48</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> it&#39;s</p>
<p><em>11:49</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> quite clear if you look at the information that&#39;s come through the state service commission that what&#39;s already been agreed</p>
<p><em>11:54</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> through</p>
<p><em>11:55</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> our</p>
<p><em>11:56</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> enterprise</p>
<p><em>11:57</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> bargaining will remain</p>
<p><em>11:58</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> for</p>
<p><em>11:59</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the period</p>
<p><em>11:59</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> so</p>
<p><em>12:01</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> i think i&#39;ll leave it at that i&#39;m very happy to take questions</p>
<p><em>12:04</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> on</p>
<p><em>12:05</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> any matters of the report. And of course, happy Adrian, if you think there are other things that it might be worthwhile bringing to the council&#39;s attention.</p>
<p><em>12:16</em>
I</p>
<p><em>12:17</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> just wonder, Dawn, look, there is so much work to do on the strategy and there is so much that we don&#39;t know, but</p>
<p><em>12:25</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> you</p>
<p><em>12:26</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> are evolving your thinking in terms of the way that you&#39;re going to communicate the evolution of the strategy.</p>
<p><em>12:35</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> and the communication and interaction with stakeholders going forward. Can you just comment on that most particularly for the benefit of folk who are listening in?</p>
<p><em>12:49</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> Thanks, Chancellor, for the opportunity to do that. So really importantly, recognising that the pressing, the most pressing activity for us at the moment is to develop that strategy and vision.</p>
<p><em>13:04</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> And</p>
<p><em>13:05</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> within that will be the five-year strategic plan,</p>
<p><em>13:08</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> a</p>
<p><em>13:09</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> vision that takes us out way into the 2020s to 2030 and</p>
<p><em>13:14</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> falling</p>
<p><em>13:15</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> out of that, then the annual plans that are looked at on a three-year rolling cycle.</p>
<p><em>13:20</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> To</p>
<p><em>13:21</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> do that and the process we&#39;re going to go through, it&#39;s going to be really important that we</p>
<p><em>13:25</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> engage</p>
<p><em>13:26</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the staff and, in fact, the student body in that work, as well as our external stakeholders</p>
<p><em>13:32</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> in</p>
<p><em>13:33</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> a variety of ways.</p>
<p><em>13:34</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> in an interactive way. And so as we start to develop the green papers, these papers will be developed and indeed worked through a series of workshops and town halls</p>
<p><em>13:48</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> and</p>
<p><em>13:49</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> forums and our existing committee structures and our existing informal meeting structures by way of testing out</p>
<p><em>13:56</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> our</p>
<p><em>13:57</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> thinking, the horizon scanning,</p>
<p><em>13:59</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> how</p>
<p><em>14:00</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> we want to be seen in the future, the value add that we can do.</p>
<p><em>14:04</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> can make into the future in terms of both our contribution to</p>
<p><em>14:07</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the</p>
<p><em>14:08</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> nation but beyond that</p>
<p><em>14:10</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> into</p>
<p><em>14:11</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> Oceana and to ensure that we are engaging with staff in a way that they feel this is a strategy</p>
<p><em>14:18</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> that</p>
<p><em>14:19</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> we all own and share.</p>
<p><em>14:21</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> The</p>
<p><em>14:21</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> most important part for me of that strategy is really about getting the people and culture settings right. So whilst it&#39;s important to be clear about purpose</p>
<p><em>14:31</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> and</p>
<p><em>14:32</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> important to be clear about the direction of</p>
<p><em>14:34</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> of travel, it&#39;s the people and culture strategy that really sets the tone. And so going through the development of the strategy, we&#39;ll be making sure that we are involving people and</p>
<p><em>14:45</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> giving</p>
<p><em>14:46</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> some serious thought to the culture</p>
<p><em>14:48</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> that</p>
<p><em>14:49</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> we are inhabiting within the university and how people interact with us and how we interact with others. And that&#39;s something that all staff can be involved in. So even if staff are not directly involved</p>
<p><em>15:01</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> in</p>
<p><em>15:02</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the development of the research strategy,</p>
<p><em>15:04</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> or</p>
<p><em>15:04</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the campus master plan, the estate strategy or the financial targeted plan,</p>
<p><em>15:09</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> they</p>
<p><em>15:10</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> will all have an opportunity to be a part of the values clarification</p>
<p><em>15:13</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> and</p>
<p><em>15:14</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the defining characteristics of the university going forward.</p>
<p><em>15:20</em>
Thank</p>
<p><em>15:20</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> you. And just one point that might be of interest to also the folk on the call. Obviously, we&#39;re running our accommodation.</p>
<p><em>15:31</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> We still have a big pastoral care wrap around that, but we&#39;ve also got a very large population of students still in the halls. Can you just refresh my memory as to how many students there are that we&#39;ve still got on campus in the halls?</p>
<p><em>15:50</em>
Yep,</p>
<p><em>15:51</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> I might just ask Adrian to give an update on that.</p>
<p><em>15:55</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> Something over a thousand I seem to.</p>
<p><em>15:58</em>
It&#39;s</p>
<p><em>15:59</em>
<em>Speaker 4:</em> about</p>
<p><em>15:59</em>
1500.</p>
<p><em>16:01</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> 1,500. Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Adrian, which I think is somewhat different to what you&#39;re seeing in some of the other jurisdictions or other institutions. So with that said, questions or comments from Council for the Vice-Chancellor.</p>
<p><em>16:32</em>
you</p>
<p><em>16:32</em>
<em>Speaker 2:</em> say, Dawn, you prepared something that you sent to the media. I wonder if you could circulate that to Council so that we&#39;ve got a clear understanding that when we&#39;re, you know, asked by people, that we have a clear understanding of what&#39;s going on with the accommodation.</p>
<p><em>16:48</em>
I</p>
<p><em>16:48</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> think that&#39;s a really good idea Cecilia so we&#39;ve we had a drafted response that went also out to</p>
<p><em>16:54</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> Chloe</p>
<p><em>16:55</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> Swarbrick and a few others who&#39;ve been interested in knowing what we&#39;re doing so we&#39;ve got some very</p>
<p><em>17:02</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> very</p>
<p><em>17:03</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> clear messages which may be helpful for you to be able to share if people are asking you.</p>
<p><em>17:08</em>
<em>Speaker 2:</em> That&#39;d be great thank you.</p>
<p><em>17:12</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> Tonsa, just through you. Congratulations on the sustainability award, that&#39;s fantastic.</p>
<p><em>17:18</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> I&#39;m</p>
<p><em>17:19</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> not sure how big the application is, but it would be</p>
<p><em>17:23</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> quite</p>
<p><em>17:23</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> useful if it&#39;s not too big to pop that into the Resource Centre for Diligence so we can see what factors we&#39;re reporting on and what activities we&#39;re doing, because we don&#39;t really have a great deal of visibility of what was in that</p>
<p><em>17:39</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> report</p>
<p><em>17:40</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> or that application.</p>
<p><em>17:43</em>
Wendy</p>
<p><em>17:44</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> could we perhaps get you to chase that up.</p>
<p><em>17:48</em>
It is</p>
<p><em>17:50</em>
<em>Speaker 6:</em> extremely large. It</p>
<p><em>17:52</em>
is</p>
<p><em>17:54</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> quite extensive and Pamela I&#39;m just wondering if you could do if there&#39;s a way of summarizing it in some way.</p>
<p><em>18:00</em>
<em>Speaker 6:</em> I think we would be better to summarize it because it&#39;s a response to quite specific questions and</p>
<p><em>18:07</em>
<em>Speaker 6:</em> quite</p>
<p><em>18:07</em>
<em>Speaker 6:</em> a large part of the set of information</p>
<p><em>18:12</em>
<em>Speaker 6:</em> We don&#39;t actually have because they&#39;re research metrics that Thompson&#39;s Reuter, that Elsevier develop</p>
<p><em>18:19</em>
<em>Speaker 6:</em> and</p>
<p><em>18:20</em>
<em>Speaker 6:</em> that the Times Higher people use. So we have a set of scores that we can send through but the portfolio itself is quite</p>
<p><em>18:29</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> considerable. Okay well maybe an executive summary then.</p>
<p><em>18:34</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> Yeah.</p>
<p><em>18:36</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> Thank you. And just in terms of the strategy I mean that&#39;s quite a</p>
<p><em>18:42</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> useful piece of work, although a bit distracted at the moment with COVID-19 activities. Presumably that will also cover sort of our view of workforce for the future and any paradigm shifts and international versus domestic.</p>
<p><em>18:58</em>
So</p>
<p><em>18:59</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> exactly that. So of course, part of the strategy, we&#39;re looking at the size, shape and composition of the university going forward</p>
<p><em>19:06</em>
in</p>
<p><em>19:07</em>
<em>Speaker 7:</em> the</p>
<p><em>19:07</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> context of the global shift, which is a paradigm shift in</p>
<p><em>19:11</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> high</p>
<p><em>19:12</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> as well as</p>
<p><em>19:13</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> what&#39;s</p>
<p><em>19:14</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> relevant for us in terms of UOA in the nation and in our region.</p>
<p><em>19:20</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> That</p>
<p><em>19:20</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> includes looking at for example the ratio of undergrad</p>
<p><em>19:24</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> to</p>
<p><em>19:25</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> postgrad, the ratio of international to domestic, the ratio, the mix</p>
<p><em>19:30</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> in</p>
<p><em>19:30</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> terms of discipline mix, there&#39;s a whole set of parameters that we look at there and of course there&#39;s also the volume and quality question as well because we&#39;re a research intensive university and it&#39;s important</p>
<p><em>19:42</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> It&#39;s important that we make sure that what we develop is distinctive for the longer term.</p>
<p><em>19:47</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> Good.</p>
<p><em>19:48</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> Thank you.</p>
<p><em>19:51</em>
So</p>
<p><em>19:51</em>
<em>Speaker 4:</em> other questions? Okay, so we will</p>
<p><em>19:59</em>
<em>Speaker 8:</em> note that report. Thank you</p>
<p><em>20:01</em>
for</p>
<p><em>20:02</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> that. Can you hear me? Yes, go ahead, John.</p>
<p><em>20:06</em>
<em>Speaker 8:</em> Yeah, I just wanted to ask Dawn. She mentioned that the Te Reo language</p>
<p><em>20:13</em>
<em>Speaker 8:</em> Plan was being launched tomorrow. And she acknowledged Cindy and the team and I just want to tote that acknowledgement of them. But is that going to be accessible in any way for</p>
<p><em>20:25</em>
<em>Speaker 8:</em> people</p>
<p><em>20:26</em>
<em>Speaker 8:</em> like myself and others that are not on campus</p>
<p><em>20:29</em>
<em>Speaker 8:</em> to</p>
<p><em>20:31</em>
<em>Speaker 8:</em> have a look at?</p>
<p><em>20:33</em>
Yeah,</p>
<p><em>20:34</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> so I&#39;ll make sure that</p>
<p><em>20:35</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> we</p>
<p><em>20:36</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> circulate the information around that about that to you, John, because</p>
<p><em>20:40</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> the</p>
<p><em>20:41</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> language plan</p>
<p><em>20:46</em>
<em>Speaker 3:</em> The app is going to be launched tomorrow. If it&#39;s not tomorrow, it will be Monday. But yes, that&#39;s something that I&#39;m hopeful will mean that people will start to use that app as opposed to some of the other ones that are available that have been produced through the universities in New Zealand.</p>
<p><em>21:05</em>
Okay,</p>
<p><em>21:06</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> thanks. Right, so we&#39;ll note that report and we will move to Senate matters. And I think I saw John Morrow earlier. I think he&#39;s</p>
<p><em>21:19</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> somewhere</p>
<p><em>21:21</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> nearby. John, are you there?</p>
<p><em>21:24</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> Yes, I am, Scott, yes.</p>
<p><em>21:27</em>
I</p>
<p><em>21:28</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> am comforted by that. Right, where are your hands?</p>
<p><em>21:32</em>
Okay,</p>
<p><em>21:32</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> thanks.</p>
<p><em>21:33</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> Thank you very much, Chancellor. Part A recommendations from Senate requiring to be considered</p>
<p><em>21:39</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> and</p>
<p><em>21:40</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> received by Council. Of the academic matters, there are four new academic programs which have been developed by the Faculty of Business and Economics, and we seek approval</p>
<p><em>21:53</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> for</p>
<p><em>21:54</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> these programs to be advanced to QAP for its consideration. These programs are interesting.</p>
<p><em>22:03</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> ones. The first involves changes to the Bachelor of Commerce, the major undergraduate term qualification in that faculty. And the main points about the change are to introduce a multidisciplinary core of four courses in the first year, and also to produce a capstone or to acquire a capstone course in the last year of study, which gives</p>
<p><em>22:33</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> students and give students an opportunity to integrate what they&#39;ve learned over the course of their studies. And this revised program reflects the outcome of program reviews and significant work by the faculty.</p>
<p><em>22:52</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> In</p>
<p><em>22:53</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> addition, there are three postgraduate qualifications, a Master of Business Analytics, a Master of</p>
<p><em>23:03</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> A Master of Business with some discrete specialisations and also a Master of Information Governance. The last of these programmes has been developed by the Department of Commercial Law. These programmes are all available in 180 or 120 versions for candidates with appropriate entry qualifications.</p>
<p><em>23:31</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> And these programs reflect the faculty&#39;s attempt to identify new areas which will meet the needs of the business and wider community in New Zealand. That&#39;s all I have to say on the Senate matters, Chancellor.</p>
<p><em>23:53</em>
So</p>
<p><em>23:54</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> questions for John regarding the Senate matters.</p>
<p><em>24:05</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> Okay. Sorry, Scott. Sorry, John.</p>
<p><em>24:11</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> Can</p>
<p><em>24:12</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> you just confirm to me, does the capstone course, it doesn&#39;t add time to the sort of minimum time of the degree, does it?</p>
<p><em>24:21</em>
No,</p>
<p><em>24:22</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> it&#39;s part of the regular structure of the program, and it&#39;s taken typically in the last semester of the</p>
<p><em>24:31</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> last semester of study. So that&#39;s a</p>
<p><em>24:33</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> compulsory course.</p>
<p><em>24:34</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> It&#39;s a compulsory course. Students have have a great deal of flexibility about what particular focus they take in in responding to that opportunity.</p>
<p><em>24:45</em>
Right. Okay. Which</p>
<p><em>24:49</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> is quite a quite a change for the commerce degree.</p>
<p><em>24:53</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> It is yes and it follows capstones which have been introduced in other in other in other programs.</p>
<p><em>25:01</em>
So</p>
<p><em>25:01</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> this will be part of our strategic thinking then, going forward.</p>
<p><em>25:09</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> If</p>
<p><em>25:10</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> it&#39;s considered an appropriate way to</p>
<p><em>25:12</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> close</p>
<p><em>25:13</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> out a course, then</p>
<p><em>25:14</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> perhaps</p>
<p><em>25:15</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> it&#39;s applicable across the wide range of courses.</p>
<p><em>25:18</em>
Yes,</p>
<p><em>25:18</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> I think that&#39;s the case. And it provides students with an opportunity to reflect on the range of components that they&#39;ve studied in the course of a programme.</p>
<p><em>25:30</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> and to pull them together in some sort of coherent and interesting way.</p>
<p><em>25:36</em>
<em>Speaker 9:</em> Okay,</p>
<p><em>25:36</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> thank you.</p>
<p><em>25:37</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> And I know there was a really good list of people who had input into that work.</p>
<p><em>25:45</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> So anything else on Senate?</p>
<p><em>25:50</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> That</p>
<p><em>25:50</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> being the case, I will move that the recommendations in part of the report of Senate from April this year be adopted.</p>
<p><em>26:00</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> and that Part B and C be noted. Can I have a seconder, please?</p>
<p><em>26:05</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> I will.</p>
<p><em>26:06</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> Thank you very much. Who was that? Who was it?</p>
<p><em>26:10</em>
<em>Speaker 5:</em> Kath.</p>
<p><em>26:10</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> Kath, beautiful. There you are. There&#39;s your smiling face. It&#39;s tricky. All those in favour say aye. Aye. Against. Carried. Thank you. So we&#39;ll move to correspondence.</p>
<p><em>26:30</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> echoing what Dawn said a little earlier, I got as Chancellor last night a note from Peter Hughes, who&#39;s Head of State Services, just encouraging pay restraints. So there&#39;s nothing new in that.</p>
<p><em>26:51</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> So</p>
<p><em>26:52</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> is there any other correspondence that I&#39;m not aware of</p>
<p><em>26:56</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> that</p>
<p><em>26:58</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> I need to be aware of? No.</p>
<p><em>26:59</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> So we will move to item 9. Other decisions for noting. Is there anything else?</p>
<p><em>27:07</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> I</p>
<p><em>27:08</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> don&#39;t think so. Is there any general business?</p>
<p><em>27:15</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> Anyone</p>
<p><em>27:15</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> require a leave of absence?</p>
<p><em>27:19</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> That</p>
<p><em>27:20</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> being the case, we will move to part B and I will move that the public be excluded from part B of this meeting.</p>
<p><em>27:28</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> However, that Adrian Clelland, Professors Metson, Morrow and Morrow, Peter Gutzel, Pamela Moss, Todd Somerville, Bridget Fitzpatrick, Wendy and Richard Elliott be permitted to remain.</p>
<p><em>27:49</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> And</p>
<p><em>27:50</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> with that said, we will move to part B.</p>
<p><em>27:58</em>
<em>Speaker 1:</em> Do you need to give</p>
<p><em>27:59</em>
<em>Speaker 4:</em> me</p>
<p><em>28:00</em>
<em>Speaker 4:</em> a</p>
<p><em>28:02</em>
<em>Speaker 4:</em> signal? Maybe. We&#39;re all good, Scott. Thank you. We&#39;re all</p>
<p><em>28:15</em>
<em>Speaker 4:</em> good.</p>
