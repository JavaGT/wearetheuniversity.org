<p><strong>Wednesday, 29 April 2020, 12:52 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZEI">NZEI</a></strong></p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa says educators across schools and early childhood services will be pleased that the Ministry of Education has announced one-off funding to cover their flu vaccinations undertaken between now and 30 June 2020.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa President Liam Rutherford welcomed the news, after raising the issue publicly.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has said that schools and centres with existing vaccination programmes for staff will be reimbursed, and it is working on developing a programme for those who don&#39;t.</p>
<p>&quot;Once vaccination programmes are in place I strongly encourage all staff across the education sector who have contact with children to get immunised as soon as possible,&quot; he says. &quot;Staff should talk to their school leaders or centre managers about what their workplace&#39;s plans are for taking up the Ministry&#39;s funding.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Any outbreak of respiratory illness in a school or centre would cause a lot of alarm and disruption until Covid-19 could be ruled out. So as our educators move to the front line in the reopening of Aotearoa, it makes sense to protect them and their students in this way.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Rutherford also welcomed an expansion of the COVID-19 Leave Support Scheme which will enable education providers to access funding for those who need to take leave because of Ministry of Health guidelines.</p>
<p>The vaccination funding for workers in education includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any person employed or contracted as teaching, childcare staff, including specialist education professionals and others who provide support, for example children with additional learning needs.</li>
<li>Any person employed by or contracted to an educational facility.</li>
</ul>
