<p><strong>Wednesday, 29 April 2020, 1:48 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato">University of Waikato</a></strong></p>
<p>This month, more than 1000 University of Waikato students graduated, and while none could be part of a traditional ceremony, many have taken it upon themselves to celebrate graduation in a more unique way.</p>
<p>Last week, students took to social media, sharing images of them wearing graduation gowns and headboards made from items found in their home.</p>
<p>One student posted: “My bubble threw me a surprise graduation ceremony after work. DIY cap, gown and certificate! Super stoked.”</p>
<p>Last week, Vice-Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley addressed graduates via video, acknowledging that, despite the current situation, students should still be proud of their accomplishments.</p>
<p>“The University wanted to take some time to celebrate your hard work, and your achievements in completing your qualification,” said Professor Quigley.</p>
<p>“In my role as Vice-Chancellor, the opportunity to congratulate our graduates face-to-face at a graduation ceremony is one of the highlights of my role, and I certainly regret not being able to do it on this occasion. So today, I am sharing this video message with you – a first in the history of graduations at the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the whole University community, I celebrate with you today the great event that is your graduation, and I wish you all the best in the next phase of your life.”</p>
<p>In the same video, University of Waikato Chancellor, Rt Hon Sir Anand Satyanand, also addressed graduates, saying that while the situation does not allow for a traditional ceremony, it shouldn’t affect the importance and significance of the occasion.</p>

<p>“It represents the culmination of months and, in some cases, years of focussed effort. You have every right, individually, to feel satisfied and proud of your achievement.”</p>
<p>Hamilton Mayor Paula Southgate, and Tauranga Mayor Tenby Powell, along with Waikato Students’ Union President, Kyla Campbell-Kamariera, also shared video messages to graduates.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato April graduation ceremonies were due to take place at Claudelands Events Centre and the University’s Te Kohinga Mārama Marae.</p>
<p>Students who would have graduated at the University’s Tauranga ceremony, which normally takes place in the middle of the year, also graduated this month.</p>
