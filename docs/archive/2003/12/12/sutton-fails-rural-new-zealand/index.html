<p>Sutton Fails Rural New Zealand</p>
<p>Thursday 11 Dec 2003 Gerry Eckhoff Press Releases -- Rural</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Rural Affairs Spokesman Gerry Eckhoff today highlighted Rural Affairs Minister Jim Sutton&#39;s ongoing failure to stand up for the concerns of rural New Zealand - a constituency he&#39;s supposed to represent at the Cabinet table.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Sutton&#39;s appalling record in the past 12 months speaks for itself,&quot; Mr Eckhoff said.</p>
<p>&quot;This past year, farmers have been under constant attack from the Government: the fart tax debacle - which saw hundreds of farmers march on Parliament in disgust at Labour&#39;s anti-farmer proposal - his failure to advocate on behalf of rural schools facing closure, rising rural crime - up seven percent in Otago alone - Labour&#39;s invasion of farmers&#39; property rights over land access, and rural hospitals facing cuts because of race-based funding.</p>
<p>&quot;Farmers are sick to the back teeth of Mr Sutton&#39;s failure to front up, and say enough is enough, whenever his Cabinet colleagues propose dumb legislation or make decisions that aren&#39;t in the best interests of rural communities.</p>
<p>Mr Sutton&#39;s major problem is that he&#39;s been captured by pointy-headed officials, who wouldn&#39;t know a farmer if they tripped and fell over one.</p>
<p>&quot;Like his Cabinet colleague, David Parker, Mr Sutton must stand up for the community he purports to represent. However, I won&#39;t be holding my breath - Labour MPs have a nasty habit of representing their caucus&#39;s decisions to the electorate, rather than vice versa.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Sutton should be ashamed of what he, and his Government, are doing to rural New Zealand. My tip for the Minister during the Christmas break: Get out of Wellington, visit rural communities, and start listening to their concerns,&quot; Mr Eckhoff said.</p>
