<p>Victoria University rewards staff achievements</p>
<p>The hard work and achievements of Victoria University&#39;s staff in the last year are to be rewarded with the University distributing almost $1.3 million in a one-off payment.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon said the one-off payment represented 1.75 percent of an employee&#39;s base salary for the past 11 months. The payment, totalling $1.29 million, will be made before the end of the University year.</p>
<p>&quot;Record enrolments, the introduction of the Performance-Based Research Fund, the development of significant new partnerships and the transition to a multi-campus University have made for a challenging year. &quot;Victoria was able meet these challenges, and succeed, because of the dedication and hard work of its staff and I&#39;m particularly pleased the University&#39;s good fortunes can be shared with them.&quot;</p>
<p>More than 18,500 students enrolled with Victoria in 2003, about 2,000 more than in the year before, and this, combined with careful financial management means it will achieve a surplus of about $8 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The 2003 surplus will be used to continue this programme of campus expansion and enhancement while improving services to students and staff and expanding our research facilities,&quot; Professor McCutcheon said.</p>
<p>The year saw construction on a host of major capital works projects, including enhancement of the Kelburn and a Te Aro campuses, and new lecture theatres and student learning spaces at Rutherford House, part of the University&#39;s Pipitea Campus in downtown Wellington.<br>The University also secured a long-term lease over a third of the Wellington Railway Station which it is upgrading under contract to the building&#39;s new owner, the New Zealand Government. It also signed an agreement with the Malaghan Institute of Medical Research, New Zealand&#39;s leading independent biomedical research centre, that will see it move to the University&#39;s Kelburn campus in 2004 and be housed in a specially refurbished building.</p>
<p>Further development of the University strategic alliance with the Wellington College of Education was also a feature of 2003 as was successful implementation of a joint library management system with Auckland University of Technology and Otago and Waikato universities.</p>
