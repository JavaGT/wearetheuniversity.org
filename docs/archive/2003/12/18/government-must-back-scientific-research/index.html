<p><strong>Thursday, 18 December 2003, 4:07 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Dr Paul Hutchison National Science Spokesman</p>
<p>18 December 2003</p>
<p>Government must back scientific research</p>
<p>National&#39;s Science spokesman Dr Paul Hutchison is backing the call of thousands of the country&#39;s scientists urging greater support and certainty for long-term research.</p>
<p>The scientists have sounded the alarm with an open letter to the Science Minister expressing &quot;serious ongoing concern&quot; about the effects government policy changes are having on fundamental long-term research.</p>
<p>The letter deals with the concerns about New Zealand&#39;s science capability, the quality of basic research and loss of research capability.</p>
<p>&quot;These are all issues of vital importance if New Zealand is to make it as a knowledge society,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government&#39;s being warned. The science community is seriously worried that basic discovery research is being compromised by commercialisation.</p>
<p>&quot;A recent issue of New Zealand&#39;s major scientific journal was dominated by calls for change in Government policy. Dr Alan Freeth has labelled the &#39;policy culture&#39; within the Crown Research Institutes as &#39;schizophrenic&#39;, says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;The Knowledge Wave Trust has called for the &quot;missing billion&quot; needed for research in New Zealand and the 2003 OECD report highlighted New Zealand&#39;s drop in R&amp;D spending as a proportion of GDP over the last four years.</p>
<p>&quot;Compared with countries like Singapore and Taiwan, New Zealand is way behind, says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is loud on rhetoric when it trumpets the knowledge economy and growth, but when it comes to funding scientific research, it&#39;s nowhere to be seen,&quot; he says.</p>
