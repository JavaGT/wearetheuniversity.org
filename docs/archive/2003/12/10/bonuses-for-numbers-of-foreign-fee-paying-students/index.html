<p>Media Release<br>December 10, 2003</p>
<p>Secondary Principals Paid Bonuses For Numbers Of Foreign Fee-Paying Students</p>
<p>New Zealand First has questioned the ethics of secondary principals being paid ‘bonuses’ based on the number of foreign fee-paying students attending their schools</p>
<p>School boards have to make a case to the Ministry of Education if they wish to pay their principals extra money for additional responsibilities.</p>
<p>In 2001, 10 requests were received, in 2002, 38 requests and in 2003, 51 requests were made. The number approved by the Ministry were 8 in 2001, 33 in 2002 and 38 in 2003.</p>
<p>“There is obviously an increasing trend for these bonuses,” said New Zealand First education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly.</p>
<p>“It is wrong that principals should receive bonuses for the number of foreign fee-paying students they recruit. They are employed to look after the interests of New Zealand students – not to go on trips around the world on recruitment drives.</p>
<p>“Do principals get bonuses for achieving high rates of academic excellence? – No. Do they get bonuses for high levels of fundraising?– No.</p>
<p>“All the incentives are for principals to ignore the critical elements of educational leadership and to chase the export education dollar.</p>
<p>“This process brings the profession into disrepute and it is appalling that the Government condones this practice,” said Mr Donnelly.</p>
