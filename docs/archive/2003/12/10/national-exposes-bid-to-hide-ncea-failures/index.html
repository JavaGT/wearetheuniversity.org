<p>Hon Bill English MP National Party Education Spokesman</p>

<p>National exposes bid to hide NCEA failures</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English says the Government has admitted to &quot;a deliberate attempt to mislead parents and employers over NCEA failure rates.&quot;</p>
<p>In response to Parliamentary questions today, Education Minister Trevor Mallard has admitted that some schools have been instructed not to report failed NCEA internal-assessment results to the New Zealand Qualifications Authority.</p>
<p>&quot;Schools have been told to instead &#39;find your good news stories&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;The policy is a mess. Trevor Mallard couldn&#39;t say whether the Government had instructed schools to hide the internal assessment failures, or report them.</p>
<p>&quot;In essence this means the NZQA has no reliable record of student failure rates,&quot; Mr English says.</p>
<p>&quot;How can parents be expected to gauge the achievement rates of their schools when some schools are reporting failures and some are hiding them away?</p>
<p>&quot;How can employers rely on NCEA results when there is no record of failure?</p>
<p>&quot;This confused state of affairs can be directly blamed on the ridiculous instructions being issued by the NZQA,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Senior NZQA official Kate Colbert has been quoted telling Auckland Deputy and Assistant Principals on October 13 that, &#39;data we have at the moment is flawed because some schools do send in non-achieved and some don&#39;t. NZQA says don&#39;t send them in&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;She advised schools to &#39;... look at your results, find your good news stories, get to the media before the results come out and tell them those stories.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s deception. The Minister must take responsibility for an NZQA policy that gives schools permission to gloss over the realities of failure and substitute it for &#39;good news stories&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;This is yet another example of the politically correct attitude of Mallard&#39;s Ministry - a Ministry that refuses to face-up to the realities of poor student achievement and instead seeks to avoid mention of failure at any cost,&quot; Mr English says.</p>
