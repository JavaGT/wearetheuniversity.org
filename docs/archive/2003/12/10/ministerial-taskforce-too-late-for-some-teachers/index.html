<p>Ministerial Taskforce Too Late For Some Teachers</p>
<p>Wednesday 10 Dec 2003 Deborah Coddington Press Releases -- Education -- Save Our Schools</p>
<p>Today&#39;s Ministerial Taskforce report on secondary teacher remuneration will do nothing for many of the teachers caught up in Education Minister Trevor Mallard&#39;s systematic programme of school closures,&quot; ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard has demonstrated, time-and-time again, his inability to manage his portfolio by his heavy-handed and arrogant attitude towards principals, teachers and parents over the closure of up to 300 schools,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;An example of this is Tongariro High School - which finally closed its doors last Friday. This is the first secondary school to do so under the Minister&#39;s ill-advised and ill-considered programme of network reviews.</p>
<p>&quot;Fifteen out of 20 experienced and skilled teachers from this college are not going back to teaching - they&#39;ve had enough. What good will the Ministerial Taskforce&#39;s findings do for them?</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time to devolve funding and wrestle control away from the Minister and his bureaucrats. Let&#39;s give schools and communities the freedom and responsibility to determine their own futures - they deserve that much,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
