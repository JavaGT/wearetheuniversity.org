<p>Waikato University 40th Anniversary - Celebrating Success</p>
<p>Waikato University has today unveiled its plans for celebrating its 40th anniversary year from February 2004 to February 2005. The University was founded in 1964 and officially opened in February 1965.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be celebrating our 40th anniversary year with considerable pride in our achievements,&quot; says Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould. &quot;We look forward to the future with confidence and with the aim of building significantly on the very solid foundation our first four decades has provided. The university has become an integral part of Hamilton and the Waikato, as well as the wider New Zealand teriary education sector.</p>
<p>&quot;We value highly our partnerships with local people, business and iwi. As we celebrate our 40th, it is important for me to acknowledge each individual local and international student, staff member, Maori organisation, businessperson, partner institution, media and so on who has helped us achieve success.</p>
<p>&quot;We have built a uniquely Waikato institution ko te tanagata (for the people) which I am confident will continue to serve the region and the country well. I encourage people to join with us over the course of the celebrations and share in our success,&quot; says Professor Gould.</p>
<p>Below is a selection of the plans for next year:</p>
<p>Official 40th launch WEL Energy trust Academy of Performing Arts - Sunday Feb 29th This outside concert will feature performances that highlight the talent of Waikato staff, students and graduates including: opera singer and Waikato alumni Olivia Fraser, a Screen &amp; Media building projection show, Kapa Haka, other musical and dance performances and a fire works &amp; lighting extravaganza.</p>
<p>40th Anniversary scholarships In partnership with Mercury Energy, the University will award scholarships to all A&amp;B bursary new students in 2004. A ceremony marking the award will be held to highlight the scholarships.</p>
<p>Flags The Hamilton City Council has made available all 42 of the flag banners in Garden Place and Worley Place for our 40th year (Feb to Dec). A local community artist is currently drafting designs.</p>
<p>Static photo display The display will provide a visual history of the development and achievements of Waikato. These photos will be displayed throughout the year in different venues around campus and the city to ensure the maximum number of people can view them.</p>
<p>Graduation - Hamilton City Council partnership The University has been working with HCC to give graduation a higher profile in our 40th anniversary year. A number of new developments are planned including the production of two large graduation banners that will hang in the City and at the University during graduation week.</p>
