<p>MEDIA RELEASE 9 December 2003</p>
<p>Victoria celebrates nursing achievements</p>
<p>Nursing leaders gather in Wellington this week to celebrate 10 years since the appointment of the inaugural professor at Victoria University&#39;s Graduate School of Nursing &amp; Midwifery.</p>
<p>While nursing has been taught at Victoria since 1928, a review of the then department saw the establishment of Graduate School in 1994 and the appointment of Jill White as its first professor. To mark this anniversary, the School has organised an alumni conference to be held on Thursday 11 December, culminating with a black tie dinner.</p>
<p>Current Head of School, Professor Jan Duke said the School was in good health with a large number of PhD students graduating this year.</p>
<p>&quot;This gathering is a chance for alumni of the School and the former department to celebrate the successes of the last decade. The School has been at the forefront of changes that have helped transform nursing and midwifery into recognised professions that make valuable and substantial contributions to the health of New Zealanders. Much work remains to be done but it seems certain that the School and its graduates, who are now leaders in the profession, will continue to play a significant role.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Duke said previous Heads of School, Jill White and Ali Dixon, and Distinguished Professor Jean Watson, who carried out the review that led to the Graduate School&#39;s establishment, would address the conference. The conference would also hear from several graduates of the School.</p>
<p>Media are invited to attend the conference in the functions centre at the James Cook Grand Chancellor Hotel, The Terrace, Wellington, from 9am, Thursday December 11.</p>
