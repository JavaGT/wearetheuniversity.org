<p>Stop Beating Around The Child Support Bush</p>
<p>Monday 8 Dec 2003 Dr Muriel Newman Press Releases -- Social Welfare</p>
<p>Last week&#39;s debacle over New Zealand&#39;s ballooning child support debt - now standing at more than $730 million - failed to even address the fundamental cause of the problem, ACT New Zealand Social Welfare Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The most common reason for a parent&#39;s failure to pay their child support dues is that our family law system has, effectively, pushed them out of their child&#39;s life,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Each year, thousands of non-custodial parents, usually fathers, lose all effective contact with their children - in fact, more children lose a father every three months through the family court than lost a father during the entire period of World War II.</p>
<p>&quot;In contrast with New Zealand, child support compliance is high in countries where shared parenting is the law - once a non-custodial parent enjoys frequent and regular contact with their child, and is responsible for important decisions in that child&#39;s life - then there is little reluctance to fully contribute financially.</p>
<p>&quot;I am calling on the Labour Government to introduce shared parenting in the Care of Children Bill, in order to not only give children and parents a fair deal, but to also ensure that liable parents pay their dues,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
