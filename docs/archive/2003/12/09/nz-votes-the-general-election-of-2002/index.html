<p>NZ Votes: The General Election of 2002</p>
<p>Press release<br>9 December 2003<br>immediate</p>
<p><em>New Zealand Votes: The General Election of 2002</em> was launched with wit and aplomb last night by journalist and broadcaster Linda Clark. The book looks at an election campaign dominated by bizarre events:</p>
<p>&#39;Paintergate&#39; * &#39;The Worm&#39; * &#39;Corngate&#39; * &#39;Bob the Builder&#39;</p>
<p>The 2002 election is called &#39;early&#39; but the government rejects claims it is a &#39;snap election&#39;. There is a police investigation of Prime Minister Helen Clark&#39;s signing of a painting that she hadn&#39;t painted. A book is released claiming a government cover-up of the release of GE corn seed into New Zealand. Prime Minister Clark is &#39;ambushed&#39; on television in a dramatic confrontation with TV3&#39;s John Campbell. The Alliance is annihilated, but Jim Anderton makes it back into Parliament. After 18 years in Parliament Peter Dunne becomes an overnight success. The &#39;worm&#39; returns. So does Winston Peters, in alliance with a cartoon character, &#39;Bob the Builder&#39;.</p>
<p>The election, from start to finish, is seen through the eyes of party strategists, candidates, journalists and scholars of New Zealand politics. Twenty-eight chapters discuss, analyse and interpret what happened and why. The key post-election events - the formation of a Labour-Progressive coalition with support from United Future and the Greens - are documented.</p>
<p>New Zealand Votes: The General Election of 2002 includes a special feature: a CD-Rom of debates and ads from the campaign - a vivid record of an unusual and colourful contest.</p>
<p>Jonathan Boston, Stephen Levine, Elizabeth McLeay and Nigel S. Roberts are all political scientists at the Victoria University of Wellington who have collaborated on a wide-ranging research project into the effects of MMP on New Zealand&#39;s government and politics. From 1999 to 2002 Stephen Church was a Research Fellow at the Victoria University of Wellington.</p>
