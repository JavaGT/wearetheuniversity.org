<p><strong>Wednesday, 17 December 2003, 8:19 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University_Students_Association">Lincoln University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Maharey more miserable than merry this Christmas</p>
<p>Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey has announced that the income thresholds for student loan repayments and interest write-offs will be raised.</p>
<p>“These increases are incredibly small - a meagre $4.00 per week extra a student can earn before they must start to repay their student loan or apply for an interest write-off.” Said Andrew Kirton, President of the Lincoln University Students’ Association.</p>
<p>Kirton said the changes will do next to nothing and the Minister’s attempt to be festive is like a bad Christmas joke.</p>
<p>“These changes are a drop in the ocean in terms of improving the lives of New Zealand tertiary students and addressing the monster of student debt.” Kirton said</p>
<p>He said that announcements such as these were insulting, especially when the income threshold for the student allowance has not increased since 1992, meaning less and less students remain eligible for financial support every year.</p>
<p>“Students are still the only group in this society who must borrow from the government to meet their cost of living. As a result, nearly half of all student debt is rent, food and other living expenses. This is simply not good enough.” Said Kirton.  </p>
