<p>Lindsay Tisch National Small Business Spokesman</p>

<p>Small business first to suffer from Holidays Act</p>
<p>It is the thousands of small business owners who will suffer first from the Government&#39;s Holidays Act, says National&#39;s Small Business spokesman Lindsay Tisch.</p>
<p>&quot;The Act, passed last night, will increase compliance costs for small businesses and cap future wage and salary rises for employees - costing New Zealanders $700 million a year.</p>
<p>&quot;Small businesses are already struggling - a recent Ministry of Economic Development report suggests that many small business owners take home around $31,000, that&#39;s less than the average wage,&quot; says Mr Tisch.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, paying for an extra week&#39;s leave, employees will have to cover eight weeks of non-work time per staff member.</p>
<p>&quot;Paying for four weeks&#39; annual leave plus 11 statutory holidays, five sick days and four bereavement days will take its toll on small business owners.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government&#39;s already burdened small business with a $40,000 bill for new compliance costs.</p>
<p>&quot;The thousands of entrepreneurial, hard-working Kiwis with small businesses who create jobs and fuel our economy are being pushed to the wall by Labour,&quot; says Mr Tisch.</p>
