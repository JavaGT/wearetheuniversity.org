<p><strong>Friday, 19 December 2003, 11:39 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Student_Choice">Student Choice</a></strong></p>
<p>Compulsory OUSA&#39;s income hiked 9% to $1.2 million</p>
<p>While the Otago University Students Association (OUSA) criticised Otago University for increasing its fees, the compulsory association&#39;s own income is budgeted to rise 9 percent to $1.2 million in 2004, Student Choice said.</p>
<p>OUSA&#39;s ratified budget for 2004 shows that OUSA&#39;s income from compulsory membership will rise from $1,118,082 this year to $1,216,000 next year, a 9 percent increase of $98,000. OUSA say the increase is a result of growth in student numbers.</p>
<p>Every Otago student is forced to pay a membership levy to OUSA. Under compulsory membership an increase in the number of students automatically means increased revenue for the association.</p>
<p>Student Choice says this is another example of how compulsory associations are not subject to normal commercial pressures. Compulsory membership, OUSA&#39;s monopoly status and the absence of a price mechanism means the association receives income regardless of how it performs and benefits from increased enrolments it has not helped generate.</p>
<p>Compulsory membership is virtually a licence to print money for associations. If OUSA was like other incorporated societies it would have to prove its value to students and sell membership at a market price.</p>
<p>Student Choice said OUSA&#39;s surplus of $330,000 in 2002 showed that the 9 percent increase was additional overcharging by an organisation that was already taking too much money from students.</p>
<p>Student politicians who complain about increases in tuition fees have no credibility when they support the imposition of unnecessary and excessive costs on students.</p>
