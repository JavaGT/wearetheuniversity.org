<p><strong>Friday, 19 December 2003, 10:18 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Student Leaders Deliver Letter to &quot;Santa&quot; Maharey</p>
<p>Student leaders in Christmas costume today delivered a letter to Santa, Tertiary Minister Steve Maharey, asking for more action on student support in the coming year.</p>
<p>Next year&#39;s leaders of the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA), Fleur Fitzsimons and her newly-elected Co-President Andrew Kirton, delivered a tinsel covered letter from students asking for a living allowance for all students to the steps of Parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;On behalf of all students, we&#39;ve asked Steve Maharey for the best Christmas present we can think of - living allowances for all,&quot; said Andrew Kirton. &quot;Thousands of students could really enjoy Christmas knowing that next year they wouldn&#39;t have to borrow from the student loans scheme to pay their rent and buy food.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re also letting him know that if he doesn&#39;t deliver on his promise to make tertiary education more affordable that students could be naughty not nice in 2004,&quot; said Fleur Fitzsimons. &quot;Students are getting increasingly angry about Labour&#39;s failure to fix the disastrous student loan scheme.&quot;</p>
<p>Andrew Kirton, this year&#39;s President of the Lincoln University Students&#39; Association, was elected to the position of 2004 Co-President yesterday. He joins 2004 Co-President Fleur Fitzsimons and National Women&#39;s Rights Officer Camilla Belich, who were elected in September.  </p>
