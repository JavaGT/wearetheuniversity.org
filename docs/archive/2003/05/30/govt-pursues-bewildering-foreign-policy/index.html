<p><strong>Friday, 30 May 2003, 4:47 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Govt pursues bewildering foreign policy</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Phil Goff should be focussing on issues in his own back yard rather than holding hands with Yasser Arafat, according to National Party Foreign Affairs spokesman Dr Wayne Mapp.</p>
<p>&quot;For instance, what is the Minister doing about lawlessness and the breakdown of civil Government in the Solomons?&quot; asks Dr Mapp.</p>
<p>&quot;The Labour Government has clearly lost all sight of what is in New Zealand&#39;s national interests, instead Helen Clark and Mr Goff are reliving their radical student days.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Goff should be looking to repair the damage that both he and the Prime Minister are responsible for,&quot; Dr Mapp says.</p>
<p>&quot;The actions of both will almost certainly serve to further isolate New Zealand from its traditional friends and allies.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s simply not good enough for Mr Goff to ignore appeals from the Israeli Government not to meet with Yasser Arafat, when the peace process is so delicately poised,&quot; Dr Mapp says.</p>
<p>&quot;What does Mr Goff hope to achieve with his ill-timed and ill-considered visit to Ramallah?</p>
<p>&quot;The Government must now consider what can be done to repair the damage, the time for photo opportunities is over.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time for the hard work to start,&quot; Dr Mapp says.</p>
