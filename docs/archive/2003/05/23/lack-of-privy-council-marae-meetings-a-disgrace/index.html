<p>Lack Of Privy Council Marae Meetings A Disgrace</p>
<p>A decision by the justice and electoral select committee chairman not to hold a hui on various Marae to discuss the abolition of the Privy Council as New Zealand’s last court of appeal is a disgrace, said New Zealand First spokesperson Dail Jones.</p>
<p>He was commenting on the draft timetable for the committee which brings to a close the hearing of evidence at 7.00pm on Wednesday 28th May and for the next stage of the bill to commence that same evening.</p>
<p>“This is a gross insult to Maori who have asked for meetings to be heard on their marae and have been refused their democratic right by Labour, United Future and the Greens.</p>
<p>”It shows that the Government is determined to abolish the Privy Council regardless of the overwhelming opposition indicated by the submissions,” said Mr Jones.</p>
<p>“It is clear that a referendum shall be held on this matter but the Government is running scared on the issue and does not wish the people to express their view by way of referendum.”</p>
<p>Mr Jones said it was disgraceful that this major constitutional issue was being decided at the whim of an Attorney-General and Prime Minister who had decided during their university days that New Zealand should become a Republic.</p>
<p>“Neither of these people have ever had to make their way in the real world – and it shows,” he said.  </p>
