<p>NZEI Supports Extra Education Funding</p>
<p>Wellington – The country’s largest education union, NZEI Te Riu, welcomes the government’s extra funding for early childhood education, literacy teaching in primary schools, and for information and communications technology (ICT) for all schools.</p>
<p>The union has 42,000 members working as teachers in early childhood education, as teachers and principals in the primary sector, as support staff in all schools, as advisers in the school advisory service, and staff in special education.</p>
<p>“NZEI Te Riu welcomes the extra education funding announced in The Budget this afternoon. In particular the extra $55 million for early childhood education, the $15 million for literacy teaching in primary schools, and the $78 million for ICT in all schools,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Bruce Adin.</p>
<p>EARLY CHILDHOOD “The union supports the government’s commitment to ensuring children have access to quality early childhood education. Research shows how important this is and our members in the sector are working hard to ensure the children they teach get the best possible start to their education,” says Mr Adin.</p>
<p>LITERACY TEACHING “In a recent reading study more than a third of the primary children returned scores that put them in the top bracket internationally. However a sizeable proportion were in the bottom quarter of the study. The extra funding for literacy teaching in The Budget will help extend the work that is already being done to help students who have difficulty learning to read and write,” says Bruce Adin.</p>

<p>ICT FUNDING “The extra funding is welcomed. It is vital our schools are well equipped when it comes to ICT so that the students are able to equip themselves with the skills they will need to lead productive lives in the 21st century,” says Mr Adin.</p>
<p>SCHOOL OPERATION FUNDING “A disappointing aspect of the Budget is the low increase in the operational funding for primary schools. There is an increase of only 2% per pupil which will barely cover inflation,” says Bruce Adin.</p>
<p>“The extra funding for early childhood education, literacy teaching and ICT announced this afternoon comes on top of the $167 million for 774 more teachers announced two week ago. NZEI Te Riu Roa applauds the government for this investment in education that will benefit the whole country,” says Bruce Adin CONTACTS: NZEI National President Bruce Adin 04 382-2723 (wk), 027 274-7902, 027 274-7902, 04 381-4696 (a/h WGTN) 09 299-7538 (a/h AKLD) NZEI Te Riu Roa National Secretary Lynne Bruce, 04 382-2720 (wk) 027 274-7902, 04 475-3797 (a/h) NZEI Te Riu Roa Communications Officer, Nick Hirst 04 382-2703 (wk) 027 268-3291, 04 479-9089 (a/h)  </p>
