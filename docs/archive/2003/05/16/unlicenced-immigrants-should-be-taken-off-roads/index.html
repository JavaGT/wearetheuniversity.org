<p>Mark Calls For Unlicenced Immigrants To Be Taken Off Roads</p>
<p>New Zealand First law and order spokesperson Ron Mark today urged the Government to act now to keep foreign students and new immigrants off the roads until they meet New Zealand’s driving licence standards.</p>
<p>This follows the case of an unlicenced foreign student being sentenced to two years jail for causing the death of a four-year-old girl at Rangiriri in February.</p>
<p>“The sentence was too light and the student should have been made to serve it in a prison in his home country, but the real issue is that he should never have been behind the wheel of a car in this country,” said Mr Mark</p>
<p>“The Government has treated ongoing reports of foreigners cheating during drivers licence testing, and the use of fraudulent licences with a cavalier attitude and must bear some responsibility for the current mayhem on our roads”</p>
<p>“There are probably hundreds of these people on our roads and the Government must act quickly to ensure no more New Zealanders are killed by ineligible foreign drivers,” said Mr Mark.  </p>
