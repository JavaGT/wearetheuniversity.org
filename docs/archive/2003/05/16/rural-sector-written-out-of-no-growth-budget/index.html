<p><strong>Friday, 16 May 2003, 9:34 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Rural sector written out of &#39;no growth&#39; Budget</p>
<p>The Labour Government has again shown its true colours, proving it is no friend of the farming sector, according to National Party Rural Affairs spokesman Shane Ardern.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite increasing costs, a decline in farm payouts, disappearing medical cover and an Auckland road tax, the rural community&#39;s been left out in the cold by Labour&#39;s &#39;no growth&#39; Budget.</p>
<p>&quot;It should now be obvious to the rural sector that this Government has no intention of assisting the one group which provides them with the money to produce a surplus in the first place,&quot; says Mr Ardern.</p>
<p>&quot;Our medical services continue to decline, with thousands being taken off waiting lists and referred back to their increasingly busy doctor.</p>
<p>&quot;Our rural schools are being closed as the Minister of Education continues his &#39;witch-hunt&#39; to shut down small schools in a misguided attempt to save money.</p>
<p>&quot;Meanwhile, those schools lucky enough to stay open have had funding and school bus service cuts - but it&#39;s quite clear that this Government doesn&#39;t care,&quot; says Mr Ardern.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing for us, but millions for the America&#39;s Cup and $75.9m for the Arts - where are Labour&#39;s priorities?</p>
<p>&quot;This Budget has obviously been written by Wellington bureaucrats who have no understanding of rural life.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#39;ve shown a lack of judgement when it comes to where money should be spent and failed to identify who is helping to drive the economy,&quot; says Mr Ardern.</p>
<p>&quot;Part of the surplus should have been spent on the urgent needs facing our communities, not on touchy, &#39;feel good&#39; programmes that will do nothing to improve New Zealand&#39;s economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop turning a blind eye and put the money into the rural sector before it is too late!&quot; Mr Ardern says.</p>
