<p><strong>Wednesday, 28 May 2003, 3:13 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour imposes its PC agenda on roading</p>
<p>The National Party is questioning the $600,000 being spent by the Government commissioning research on Maori knowledge and values in roading.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a classic case of PC madness,&quot; says National Party Transport spokesman Roger Sowry.</p>
<p>&quot;Why should Maori &#39;knowledge and values in roading&#39; be any more important than the values placed on roading by the rest of the travelling public.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not about stopping another &#39;Taniwha&#39; from holding up highway projects, the Government gave them that right in RMA legislation that demands consultation,&quot; Mr Sowry says.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Party is also suspicious about how much difference the research will make, when we&#39;ve obtained documents that show some Maori have three rules when responding to resource consent applications.</p>
<p>&quot;They are, object, object and object again,&quot; says Mr Sowry.</p>
<p>&quot;With that sort of approach to the established consultation process, what will the $600,000 taxpayer funded research achieve?</p>
<p>&quot;That money would have been better spent improving roads.</p>
<p>&quot;Local authorities throughout New Zealand already spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a year consulting with Maori groups in their areas,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite that commitment to Maori consultation, many projects are still hamstrung by objections, often on mischievous grounds.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government must put an end to its politically correct consultation agenda, which is more clear evidence of Labour&#39;s policy of division,&quot; says Mr Sowry.</p>
