<p><strong>Wednesday, 28 May 2003, 12:08 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National will stop growing welfare dependency</p>
<p>There will always be a welfare safety net in New Zealand. National believes in this and I want to emphasise that at the very outset, National Social Welfare spokesperson Katherine Rich said today in releasing her discussion paper Saving the next generation from welfare dependency.</p>
<p>&quot;But rather than being part of the solution, the present welfare state has become part of the problem,&quot; Mrs Rich said. &quot;The Labour Government is ignoring the growing welfare dependency problem. National is the only broad-based political party prepared to tackle it, and harness our potential, for the benefit of all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;National believes the growing dependency on welfare in New Zealand is adversely affecting the well-being of hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders. We have to find a better solution. Welfare dependency wrecks lives.</p>
<p>&quot;Few have stopped to question why, after three years of the best economic conditions in a generation, welfare dependency is escalating. Without significant welfare reform, New Zealand has no chance of reducing this growth,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The paper discusses welfare ideas from Australia, Canada, the United States and the UK and follows months of research. &quot;While these countries are having success in implementing a number of new ideas, the New Zealand Government is taking New Zealand down the opposite path towards greater welfare dependency.</p>
<p>&quot;The measures I have raised, which include greater assistance for teenage mothers, time-limited benefits and work for the dole, are aimed at reducing dependency and improving well-being. &quot;I understand that there are some welfare recipients who will never work, due to mental or physical disability, but for others the welfare system should be seen as a safety net offering temporary support before they get back to work.</p>
<p>Mrs Rich said remaining on welfare long-term was damaging to people&#39;s lives, but moving off welfare and into work built self-esteem, increased incomes and created further opportunities for employment.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s goals are simple: reduce dependency and improve wellbeing. This minority government is ignoring the coming crisis in welfare dependency. Only National is prepared to tackle it, and make a difference for the benefit of all New Zealanders,&quot; Mr Rich she said.</p>
