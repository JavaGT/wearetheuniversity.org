<p><strong>Thursday, 15 May 2003, 4:03 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Lights dim on Labour in &#39;do nothing&#39; budget</p>
<p>National Party Leader Bill English says Michael Cullen&#39;s 4th Budget charts a course that leads New Zealand down the road to nowhere.</p>
<p>&quot;Where are the initiatives that would promote economic growth?&quot; asks Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;The New Zealand business community is being strangled by an increasing amount of red tape, this budget claims a victory for them - but delivers nothing of substance.</p>
<p>&quot;Where is the promised relief for our tertiary students?</p>
<p>&quot;Instead the Government&#39;s paved the way for huge fee increases.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than targeting our long term growth, this Government is putting its surplus in a war-chest so it can buy votes ahead of the next election.</p>
<p>&quot;Michael Cullen won&#39;t hand any of it back by way of tax breaks, he doesn&#39;t trust New Zealanders to make their own spending decisions.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a &#39;rainy day&#39; budget, it&#39;s a budget that will allow Labour to reward its loyal servants in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;How can Labour justify a policy that could lead to big student fee increases, when it&#39;s stashing increasingly vast amounts of money into an account that will be plundered ahead of the next election?</p>
<p>&quot;The Government&#39;s doing nothing to remove the impediments to economic growth, while the number of people on welfare is forecast to grow year upon year.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ll all be paying for the electricity crisis too, by way of a Helen Clark energy levy, but the Government&#39;s found millions more to spend on the Treaty industry, including $6.5 million on an information campaign,&quot; Mr English says.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the Budget of an increasingly dishonest Government, one that doesn&#39;t know what &#39;smarter growth&#39; is let alone how to make sure it happens.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#39;s worse is they&#39;re already conceding defeat and all New Zealanders will pay the price for that,&quot; Mr English says.  </p>
