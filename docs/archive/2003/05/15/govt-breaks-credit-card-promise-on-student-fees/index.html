<p><strong>Thursday, 15 May 2003, 3:55 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Govt breaks credit card promise on student fees</p>
<p>The Government has broken yet another one of the promises it made to students ahead of the last two elections, says National Party Tertiary Education spokesman Simon Power. &quot;Today&#39;s budget announcement on fees will inevitably lead to increases for students throughout the country.</p>
<p>&quot;The fee maxima programme offers no protection to students, and shows that the Government is more intent on maintaining the bureaucracy than improving the student&#39;s lot.</p>
<p>&quot;In its second term, the Government should have been able to offer some relief to students,&quot; says Mr Power.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead Labour&#39;s conveniently forgotten its pledge cards of the past two elections.</p>
<p>&quot;In 2002 it promised &#39;to keep tertiary education affordable&#39; - selective memory strikes again.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government can not be trusted,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently an Otago student studying for a BA would pay $2950 in course fees.</p>
<p>&quot;The scheme announced in the budget now sets the maximum for that same course at $3900, leaving room for a potential increase of up to a thousand dollars,&quot; says Mr Power.</p>
<p>&quot;In Auckland, the rise could be as much as $600, at Victoria $900 and Canterbury around $500.</p>
<p>&quot;Take Engineering where fee maxima will set the top fee at $5000.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently students completing an engineering degree pay between $4,200 and $4,500.</p>
<p>&quot;Student anger is justified, when the Minister abuses their trust, breaks another promise and wastes more opportunities,&quot; Mr Power says.</p>
