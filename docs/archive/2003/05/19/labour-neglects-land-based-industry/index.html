<p>Labour Neglects Land-Based Industry</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Rural Affairs Spokesman Gerry Eckhoff today congratulated Massey University Professor Ian Warrington for challenging the Labour Government&#39;s leadership of New Zealand&#39;s farming industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Warrington&#39;s comments are especially courageous, given Prime Minister Helen Clark&#39;s penchant for whacking those who speak out against inadequate governance,&quot; Mr Eckhoff said.</p>
<p>&quot;The land-based industry is the foundation of New Zealand&#39;s wealth creation, yet it is constantly ignored by the Labour Government. It is quite pitiful to watch the Government&#39;s `progress&#39; in issues such as unemployment, yet totally ignore the contribution of rural New Zealand, which this and past Governments have described as a sunset industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is almost criminally negligent in its steadfast refusal to adequately fund the ultimate public good - bio-security. Jim Sutton is wholly responsible as the Minister of Rural Affairs and Bio security, yet is totally ineffectual as the advocate for land-based industry within Cabinet. Dr Warrington is absolutely correct to insist that the government has its priorities all wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;Ms Clark should replace Mr Sutton as the Rural Affairs Minister, and allow him to concentrate full-time on trade. It appears nobody in Cabinet has the wit to understand just how crucial rural New Zealand is to the New Zealand economy, past, present and future,&quot; Mr Eckhoff said.  </p>
