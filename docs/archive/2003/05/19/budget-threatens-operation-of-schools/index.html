<p>Budget Threatens Operation Of Schools</p>
<p>Wellington – NZEI Te Riu says the Government is failing to provide enough money to cover the cost of running the country’s schools.</p>
<p>“The government is continually asking schools to do more to meet the educational needs of our children but it is failing to provide the money to cover the costs of running a school,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Bruce Adin.</p>
<p>“The Budget increased operational funding for schools by only 1.8%. Inflation is running at 2.5%, so that amounts to a cut in the money schools have to meet their core costs,” says Bruce Adin.</p>
<p>Schools use their operational funding grants to cover costs such as maintaining school buildings, which includes paying for caretakers and cleaners, and employing support staff such as secretaries, executive officers and IT technicians.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa represents 9000 support staff who work in primary, intermediate, area and secondary schools.</p>
<p>“The union has a real concern that their jobs, pay and conditions are under threat because the Government did not provide enough money in the Budget to adequately cover their employment,” says Bruce Adin.</p>
<p>“Support staff such as secretaries and executive officers are essential to the smooth running of schools, while librarians and IT technicians are increasingly important in giving students the skills needed to build a knowledge economy.”</p>
<p>“If the government is serious in wanting to build a knowledge economy it has to ensure that schools are funded adequately. That means they have the money to pay for basics like building maintenance and employing the staff that run schools and help equip students for the 21st century,” says Bruce Adin.  </p>
