<p><strong>Thursday, 1 May 2003, 10:58 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Business picks up tab for failing education system</p>
<p>The National Party is voicing its concern over a Government initiative that leaves business picking up more of the tab for industry training.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a sad indictment on our compulsory education sector that business is now expected to take up the slack in the training of our young,&quot; says the National Party Tertiary Education spokesman Simon Power.</p>
<p>He&#39;s commenting on the Government&#39;s pre-budget announcement of an $800,000 industry-training package.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s disappointing that businesses can no longer expect school leavers to have the basic numeracy and literacy skills needed to be successful in any work-place.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the National Party is pleased that its initiatives of the 90&#39;s are being continued by the Labour Government,&quot; says Mr Power. &quot;But it&#39;s important the industry training initiatives are properly resourced and deliver what was promised.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Party&#39;s concerned that too many of this Government&#39;s programmes are not being monitored or subjected to adequate checks and balances,&quot; Mr Power says.</p>
<p>&quot;The real shame is that with this Government&#39;s anti-business policies, there&#39;s likely to be fewer industries for these trainees to join.</p>
<p>&quot;The electricity crisis, OSH laws, the RMA, the Holidays Act and the Kyoto protocol are all taking a toll on New Zealand business, which is in the throes of a confidence slump.</p>
<p>&quot;The latest trade figures also make grim reading.</p>
<p>&quot;Without an environment that allows industry to prosper, success in industry training will be more difficult,&quot; Mr Power says.</p>
