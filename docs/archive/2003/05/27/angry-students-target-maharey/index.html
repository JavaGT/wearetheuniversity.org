<p><strong>Tuesday, 27 May 2003, 2:31 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Angry students target Maharey</p>
<p>Formerly &quot;student friendly&quot; Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey will be facing angry students again today in Wellington, following protests in Palmerston North, Auckland and Dunedin.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey is being faced with student fury about fee maxima everywhere he goes,&quot; said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA) &quot;The proposed fee rises are drawing out placard waving students and scary debt monsters all over the country.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is making the student debt crisis that faces New Zealand even worse by allowing fees to increase. Fee rises will add to our $5.5 billion dollar debt and lengthen repayment times for graduates,&quot; said Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>&quot;The predictability that Labour promised in tertiary fees is horribly familiar,&quot; said Fitzsimons. &quot;Labour seem to be delivering an annual fee increase just like the National Party did in the 90s.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey needs to admit that the government has made a terrible mistake by setting the fee maxima levels so high and excluding postgraduates from fee regulation. It&#39;s not too late for him to lower fee maxima and honour his election promise.&quot;</p>
<p>Note: Students will be protesting from 3:30 pm in the Hunter Courtyard, Victoria University.  </p>
