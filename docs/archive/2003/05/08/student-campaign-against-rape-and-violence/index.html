<p><strong>Thursday, 8 May 2003, 9:12 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Student campaign against rape and violence re-launched</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) is re-launching its national campaign against rape and violence &#39;Thursdays in Black&#39; on Thursday 8 May. This includes a national action of a minute of silence to remember the survivors of rape and violence throughout history. This will take place at 3pm this Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Wearing black on Thursdays is one way women students are protesting against war,&quot; said Camilla Belich, NZUSA National Women&#39;s Rights Officer.</p>
<p>&#39;Thursdays in Black&#39; invites all people in New Zealand to wear black on Thursdays indicating their demand for a world without rape, violence and discrimination. The campaign is based on opposition to all violence - whether it is unjust wars or domestic violence.</p>
<p>&quot;The campaign focuses on ways that the individual can challenge attitudes to rape and violence. It challenges the existing social taboos associated particularly with rape and domestic violence,&quot; said Belich.</p>
<p>&#39;Thursdays in Black&#39; was started by groups like Mothers for the Disappeared in Argentina, Black Sash in South Africa and the Women in Black movements in Israel-Palestine and the former Yugoslavia. The World Council of Churches has also been involved in facilitating the campaign internationally.</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students&#39; Association and the Tertiary Women&#39;s Focus Group are proud to run this campaign in New Zealand. &quot;Wearing black on a Thursday is a gesture of solidarity for all women, men and children who are outraged by the incidences of rape and violence that happen in our communities.&quot;</p>
<p>Campus women&#39;s groups from NZUSA constituent associations will be organising actions to publicise the campaign.</p>
