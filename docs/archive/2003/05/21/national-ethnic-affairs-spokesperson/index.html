<p>Asian communities want more police on the beat</p>
<p>Claims that an Asian student crimewave is sweeping the streets of Auckland have angered National&#39;s Ethnic Affairs spokesperson, Pansy Wong.</p>
<p>&quot;Asian communities, like all communities in Auckland, are concerned that police in our largest city are struggling because they&#39;re seriously under-resourced and understaffed.</p>
<p>&quot;The last thing Asians living here want is New Zealand to be seen as a soft touch for criminals. Asian communities have long called for tougher sentencing and more police on the beat,&quot; says Mrs Wong.</p>
<p>She says it shouldn&#39;t be forgotten that Asian students are often the victims of crime.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether the offenders are Asian or not, Asian communities still expect these people to be dealt with properly by our police and justice system.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem here is a police force in Auckland stretched to the limit trying to handle a staggering workload. All the Government&#39;s come up with in the Budget is a few extra police that won&#39;t even replace the number of officers leaving the force.</p>
<p>&quot;I am still waiting for Labour to put resources into implementing the Auckland City District Police - Asian Responsiveness Strategic Plan which was drawn up between the police and Asian community representatives 2 ½ years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Meanwhile, I have no hesitation accepting Senior Constable Steve Lamb&#39;s suggestion of patrolling Auckland streets with police one evening to see first-hand what they are dealing with,&quot; says Mrs Wong.</p>
