<p>Is Honesty No Longer The Policy Of The Police? Asks Peters</p>
<p>New Zealand First has accused the Government of trying to cover up the level of Asian student crime in Auckland and silencing a police officer who went public with the problem.</p>
<p>Senior Constable Steve Lamb reportedly wrote to the New Zealand Herald, saying he may not be able to respond to calls from the public while patrolling downtown because he was dealing with crime committed by Chinese students.</p>
<p>&quot;It is because I&#39;m attending the results of what some of them study,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Theft, fraud, fighting, assault, intimidation, vehicle crashes, drunkenness, disorder, domestics, stabbings and a sideline of extortion and weapon- carrying.&quot;</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters said the police officer had merely confirmed what New Zealand First had been pointing out to the Government publicly for more than a year.</p>
<p>“Only a fortnight ago, Phil Goff was boasting in Parliament about the low level of Asian crime, it was obvious that he had never been in contact with frontline police dealing with it.</p>
<p>“Imported crime is rife in Auckland with Asian gangs operating at will because of language and cultural barriers and scarce police resources.</p>
<p>“Unlimited immigration and an explosion of student numbers means that there are no controls in place to weed out these gangsters before they arrive here.</p>
<p>“Auckland is fast becoming a lawless Asian colony and law abiding, decent New Zealanders in that city are paying the price for it.</p>
<p>“I am not at all impressed by the efforts of Senior Constable Lamb’s superiors though, who have elected to follow the lead of the present Government and its ineffective Minister of Police, in shooting the messenger rather than listening to the message,” said Mr Peters.  </p>
