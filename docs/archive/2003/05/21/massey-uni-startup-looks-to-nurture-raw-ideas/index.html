<p>Massey Uni Startup Looks To Nurture &#39;Raw Ideas&#39;</p>
<p>Massey University is about to launch the country&#39;s first university-linked campus-based pre-incubator think tank, but potential new business ideas are already flowing in well ahead of the official May-end opening.</p>
<p>The e-centre StartUp project will help nurture &#39;raw ideas&#39; from university students, researchers and associated partners such as Tindall Foundation&#39;s &#39;ideas.org&#39;, putting them through an evaluation and assessment process designed to prepare them for entry into the Albany campus-based e-centre.</p>
<p>The initiative, designed to spin businesses out of university know-how, is a pilot scheme collaboration between the e-centre and the University&#39;s Colleges of Business and College of Science.</p>
<p>The University is sponsoring the pilot and grants from government business agencies will also provide funding.</p>
<p>Steve Corbett, e-centre Manager, says the knowledge base on Massey University&#39;s Albany campus has significant potential for creating new businesses in high value areas such as ICT, mechatronics, robotics, biotechnology and food technology.</p>
<p>&quot;StartUp will capture and accelerate ideas into a business by simplifying the whole process of identifying and nurturing good ideas that have potential to turn into commercially viable businesses&quot;.</p>
<p>He says the unique factor is the involvement of the University&#39;s Institute of Technology and Engineering and Business College, which will carry out both technology and market assessments for ideas that have passed the initial commercialisation potential screening test.</p>

<p>Dr Chris Kirk, Director of Research and Innovation at Massey and e-Centre Board Director, says that the support of the Pro Vice-Chancellors of Science and Business was crucial to the initiative. He says, &quot;Smart people and smart ideas - they are the raw ingredients of an enterprise economy. This pre-incubator will fast-track the best proposals into embryonic business ventures&quot;.</p>
<p>Mr Corbett says dedicated space has been put aside in the e-centre to provide a hothouse for the bright ideas that will form the basis of StartUp&#39;s think tank.</p>
<p>&quot;Once they are given the green light, participants will work with business experts to build the commercial case with a view to moving on to the e-centre for business acceleration. Essentially, we are taking the whole process of identifying and nurturing talent into enterprise a step further, by taking one step backwards - where the good ideas often founder for lack of support.&quot;</p>
<p>The e-centre has added two new commercial directors to the board to assist in business acceleration; they are IRL&#39;s Nigel Kirkpatrick and Westpac&#39;s June McCabe.</p>
