<p>Imported Crime Increasing Says Mark</p>
<p>Asian crime is spiraling out of control and the Government is continuing to try to hush it up claims New Zealand First law and order spokesperson Ron Mark.</p>
<p>“Dishonesty crimes committed amongst Asiatic ethnic groups have risen by 200 percent over the last five years, while it has dropped for other ethnic groups,” said Mr Mark.</p>
<p>“Police officers and judges are now voicing their concern over the increase in crime amongst Asians with Judge Cecilie Rushton quoted in today’s New Zealand Herald as saying, “hardly a week goes by in this court without a case involving the kidnap of a Chinese student and a ransom demand.</p>
<p>“The Government can no longer ignore this increasing problem with figures showing that violent crime amongst Asians has risen by 67 percent. The average increase amongst other ethnic groups is 7.6 percent.</p>
<p>“The number of crimes committed by Asian offenders has risen by 77 percent in the last five years, with the average less than four percent for other groups.</p>
<p>“Why is the Government refusing to address this problem? Because they are more interested in the artificial economic boom created by importing Asian students.</p>
<p>“The only thing that is being created is more work for our already under-resourced police and judicial system,” said Mr Mark.  </p>
