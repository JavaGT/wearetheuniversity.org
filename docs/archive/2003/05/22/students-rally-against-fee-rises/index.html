<p>Students rally against fee rises</p>
<p>Steve Maharey faced angry students at the Auckland University of Technology (AUT) today during a forum, held to inform staff about reforms in the tertiary education sector. &quot;Students are furious that this Government is allowing tertiary institutions to raise fees, and that they have so clearly broken their pledge card election promise to keep tertiary education affordable,&quot; said Elliot Roberts, President of the Auckland Student Movement at AUT.</p>
<p>In scenes reminiscent of student protests during the 1990s, students held placards and banners with messages like: Fee rises = Labour betrayal; Fight the war on fees and Labour pledge card worthless! &quot;This will be the beginning of many such protests in Auckland as students realise the full significance of the high fee maxima that the government has set,&quot; said Roberts.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour always say that they want to attract more students into teacher education however higher fees for teacher training courses will make this much harder,&quot; said President of the Auckland College of Education Students&#39; Association Rachel Lynch.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s fee rises will be remembered as the point where the Labour Government turned its back on students and ignored the disastrous effects of the loan scheme on New Zealand society,&quot; said Lynch.</p>
<p>&quot;Maharey&#39;s claim on budget day that he expects institutions not to raise fees to the maxima is nonsense Already the Vice Chancellor at Auckland is saying that he can&#39;t raise fees high enough!&quot; said Scott Kelly, President of the Auckland University Students&#39; Association.</p>
<p>&quot;Students have spoken loud and clear to the Minister. We cannot afford fee increases, more student debt and even longer repayment times. Now he needs to respond,&quot; said Roberts.  </p>
