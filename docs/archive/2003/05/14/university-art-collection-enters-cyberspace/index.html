<p>University Art Collection Enters Cyberspace</p>
<p>An Internet connection is now all anyone needs to view the work of selected New Zealand artists from the Victoria University Art Collection - with a newly established education resource featuring key artworks from the Collection now online.</p>
<p>The VUW Online Collection Tour has been set up by the University&#39;s Adam Art Gallery, which cares for the more than 240 works in Victoria&#39;s Collection, which is displayed throughout the University’s campuses.</p>
<p>The Online Collection Tour includes works by Colin McCahon, Doris Lusk, Robyn Kahukiwa, Emily Karaka, Ralph Hotere, Robin White, Gretchen Albrecht, Jacqueline Fahey and Philip Clairmont.</p>
<p>Gallery Director Sophie McIntyre says the Online Collection Tour is designed to provide secondary school students – particularly those from rural schools and centres beyond the Wellington region – with an equal opportunity to work with the University&#39;s art collection and related resources.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe these works are an important part of New Zealand&#39;s cultural heritage and should be accessible to everyone, regardless of where they live.”</p>
<p>&quot;The artworks and introductory information presented in the Online Collection Tour are particularly relevant for students studying either Bursary Art or Art History. The site is a valuable tool for students working from home or classroom computers.”</p>
<p>&quot;By encouraging students to examine and interpret artworks by important New Zealand artists, the Online Collection Tour aims to develop their knowledge of Modern New Zealand.&quot; Sophie McIntyre says as well as offering images and informative texts, the Online Tour encourages students to extend their learning by providing a comprehensive bibliography of New Zealand art books, catalogues and artist focused questions to which students are invited to respond.</p>
