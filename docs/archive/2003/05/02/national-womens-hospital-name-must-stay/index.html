<p><strong>Friday, 2 May 2003, 11:23 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National Women&#39;s Hospital name must stay</p>
<p>The name &quot;National Women&#39;s&quot; Hospital must stay, according to National MP and former National Women&#39;s obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no doubt that Wayne Brown and the Auckland Hospital Board have got it wrong, again. They must gracefully back down,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;National Women&#39;s has been driven by hundreds of dedicated doctors and nurses and successfully helped thousands of New Zealanders from birthing to cancer treatment. Losing the name would be a slight to the memory of thousands of passionate and dedicated New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>National Women&#39;s Hospital was set up as a national referral centre of excellence and it has been a National teaching hospital not only for New Zealanders, but postgraduates throughout the Pacific and the world.</p>
<p>As a research centre National Women&#39;s has a national and international reputation for ground breaking work, such as that carried out by Sir William Liley on fetal transfusion and Sir Graham Liggin&#39;s on the cause and treatment of premature labour.</p>
<p>&quot;The present Government say it is interested in consultation, accountability and developing a sense of national identify. If the Prime Minister and her government have any sense of national identity they will listen to the thousands of voices that are calling for the retention of the name &#39;National Women&#39;s&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;When the Auckland Hospital Board first mooted the change to the new site they gave a promise that the name of National Women&#39;s would not be lost but would only be strengthened by the closer association with the medical school.</p>
<p>&quot;Wayne Brown and the Auckland Hospital Board have been submerged in a morass of deficits and management change. They would be wise to preserve New Zealand icons such as &#39;the Starship&#39;, &#39;Greenlane Hospital&#39; and &#39;National Women&#39;s Hospital&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Wayne Brown has an enthusiasm for surfing - perhaps he has banged his head on his surfboard and lost his senses,&quot; said Dr Hutchison.  </p>
