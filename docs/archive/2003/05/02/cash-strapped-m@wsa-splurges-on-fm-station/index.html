<p>&#39;Cash-Strapped&#39; M@Wsa Splurges On Fm Station</p>
<p>Just over a month after being bailed out by a $180,000 loan from Massey University to overcome financial difficulties, M@WSA, the compulsory student association at Massey University Wellington, has found enough money to set up an FM radio station, Student Choice said today.</p>
<p>Massey University at Wellington Students Association (M@WSA) is funded through a compulsory levy on all Massey Wellington students which costs them over $350,000 a year, Student Choice spokesman Clint Heine said.</p>
<p>In March this year compulsory M@WSA received a loan from Massey University to overcome cash flow problems caused by fraud of over $100,000. Massey University registrar Adrienne Cleland justified the $180,000 loan on the grounds that it would help M@WSA overcome its &quot;present difficulties&quot;.</p>
<p>Yet despite its supposed financial difficulties, this week M@WSA, along with funding from Massey University itself, launched an FM radio station on 107.4FM.</p>
<p>Heine said the launch of the radio station raises a number of important questions. &quot;If M@WSA has enough money to get into the expensive business of broadcasting, why did it need a loan from Massey University? How much is the radio station budgeted to cost? And why is Massey University using taxpayer and student money to fund a radio station that has nothing to do with its core business of teaching and research?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Massey University council needs to explain if it knew about the expenditure on the radio station when it decided to lend M@WSA $180,000. And how can Massey University complain about a lack of taxpayer funding when it has enough money to make a large loan to a student group with substantial guaranteed income, plus fund a non-essential radio station?&quot; Heine asked.</p>
<p>Both Massey University and M@WSA are obviously flush with cash taken from long-suffering students and taxpayers, Heine said.</p>
