<p>Public Money Down the Gurgler</p>
<p>Massey University&#39;s decision to loan $180,000 to a &quot;fraud-stricken&quot; student union is indefensible, ACT New Zealand Tertiary Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The average student, who couldn&#39;t give a stuff about union politics, will gain nothing from this loan. In fact, the average student will lose out, because this is money that should be spent on their education.</p>
<p>&quot;Massey University @ Wellington Students Association (M@WSA) has lost $100,000 to fraud. To most, that would suggest that loaning public money to the organisation isn&#39;t a particularly bright idea. The compulsory union is an incorporated society. It has nothing to do with providing teaching or research.</p>
<p>&quot;How on earth can Massey University dish out this cash, then claim it is &quot;underfunded&quot;? It may as well flush $180,000 down the gurgler.</p>
<p>&quot;Education Minister Steve Maharey made it possible for unions like M@WSA to become compulsory. Forcing students to cough up cash to join a &quot;fraud-stricken&quot; union is ridiculous. Now that Orientation Week is over, 90 percent of students aren&#39;t interested in the union&#39;s services - they&#39;d far rather have their money back,&quot; Miss Coddington said.  </p>
