<p>Asian Survey Result Sad But Predictable</p>
<p>New Zealand First has described the results of a Human Rights Commission survey that identified Asians as the group most discriminated against as “sad but predictable”.</p>
<p>Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters said tonight that the research result was inevitable given the flood of mainly Asian immigrants that the Government had brought into New Zealand last year.</p>
<p>“Research throughout the world on this subject has shown the same result. It is madness to flood a country with thousands of people from a totally foreign country and not expect some backlash.</p>
<p>“The people to blame for this are Helen Clark and Lianne Dalziel. Their cheerleader, Joris de Bres, is blaming ordinary New Zealanders for becoming alarmed about a situation over which they feel powerless.</p>
<p>Mr Peters said a sensible population policy would mean fewer migrants who would have a better chance of blending with New Zealand society with a minimum of stress.</p>
<p>“The situation is going to get a lot worse unless the Government acts promptly,” he said.  </p>
