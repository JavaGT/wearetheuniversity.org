<p><strong>Monday, 3 March 2003, 8:55 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Greens tell Howard: &#39;Stay home&#39;</p>
<p>The Green Party is asking the Government to withdraw the invitation for Australian Prime Minister John Howard to visit New Zealand next week.</p>
<p>&quot;Our Government should be sending the strongest possible message to this warmonger,&quot; said Green Co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons today. &quot;Howard&#39;s actions have stripped him of any right to the courtesy normally owed to a visiting dignitary.</p>
<p>&quot;This so-called &#39;leader&#39; has divided his own country by signing-up for Bush&#39;s War for Oil against Iraq without any public consultation or Parliamentary debate.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the Prime Minister who casually dismissed the hundreds of thousands of Australians who have taken to the streets to protest against war as a &#39;mob&#39; and then insulted them further by accusing them of giving &#39;comfort to Saddam Hussein.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Howard&#39;s arrogant attitude to the Iraqi situation has earned him an unprecedented no-confidence vote in the Australian Senate - the first time in the 102 years of its history that a serving PM has been so censured.</p>
<p>&quot;This man has committed his country to a war that our Government - to its credit, so far - has said is unjustified,&quot; said Green Co-leader Rod Donald. &quot;When the White House unleashes its war machine on Iraq, Australian forces - to their shame - will be active participants in the onslaught.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an obscenity that Helen Clark and her senior ministers would meet with Howard just days before the &#39;coalition of the willing&#39; could launch the first of its thousand missiles on Baghdad.</p>

<p>&quot;The New Zealand government has consistently refused to use its vaunted &#39;friendship&#39; with America to lobby Bush against this war. Now, it has the opportunity to finally make a clear statement for peace, by telling America&#39;s South Pacific proxy that he is not welcome in this country.</p>
<p>&quot;We would welcome a normalisation of relations when Howard commits to a peaceful resolution of the Iraq crisis.&quot;</p>
<p>Rod Donald, who will be participating in the peace rally at the US base at Christchurch International Airport at 2pm today.</p>
