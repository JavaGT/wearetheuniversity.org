<p>You Do The Talking, Winston, We&#39;ll Do The Thinking</p>
<p>There is only one line in New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters&#39; justified rant against political correctness and Treaty references which needs correction, ACT Justice and Treaty Spokesman Stephen Franks said today.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT is delighted that Mr Peters is turning his rhetoric to this topic again, in his excellent address to Grey Power Whitianga,&quot; Mr Franks said.</p>
<p>&quot;The line that&#39;s false, however, reads `only NZ First has consistently campaigned to rid us of this pestilence [the Treaty industry]&#39;. In fact, Mr Peters was part of the Government that scoffed at Derek Quigley&#39;s 1997 bill to deadline Treaty claims.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT was reviled as racist by every party - including NZ First - for being the first to campaign for one law for all New Zealanders. But we&#39;re not complaining that NZ First and National have both had second thoughts - it is long overdue. The media might prefer to report Mr Peters with our policies. That too is a form of political correctness - Mr Peters is Maori, and that has worked in his favour. Now it&#39;s working in favour of ordinary New Zealanders, who can hear the commonsense they&#39;ve been asking for.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ll keep doing the thinking Mr Peters, while you&#39;ll get the rhetoric reported.</p>
<p>&quot;The NZ First speech correctly targets the fatuous principles, but Mr Peters should be asked some hard questions: for example, does he reject the partnership? Will he stand for the same law applying across all land? Will he end race quotas in universities?</p>

<p>&quot;And, most importantly, what will he do with the Treaty itself, once the imaginary principles have been exposed as spurious - will he respect property rights?</p>
<p>&quot;ACT says the actual Treaty can be of huge value to all New Zealanders. The Government should respect the property rights guaranteed by Article Two, and the same rule of law for all New Zealanders promised in Article Three.</p>
<p>&quot;The true Treaty is no threat to New Zealand - but it is a threat to populists of the Left and the far Right, who would trash property rights of any minority if it would get them a vote,&quot; Mr Franks said.</p>
