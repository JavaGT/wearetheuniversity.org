<p>Prison Or Brothel? Asks Nz First Mp</p>
<p>New Zealand First corrections spokesperson Ron Mark says Paparua prison near Christchurch appears to be run more like a disorganised brothel than a penal institution.</p>
<p>This follows the case of a female prison officer who became pregnant to a convicted rapist who was serving time in Paparua for offences including drugging young girls for sex.</p>
<p>“This latest case involving a Canterbury prison is the latest in a series of scandals and it reinforces the need for an urgent inquiry into the management of prisons in the area.</p>
<p>“It also raises the issue of whether women should be employed as prison officers in prisons where dangerous sex offenders are serving time.”</p>
<p>Mr Mark said he was also interested to know why the prisoner David James Shepherd was later transferred to a North Island prison and whether it was so he could be near the woman and her son.</p>
<p>“Somebody has got some explaining to do,” said Mr Mark.  </p>
