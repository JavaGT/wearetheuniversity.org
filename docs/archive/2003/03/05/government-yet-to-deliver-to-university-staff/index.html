<p><img src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE"><br>Government claims to have increased funding to public tertiary institutions by 9.8% in the past three years paints a misleading picture says the Association of University Staff (AUS).</p>
<p>Responding to statements made to students during orientation week by the Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education), Hon, Steve Maharey, that the Government has “delivered for students”, AUS National President, Dr Bill Rosenberg says it is time the Government “delivered” to staff.</p>
<p>“The increases in funding to which Mr Maharey refers were offset by the cost of a student fees freeze. The universities have been no better, and in some cases worse, off,” said Dr Rosenberg. “Government funding per student remains significantly less in dollar terms than a decade ago and the burden of that underfunding has fallen on staff through redundancies and salary erosion.</p>
<p>&quot;While university staff welcome an end to rising student fees, the government must urgently address the funding problems in universities&quot;, said Dr Rosenberg.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the legacy of a decade of diminishing funding per student the fee freeze has exacerbated the problems of internationally inadequate salaries and constantly squeezed funding for research and new initiatives.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Rosenberg said that it was high time that the government, universities and unions sat down together to work out a reasonable framework for funding the institutions. It is particularly urgent and appropriate given that budget decisions are now being made and the government is entering into triennial funding for the tertiary sector.</p>
