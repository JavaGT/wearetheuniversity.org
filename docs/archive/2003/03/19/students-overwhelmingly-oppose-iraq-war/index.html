<p>Victoria University Students Overwhelmingly oppose Iraq War</p>
<p>Students at Victoria University overwhelming voted against any war on the people of Iraq in a landslide victory. VUWSA, the Victoria University of Wellington Students Association organised an IGM (Initial General Meeting) which passed the following 3 motions:</p>
<p>1. That VUWSA oppose any military action against the people of Iraq 2. That VUWSA call on the New Zealand government to actively oppose the war, and withdraw the frigate Te Mana from the Gulf. 3. That VUWSA supports Peace Action Wellington in campaigning against the war Mr Nick Kelly, the Campaigns Officer for VUWSA commented that “he was heartened at the opposition shown by the students against the war. This sends a strong signal to the government that they should not support this war of terror.”</p>
<p>The President of VUWSA Catherine Belfield-Haines stated that she was “pleased with the turnout and the valuable debate that took place at the meeting. This shows the role of a university, to be a critic and consequence of society.” All three motions carried overwhelmingly, with only a handful of students voting against the motion.</p>
<p>VUWSA will be collaborating with Peace Action Wellington and other anti-war lobby groups to oppose the war on Iraq and calls on other Student Associations and lobby groups to do the same.  </p>
