<p>Analysts Could Bolster Council</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Rural Affairs Spokesman Gerry Eckhoff today recommended that Fonterra&#39;s shareholders&#39; council consider inviting independent analysts to join the council.</p>
<p>&quot;Fonterra itself is thought to have benefited from the presence of independent directors, as do all boards who value differing perspectives and expertise brought to the boardroom,&quot; Mr Eckhoff said.</p>
<p>&quot;In reality, the shareholders&#39; council is no different. It has a wealth of dairy farming knowledge that could well benefit from independent financial or marketing expertise.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s trading world is so complex and competitive. The very best talents must be acquired by the dairy industry, as so much of New Zealand&#39;s prosperity relies upon this industry performing at the highest level.</p>
<p>&quot;It is also imperative that the shareholder council is not seen as a stepping stone to full board membership - in the vein of the old electoral college of the meat and wool board</p>
<p>&quot;Two or three highly skilled independent directors would help the shareholders&#39; council to hold the Fonterra board more accountable and demand performance,&quot; Mr Eckhoff said.</p>
