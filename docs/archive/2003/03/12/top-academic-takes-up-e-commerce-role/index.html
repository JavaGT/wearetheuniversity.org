<p><strong>Wednesday, 12 March 2003, 9:51 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Victoria University has appointed Dr Bob Klepper as the Jade Professor of Electronic Commerce in the School of Information Management.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Victoria, Professor Klepper was a Professor of Computer Management and Information Systems in the School of Business at the Southern Illinois University.</p>
<p>Professor Sid Huff, Head of the School of Information Management, said Professor Klepper&#39;s appointment was a sign of ongoing growth for e-commerce at Victoria.</p>
<p>&quot;Professor Klepper, along with new Associate Professors Hans Lehmann and Stuart Barnes, will greatly boost our e-commerce expertise. The growth in student demand for our information systems and e-commerce courses has been very strong of late.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Klepper&#39;s research interests centre on the acquisition and implementation of new technology in organisations and the role that trust and reputation play in fostering business-to-consumer electronic commerce. His electronic business research areas also include overcoming barriers to e-business in developing countries and the role of distance in a networked world.</p>
<p>Professor Klepper, the author of Outsourcing Information Technology, Systems and Services, has acted as a consultant for a number of corporations and public bodies throughout the world. These have included seminars on outsourcing for IBM, an analysis of online data research capabilities for a large public library and advising a Romanian manufacturing firm on information systems planning and the implementation of a quality assurance programme.</p>
<p>He has a PhD in economics from the University of Chicago and a Master degree in management information systems from Washington University in St Louis.</p>
<p>Professor Klepper replaces inaugural Jade Professor of e-commerce Brian Corbett.</p>
