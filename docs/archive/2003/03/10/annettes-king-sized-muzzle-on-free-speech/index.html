<p>Annette&#39;s King-sized muzzle on free speech</p>
<p>Green MP Sue Kedgley said she was dismayed by health minister Annette King&#39;s attack on Canterbury District Health Board member Erin Baker for expressing her views on health funding.</p>
<p>&quot;This is yet another example of the health minister trying to gag and muzzle democratically elected DHB members and prevent them from speaking out on health matters,&quot; said the Greens Health spokesperson.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of trying to stifle dissent by lashing out at any DHB member who criticises or holds a different view to her own, Ms King should be encouraging honest and open debate within the health sector.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley said she supported Ms Baker&#39;s call for DHB members around the country to speak out on health issues and not accept gagging by DHBs.</p>
<p>&quot;What on earth is the point in going to all the expense and trouble of democratically electing DHB members if they are not able to openly express their views and be accountable to the people who elected them,&quot; she said.  </p>
