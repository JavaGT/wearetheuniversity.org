<p><strong>Monday, 10 March 2003, 12:17 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Government Makes Dpb A Career Choice</p>
<p>New Zealand First says the Social Security Amendment Act, which comes into affect today, is an invitation to young women to make a career out of being on the domestic purpose benefit.</p>
<p>Family affairs spokesperson Barbara Stewart says the Government’s abolition of the work test for those on the DPB encourages people not to work even if their circumstances allow it.</p>
<p>“While the Government’s objective may be to take pressure off genuine cases of people who need to stay at home once their children start school, the means of achieving it are crazy,” said Mrs Stewart.</p>
<p>“The Social Security Amendment Act is absurd because it now guarantees wages for 18 years without the recipients ever having to contribute, or attempt to contribute to their own existence.</p>
<p>“This country is becoming even more of a benefit state with hundreds of thousands of people being paid to do nothing and the latest move sends the wrong message to young people looking at career options.</p>
<p>“We want to encourage our children to work and support themselves, not show them how easy it is to get paid to have children.</p>
<p>”This cannot be a career choice, but rather a last resort for people in genuine need.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First believes we have to work towards making beneficiaries independent of the state. The removal of the work test will not achieve this,” said Mrs Stewart.  </p>
