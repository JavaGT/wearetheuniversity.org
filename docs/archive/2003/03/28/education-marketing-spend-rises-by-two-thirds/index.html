<p>Education marketing spend rises by two thirds</p>
<p>Tertiary spending on advertising through AC Nielsen has increased by nearly two thirds since 1999, according to figures released today by the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>&quot;Public universities, polytechnics and colleges of education spent nearly $75 million competing with each other in advertising over the last four years,&quot; said NZUSA Co-President Roz Connelly. &quot;This represents a massive waste in public money and in student fees.&quot;</p>
<p>The increase in spending took place during a period that government hailed as the end of competition in public tertiary education.</p>
<p>&quot;The amount wasted by public tertiary institutions rose significantly each year of the Labour government,&quot; said NZUSA Co-President Fleur Fitzsimons. &quot;Spending on TV, radio, print and cinema advertising went from just under $13 million in 1999 to over $23 million in 2002.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The AC Nielsen figures are only the tip of the iceberg,&quot; said Fitzsimons. &quot;When you add in staff at institutions, direct mail, and the plethora of promotions and competitions run by institutions, the marketing bill will be well in excess of $100 million.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We call on the Government and the newly formed Tertiary Education Commission to start reining in this ridiculous spending spree,&quot; said Fitzsimons. &quot;If they don&#39;t, this spending will continue to rise each year - and it&#39;s students and taxpayers who are paying the price.&quot;</p>
