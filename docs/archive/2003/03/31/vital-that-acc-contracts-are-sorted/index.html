<p>Vital that ACC contracts are sorted</p>
<p>Continued quality care for patients is vital if ACC follows its threat to pull its multi-million dollar elective surgery contract from the country&#39;s largest private hospital Mercy-Ascot Hospital, says National ACC Spokesperson Dr Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;The public has a right to expect value for the money spent on private or public contracts and ACC always has the option to change who it contracts with.</p>
<p>&quot;While Mercy-Ascot has a very good reputation, if it is not performing up to the standard ACC sets regarding its contract then ACC can go elsewhere - there are seven hospitals in Auckland it can use.</p>
<p>&quot;The best way to do this is by maintaining choice across the private and public services available.</p>
<p>&quot;It is no secret that the public health system is severely stretched with thousands of people unable to get operations. It is a year since the case of a young boy with a fractured collarbone who waited more than a week for surgery at public hospital. His operation was performed immediately when he was transferred to a private hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark caused great offence by publicly denigrating Mercy-Ascot when it opened, again exposing her preference for a monopolistic, and therefore inefficient, public health system.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike the Prime Minister there is no doubt in my mind that having a choice of high quality public and private hospitals, where public money can be spent, gives patients the best and most cost effective care,&quot; Dr Hutchison said.</p>
