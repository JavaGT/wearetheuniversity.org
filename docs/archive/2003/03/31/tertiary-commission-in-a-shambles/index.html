<p><strong>Monday, 31 March 2003, 9:18 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Tertiary Commission in a shambles</p>
<p>The further delay of a funding framework for universities and hundreds of other tertiary institutions after the Government spent nearly $1m on staffing and consultants to design the framework, shows the complete incompetence of the Tertiary Education Commission and its architect Steve Maharey.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a flagship framework which has taken years, four major reports and employed 256 staff to get it in place.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we hear that this famous framework that was meant to be the answer to all the problems in tertiary education cost another $225,000 (+GST), on consultants, and yet it is still being delayed.</p>
<p>Questions from Mr Power to the Minister reveal that the Tertiary Education Commission this year bought in consultants, Burleigh Evatt, to redo the work which the Commission had spent $760,000 designing in 2002.</p>
<p>&quot;That 1000 universities, colleges of education, polytechnics and private institutions won&#39;t have the new funding framework for another two years, despite all the work that&#39;s gone into this is just beyond me,&quot; Mr Power said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is something seriously wrong when the large numbers of staff at the commission couldn&#39;t get the job done, and high-paid consultants had to be bought in to do the work.</p>
<p>&quot;For a Government that was going to clamp down on a supposed &#39;culture of extravagance&#39; this kind of spending the result is ridiculous. The Minister must explain exactly why this much promoted framework is costing so much and taking so long to get in place,&quot; Mr Power said.</p>
