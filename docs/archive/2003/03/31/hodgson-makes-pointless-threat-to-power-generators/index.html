<p><strong>Monday, 31 March 2003, 11:14 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hodgson makes pointless threat to power generators</p>
<p>The National Party&#39;s appalled by an unprovoked attack on power generators by Energy Minister Pete Hodgson.</p>
<p>&quot;In today&#39;s Otago Daily Times Mr Hodgson says of electricity generators that &#39;the Government would bring them to their knees&#39; if they fail to get the country through winter.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s an appalling abuse of power, and what&#39;s worse is it serves no purpose because the Government owns 80% of the country&#39;s generation capacity,&quot; says National Party Energy spokesman Gerry Brownlee.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister challenges the market to &#39;make it work or the political process will take it off you&#39; - after four years in the job that&#39;s the best he can come up with.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a Labour Government that&#39;s again showing its business naivety, clearly Helen Clark was right to remove Pete Hodgson from the management of the looming electricity crisis,&quot; says Mr Brownlee.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s that kind of thinking out loud that has seen Contact Energy shares fall from $4.45 on Monday March 24, to $4.21 this morning.</p>
<p>&quot;That is a 5.4% drop in price in the five trading days since Helen Clark threatened &#39;significant change&#39; in the sector.</p>
<p>&quot;Those are the so called &#39;mum and dad&#39; shareholders who bought Contact shares never imagining the Government would deliberately erode the value of their investment with off the cuff comments.</p>
<p>&quot;It feels like a case of déjà vu - remember the Government&#39;s botched handling of the Air New Zealand deal?&quot; Mr Brownlee asks.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s been left naval gazing as it looks to solve the looming crisis, offering up backward thinking ideas that include price fixing and more state control.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government&#39;s even advocating the appointment of a centralised buyer who would purchase more power than the country needs to get through a dry year.</p>
<p>&quot;But it&#39;s clearly missing the point, when there&#39;s no power to buy.</p>
<p>&quot;Householders and businesses want real answers - not misdirected threats and half baked solutions,&quot; Mr Brownlee says  </p>
