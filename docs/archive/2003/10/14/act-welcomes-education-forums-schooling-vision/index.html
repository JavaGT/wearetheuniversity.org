<p>ACT Welcomes Education Forum&#39;s Schooling Vision</p>
<p>Tuesday 14 Oct 2003 Deborah Coddington Press Releases -- Education</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today welcomed the launch of the Education Forum&#39;s `A New Deal: Making Education Work for all New Zealanders&#39;, describing it as another voice in the growing chorus calling for a reform of New Zealand&#39;s failing education system.</p>
<p>&quot;I am proud to co-host the launch of this vision piece, with education spokespeople from National, United Future and New Zealand First,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;I share with the Education Forum the goal to make education the core issue of the next general election. `A New Deal&#39; is a comprehensive framework that would lift our education standards - it is a road map for the way ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;This document shares common threads with my book, `Let Parents Choose&#39; - it advocates giving parents greater freedom to determine what school would best suit their children&#39;s needs, and that the State should support that choice with funding that follows the child.</p>
<p>&quot;Another central theme is that of empowering students, parents, teachers and principals with meaningful information to determine how well the education system is serving our children.</p>
<p>&quot;Teachers will welcome the message that they should be entrusted with determining the best way of organising themselves. Only union leaders need fear the idea that we must build a stronger culture of professionalism in the teaching sector.</p>

<p>&quot;The recent launches of my book, National&#39;s education policy discussion document, the school funding paper from the Independent Schools of New Zealand, Maxim&#39;s book `Vying For Our Children&#39;, and now `A New Deal&#39;, show that there are many voices calling for a comprehensive overhaul of our education system.</p>
<p>&quot;The message is too strong, and the ideas too powerful, to be ignored. The time for the school choice concept has truly come,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
