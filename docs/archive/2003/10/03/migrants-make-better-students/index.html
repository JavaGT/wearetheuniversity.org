<p>Migrants ‘Make Better Students’</p>
<p>“An international report’s findings that immigrant students are more confident and motivated than their New Zealand-born counterparts will no doubt be welcomed by Labour and other advocates of New Zealand’s open door policy,” said New Zealand First Deputy Leader, Peter Brown.</p>
<p>“The conclusion they will inevitably reach is that it is worthwhile importing more foreign students, not recognizing it is to the disadvantage of New Zealanders. The theory being subscribed to is that a more highly skilled and subservient work force and economic salvation will surely follow.</p>
<p>“The real lesson we need to take from such research is that we are failing our young people and leaving them in ignorance because our schools are being geared too much to the needs of fee-paying foreigners.</p>
<p>“The message that will emerge is that immigrants are good but Kiwis present problems. Perhaps that is why our Government appears unconcerned that New Zealand born citizens leave - it tknows it can replace them with migrants.</p>
<p>“All in all this report shows that we must do better for our young people in this country because we are failing them big time. That is the real lesson, not for the students but for this Government,” said Mr Brown.</p>
