<p>Government in trouble over tertiary policy</p>
<p>The Government has once again dismissed the plight of students with its defence of the student loans scheme in Parliament today, said Green MP Nandor Tanczos.</p>
<p>Answering questions in the House, tertiary education minister Steve Maharey announced a $2.6 billion decrease in forecasted student loan debt for 2020 - simultaneously with a student occupation of the Massey University Registry in Palmerston North. This followed similar action at Victoria University last week.</p>
<p>&quot;The student occupations highlight the level of anger and desperation at the Government&#39;s refusal to act on the major causes of the student loan crisis,&quot; said Nandor, the Green spokesperson for Tertiary Education.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister thinks that because the protest involves 20 students from a roll of 9,400 it is an endorsement of Government policy.</p>
<p>&quot;That response belittles the depth of feeling on campuses across the country.</p>
<p>&quot;The Green Party offers its support to students trying to point it out to the Minister.&quot;</p>
<p>Nandor said the Minister&#39;s claim that forecasted debt to 2020 has fallen by $2.6 billion from an estimated $17 billion forecasted last year was nothing to be proud about.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter which way the Minister tries to spin it, student loan debt is spiralling up while the hopes of the current generation of students plummet,&quot; said Nandor.</p>
<p>&quot;Student debt has doubled to $6 billion, and will be near $7 billion by the time students return next year.</p>
<p>&quot;I urge Mr Maharey to have a serious think about the effects of his Government&#39;s lack of real action on student loans and give tertiary students a good reason to come back to school next year.&quot;  </p>
