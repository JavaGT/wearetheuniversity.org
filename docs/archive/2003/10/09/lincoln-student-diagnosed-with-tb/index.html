<p>Lincoln Student Diagnosed With TB</p>
<p>A Lincoln University student is in hospital after being diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB).</p>
<p>TB is treatable and curable in most cases.</p>
<p>Primary contacts of the student (people who have had recent one-to-one interactions) are being contacted by Community and Public Health staff to establish whether they need to be tested.</p>
<p>Students and staff are being reassured that they are only at risk of having contracted the disease if they have had one-to-one interactions with people who have TB. Those people have been identified by Community and Public Health, who will be in touch with them.</p>
<p>It is business as usual at the University.  </p>
