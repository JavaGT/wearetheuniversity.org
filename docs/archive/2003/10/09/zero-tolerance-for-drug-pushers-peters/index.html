<p>Zero Tolerance For Drug Pushers - Peters</p>
<p>“The misleading rantings of pro cannabis MP Nandor Tanczos were today relegated to the rubbish bin for all time,” said New Zealand First Leader, Rt Hon Winston Peters MP.</p>
<p>Mr Peters was quoting reports by senior Australian and New Zealand Police who stated categorically that the linkage between cannabis use, heroin, speed and memphetamines was irrefutable.</p>
<p>Detective Sergent Darryl Brazier of the New Zealand Police and Superintendent Fred Gere of the Western Australian Police, a world renowned authority on organised crime and drug usage, stated in response to questions today following a presentation at the Annual Conference of the New Zealand Police Association, that cannabis use was an integral component of modern drug addictions, particularly memphetamines.</p>
<p>During the presentation by these experienced and recognised authorities on drug usage and organised crime, it was stated that cannabis is consistent with the use of memphetamines such as “P” which gives an abnormally high “high”. It is common for users to turn to lesser drugs such as cannabis to help them obtain normality and some equilibrium after using P, it was said.</p>
<p>Mr Gere went further and stated that of the 150 drug related deaths each year investigated by the Western Australia Police all produced evidence of cannabis use following autopsies.</p>
<p>“The irresponsible utterings of opportunist politicians, using their position to promote drugs, is abhorrent and parties such as the Greens should bring this renegade MP to heel before he creates more drug users in New Zealand through his pro-drug message to schools and universities,” said Mr Peters.</p>

<p>Mr Peters also commented on the progressive legislation introduced in Western Australia that is now becoming widely reflected in other Australian states and the Federal Government. This has shifted the onus of proof from police to organised crime drug bosses to prove the source of their vast wealth. This in turn has enabled Australian law enforcement agencies to seize millions obtained through criminal activity in drug dealing in particular and is proving the most effective deterrent in the war of drug pushing.</p>
<p>“If we are to seriously deal with the increasing drug problem, we have to look at ensuring police have the authority and tools to do the job, and the courts the power to give effect to those efforts,” concluded Mr Peters.</p>
