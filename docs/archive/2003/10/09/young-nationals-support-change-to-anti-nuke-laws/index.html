<p><strong>Thursday, 9 October 2003, 9:53 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Young_Nationals">New Zealand Young Nationals</a></strong></p>
<p>Young Nationals support change to anti-nuke legislation</p>
<p>&quot;An affront to democracy and free speech&quot; was how New Zealand Young Nationals Chairman Jamie Simpson described protesters who prevented US Ambassador Swindells from delivering his important speech yesterday at Victoria University.</p>
<p>&quot;The New Zealand Young Nationals are impressed with the clarity of Ambassador Swindells&#39; analysis of the US/New Zealand relationship and unequivocally back the call for New Zealand to revisit the nuclear issue.</p>
<p>&quot;It is time for New Zealand to address the nuclear issue and look to the future.</p>
<p>&quot;It is in New Zealand&#39;s interests to create a mutually beneficial trade and defence relationship with our &#39;very good friends&#39; and former ally, the United States. It is nonsensical that the barrier between our countries is a hysterical confusion between nuclear power and nuclear weapons. The United States are asking the question, but Prime Minister Helen Clark is not listening.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a continuing slap in the face to an old ally and friend,&quot; Jamie Simpson says.</p>
<p>&quot;The New Zealand Young Nationals continue to support the amendment of the nuclear free legislation that would allow our allies&#39; nuclear powered vessels to visit and will be prevailing this point upon the current National Party review on the issue,&quot; Jamie Simpson concluded.</p>
