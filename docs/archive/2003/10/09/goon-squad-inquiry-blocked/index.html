<p>Goon Squad Inquiry Blocked</p>
<p>The decision by the law and order select committee to not proceed with an inquiry into the operation of the Correction Department’s Emergency Response unit (ERU) in Canterbury is an outright disgrace.</p>
<p>“Labour has used its numbers on the committee to block the inquiry. The Government has done nothing but show itself to be gutless and afraid of what the outcome may be,” said New Zealand First law and order spokesperson, Ron Mark.</p>
<p>“Their actions will do nothing to increase public confidence in a Corrections Department whose credibility has been seriously tarnished over its handling of the Goon Squad.</p>
<p>“It is particularly laughable that socialist MP’s such as Anne Hartley, Georgina Beyers, Mahara Okeroa and Martin Gallagher, regularly complained about how poorly the Corrections Department was run under National, about the treatment of Maori inmates and about the bullying tactics of officers, when given an opportunity to do something about it just roll over and do nothing.</p>
<p>“Their promises when it comes to justice and accountability, like all of Labour’s promises, are worthless.</p>
<p>“This issue will not go away as more inmates seek compensation, and more prison officers come forward in the employment court seeking financial redress for the illegal things they were forced to do while working for the Corrections Department.</p>
<p>“This Government cover-up resolves nothing, it only confirms that Labour cannot be trusted,” said Mr Mark.  </p>
