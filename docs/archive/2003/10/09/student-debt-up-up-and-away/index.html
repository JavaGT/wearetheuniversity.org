<p><strong>Thursday, 9 October 2003, 8:49 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Student debt up, up and away</p>
<p>The National Party says it&#39;s clear Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey has lost control of soaring student debt.</p>
<p>Commenting on the release today of the Student Loan Scheme annual report, National&#39;s Tertiary Education spokesman Simon Power says it&#39;s not surprising that total student debt has rocketed up $620 million in the last financial year.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey is quick to try and claim credit for a fall in long term projected debt levels, but the simple fact is student debt has grown every year since Labour came in.</p>
<p>&quot;The average balance of student loans is now $13,680 - up 8.2 per cent on last year. The number of borrowers is also on the rise - totalling more than 150 thousand last year, compared with 115-thousand in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;And today&#39;s figures show they borrowed an average of $6204 in 2002, up from an average of $4917 in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;When will the Government finally see that its interest-free policy is just causing more and more students to rack up hefty debt?&quot; asks Mr Power.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey is clearly bereft of answers - even producing the Student Support Review a year late didn&#39;t give him enough space to come up with a solution to the student debt crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead, he&#39;s tried to grasp any straw he can from the report and ignore a staggering debt of $5.3 billion,&quot; says Mr Power.  </p>
