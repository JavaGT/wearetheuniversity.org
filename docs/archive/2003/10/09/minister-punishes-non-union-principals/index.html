<p><strong>Thursday, 9 October 2003, 2:33 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Dr Nick Smith National Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>9 October 2003</p>
<p>Minister punishes non-union principals</p>
<p>School principals who are not members of the teachers union are to be punished by several thousand dollars in the latest pay settlement, says National&#39;s Education Spokesperson Nick Smith, after being approached by angry principals.</p>
<p>&quot;It speaks volumes about the Government&#39;s approach to education that union membership is more important than performance in determining principals&#39; salaries. It is outrageous that those principals who are union members are to get several thousand dollars more than principals who are not,&quot; Dr Smith said.</p>
<p>The Education Circular 2003/17 of 3rd October 2003 on the principals&#39; pay settlement states that union members will receive back pay to the 9th July 2003 whereas other principals will not be eligible for the increase until after 9 October 2003.</p>
<p>&quot;A principal who enquired of the Ministry as to why there was this discrimination against non-union principals, was told it was a dictate from the Education Minister,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This decision is not only cynical politics but it undermines sound management of our schools.</p>
<p>&quot;Principals have a duty to act as an advocate for students and the community in cases like last year&#39;s teachers&#39; strike, but their role will be compromised by this re-unionising of principals into the teachers&#39; union. The Minister is putting Labour funds and union backing ahead of the needs of students and schools,&quot; Dr Smith said.</p>
