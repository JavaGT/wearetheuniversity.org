<p>A Wananga Is Not A University</p>
<p>Progressive Coalition MP Matt Robson has compounded the confusion surrounding the nature and definition of tertiary education institutions in New Zealand, according to the NZ Vice-Chancellors’ Committee.</p>
<p>The NZVCC, which represents the country’s eight universities, today rebutted Mr Robson’s assertion that Te Wananga o Aotearoa was in fact the University of New Zealand.</p>
<p>“There are five types of tertiary education institution recognized in the Education Act – universities, polytechnics, colleges of education, wananga and specialist colleges. A wananga is just that, not a university, polytechnic, college of education or specialist college,” NZVCC Executive Director Lindsay Taiaroa says.</p>
<p>“Te Wananga o Aotearoa is certainly not to be confused with the University of New Zealand which was dissolved in 1961. Te Wananga o Aotearoa concentrates its teaching efforts at lower levels of the National Qualifications Framework whereas universities, as everybody except Matt Robson knows, teach mainly at degree level.”</p>
<p>The issue stems from media reports that Te Wananga o Aotearoa is working with the Cuban government to offer a Cuban-developed distance learning literacy programme in this country. That development has drawn criticism from ACT MP Rodney Hide which Mr Robson responded to by defending Te Wananga o Aotearoa’s move, describing its choice of a UNICEF awarding winning programme to combat illiteracy among Maori as “sensible”. It was in this context that Mr Robson erroneously referred to Te Wananaga o Aotearoa as the University of New Zealand.  </p>
