<p>Being Seen In The Woods And The Trees</p>
<p>Being seen can be the difference between life and death for forestry workers.</p>
<p>Waikato University psychology senior lecturer Robert Isler, a specialist in high visibility safety vests, is playing his part under a new contract with the Forest Owners Association.</p>
<p>The contract makes him available to vet any new type of safety vest for the forestry industry to ensure it complies with visibility standards he helped develop.</p>
<p>Waikato researchers have been involved in looking at safety vests for some time. “Yellow vests are generally best in darker conditions, while orange is best in daylight,” he says.</p>
<p>Recently Dr Isler was approached by a manufacturer of safety vests, suggesting that formal guidelines and standards for the forestry industry needed developing.</p>
<p>The Forest Owners Association agreed to this idea and the Dr Isler’s standards were formally adopted by the association about six months ago.</p>
<p>Now the association has entered into the contract for vest testing.</p>
<p>“It’s good to see the research done at Waikato having a very practical application for worker safety,” says Dr Isler.  </p>
