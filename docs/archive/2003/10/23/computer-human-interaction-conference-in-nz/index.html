<p>Computer-Human Interaction conference comes to New Zealand</p>
<p>For the first time in the eight-year history of the event, the Asia Pacific Computer-Human Interaction (APCHI) 2004 conference will be held in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Hosted by the Waikato University Computer Science department, APCHI 2004 will run from 29 June to 2 July 2004 in Rotorua and is the sixth biennial gathering of Computer-Human Interaction (CHI) experts in the region.</p>
<p>CHI research focuses on the human side of computing. Researchers and practitioners look at ways to reduce frustration and confusion often associated with technology by making sure interactive systems - ranging from desktop computers to mobile phones and DVD players - support user needs.</p>
<p>Conference Chair and senior computer science lecturer at Waikato University, Dr Matt Jones, says previous APCHI conferences had been held in Singapore, Sydney, Beijing and Japan.</p>
<p>&quot;Major international companies like Nokia, Microsoft and Intel take usability very seriously and New Zealand businesses are also starting to become quite active in this field,” says Dr Jones.</p>
<p>“The APCHI conference will be an excellent opportunity for the world to see Kiwi innovation as well as enabling local organisations to get a wider perspective on the opportunities”.</p>

<p>The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research group at Waikato University will be taking the opportunity to introduce overseas visitors to a bit of Kiwi creativity, with current projects including photo and map browsing tools for handheld computers and mobile phones.</p>
<p>APCHI is considered to be the key usability and interaction design conference in the Asia Pacific region. The four-day conference will focus on emerging new technologies such as handheld devices and wearable computers, as well as looking at designing-in ease of use.</p>
<p>Dr Jones also expects there to be discussion of how human creativity and emotion can be incorporated into computer system development.</p>
<p>Keynote speakers already confirmed include Professor Don Norman and Dr Susan Dray, both from the USA (see attached biographies). Dr Jones expects to confirm more speakers over the coming months.</p>
