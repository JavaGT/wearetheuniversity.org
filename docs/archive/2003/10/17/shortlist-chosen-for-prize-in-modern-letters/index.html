<p>Shortlist chosen for Prize in Modern Letters</p>
<p>Thirty-nine entries for the prestigious $60,000 Prize in Modern Letters have been short listed to four authors – two novelists and two poets.</p>
<p>The short list is:</p>
<p>William Brandt Alpha Male (1999), The Book of the Film of the Story of my Life (2002). Victoria University Press.<br>Kate Camp Unfamiliar Legends of the Stars (1998), Realia (2001). Victoria University Press.<br>Glenn Colquhoun The Art of Walking Upright (1999), Playing God (2002).<br>Steele Roberts Ltd.<br>Geoff Cush Son of France (2002). Random House.  </p>
<p>Professor Bill Manhire, Director of the International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML) at Victoria University, says the finalists’ work now goes forward to be read by a panel of American jurors, convened by Eric Olsen, Director of the IIML at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“It’s a great relief to me that the final decision is out of our hands,” said Professor Manhire. “The judges are going to have a very hard time reaching a decision. The shortlisting group managed to get the 39 entries down to nine or ten, but then spent several more weeks before settling on the final four.”</p>
<p>He said that he would not dare predict the eventual winner.</p>
<p>“The only thing I feel quite sure of is that contemporary New Zealand writing is in very good health.”</p>
<p>The winner will be announced at an award ceremony in Wellington during Writers and Readers Week at the International Arts Festival in March 2004.</p>
<p>Glenn Schaeffer, the literary activist who founded the International Institute of Modern Letters at Victoria, funds the Prize in Modern Letters.</p>
<p>The inaugural Prize was awarded to novelist Catherine Chidgey in March 2002. Her third novel, The Transformation, will be published later this year by Victoria University Press.</p>
<p>The Institute also plays a key role in another major literary appointment - the Te Mata Estate New Zealand Poet Laureate – and is responsible for co-ordinating the biennial selection and management of the appointment. In February 2003, Brian Turner was named Poet Laureate for a period of two years.</p>
