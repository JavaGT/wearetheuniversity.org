<p>Special Education Negotiators Settle Pay Deal</p>
<p>A settlement has been reached in the industrial dispute involving more than 600 special education field staff.</p>
<p>The settlement follows two weeks of industrial action in which the field staff imposed a number of work bans.</p>
<p>They took the action after eight months of negotiations failed to deliver an acceptable pay offer.</p>
<p>Negotiations resumed this week and agreement was reached on a settlement package.</p>
<p>The settlement package, which is subject to ratification by the field staff, includes<br>- Payment of a $500 lump sum.<br>- Two pay rises of 2.5%, the first taking affect next month, the second in November next year.<br>- A 2.5% increase in the higher duties allowance<br>- Improvements at the top end of their salary bands for some of the field staff.<br>- Agreement by the Ministry to discuss, within the term of the collective agreement, the development of a unified pay scale for all the field staff.<br>- Agreement by the Ministry to discuss, within term of the agreement, pay comparisons with the education sector.<br>- Agreement to address other issue such as professional development and workloads.</p>
<p>The industrial action has been suspended and field staff will be attending meetings throughout the country to vote on the package.</p>
<p>“The negotiating team is recommending they accept the settlement package as it represents a substantial improvement on the Ministry’s earlier position and addresses most of the significant issues in the claim,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Bruce Adin.</p>
