<p>AUT Students Disappointed By Fee Increase</p>
<p>Students at AUT today joined the unfortunate and growing number of students facing a fee increase next year, after the AUT council voted to raise fees by 4.96 or $171.</p>
<p>“This is another financial burden that students will have to shoulder,” said Elliot Roberts, President of Auckland Student Movement at AUT. “both government and AUT need to be more accountable to students when they make decisions that will see us pay more fees, borrow bigger student loans and spend more years repaying debt.”</p>
<p>Were concerned that students are now back in the cycle of annual fee rises, as happened in the 90s, said Roberts. “the system of fee maxima has failed as a way of controlling fee increases, when most institutions have gone very close to the maximum of 5 percent.”</p>
<p>The actions of the government and the institution combined, have ensured students face increasing pressure and financial burden whilst studying.</p>
<p>“ We will be going back to Steve Maharey to make good on his promise to make tertiary education affordable. It just got a lot less affordable for AUT student,” said Roberts.  </p>
