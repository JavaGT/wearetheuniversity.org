<p><strong>Thursday, 30 October 2003, 9:25 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Students Release Alternative Student Support Review: The Real Story</p>
<p>In two months, students have produced what government has been unable to produce after nearly two years - a fair analysis of student loans and allowances in New Zealand with concrete suggestions for improvements.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re releasing our Alternative Discussion Document on Student Support to provide balance to the government&#39;s one-sided review,&quot; said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association. &quot;We canvas the wide variety of concerns about the negative impact of the loan scheme and outline a plan for change.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The first thing that Government could do if they wanted to fix student support is immediately commit to a living allowance for all students,&quot; said Fitzsimons. &quot;This would reduce reliance on student loans and would especially cut down the size of bigger loans.&quot;</p>
<p>The student report contains new data from the Ministry of Social Development, which shows that over 40 percent of student loan borrowing over $10,000 per year is for living costs, despite this group of students including those enrolled in high fees courses such as medicine.</p>
<p>&quot;Government has asked students for feedback on their conservative Student Support Review. Our message is clear - a living allowance for all should be the number one priority for change.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They have already disappointed students and the community with a lacklustre discussion document,&quot; said Fitzsimons. &quot;Government now needs to look at both sides of the story and start dismantling their unfair loans scheme.&quot;</p>
<p>Submissions close for the government&#39;s Discussion Document on Student Support today. The NZUSA submission calls on the government to deliver meaningful change to address the $6 billion dollars of student debt that is crippling the country.</p>
<p>Copies of the document are available on the NZUSA Website or by contacting NZUSA</p>
