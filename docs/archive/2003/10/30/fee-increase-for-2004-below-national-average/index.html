<p>Lincoln’s fee increase for 2004 below national average</p>
<p>An average 3.4 percent increase in fees for 2004 has been approved by Lincoln University Council and a move by the University to subject-based fees means that costs will be equitably shared by students across the full spectrum of qualifications offered.</p>
<p>The old qualifications-based fee system hit students’ pockets with peaks and troughs in costs according to their choice of degree, diploma and certificate. Now everyone sitting the same subject will pay the same dollars.</p>
<p>The move to a subject-based fees system, endorsed at Lincoln University’s Council meeting of 21 October, required the subsequent approval of the Tertiary Education Commission and this has now been received verbally.</p>
<p>“Fees at Lincoln University, as at other institutions, have been frozen for the past three years under an agreement with the Government but the end of the freeze has given the University an opportunity to reassess its approach to fee setting which has resulted in the move to a subject-based model,” says Acting Vice-Chancellor Roger Field.</p>
<p>“The average of 3.4 percent obviously means that some individual subjects will be above and some below that figure.”</p>
<p>Lincoln’s increase is lower than the average of the increases announced so far by seven of the country’s eight universities.</p>
<p>“Our increase is comparable to what the others have announced,” says Professor Field. “In the past we have offered the second lowest fees in Commerce, the third lowest in Humanities and Social Science and we have been competitive in Science. We expect these relativities to stay the same.”</p>
<p>All of Lincoln’s new fees will be available on the University’s website from Wednesday 5 November.</p>
<p>“Within the system as a whole in New Zealand, Lincoln University continues to offer students excellent value for money,” says Professor Field.  </p>
