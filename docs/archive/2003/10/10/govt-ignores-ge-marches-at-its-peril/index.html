<p><strong>Friday, 10 October 2003, 12:01 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Govt ignores GE marches at its peril</p>
<p>The Government has to wake up and respect New Zealanders&#39; huge opposition to GE release, which will be expressed in GE free marches around the country tomorrow, the Green Co-leaders say.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government ignores the wishes of the majority of voters at its peril,&quot; Jeanette Fitzsimons and Rod Donald said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Thousands of New Zealanders will take their GE free message to the streets tomorrow. They will express their very real anger that the Government has ignored their calls for the moratorium on GE releases into the environment to be extended, and for GE to remain in the lab.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not too late for the Government to see sense. It could easily introduce new legislation extending the moratorium by five years,&quot; the Co-leaders said. The Green Party encourages all New Zealanders to get out on the streets tomorrow, to remind the Government that this issue won&#39;t go away.</p>
