<p><strong>Wednesday, 29 October 2003, 9:31 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University_Students_Association">Lincoln University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Lincoln students want something back from 3.4% fee increase.</p>
<p>Lincoln University voted a week ago at a Council meeting to increase domestic student fees for 2004 by an average of 3.4%.</p>
<p>&quot;I think students will be angry and disappointed that they will end up paying in some instances 100&#39;s of dollars more in fees next year without good reason.&quot; Said Andrew Kirton, Lincoln University Students&#39; Association President.</p>
<p>Mr. Kirton is calling on the university to now give something back to students, in the form of new facilities, new services or an increase in academic quality.</p>
<p>&quot;Otherwise the fee increase becomes yet another revenue generating exercise to impress Wellington at the expense of students.&quot; Kirton said.</p>
<p>Mr. Kirton warned the University not to be drawn into a &quot;zombie-like mentality&quot; of annual fee increases without reason.</p>
<p>&quot;Students can and will get angry very quickly if Lincoln continues to put revenue before their welfare and education.&quot; Kirton said.</p>
<p>&quot;The University has cited the need to meet revenue projections as the main driver behind the fee increase - cold comfort for the students actually sitting in the lecture theatres paying all this extra money just so the university management look good.&quot; Kirton said.  </p>
