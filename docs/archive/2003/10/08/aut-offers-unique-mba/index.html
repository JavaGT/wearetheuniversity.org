<p>AUT Offers Unique MBA</p>
<p>AUT has reached a new milestone and is for the first time offering an MBA. The point of difference with the AUT MBA is flexibility.</p>
<p>The new MBA programme begins in January 2004 and will be very flexible with six starting points throughout the year allowing students to fit the MBA in around their lifestyle and work commitments.</p>
<p>“AUT already has a very strong reputation as a university, especially with its popular Bachelor of Business programme that is geared towards getting students work ready. The MBA signifies a further commitment from AUT towards enhancing higher education for the country’s middle management,” says Des Graydon AUT Business Faculty Dean.</p>
<p>“We carefully looked at MBAs offered both in New Zealand and overseas before we decided on our format. One of the key issues raised was that the MBA was too demanding on students’ time.</p>
<p>“Our MBA is very flexible with six starting points, each consisting of an eight week block. This means students can complete the MBA in one year or take a break and recommence when personal and work commitments allow.”</p>
<p>The MBA is a positive move towards addressing recent criticism of New Zealand business schools as a whole for not providing world-class business education.</p>
<p>“Business educators have a responsibility to ensure that New Zealand’s business leaders are well equipped to succeed internationally and drive domestic growth through good management and entrepreneurial skills and we believe that we are doing this with this unique MBA,” Mr Graydon says.</p>

<p>“Without superior business education New Zealand will be unable to compete in the global market place and economic growth will be challenging.”</p>
<p>Recognising the pressures of work and family life AUT has taken a decisive step with this MBA to relieve stress. Lectures aren’t held over the weekend, allowing students to relax, play sport and enjoy family life. Also each daily lecture is held twice offering further flexibility around work and family.</p>
<p>The MBA will provide practical solutions to real industry problems enabling students to produce results that have relevance to their industry and work environment.</p>
<p>“It will be a challenging but manageable programme that has a real sense of personal and professional achievement plus recognition in both New Zealand and overseas,” says Associate Professor Nevan Wright, AUT Acting MBA Director.</p>
<p>The paper consists of 24 fully taught papers, with each lecture held twice a day 9am – midday and 5.30pm - 8.30pm Monday to Thursday, with Friday and the weekend off.</p>
<p>“It can be completed in 11 months full-time and will provide students with a tool box of techniques and models for all the key management disciplines – accounting, law, marketing, leadership, planning, operations management and strategy – rather than a research degree. There is no thesis,” Associate Professor Wright says.</p>
<p>The MBA is targeted at middle management who have reached a transitional point in their career and are striving for advancement. It recognizes prior work experience and learning with automatic entry at certain levels within such organisations as the Police, Air Force, Master Mariners, nursing and teaching.</p>
<p>“We recognise that all these people have strong qualifications in their own areas of expertise but often lack the complete training to become general managers at the senior level,” Associate Professor Wright says.</p>
<p>The AUT MBA is available to New Zealand and overseas students.</p>
