<p>Victoria students outraged by mass arrests</p>
<p>Victoria University students are disgusted that student action at Massey University, Palmerston North has resulted in mass arrests.</p>
<p>“We are outraged that our fellow students have been arrested for exercising their democratic right to protest the Massey University fee increase”, said Catherine Belfield-Haines Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) President. “We stand alongside Massey students, supporting their actions in full and concur that tertiary institutions are raising fees unnecessarily”.</p>
<p>“New Zealand university students will be unified in pressuring Steve Maharey demanding that he tighten up fee increases”, said Belfield-Haines. “Fee increases for 2004 are completely unnecessary and cannot be justified. Obviously Councils are just trying to milk the cash cow, and they need to be stopped.”</p>
<p>“Yesterday Victoria University students staged a funeral for freedom of speech - obviously such repression is not isolated to Wellington” said Belfield-Haines.</p>
<p>“If Universities Management think that a few arrests are going to deter outrage at fee increases, they are sadly mistaken”.</p>
