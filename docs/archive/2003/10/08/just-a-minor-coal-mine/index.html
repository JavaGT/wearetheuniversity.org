<p><strong>Wednesday, 8 October 2003, 12:31 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Just a minor coal mine...</p>
<p>The Green Party is warning that Environment Waikato&#39;s decision not to allow any public input into its decisions on a massive increase in coal mining signals a dangerous exclusion of environmental issues from Government decisions.</p>
<p>Solid Energy, a state owned enterprise, has used the recent &quot;limited notification&quot; amendment to the Resource Management Act, forced through by Labour a few months ago with the support of United, to limit scrutiny of its expanded Rotowaro mine, near Huntly, to just 17 neighbouring landowners.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greens fought tooth-and-nail against the RMA amendment,&quot; Green Co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said today. &quot;We warned that the new notification procedure would make it much harder for people to find out what developments are being planned for their communities and to have a say in what happens. At the time, the Minister said it was for projects like minor extensions to buildings.</p>
<p>&quot;But we always said it was inevitable that companies with no personal stake in the environment or local community would use &#39;limited notification&#39; to secretly push through projects that they know would engender enormous opposition from people who do care about their surroundings.</p>
<p>&quot;What is particularly disturbing about this case is how Environment Waikato could possibly designate a doubling of operations at the Huntly mine as having no more than &#39;minor effects&#39; on the environment, allowing Solid Energy to qualify for limited notification.</p>
<p>&quot;This meant that groups representing the public interest and the health of the environment, such as Forest and Bird and Greenpeace, were not allowed to make submissions at all.</p>

<p>&quot;If the effects on the environment and the neighbourhood of a 225 hectare-wide, 100 metre-deep coal mine are &#39;minor&#39;, then what qualifies as a &#39;major&#39; project?&quot; Ms Fitzsimons asked. &quot;The answer to that, we learned a few weeks ago, is going to be: whatever Jim Anderton decides is of &#39;national significance.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;Not content with cutting communities and environmentalists out of &#39;minor&#39; decision-making the Government is now planning to drive a tractor through the RMA by handing decisions on fast tracking &#39;Think Big&#39; projects to Mr Anderton, further reducing public scrutiny.</p>
<p>&quot;What will be left for the public to comment on? Only a few projects deemed to be &quot;middle sized&quot;, or not favoured by the Government,&quot; said Ms Fitzsimons. &quot;We are heading back to the pre-RMA days when big government projects were allowed to pre-empt democracy and the environment.  </p>
