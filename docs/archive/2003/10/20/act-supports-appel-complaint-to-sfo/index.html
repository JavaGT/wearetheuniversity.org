<p>ACT Supports APPEL Complaint To SFO</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today welcomed the Association of Private Providers of English Language&#39;s decision to lodge a complaint to the Serious Fraud Office about potential fraud related to the closure of the Modern Age English language school.</p>
<p>&quot;APPEL has outlined aspects of concern surrounding Modern Age&#39;s closure that, it believes, may have arisen through fraud. These concerns are: a potential misuse of funds that should have been in an independent trust account - as required under the Education Act 1989 - and the potential enrolment of students in an course not approved by the NZQA,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;This week I received a letter of reply from Education Minister Trevor Mallard regarding the NZQA&#39;s failure to recognise - before it was too late - the dire financial position of Modern Age. His letter raised more questions than it answered. I have submitted a further OIA seeking further information in an effort to get to the bottom of this sorry saga.</p>
<p>&quot;The collapse of Modern Age could have huge implications for our private English language industry. It is worth more than $300 million in export earnings and employs thousands of New Zealanders. The negative publicity surrounding Modern Age&#39;s failure could cause enormous damage to the industry.</p>
<p>&quot;I congratulate APPEL for taking this course of action. It is crucial that it sends a strong message that it will not tolerate any bending of the rules. The future well-being of the industry is at stake,&quot; Miss Coddington said.  </p>
