<p>Research Shows Need For Early Childhood Teachers To Be Qualified</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa says research released by the government highlights the need to have qualified teachers working in the early childhood sector.</p>
<p>The research was commissioned by the Ministry of Education and outlines effective ways of improving children’s learning at early childhood level. It highlights the importance of teachers being given the time and support they need to develop ways of improving their students outcomes and developing their teaching practices.</p>
<p>The research points out that it is difficult designing professional development programmes in New Zealand’s early child sector because the education background and qualifications of the teachers is so varied.</p>
<p>“This reinforces the importance of the government requirement that all teachers in registered early childhood education centres be qualified and registered by 2012,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Bruce Adin.</p>
<p>“Organisations such as the Early Childhood Council and the Education Forum, which is linked to the Business Round Table, continue to question the need for early childhood teachers to be qualified”</p>
<p>“Their concern is the cost to the owners and managers of private and community early childhood centres, of having qualified teachers. NZEI’s concern is the cost to New Zealand’s children of not having qualified teachers.”</p>
<p>“The union congratulates the government on recognising the importance of children getting a good start in life and that investing in early childhood education pays huge dividends, not just for the children but for the whole country.”</p>
<p>“The key to making that investment pay is to spend the money on ensuring that early childhood centres have qualified teachers who receive the on-going professional development they need, so that the children get the quality education they need to prepare them for school and for life,” says Bruce Adin.  </p>
