<p>Otago&#39;s ballooning deficit will mean cuts to services</p>
<p>The Otago District Health Board&#39;s ballooning deficit shows the Government is neglecting core health services in the region, says National Health Spokesperson Dr Lynda Scott.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government&#39;s main pledge regarding health was that it would &quot;focus on patients, not profit&quot; before the last election.</p>
<p>&quot;Otago people are now seeing there is no substance to those promises. This large deficit means reduced services and longer waits for surgery.</p>
<p>&quot;The result is a severe rationing of secondary services. Otago&#39;s hospitals and patients are the losers, and the effect is wide-reaching in Otago and Southland.</p>
<p>&quot;In contrast the Government is spending $400m on Primary Health Organisations (PHOs), where the funding for doctors&#39; visits is unfair and based on race and location. They are pouring money into these flawed PHOs and neglecting secondary services.</p>
<p>&quot;Patients will suffer and it begs the question as to why anyone in Otago who cares about health would vote for Labour,&quot; Dr Scott said.  </p>
