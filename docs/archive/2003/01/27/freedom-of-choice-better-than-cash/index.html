<p>Freedom Of Choice Better Than Cash</p>
<p>Monday 27 Jan 2003 Deborah Coddington Press Releases -- Education</p>
<p>Instead of giving cash bonuses to schools that reduce student suspensions, the Government should simply give choice to parents, ACT New Zealand Associate Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Every mum and dad should be free to choose which school they send their children to, instead of politicians and bureaucrats dictating where their children are educated,&quot; Ms Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not just drug use that contributes to student suspensions, but the top down, `one size fits all&#39; state education system. For instance, the Government closed Auckland&#39;s Metropolitan College, which suited many pupils unable to cope with the more rigid structure of other state schools in the same zone.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of those former Metro students then became `problem&#39; students at their new schools. Simply throwing cash incentives at schools will not work, as it puts all responsibility on schools - when, often, parents should be forced to be accountable for their misbehaving children.</p>
<p>This Government must accept what the rest of the world is doing - extracting the state from all but the funding of education services, giving choice to parents and, thus, leaving more money to pay good teachers more,&quot; said Ms Coddington.</p>
