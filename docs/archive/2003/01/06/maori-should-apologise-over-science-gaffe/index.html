<p><strong>Monday, 6 January 2003, 12:03 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Maori should apologise over science gaffe</p>
<p>The National Party’s calling for Ngai Tahu to apologise to New Zealand’s scientific community after remarks made after the scuttling of research into rock lobsters and paua.</p>
<p>National’s Science spokesman Dr Paul Hutchison is commenting on Canterbury University Professor Frank Sin’s announcement to abandon genetic research into improving the growth of lobster and paua because of Maori concerns.</p>
<p>“Ngai Tahu spokesman Whiti Reia’s been reported as saying Maori should be consulted because ‘the public in general do not trust scientists’.</p>
<p>“It’s highly disturbing for a Maori spokesman to make such loose statements about scientists which are simply not based on fact.</p>
<p>“Some of the greatest benefits to Maori and all New Zealanders have come from scientific advances in medicine, agriculture and industry,” Dr Hutchison says.</p>
<p>“I wonder what Mr Reia would say about scientists and their purpose if diseases like those which struck oysters and mussels hit our paua or lobster fisheries.</p>
<p>“In my view New Zealand should honour its scientists,” says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>“They’re under funded and undervalued but committed to improving the lives of all Kiwis.</p>
<p>New Zealand has some of the most rigorous and responsible legislative frameworks for scientific research of anywhere in the world,” Dr Hutchison says.</p>
<p>“And clearly the real challenge now is for as many people as possible in New Zealand to become scientifically literate.</p>
<p>“It would be a tragedy if the understanding of our flora and fauna was compromised because of unfounded prejudice.</p>
<p>“I now believe Mr Reia’s reported remarks require clarification or an apology,” Dr Hutchison says.</p>
