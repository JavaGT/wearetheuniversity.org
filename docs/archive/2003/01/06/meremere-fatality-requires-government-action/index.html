<p>Meremere fatality requires Government action</p>
<p>Yet another tragic road death at Meremere illustrates the need for the Government to take urgent action at one of the Waikato’s most notorious accident black spots, says the MP for Port Waikato, National’s Dr Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>“New Zealand‘s just heard that the road toll for last year was the lowest in a decade, yet by international standards it remains too high.</p>
<p>“Many of our major roads are not safe and the Government should not be complacent,” Dr Hutchison says.</p>
<p>“It has been identified that the next big step to decrease our road toll is improving the roads and it’s time the Government started backing its words with action.</p>
<p>“I’m totally behind a local initiative for a safe Waikato Expressway to be built and preferably in the next ten years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dr Hutchison also says the Government’s roading legislation is too timid.</p>
<p>“I have had constituents and local police literally weeping in my office over the continued and unnecessary tragedies on that stretch of road between Meremere and Huntly.</p>
<p>“The Government’s taking far too long to make any improvements,” Dr Hutchison says.</p>
