<p>Foreign buy-up wrecks home-ownership hopes</p>
<p>Land-grabbing foreign speculators are stealing the own-your-own-home dreams of thousands of young and less well-off New Zealanders, Green Party Co-leader Rod Donald said today.</p>
<p>The latest AMP Home Affordability Survey indicates that it is becoming increasingly difficult for New Zealanders to afford to own their own home.</p>
<p>“A significant factor in the skyrocketing price of property is the buy-up of pristine coastal land by overseas-based investors who want a haven from the misery they’ve helped create in their own countries,” said Rod Donald.</p>
<p>“This in turn artificially inflates the whole housing market, pushing even modest properties out of the reach of many New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“We have no problem at all with foreigners who are prepared to move to this country and become New Zealand citizens. What we don’t want are bolt-hole billionaires driving up land prices and then just using Aotearoa as a holiday-home.”</p>
<p>Rod Donald is preparing a private member’s bill which would change the Overseas Investment Act to ban the sale and long-term lease of New Zealand property to foreign investors.</p>
<p>“The Government should also be encouraging the increasing numbers of people who cannot afford to buy a home by increasing the stock of public housing and introducing more schemes to allow lower-income people to raise the deposit for their own homes.”</p>
