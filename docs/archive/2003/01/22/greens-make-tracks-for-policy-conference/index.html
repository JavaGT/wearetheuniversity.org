<p>Greens make tracks for policy conference</p>
<p>Most Green MPs are making their way to the Green Party’s annual summer policy conference in Masterton by train on Thursday 23 January, to draw attention to the need for a strong, viable national rail system.</p>
<p>Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said it was essential for New Zealand to have a fully functioning, flexible and comfortable public transport system that meets the needs of the travelling public. “Bendy tracks are undermining confidence in the rail system and this will take years to reverse,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons said Green MPs were showing their support for rail, by making their way to the policy conference at Solway College by train, rather than in taxis or rental cars.</p>
<p>The Greens are also reminding the public and the Government that they have been calling for the Government to take back the track since April 2001, and want to see some action soon.</p>
<p>Eight Green MPs - Ms Fitzsimons, Co-Leader Rod Donald, Sue Bradford, Nandor Tanczos, Sue Kedgley, Ian Ewen-Street, Keith Locke and Mike Ward - will gather at 5.15pm on Thursday 23 January on the platform for the Wairarapa train, at Wellington Railway Station before boarding the 5.29pm Wairarapa train.</p>
<p>The MPs will disembark at the Solway stop for the conference, which runs from Friday January 24 to Sunday January 26. The conference venue was chosen partly because it is right by a rail station so that many members could leave their cars at home.</p>
<p>The remaining Green MP, Metiria Turei, is travelling to the conference by train on Thursday 23 January at the earlier time of 12.55pm, as she has other commitments.</p>
