<p><strong>Thursday, 30 January 2003, 12:05 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>A Victoria University management specialist will be putting his skills and knowledge to good use as the new Head of the Victoria Management School.</p>
<p>Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh said Dr Brad Jackson had been appointed as Head of School for a three-year term, beginning on January 21. Dr Jackson replaces Professor Walsh, who took up the role of Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Commerce and Administration on January 1.</p>
<p>Professor Walsh said Dr Jackson would play a key role in developing the culture of the new School, formed last year from the Graduate School of Business &amp; Government Management and the School of Business and Public Management.</p>
<p>&quot;The School&#39;s staff are committed to teaching and research of the highest quality and working with people in the business and management communities to achieve that vision. Dr Jackson, with his substantial qualifications and knowledge, has the skills and contacts to grow the School and further develop its relationships with the wider community.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Jackson, previously a Senior Lecturer in the School, has a Bachelor of Science degree from Bristol University, a Master of Arts degree from the University of British Columbia and a Doctor of Philosophy degree from Lancaster University.</p>
<p>Dr Jackson currently teaches organisational behaviour, change management and organisational development in the BCA, MBA, MMS, Diploma of Human Resource Management and Certificate in Management Studies programmes.</p>
<p>Dr Jackson&#39;s research into the management advice industry resulted in the publication of Management Gurus and Management Fashions in March 2001 as well as host of journal articles and book chapters. Together with Dr Ken Parry, the director of the Centre for the Study of Leadership, he also co-authored The Hero Manager: Learning from New Zealand&#39;s Top Chief Executives, also published in 2001.</p>
