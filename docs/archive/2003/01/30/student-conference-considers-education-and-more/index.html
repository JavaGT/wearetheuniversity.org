<p>National student conference considers education and more</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) Conference currently being held in Wellington sees the widest group of tertiary students in memory meeting to discuss big issues in education and beyond.</p>
<p>“Students from every university and college of education, and three polytechnics, are gathered for our first conference of the year,” said Conference Spokesperson, Wellington Trainee Teachers Association President Greg Henderson. “Over 120 delegates from this range of institutions is one of the biggest and most representative student meetings in memory.”</p>
<p>“Tertiary students face huge issues this year. This conference will be talking about how to make Labour’s election promise to widen access to student allowances a reality soon, and to see the long-awaited review of student support deliver the goods for students and graduates,” said Henderson. “We also want to raise our concerns about the government’s secret plans to introduce private savings schemes based on American tertiary funding.”</p>
<p>NZUSA Co-President and Conference Spokesperson Roz Connelly said that the conference would be looking at issues other than tertiary education. “Green MP Keith Locke will be addressing the conference on the so-called war on terror. The timing could not be more pressing after George Bush’s most recent speech.”</p>
<p>“Students have a long history of leading anti-war movements,” said Connelly. “This conference will see students consider their reaction to the imminent attacks on Iraq. Student leaders will be taking information and ideas back to their own campuses on this and other issues.”</p>
<p>The conference is running from Thursday 29 January to Saturday 1 February at St Johns Church and at the Wellington College of Education.</p>
