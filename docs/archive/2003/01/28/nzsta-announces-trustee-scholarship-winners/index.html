<p>NZSTA announces trustee scholarship winners</p>
<p>Five school trustees will be joining students with heads in their books this year, with the New Zealand Trustee Association’s announcement today that they’ve each won a $4,000 scholarship.</p>
<p>Each year the Crombie Lockwood/Royal &amp; SunAlliance Study Awards are offered to school trustees who are keen to further their studies for personal or professional development within New Zealand or overseas.</p>
<p>The 2003 winners are: Chris Haines, Aparima College, Southland; Jane Thistlethwaite, Homai National School for Blind and Vision Impaired, Hamilton; Hilary Stace, Onslow College, Wellington; Carol Kelly, Newbury School, Palmerston North; Selwyn Bracegirdle, St Patrick’s College, Wellington.</p>
<p>NZSTA President Chris France says school trustees bring a wide variety of skills and expertise from all walks of life, and the association welcomes the chance to recognise their professionalism and offer them an opportunity for further training.</p>
<p>He says the research and study topics chosen by the study award winners will benefit them, their schools and the wider community, and trusteeship generally.</p>
<p>Chris France welcomes the diversity of this year’s topics.</p>
<p>“They are extremely valuable, and include research into school transport; the compilation of a guide for Boards of Trustees on school reunions, archives and trusts; and attending the South Pacific Education of Vision Impaired Conference in Australia.”</p>
<p>The $20,000 scholarship programme was introduced four years ago at NZSTA’s 10th birthday, which celebrated a decade of self-governing schools.</p>
<p>Chris France says NZSTA values the generous support of insurance brokers Crombie Lockwood and insurer, Royal &amp; SunAlliance in sponsoring the award and acknowledging the huge commitment that school trustees make to New Zealand’s education system.  </p>
