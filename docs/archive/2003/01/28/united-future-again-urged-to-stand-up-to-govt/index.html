<p><strong>Tuesday, 28 January 2003, 6:20 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>United Future again urged to stand up to Govt</p>
<p>United Future must put its money where its mouth is and back up its words with action, according to the National Party Transport spokesman Roger Sowry.</p>
<p>&quot;Peter Dunne&#39;s Transport spokesman has accused the Government of &#39;taking Kiwis for a ride&#39; with its transport policies.</p>
<p>&quot;But it&#39;s Larry Baldock who&#39;s taking voters for a ride,&quot; Mr Sowry says.</p>
<p>&quot;If United Future are so opposed to the Land Transport Amendment Bill I urge them (yet again) not to vote for it at the select committee stage.</p>
<p>&quot;And if New Zealanders are to take their convictions seriously, then surely United Future is the only Party that can keep the Government honest,&quot; says Mr Sowry.</p>
<p>&quot;If Mr Dunne&#39;s mob are so strongly opposed to Government initiatives, why is the Party still handing Labour its vote on issues of confidence and supply?</p>
<p>&quot;The only possible answer is now that United Future&#39;s got its Family Commission, the Party&#39;s expected to rubber stamp everything else.</p>
<p>&quot;United Future should honour its pre-election promises and stop driving the thousands of Kiwis who lent them their vote to despair,&quot; Mr Sowry says.</p>
