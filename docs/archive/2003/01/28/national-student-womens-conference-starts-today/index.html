<p><strong>Tuesday, 28 January 2003, 9:18 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Media Advisory: National Student Women’s Conference starts today</p>
<p>Where: St John’s in the City, Cnr Dixon and Willis St, Wellington<br>When: Tuesday 28 and Wednesday 29 January<br>Who: Women on Student Executives from around New Zealand (Colleges of Education, Polytechnics and Universities)</p>
<p>For the next two days women students from around New Zealand will meet to discuss issues affecting women students, who are still not sharing the benefits enjoyed by their male classmates. “The biggest gender pay gap is between men and women with tertiary qualifications,” said Camilla Belich, NZUSA National Women’s Rights Officer. “We take twice as long as men on average to repay our student loans. Feminism on campus is vital if we’re to take on these issues and achieve fairer policies for women.”</p>
<p>“Too many people think we have moved past women’s issues because we have so many women in power,” said Belich. “This conference is not about ignoring how far we have come but about recognising the reality of our situation as women in New Zealand. The fact is that women are still underpaid, receive too little support in the workforce, pay more for our tertiary education and face sexism every day. ”</p>
<p>High profile women including Jane Kelsey and Minister of Women’s Affairs Ruth Dyson will address the conference. Workshops will focus on Human Rights, Women in Sport, Mana Wahine, Pay Equity and User Pays, and Homophobia.</p>
