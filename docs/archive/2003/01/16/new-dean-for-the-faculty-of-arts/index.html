<p>New Dean For The University Of Auckland Faculty Of Arts</p>
<p>The University of Auckland has announced the appointment of Professor John Morrow as Dean of the Faculty of Arts.</p>
<p>Professor Morrow, who is currently a Professor of Political Studies, will succeed Professor Doug Sutton as Dean on 1 April 2003. He came to The University of Auckland in 2002 from Victoria University of Wellington, where he had been Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Research).</p>
<p>Announcing the appointment, the Vice-Chancellor Dr John Hood said that Professor Morrow brings considerable administrative knowledge, an excellent research reputation and many years of teaching experience to the post.</p>
<p>“Professor Morrow is well equipped to lead the Faculty as it builds on the very strong foundations laid in recent years,” Dr Hood said.</p>
<p>“A vibrant and productive Arts faculty lies at the core of any successful research-led University and is a key component of how the University acts as critic and conscience of society.</p>
<p>“With around 8,500 students and 26 Departments, Schools and Research Centres, the Faculty of Arts is amongst the largest and most diverse in Australasia. But, crucially, it has matched its size with an excellent reputation for research and teaching.</p>
<p>“Growth in externally funded research in the Faculty over the past five years, for example, has been exceptional. Income from external sources has risen from $1.8 million in 1997 to $12 million in 2001. Similarly, success in Marsden Fund awards reflects the underlying strength of the Faculty. Since 1995, 43% of Social Sciences and Humanities projects funded by the Marsden Fund have been based at The University of Auckland.”</p>

<p>“It is important for the University, and for the many fields to which the Faculty’s writers, artists, historians and social scientists contribute that the Faculty continues to build on its many strengths,” Dr Hood said.</p>
<p>Professor Morrow received a BA and MA in Political Science from the University of Canterbury and his PhD in Social and Political Thought from York University, Canada. Prior to his appointment as Professor at The University of Auckland in 2002, Professor Morrow was based primarily at Victoria University, where he received a Personal Chair in Politics. He has also been the Bye Fellow at Cambridge University in 1984, 1991, 1995, and in 2001 was a Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities, University of Edinburgh. His many administrative responsibilities at Victoria University culminated in his appointment as Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Research), 1997-2001.</p>
<p>Professor Morrow’s research interests and publications have focused on the history of nineteenth and early twentieth century British and European political thought, and on modern political philosophy.</p>
<p>Recent publications include, The History of Political Thought: A Thematic Introduction, Macmillan, 1998, and Young England: The New Generation, Leicester University Press, 1999. He is currently working on a study of Thomas Carlyle and the Victorian context commissioned for London Book’s Eminent Victorians Series.</p>
