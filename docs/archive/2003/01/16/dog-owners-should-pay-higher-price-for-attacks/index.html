<p><strong>Thursday, 16 January 2003, 1:57 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Dog owners should pay higher price for attacks</p>
<p>There’s a new call today for the Government to toughen up the penalties against the owners of dogs that go on to attack people.</p>
<p>“The fact that two children have been viciously attacked in South Auckland within a week highlights a situation that can very often be prevented,” says Port Waikato MP Dr Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>“It’s a parents worst nightmare,” says the father of three young children.</p>
<p>“In the South Auckland case where a Rotweiller dog mauled a six year old, the dog could be destroyed and the owner fined $1500 or jailed for three months.</p>
<p>“The dog was not registered which means the owner could be fined a further $1200,” says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>“The law as it stands is simply not credible and doesn’t reflect the seriousness of the act.</p>
<p>“In my view the penalties should be quadrupled to become an effective deterrent,” says Dr Hutchison.</p>
