<p>Minister Must Answer For Kahukura Fiasco</p>
<p>The Film Commission and the Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage have been callously cavalier in their attitude toward creditors of Kahukura Productions Ltd, ACT&#39;s Small Business Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Unsecured creditors Tony Lynch and Brenda Jessup, owners of catering company Ministry of Food, are owed at least $15,000 by the failed film company,&quot; said Ms Coddington.</p>
<p>&quot;In December the Jessups told the Dominion Post they were `outraged and angry&#39; the Commission had not alerted creditors to the problems with Kahukura.</p>
<p>&quot;Judith Tizard has previously denied reports that the Commission knew of Kahukura&#39;s financial problems before $2.2 million of taxpayers&#39; money was advanced to the troubled company. However, Peter Jackson&#39;s Film Unit logged a phone call on March 5, 2002 to the Commission, alerting it to the fact that a Kahukura Production cheque had bounced.</p>
<p>&quot;But, now, Ms Tizard has indeed admitted - in answer to my written questions - that the Commission did actually know about Kahukura&#39;s problems. The Minister has misled the public over this.</p>
<p>&quot;However, she airily dismisses concerns about sharing this information with other creditors, claiming the Commission had `no legal right to alert creditors&#39;. Her justification for this arrogant behaviour is self-serving nonsense.</p>
<p>&quot;Another answer from the Minister confirms that the Commission made no checks about Kahukura Productions&#39; financial viability prior to signing the $2.2 million deal - despite the fact that in the 1980s Larry Parr&#39;s film company, Mirage, went bust owing thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>&quot;If Judith Tizard was signing $2 million of her own money across to someone associated with companies with a chequered financial past, I&#39;m sure she&#39;d do due diligence. However, when it comes to taxpayers&#39; money the same rules do not seem to apply.</p>
<p>&quot;She is clearly unsuitable for the job of representing all those involved in arts, culture and heritage, and should resign,&quot; said Ms Coddington.</p>
