<p>At the Forum Mr Cosgrove will meet a number of high profile political, academic and business leaders people including: General Wesley Clark former NATO Commander, Pauline Marois Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Economy and Research of Quebec, Eva Biaudet Minister of Health and Social Services of Finland, Ian Goldin, Director of Development Policy at the World Bank, Austan Goolsbee Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago, Florencio Lopez-de-Silanes Director, International Institute for Corporate Governance at the Yale School of Management, Fareed Zakaria Editor, Newsweek International and Andre Dua Associate Principal McKinsey &amp; Company Inc USA.</p>

King Abdullah II of Jordan, Grant Aldonas US Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade, John Ashcroft US Attorney-General, Alec Urwin Minister of Trade and Industry of South Africa and Donald Johnston Secretary-General of the OECD.</p>
<p>Last year Mr Cosgrove was appointed a member of the World Economic Forum’s Free Trade Task Force which will meet during the Annual Meeting.</p>
<p>The Task Force, whose objective is to promote global trade liberalisation, is co-ordinated by Matthew Cadbury, a former senior executive of Cadbury Schweppes Hudson. The purpose of the group is to encourage faster progress towards free trade as a means to increase wealth in the world and reduce poverty.</p>
<p>Members of the task force include Ian Goldin, Director of Development Policy at the World Bank in Washington, David Kamenetzky, an Associate at the leading investments firm Goldman Sachs in Germany, and Paola Ghillani, Chief Executive Officer of Switzerland’s Max Havelaar Foundation (a company dedicated to opening the markets of developed countries under fair and sustainable conditions of trade).</p>
<p>&quot;I am looking forward to once again attending the Forum’s Annual Meeting. It is a great honour and gives me the opportunity to interact with and learn from some of the world’s great political leaders and entrepreneurs and bring back some new and innovative ideas to this country. I also look forward to renewing old friendships and networks with people from around the world who are key supporters of New Zealand and it’s many trading and commercial causes&quot;, Mr Cosgrove said.</p>

<p>Active task forces and initiatives that have grown out of the GLT activities range from environmental sustainability, the changing face of healthcare and the future of Europe to the prospects of leadership and service, and the social impact of new technology.</p>
