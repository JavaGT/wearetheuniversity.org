<p><strong>Tuesday, 21 January 2003, 6:44 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>What’s the Minister hiding?</p>
<p>The National Party is questioning glowing new figures produced by the Associate Education Minister which he claims shows significant growth in Tertiary Education enrolments.</p>
<p>“But the Minister’s office is refusing to release the statistics to the Opposition for closer scrutiny,” says National’s Tertiary Education spokesman Simon Power.</p>
<p>“The National Party has been told the figures won’t be made public until they’re published on the Ministry of Education’s web-site this Friday.</p>
<p>“How can these statistics be properly questioned or given any credibility when the Minister is refusing to release all of them?</p>
<p>“I’m pleased to see there appears to be an increase in Maori participation in Tertiary Education, but the Minister’s selective release leaves several unanswered questions,” says Mr Power.</p>
<p>“For instance; what was the percentage increase in enrolments at Private Training Establishments (or PTE’s)?</p>
<p>“What was the increase in Maori and Pacific Island participation at PTE’s?</p>
<p>“And what were the over-all rates of participation of Maori and non-Maori at PTE’s?</p>
<p>“We already know this is a Government that likes to control what we think, but this kind of selective press release is taking media management one step too far,” Mr Power says.</p>
