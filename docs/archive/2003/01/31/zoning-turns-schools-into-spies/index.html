<p>Zoning Turns Schools into Spies</p>
<p>Successful schools, especially in the Auckland area, are being punished by the Government&#39;s extreme authoritarian zoning policies, ACT New Zealand Associate Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;When I was on the Board of Trustees last year of a popular Auckland school we had to check suspicious enrolments by knocking on doors at 7.30 in the morning.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents - many from South Auckland - were just trying to get the best education for their girls but their local school was just not of their choosing. They hated me - and justifiably so - for standing in the way of their daughters&#39; education.</p>
<p>&quot;However, our school was required by law to carry out the Minister&#39;s policy and the Board of Trustees was the `meat in the sandwich&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Today I see that Macleans College, in Howick, is hiring private detectives to investigate dubious enrolments.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks to Macleans&#39; outstanding principal, Byron Bentley, and fantastic teaching staff, Macleans College has extremely high academic achievements. Students at Macleans are among the best in the country, this year gaining 112 A Bursary passes, 78 B Bursaries, and 86 Scholarships.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course this makes the school even more popular, and its roll is reaching crisis point, up to 2084 from 1759 in 2001,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time Education Minister Trevor Mallard faced reality and introduced policies which would give choice to parents. Schools should not be spending valuable resources on hiring private investigators. That&#39;s money that could be paying good teachers more.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s Mums and Dads who know best where to send their children to school, not the Minister of Education.&quot;  </p>
