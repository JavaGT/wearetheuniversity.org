<p>Light At End Of Tunnel For Rail Intersection Improvements</p>
<p>New Zealand First MP Ron is on track to improve safety at a North Canterbury level crossing after a truck driver collided with a freight train in November.</p>
<p>Mr Mark met with Transit NZ officials in Christchurch this week in a bid to resolve a disagreement between authorities over who is responsible for improvements to the Fernside Rd level crossing.</p>
<p>A lack of safety barrier and lights at the intersection has been blamed for several accidents in recent years – the latest of which resulted in a truck driver being hospitalised for over four weeks and left him with permanent head injuries.</p>
<p>“It is obvious that an upgrade to this crossing is urgently needed before another devastating accident. I have been approached by the family of the family of the truck driver and a number of residents worried that the next collision at Fernside Rd will involve deaths which could have been prevented,” said Mr Mark.</p>
<p>“Transit NZ were positive about fast-tracking improvements to the level crossing and agreed to be involved in a round table discussion with the two other invoved parties – Waimakariri District Countil and Tranzrail,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr Mark is expected to meet with representatives of Tranzrail, the Mayor of Rangiora and the Land Transport Safety Authority shortly.  </p>
