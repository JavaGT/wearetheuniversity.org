<p>Students Deserve Better</p>
<p>Education Minister Trevor Mallard should apologise to students for the serious delay in releasing NCEA results, ACT New Zealand Associate Education spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;School Certificate results would have been out by now. NCEA results, however, will not be known before January 24 - about three days before students return to school,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;How on earth are students expected to finalise their courses and subjects in this time frame?</p>
<p>&quot;The Qualifications Authority, which Mr Mallard is responsible for, blandly dismisses concerns about delays, and blames them on the high number of standards sat by students. Well they&#39;ve actually known for about six months, since enrolment, how many standards were being examined. The NCEA is self-funding so they can&#39;t blame a lack of resources.</p>
<p>&quot;Also, since no actual marks are given, the results should be easier to determine and release. If anything, NCEA marks should have been out earlier than School Certificate used to be.</p>
<p>&quot;This is totally unfair on students, their parents, and educators.</p>
<p>&quot;I have written today to the Minister of Education to ask why there is a delay, and if he&#39;s satisfied with the way these results are being handled. NCEA already lacks any credibility. Mr Mallard should be ashamed,&quot; Miss Coddington said.  </p>
