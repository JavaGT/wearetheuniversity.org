<p><strong>Thursday, 7 August 2003, 10:57 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Misinformation from Land Information Minister</p>
<p>National Party Environment spokesman Nick Smith is accusing the Land Information Minister of muddying the waters with a misinformation campaign on the beaches and seabed issue.</p>
<p>&quot;Land Information Minister John Tamihere is deliberately spreading misinformation about the current ownership of New Zealand&#39;s foreshore in a bid to muddy the waters over controversial iwi claims.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Tamihere has been widely quoted as saying significant chunks of the foreshore are in private ownership and he stood by his comments in Parliament this week when I asked if he was &#39;talking thousands and not hundreds of kilometres of private title&#39;. *</p>
<p>&quot;Just last night Mr Tamihere repeated his claims &#39;I&#39;m saying two thirds are in the public domain and at this stage one third ah ah... one third of the beaches are potentially privately owned&#39;. ** &quot;Mr Tamihere has gone on to accuse me of &#39;telling porkies&#39; when I quoted from Official Conservation Department papers that say less than 1% of our foreshore is privately owned.</p>
<p>&quot;I was quoting the top solicitor for DOC who&#39;s responsible for the foreshore, Timothy Mansfield, who gave the Planning and Development Select Committee in August 1993 a written briefing specifically on foreshore ownership,&quot; Dr Smith says.</p>
<p>&quot;At the time she said &#39;the proportion of private title is probably very small (less than 1% of the coastline)&#39;. ***</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Tamihere has been deliberately confusing the issue of Queen&#39;s Chain above the high tide mark with the foreshore,&quot; Dr Smith says.</p>

<p>&quot;He&#39;s trying to take some heat away from the Government&#39;s deal with Maori over ownership of the foreshore.</p>
<p>&quot;It is spin out of control and it has back-fired.</p>
<p>We cannot have the Minister of Land Information spreading misinformation about land.</p>
<p>&quot;He has to either deliver the proof to back up his claims or apologise to the Parliament and the people of New Zealand for his incorrect statements,&quot; Dr Smith says.  </p>
