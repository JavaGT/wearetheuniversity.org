<p>There&#39;s more than one way to kill a moth</p>
<p>Green MP Ian Ewen-Street is calling on MAF to learn from its Auckland mistakes and abandon plans for an aerial spraying campaign over Hamilton.</p>
<p>&quot;The asian gypsy moth does indeed pose a threat to our forests,&quot; said Mr Ewen-Street, the Green Biosecurity and Agriculture spokesperson. &quot;But only one male moth has been found and there are a number of alternative strategies that should be tried before dousing the people of Hamilton in a chemical cocktail.</p>
<p>&quot;A powerful artificial pheromone exists which would be effective at trapping and eliminating small numbers of moths.</p>
<p>&quot;Why not use it first to determine the extent of the infestation and then consider more drastic options if the trapping regime shows the moth is more widely established?</p>
<p>&quot;Drenching a city the size of Hamilton with the sort of chemical mix needed to be effective against the moth is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</p>
<p>&quot;Given its mishandling of the painted apple moth campaign in Auckland, MAF has a vested interest in playing-down the health effects of aerial spray but the facts speak for themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;Thousands of Aucklanders caught in the spray zone have reported ill-effects, with children, the elderly and people with asthma being particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p>&quot;It is irresponsible to inflict this misery on the people of Hamilton when all possible alternatives have not been exhausted,&quot; said Mr Ewen-Street.  </p>
