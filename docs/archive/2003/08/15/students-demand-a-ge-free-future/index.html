<p><strong>Friday, 15 August 2003, 5:13 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association">Victoria University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Students demand a GE-Free future</p>
<p>&#39;The passage of three motions opposing genetic engineering during the lunchtime Student Representative Council meeting at Victoria University is a victory for all New Zealanders who want a GE-Free future&#39; said Valerie Morse, student activist.</p>
<p>The three motions were first, that the Victoria University Students Association (VUWSA) oppose the lifting of the moratorium on genetic engineering; second, that VUWSA actively campaign for a GE-Free (food) campus and finally, that VUWSA urge the university administration to join the GE-Free Register. &#39;Students at Vic are concerned about the risks associated with GE. The repeated corn contamination scandals have demonstrated that the government&#39;s claim that GE can co-exist with conventional crops is nonsense.&#39;</p>
<p>&#39;New Zealand has one of the best environmental images in the world. We are the clean and green land. We will lose that if we allow the growing of genetically modified commercial crops. The government says biosecurity is our biggest environmental issue and yet they are quite willing to allow this technology free reign without any understanding of the long term implications for our nation.&#39;</p>
<p>The Students Association will be communicating the results of these motions to the government and to university administration, as well as working to ensure that food provided on campus is GE-Free.  </p>
