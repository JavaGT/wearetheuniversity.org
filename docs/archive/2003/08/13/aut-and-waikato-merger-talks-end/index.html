<p>AUT and Waikato Merger Talks End</p>
<p>AUT&#39;s governing Council last night decided not to proceed at this stage with merger discussions with Waikato University, and intends to proceed with the process of appointing a new Vice-Chancellor prior to Christmas.</p>
<p>Both institutions have spent the past six weeks considering the academic and business cases for a merger.</p>
<p>AUT Chancellor Wyn Hoadley said today that AUT had determined through this process that the most pressing business issue for the University right now is the appointment of a new Vice-Chancellor.</p>
<p>&quot;Our investigations have discovered that the case for a merger with Waikato is not compelling enough to come ahead of the appointment of a new Vice-Chancellor.</p>
<p>&quot;However, we have welcomed discussions about co-operative possibilities with Waikato and are encouraged by the co-operative engagements already in place. AUT remains open to continuing to explore other ways to work together in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;We know from the investigative process we have worked through that to remain on our own path of consolidation and individual development is a strong and viable one. We have confidence in our own capacity to grow and succeed into the future,&quot; Mrs Hoadley said.  </p>
