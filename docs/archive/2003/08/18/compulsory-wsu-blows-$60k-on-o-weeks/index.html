<p>COMPULSORY WSU BLOWS $60K ON O-WEEKS</p>
<p>News that over the past two years the compulsory Waikato Students Union (WSU) has lost $60,000 on orientation week events is yet another argument against compulsory membership of student associations, Student Choice said today.</p>
<p>Spokesman Glenn Peoples said compulsory membership of WSU was behind the huge loss. &quot;This year compulsory membership gave WSU $540,000 which student politicians used to gamble in the highly competitive entertainment area. Even though $60,000 has been lost, next year Waikato students will be forced to pay WSU another $540,000,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s outrageous that student associations are wasting money in this way. People attend university to obtain an education, not to have their money taken and wasted by student politicians pretending to be pub owners and promoters,&quot; Peoples said.</p>
<p>Students should remember that compulsory membership is made possible by Steve Maharey&#39;s education amendment act. &quot;Students&#39; money will continue to be wasted as long as Maharey&#39;s law allows students to be forced to join student associations before they can study,&quot; Peoples said.</p>
<p>Peoples said WSU&#39;s loss is a warning for Auckland University students. &quot;Compulsory membership gives student politicians huge amounts of money which they regularly waste on harebrained ventures. Auckland students should avoid compulsory membership which gives money and power to unaccountable student politicians,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Student Choice upholds voluntary student association membership for all students on the grounds of freedom of association.</p>
