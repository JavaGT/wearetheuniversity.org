<p>New Zealand Patients First, Minister</p>
<p>Thursday 28 Aug 2003 Heather Roy Press Releases -- Health</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Health Spokesman Heather Roy today accused Health Minister Annette King of giving non-residents free healthcare at the expense of hard-working New Zealand taxpayers, in light of reports that foreign mothers are coming to New Zealand to give birth.</p>
<p>&quot;It is completely unacceptable that the Minister allows around 1,300 non-residents to receive free healthcare while they give birth - especially when around 500 of these women are from countries that do not have reciprocal health arrangements with New Zealand,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;And this is only the tip of the iceberg - it is not just expectant mothers who get a free ride. Foreign students receive free medical care, pharmaceuticals and counselling and, just recently, we have seen high-profile cases where non-residents have received free care to which they are not entitled.</p>
<p>&quot;Hospital beds cost around $1,000 a day - a bill footed by the taxpayer. It is completely outrageous that, while non-residents use these beds free of charge, the very hard-working taxpayers who fund our health system are being sent home to die on waiting lists for chemotherapy, cancer surgery and heart surgery.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just another flaw in a health system that is failing New Zealanders at every turn. The Minister has no other option but to address this loophole immediately. ACT would not allow any non-resident into the country without private health insurance.</p>

<p>&quot;I am calling on Ms King to front up. To pretend she was unaware of this problem is a huge cop-out. It is time she started doing her job - she must ensure that Kiwi patients do not miss out for non-residents looking for a free ride,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
