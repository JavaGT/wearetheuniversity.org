<p>It&#39;s Not Your Money Minister, Pay It Back</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Commerce Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today it was outrageous that Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel believed it was simply &quot;not practical&quot; to pay back the $11.5 million which the Building Industry Authority had accumulated through overcharging.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister has finally replied to the letter I wrote to her four months ago, on behalf of hundreds of building owners who contacted me wanting to know if they would be entitled to get back the money they&#39;d paid to the BIA - in excess of the normal levies&quot;, Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;It has taken two chase-up letters, plus a Parliamentary Question from Hon Richard Prebble, for this Minister to respond. Now she turns around and says, `returning the surpluses to the many thousands of building owners who paid the levy over the past ten years, is not practical&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead, she intends to pass new legislation allowing the BIA - already proved to be dysfunctional - to use these funds, plus interest.</p>
<p>&quot;And if that was not bad enough, it&#39;s clear from the Minister&#39;s letter - attached - that increases in levies are in the wind.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not good enough. I have lodged further Parliamentary Questions asking for the largest single amount owing from the surpluses. I suspect big construction companies will be owed millions.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s their money. They should get it back,&quot; Miss Coddington said.  </p>
