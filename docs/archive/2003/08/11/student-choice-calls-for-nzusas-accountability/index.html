<p>Student Choice Calls for NZUSA&#39;s Accountability</p>
<p>Student Choice (SC) has condemned NZUSA&#39;s involvement in Auckland University &#39;s referendum on voluntary student association membership. NZUSA has invested thousands of dollars paying people to promote compulsory union membership on Auckland&#39;s Campus, in contravention of it&#39;s own constitution.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is,&quot; explains SC spokesperson Glenn Peoples, &quot;NZUSA&#39;s own constitution forbids them from interfering with on-campus politics of individual associations. It&#39;s just a case of them breaking the rules when it hastens their own political goals to do so.&quot; He went further to cite the case as evidence that NZUSA knows that if it were simply left up to students, compulsory membership would be rejected.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to ask what they&#39;re afraid of. Why is it that they feel they have to come in as outsiders and spend all this money? Do they think that students wouldn&#39;t support compulsory membership? If so, why aren&#39;t they content to let students decide their fate? Are they presuming to know better than the people they supposedly represent?&quot;</p>
<p>Peoples called on NZUSA to allow student voices to be heard, instead of pursuing it&#39;s own far left political goals in spite of the student population.</p>
