<p>Farmer fury grows over flatulence tax</p>
<p>National Leader Bill English says the Government has badly underestimated the growing anger of farmers over the ridiculous &#39;flatulence tax&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven&#39;t seen this sort of outcry from farmers since SMPs were abolished in 1985,&quot; says Mr English, who addressed a rally protesting against the tax in Invercargill yesterday.</p>
<p>&quot;A big rally in Hamilton on Friday, a thousand people on the march in Invercargill yesterday - this is real anger,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;The rural sector&#39;s had enough of a government that has cruised on agriculture&#39;s strong performance of the last four years - and repaid it by burdening it with rising costs, taxation and regulation.</p>
<p>&quot;Farmers are already bearing the brunt of many of Labour&#39;s 18 new taxes - and this stupid flatulence tax won&#39;t be the last.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr English told the rally that National would repeal the tax.</p>
<p>&quot;Invercargill MP Mark Peck&#39;s failed attempt to capture the crowd yesterday shows farmers are no longer prepared to pay for Labour&#39;s ideological extravagance.</p>
<p>&quot;And clearly other political parties support this stand, with a show of unity of centre-right parties at the rally, including United Future.</p>
<p>&quot;The anger shown by farmers at these meetings around the country draws a parallel with the rising anger of ratepayers over unnecessary and punitive taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;Our message to farmers is to keep saying no to this ridiculous tax - Helen Clark will buckle.</p>
<p>&quot;Just like Margaret Thatcher&#39;s unpopular Poll Tax - in the end, she buckled,&quot; says Mr English.  </p>
