<p>Where Were You Mr Gallagher?</p>
<p>Friday 22 Aug 2003 Gerry Eckhoff Press Releases -- Rural</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Rural Affairs Spokesman Gerry Eckhoff described this afternoon&#39;s anti-Flatulence Tax protest in Hamilton as a real wake-up call for Prime Minister Helen Clark and the Labour Government.</p>
<p>&quot;Today I witnessed an enormous outpouring of anger. Over 100 vehicles, and an estimated 450 people - including urban Hamiltonians - turned up in protest of the imposition of this methane emissions tax,&quot; Mr Eckhoff said.</p>
<p>&quot;Both rural and urban New Zealand recognise that this ridiculous tax is part of an increasing Labour trend of taxing the wealth creators of this country.</p>
<p>&quot;I was delighted that Hamilton Mayor David Braithwaite and his mayoral colleagues, who make up the Waikato Mayoral Forum, expressed their strong support for the farmers&#39; campaign against this discrimmatory tax.</p>
<p>&quot;My question is: where was Labour&#39;s Martin Gallagher? The Hamilton West MP was conspicuous by his absence. In fact, no Labour MP dared show their face at today&#39;s protest. Their absence makes a mockery of the Government&#39;s promise to consult with farmers.</p>
<p>&quot;I am pleased to report this campaign by the rural community is gaining momentum, despite the Government preferring to look the other way.</p>
<p>&quot;I am flying to the Deep South this afternoon, to support hundreds of farmers attending a protest rally in Invercargill tomorrow, and will be rejoining the ACT bus tour on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark has succeeded in shaking the complacency out of rural New Zealand - it is abundantly clear to everyone that she is on borrowed time,&quot; Mr Eckhoff said.</p>
