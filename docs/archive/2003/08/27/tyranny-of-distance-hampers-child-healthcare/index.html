<p><strong>Wednesday, 27 August 2003, 8:50 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Tyranny of distance hampers child healthcare</p>
<p>The National Party believes the quality of children&#39;s healthcare should not depend on where they live.</p>
<p>National&#39;s Health spokeswoman Dr Lynda Scott is commenting in the wake of a survey released by the Paediatric Society which shows sick children are receiving markedly different care in different parts of the country.</p>
<p>&quot;I congratulate the Paediatric Society for the benchmarking effort but believe it&#39;s a task that should be carried out by the Health Ministry as part of its effort to measure DHB success or failure when caring for kids.</p>
<p>&quot;The society&#39;s annual scientific meeting in Queenstown, has been told that while some boards were dealing with the issues, others are &#39;slipping backwards&#39;,&quot; Dr Scott says</p>
<p>Wairarapa received one of the lowest scores along with Auckland, which failed to fill out a questionnaire. South Canterbury was the lowest ranked of all health boards.</p>
<p>&quot;The gaps are widening, there are increasing differences in the level of healthcare delivered to children depending on where they live.</p>
<p>&quot;Part of the blame&#39;s being laid at the feet of the Government for leaving national policies to be implemented by individual and often isolated Health Boards.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless the Government and District Health Boards label policies a priority, funding is often denied or cut.</p>
<p>&quot;What worries me now is that other children&#39;s healthcare initiatives may fall through the same cracks.</p>
<p>&quot;The alarm&#39;s also been raised about a shortage of experienced paediatric nurses and the number of children being cared for in adult wards.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that Auckland&#39;s District Health Board did not take the time to fill out a questionnaire speaks volumes about the management of healthcare in our largest city,&quot; Dr Scott says.  </p>
