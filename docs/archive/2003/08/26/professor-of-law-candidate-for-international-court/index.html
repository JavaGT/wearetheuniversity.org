<p>VUW Emeritus Professor of Law Candidate for International Court</p>
<p>Today’s announcement of former Dean and Emeritus Professor Sir Kenneth Keith’s candidacy for election to the International Court of Justice is due recognition of his achievements, says Victoria University Professor of International Law, Campbell McLachlan.</p>
<p>Professor McLachlan, Law School Deputy Dean, says he is delighted by the Government’s announcement of its support for the candidature of the Rt Hon Sir Kenneth Keith as a Judge of the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Kenneth&#39;s contribution to the development of International Law is unparalleled in this country. He has worked tirelessly in this field as teacher, counsel and judge on international issues, both in the New Zealand Court of Appeal and in international tribunals. There is no doubt that the work of the International Court of Justice would be immeasurably enhanced by the appointment of Sir Kenneth. In turn, this appointment will also enrich New Zealand’s understanding of the development of International Law at the highest level,” Professor McLachlan says.</p>
<p>Victoria University has a long history of distinguished contribution in the field of International Law, of which Sir Kenneth is an integral part. Other notable academics have included Foundation Professor JW Salmond, who gave his inaugural address on international law in 1906; the late Professor Quentin Quentin-Baxter, a member of the International Law Commission who was described as a &quot;towering figure on the international stage&quot;; and the late Professor Colin Aikman, who made an immense contribution to constitutional development in the South Pacific.</p>

<p>&quot;I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Sir Kenneth&#39;s contribution to Victoria Law School, where he has been Professor of International Law, Dean of the Faculty and is now Emeritus Professor,” Professor McLachlan says.</p>
<p>“Despite the many other demands on his time, he continues to work closely with us to develop and strengthen International Law at Victoria and his inheritance continues to be felt in an active and committed Faculty presence in this field.</p>
<p>“Sir Kenneth’s career illustrates the way in which the development of International Law in a university environment can enhance New Zealand’s global standing and capability.”</p>
