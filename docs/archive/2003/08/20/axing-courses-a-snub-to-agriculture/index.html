<p>Axing courses a snub to agriculture</p>
<p>National&#39;s Agriculture spokesman David Carter says the decision to axe agriculture and horticulture courses for top final-year secondary students is a deliberate snub to agriculture.</p>
<p>&quot;The Education Minister&#39;s reported comments that agriculture is not academically challenging enough is outrageous and shows, once again, how out of touch Labour is with heartland New Zealand.&quot; says Mr Carter.</p>
<p>NZQA has decided to offer agriculture and horticulture at bursary level only for final-year NCEA students, dropping the equivalent subjects from the scholarship list.</p>
<p>&quot;The study of agriculture and horticulture is not only challenging and scientific. It can also provide young people with a profitable future in this country&#39;s leading industry,&quot; says David Carter.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour seems to forget that these students can become the agricultural business leaders of tomorrow.</p>
<p>&quot;Primary production is the backbone of our economy and any move to downgrade its academic recognition will be a major blow to an industry already suffering skill shortages.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government has cruised on the back of agriculture&#39;s strong performance for the past four years.</p>
<p>&quot;It beggars belief that it repays farmers by heaping costly legislation and crippling taxes on them - and now wants to undermine their knowledge base by axing these important agricultural qualifications,&quot; says Mr Carter.</p>
