<p>21 August, 2003<br>Fee maxima fails tertiary sector</p>
<p>Green MP Nandor Tanczos said the Government&#39;s fee maxima system announced today would fail to address student hardship and problems created by an underfunded tertiary education sector.</p>
<p>Nandor, the Green Tertiary Education spokesperson, said the Government has effectively legislated for perpetual fee increases and is pushing too hard for vocational courses.</p>
<p>&quot;While I am glad Minister Steve Maharey has pulled back from the widely-expected massive rise in fees, I am concerned that the Minister has enshrined perpetual fee increases,&quot; said Nandor.</p>
<p>&quot;This will allow institutions to squeeze more money from students every year and I do not share the Minister&#39;s optimism that institutions will limit fee increases to annual inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;A BA degree raised by five per cent over only three years would add an additional $500 to the fees, surpassing the $4000 mark. The negative impact of this is compounded when adding seven per cent student loan interest into the mix,&quot; said Nandor.</p>
<p>Nandor said that liberal educations, such as the BA, are being short-changed in favour of vocational courses.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister&#39;s approach places too much emphasis on vocational courses. While we do need practical skills, the Government&#39;s approach fails to recognise that education plays a wider purpose.</p>
<p>&quot;What New Zealand needs is innovative people with wisdom to back the skills they are taught but we don&#39;t see much wisdom with this Government&#39;s focus.&quot;</p>

<p>Nandor said New Zealand would be better served by investing more money into tertiary education by pulling out of failing overseas sharemarket funds.</p>
<p>&quot;There would be a more sustainable return for the future of New Zealand if we stopped wasting millions of dollars offshore on a fund that followed a $76 million loss with a $47 million loss.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a short-sighted view that sees education as a cost rather than an investment in the future of New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government must realise that the money they pour offshore could be wisely invested back into tertiary institutions so they don&#39;t have to trade off student fees against teaching budgets,&quot; said Nandor.</p>
