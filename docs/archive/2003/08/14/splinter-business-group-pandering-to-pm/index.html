<p>Don Brash National Finance Spokesman</p>
<p>14 August 2003</p>
<p>Splinter business group pandering to PM</p>
<p>National&#39;s Finance spokesman, Don Brash, says the new group attempting to &#39;swell&#39; the Knowledge Wave is just pandering to the Prime Minister after her harsh criticism of this year&#39;s Knowledge Wave Conference.</p>
<p>A splinter group of executive board members is holding a function for business, academic and community leaders in Auckland tonight to discuss taking the Knowledge Wave &#39;to the next level.&#39;</p>
<p>Dr Brash, a member of the Knowledge Wave Trust, says he knows nothing of the group or its plans, despite the fact that the group writes on Knowledge Wave Trust letterhead.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has ignored almost all the recommendations relevant to economic growth from the first and second Knowledge Wave Conferences so this new group appears to be nothing more than a sop to Helen Clark,&quot; says Dr Brash.</p>
<p>&quot;She obviously didn&#39;t like the objective advice she received last time, so wants this group to provide her with something more palatable.</p>
<p>&quot;For a group that is supposed to be non-political and non-ideological, its affiliations with the Progressive Policy Institute and Demos - both well recognised, left-leaning organisations - throws any pretence at impartiality out the window,&quot; says Dr Brash.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark has claimed she wants to promote the country&#39;s development - both economically and socially - yet only six months ago she was rubbishing leading business thinkers, and those invited to tonight&#39;s dinner have been carefully screened to exclude many of the Government&#39;s critics.</p>
<p>&quot;Her Government continues to hamper the country&#39;s economic growth prospects with layer upon layer of anti-business regulation.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand businesses don&#39;t need some group set up to feed the Government selective &#39;good&#39; news. They just want to get on with the job of doing business,&quot; says Dr Brash.</p>
