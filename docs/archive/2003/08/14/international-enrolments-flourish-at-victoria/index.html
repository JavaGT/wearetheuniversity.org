<p><strong>Thursday, 14 August 2003, 12:15 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>International enrolments flourish at Victoria</p>
<p>Victoria University’s international student numbers have increased by 54 percent compared to the same time last year.</p>
<p>At the same time, domestic students have expressed confidence in Victoria by increasing at a rate above the national average.</p>
<p>As at 1 August 2003, 661 more international equivalent fulltime students (EFTS) are studying at Victoria compared to 1 August 2002. This contributes to a record total of 1,885 international EFTS.</p>
<p>For the same period, domestic EFTS have risen 5.3 percent, up from 11,252 to 11,850.</p>
<p>The overall student headcount has grown by 11.66 percent, from 15,637 at 1 August last year to 17,461, representing an overall EFTS increase of 10.3 percent.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon says the rise in international student numbers is in keeping with the University’s strategic international marketing approach and predicted outcomes.</p>
<p>“Our strong international reputation means Victoria’s international student numbers have not been curtailed by SARS, the rising Kiwi dollar and the threat of international terrorism,” he says.</p>
<p>“Victoria prides itself on providing quality education in a supportive environment and we are steadily building on a reputation as the destination of choice among international students.</p>
<p>“These latest enrolment figures are testament to the high-quality academic programmes and pastoral care services we provide to international students in keeping with our early compliance with the Ministry of Education’s Code of Practice.”</p>

<p>Professor McCutcheon says it is equally pleasing to see domestic EFTS increasing above the national average, characterised by static or declining domestic enrolments elsewhere.</p>
<p>“This trend indicates Victoria is an attractive study option for a growing number of New Zealand students in a highly competitive tertiary market. The dynamic atmosphere of our Capital City University is increasingly valued.”</p>
<p>Within defined areas of study at Victoria, EFTS increases are particularly strong within Humanities (up 12.8 percent); and Commerce &amp; Administration, (up 7.3 percent).  </p>
