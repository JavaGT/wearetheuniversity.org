<p>Day Of Reckoning For Labour In Auckland</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters – Speech notes for General Debate</p>
<p>There is a predictable sound coming out of Auckland today.</p>
<p>It is the sound of the chickens coming home to roost . It is not a pleasant sound but it is the day of reckoning.</p>
<p>Someone in this duplicitous gang of political garbage collectors has to stand up and admit to the people that they were wrong.</p>
<p>It is time for the Prime Minister and her cabinet to beat their breasts, from which the milk of human kindness has long since dried, and confess to their political sins.</p>
<p>For ten long years New Zealand First has warned of the dangers of bringing in hundreds of thousands of people from alien cultures and dumping them in New Zealand and particularly in Auckland.</p>
<p>Pensioners are being wrack-rated for the follies of this foolish government.</p>
<p>The government is blaming the Auckland Regional Council for sky rocketing rate rises.</p>
<p>But the blame rests fairly and squarely on the Beehive where Citizen Clark and her cronies work on reconstructing Auckland in the image of Calcutta and Hong Kong. The infrastructure of Auckland is collapsing under the weight of Third World immigrants and students coming here to be exploited by both New Zealanders and their fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>The people of Auckland can blame this government for their transport problems, the decline of their social services and the explosive housing market.</p>
<p>Things are so bad that even the Chinese government is worried about the problems caused by the Asian crime wave hitting Auckland.</p>

<p>See the front page of the Dominion today. Great isn’t it? It’s news to them!</p>
<p>The kidnappings, the killings, the extortion, the prostitution, the drugs and the loan sharks.</p>
<p>All of which Helen Clark and her followers have repeatedly denied.</p>
<p>Police cannot handle the situation. It is out of control.</p>
<p>To be fair, two of the government’s policy changes are working.</p>
<p>Hundreds of new Asian prostitutes are coming to work in the new Asian brothels being set up in this country.</p>
<p>This is Lianne Dalziel’s idea - that immigrants be matched to jobs – jobs created by legalising prostitution.</p>
<p>The Ministers of Immigration and Employment and this feminist Government must be really proud of themselves.</p>
<p>This is their vision of giving Asian women a chance to improve their lives in this great land of opportunity.</p>
<p>Never mind about the crime syndicates, the drug dealers, the pimps and the other riff-raff that hang around this sordid industry.</p>
<p>These enterprising businesspeople are combing New Zealand towns and cities for their brothel sites.</p>
<p>We are on a slippery slope into the Third World and this government is responsible for our decline.</p>
<p>Normal New Zealanders are aghast when they look at the strange people cluttering up the government benches.</p>
<p>Strange people make strange decisions – It is time for a diet of sanity in New Zealand politics and we will force feed it to the doctrinaire weirdos over there!  </p>
