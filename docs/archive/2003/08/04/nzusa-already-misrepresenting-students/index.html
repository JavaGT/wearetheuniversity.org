<p>NZUSA already misrepresenting students</p>
<p>According to Student Choice (SC), the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA) is already failing students as they take the decidedly political stance of condemning free trade with broad strokes.</p>
<p>SC spokesperson Glenn Peoples notes, &quot;NZUSA on the one hand insists on the virtue of compulsory union membership so that it can represent all students, yet on the other hand it disregards the views of the people it represents, and pursues it own political agenda by condemning free trade amongst education providers.&quot; Peoples explained, &quot;since NZUSA is surely aware of the politcal pluralism that exists on campuses throughout the nation, it is clear that they have no problem misrepresenting the views of a large number of its members when it comes to promoting its own left wing agenda.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If NZUSA were given the clear message that students will only join them if they are willing to set personal agendas aside and represent the views and concerns of students,&quot; Peoples said, &quot;they would be in the uncomfortable position of having to listen to members rather than using its members to financially prop up a campaign for its own political ends.&quot; He went on to point out that most students in fact would have an interest n free trade amongst education providers, asking, &quot;Who wants to be told where they should or should not study?&quot;</p>
<p>Student Choice upholds voluntary student association membership for all students, on the grounds of freedom of association.  </p>
