<p>Government wastes legal aid on Algerian case</p>
<p>The Ahmed Zaoui case raises the need to change the Immigration Act regarding whether suspect refugees can appeal a finding against them, especially in the post-September 11 era, says National&#39;s Foreign Affairs spokesperson Dr Wayne Mapp.</p>
<p>&quot;An appeal to the Refugee Status Appeals Authority is a waste of taxpayers&#39; money when the decision is actually made on security grounds,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;The Immigration Act provides for a security risk certificate to be issued. That certificate is subject to review by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Any sensible government would act on the report of the Inspector-General.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no point in a hugely expensive five-week hearing in the Refugee Status Appeals Authority prior to the Inspector-General&#39;s report.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government can&#39;t expect New Zealanders to accept that it is sensible in such circumstances to spend so much money on helping a person who is not even a New Zealand resident.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems absurd that the Government allocates tens of thousands of dollars towards the legal aid process for a person who is suspected of terrorist activities to take a refugee appeal.</p>
<p>&quot;Given that the ultimate decision will be made by the Inspector General of Security, there has been little point in going through a hugely expensive hearing process,&quot; Dr Mapp said.</p>
