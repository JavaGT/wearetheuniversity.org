<p>Jobs Joke of 10 &#39;not so new&#39; programmes</p>
<p>National says New Zealanders won&#39;t be fooled by the Government&#39;s latest bid to &quot;dress up&quot; existing programmes and sell them as new ways to get people into work.</p>
<p>National&#39;s Social Services spokesperson, Katherine Rich, says the Jobs Jolt package is nothing more than Steve Maharey&#39;s attempt to hide the mounting problem of welfare by reheating some old ideas.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister admitted this today in Parliament when he tried to explain it away by saying &quot;little in this package is new...it is an expansion of policies,&quot; says Mrs Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey&#39;s trying to pretend he&#39;s taking a tougher line, when all he&#39;s doing is acknowledging National&#39;s concerns that there are far too many people trapped on welfare.</p>
<p>&quot;Treasury projections show that welfare numbers are going to increase significantly over the next few years.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing is this package is going to allay community concerns that too many people are struggling on welfare,&quot; says Mrs Rich.</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT&#39;S 10 &#39;NOT SO NEW&#39; PROGRAMMES</p>
<p>Funding to develop industry partnerships...&quot; this has been available for years, even under New Zealand Employment Service.&quot; Intensive new services for isolated areas....&quot;case managers have the right (as per legislation) to call in clients for an in-depth interview at any time. Case managers have been in place since the days of Income Support.&quot; Contracted specialists to provide one-on-one...&quot;this is what the contracted services budget is for. It can be used to contract a service or programme for a group or an individual.&quot; Special Assistance for Sole parents ... &quot; this is what replaced the work test for Sole Parents. A Training Incentive Allowance is also available (and has been for years) for sole parents to retrain to return to the workforce. Case managers tailor individual plans for sole parents.&quot; Information Technology Training....&quot; funding has been available for tertiary education for years to Invalids and DPB beneficiaries under the Training Incentive Allowance. For those on the Sickness Benefit and Unemployment Benefit, around $250.00 for work related training courses and free on a TOPS training programme.&quot; Stronger focus on long term...&quot; WINZ has always had a strong focus on long term unemployed (208+ (weeks) on the register). Under this Government there have been several &quot;special drives&quot; to reduce the hard end of the register.&quot; Support for the Mayors Taskforce...&quot; in Dunedin, there has always been a WINZ member on the Mayors Taskforce Core Group. WINZ has provided staff to groups in other cities.&quot; More will be expected.... if refuse to relocate...&quot; WINZ have always had the ability to stop benefits if people chose to live in an area where there were no jobs.&quot; Enhanced management of sickness...&quot; this was being implemented late last year.&quot; Work Testing 55-59...&quot;everyone who receives the Unemployment Benefit is work tested. This age group can apply for an exemption. It&#39;s this option which has been removed.&quot; Steve Maharey says benefit suspension is a better tool than a stand-down sanction - spot the difference - either way you get no money,&quot; says Mrs Rich.  </p>
