<p>Maternal Instinct Reserved For Foreigners</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Health Spokesman Heather Roy today called on Health Minister Annette King to explain why she had not addressed the issue of non-residents having their babies in New Zealand, in light of reports that it had been brought to her attention earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;Around one in 35,000 births in New Zealand is to a non-resident - around 1,300 foreign mothers received free maternity healthcare last year, and their babies are entitled to New Zealand citizenship. Meanwhile, New Zealand patients are missing out,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister has admitted that this problem was brought to her attention in July, but she has done nothing. It is completely unacceptable that she allows non-residents to receive free healthcare while Kiwi patients cannot access the medical treatment they need.</p>
<p>&quot;I am calling on the Minister to urgently address this loophole. Hard-working New Zealand taxpayers fund our health system and, as such, should not have to wait because $1,000 a day hospital beds are being taken up by non-resident mothers and foreign students.</p>
<p>&quot;If Ms King is at a loss as to how to fix this problem, I am happy to offer some free advice. ACT&#39;s solution is extremely simple: non-residents should not be allowed into the country without comprehensive private health insurance - so that New Zealanders are not left paying for a health system they do not get to use,&quot; Mrs Roy said.  </p>
