<p>Housing scheme misses the target</p>
<p>National says the Government&#39;s Kiwibank home loan insurance scheme may help around 1800 New Zealanders buy their first home, but it does nothing for thousands of state house tenants locked into the rental trap.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole point of the Government&#39;s housing policy should be to target those most in need, not those on relatively good incomes who are already well catered for in the mortgage market,&quot; says National&#39;s Housing spokesman Wayne Mapp.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey should be allowing long-term Housing Corporation tenants to buy their houses, move off welfare and move on to the property escalator.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that even those who seem unlikely to ever become homeowners would opt to escape the long-term rental dependency trap,&quot; says Dr Mapp.</p>
<p>&quot;All the Housing Minister&#39;s doing with this scheme is creating more confusion around an already inconsistent housing policy.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s giving 1800 people a chance of home ownership - many who can already afford it in today&#39;s competitive mortgage market.</p>
<p>&quot;But it&#39;s shutting out thousands of low-income earners barred from buying their state house,&quot; says Dr Mapp.  </p>
