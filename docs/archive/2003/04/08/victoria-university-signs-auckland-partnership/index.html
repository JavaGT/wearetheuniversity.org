<p>International students will soon be studying for Victoria University of Wellington pre-University qualifications in Auckland city. An Agreement with Auckland-based Academic Colleges Group, means that Victoria University’s Foundation Studies programme will be taught from 2004 in downtown Auckland.<br>“We expect eventually up to 300 international students beginning their pre-University studies with Victoria University in Auckland, and transferring to Wellington to complete their undergraduate degrees,” said Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stuart McCutcheon.<br>“We are keenly interested in ensuring that our international students meet the highest standards both in terms of English language competency, and also in the areas of independent research and thinking, and study skills. Victoria University’s Foundation Studies programme will provide an innovative and comprehensive introduction to study in the New Zealand tertiary environment, and we expect it to be highly successful in Auckland.”<br>Victoria University of Wellington provides an outstanding learning environment for international students and was one of the first tertiary providers in New Zealand to comply with the Code of Practice for the Pastoral Care of International Students. The Auckland Foundation programme will facilitate the planned growth in the number of international students from the current level of 12 percent of total enrolments to 16 percent of total enrolments.<br>“We are pleased to have forged a partnership with Academic Colleges Group, which has an exceptional international reputation for specialist pre-University learning,” said Professor McCutcheon.<br>Academic Colleges Group already offers pre-University programmes for international students on behalf of two Auckland Universities. Academic Colleges Group also provides learning from pre-school to senior secondary school level, where students take NZQA University Bursary and Cambridge International Examinations.<br>Ian King, Chief Executive of Academic Colleges Group says that he is looking forward to working with Victoria University of Wellington. “While Auckland is often the entry point for international students, it will be a strong marketing position to offer students a broader New Zealand experience as we stair-case them to University study in Wellington,” he said.<br>Websites: <a href="http://www.acg.ac.nz">www.acg.ac.nz</a> <a href="http://www.vuw.ac.nz">www.vuw.ac.nz</a><br>Issued by Victoria University of Wellington Public Affairs<br>For further information please contact <a href="mailto:Jude.Urlich@vuw.ac.nz">Jude.Urlich@vuw.ac.nz</a> or phone +64-4-463 5539 or 029 463 5539  </p>
