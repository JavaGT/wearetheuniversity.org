<p>Palmerston North is a $4.50 steak and cheese pie and Massey is the pastry that holds it together. The city is also seen as a &#39;friendly laid-back family dog&#39; and as a tree, it&#39;s visualised as having flowering parts showing new life and people growing. The research, amongst year 13 and first year tertiary students, is to assess the city&#39;s brand also involves UCOL, Vision Manawatu, Destination Manawatu, the Manawatu Promotional Trust and PNCC.</p>

<p>The campus has a new resident rock star academic. Dr Matthew Bannister found local fame as the guitarist for Dunedin band, Sneaky Feelings, in the &#39;80s. He&#39;s now teaching popular music students in the Department of English and Media Studies. He won&#39;t be giving up his day job but says he&#39;s been inspired by some Palmerston North bands to start thinking about a new book. Events</p>
<p>The campus is winding up for two of the biggest events of 2003. More than 3000 students will take part in the 2003 New Zealand Community Trust University Games over Easter. Events cover more than 30 disciplines, many keenly watched by national selectors. It&#39;s the 101st games and runs from 18-21 April. Destination Manawatu estimates that the Games will bring $30,000 worth of spending to the city, boosted by the RNZ Navy Cruiser Reunion, also being held here in Palmerston North at Easter.</p>
