<p><strong>Monday, 7 April 2003, 6:43 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Helen Clark faces off Student Debt</p>
<p>This week started the Battle to control Student Debt. Helen “Fees Maxima” Clark is battling the “Six Billion Dollar” Student Debt Monster in a series of pre-budget boxing matches. The two have been spotted around the Otago campus area.</p>
<p>The series of bouts between Helen Clark and the Student Debt Monster are raising awareness of Fee Maxima. Fee Maxima is a Government initiative to set maximum levels on tertiary institution fees instead of passing the buck of fee setting onto local tertiary institution councils. The level of Fee Maxima will be set at this year’s budget.</p>
<p>This approach is welcomed by Otago University Students’ Association President Nick Lanham. “It is good to see Labour starting to take responsibility for setting fees, but what we need is the fees to be a maximum of $1000.”</p>
<p>OUSA Campaign Co-ordinator Phil Baskerville added “Setting the fees at a maximum of $1000 would be a first step to getting rid of fees altogether. That is our long term goal, a properly funded Tertiary Sector with no fees and no debt.”</p>
<p>As part of the national day of action, the public bout is on Tuesday 8th April 12.30pm in the Octagon, weather permitting. If it is raining the contest will be held around the Union Hall at the University.  </p>
