<p>More knee-jerk immigration policy</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s latest change in rules for foreign students is another knee-jerk reaction, says National MP Pansy Wong.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has been embarrassed by pictures of students queuing overnight to renew their visas, so after two weeks of pressure their solution is to scrap the same-day visa service.</p>
<p>&quot;Students will now have to hand over their passports and wait for five weeks to renew their visas. It&#39;s clear that spin and damage control is more important to this Government than actually improving the system for foreign students.</p>
<p>&quot;It follows the pattern set many times by this Government, particularly the Minister of Immigration. When a problem emerges they blame the people with the problem, then try and cover it up without actually fixing anything.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s the same tactic used in health, where the Government has re-defined waiting lists in order to cut their numbers.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s no wonder immigration is in such a shambles when all the Minister cares about is avoiding embarrassing pictures and headlines,&quot; said Ms Wong.  </p>
