<p>Cullen Fund gambles on proven loser</p>
<p>The Green Party today warned that the appointment of Frank Russell as an independent advisor to the Cullen Super Fund is another nail in its coffin.</p>
<p>The Guardians of the New Zealand Superannuation Board today announced that the Frank Russell Company would offer a second opinion on investment advice.</p>
<p>However, Green Co-Leader Rod Donald said bringing Frank Russell on board is a case of the dumb hiring the dumber.</p>
<p>&quot;How stupid can you get? Frank Russell&#39;s appalling advice to invest heavily on overseas sharemarkets has already cost the Government Superannuation Fund $328m in the 14 months to December,&quot; said Mr Donald.</p>
<p>&quot;NZ Superannuation Fund chair David Hay ought to know better - he is also a deputy chairman of the Government Superannuation Fund Authority. I would have thought he would have learnt from his mistakes.</p>
<p>&quot;You could get better investment advice from a Turf Digest.</p>
<p>&quot;Frank Russell have a reputation for over-investing in US Stocks. This proved to be a disastrous mistake for GSF and for the Community Trust of Otago, which have also used Frank Russell and have also lost substantial sums on their share portfolios.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Cullen should intervene before Frank Russell tells the fund to take another losing punt on the sharemarket with our money.&quot;</p>
