<p><strong>Wednesday, 16 April 2003, 3:11 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Act Perkbusters Love Perks</p>
<p>New Zealand First has called on ACT to publicly explain its two-faced attitude to perkbusting as MP Deborah Coddington left today for ten weeks overseas study on full pay.</p>
<p>Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters said he was astonished that Ms Coddington had the gall to take taxpayers’ money for private study while her colleague Rodney Hide mounted a campaign against Phillida Bunkle, wrongly claiming she had been paid by a government-funded agency.</p>
<p>Mr Peters said that ACT had double standard over perks.</p>
<p>“If you are an ACT acolyte, the sky is the limit. If you are a solo mother, sick, lame or unemployed and receiving a benefit, ACT believes you should be hounded to the grave.</p>
<p>“Their party believes in the same noblesse oblige principles that sparked the French revolution – except that ACT MPs would be horrified at the suggestion that the poor should eat cake!”</p>
<p>“Ms Coddington has no right to prepare herself for life after politics out of the public purse and she should study at her own expense in preparation for job-hunting in 2005.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters said that to assist the Act MP, he had prepared a form for her to complete.</p>
