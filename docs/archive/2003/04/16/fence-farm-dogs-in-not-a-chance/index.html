<p>David Carter National Agriculture Spokesperson</p>

<p>Fence farm dogs in .... not a chance</p>
<p>National says the Government&#39;s proving, again, it&#39;s out of touch with rural New Zealand if it&#39;s expecting farmers to fence off homesteads to keep farm dogs shut away from visitors. Included in the raft of changes to dog control laws is a bid to have all dogs, other than working dogs, &quot;securely fenced or similarly contained in a portion of their owner&#39;s property, so that visitors have unimpeded access to at least one door.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But there&#39;s no mention in this proposed legislation of farm dogs, the country&#39;s greatest working dog, and the Local Government Minister is making no move to clear up the confusion around what&#39;s classed a &#39;working dog&#39;,&quot; says National&#39;s Agriculture spokesman, David Carter.</p>
<p>&quot;While the Minister&#39;s latest amendments refer to police dogs and those used by government agencies, he obviously doesn&#39;t know that a farm dog is an integral part of a farming business.</p>
<p>&quot;Any farmer will tell you it&#39;s ridiculous to suggest &quot;containing&quot; farm dogs at all times to keep them out of the way of visitors.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not surprising that a Government made up of academics and unionists has little idea how a farm functions, but the issue of working dogs and farm dogs should have been clearly dealt with in the early stages of this legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact it&#39;s been overlooked is just another example of this Government&#39;s, and the Agriculture Minister&#39;s, indifference towards representing the country&#39;s farmers,&quot; says David Carter.</p>
