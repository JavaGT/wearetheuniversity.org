<p><strong>Friday, 11 April 2003, 10:24 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Mallard Must Go</p>
<p>“Political bovver boy Trevor Mallard may have his value as a Prime Ministerial minder but his days as Education Minister must be numbered,” said New Zealand First education spokesperson Brian Donnelly.</p>
<p>“Two new reports show that Mr Mallard has presided over a failing education system where teacher shortages are effecting over 40 percent of secondary schools.</p>
<p>“This is having a devastating effect on our children with the latest literacy figures putting the literacy gap between kiwi boys and girls as worst equal with Iran and Belize.</p>
<p>“This is astounding and totally unacceptable. Mr Mallard has to be held accountable for these appalling results.</p>
<p>“We once led the world in literacy and now fall below Lithuania and rank second worst in the English-speaking world.</p>
<p>“Our secondary schools are overcrowded with over 12,000 foreign fee paying students this year putting enormous pressure on the infrastructure and resources.</p>
<p>“With Maori again over-represented as under-performing students we need to be concentrating the use of our resources on our own students.</p>
<p>“The relationship between the Government and teachers has hit an all time low and we are facing a disaster in our education system that has not been seen before and where the real losers are our children and our economy.</p>
<p>“Mr Mallard must go,” said Mr Donnelly.  </p>
