<p><strong>Monday, 14 April 2003, 9:25 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Full audit of Maori TV projects now needed</p>
<p>The National Party is calling for a full audit of Maori Television projects following reports that show serious questions are being asked about some spending.</p>
<p>&quot;There are too many fingers in too many pies,&quot; says National Party Broadcasting spokeswoman Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>She&#39;s commenting on the recent failures of two production companies and a separate Audit NZ report that raises concerns about the accounting practices of Aroha Films Ltd</p>
<p>Combined the three companies have received over $2.5 million by Government funding agency Te Mangai Paho.</p>
<p>&quot;The Audit NZ report appears to be so damaging that I find it incredible no-one at Te Mangai Paho realised what was going on,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems Te Mangai Paho did know about one of the failing production companies months ahead of its collapse, but didn&#39;t act.</p>
<p>&quot;Now creditors, that include struggling Kiwi actors, are being left out of pocket and in some cases the taxpayer is being asked to pay twice.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s incompetence, sheer incompetence,&quot; Katherine Rich says. &quot;I don&#39;t buy the Te Mangai Paho&#39;s claim that &quot;it has good systems in place to ensure companies receiving funding are viable&quot; when it is clear those systems aren&#39;t working.</p>
<p>&quot;Te Mangai Paho has failed miserably to deliver on its obligation to keep track of how hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money is being spent.</p>
<p>&quot;It would now appear Te Mangai Paho is more concerned with covering up mistakes than making sure our money is being well spent,&quot; says Katherine Rich.  </p>
