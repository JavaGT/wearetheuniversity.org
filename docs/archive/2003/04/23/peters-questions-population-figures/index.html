<p>Peters Questions Population Figures</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters has questioned the accuracy of the claim by Statistics New Zealand that this country’s population will reach four million this week.</p>
<p>The New Zealand First Leader claimed today that the four million figure was probably reached a long time ago because of the number of overstayers here, illegal immigrants and people changing their status after they arrive from overseas.</p>
<p>“The only immigration record kept is a card filled in by the person arriving.</p>
<p>“There is no way of checking the card for accuracy and if the individual later applies for residency, or enrols as a student, the figures are not amended accordingly.</p>
<p>“With thousands of people pouring into the country every month, the figures can become easily distorted and there is no way of correcting them.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters said the lax immigration system meant that no one, least of all the Government, had any real idea about how many people were in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The situation is disgraceful. There is a population explosion of foreigners and the Government is allowing it to happen without mandate and without thought.</p>
<p>“Each time we question the Immigration Minister about the numbers she gives a different set of figures, which proves the situation is out of control.</p>
<p>“Our social, economic and physical infrastructure cannot cope with the population increase, particularly in Auckland, and if immigration is not curbed the problems will become insurmountable.  </p>
