<p><strong>Wednesday, 30 April 2003, 3:30 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Cap fees, not quality say Greens</p>
<p>The Government must ensure its proposed tertiary fee cap includes all post-graduate students if it wants to attract quality researchers, said Green MP Nandor Tanczos.</p>
<p>Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey has announced an $8.6 million project to link tertiary sector researchers with Government policy makers.</p>
<p>Nandor, the Green Party&#39;s Tertiary Education spokesperson, warned that efforts to enhance the benefits of tertiary sector research would be hampered if there were no incentives for students to continue towards post-graduate qualifications.</p>
<p>&quot;While I congratulate the Government for making a positive first step, I am very concerned if post-graduate students are not included in the fee maxima system,&quot; said Nandor.</p>
<p>&quot;This initiative to link the tertiary research sector with Government policy decisions would be wasted without incentives for post-graduate study.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to invest in people to commit to post-graduate studies, where they will contribute to the &quot;critical mass&quot; in research that Mr Maharey is wanting to boost.</p>
<p>&quot;Leaving them out in the cold from protection against soaring student fees is not the way to achieve this.&quot;</p>
<p>Nandor called on Mr Maharey to set an affordable cap on fees for all students at all levels in tertiary education, as a first step to progressively phasing out all student fees entirely.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand&#39;s competitive edge has always been our creativity, innovation and expertise. This is exactly what post-graduate research is about.</p>
<p>&quot;We should be doing everything we can to encourage people to participate in this.&quot;</p>
