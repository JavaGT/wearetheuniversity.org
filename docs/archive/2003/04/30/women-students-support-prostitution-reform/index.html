<p>Women Students Support Prostitution Reform</p>
<p>Women students are expressing their support for the Prostitution Reform Bill, which is due for its third reading this week.</p>
<p>&quot;In our current user pays environment, some women students have turned to sex work to support themselves,&quot; said Camilla Belich, National Women&#39;s Rights Officer. &quot;We support moves to protect those women and all sex workers from exploitation and to uphold their rights - both as humans and as workers.&quot;</p>
<p>Women student representatives feel that if any of their members work in the sex industry, they are entitled to work in a safe environment and be protected from harm.</p>
<p>&quot;The current legislation that allows for prosecution of prostitutes and not clients is prejudiced and sexist. There should be no room for prejudicial and sexist legislation in New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>Belich said many student representatives had come to her with feelings of strong support for the bill, through the Tertiary Women&#39;s Focus Group (TWFG). &quot;We believe that the health and wellbeing of all women is important and urge members of parliament to vote in support of the Prostitution Reform Bill,&quot; said Belich</p>
<p>The Tertiary Women&#39;s Focus Group joins the long list of diverse women&#39;s organisations supporting the Prostitution Reform Bill. These include, YWCA, National Council of Women, Women&#39;s Electoral Lobby, Family Planning Association, Maori Women&#39;s Welfare League, the Catholic Women&#39;s League, the Business and Professional Women&#39;s Association and the National Collective of Independent Women&#39;s Refuges.  </p>
