<p><strong>Thursday, 10 April 2003, 4:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Lower fees equals more teachers in classrooms</p>
<p>Students are calling on the government to address teacher shortages by setting low fees for tertiary education in the upcoming budget.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent statistics of secondary teacher shortages are yet more evidence of the way student debt is wreaking havoc with the New Zealand workforce,&quot; said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>&quot;Government has the perfect opportunity to encourage more teacher trainees and to make it more attractive for them to stay here and teach. For the first time in over a decade, they will be responsible for the levels of tuition fees,&quot; said Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>&quot;Starting teachers arrive in the classroom with a huge debt to pay off and lose ten percent of their income to student loan repayments,&quot; said Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry of Education forecast a sixteen year repayment time for secondary teachers. Is it any wonder that it is hard to fill our classrooms?&quot; said NZUSA Co-President Roz Connelly</p>
<p>&quot;Bonding schemes and scholarships are not enough to address the negative side effects of student loans. Government needs to cure the illness rather than treat the symptoms - cutting fees and paying students allowances will eliminate the need for the unfair loans scheme,&quot; said Connelly.</p>
