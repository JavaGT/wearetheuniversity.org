<p>Community research left out in cold?</p>
<p>Community-based social research continues to miss out on vital funding, despite Government pledges to foster a strong relationship with community groups, said Green MP Sue Bradford.</p>
<p>Social Services Minister Steve Maharey has announced a project to link tertiary sector researchers with policy makers through an $8.6m initiative in this year&#39;s budget.</p>
<p>The Green Party spokesperson for the Community and Voluntary Sector said she welcomed the decision but was dismayed that community based researchers have not, so far been considered.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of this money clearly should be allocated to quality community-based research,&quot; said Ms Bradford.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a much neglected part of the New Zealand social policy landscape even though some of the best quality material overseas comes from research projects run by genuine grassroots organisations.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government talks all the time about the importance of the community sector and a strong relationship between community and Government, so why do they put all this research funding into the tertiary sector?&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Bradford said some of the funding that currently supports an estimated 350 policy analysts at the Ministry of Social Development could be better spent in support of ground-level research.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the best forms of evidence is that which is gained from quality studies or organisational practise on the ground, not the ever-increasing numbers of studies of academic literature.</p>
<p>&quot;We need social policy based on the reality and practice of delivering health, welfare, employment, training, housing and other services in New Zealand - not more and more esoteric and theoretical studies that have little relevance in real life experience.</p>
<p>Ms Bradford asked a supplementary question in Parliament today, which was met by a disappointing response.</p>
<p>&quot;The minister&#39;s response to my question in the house only confirms Mr Maharey&#39;s apparent complete disregard for the potential of community based research to help us address serious social questions in this country.&quot;  </p>
