<p>Media Release</p>
<p>9 September 2003</p>
<p>Co-Management A Form Of Co-Madness</p>
<p>New Zealand First has questioned the Government’s concept of “co-management” of the foreshore and seabed, saying that the issue is in danger of being decided “on the run”.</p>
<p>Maori Affairs spokesperson Bill Gudgeon said that the “co-management” concept seems to have been a knee-jerk response to public rejection of the “public domain” policy put forward so proudly by Helen Clark a few short weeks ago.</p>
<p>“Co-management would be a silly, unworkable system under which nobody would know who owned what and who would be responsible. Such a system would be fraught with difficulties and open to abuse.</p>
<p>“People only have to look at the argument at Port Waikato where competing interests are making life miserable for local residents. This would happen all over New Zealand.”</p>
<p>Mr Gudgeon said the only safe option was that the Crown should own the foreshore and seabed for all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“Everybody would know where they stood and there would be a fair system for sorting out any competing interests.”</p>
