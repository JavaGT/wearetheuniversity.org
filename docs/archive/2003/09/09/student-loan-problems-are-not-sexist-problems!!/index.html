<p><strong>Tuesday, 9 September 2003, 8:32 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Young_Nationals">New Zealand Young Nationals</a></strong></p>
<p>Student Loan Problems Are Not Sexist Problems!!</p>
<p>Female members of Young Nationals are outraged at the claim being lodged by NZUSA Co-President Fleur Fitzsimons on behalf of female students.</p>
<p>“Women have fought long and hard to be treated as equals in education and the workplace. Claims such as these undermine the feminist movements fight for equality,” Northern Regional Chair Gabby O’Brien responds.</p>
<p>“The time it takes to repay a student loan depends entirely on the circumstances a person – male or female – faces when they leave tertiary education. To discriminate on the basis of sex with this claim only reinforces the idea that women are not as capable as men.”</p>
<p>“The claim also fails to recognise men who have taken on what was the traditional role of women in the family and the workplace,” adds Central North Island Chair Tessa Webb.</p>
<p>Young Nationals agree that the student loan scheme means that some professions will find it more difficult to pay off their loans, no profession is entirely gender specific, which underlines the futility of claiming a human rights abuse on the basis of gender.  </p>
