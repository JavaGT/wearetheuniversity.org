<p>Mum’s Initiative To Fight Fatty Fast Foods Gains Support of Expert</p>
<p>A concerned New Zealand mum’s initiative to create a nutritious and convenient styled home cooked meal for kids, as an alternative to fast foods has gained the support of one of New Zealand’s leading experts in obesity.</p>
<p>Professor Jim Mann from the University of Otago’s Departments of Human Nutrition and Medicine said it is important that young children receive a balanced and nutritious diet, and most current fast food meals do not supply this.</p>
<p>“New Zealand mums should be looking at alternatives to the takeaway chains, for the health of their children,” he said.</p>
<p>Professor Jim Mann says the Yummy Tummies range of meals, created by New Zealander Fran Hume contain an essential daily portion of vitamins and minerals, without added preservatives and fats found in so many other convenience foods young New Zealand children are eating today.</p>
<p>“With the current state of child obesity in New Zealand it is encouraging to see initiatives like Yummy Tummies offering a healthier alternative,” he said.</p>
<p>With two young children and a busy corporate lifestyle, Fran Hume of Yummy Tummies identified a lack of fast, convenient, yet well-balanced meal options available for today’s busy parent. What started out from her home kitchen twelve months ago has today grown to an innovative New Zealand business with nationwide distribution, and an export opportunity to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Founder of Yummy Tummies, Fran Hume believes the business is now at the stage where she is only beginning to realise its full potential.</p>
<p>“Today we have nine different meals, each contains three different vegetables and makes up approximately 30% of a child’s recommended daily intake of energy.</p>
<p>All Yummy Tummies ingredients are sourced locally and are available in selected supermarkets nationwide from the end of September. Yummy Tummies also runs a Kids catering service, and a Kids Club with more than 4,000 members under the age of 14 through its website.  </p>
