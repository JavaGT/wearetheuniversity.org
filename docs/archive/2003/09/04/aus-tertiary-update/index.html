<p><img src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE">Vice Chancellors seek action on fees<br>The New Zealand Vice Chancellors’ Committee (NZVCC) has asked Government to convene a working group to consider “a more appropriate escalator for fee maxima” following the recent decision to limit increases in student tuition fees to a maximum of 5% in any year, and within the confines of the fee maxima framework. The NZVCC has described the fee maxima policy as being in tatters with the three-year freeze in tuition fees being turned into a further squeeze on institutions.<br>In addition to limiting tuition fee increases to a maximum of 5%, the Government has reduced the maximum fees for engineering, agriculture, architecture, audiology and specialist large animal science, and has limited the maximum increase in postgraduate tuition fees to $500 in any one year.<br>NZVCC Chair, Dr John Hood, said that the changes had broken previous commitments by the Government and were not in the best interests of students, universities and the wider community. Waikato University Vice-Chancellor, Professor Bryan Gould, said universities were being encouraged to run like businesses but it was a highly rigged market when prices were fixed.<br>Similarly, University of Otago Vice-Chancellor Dr Graeme Fogelberg said his institution would pay a heavy price, having kept fees down, and then being “clobbered” by both the freeze and the fee maxima policy change.<br>The NZVCC has also taken issue with Government’s intention to adjust the fee maxima in future years using the Consumer Price Index, saying that over the last five years the CPI has risen by 9.9% while Statistics New Zealand’s earning and employment survey has recorded a 19.4% increase in average earnings over that period.<br>Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary), Steve Maharey, has said he will raise this issue of indexation of tuition subsidies, but not tuition fees, with the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>Pay equity for university women<br>Achieving pay equity for university women will be the theme of the Association of University Staff Women’s Biennial Conference to be held in Wellington next Thursday. The conference theme is timely given the recent establishment of the Government&#39;s Pay Equity Taskforce which is developing a five year action plan to achieve pay equity in the public sector. That Taskforce is now undertaking a range of relevant research and development projects necessary for finalising the plan.<br>The conference will be opened by Margaret Wilson, Minister of Labour, who will discuss the political agenda for pay equity. Other speakers and workshop presenters include experts in the field from Australia and New Zealand.<br>The conference will deal with pay equity issues within universities and workshops will look at mechanisms to achieve pay equity in the sector. Information from the workshops will inform the Association&#39;s strategy on the issue, to be developed the following day.<br>For further information and/or registrations please contact AUS Policy Analyst, Margaret Ledgerton; <a href="mailto:margaret.ledgerton@aus.ac.nz">margaret.ledgerton@aus.ac.nz</a> or Liz Poole, Women&#39;s Vice-President,<br><a href="mailto:elizabeth.poole@stonebow.otago.ac.nz">elizabeth.poole@stonebow.otago.ac.nz</a></p>

Tertiary Education Commissioner Shona Butterfield said that E-learning needs to move from being the domain of innovators alone, to being embedded in the way an organization works.<br>For further information on the e-Learning Collaborative Development and the Innovation and Development funds, email: <a href="mailto:ecdf@tec.govt.nz">ecdf@tec.govt.nz</a> or <a href="mailto:idf@tec.govt.nz">idf@tec.govt.nz</a></p>

<p>Worldwatch<br>MPs and unions join in top-up fee fight<br>The British Association of University Teachers (AUT) has proposed a motion for next week&#39;s Trade Union Congress annual conference slating the Government&#39;s £3,000-a-year tuition fees plan. Even though the Prime Minister has said university lecturers stand to gain big salary rises if the fees are brought in, the teachers came out against the policy with all guns blazing. Last night, ministers were privately predicting that the charges would bite the dust in the first stage of a massive Labour backlash against Mr Blair&#39;s &quot;presidential&quot; leadership style.<br>Education secretary Charles Clarke has begun a campaign, however, to persuade Labour MPs to support university top-up fees by declaring that there was &quot;no alternative&quot; to higher charges for students. He told the Association of Commonwealth Universities meeting in Belfast this week that the days when higher education could be funded entirely from the public purse were gone. He said plans to allow universities to charge up to £3,000 a year from 2006 were &quot;actually rather conservative&quot; by international standards.</p>
<p>Saudi to allow foreign private universities<br>Saudi Arabia&#39;s Ministry of Higher Education has announced plans to allow foreign universities to establish a presence in the kingdom for the first time.<br>Khaled al-Angari, Saudi Arabia&#39;s minister of higher education, told a news conference last week that foreign investment in the private higher-education sector was open and the opening of foreign universities in Saudi Arabia would be welcomed.<br>Saudi Arabia has one of the world&#39;s fastest growing populations and only nine universities for a country of 23 million people. According to the Ministry of Higher Education, Saudi colleges and universities have almost reached their capacity. Saudi universities accepted 178,500 first year students this year.</p>
<p>Nepalese students burn exam papers<br>Students in Nepal set fire to test papers and buildings this week to halt examinations in a protest against King Gyanendra&#39;s dissolution of the government last year.</p>
