<p>Nick Smith National Environment Spokesperson</p>
<p>16 September 2003</p>
<p>Taxpayers shell out nearly $500,000 on hui</p>
<p>The National Party has today released figures showing the Government is spending nearly $500,000 on hui for its foreshore and seabed plan.</p>
<p>&quot;This half-a-million dollars is further feeding the grievance gravy train and would not have been necessary if the Government had stuck to its commitment of Crown ownership,&quot; says National&#39;s Environment spokesperson, Nick Smith.</p>
<p>Dr Smith says the expenditure is &quot;taxpayer-funded sophistry because the proposals are so woolly, nobody understands what is meant.</p>
<p>&quot;After just a handful of the 11 hui, Helen Clark&#39;s resolve is melting away.</p>
<p>&quot;First she promised legislation to clarify Crown ownership of our foreshore and seabed, but since then she&#39;s been retreating further and further up the beach.</p>
<p>&quot;Answers to parliamentary questions show the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet has been allocated $369,314 for the overall consultation process.</p>
<p>&quot;Approximately $225,000 is being spent to hold the hui (11 hui at average cost of $20,000 per hui) and $25,000 has been set aside for processing and analysing the submissions.</p>
<p>&quot;Te Puni Kokiri has been given a further $116,000 for its involvement. $76,000 of that is for support, travel and accommodation related to the eleven hui,&quot; says Dr Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;This expenditure is all about solving Labour&#39;s political problems, rather than developing a proper legal framework for administering our thousands of kilometres of coast and millions of hectares of sea.</p>
<p>&quot;It speaks volumes that Labour is spending half a million dollars on consultation with iwi, yet no amount has been set aside for consultation with the remaining 85% of New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand needs &#39;more doey and less hui&#39; on this issue. National would legislate for continued public ownership in the name of the Crown,&quot; says Dr Smith.</p>
