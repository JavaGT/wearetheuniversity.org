<p>Let Parents Choose, Minister</p>
<p>Monday 22 Sep 2003 Deborah Coddington Press Releases -- Education</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today said she was not surprised that Education Minister Trevor Mallard&#39;s review of Wainuiomata schools last year failed to find any improvement in education standards for the area, in light of a recent ERO report.</p>
<p>&quot;This massive, ongoing review of New Zealand schools is an exercise driven by the bean-counters. Mr Mallard has been totally captured by his officials. Throughout the country, teachers, principals, children and their parents are living in trepidation waiting for the axe to fall on their schools,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been visiting these communities and talking to parents. Last week I was in Waikato. This week I&#39;m in Russell. A Board member of a 60-pupil school - which is financially sound and delivering quality education - told me their school will be `reviewed&#39; in two years. These poor people are wondering what they can do in the coming 24 months to save their school.</p>
<p>&quot;If something isn&#39;t broken, you don&#39;t try and fix it. We should be celebrating these schools, with their strong community and parental support, not crushing them.</p>
<p>&quot;This ERO report showed that schools are focussed on financial reporting, to the expense of teaching children literacy and numeracy skills. This is not new - a 1999 UNESCO study showed that New Zealand principals spend more of their time tied down with paper work than any of their overseas counterparts.</p>

<p>&quot;ACT&#39;s education policy closely follows the Swedish and Dutch system of `Letting Parents Choose&#39;. Funding follows the child. This means schools - large, small or in-between - can remain open and free from heavy-handed Government intervention - provided they are delivering a quality education, are financially sound, and parents are satisfied,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
