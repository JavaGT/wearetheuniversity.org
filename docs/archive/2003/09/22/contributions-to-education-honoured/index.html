<p>Contributions To Education Honoured</p>
<p>WELLINGTON –A group of outstanding educationalists, teachers, principals and school administrators were today honoured by the country’s largest education union.</p>
<p>The awards were presented by the country’s largest education union, NZEI Te Riu Roa, which has 42,000 members. It represents teachers and principals in primary schools, teachers in early childhood education centres, support staff in primary and secondary schools, special education staff in primary and secondary schools and advisers in the tertiary sector.</p>
<p>They were presented by Bruce Adin, NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, at the opening of the union’s 120th Annual Meeting in Wellington.</p>
<p>Sixteen members of the union were honoured along with three distinguished members of the education community.</p>
<p>Bruce Kelly, a former principal of Karori Normal School, and former NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, was given the union’s highest honour, Life Membership.</p>
<p>Bruce Kelly has played a huge role in raising the professional status of teachers during his time as National President of NZEI Te Riu Roa, from 1975-76, and as a National Executive Member in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s.</p>
<p>“He is a visionary who fought to enhance the professional status of primary teachers for many years. We have seen his ideas culminate in the establishment of the New Zealand Teachers Council,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Bruce Adin.</p>
<p>Dr Jocelyn Jesson, the director of research development at the Auckland College of Education, Iritana Tawhiwhirangi, the former Chief Executive of the Kohanga Reo Trust, and Professor Timoti Karetu, a former Maori Language Commissioner, were made Honorary Fellows of NZEI Te Riu Roa.</p>
<p>Dr Jocelyn Jesson is a highly regarded academic who taught in secondary schools from 1969 to 1988 before moving into the tertiary sector and becoming a leading education researcher.</p>
<p>Iritana Tawhiwhirangi began her work as educator 55 years ago, as a primary teacher. She began work at the Department of Maori Affairs in 1963 where she helped develop Tu Tangata, the Stand Tall, Maori development policy. This was the vehicle for funding the kohanga reo movement, which Iritana helped create. In May this year she retired as chief executive of the Kohanga Reo National Trust.</p>
<p>Professor Timoti Karetu began his career as a secondary school teacher and went on to establish the Maori Studies Department at Waikato University. He was also the first Maori Langage Commissioner and has written more than 50 books and other publications in Maori and on the teaching of Te Reo Maori.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Patara, a former National President, and Frances Nelson, a member of the National Executive, were made Fellows of NZEI Te Riu Roa.</p>
