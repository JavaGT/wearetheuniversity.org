<p><strong>Monday, 22 September 2003, 2:33 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Nick Smith MP National Party Environment Spokesman</p>
<p>22 September 2003</p>
<p>Govt must fix RMA rather than pick favourites</p>
<p>&quot;The Government should fix the Resource Management Act for all rather than create sweetheart projects of Jim Anderton&#39;s choosing,&quot; says National&#39;s Environment spokesman Nick Smith.</p>
<p>He&#39;s commenting on suggestions that Cabinet will consider a new process in the next month, which would give Jim Anderton the ability to by-pass the RMA for infrastructure projects the Government deems worthy.</p>
<p>&quot;A process of resource consents that has a Minister dishing out favours is wide open to abuse and corruption. The bureaucracy of the Resource Management Act needs to be fixed for all businesses both large and small - not just a select few.</p>
<p>&quot;Jim Anderton&#39;s track record in picking favourites is less than impressive - just look at the spectacular failure of Sovereign Yachts in Auckland.</p>
<p>&quot;He promised that New Zealand would benefit to the tune of $600 million in export earnings, while Helen Clark said the Sovereign Yachts project is like &#39;a dream come true&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Both of them were wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;Then there&#39;s the example of Helen Clark&#39;s close friend Dr Ross Armstrong who was attempting to fast-track infrastructural projects during behind closed doors meetings with Michael Cullen.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Armstrong lost his job as allegations of a perceived conflict of interest swirled around the Government.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark&#39;s Government has a history of working with, rewarding and protecting those who it deems are friendly. It punishes those who it disagrees with.</p>

<p>&quot;The only positive in this announcement is the Government is at last acknowledging that the Resource Management Act has serious problems. It also makes a mockery of claims by Marian Hobbs that the RMA does not need changing.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government would do well to go back and pick up the sensible RMA reforms introduced to Parliament by Simon Upton in 1999, but rejected by Labour in 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;National believes the Government should be taking an even hand to the Resource Management Act and fixing the process to make it easier for everyone, rather than a few chosen favourites,&quot; says Dr Smith.</p>

<p>Jim Anderton&#39;s Track Record</p>
