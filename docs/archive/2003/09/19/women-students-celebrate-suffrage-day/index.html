<p>Women Students Celebrate Suffrage Day and Continue to Fight for Change</p>
<p>Women students around New Zealand will be pushing the pay equity message today, dressed in late 19th century costume to celebrate 110 years of women&#39;s suffrage.</p>
<p>&quot;Suffrage Day is a wonderful day to pay homage to our world leading suffragettes and to continue the work of New Zealand&#39;s suffragettes through pushing for the equitable society they always envisaged,&quot; said Camilla Belich, National Women&#39;s Rights Officer for the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>&quot;If Kate Sheppard was around today she wouldn&#39;t be sitting around thinking how marvellous it is that we have a female Prime Minister - she would be actively trying to address the residual inequities women continue to face in New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Women in New Zealand, on average, still only earn 84% of the average earnings of a man and take on average twice as long to repay their student loans -110 years and we still haven&#39;t got it right,&quot; said Belich. &quot;We also support the campaign being launched today by the New Zealand Nurses&#39; Organisation for more pay for this crucial and largely female workforce.&quot;</p>
<p>Auckland University women will be attending classes in late 19th century costume and distributing pay equity information in the Auckland University Quad from 10am-12noon. Costumed Wellington students will be spreading the pay equity message at 12:30 in the Victoria University Quad. Similar activities will take place in Hamilton, and in Dunedin there will be a Reclaim the Night March, organised by a coalition of women&#39;s groups.  </p>
