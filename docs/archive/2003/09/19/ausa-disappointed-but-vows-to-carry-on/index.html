<p><strong>Friday, 19 September 2003, 8:59 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_Students_Association">Auckland University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>AUSA disappointed but vows to carry on</p>
<p>AUSA president Scott Kelly said &quot;Obviously I am disappointed with the result&quot; of the Compulsory/ Non compulsory student membership referendum announced today.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not just disappointing for me but should be disappointing to all students whose representation is been gradually eroded as a result of non compulsory membership&quot;</p>
<p>He went on to say &quot;The recent decision by the University to increase fees significantly, and in some cases past the fees maxima, shows the need for a strong, representative student voice.&quot;</p>
<p>AUSA president-elect Kate Sutton said &quot;Voluntary membership brings with it distinct challenges but AUSA as a body will continue to champion the rights of students as it has since its formation in 1891&quot;  </p>
