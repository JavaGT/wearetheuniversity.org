<p>Government Policies Hurt Exporters</p>
<p>New Zealand First says exporters are being hurt by the pressure created by Government policies of using high immigration numbers to lift economic growth through increased consumption.</p>
<p>Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters said interest rates in New Zealand were high by international comparisons and the Reserve Bank was keeping them up because of the explosive housing market – particularly in Auckland.</p>
<p>“The pressure on housing is due mainly to the huge population increase caused by hundreds of thousands of immigrants pouring into the area over the past four years.</p>
<p>“The Government foolishly embarked on this policy to push up economic growth without thinking of the downstream effects such as pressure on housing and other social, economic and physical infrastructure.</p>
<p>“The result of all this is that the creators of the country’s wealth, the exporters, are being hurt by a high New Zealand dollar which is affecting their returns and their ability to compete on international markets.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters warned that the situation could not continue because increasing exports held the key to economic growth in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Our social services are gradually slipping into Third World status and the trend will continue unless the Government stops importing people and introduces plans to increase exports - in short production, not consumption.”</p>
