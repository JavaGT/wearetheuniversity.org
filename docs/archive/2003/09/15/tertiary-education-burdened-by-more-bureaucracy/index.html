<p><strong>Monday, 15 September 2003, 8:02 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Tertiary education burdened by more bureaucracy</p>
<p>National Party Tertiary Education spokesman Simon Power says the Labour Government has failed to curb massive growth in the size of the bureaucracy within tertiary education.</p>
<p>The National Party is releasing figures from parliamentary questions today that show spending on tertiary education administration has climbed by 33.3% since 2001, while Student Component funding has only risen by 7.1%.</p>
<p>&quot;These answers make Steve Maharey&#39;s claim that &#39;we are committed to a steadily rising tide of funding&#39; look far from convincing.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey&#39;s pledged public support for the knowledge economy and says he wants to increase New Zealand&#39;s skills base, but that doesn&#39;t match-up with his decision to invest in bureaucrats rather than our tertiary institutions and students.</p>
<p>&quot;In light of the figures provided by Mr Maharey, the Government just looks mean, preferring to spend its money on the bureaucracy rather than on students.</p>
<p>&quot;Fee maxima have kept Tertiary Education Institutions tied to minimal fee increases and meagre funding student component funding increases.</p>
<p>&quot;Meanwhile, the bureaucrats have been raking it in,&quot; Mr Power says.</p>
<p>&quot;Tertiary institutions and students have every reason to be angry. Fee maxima and the Student Support Review has given neither of these groups hope of increased funding,&quot; he says.  </p>
