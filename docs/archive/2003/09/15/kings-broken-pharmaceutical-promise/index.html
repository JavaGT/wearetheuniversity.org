<p>King&#39;s Broken Pharmaceutical Promise</p>
<p>Monday 15 Sep 2003 Heather Roy Press Releases -- Health</p>
<p>Health Minister Annette King will not deliver on her Budget promise to lower the cost of prescription medicines, from $15-$3 per prescription on October 1, for the country&#39;s poorest patients - those enrolled in access PHOs, ACT New Zealand Health Spokesman Heather Roy said today.</p>
<p>&quot;In the last Budget, Ms King announced that these patients - as well as those under 18 years old, enrolled in PHOs - would pay a maximum of $3 for each prescription from October 1, 2003,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is evidence that the timetable for the pharmacy computer system changes, required to facilitate the Minister&#39;s plan, is hitting serious problems. Clearly, no timeline or decisions have actually been made about completion of this project - despite the Minister&#39;s earlier assurance.</p>
<p>&quot;When asked in Parliament if the October 1 implementation was still on track, Ms King avoided the question, saying `in the near future I will take to Cabinet a package of measures that includes the co-payment area ... and I will announce a decision of that in the near future&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Answers to my Parliamentary Questions - seeking confirmation that her promise, to tens of thousands of New Zealanders, will not be broken - are due in two days. Having caught the Minister out in reneging on her Budget promise, I would now not be surprised if she were to make a damage control announcement soon.</p>

<p>&quot;Patients should not hold their breath - contrary to the Minister&#39;s promise, cheaper pharmaceuticals are not two weeks away. PHOs will be left holding the baby on October 1. It will again be doctors and nurses at the coalface - not the Minister - who will have to break the news to irate patients expecting savings,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
