<p>NATIONAL PARTY REHEATING FAILED EDUCATION POLICIES</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s education paper is disappointing. The party is simply reheating its old policies and lifting ideas that have been tried overseas and failed,&quot; says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President Bruce Adin.</p>
<p>NZEI is the country&#39;s largest education union representing 42,000 members who work as early childhood teachers, primary teachers and principals, and support staff and special education workers in primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>&quot;The National party&#39;s policy of national testing for primary students is based on the system they have in England. It does not help English children to learn and it won&#39;t help our children if it is introduced here,&quot; says Bruce Adin.</p>
<p>&quot;In England teaching has been reduced to preparing their students for national tests so that schools get good scores and a high position on the school league tables.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This has placed the teachers and the students in an educational straight jacket that restricts the teachers&#39; ability to teach and the children&#39;s ability to learn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As a result England has ended up with a very narrow curriculum, as the message has been, if its not tested don&#39;t teach it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s heavy handed approach to truancy is also disappointing as it simply seeks to punish the parents rather than addressing the causes of truancy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Having schools involved in the prosecution of parents who&#39;s children are truant, and docking the benefits of the parents, will do nothing to solve the problem.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In many cases primary schools are the last social agency in a neighbourhood that parents trust and the parents who have children who are likely to be truant are the ones who are the most difficult to reach at present.</p>
<p>&quot;All that the National policy would do is drive a wedge between the school and the parents by being heavy handed. I doubt that it would make any difference to attendance levels and it does nothing to address the causes of truancy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would have thought that the National Party after two election defeats would have had a good look at their policies and thought they needed to go in a new direction, because the community has given them a pretty clear message, but these education policies show they have failed to do that,&quot; says Bruce Adin</p>
