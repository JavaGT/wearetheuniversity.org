<p>Hon Bill English MP National Party Leader</p>
<p>03 September 2003</p>
<p>One way traffic in beaches debate</p>
<p>National Party Leader Bill English is warning mainstream New Zealanders that their views are at risk of being drowned out in the din being generated by activists over the Government&#39;s beaches and seabed proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;If Kiwis don&#39;t speak out loud and clear, the Government&#39;s confusing position of &#39;no-one owns the beach&#39; could face further erosion.</p>
<p>Mr English is commenting on threats of beach occupations and civil disobedience by Maori claiming ownership of the foreshore from Wellington to the Rangitikei River.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour must listen to mainstream New Zealanders and take account of the thousands upon thousands who&#39;ve signed petitions supporting Crown title to the beaches and seabed,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s unfortunate there&#39;ve been suggestions of media bans at the taxpayer-sponsored hui and even now there are still questions over radio and television&#39;s ability to report the &#39;consultation&#39; meetings.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is showing its contempt for the opinions of the vast majority of New Zealanders who will not attend the marae talks,&quot; Mr English says.</p>
<p>&quot;The media, the public&#39;s only means of getting balanced information from those meetings, is facing censorship.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Party has also been fielding calls from members of the public searching for more information about the Government plan, after earlier being told by Michael Cullen&#39;s office that no paperwork was available.</p>
<p>&quot;This issue is too important to be locked away from public scrutiny,&quot; Mr English says.</p>
