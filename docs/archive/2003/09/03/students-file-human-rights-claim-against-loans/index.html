<p>Students file historic human rights claim against loans</p>
<p>A group of women students are filing a claim that the student loans scheme breaches the Human Rights Act at the Human Rights Commission today.</p>
<p>&quot;The student loan scheme is grossly discriminatory against women,&quot; said Camilla Belich, National Women&#39;s Rights Officer for the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA). &quot;Because of our lower lifetime earnings, we take twice as long as men on average to repay our student loans and pay nearly 20% more for a bachelors degree because of interest payments.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Women are paying more than men for the same qualifications,&quot; said Belich. &quot;By making a claim against student loans under the Human Rights Act, we are seeking to prove that the student loan scheme is not only unfair but it also breaches human rights.&quot;</p>
<p>A group of women student leaders from tertiary institutions will be personally delivering the claim to the Human Rights Commission in Wellington today.</p>
<p>&quot;This claim is going forward under the name of NZUSA Co-President Fleur Fitzsimons,&quot; said Belich. &quot;But we are taking the claim on behalf of all women who are disadvantaged by the loans scheme - whether they be nurses, teachers, hairdressers or doing any other paid or unpaid work.&quot;</p>
<p>Women student leaders will be delivering the claim in academic dress at 1.45pm this afternoon at the Human Rights Commission on Aitken Street.  </p>
