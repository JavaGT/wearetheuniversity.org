<p>Mercury Energy and Waikato University announce 40th anniversary scholarships</p>
<p>Mercury Energy and Waikato University have launched a scholarship programme to celebrate the University’s 40th Anniversary in 2004.</p>
<p>The scholarships will be available to every Year 13 student who achieves an A or B Bursary in the 2003 exams and enrols in a full-time bachelor degree at Waikato University in 2004. A Bursary students will receive scholarships worth $3,000 and B Bursary students will receive scholarships worth $2,000.</p>
<p>“It’s a great way to celebrate our 40th anniversary by making a University education even more accessible to the young people of our region,” says Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould.</p>
<p>“Making tertiary education accessible to students in the Waikato and Central North Island was our original reason for existing, so the scholarships are certainly in keeping with our founding spirit.”</p>
<p>However, the scholarships will also be available to students in the rest of the country.</p>
<p>“The scholarships still reward excellence, in that they depend on a good Bursary grade, but are not so elitist or confined to one region that they favour just a few,” says Professor Gould.</p>
<p>The scholarships can count towards fees or halls of residence costs and can be taken in conjunction with other scholarships.</p>
<p>Mercury Energy Sales and Marketing Manager Ian Moody says promoting the scholarships with Waikato University strengthens the company’s ongoing commitment to families and young people in the community.</p>

<p>“This is a wonderful opportunity for young students to continue with further education, and Mercury Energy is pleased to be able to contribute towards their future success,” he says.</p>
<p>“We are extremely grateful to Mercury Energy for its support of the scholarships initiative. It’s an excellent example of the type of constructive partnership we and the business sector are involved in,” says Professor Gould.  </p>
