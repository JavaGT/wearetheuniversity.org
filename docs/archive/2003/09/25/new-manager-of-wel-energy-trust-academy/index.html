<p>The new manager of the WEL Energy Trust Academy of Performing Arts at Waikato University, Jeremy Bell, has a strong background in developing drama studies at the university and in community theatre in Hamilton.</p>
<p>Jeremy has been on staff at Waikato for 13 years after time as a professional theatre director in London, including stints at the Young Vic and the Royal Shakespeare Company.</p>
<p>He was the university’s first lecturer in drama studies who had a practical background in professional theatre and he helped develop Waikato’s drama teaching programme.</p>
<p>At the same time, he has been actively involved in directing theatre at Hamilton’s Compact Theatre.</p>
<p>From the mid-1990s, he was also involved in developing the concept of the Performing Arts Academy as a top-class facility for the arts in Hamilton.</p>
<p>“Hamilton’s really lucky to have this great venue and I want to see the Academy filled with arts activities and events 24 hours a day if possible,” says Jeremy.  </p>
