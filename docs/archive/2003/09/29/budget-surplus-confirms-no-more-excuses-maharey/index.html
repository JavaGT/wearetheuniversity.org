<p>Budget surplus confirms: no more excuses for Maharey.</p>
<p>&quot;The recent announcement of an extra $1.5 billion dollars Budget surplus over and above a forecast $4.1b means there is now absolutely no excuse for not implementing a universal student allowance scheme.&quot;</p>
<p>Says Lincoln University Students&#39; Association president Andrew Kirton. A universal student allowance equivalent to the unemployment benefit would cost approximately $1 billion dollars annually, according to the government&#39;s recent Student Support Review document.</p>
<p>Steve Maharey, Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) has recently told students that the policy is unaffordable.</p>
<p>&quot;Maharey continues to patronise students with hollow promises and feeble excuses, while behind the scenes treasury is accumulating these huge piles of cash - where are their priorities?&quot; Kirton said.</p>
<p>The unexpected and additional $1.5b surplus alone could have financed an allowance for every tertiary student this year. Currently only 1/3 of students receive some sort of allowance.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the facts are getting harder for the Minister to ignore: only 1/3 of students receive an allowance, students are still the only group in society that must borrow to meet their cost of living and student debt continues to grow at over $40,000 every hour. Students are angry and want action now.&quot; Kirton said.  </p>
