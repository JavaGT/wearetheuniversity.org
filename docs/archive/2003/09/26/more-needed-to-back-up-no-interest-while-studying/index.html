<p>More needed to back up no interest while studying</p>
<p>Students have welcomed the government announcement that $240 million in interest charges on student loans has been written off and are calling on the government to take further steps to make the loan scheme fairer.</p>
<p>&quot;The no interest on student loans policy was a good start, but students and graduates are waiting for further changes to make the loans scheme fairer and address the one of the key drivers of high student debt - lack of access to living allowances,&quot; said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s only fair that current students do not pay market interest rates to the government,&quot; said Fitzsimons. &quot;But if more students had access to living allowances, there would not have been such huge amounts borrowed and less interest for government to write off.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has now been in government for four years and student debt has doubled in that time. A living allowance for all students is well overdue and would ensure that students do not have to borrow from the loan scheme to pay for basics like food and accommodation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Interest write offs were a good first move for Labour in 1999 but the Government has had four years to back this policy up with further improvements,&quot; said Fitzsimons. &quot;How long do students and their families have to wait for increased access to allowances?&#39;</p>
