<p>“The seminars will be addressing issues concerning matters of key national importance,” says the School of Law’s dean Scott Davidson. “We hope the seminars will provide an important forum for exchanging and developing ideas for the future.”</p>

<p>Issues to be covered include international trends in terms of resource claims and indigenous ownership issues, as well as how future electricity sector developments should be controlled and managed.</p>
<p>Speakers and panel members in Hamilton include Margaret Wilson, David Caygill, chief legal advisor for the Ministry of Economic Development Roger Palairet, Victoria University law lecturer Andrew Erueti, Waikato University law professor Barry Barton and Waikato University lecturer Craig Coxhead.</p>
<p>The Wellington seminar on 7 October at Te Papa beinning at 5.15pm will again focus on Maori claims to petroleum resources. It will feature Margaret Wilson, Andrew Erueti and Craig Coxhead, as well as Calgary law professor Nigel Bankes, and Roger Perkins, policy director at the Ministry of Economic Development, whose responsibilities include resource management.</p>
<p>The Auckland seminar on 9 October at Bell Gully in Shortland St beginning at 5.15pm will again look at the electricity sector and feature David Caygill, Roger Palairet and Barry Barton, as well as Anita Rønne, a professor of energy law from Copenhagen University.</p>
