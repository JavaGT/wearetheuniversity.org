<p>David Carter National Agriculture Spokesman</p>
<p>12 September 2003</p>
<p>Govt pulls plug on greenhouse gas research</p>
<p>National&#39;s Agriculture spokesman David Carter is slamming a Government decision to cut funding for a greenhouse gas emissions research project at Lincoln University.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes no sense.</p>
<p>&#39;We&#39;ve got the Government forcing farmers to stump up for greenhouse gas research through the absurd &#39;flatulence tax&#39;, yet on the other hand it&#39;s pulling the plug on research,&quot; says Mr Carter.</p>
<p>He is commenting on reports that a million-dollar research project at Lincoln has not only had its application for new funding turned down, but it has also had its existing government funding stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;This is despite the private sector already doing its bit to substantially subsidise the project,&quot; says Mr Carter.</p>
<p>&quot;This research project had huge potential for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and increasing agricultural efficiency. It&#39;s tipped to cut nitrate leaching and slash nitrous oxide emissions by as much as 80%.</p>
<p>&quot;Farmers know only too well the Government&#39;s determination to levy for research into greenhouse gas emissions - they call it a &#39;fart tax&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;But what they won&#39;t understand is why the Government sees fit to axe already-established, essential research into the problem. It makes no sense, &quot;says Mr Carter.</p>
<p>&quot;Agriculture is the engine room of our economy. And it is research, like the Lincoln University project, that will fuel its future.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a real slap in the face for agriculture that the Government can find $34 million for an America&#39;s Cup challenge, but can&#39;t find research funding for an industry that earns 67% of our total exports,&quot; says Mr Carter.</p>
