<p><strong>Friday, 12 September 2003, 11:42 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Attack on Dr Newman &#39;disgraceful distraction&#39;</p>
<p>National Party Welfare spokeswoman Katherine Rich is accusing Tariana Turia of a disgraceful distraction and says she should &#39;play the ball not the person.&#39;</p>
<p>She&#39;s responding to a &#39;childish and pathetic&#39; attack by the Associate Minister in charge of Child Youth and Family on ACT&#39;s Dr Muriel Newman.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of concentrating on the appalling unallocated case list, social worker recruitment and retention problems, Mrs Turia has unleashed a stream of abuse,&quot; says Mrs Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;She should be focussing on rising notifications and CYF&#39;s growing difficulty in protecting the nation&#39;s most vulnerable children - instead she&#39;s accused Dr Newman of using them as &#39;pawns&#39; in a political game.</p>
<p>&quot;Our children are our future and they deserve a Minister that concentrates on the real issues instead of infantile name-calling.</p>
<p>&quot;And it is Dr Newman to you Mrs Turia... not Muriel,&quot; Mrs Rich says.</p>
<p>&quot;She has a Batchelor of Science in Mathematics and a Doctorate in Maths Education, not to mention the 20 years she spent working in both secondary and tertiary education both here and in the US.</p>
<p>&quot;She deserves to be recognised for her achievements,&quot; says Mrs Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;Feminists in the Labour Party will cringe at Mrs Turia using the despicable technique of trying to diminish Dr Newman&#39;s standing by referring to her by her christian name.</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs Turia is achieving absolutely nothing by spending her days taking cheap shots at the valid concerns being raised by Dr Newman,&quot; Mrs Rich says.  </p>
