<p>Prostitution Bill Opposition Increasing</p>
<p>MP’s conscience vote on Tim Barnett’s private members bill to decriminalise prostitution has almost spilt parliament evenly.</p>
<p>The bill passed its second reading tonight by the smallest of margins with 62 votes in favour and 56 against.</p>
<p>Tonight’s vote shows that many MPs have had second thoughts on the bill. At the first reading 87 MPs voted for the bill to proceed to select committee, 25 MPs have since decided that this bill is not good law and joined the opposition against it.</p>
<p>Maxim Institute says that a groundswell of public opposition is just beginning to build as people come to realise the effects of the proposed law change.</p>
<p>At the heart of concern in opposition to the bill are the disastrous social consequences that will follow.</p>
<p>Evidence from Australia shows that under decriminalisation the sex trade will expand, child prostitution will worsen and trafficking women for prostitution will increase.</p>
<p>The bill will normalise prostitution by removing offences of soliciting, pimping, brothel keeping and living off the earnings of a prostitute.</p>
<p>MPs in every party have received thousands of letters asking them to vote against the bill. Many MP’s have received more letters on this issue than any other.</p>
<p>As awareness and opposition continues to increase Maxim expects that the bill will ultimately be defeated.  </p>
