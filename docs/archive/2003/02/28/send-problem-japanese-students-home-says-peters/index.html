<p><strong>Friday, 28 February 2003, 12:47 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Send Problem Japanese Students Home Says Peters</p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters wants the Government to close a school for problem Japanese youths in West Auckland and to deport those connected with it.</p>
<p>This follows the appearance in court of the director of the school for allegedly attempting to pervert the course of justice following the death of a Japanese student.</p>
<p>Nine students from the academy have been charged with the assault and kidnapping of the dead student.</p>
<p>Mr Peters said it was astonishing that such a school would be allowed in New Zealand when this country already had a “superabundance” of home grown problem teenagers.</p>
<p>“The Japanese government would certainly not welcome a plane load of Mongrel mob prospects from New Zealand so why should we import their social problems?</p>
<p>“The authorities should take a long hard look at this school and any others like it with a view to closing them down and sending those involved with them back to where they came from.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters said it was a sorry state of affairs when some individuals seemed to think that importing social problems from Asia was a good way to grow the New Zealand economy.  </p>
