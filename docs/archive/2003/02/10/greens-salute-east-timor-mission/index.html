<p>Greens salute East Timor mission</p>
<p>The Green Party has joined with the nation in congratulating our Defence Force on the successful completion of its East Timor mission.</p>
<p>&quot;The spirit and professionalism of our service personnel has helped a devastated, new nation find the breathing space to cement its independence,&quot; Green Foreign Affairs Spokesperson, Keith Locke said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The East Timor experience is yet more proof that peacekeeping is what this country does best.</p>
<p>&quot;It is ironic that the Government has been at pains to praise and identify itself with the East Timor mission, while at the same time casting a shameful blanket over the activities of the SAS contingent it contributed to America&#39;s war in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&quot;On the one hand we have hugely successful, much publicised contribution to the stability of a regional neighbour. On the other, we were drawn into a secret, violent foray into a far-flung corner of Asia in which innocent people died.</p>
<p>&quot;Of the two paths there can be no doubt of the one in which New Zealanders take the most pride,&quot; said Keith Locke.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greens congratulate the thousands of New Zealanders who have contributed to peacekeeping in East Timor and are still doing so in other countries around the world.&quot;</p>
