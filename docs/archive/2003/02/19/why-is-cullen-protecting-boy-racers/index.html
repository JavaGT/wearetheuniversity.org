<p>Why is Cullen protecting boy racers?</p>
<p>Despite widespread concern over the behaviour of boy racers, Michael Cullen continues to give a stay of execution to these louts, according to National Party MP Brian Connell.</p>
<p>&quot;When I first sought leave of the House to debate this legislation as a matter of urgency, it was number 30 on the order paper.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of Dr Cullen&#39;s clear disinterest, it has now dropped to number 35,&quot; Mr Connell says.</p>
<p>&quot;And it has been delayed to allow us to speed through such dazzling acts as the Radio New Zealand Amendment Bill,&quot; says Mr Connell.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps Dr Cullen knows something the rest of the country doesn&#39;t, but I have not heard widespread community outrage over the activities of Radio New Zealand!</p>
<p>&quot;Michael Cullen&#39;s displaying an arrogant disregard for the concerns of tens of thousands of New Zealanders who want to feel safe and secure, both in their houses and on the roads.</p>
<p>&quot;He has totally misread the public pulse on this issue.</p>
<p>&quot;I have had a deluge of public complaints from people who want this legislation passed as a matter of urgency,&quot; Mr Connell says.</p>
