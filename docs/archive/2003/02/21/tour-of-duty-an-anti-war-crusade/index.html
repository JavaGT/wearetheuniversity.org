<p>21 February, 2003<br>Tour of duty an anti-war crusade</p>
<p>It is time for students to get active and challenge the system, said Green MP Metiria Turei who launches a nationwide tour of tertiary campuses on Monday.</p>
<p>The Education spokesperson will visit at least 11 campuses over two weeks to coincide with Orientation celebrations as students begin the new tertiary year.</p>
<p>In addition to addressing issues in tertiary education, Metiria will deliver a strong anti-war message and encourage students to engage and challenge the future direction of our country.</p>
<p>&quot;The younger generation are being written off as complacent, or lacking the fire that led to the massive anti-Vietnam and Springbok campaigns,&quot; said Metiria. &quot;That&#39;s bollocks. Excessive fees and meagre allowances are being used to distract us and we must resist that.</p>
<p>&quot;The Prime Minister has dismissed last week&#39;s protests as small because they weren&#39;t as big as the Vietnam and Springbok protests. We utterly reject that typically condescending arrogance.</p>
<p>&quot;No more ancient slogans and chants. Let&#39;s get creative with our message, let&#39;s throw out the traditional rules of protest and spark the fire.&quot;</p>
<p>Metiria said she will be meeting with Student Association Executives, Maori and Women&#39;s student groups, as well as local greens.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an excellent opportunity to meet with some of the people who will emerge as leaders. I am looking forward to discussing particular issues, such as Te Tiriti and &#39;user pays&#39;, as they relate to education.&quot;</p>
<p>The Orientation tour begins Monday, February 24 and concludes on Thursday, March 6.</p>
