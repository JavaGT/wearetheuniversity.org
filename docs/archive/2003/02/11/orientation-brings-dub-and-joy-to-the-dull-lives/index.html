<p>On Tuesday 25th V presents Hip Hop Day, with P-Money, Ill Semantics, break dancing demonstrations and Graffiti by Disruptiv Ltd.</p>
<p>The Tui Challenge also begins on the 25th. Brave students form teams of four and compete in an assortment of quests from the spicy to the muddy to win over $1500 worth of prizes. One part of the competition is the Vesbar’s Quiz Night, starting at 7pm.</p>
<p>Deep house DJ Soane is playing from 12pm in the Wellesley St Quad on Wednesday the 26th, presented by Microsoft.
