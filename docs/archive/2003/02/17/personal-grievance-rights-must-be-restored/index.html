<p>Personal Grievance Rights Must be Restored</p>
<p>The Council of Trade Unions is calling for the restoration of personal grievance rights after the release of a report showing a pro-employer trend in decisions in the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>The independent report by Professor Gordon Anderson of the Victoria University Faculty of Law, which was commissioned by the CTU, was released today.</p>
<p>The Anderson Report traces the erosion of an objective approach in a number of Court of Appeal decisions to the increasingly subjective employer-based standard which limits the ability of the Court to review an employer decision.</p>
<p>“It seems that some rather basic principles of fairness have gone out of the window in our highest appeal court,” CTU president Ross Wilson said.</p>
<p>“It is unthinkable that the Court would be responding to the sustained employer campaign on employment law, but it is difficult not to see a coincidence of events.”</p>
<p>To rub salt into the workers’ wound the Court of Appeal has also suppressed compensation awards to workers who get past the new restrictive tests for challenging their dismissal.</p>
<p>Evidence in support of this view is provided in the 20 Employment Tribunal and Authority cases reviewed recently in a substantial paper to the Employment Law Institute by Chief Judge Goddard which he concluded revealed ‘a pattern of extremely low awards’.</p>
<p>“It is 30 years since personal grievance rights were introduced to replace strike action by fellow workers of the grievant,” said Ross Wilson.</p>
<p>“A job is of economic, social, and personal importance to individual workers. The law should be fair and the remedies realistic. The Report confirms the law is neither.”</p>
<p>The Anderson Report can be found on the CTU website <a href="www.union.org.nz">www.union.org.nz</a>.  </p>
