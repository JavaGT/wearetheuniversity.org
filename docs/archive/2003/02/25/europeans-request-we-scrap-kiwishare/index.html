<p><strong>Tuesday, 25 February 2003, 5:25 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Europeans &#39;request&#39; we scrap kiwishare</p>
<p>The European Commission has asked New Zealand to scrap kiwishare provisions and allow unrestricted overseas access to our land, energy resources and businesses, Green Co-leader Rod Donald said today.</p>
<p>The top-secret EC requests to New Zealand under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) has been revealed on a Canadian website: <a href="http://www.polarisinstitute.org">www.polarisinstitute.org</a></p>
<p>&quot;No wonder the Government has wanted to keep the lid on the so-called &#39;requests&#39; that are being made of New Zealand,&quot; Rod Donald said. &quot;This document confirms that our sovereignty is just another poker chip in the high-stakes GATS game being played out behind closed doors.&quot;</p>
<p>The specific EC requests to New Zealand would:</p>
<p>* Allow foreign firms and individuals unrestricted access to New Zealand property and businesses by scrapping by the Overseas Investment Commission; * Remove the Kiwishare ownership and directorship restrictions on Telecom; * Allow overseas firms unrestricted access to wholesale energy supply; * Open up ownership and control of our water supplies and environmental services such as refuse disposal to international firms.</p>
<p>&quot;Take one example,&quot; said Rod Donald. &quot;The EC asks us to allow full &#39;market access&#39; to our refuse disposal services, effectively dooming Canterbury&#39;s single landfill.</p>
<p>&quot;The joint venture between local government and two private companies would be GATS-illegal under the market access rules as it restricts the size of the market. Potentially, Canterbury could be covered by dozens of foreign owned-and-operated landfills.</p>

<p>&quot;And this is just the request from the European Commission. We can only guess at what &#39;requests&#39; the United States has made - and guessing about such important issues is something the public should not have to do.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an outrage that the people of New Zealand have to find out this information from a Canadian website and that they find it out just three days before public submissions on GATS requests are closed,&quot; said Rod Donald. &quot;We call on the Government to finally come clean on exactly what other countries want us to give up, so that the long-overdue public debate can finally begin.&quot;</p>
