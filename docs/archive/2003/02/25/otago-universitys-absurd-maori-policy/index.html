<p>Otago University&#39;s Absurd Maori Policy</p>
<p>New Zealand First has described Otago University’s new Maori language policy as absurd political correctness and nothing to do with education.</p>
<p>The new policy means that students can write assessments in the Maori language this year to encourage the use of Maori in its written and oral form.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters said today the policy was ridiculous and that any student interested in gaining internationally recognised qualifications would ignore it.</p>
<p>“Te reo Maori is an integral part of Maori culture and should be preserved as such. It is the language of New Zealand’s cultural heritage – not the language of an academic institution, unless the subject being studied relates to Maori.</p>
<p>“It might come as a surprise to the politically correct activists at Otago that pre-European Maori did not have language to cover such subjects as nuclear physics, biochemistry and calculus.</p>
<p>“They were also unaware of company law, the Peloponnesian wars and Russian history.</p>
<p>“The policy is clearly absurd and a waste of both time and money. It is difficult to understand how a university with such a great reputation can get caught up in this cultural claptrap,” said Mr Peters.  </p>
