<p>Student loan interest still above market rates</p>
<p>Student loan interest rates released today for 2003/4 are still higher than some commercial interest rates for home loans, say the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>&quot;Seven percent interest on student loans is nothing for government to brag about,&quot; said NZUSA Co-President Roz Connelly. &quot;A quick look on the Bank of New Zealand website shows mortgage interest rates of 5.99% - a full 1% lower than what the Government is charging its own citizens for getting an education.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cullen and Maharey&#39;s promises of a review into student loan policy are little comfort for graduates who see that their repayments are barely covering interest,&quot; said Connelly. &quot;Student loan borrowers are cynical about whether government cares about them when private businesses are offering their clients more favourable terms. &quot;</p>
<p>The components of the interest rate have also changed for the worse, with the inflation adjustment rising from 1.9% to 2.8%. This means that borrowers who are not earning will see their loan rise by nearly 1% more this year than last year.</p>
<p>The effects of the student loan scheme are far wider than individual loan balances at IRD, student loans have perverse social consequences as well. &quot;Student loans are clearly a factor in our declining birth rates,&quot; said NZUSA Co-President Fleur Fitzsimons. &quot;It&#39;s no wonder that graduates are putting off having babies, when they&#39;re punished with nearly 3% a year interest on their loans when they take time out of the workforce to have and care for children.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Interest on loans is bad for our economy and our society,&quot; said Fitzsimons. &quot;The government cut interest for current student but continues to punish graduates in the workforce and those raising the next generation. We don&#39;t need more reviews. We need a fairer education system and increased funding.&quot;</p>
