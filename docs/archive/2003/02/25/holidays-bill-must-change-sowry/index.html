<p><strong>Tuesday, 25 February 2003, 3:30 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Roger Sowry National Industrial Relations Spokesman</p>
<p>25 February 2003</p>
<p>Holidays Bill must change - Sowry</p>
<p>The National Party&#39;s promising to take no vacation from its opposition to the Holidays Bill after its first reading in Parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;The life-blood of the New Zealand economy, small business, can not afford to have thousands of dollars worth of extra labour costs lumped on them at this time,&quot; according to National&#39;s Industrial Relations spokesman Roger Sowry.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to make it clear this is not an attack on workers.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Party wants to make sure workers aren&#39;t forced into the permanent holiday called redundancy - which could be the reality of the extra expense.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s estimated the Bill&#39;s public holiday provision changes could add 1% to annual wage costs for the average business.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s more than $7,000 extra for a medium-sized enterprise employing 20 people.</p>
<p>&quot;With the international slow-down starting to take its toll, the Labour Government should be working with business to help cut costs not increase them.</p>
<p>&quot;Add to that forecast increases in energy costs, the rising dollar, the economic impact of ratifying the Kyoto protocol, as well as hikes in OSH compliance costs and ACC levies - and a grim picture starts to develop.</p>
<p>&quot;Business will also be forced to carry an extra burden for Maori consultation, as the Government&#39;s agenda of creeping political correctness is applied,&quot; says Mr Sowry.</p>
<p>&quot;Some estimates suggest compliance costs will climb by nearly $44,000 this year - that&#39;s more than the average wage or one less person the average business could employ.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re talking about the engine room of New Zealand&#39;s economy, not the Trade Unions despite what Helen Clark might be telling the Australians,&quot; says Mr Sowry.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s anti-business slant is now reaching epidemic proportions and that&#39;s why the National Party will be pushing for the Holidays Bill to be overhauled at select committee,&quot; he says.</p>
