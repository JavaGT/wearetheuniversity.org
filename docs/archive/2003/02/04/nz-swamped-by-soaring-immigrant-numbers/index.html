<p>NZ Swamped By Soaring Immigrant Numbers</p>
<p>New Zealand First says immigration figures released today show there was an explosion in the number of migrants arriving here on a permanent basis last year.</p>
<p>The figures showed a net increase of 38,200 in permanent and long term arrivals compared to 9,700 the previous year – an increase of 400 percent.</p>
<p>Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters said 42,100 New Zealanders left the country while 70,500 foreigners arrived and he claimed this was the real immigration figure for the year.</p>
<p>“This is almost as many as Australia, which is a ridiculous level for a country the size of New Zealand.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters said that New Zealand could not sustain such high levels of immigration and parts of the country, particularly Auckland were suffering from serious infrastructure problems.</p>
<p>“This year we are nearly 400 secondary teachers short, mainly due to increased immigration and demands from the foreign student education industry.</p>
<p>“House prices in Auckland have soared, the health system is buckling and interest rates have been kept high because of the economic pressures of uncontrolled immigration.”</p>
<p>“It proves that the Government has a crude policy of repopulating New Zealand. In many cases we are losing talented young Kiwis and replacing them with people who will contribute little to this country.</p>
<p>“It is time to stop this invasion before it is too late,” said Mr Peters. “The future of New Zealand is at stake.”  </p>
