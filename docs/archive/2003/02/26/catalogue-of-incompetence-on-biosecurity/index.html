<p>Catalogue of incompetence on biosecurity</p>
<p>The discovery of a black widow spider in an imported truck in Invercargill was bad enough - but the difficulty encountered trying to report the find to MAF was even worse, says National&#39;s Biosecurity spokesman, Shane Ardern.</p>
<p>&quot;This incident is a huge warning to our biosecurity. The fact that the worried owner of the imported truck could only report his find to a MAF answer machine is not good enough.</p>
<p>&quot;To make matters worse, when he finally made contact with MAF, he was told to freeze the spider and egg sacs found in the truck and send them to a laboratory at Lincoln.</p>
<p>&quot;This is hardly an encouragement to people to respond to biosecurity breaches,&quot; says Mr Ardern.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite millions of dollars being spent on attempts to eradicate the Painted Apple Moth and the Varroa Bee Mite, lessons have clearly not been learnt.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ardern says containers and imported vehicles should be fumigated at their port of entry because any breach poses a threat to our primary industries and native forests, and to New Zealanders&#39; health.</p>
<p>&quot;Cost should not be allowed to become the issue. Last week, Treasury released figures which showed an outbreak of foot and mouth could cost New Zealand more than 10-billion dollars, yet still nothing is being done to make our biosecurity borders safe,&quot; says Mr Ardern.</p>
