<p><strong>Monday, 10 November 2003, 9:16 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>NZQA spending blow-out on travel &amp; accommodation</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English has released figures that show staff at the NZQA have been spending large amounts of taxpayer money on travel and accommodation under Trevor Mallard&#39;s stewardship.</p>
<p>Mr English is commenting on answers provided to written Parliamentary questions that show $50,000 is now being spent on a &#39;Business Redesign Project ... with a view to defining the Qualifications Authority&#39;s core business&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;By supporting an NZQA deficit that grew to $3.78 million in the 2002/2003 year, the Education Minister&#39;s allowing vital education dollars to be swallowed up by an operation that no longer knows what its &#39;core business&#39; is.</p>
<p>&quot;Meanwhile, spending on staff accommodation and travel has gone through the roof,&quot; says Mr English</p>
<p>&quot;It is another example of a burgeoning bureaucracy under Labour. The Government believes it knows better than anyone else how to run schools and universities. The taxpayer&#39;s footing the bill for its mistakes,&quot; says Mr English</p>
<p>Answers to written Parliamentary questions show the bill for staff accommodation went up from $52,877 in 1999/2000 to $148, 816 in 2000/2001. It grew again in 2001/2002 to $174, 019 and again in 2002/2003 to $302,277.</p>
<p>&quot;The NZQA&#39;s staff accommodation budget has grown nearly six-fold, while NZQA staff travel is now costing the taxpayer 340% more,&quot; Mr English says.</p>
<p>The written answers reveal the cost of staff travel has risen from $166,506 in 1999/2000 to $533,905 in 2000/2001 $562,113 in 2001/2002 and $567,454 in 2002/2003.</p>

<p>Mr English says the NZQA has been the target of teacher frustration over the NCEA and it has been plagued by questions about spending under Labour.</p>
<p>In 2000 the Authority was condemned for paying out $580,000 in bonuses to staff, including $2000 to each staff member for hard work and the &#39;stresses and strains&#39; of shifting offices.</p>
<p>Last year National revealed the number of NZQA staff being paid more than $120,000 a year jumped from none to 10, permanent staff numbers grew by 80% and the bill for consultants more than tripled.  </p>
