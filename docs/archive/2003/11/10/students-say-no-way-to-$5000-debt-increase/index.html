<p><strong>Monday, 10 November 2003, 10:28 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Students say &quot; NO WAY To $5000 debt increase</p>
<p>Otago University students are protesting against the possibility that their fees may go up by 5% for next year. They are meeting at 1.45pm today (Tuesday Nov 11th) on the Union Lawn; to attend a rally before marching on the Otago University Council meeting at 2.15pm in the Registry Building.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re going to the meeting to have our say, to tell the Council that they cannot inflict fee increases on students,&quot; said Catherine May, Otago University Student&#39;s Association Campaigns Coordinator. &quot;We&#39;ve calculated that a 5% increase in fees will equate to an increase in the average student debt of $5000 over the course of their study and repayment period.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; It&#39;s just not good enough. The Council has to stop seeing students as cash cows, and acknowledge us as a key stakeholder in the University,&quot; said Catherine May.</p>
<p>Students will be presenting a 3000-signature petition demanding that the Council not raise fees for next year, and the students at the meeting will do whatever they consider necessary to get the message across to the Council that they will not tolerate increases in their fees and consequently their debt.  </p>
