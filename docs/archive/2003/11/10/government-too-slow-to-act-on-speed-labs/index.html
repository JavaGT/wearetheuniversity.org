<p>Tony Ryall National Police Spokesman</p>
<p>10 November 2003</p>
<p>Government too slow to act on speed labs</p>
<p>A two-year backlog in methamphetamine lab testing is further proof this Government completely ignored early warning signs of the &#39;P&#39; epidemic, says National&#39;s Police spokesman Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;The Police Minister has turned a blind eye to the problem of &#39;P&#39;. He refused to see that a burgeoning clan lab industry, under the control of the gangs, would lead to the single biggest policing crisis in years,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;Now he&#39;s panicking and he doesn&#39;t know what to do. He&#39;s come up with a couple of specialist police teams who won&#39;t even start work until next year.</p>
<p>&quot;Under Labour, crime is more random and more violent - yet the Prime Minister says the streets are safer.</p>
<p>&quot;It is little wonder that the Police Association is frustrated that drug-makers are out on bail, reportedly reoffending, while scientists struggle to catch up with speed lab testing,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;Counties Manukau, for example, is in the grip of a drug-related crime wave with more and more police being sent in to cope with a spate of homicides. Senior police there have admitted that under-staffing is causing the police to miss investigating alleged drug-dealers,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government&#39;s been caught completely off-guard. For the last three years, National&#39;s been warning that &#39;P&#39; use is out of control, but all George Hawkins has done is focus on endless money for highway patrols and speed cameras.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at the Proceeds of Crime Act. He&#39;s refused to act on this, leaving the drug-dealing gangs raking in millions and thumbing their noses at the law.</p>
<p>&quot;This soft-on-drugs Government can&#39;t afford to ignore the &#39;P&#39; problem any longer.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Hawkins must listen to the police frustrated at his inaction, he must listen to the under-resourced scientists and firefighters struggling to deal with clan labs and he must listen to the thousands of ordinary New Zealanders trying to curb the spread of this insidious drug,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
