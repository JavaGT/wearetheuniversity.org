<p>Mallard Passes The Buck</p>
<p>Tuesday 25 Nov 2003 Deborah Coddington Press Releases -- Education</p>
<p>Secondary school students face uncertainty and upheaval next year with reports that principals are struggling to provide teachers with four non-teaching hours a week - a requirement of the latest collective contract for teachers, ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;This mess exposes the complete failure of the centralised negotiation system supported by the PPTA and an out-of-touch Minister,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;It has crippled the education sector. ACT&#39;s solution would be to introduce devolved funding and allow schools and communities the flexibility to employ more teachers to reduce stress and workload,</p>
<p>&quot;Education Minister Trevor Mallard has created this situation. The introduction of the NCEA - and its increased focus on internal assessment - has created greater workload pressures for teachers. The PPTA stipulated non-contact time in its agreement with the Minister - partly in response to this increased workload.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard had one eye on the upcoming general election when he agreed to the PPTA&#39;s demands. The teachers dispute had dragged on for 14 months and had become a major source of embarrassment for Labour.</p>
<p>&quot;Principal Brent Lewis was right when he said the non-contact agreement was a `hospital pass for schools&#39;. The Minister decided it was more important to win the election and let schools pick up the pieces later,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
