<p>Open Lecture: Japan in Transition – from Monocultural to Multicultural Society</p>
<p>Associate Professor Ritsuko Miyamoto of Akita University’s Faculty of Education and Human study, will give a public lecture at AUT tomorrow on the transformation of Japanese society from the 19th Century until the present day.</p>
<p>In the 19th Century, the Japanese were led to believe by their leaders that from the standpoint of ethnicity, nationality, citizenship and race they were one, and that the word &quot;Japanese&quot; most concisely described them in all these four categories.</p>
<p>“The Japanese overrode virtually all diversity, negated all internal pluralism, during the Meiji era – 1868-1912 – in order to unite the nation under the flag of the rising sun. The use of local dialect was banned in school. The absurd myth of the middle-class consciousness – the notion that all Japanese share the same tastes and predilections –was invented and foisted on a believing public,” says Professor Miyamoto. The Japanese were given a single racial, national, ethnic and civic identity and they accepted it gladly in exchange for the source of pride, namely a strong nation that could stand shoulder to shoulder with the developed West.</p>
<p>Consequently, the indigenous Ainu people, who had lived in northern part of Japan for a long time, were forced to abandon their own language and cultural heritage.</p>
<p>“The huge influx of foreign labour to Japan (due largely to Japan’s aging workforce) is forcing the country to accept that it has to be a nation of diverse traditions, cultural backgrounds and lifestyles.”</p>

<p>During her lecture Professor Miyamoto will illustrate the change in Japanese society in terms of cultural diversity, by talking about women&#39;s roles, minority peoples (Ainu and Korean descendants), and a new flow of immigrants from neighbouring countries.</p>
