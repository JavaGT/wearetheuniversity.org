<p>Students pay the price for a cheap political deal</p>
<p>&quot;High school students are now beginning to pay the price for the Labour Government&#39;s cheap political deal to end the teachers strike before the last election,&quot; says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>He&#39;s responding to concerns from secondary principals who say senior students will be left unsupervised or sent home early as schools struggle to meet non-contact clauses in the collective contract for teachers.</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard signed a deal with the teachers that is stealing education from our kids,&quot; Mr English says.</p>
<p>&quot;He agreed to less time in the classroom for teachers but failed to give schools more money or any more staff to fill the holes. &quot;Mr Mallard must have known that schools would need to either raise more funds from parents, or cut teaching time to honour the deal that he and the unions agreed to.</p>
<p>&quot;There could also be worse to come,&quot; warns Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Teachers are already in union meetings to settle their strategy for the next pay round.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand teachers will be looking to lift the non-contact time by at least another hour a week, on top of the extra that schools are now struggling with. &quot;Teachers are the meat in this sandwich.</p>
<p>&quot;They need non-contact time away from their students, but the Minister can&#39;t leave schools selling raffle tickets to put teachers in front of classrooms,&quot; says Mr English.  </p>
