<p>Some early scientific visitors to New Zealand: public lecture by AUT’s newest honorary doctor</p>
<p>Ever wondered who named the Dieffenbachia or why the Haast Pass is so called?</p>
<p>The answers to these and many more questions will be revealed at a public lecture given by Dr Gary J Tee, Auckland University of Technology’s most recent Honorary Doctorate recipient.</p>
<p>Accompanying Captain Cook on his 1769-1770 voyage, Banks and Solander were the first scientific visitors to New Zealand. They recorded, described and collected much of what they saw of this country’s unique flora and fauna.</p>
<p>On their return to England the news created great interest in scientific circles. The prospect of recording and collecting as yet undiscovered specimens encouraged many eminent scientists to follow on subsequent voyages to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Charles Darwin was one of the many who visited, some of whom came for brief visits while others worked here for extended periods.</p>
<p>Others who visited included Johann &amp; Georg Forster, Ivan Simonov, James<br>Clark Ross, Baron von Huegel, Allan Cunningham, Paul<br>Edmond de Strzelecki, Ernst Dieffenbach, Joseph Dalton Hooker, Thomas<br>Henry Huxley, James Dwight Dana, Ferdinand von Hochstetter, Julius<br>Haast and Franz Reuleaux.</p>
<p>Dr Garry J Tee was awarded an honorary doctorate at AUT’s spring graduation ceremony on 17 October. He is a research fellow at the University of Auckland’s Department of Mathematics. His research areas include numerical analysis and the history of science.</p>
<p>All media are welcome to attend this public lecture in lecture theatre WS101, Science and Engineering Faculty, AUT Wellesley Street campus on Tuesday 11 November at 12pm.  </p>
