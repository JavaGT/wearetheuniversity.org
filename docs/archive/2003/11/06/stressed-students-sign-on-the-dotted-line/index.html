<p>Media Release</p>
<p>Thursday Nov 6th 2003</p>
<p>Stressed students sign on the dotted line</p>
<p>Despite exams being in full swing, the Otago University Student&#39;s Association petition has gained 2500 signatures demanding that the University of Otago Not increase fees for next year.</p>
<p>&quot;Response to the petition has been very positive, &quot; said Catherine May, OUSA Campaigns Coordinator, &quot;The aim is 3000 or more, and we would be delighted if members of the wider Dunedin community signed as well, as we believe that fees increases and the accompanying issue of student debt affect New Zealand across the board &quot; &quot;We want the University Council to acknowledge the anger Otago Students feel as they face the prospect of higher fees, larger debts and they still have to borrow to pay for their weet-bix,&quot; said Mr. Nick Lanham, OUSA President.</p>
<p>OUSA has also released a virtual copy of the petition on it&#39;s website, for people who haven&#39;t been able to sign a copy in real life. This can be accessed through OUSA&#39;s website at <a href="http://www.ousa.org.nz">www.ousa.org.nz</a>.</p>
<p>The petition will be presented to Council as part of a day of action on Nov 11th.</p>
