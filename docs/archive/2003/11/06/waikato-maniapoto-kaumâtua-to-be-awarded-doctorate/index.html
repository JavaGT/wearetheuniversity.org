<p>Waikato-Maniapoto kaumâtua to be awarded honorary doctorate</p>
<p>Senior Waikato-Maniapoto kaumâtua Tui Adams is to be awarded an honorary doctorate from Waikato University at a ceremony on 4 December.</p>
<p>“Tui Adams is a leading exponent of Mâori lore and history and, as such, is regarded as a living taonga (treasure), not only by his own people but also amongst the staff of Waikato University,” says Waikato’s pro vice-chancellor (Mâori) Tamati Reedy.</p>
<p>Tui Adams has been associated with Waikato University’s School of Law since 1990, providing the school and the university’s research unit Te Matahauariki with invaluable advice on Tainui tikanga (custom) and tikanga generally. He has represented the university widely at numerous functions, seminars, lectures, conferences, powhiri and graduation ceremonies and has an extensive record of public service outside of the university as well.</p>
<p>“Tui is recognized nationally for his expertise in mâtauranga Tainui, the knowledge systems of Waikato, Maniapoto, Hauraki and Raukawa, as well as many other iwi within the university’s catchment area,” says Professor Reedy. “He has demonstrated his strong intellectual capacity through the ancient art of whaikôrero (oratory), enhanced by his knowledge of tikanga and traditions.</p>
<p>“Tui’s command of te reo Mâori is excellent and provides an inspiring model for younger people keen to master the finer points of oratory and the subtle nuances of language. He is one of the principal speakers for the Mâori queen Te Arikinui, Dame Te Atairangikaahu, a role which recognizes his standing as a Tainui historian.”</p>
<p>The award ceremony will be held at 1pm on Thursday 4 December at Whare Tapere Iti, the WEL Energy Academy of Performing Arts. The powhiri will begin at noon.</p>
