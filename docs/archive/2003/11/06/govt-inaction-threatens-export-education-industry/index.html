<p><strong>Thursday, 6 November 2003, 8:32 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Govt inaction threatens export education industry</p>
<p>The Chinese Government&#39;s demand for a list of approved private education insitutions here proves the Education Minister&#39;s &quot;bridge-building&quot; trip to Beijing was just a PR stunt, says National&#39;s Asian Relationships spokeswoman Pansy Wong.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Government&#39;s been asked to draw up a list of approved private education providers to meet growing concerns about the wellbeing of Chinese students.</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard&#39;s trip was clearly nothing more than a waste of taxpayers&#39; money,&quot; says Mrs Wong.</p>
<p>&quot;No PR stunt can mask the real problem. The recent high profile failure of several education institutions has exposed the lack of robust monitoring and follow-up systems in the sector.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not surprising the Chinese Government is now calling for firm assurances that students studying here will be looked after.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has failed to enforce its export education sectors Code of Pastoral Care,&quot; says Mrs Wong.</p>
<p>&quot;The Code has fallen victim to inaction and, as a result, poor insitutions continue to burden the export education industry and New Zealand&#39;s economy.</p>
<p>&quot;A recent report commissioned by Auckland City says that international students generate $930 million annually and have created 12,800 fulltime jobs in the region. &quot;The Government must act quickly to establish a robust monitoring system for institutions that are signatories to the Code or we will lose more students,&quot; says Mrs Wong.  </p>
