<p>Polytechnic MECA Talks Back on Track</p>
<p>As a result of mediation held in Auckland yesterday, formal negotiations have resumed between the Association of Staff in Tertiary Education (ASTE) and the six polytechnics and institute of technology employers who have been hit by strike action during the last week.</p>
<p>ASTE National President, Lloyd Woods said today, “the MECA talks are back on track and we will be resuming negotiations next Tuesday.” He said he believes that mediation has been instrumental in getting the talks moving again and in the shift the employers have made to some of their claims. “The employers are no longer looking to increase the number of teaching days and there are also indications from management that there will be movement on salaries. This is all positive”.</p>
<p>Mr. Woods said that ASTE members had demonstrated their depth of feeling about the position the employers had taken by participating in unprecedented strike action. “We believe the employers have taken account of those feelings and that has been reflected in the willingness of the parties to get back into talks”. He added that while there are still some significant and difficult issues on the table he believed the parties could work through those to reach a satisfactory resolution.  </p>
