<p>Bridging the Information Divide</p>
<p>Computer science researchers from Waikato University are helping UNESCO bridge the information gap between developing countries and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Professor Ian Witten, Dr David Bainbridge and Mr Michael Dewsnip from the New Zealand Digital Library (NZDL) research group have been asked to teach at a UNESCO-sponsored workshop on the Greenstone Software in Fiji.</p>
<p>Developed by the NZDL group, the Greenstone Software is widely used by UNESCO and other world aid organisations to distribute humanitarian information in developing countries.</p>
<p>Greenstone enables UNESCO to compile virtual libraries on user-friendly CD-Roms that are distributed widely in developing countries, in areas that lack information resources and have slow and unstable communication networks</p>
<p>Each CD contains resources on topics like fair-trade marketing, medical information, agriculture, environmental conservation and culture.</p>
<p>Prof. Witten says the CD-Roms are part of the ‘Information for All’ project, which aims to close the information gap between developing countries and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>“The Fiji workshop is one of many that UNESCO run throughout the world each year, to train representatives from developing countries how to use the Greenstone software,” says Prof. Witten.</p>
<p>“Those who attend the workshop then go back to their own country and train others how to use Greenstone to access information in existing libraries and eventually create their own.”</p>
<p>UNESCO has been liasing with the NZDL and using Greenstone for over 4 years. It was one of the first organisations to adopt the unique software.</p>
<p>The Fiji workshop runs for three days, with representatives attending from developing countries across the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>Freely available under the GNU Public Licence (GPL), Greenstone is used globally by a range of organisations, from humanitarian aid and disaster relief agencies to the BBC, who use the software internally for a 1 million item radio and TV catalogue.</p>
<p>Earlier this year Professor Witten was named as the seventh recipient of the Namur Award, a prestigious international humanitarian honour that recognises recipients for raising awareness of the social implications of information and communication technologies</p>
