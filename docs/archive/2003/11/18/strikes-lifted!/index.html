<p>Strikes Lifted!</p>
<p>The Association of Staff in Tertiary Education (ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa) has lifted strike action planned for this week in order to return to mediation with the six polytechnic and institute of technology employers who have been engaged in the multi- employer collective employment agreement (MECA) negotiations with the union since January this year.</p>
<p>ASTE National President, Lloyd Woods said today, “Some of the employers have issued cross initiation letters to the union so that they can bargain at site level. We believe that this is a deliberate attempt to undermine the MECA processes that are allowed for under the current legislation.”</p>
<p>He went on to say that the union was seeking legal advice because, “we believe this is illegal and a breach of the Act.”</p>
<p>Mr. Woods added that ASTE members had demonstrated their depth of feeling about the employers’ offers by taking unprecedented strike action. “We hope that the employers will have taken account of these feelings when we meet again,” he said.</p>
<p>Action that was planned for today, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week at different branches has been withdrawn in light of the planned mediation. “In making the decision to withdraw the planned action, our members are showing not just their concern over the cross-initiation, but good faith in moving the MECA negotiations forward.” said Mr. Woods.  </p>
