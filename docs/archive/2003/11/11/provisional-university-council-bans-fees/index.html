<p><strong>Tuesday, 11 November 2003, 4:50 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>First meeting of Provisional University Council Bans Fees</p>
<p>Fees were declared banned at the first meeting of the Provisional University of Otago Council meeting today (Tuesday Nov 11th), as a barrier to equitable access to tertiary education.</p>
<p>Students angry at the University Council&#39;s proposed 5% fee increases attending the University Council meeting today formed the Provisional University Council.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ve had a bloody enough of the Council&#39;s callous disregard for the way fees increases will affect students,&quot; said Mr. Frahame Gogelburg, the newly appointed Vice-Chancellor of the PUC. &quot;We&#39;re taking the power back!!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The University Council was not prepared to acknowledge students anger at the proposed fee increases, despite the presentation of 3000 signatures calling for a zero fee increase, and the outrage of students at the meeting. They have failed us and forced us to take this step,&quot; said Catherine May Secretary of the PUC.</p>
<p>The PUC also discussed other motions that were designed to reduce barriers to tertiary education, and that would contribute positively to the creation of a true Knowledge wave society.  </p>
