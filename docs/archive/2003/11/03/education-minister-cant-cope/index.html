<p>Education Minister Can&#39;t Cope</p>
<p>Recent events show that Trevor Mallard is suffering from a crisis of mismanagement in education, ACT&#39;s education spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard has constantly claimed the main reason for closing schools has been predicted falls in roll sizes. But his figures are wrong and he now admits that.</p>
<p>&quot;He also cites spare classrooms. The truth is there are few spare classrooms, just a Ministry following his orders to classify gyms, halls and resource rooms as &#39;extra teaching spaces&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;He says school closures will save money. Answers to my parliamentary questions, quoted in today&#39;s Sunday Star Times, show Wainuiomata alone cost $19 million and that won&#39;t be recovered for 13 years.</p>
<p>&quot;I have also discovered Timaru&#39;s review will cost $35 million. There are 11 reviews being undertaken at present so we can conservatively guess this will cost taxpayers a further $300 million,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;Adding to the Minister&#39;s crisis is revelations that the head of the Teachers Council, Margaret Kouvelis, has &#39;resigned&#39;. After three years of planning, this Crown Entity has done nothing for education, instead spending its time squabbling about union-related issues. Kouvelis didn&#39;t jump; she was pushed - in secret. This is a public entity and taxpayers are entitled to know what&#39;s going on.</p>
<p>&quot;All over New Zealand schools are struggling while this Minister swans around overseas. Children as young as six are being stood down for physically assaulting teachers, yet the Minister can&#39;t answer my questions regarding the details of these offences.</p>

<p>&quot;The Ministry of Education, under Trevor Mallard&#39;s direction, is more concerned with spending money on buildings than teaching children to read, write and add up. More than $6 million is spent annually on maintaining empty schools the Minister has closed; and hundreds of thousands is spent on security surveillance of abandoned schools because the Office of Treaty Settlements must have first refusal.</p>
<p>&quot;At a time when 20 percent of school children leave secondary school unable to read a bus timetable we should be focusing all our resources on parents, teachers and students to make sure all children grow up able to lead independent, happy lives.</p>
<p>&quot;The ACT Party believes the future of our children is far more important than closing and merging our greatest schools,&quot; Miss Coddington said. &quot;If we want no child left behind, we have to save our schools.&quot;  </p>
