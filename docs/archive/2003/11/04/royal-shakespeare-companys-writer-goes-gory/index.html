<p>Royal Shakespeare Company&#39;s Writer Goes Gory</p>
<p>Unrequited love, rape, infanticide and cannibalism are a tall order to produce on a stage slightly bigger than a queen size bed - but The Three Birds, directed by Geoff Pinfield at Studio 77, manages it.</p>
<p><img src="http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/0311/d02cb627ec39f3b67bfb.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The first play written by Joanna Laurens (now the Royal Shakespeare Company&#39;s writer in residence), The Three Birds is a physical and lyrical retelling of an ancient Greek myth that was the inspiration for Shakespeare&#39;s Titus Andronicus.</p>
<p>&quot;The Three Birds is my graduation production for the Masters directing course run by Toi Whakaari: NZ Drama School and Victoria University,&quot; said Geoff Pinfield. &quot;So I&#39;m incorporating everything I&#39;ve learnt over the last two years - not only is the writing incredibly beautiful, but we&#39;re using mask, puppetry, aerial work, choral work and live music to tell the story in a really visceral way.&quot;</p>
<p>The Three Birds is using the space at Studio 77 (77 Fairlie Tce, Victoria University) in a new way - the sixty audience members surround a small triangular space roughly 6 meters on each side, ensuring the audience is intimately involved in the tragedy.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s very intense,&quot; said Pinfield, &quot;But you get that with the Greeks; passion goes wrong and the inevitability of destruction just rolls on in.&quot;</p>
<p>The cast includes Heather O&#39;Carroll (SEEyD), Rosella Hart, Emma Deakin (Netballers), Felix Prevel and Adam Jones, joined by dancer Sacha Copland (Espresso), and is rounded out by Richard Knowles, currently a first year acting students at Toi Whakaari.</p>
