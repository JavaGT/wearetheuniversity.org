<p>Hands-off Ministry slated for school food policy</p>
<p>Sue Kedgley says the refusal of the Ministry of Health to even draw up guidelines on healthy eating in schools makes a mockery of its claim that it is giving high priority in its health strategy to nutrition and the reduction of obesity.</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley, the Green Health spokesperson, said she was disturbed by the Ministry&#39;s apparent lack of interest in trying to limit the sale of unhealthy foods and drink through school tuckshops. The Ministry was reported today to have no guidelines for high-sugar drinks, leaving it up to individual Boards of Trustees to set the rules.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry has not yet expressed a whimper of concern about the presence of fizzy-drink vending machines in schools, yet their own nutrition survey found that one quarter of our children&#39;s astronomically high sugar intake is coming from soft drink.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of the release of last week&#39;s alarming Children&#39;s Nutrition Survey, which showed that 30 per cent of New Zealand children are overweight or obese, the Ministry should be taking immediate action to improve the food our children eat - including what&#39;s eaten in schools around New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;By abrogating its responsibility to each school&#39;s Board of Trustees, the Ministry of Health is undermining its own childhood health strategy and national nutrition goals. What&#39;s the point of carrying out the expensive, resource intensive nutrition survey if it is not prepared to act on its findings?&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley commended the schools that have adopted healthy-eating tuckshop policies and withdrawn fizzy-drink vending machines from their grounds, and said the Ministry should call on all schools to follow their example.</p>

<p>&quot;Ask any of the principals at these schools and they&#39;ll tell you what a huge influence diet has on young children. Students are learning more effectively and many schools have noticed a decline in restless behaviour - especially during afternoon classes.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry should take note of this. Healthy children of today will create far fewer problems tomorrow for a health system that is already struggling to cope.</p>
<p>&quot;In the meantime, while we await leadership from the Ministry of Health, I urge all schools to seriously consider the health effects of the food they sell through their tuckshops. Getting rid of vending machines selling sugar-laden fizzy drinks would be a great place to start,&quot; said Ms Kedgley.  </p>
