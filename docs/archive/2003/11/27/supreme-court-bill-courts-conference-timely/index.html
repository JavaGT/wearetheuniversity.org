<p>The opening session will focus on theoretical issues around the Courts’ role vis a vis Parliament. Professor George Williams, Director of the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law at the University of New South Wales and renowned theorist Professor Mark Tushnet from Georgetown University Law Centre will speak on the subject. They will be joined by Claudia Geiringer, Deputy Director of Victoria’s Centre for Public Law, Sir Geoffrey Palmer, and chair Sir David Williams QC.</p>
