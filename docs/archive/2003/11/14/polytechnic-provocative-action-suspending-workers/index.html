<p>Polytechnic Takes Provocative Action by Suspending Workers</p>
<p>The suspension of striking staff at Northland Polytechnic is a provocative action by the employer which will not help to resolve the dispute, Council of Trade Unions president Ross Wilson said today.</p>
<p>Hundreds of staff at six North Island polytechnics walked off the job this week in support of a pay rise.</p>
<p>Northland Polytechnic staff have not been offered any increase, and are now facing suspension.</p>
<p>“It’s bad enough that these workers haven’t been offered a pay rise, but now they are being suspended for trying to get a fair settlement,” Ross Wilson said.</p>
<p>The move will backfire on the employer, he said.</p>
<p>“It will consolidate community support for the workers, as well as support from the CTU’s affiliated unions representing almost 300,000 members.”</p>
<p>Tertiary institutions should be setting a good example as state employers, Ross Wilson said.</p>
<p>“They must make a decent pay offer and get back to mediation to avoid further disruption.”  </p>
