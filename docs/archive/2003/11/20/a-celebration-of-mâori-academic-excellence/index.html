<p>Media Release</p>
<p>A Celebration of Mâori Academic Excellence</p>
<p>Waikato University is again honoured to host the National Maori Academic Excellence Awards, to be held on Friday 28 November at the Waikato Stadium.</p>
<p>The criteria for the award is the conferment of a Doctoral qualification from any New Zealand tertiary institution within the period 31 July 2002 to 31 July 2003. This year, 27 award recipients have been confirmed with representation from Waikato, Massey, Victoria, Canterbury, Auckland, Lincoln, and Otago. A Lifetime Award will also be presented on the night.</p>
<p>The event, supported by major sponsors the Tertiary Education Commission, Waikato Raupatu Lands Trust, Maori Education Trust, NIWA, Te Ohu Kaimoana, Te Puni Kokiri and Te Taura Whiri, provides an opportunity for the tertiary sector to come together in recognition of the growing profile of Mâori academic excellence.</p>
<p>Dr Sarah Jane Tiakiwai was an award recipient in 2002: “It is important to highlight Mâori academic excellence. There are increasing numbers coming through PhD level now, but who knows about them? Awards such as these provide due recognition, and show that Mâori are now moving in all spheres of academia”.</p>
<p>To support the occasion, well-known m Mâori musicians and performers from across the country will provide the evening’s entertainment.</p>
<p>The event will be a highlight of the Mâori academic calendar, and with the numbers of Mâori enrolling and graduating at Phd level increasing significantly, the trend of recognition and celebration looks set to continue well into the future.</p>
