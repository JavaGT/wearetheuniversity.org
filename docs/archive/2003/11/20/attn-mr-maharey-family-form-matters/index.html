<p>ATTN: Mr Maharey - family form matters</p>
<p>Yesterday Social Development Minister, Mr Maharey said, &quot;I know of no social science that says a nuclear family is more successful than other kinds.&quot;</p>
<p>It appears that the Minister is either unfamiliar or is ignoring a large body of evidence that shows the best family environment for children is with their two natural parents.</p>
<p>We draw his attention to the work of David Popenoe of Rutgers University (USA), who has probably done more research on family and marriage than anyone else in the world. In a New York Times feature article called the &quot;Controversial Truth&quot;, Prof. Popenoe said:</p>
<p>&quot;Social science research is almost never conclusive. There are always methodological difficulties and stones left unturned. Yet in three decades of work as a social scientist, I know of few other bodies of data in which the weight of evidence is so decisively on one side of the issue: on the whole, for children, two-parent families are preferable...If our prevailing views on family structure hinged solely on scholarly evidence, the current debate would never have arisen in the first place.&quot; New York Times, 26 December 1992, (p. A21)</p>
<p>Mr Maharey should objectively examine the evidence and diversify his reading before promoting all forms of family as being equal in outcomes.</p>
<p>If the government is genuinely interested in the best interests of children then it should support the family form proven to be most successful.</p>
<p>Ends.</p>
