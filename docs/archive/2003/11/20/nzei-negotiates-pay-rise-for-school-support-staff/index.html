<p>NZEI Negotiates Pay Rise For School Support Staff</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa has negotiated two pay rises for 9000 support staff, who are members of the union, and work in both primary and secondary schools throughout New Zealand.</p>
<p>The support staff and kaiarahi i te reo, who are fluent Maori speakers, work in primary, secondary, intermediate, middle and area schools as teacher aides, administration staff, executive officers, science and IT technicians, librarians, therapists, sports co-ordinators and in many other non teaching roles.</p>
<p>They represent more than 20% of the membership of NZEI Te Riu Roa, the country&#39;s largest education union, which also represents primary and early childhood teachers, staff in special education and the schools&#39; advisory service.</p>
<p>The union began negotiating with the Ministry of Education in October. Talks resumed this month and settlement was reached after a further four days of negotiation.</p>
<p>The settlement involves two collective agreements, the support staff in schools agreement, which covers the majority of support staff and a second agreement that covers those who work as kaiarahi i te reo, special education assistants and assistants to teachers of students with severe disabilities.</p>
<p>The key points of the settlements, which are subject to ratification by the support staff, are: • Two pay rises of 2.5%, the first taking affect on January 1 next year, the second from January 5, 2005. • A new section that protects members&#39; rights when their school is involved in a merger as the result of an area review. • An extra week&#39;s annual leave available after four years service. This was previously available after seven years service. • A retirement savings scheme, with a contribution from the employer, that will be available to all members covered by the agreements, from July next year.</p>

<p>Support staff will vote in a postal ballot, whether to accept the settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;The union is recommending that members accept this settlement,&quot; says NZEI Te Riu Roa Vice President, Colin Tarr.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the pay rises, enhanced leave provisions, the retirement savings scheme and the clearer protection for members who are involved in future school mergers, represents a good package,&quot; says Colin Tarr.  </p>
