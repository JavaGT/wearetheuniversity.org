<p>Waikato University Looks At Major Capital Spending</p>
<p>Waikato University plans to invest nearly $70 million over the next five years on improvements to its Hamilton campus, including up to $57 million on new facilities, a $2.5 million revamp of the way the campus looks and works, and $7.1 million on upgrading existing facilities and other ongoing work.</p>
<p>“As we approach our 40th year, Waikato University can look forward to the future with confidence,” says Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould.</p>
<p>“We have taken our place in the forefront of New Zealand universities and we enjoy an excellent reputation around the world.</p>
<p>Our plans for further development will allow us to build on these achievements.</p>
<p>“Our capital programme will ensure that Waikato University continues to provide modern, first-class facilities that will meet the needs of our domestic and international students, as well as provide an attractive place for staff to work,” Professor Gould says.</p>
<p>“The goal is to create an even more user-friendly and vibrant campus, and to help the University better serve students, staff and the Hamilton community.”</p>
<p>Some of the bigger projects include proposals to: Spend up to $15 million for additional space for Waikato Management School facilities and other users.</p>
<p>Spend up to $13 million for a new building housing a number of schools and other university activities. Use $10 million for a new Information Commons, to provide centralised study and computer services to students. Also, $2.5 million is already committed for next year for new engineering accommodation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the University is also currently assessing a variety of recommendations from urban design consultants to enable the campus and its facilities to work even better for students, staff and the community. Up to $2.5 million is budgeted for this work over the next five years.</p>
<p>“The proposals include making it easier for people to find their way around, improving pedestrian routes and creating a significant new social gathering area near the Library,” says Professor Gould.</p>
<p>“A larger marae area, more eating facilities and improved bus services to and from campus are also being considered.</p>
<p>“We are working hard to ensure that the University’s financial performance over the next few years enables us to undertake these exciting projects and to invest in what promises to be a dynamic future for the University.”  </p>
