<p>Another Immigration Scam In Paradise</p>
<p>New Zealand First has accused the Immigration Minister of allowing a jobs for residency scam to operate under her nose at the Immigration Service in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters raised the issue in Parliament today, asking the Prime Minister whether Lianne Dalziel had told her that the Immigration Service was offering jobs to foreign nationals and fast-tracked permanent residence in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The Government should explain why New Zealanders are being denied jobs in favour of Indian, Chinese and Thai nationals.</p>
<p>“If employees with some specific skills from these communities are required, surely they could have been recruited from the hundreds of thousands of immigrants the Government has already brought into the country.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters said the most alarming case was that of one individual recruited under this scheme, who arrived in New Zealand, worked for the Immigration Service, gained residency and then left after only one month to set up an immigration consultancy business.</p>
<p>“This is stupid and could only happen in New Zealand under the most incompetent Immigration Minister in history,” he said.</p>
