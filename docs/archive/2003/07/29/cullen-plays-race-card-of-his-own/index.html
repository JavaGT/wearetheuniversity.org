<p><strong>Tuesday, 29 July 2003, 1:33 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Cullen plays race card of his own</p>
<p>National Party Leader Bill English is strongly rejecting unsubstantiated accusations by Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen that he&#39;s guilty of inciting race hatred.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s ridiculous, all the National Party is doing is holding the Government to account for the promises it made over the beaches and seabed issue six weeks ago.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Party has been doing its job as an effective opposition,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;By association, Dr Cullen&#39;s now accusing the thousands upon thousands of concerned New Zealanders who&#39;ve signed our <a href="http://www.beachesforall.co.nz">www.beachesforall.co.nz</a> petition or taken to the streets in protest.</p>
<p>&quot;If we are guilty of anything, it is trying to make the Government deliver on its promises.</p>
<p>&quot;Months ago the National Party identified Treaty issues as a major challenge for New Zealand - long before the beaches and seabed issue bubbled to the surface.</p>
<p>&quot;We have consistently accused Labour of refusing to debate these important issues in public and now we have proof, with the Government negotiating a secret deal to settle Maori claims to the foreshore.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour had promised to guarantee exclusive Crown title to the beaches and seabed, but ever since the Government has been backing away.</p>
<p>&quot;To the contrary, National&#39;s position is very clear, we stand for one standard of citizenship and we don&#39;t believe there&#39;s any room for compromise on the ownership of our beaches and seabed,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
