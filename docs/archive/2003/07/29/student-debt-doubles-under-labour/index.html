<p>Student debt doubles under Labour: students call for a living allowance for all students</p>
<p>Student debt has doubled under Labour and is now past the $6 billion mark according to government response to an official information request from the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA) under the Official Information Act. Students are calling on the government to ease the debt burden by immediately introducing a living allowance for all students.</p>
<p>&quot;Six billion dollars of debt is a disgrace to a government that say they want a knowledge economy and society,&quot; said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of NZUSA. &quot;Urgent action is required, the government must use the long awaited student support review to deliver on their promises.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Students are the only group in society that must borrow to live. Only a third of all full time students are eligible for an allowance, while the rest are wracking up big debts,&quot; said Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>&quot;The best way to ensure that student debt does not continue increasing dramatically every year is to introduce a living allowance for all students to ensure that students do not have to rely on the harsh and unfair student loan scheme to survive&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This huge debt threatens our economy and our society. There&#39;s already too many graduates leaving New Zealand, workforce shortages in key social areas and people putting off having children because of the disastrous student loan scheme.&quot;  </p>
