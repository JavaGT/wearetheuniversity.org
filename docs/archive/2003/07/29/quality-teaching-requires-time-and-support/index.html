<p>Quality Teaching Requires Time And Support</p>
<p>Wellington – NZEI Te Riu Roa, which represents primary and early childhood teachers, supports research released today that highlights how crucial quality teaching is to student performance.</p>
<p>The Minister of Education, Trevor Mallard, has today released three reports that bring together research done overseas and in New Zealand on how to improve students’ learning.</p>
<p>A key finding of the research is that quality teaching is the most influential factor on student achievement in schools and early childhood education centres. Mr Mallard has stated as a result of this research the government is giving a commitment that it will focus on quality teaching as a priority for schooling and early childhood education centres.</p>
<p>“NZEI Te Riu Roa welcomes Mr Mallard’s commitment to making quality teaching a priority for schooling and early childhood education centres. Teachers are strongly committed to providing a quality education for New Zealand’s children and are working hard to ensure what they do is effective,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa National Vice President, Colin Tarr.</p>
<p>“The research issued today is a valuable tool that we can use to help improve outcomes for students. The union’s message to the Minister is that we have to work together to make that happen.”</p>
<p>“What the Minister must do is ensure that teachers are given the time to focus on delivering quality teaching. Far too much of their time is taken up in dealing with paperwork from Wellington. The last thing they need is another raft of bureaucratic demands to meet. What they need is time to teach.”</p>

<p>“They also need time in their working day to assess how their students are performing and to sit down with each student to discuss their progress. Plus they need time to talk with their teacher colleagues and education experts so that together they can develop ways of ensuring that each child is performing to the best of their ability.”</p>
<p>“This is the nuts and bolts of quality teaching. It is a partnership and it requires time and resources to implement,” says Colin Tarr.</p>
<p>“The Government spends around $120 million a year on the professional development of teachers and the Minister says he wants value for money from that spending. NZEI Te Riu Roa looks forward to working with the Minister on ensuring that it is spent effectively.”</p>
<p>“The union is also looking forward to working with the Government, the Ministry of Education and the other key players in the education sector to make the best use of the research that has been issued today to ensure that all New Zealand children receive a quality education,” says Colin Tarr  </p>
