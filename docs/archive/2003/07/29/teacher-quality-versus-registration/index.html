<p>Teacher Quality Versus Registration</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today that reports indicating 25 percent of New Zealand schools have unregistered teachers in their classrooms - and that two schools have unregistered principals - raises the question of whether registration should be a necessary requirement for teachers.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that a teacher is registered with the Teachers&#39; Council does not ensure the quality of that teacher,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is imperative that teachers are equipped with knowledge of the subjects they are to teach. Whether that means a computer programmer with practical experience in that field - but with no formal teacher training - is preferred to someone else who has spent three years at Teachers&#39; College, then so be it.</p>
<p>&quot;Having to attend Teacher&#39;s College can be a disincentive for potential teachers - many of whom have the qualifications or experience, but are put off by the prospect of a further three years&#39; study. By insisting that teachers are registered, the education sector is missing out on people with great energy and high intellectual ability.</p>
<p>&quot;An obsession with irrelevant political correctness, theory-driven programmes - rather than practice-driven - and an outdated teaching culture are also factors which combine to make Teacher Training and unattractive option. As a result, we have many second-rate teaching graduates, who become registered teachers, instructing our children.</p>

<p>&quot;While ACT understands the importance of vetting teachers - and advocates police checks to ensure a safe learning environment for children - the current register is providing parents with a false impression that their children are receiving a high-quality education.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of the day, the focus must shift from ensuring that all teachers are registered. The priority is to attract quality men and women into the profession, to make a real difference in the lives of young New Zealanders - whose education should be the focus, not the wishes of the Teachers&#39; Council,&quot; Miss Coddington said.  </p>
