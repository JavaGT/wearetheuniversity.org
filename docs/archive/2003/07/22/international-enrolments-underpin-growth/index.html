<p>MEDIA RELEASE 22 July 2003<br>Public Affairs<br>International enrolments underpin Victoria enrolment growth</p>
<p>Victoria University continues to experience strong growth in enrolments, with an increasing numbers of international students in Trimester 2.</p>
<p>At the end of last week (July 18), the University had enrolled 1,931 students for Trimester 2 compared with a total of 1,446 for the whole of Trimester 2 last year. Enrolments for Trimester 2 close at the end of this week (July 25).</p>
<p>With more than 17,108 students so far enrolled at the University this year, Victoria has already broken the record of 16,624 students it enrolled for the whole of 2002. Enrolments will get a further boost in November when students enrol for Summer Trimester courses.</p>
<p>So far in July, the 444 new international enrolments for Trimester 2 represents an increase of 39 percent compared to the same time last year. In the year-to-date, the University has enrolled about 1,900 international students in undergraduate and graduate programmes and a further 234 in English Proficiency courses.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon said the strategic approach the University had taken in its international marketing continued to pay dividends.</p>
<p>&quot;Victoria actively markets in only 13 countries and has focused on developing strong and diverse channels through which students come to New Zealand. That successful strategy was recognised by Trade New Zealand in recently naming Victoria as the Education Exporter of the Year.</p>

<p>&quot;The number of students from China remains steady and we have seen no obvious evidence of a SARS driven downturn that has affected other parts of the industry. Trimester 2 enrolments have also seen a continued trend of increased student numbers from the United States and Germany. Enrolments from these two countries now account for almost 300 students.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor McCutcheon said Victoria was increasingly seen as the destination of choice for international students by providing quality education in a supportive environment.</p>
<p>&quot;Our commitment to providing quality academic support and pastoral care for international students saw Victoria last year being one of the first institutions to comply with the Ministry of Education&#39;s Code of Practice. New Zealand is also seen by the parents of international students as a relatively safe place for their children to get a taste for living overseas.&quot;</p>
