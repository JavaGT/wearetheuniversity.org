<p>Active Consensus-Building Needed for Retirement Savings Policy</p>
<p>The challenge for the Savings Forum meeting tomorrow is to identify a process which will achieve a consensus on retirement savings policy, Council of Trade Unions president Ross Wilson said today.</p>
<p>Politicians, employers and trade unions meet in Wellington at the Saving New Zealand Forum, being held to find a way to increase private savings.</p>
<p>“The status quo will not achieve the development of the second-tier employment-based saving schemes which we need,” Ross Wilson said.</p>
<p>“Working people are often struggling to pay personal debts, mortgages and student loans, and don’t feel they can afford to save for their retirement,” he said.</p>
<p>The CTU supported law changes which would reduce prospectus requirements and allow tax on employer contributions to retirement savings to be at the marginal tax rate.</p>
<p>“There needs to be a requirement for deductions to be made for retirement savings when employees ask for it,” Ross Wilson said. “And employer contributions will be needed for any significant boost to employment-based retirement savings.”  </p>
