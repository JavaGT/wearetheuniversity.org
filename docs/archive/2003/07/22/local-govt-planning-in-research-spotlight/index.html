<p>Local government strategic planning in research spotlight</p>
<p>A joint research project aimed at strengthening local government planning capability was launched today (22 July) by her Worship, the Mayor of Wellington, Kerry Prendergast.</p>
<p>Professor Claudia Scott of Victoria University’s School of Government leads a team from Victoria, along with researchers from Local Government New Zealand, Auckland University and the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research.</p>
<p>The Strategic Policy and Planning Project, funded at $1.25 million over five years by the Foundation for Research Science and Technology (FORST), will help councils improve their strategic policy capability and develop long-term community plans that deliver economic, social, environmental and cultural outcomes.</p>
<p>Researchers will design an evaluative framework to benchmark existing strategic planning practice and draw on practices in New Zealand and in other countries to develop strategies for improving capability and performance.</p>
<p>Detailed study and analysis of 15 New Zealand local authorities will be undertaken. A key goal of the project will be to share information among local governments and to encourage improvements in strategic policy and planning practice. The project will form partnerships with local authorities, foster innovative approaches to strategic planning and assist local governments to meet the policy and planning challenges posed by the new Local Government Act.</p>
<p>The launch will take place at 12 noon, Tuesday 22 July, Council Chambers (Wellington Town Hall).  </p>
