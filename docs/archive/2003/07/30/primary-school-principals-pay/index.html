<p><strong>Wednesday, 30 July 2003, 2:29 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZEI">NZEI</a></strong></p>
<p>Principals Pay</p>
<p>I&#39;ve had a couple of calls in response to the release on the primary principals offer asking what do they earn. The following will given an indication of what they are paid now and what they will get if they accept the offer.</p>
<p>Principals are paid according to the size of their school.</p>
<p>A U1 school has 1 to 50 students<br>The base pay for a U1 principal is currently $56,424. If they accept<br>the offer that will rise to $60,600.<br>That&#39;s an extra $4176 a year.</p>
<p>A U9 school has 1026 to 1200 students.<br>The base pay for a principal of a U9 school is currently $89,812.<br>If the offer is accepted that will rise to $96,614.<br>That&#39;s an extra $6802 a year.</p>
<p>The U scale goes beyond U9 but there are no primary schools with more than 1200 students at present.</p>
<p>Principals receive money on top of their base pay. Under the current collective agreement this supplementary grant is based on the actual number of students at their school.</p>
<p>If they accept the offer the supplementary grant will be calculated in a different way and will be based on how many TEACHERS at their school.</p>
<p>Hope this is of some help.</p>
