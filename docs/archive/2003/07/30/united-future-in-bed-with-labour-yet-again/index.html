<p><strong>Wednesday, 30 July 2003, 9:40 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>United Future in bed with Labour yet again</p>
<p>The National Party is accusing United Future of sacrificing democracy in favour of its political allegiance with Labour.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s already hard to spot any difference between Peter Dunne and the Government, United&#39;s decision today to support retrospective legislation on the Harry Duynhoven case confirms that opinion,&quot; says National Party Deputy Leader Roger Sowry.</p>
<p>&quot;As National Party Leader Bill English pointed out yesterday, the arguments for a retrospective law change to protect the MP are unconvincing, they&#39;re also unprincipled and unconstitutional &quot;Despite claims to the contrary, this is not an archaic law which hasn&#39;t been changed in 150 years.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been seven amendments to the Electoral Act since 1993, including one just last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Duynhoven&#39;s situation is no different from the thousands of New Zealanders who get caught &#39;unintentionally&#39; speeding every day,&quot; Mr Sowry says.</p>
<p>&quot;Those law breakers have to live with the consequences of their actions and Labour (with United Future&#39;s support) cannot put one of its own MPs above the law.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Party does not want to spend taxpayer money on a New Plymouth by-election, but this is an issue of principle that rises above any inconvenience,&quot; Mr Sowry says.</p>
