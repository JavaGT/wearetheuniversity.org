<p><strong>Monday, 14 July 2003, 8:51 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National Party elects President and new board</p>
<p>National Party Leader Bill English says he is delighted the Party&#39;s newly elected Board of Directors has reinstalled Judy Kirk as President.</p>
<p>&quot;Judy and I have worked closely over the past year to get the framework in place that will allow National to fight a successful campaign under MMP,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;She&#39;s been there to oversee the strategic review and the constitutional changes which have been embraced by our members this year.</p>
<p>Mrs Kirk was one of seven directors appointed at the National Party Conference in Christchurch, she was appointed president after a meeting this morning.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s a good mix of experience and new blood,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>Six others from the Party will join Mrs Kirk on the Board of Directors, they are:</p>
<p>Jeff Grant, (Rangitikei/Clutha-Southland)</p>
<p>Scott Simpson (Rodney/North Shore)</p>
<p>Alan Towers (Epsom/Northcote)</p>
<p>Roger Bridge, (Ilam/Kaikoura)</p>
<p>David Bennett, (Piako/Taranaki-King Country)</p>
<p>Eric Roy, (Invercargill/Otago)</p>
<p>Mr English and Whangarei MP Phil Heatley will represent the National Party Caucus on the Board.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Party&#39;s getting back to business and I&#39;m looking forward to working with the new team at the top,&quot; Mr English says.</p>
