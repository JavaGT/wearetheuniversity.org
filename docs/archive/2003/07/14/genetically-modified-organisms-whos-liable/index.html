<p><strong>Monday, 14 July 2003, 9:56 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Genetically modified organisms – who’s liable?</p>
<p>With suspect corn on Japanese pizzas under the scientific and media microscope, what better time to discuss GMO liability.</p>
<p>Victoria University Economics Masters student, Stephen Hutton, will raise the liability issues of genetic modification on Wednesday in a seminar hosted by the University-based New Zealand Institute for the Study of Competition and Regulation. Mr Hutton is also a research assistant in the ISCR.</p>
<p>His presentation considers the role of liability in providing incentives to reduce risk associated with GMO accidents. The moratorium on GMOs is scheduled to be lifted on 29 October, 2003.</p>
<p>“The issue of GMOs has been one of the most controversial and polarising political issues for many years,” Mr Hutton says.</p>
<p>“It now seems clear the Government will allow some GMO release, so the focus of the debate should move to the institutional system in which this release occurs.</p>
<p>“One aspect of this system is the liability regime, which determines under what circumstances users of GMOs are liable for damages caused by any GMO accidents.</p>
<p>“Under current law, GMOs will generally be covered by a negligence regime, but this may not be the best system.”</p>
<p>Mr Hutton says GMOs may have the potential to cause accidents that inflict damage on third parties such as crop contamination.</p>
<p>“In an unregulated market without liability, companies conducting genetic modification would have little incentive to take costly precautions to reduce the probability or severity of accidents.”</p>
<p>Mr Hutton’s presentation is based on his final Masters thesis. In late July he departs Victoria University to begin his PhD studies in the University of Maryland’s economics programme.</p>
<p>Media are welcome to attend the seminar on Wednesday 16 July, 6pm-7pm, Lecture Theatre 2, Government Buildings, Lambton Quay.  </p>
