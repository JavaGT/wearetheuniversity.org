<p>31 July, 2003<br>Prostitution referendum a return to dark ages</p>
<p>Green MP Sue Bradford has slammed the United Future MPs responsible for launching a citizens initiated referendum aimed at repealing the Prostitution Reform Act.</p>
<p>She said the United Future Party seemed hell-bent on stopping dead any progressive social reform.</p>
<p>&quot;It is reprehensible that Gordon Copeland and Larry Baldock launch this petition without giving any chance for this law to work,&quot; said Ms Bradford.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an automatic review process enshrined in this law to comprehensively study and address any issues arising from the passing of the Prostitution Reform Act.</p>
<p>&quot;United Future would rather us all be damned to the past, living under the Victorian-era hypocrisy of convicting and condemning women who sell sexual services while protecting men who buy them.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Bradford said that she was wary that the public would be fed a diet of misinformation and dogma and therefore any result of a citizens initiated referendum would not be based on a true and objective reading of the evidence.</p>
<p>&quot;This Act was aimed at improving the health, safety and welfare of one of the most vulnerable and exploited groups of workers in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet all we heard was a blatant attempt to obscure the truth by claiming the Act would encourage child prostitution and make New Zealand the sex capital of the South Pacific.</p>
<p>&quot;This Act was aimed at curing the evils of the sex industry and enabling workers in the industry to move on to other employment.</p>

<p>&quot;Otherwise, we have the shameful situation where women are trapped in the industry because of unfair convictions that provide a major barrier to gaining employment elsewhere.</p>
<p>&quot;The backers of this referendum have exposed themselves as living in a time-warp by believing the sex industry would flourish under the act - like it hadn&#39;t before. It is a startling lack of reality.</p>
<p>&quot;The criminalisation approach obviously hasn&#39;t worked before, what makes them believe it will work now?&quot; asked Ms Bradford.</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#39;s give decriminalisation a chance before pandering to the unfounded fears and outdated social codes we should have left in the 19th century, much less the 20th.&quot;</p>
