<p><strong>Thursday, 31 July 2003, 11:42 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Surgical penny pinching in Otago just the start</p>
<p>National Party Health spokeswoman Dr Lynda Scott says the penny pinching that has forced the cancellation of scheduled surgery in Dunedin is just the beginning.</p>
<p>&quot;When sick New Zealanders are being forced to wait for surgery because the money has run out, the Health Minister must know there&#39;s a fundamental flaw in the system.</p>
<p>&quot;With forecast District Health Board deficits closing in on the $200 million mark, the scenario at Dunedin Hospital is set to be repeated all over the country.</p>
<p>&quot;Annette King has been pouring millions more taxpayer dollars into health, but it&#39;s going to all the wrong places,&quot; says Dr Scott.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, the Counties Manukau region is set to get $28 million extra this year, but not one cent of that money will go into new services.</p>
<p>&quot;It will only service their increasing deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;The Labour Government&#39;s ideological experiment with our health service is failing, we do not need another layer of bureaucracy, we need doctors and nurses and they need resources to do their jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;I predict District Health Boards will continue to rack up large deficits, deny patients elective surgery, squeeze wage rates and not invest in new equipment.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders deserve better than that,&quot; Dr Scott says.  </p>
