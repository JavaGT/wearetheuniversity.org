<p>First footsteps in new relationship</p>
<p>A collaboration between Waikato University’s Centre for Continuing Education and a Mâori community organisation will be used as a template to enhance relationships between the University and the iwi members of Te Rôpû Manukura, Tainui and the wider Mâori community.</p>
<p>The University’s pro vice-chancellor (academic) Peggy Koopman-Boyden and Rau Awaawa Trust today signed a memorandum of understanding for He Tû Hononga, a Mâori community initiative that provides University-sponsored education programmes for kaumâtua, their whânau and the Frankton/Dinsdale community in Hamilton.</p>
<p>The collaboration is in line with the Government’s tertiary education strategy and funding has been secured by the University to support and resource the educational programmes.</p>
<p>The Trust will continue to provide a number of nil-fee programmes from their premises, Te Puna o Te Ora, including training and employment opportunities, advocacy, information assistance, and social support. Programmes aim to foster Mâori development, self-determination and self-sufficiency within a community development framework.</p>
<p>The University’s pro vice-chancellor Mâori Tamati Reedy says the pilot programme plays an integral role in developing sustainable pathways for Mâori into higher education.</p>
<p>“We see this as a realistic way of providing learning opportunities to Te Ropu Manukura who have a large geographical spread. Further developments will hopefully see us utilising more community centres to reach Mâori and provide them with chances to further their education”.</p>
