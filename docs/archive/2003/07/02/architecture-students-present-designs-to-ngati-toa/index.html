<p>Architecture students to present designs to Ngati Toa</p>
<p>Architecture students from the University of Hawai’i at Manoa and Victoria University of Wellington are presenting hypothetical designs for an Iwi Medical Centre to Ngati Toa at Takapuwahia Marae in Porirua, on Friday 4 July at 4.30pm.</p>
<p>Lecturer in Victoria’s School of Architecture, Mr Robin Skinner, says the design projects are the culmination of a two-week programme focusing on Maori and Pacific architecture and culture, including an introduction to bicultural issues in Aotearoa/ New Zealand.</p>
<p>The programme included a series of lectures, Wellington-based activities such as viewing the Treaty of Waitangi and the Maori and Pacific collection at Te Papa; visits to urban and rural marae and historic Maori sites; and a field study of traditional and contemporary Maori architecture in the lower North Island.</p>
<p>Invited speakers, both academic and professional architects including Maori and Pacific architects and artists, talked about their past and present work. Maori leaders and educators addressed the students on issues affecting them today.</p>
<p>“The hypothetical design schemes, which draw upon the earlier study programme, have been produced jointly by the Hawaiian and Victoria students,” says Mr Skinner.</p>
<p>“Through the design process, the students have worked in close collaboration with Ngati Toa kaumatua, Taku Parai.</p>
<p>“The designs are presented as suggestions for future, long-term development rather than final buildable schemes,” Mr Skinner says.</p>
<p>“We hope the schemes will provide and provoke ideas for future development.”</p>
<p>Maori and Pacific students, including mentors from the Faculty’s Awhina whanau support, other students and staff from Victoria’s Schools of Architecture and Design have been involved in the joint initiative.</p>
