<p><strong>Tuesday, 1 July 2003, 5:25 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Dr Lynda Scott National Health Spokesperson</p>
<p>1 July 2003</p>
<p>Govt must dispense with stat dispensing</p>
<p>The Government is blindly bringing back three-monthly dispensing by pharmacies, even though it will close many rural pharmacies and mean thousands of people lose their jobs, says National Health Spokesperson Dr Lynda Scott.</p>
<p>&quot;Stat dispensing is not necessary, will waste drugs and pose safety risks that people taking medication don&#39;t want.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an unnecessary change that will put in many cases the only local pharmacy for miles out of business.</p>
<p>&quot;In Nelson it is estimated that 25 pharmacist, dispensing and shop assistant jobs will be lost. This mirrors the effect in many centres, and there are already estimates of 2000 jobs being lost.</p>
<p>&quot;Pharmac claims stat dispensing will save money, but it will cost half as much again in the cost of wasted drugs.</p>
<p>&quot;The Health Minister must see sense and listen to the thousands of people who have made submissions against this move,&quot; Dr Scott said.</p>
