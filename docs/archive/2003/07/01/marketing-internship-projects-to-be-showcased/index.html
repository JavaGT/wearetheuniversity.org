<p>Marketing internship projects to be showcased</p>
<p>Four top cases studies from Canterbury University’s highly successful marketing internship programme will be showcased at a symposium hosted jointly with the Canterbury Employers’ Chamber of Commerce in Christchurch tomorrow night.</p>
<p>The internship programme was introduced last summer in partnership with 25 companies covering a range of fields from wine and electronics to cheese and advertising.</p>
<p>Programme Director Dr Robert Peffers, of UC’s Department of Management, described the programme as a “win-win” for companies and students alike. “While students get the marketing experience, companies have marketing activities done that might not otherwise be completed.”</p>
<p>The four projects being showcased on Wednesday cover four quite varied business areas. They are Value Plus Homes, who were assisted with re-branding the company; Forrest Estate Wines, where the project examined opportunities to move into the Asian market; Harvey Cameron Advertising, where different advertising applications in different industries were examined; and Allied Telesyn, where the project focused on the introduction on new internal marketing techniques.</p>
<p>The students were employed full-time for between six and eight weeks and during that time maintained a diary of activities. At the end of the project they were required to give a presentation to the company and to Dr Peffers. The students get six points of university credit for successfully completing the internship assignment.</p>
<p>The symposium, at Bellamy&#39;s in the Provincial Chambers, will be presented to representatives from the top 50 Canterbury businesses.</p>
