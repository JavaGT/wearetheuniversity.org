<p><strong>Tuesday, 15 July 2003, 3:27 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Tenth Anniversary To Celebrate</p>
<p>Celebrations marking one of the most important events on the political calendar - the tenth anniversary of the founding of New Zealand First - will start in Tauranga on Friday.</p>
<p>Leader and Tauranga MP Rt Hon Winston Peters and a loyal team launched the party at a public meeting in Auckland on 18th July 1993.</p>
<p>Mr Peters says that day at Alexandra Park ten years ago led to major changes on the political landscape in New Zealand and an end to the two-party system that destroyed voters’ faith in politics.</p>
<p>“The Labour government of 1984-90 disemboweled New Zealand economically and National took over burying the remains. No governments in the history of New Zealand practiced such political deception.</p>
<p>“The only real improvement came during the time of the first MMP government when New Zealand First took initiatives that improved the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters said that the country was still going through troubled times with unrestrained immigration, racial tensions created by unrealistic Treaty expectations and increasing levels of serious crime.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First will play a major part in restoring voters confidence in the political process over the next ten years. Our time is still to come.”</p>
<p>The celebrations start with a function in Tauranga on Friday night and there will be further events in Wellington and Christchurch.  </p>
