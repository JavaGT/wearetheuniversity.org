<p>School Choice, The Only Choice</p>
<p>A new Education Review Office report on Catholic schools demonstrates the benefits of competition and choice in education, ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;What this report shows is that much-maligned non-state schools, which Education Minister Trevor Mallard is ideologically opposed to, are performing better than most state schools,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is reflected in the fact that over the period of the ERO study, 10 percent of Catholic schools were revisited by the ERO for a supplementary review - compared with 17 percent for all schools. As the report points out, revisits are only carried out where a review has raised issues of poor performance.</p>
<p>&quot;The report also confirms what ACT has been saying since its inception - that schools with special character can provide a unifying force for the whole community. Not only that, but they can also be a breeding ground for academic excellence - a point noted by the Minister in his response to the report.</p>
<p>&quot;The next logical step is to remove the entrance barriers to such schools. The Government&#39;s selective non-preference/preference system, where only five percent of non-Catholic children may attend Catholic schools, means that parents&#39; chances of sending their children to such schools are slim.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents on the Kapiti Coast would be green with envy after reading this report. Especially as their nearest Catholic School, St Patrick&#39;s Primary School, has been forced to reject non-preference pupils after it reached its five percent non-Catholic quota - despite having 102 pupil spaces available.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister should put to rest his prejudices and give parents real choice in education,&quot; Miss Coddington said</p>
