<p><strong>Wednesday, 23 July 2003, 11:23 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour&#39;s legacy of taxes and racial tension</p>
<p>National Party Leader Bill English says Helen Clark appears to have developed yet another case of selective amnesia in the launch of a book heralding the Labour Government&#39;s achievements.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s introduced some 17 sly taxes, and is proposing at least seven more.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#39;ve fuelled racial tension by policies of separatism and they&#39;re allowing welfare dependency to snowball out of control at a time when we&#39;re enjoying the best economic conditions in a generation,&quot; Mr English says.</p>
<p>&quot;The Prime Minister has personally put New Zealand offside with our traditional friends and allies and then refused to offer a genuine apology.</p>
<p>&quot;She has been prepared to apologise on a number of other occasions, but she won&#39;t say sorry to the people that count - the people of New Zealand for her failure to address issues around the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
<p>&quot;She&#39;s dodged more questions than any Prime Minster should be allowed to get away with and she&#39;s refusing to hold her Ministers to account for the mistakes that they make,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>Below is a brief list of the Labour&#39;s real achievements:</p>
<p>*John Tamihere attacks Maori elders</p>
<p>*Parekura Horomia&#39;s horror performance in the House</p>
<p>*Jim Sutton and Pete Hodgson call farmers &quot;whingers&quot;</p>
<p>*Clark butchers hope of a US free trade deal</p>
<p>*Phil Goff is photographed holding hands with Arafat</p>

<p>*Clark&#39;s attacks Knowledge wave conference</p>
<p>*Tamihere attacks Steve Maharey&#39;s &quot;bullshitting&quot; policies</p>
<p>*Clark&#39;s uses of taxpayer subsidies for holidays</p>
<p>*Sutton says the US was &quot;arm twisting&quot; countries to support Iraq War</p>
<p>*Paintergate, Clark admits signing a painting she didn&#39;t paint, later saying she had done this about six or seven times before.</p>
<p>*Alliance poll backdown - Clark was forced to acknowledge she was wrong to accuse the Alliance of &quot;making up&quot; a poll in the crucial Waitakere seat.</p>
<p>*Clark misleads Parliament over Historic Places Trust in response to questions about golden handshakes.</p>
