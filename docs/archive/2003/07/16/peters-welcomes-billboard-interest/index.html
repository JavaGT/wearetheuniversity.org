<p>Peters Welcomes Billboard Interest</p>
<p>New Zealand First has welcomed the interest shown by the Greens and ACT in the highly successful billboards highlighting policy issues.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters today pointed out that all political parties, including the Greens and ACT, were centrally funded and that the expenditure on the billboards was approved by Parliamentary Service.</p>
<p>“We must also point out that the Greens are using tens of thousands of dollars of taxpayers’ money to employ staff to promote marijuana smoking and other whacko anti-social policies.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters described ACT’s comments as “monumental in their hypocrisy”.</p>
<p>“Richard Prebble sets up dubious electorate offices, pays himself the rent and employs staff somewhere else – all at the taxpayers’ expense!”</p>
<p>Mr Peters said his billboards simply pointed out the wisdom of New Zealand First policy and they had been favourably received by people who felt betrayed by the Government’s failure to act responsibly over immigration, law and order and Treaty issues.</p>
<p>“The Government employs huge teams of spin-doctors and spends millions on propaganda. We are simply talking about policies.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters said he could understand why some politicians, such as those in the Greens and Act were reluctant to put their photos on billboards.</p>
<p>“It would be too scary for the children,” he said.  </p>
