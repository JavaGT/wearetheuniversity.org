<p>MEDIA RELEASE 21 July 2003</p>
<p>More phonics or less for teaching reading?</p>
<p>The use of phonics to teach children how to read is called into question by international research undertaken by Victoria University’s School of Education in collaboration with overseas colleagues.</p>
<p>Dr Brian Thompson, Senior Research Associate in the School, says his findings show interesting differences between New Zealand adults and a sample of adults in the UK who have been taught by phonics.</p>
<p>“It appears more phonics teaching at school can interfere with the subsequent long-term development of some more advanced aspects of reading skill,” he says.</p>
<p>“New Zealand adults who were taught reading without phonics at primary school are found to have better reading skills for unfamiliar words, and especially those with the more complex letter-sound patterns of English.</p>
<p>“These New Zealand adults were compared to a matched sample of adults from a region of the United Kingdom who had received far more phonics teaching at primary school.”</p>
<p>Dr Thompson says his research will undoubtedly bring a new perspective to opposing community opinions on the use of phonics as a way of teaching reading. In recent years these strongly held opinions have entered the political arena of educational policy.</p>
<p>His findings will be presented in a public seminar at Victoria University of Wellington School of Education on Thursday 24 July, 12.10pm-1pm in Room E101, Education Prefabs, Gate 6, Kelburn Parade.</p>
