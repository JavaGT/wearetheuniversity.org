<p>National asks Parliamentary Commissioner to intervene over Lake Rotoiti</p>
<p>National Environment Spokesperson Nick Smith is asking the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment to intervene over a serious environmental crisis at Lake Rotoiti, which has been closed for public health reasons.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very concerned at a lack of action by the Ministry for the Environment which should be taking a lead in addressing the causes of pollution in the lake and getting it cleaned up, by objecting to new rules set by the Government which make it harder for local authorities to fix the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;The cynaobacteria bloom in the lake is an environmental disaster, which is already spreading to other lakes in the area. A PhD student was hospitalized after taking surface samples, and a DoC staff member became unwell after skin contact with water from the lake.</p>
<p>&quot;I visited Lake Rotoiti last week to find that it has turned a putrid green yellow colour and the smell is awful. Figures that show the levels of cyanobacteria are three times that of the Waikato River confirm this is an environmental disaster. The condition of the lake is more akin to that of a sewerage pond than a recreational and scenic lake.</p>
<p>&quot;It needs to be cleaned up to prevent further spread to other lakes, and reduce the danger to the tens of thousands of people who use the lakes for fishing, swimming, water skiing and all types of boating.</p>
<p>&quot;The condition of Lake Rotoiti is a warning to many communities of what will happen if issues of nutrient flows, stock management and sewage treatment are not addressed. This requires leadership and, in Lake Rotoiti&#39;s case, the Ministry for the Environment is sadly lacking.</p>
<p>&quot;The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment needs to intervene so that the public authorities involved stop passing the buck and a single person is given responsibility for a lake clean up. The Commissioner can also play an important preventative role in ensuring New Zealand&#39;s other spectacular lakes do not become polluted to this extent,&quot; Dr Smith said</p>
