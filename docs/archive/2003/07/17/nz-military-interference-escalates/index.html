<p>NZ Military Interference Escalates</p>
<p>Another 19 members of the New Zealand Defence Force and an Orion aircraft departed for service in the so-called &#39;War on Terrorism&#39; yesterday. New Zealand support for this military intervention is estimated at $26 million. This endeavour has done little to combat terrorism, but has cost the lives of thousands of civilians in Afghanistan and has left that country in a state of utter lawlessness. New Zealand soldiers are being put in very risky situations, but there is no clarity by this government about what a successful mission would actually be.</p>
<p>&#39;While the Indian Government has refused a United States request for troops without a specific UN mandate, Helen Clark is bending to the wishes of the United States, Britain and Australia. She is willing to legitimise an illegal and immoral war on the people of Iraq to make good with the Bush and his coalition partners.&#39; said Peace Action Wellington spokesperson Valerie Morse</p>
<p>Now the Labour Government has committed more military along with 50 police to become an occupying force - this time in the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>Peace Action Wellington is calling on the Labour Government to immediately end all support for the &#39;War on Terrorism&#39; and cancel its offer of troops to occupy Iraq.</p>
