<p><strong>Wednesday, 9 July 2003, 4:44 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>JPs must do the task - or go</p>
<p>National&#39;s Justice spokesman Richard Worth is calling for closer scrutiny of the work undertaken by Justices of the Peace.</p>
<p>His comments follow claims by the Auckland Justice of the Peace Association&#39;s president that many JPs are ignoring their responsibilities to the public. Some are reportedly refusing to carry out tasks unless they are paid.</p>
<p>&quot;JPs aren&#39;t allowed to accept payment for their services. They&#39;re appointed to carry out a community duty, not to just sit smugly on a title,&quot; says Mr Worth.</p>
<p>&quot;The Justice Minister must look into this. It&#39;s estimated that only about 400 of the 1800 JPs in the Auckland region are diligent in their duties - doing such tasks as document certification, issuing search warrants and the judicial duties of appointment to Court panels.</p>
<p>&quot;The work of a JP is critical and I&#39;m appalled that some won&#39;t perform their ministerial tasks unless they receive payment,&quot; says Mr Worth.</p>
<p>&quot;If they&#39;re not prepared to fully take on the role, they should resign.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe the prospect of a change to the law resulting in closer scrutiny of JPs&#39; warrants is the answer,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;There are 10-thousand JPs in New Zealand, but unfortunately some are letting down the rest by damaging the institution and an ancient office which dates back to 1361,&quot; says Mr Worth.</p>
