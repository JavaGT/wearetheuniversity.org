<p>Emerging law and economic talent rewarded</p>
<p>The combination of legal analysis and economic alacrity will be rewarded tomorrow evening in a presentation of prize-winning essays by third year law and economics students.</p>
<p>This inaugural event, run by Victoria’s School of Law and School of Economics and Finance, recognises up-and-coming students in the relatively new discipline of joint law and economics study.</p>
<p>One of four student finalists will receive a $500 first prize in the Students on Show event, sponsored by the New Zealand Institute for the Study of Competition and Regulation, based at Victoria University.</p>
<p>Senior Lecturer Judy Kavanagh, School of Economics and Finance, says the winner will be announced at the prize giving ceremony on Thursday, 10 July.</p>
<p>“The essay topics illustrate the wide range of issues that are susceptible to law and economics analysis,” says Ms Kavanagh.</p>
<p>“Each student has shown an impressive depth of understanding of the law and economics approach in their work.”</p>
<p>“This event provides industry leaders and the legal fraternity with a wonderful opportunity to see what these students can do,” she says.</p>
<p>The class of 65 students were given three essay topics to choose from, or could propose their own in consultation with their lecturer. A long list of 10 essays was selected and reduced down to four.</p>
<p>The four students and their essay topics (abstracts attached) are: Simon Brett (own topic) – ACC: An Efficient Solution to Tort Liability? David Carter (own topic) – Unbundling the Local Loop: Consumer Welfare Effects. Jason Nichols (own topic) – Could Government Intervention Solve the Power Crisis? Richard Robinson (assigned topic) – Vertical Restraints and their Effect on Competition.</p>

<p>Mark Berry, barrister and former Commerce Commission Deputy Chair will officiate at the prize-giving. Sir Ivor Richardson – a Distinguished Fellow at the School of Law – will present the prizes. Industry leaders from Wellington business and legal professions have been invited to attend.</p>
<p>Work done by New Zealand Institute for the Study of Competition and Regulation feeds into course work of the third-year Law and Economics paper.</p>
<p>Prizes will be awarded on Thursday, 10 July between 6 - 6.45pm in Lecture Theatre 3, School of Law, Government Buildings, Lambton Quay.  </p>
