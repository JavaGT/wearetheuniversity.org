<p>Milk For Schools Should Continue</p>
<p>New Zealand First’s family affairs spokesperson Barbara Stewart says she fully supports the Hawkes Bay District Health Boards milk-in-schools programme and hopes that other District Health Boards will follow suit.</p>
<p>The Hawkes Bay District Health Board is trialing a programme supplying daily milk to the children in a local primary school.</p>
<p>“It would be a worthwhile programme for other DHBs to start, particularly in low decile schools,” said Mrs Stewart.</p>
<p>“It can only be beneficial to the health and well being of the young students.</p>
<p>“If we can teach children the benefits of a regular intake of milk in their daily diet then perhaps we can stop these children having health problems further down the line.</p>
<p>“Research has shown that children who do not drink milk regularly are more likely to suffer from obesity. Any measure that promotes a more balanced diet is to be recommended.</p>
<p>“I can only praise the Hawkes Bay District Health Board for their initiative and suggest that other DHBs look at similar programmes,” said Mrs Stewart.</p>
