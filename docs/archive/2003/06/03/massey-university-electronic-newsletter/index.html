<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Judith Kinnear says comments by Associate Education Minister (Tertiary) Steve Maharey on continuing informal talks between Massey and Lincoln Universities are encouraging and helpful. The Minister says the talks, on possible co-operation in land-based and related programmes, are consistent with tertiary education policy of seeking more collaboration between institutions.</p>
<p>New research on the employment expectations of older workers will help guide Government policy. The College of Business research report was launched by the Minister of Labour Margaret Wilson in Wellington. She said it addresses critical issues relating to New Zealand&#39;s ageing workforce, and provides the Government with timely information.</p>
<p>The first university-linked, campus-based, pre-incubator think-tank has been launched at Albany. The e-centre StartUp project will help nurture raw ideas from researchers, students and business people, including partner, the Tindall Foundation&#39;s &#39;ideas.org&#39;.</p>
<p>Professor Allan Rae will play a lead role in a new research project on Asian development - especially in China. He is part of a research consortium that has won a $1.5million grant from the Foundation of Research, Science and Technology.</p>

<p>The idea of &#39;road rage&#39; is common but the &#39;fearful&#39; driver remains relatively unknown. Research by psychologist Dr Joanne Taylor, based on driving phobias, shows that that although fears related to driving have been studied largely as a consequence of motor vehicle accidents, there are indications that driving fears stem from other factors. It showed a similar level of fear amongst drivers who had had accidents and those who had not.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t leave town without seeing the country, was Richard Taylor&#39;s message to graduating design students in Wellington. Speaking at the Design, Fine Arts and Music graduation ceremony, the Weta Digital Effects wizard said many creative opportunities are now unfolding in Wellington and throughout New Zealand.</p>
<p>Waitangi Fisheries Commission chief executive Robin Hape says the Maori economy is poised for rapid growth as the Treaty settlement process heads into its sunset phase, but a shortage of qualified business people could stymie that.  </p>
