<p>Simon Power MP National Party Defence Spokesman</p>

<p>Real results needed from Australian defence talks</p>
<p>The National Party says the Government needs to get tangible results from defence talks in Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;Australia is our most important ally, its crucial to regional security that we work together with our neighbours,&quot; says National Party Defence spokesman Simon Power.</p>
<p>He&#39;s commenting on the upcoming annual meeting between Defence Minister Mark Burton and his Australian counterpart Senator Robert Hill.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour may think we&#39;re operating in a &#39;benign defence environment&#39;, it&#39;s clear from the recent defence commitments in the Australian budget that they don&#39;t share the same view,&quot; says Mr Power.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Party is eager to see results from these talks.</p>
<p>&quot;They should include cast iron assurances about interoperability.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re also keen to learn whether there&#39;s still a place for New Zealand in joint exercises, given reports that the US is poised to base thousands of troops in Australia,&quot; Mr Power says.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s critical that Mark Burton repair some of the damage done to a relationship that&#39;s soured in recent times.</p>
<p>&quot;The annual talks have never been more important,&quot; says Mr Power.</p>
<p>&quot;With the US signalling increased security in the Pacific, New Zealand must speak with a clear, consistent voice.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no more room for wild swings in our foreign and defence policies.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand must be a reliable partner, that is prepared to pull its weight,&quot; he says.</p>
