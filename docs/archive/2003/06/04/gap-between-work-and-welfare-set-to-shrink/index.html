<p>Katherine Rich MP<br>National Party Welfare Spokesperson</p>

<p>Gap between work and welfare set to shrink</p>
<p>All Kiwis should be deeply concerned by the Government&#39;s plan to erode the income gap between work and welfare still further, according to National Party Welfare spokesperson Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey&#39;s being forced to trot out the same ideas he had while in Opposition.</p>
<p>&quot;Now into his fourth year as Minister, it&#39;s a bit late in the piece to start talking about future plans,&quot; Mrs Rich says.</p>
<p>&quot;One would have thought that this sort of work had been started years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey&#39;s talking about making it easier for beneficiaries to navigate what he describes as a &#39;labyrinth&#39; of top-ups in the welfare system,&quot; Mrs Rich says.</p>
<p>&quot;The translation is that Labour wants to make it easier for beneficiaries to get money without mentioning any new focus on helping them back to work.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a startling admission from the Minister that the system he fights so desperately to protect is failing,&quot; says Mrs Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#39;s admitted there&#39;s been massive growth in special benefits up from 7000 to 32,000, meanwhile the cost of special benefits has climbed from $31 million in 1999 to more than $80 million this year,&quot; says Mrs Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;The special benefit is supposed to be for extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<p>&quot;It has become an &#39;ordinary&#39; rather than a &#39;special&#39; benefit under Labour.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s more proof the Government has been hiding the true size of the country&#39;s welfare problem.</p>

<p>&quot;If the income gap between work and welfare continues to close, one of the major incentives for someone to find employment will be undermined,&quot; Mrs Rich says.</p>
<p>&quot;National believes that work is the only true ticket out of poverty. &quot;This Government has written off the hundreds of thousands of people on welfare as hopeless cases, it must start offering them new opportunities.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand taxpayers deserve better and so do beneficiaries,&quot; Mrs Rich says.</p>
