<p><strong>Wednesday, 4 June 2003, 11:57 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Gerry Brownlee MP National Party Energy Spokesman</p>
<p>04 June 2003</p>
<p>Should NZ taxpayers fund Aussie investment?</p>
<p>The National Party&#39;s appalled by fresh suggestions that state-owned Meridian Energy is looking at a multi-million dollar expansion into Australian wind farms.</p>
<p>&quot;How can the Government justify the emergency $200 million tax for future power generation, when its own company is spending more than $1.2 billion across the Tasman?&quot; asks National Party Energy spokesman Gerry Brownlee.</p>
<p>&quot;The New Zealand taxpayer will not accept this &#39;empire building&#39; the Government should not accept it either.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Government lets this go ahead Meridian will have more than $1.2 billion invested in Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;Meridian says it plans to be a &#39;serious player&#39; in the Australian market, but surely New Zealand needs the Government-owned generator to focus on issues much closer to home.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not as if the Government didn&#39;t know what was going on,&quot; says Mr Brownlee.</p>
<p>&quot;In March this year the company announced it was spending $640 million on hydro power stations in Victoria, and as far back as 2001 Meridian was investing in Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;We questioned that spending this year, but it&#39;s a familiar story in the electricity sector, the Government failed to take any action,&quot; Mr Brownlee says.</p>
