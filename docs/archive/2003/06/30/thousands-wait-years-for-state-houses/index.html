<p>Wayne Mapp National Housing Spokesperson</p>

<p>Thousands wait years for state houses</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s policy of income related rents on state housing is feeding a huge and growing waiting list for state houses, says National Housing Spokesperson Dr Wayne Mapp.</p>
<p>&quot;Thousands of people are waiting for state houses and most don&#39;t have a hope of getting into one for years, because the Government has raised expectations that everyone who wants a state house can get into one.</p>
<p>Dr Mapp was responding to briefing papers to the new Minister of Housing which show 4200 people are waiting on Housing New Zealand&#39;s high need waiting list when there&#39;s just 746 vacant houses.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government doesn&#39;t recognise that it should be selling state houses to long-term tenants in order to free up money that could build new houses for those in genuine need.</p>
<p>&quot;In state housing there should always be a mechanism encouraging people to move on and buy their own home, but the Government&#39;s ideology against selling state houses is blinding it to sensible practical solutions.</p>
<p>&quot;The effect is it is drawing more and more people into state housing, creating a never ending demand that it can&#39;t meet,&quot; Dr Mapp said.</p>
