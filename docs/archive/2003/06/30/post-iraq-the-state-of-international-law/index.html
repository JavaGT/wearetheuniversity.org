<p>MEDIA RELEASE 30 June 2003</p>
<p>Post-Iraq: The State Of International Law</p>
<p>The state of international law post the invasion of Iraq and overthrow of Saddam Hussein&#39;s regime is the focus of the inaugural lecture by Victoria University Professor Campbell McLachlan.</p>
<p>Professor McLachlan, who joined Victoria in April and as Professor of International Law and Deputy Dean of the Faculty of Law, will give his lecture, After Baghdad: Conflict or Coherence in International Law? at the University&#39;s School of Law on July 2.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll take recent events as a spring-board to open up a broader debate about the fragmentation of international law; the ways in which different values in the multilateral system can come into conflict with each other; and what, if anything, we can do about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor McLachlan, who graduated with a First Class Honours degree in law from Victoria in 1983, returns to his alma mater after a high profile career in law in London.</p>
<p>After graduating, Professor McLachlan headed to Europe where he completed a Diploma cum laude from the Hague Academy of International Law in 1985 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of London in 1988.</p>
<p>He then practised in the field of international law and was a partner in the firm of Herbert Smith and Head of its International Law Practice Group. He was also a member of the Law Faculty of the University of Cambridge, taught at the University of London and was Joint Honorary Secretary of the British Branch of the International Law Association.</p>
