<p>No honour or profit in Thai trade deal</p>
<p>A free trade deal with Thailand would fly in the face of the very principles that the Labour Party was founded on, Green Party Co-leader Rod Donald said today.</p>
<p>&quot;I am amazed that the Government is even contemplating the possibility of entering into a &#39;closer economic partnership&#39; with a country that has such an appalling record in child labour and the abuse of workers&#39; rights,&quot; Rod Donald said.</p>
<p>He was commenting on an announcement today from Trade Minister Jim Sutton that New Zealand and Thailand would conduct a scoping study on a closer economic partnership</p>
<p>Mr Donald noted that the ILO 2001 yearbook reported 173,000 children between 13-14 years and almost two million children between 15-19 were working.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a US State Department report last year found that the official Thai minimum wage was not adequate to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family, and that migrants and children were working for wages that were significantly lower than the minimum wage.</p>
<p>&quot;Wiping out tariff protection for New Zealand clothing manufacturers will simultaneously boost the number of Thai sweatshops and doom thousands of New Zealand workers,&quot; Rod Donald said.</p>
<p>&quot;How can New Zealand manufacturers compete on such a distorted playing field? The simple answer is: they can&#39;t.</p>
<p>&quot;We recorded a $200 million trade deficit with Thailand in the last calendar year. Why open our borders further to goods produced at the expense of workers&#39; human rights and a nation&#39;s environment?</p>
<p>&quot;This Government appears to have a severe case of free-trade lunacy. I suggest Jim Sutton takes a dose of reality and starts doing something that will really pay this country an economic and environmental dividend, like staying at home and sorting out our biosecurity problems.&quot;</p>
