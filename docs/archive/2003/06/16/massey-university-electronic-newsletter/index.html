<p><strong>Issue: 9. 16 June, 2003 News Briefs</strong></p>
<p>The roles of men and women in New Zealand society are covered in the latest International Social Survey Programme conducted by the University&#39;s Department of Marketing. Led by Professor Phil Gendall, the survey represents New Zealand&#39;s contribution to the programme, which involves leading academic institutions in 38 countries in an annual survey of economic and social policy issues.</p>
<p>The first substantial research on amphetamine type drugs is about to start. The Office of the Commissioner of Police has awarded the Centre for Social and Health Outcomes Research Evaluation (SHORE) $150,000 to investigate the impact of the increased use of ATS drugs in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Judith Kinnear says there are complications with the fees maxima set in the Government&#39;s budget. The shift to a new system, from a &#39;fees freeze&#39;, will require detailed modelling and analysis.</p>
<p>The Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health has secured more than $1.6 million in the latest FRST funding round. Projects will include research to develop high quality pork products for export and products to support the dairy goat export industry.</p>
<p>Two high-profile practitioners in the College of Design, Fine Arts and Music received New Zealand Order of Merit awards in the Queen&#39;s Birthday Honours list. They are senior lecturer Anne Noble, for services to photography, and lecturer Rodger Fox, for services to music. Seven Massey alumni were also honoured.</p>
<p>Pre-eminent sleep expert Professor Philippa Gander has published a groundbreaking new book, Sleep in the 24-Hour Society. The idea for the study came while she was researching flight crew fatigue for NASA. Professor Gander has spent years researching problems associated with flight crews working through the night, affected by jet lag.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial behaviour are the focus of a new book initiated and co-edited by Professor Anne de Bruin, department of Commerce, working with sociologist Dr Ann Dupuis. Professor de Bruin says world research in the field is still young and limited - and this is the first academic work on the subject in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Maui&#39;s dolphin, on the brink. A Hector&#39;s, or Maui&#39;s, dolphin was found washed up on O&#39;Neils Beach, Auckland, in early June and an autopsy found it died from chronic pneumonia. Massey marine mammal expert Dr Padraig Duignan says pneumonia in New Zealand dolphins is rare and even more rare is the fungus Aspergillus, which appears to have caused the pneumonia.</p>
<p>Three Deputy Vice-Chancellors are to be appointed, to replace the roles of campus Principal. The positions at Palmerston North and Albany are expected to be filled by the end of the year, with Professor Ken Heskin filling the Wellington D V-C role. In the meantime, Professor Ian Watson, who retires this year, will act as head of the Albany campus and Professor Ken Milne will be acting head of the Palmerston North campus.</p>
