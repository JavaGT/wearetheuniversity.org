<p><strong>Monday, 16 June 2003, 10:01 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Professor appointed to head School of Accounting and Commercial Law</p>
<p>Chartered Accountant and academic, Professor Brenda Porter, begins today (16 June) as the new Head of Victoria University&#39;s School of Accounting and Commercial Law.</p>
<p>Professor Porter returns to New Zealand from her most recent position as Reader in Accounting at the Warwick Business School - one of the top three business schools in the UK.</p>
<p>Prior to that she was Director of Accounting Research at Cranfield School of Management, Cranfield University, one of Western Europe’s largest academic centres for strategic and applied research.</p>
<p>Between 1991 and 1998, Professor Porter was Professor of Accounting at Massey University.</p>
<p>In announcing the appointment, Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh, says Professor Porter will make a strong contribution to the research programme of the School, particularly building on the work already under way in the Centre for Accounting, Governance and Taxation Research.</p>
<p>“Professor Porter has wide-ranging teaching experience at all levels including MBA teaching and PhD supervision,” says Professor Walsh.</p>
<p>“This will enable her to take a leadership role in the further development of the strong teaching programmes in the School of Accounting and Commercial Law.</p>
<p>“Her appointment will also build on the School&#39;s close relationships with the accounting and commercial law professions.”</p>
<p>Professor Walsh says her research interests focus on the role of auditing in securing responsible governance, a particularly important issue in the wake of the USA Enron scandal.</p>
<p>Professor Porter is the author of several accounting-related books and numerous refereed articles. She replaces Associate Professor Yvonne Van Roy, who has completed her term, as Head of School.  </p>
