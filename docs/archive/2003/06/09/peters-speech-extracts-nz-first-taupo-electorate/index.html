<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters - Extracts from a speech to the New Zealand First Taupo Electorate AGM, St Andrews Anglican Church Hall 2pm Sunday 8 June 2003</p>
<p>“There is no greater sin than ingratitude” There is a saying that tact is the art of making a point without making an enemy.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and her cabinet should learn this.</p>
<p>They would do all New Zealanders a great favour if they kept out of international affairs for the rest of the term of this government.</p>
<p>In fact, an overseas travel ban should be slapped on them all unless it is a one-way ticket to somewhere with no communications.</p>
<p>In recent months Helen Clark has ripped up the textbook on diplomacy and Phil Goff, usually a thoughtful foreign affairs minister, decided to walk in public holding hands with Yasser Arafat.</p>
<p>Now, we believe in a fair deal for the Palestinians – but holding hands with the PLO? It is a form of symbolism that will not escape observers.</p>
<p>Our foreign policy this year has taken us closer to Germany and France and further away from the United States and Britain – our traditional allies, close friends and trading partners.</p>
<p>This change also risks alienating Australia, historically our closest friend, trading partner and home to hundreds of thousands of our people. The number is growing all the time.</p>
<p>Helen Clark has been dismissive of Australia because of that country’s participation in the invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Government disagreed with that operation conducted outside the auspices of the United Nations as it was entitled to do so.</p>

<p>But after stating her position, Helen Clark should not have made derogatory statements about free trade and Australia.</p>
<p>New Zealanders and Australians have died together on foreign fields for nearly ninety years.</p>
<p>Although we compete on sporting fields, we uphold the same traditional values of democracy and freedom.</p>
<p>There are so many New Zealanders in Australia that we are related to each other. Call us cousins if you like.</p>
<p>Maori stand tall in Australia, once they move away from the shroud of the Treaty.</p>
<p>Away from political correctness and cargo cultism they become achievers and many reach top positions in a number of professions.</p>
<p>We should regard Australia with affection. That country is in some ways like a kindly uncle taking in nieces and nephews, and providing prospects that do not exist at home in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It therefore behoves the Prime Minister and her cabinet to treat Australia with courtesy and respect.</p>
<p>The bad mouthing should stop and they should stop behaving like some ungrateful relation – one who can’t look after their own young people.</p>
<p>As well as our historical ties of friendship and good-natured rivalry, New Zealand and Australia are strong trading partners.</p>
<p>Australia is New Zealand’s biggest market. We have a free trade agreement going back many years – long before these arrangements were fashionable.</p>
<p>So, despite the Ocker jokes we really are good mates with the Aussies and most New Zealanders, except some in the Beehive, want to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Our reminder to the Prime Minister is this. Australia, the United States and Britain are our friends.</p>
<p>Friends can disagree and remain committed to each other as long as they respect the other’s point of view.</p>
<p>They don’t talk behind backs and they don’t make discourteous remarks in public.</p>
<p>It’s time for tact and diplomacy – and hopefully that will mean silence from certain quarters for the next few months.  </p>
