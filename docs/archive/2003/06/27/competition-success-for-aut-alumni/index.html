<p>In the nationwide public relations awards this year, Auckland University of Technology alumni won two of the eight awards and were highly commended in five categories.</p>
<p>Winner of the young PRINZ practitioner of the year was Leah Howitt (BCS 2002) of Empire Events. Joint winner of the Marketing PR category was Simone Bell (BCS 2000) of Network PR. Other Communication Studies graduates who were highly commended across the eight categories of the awards were:</p>
<p>Karen Bradshaw,</p>
<p>Dee Crooks,</p>
<p>Sally Frewin,</p>
<p>Rosalie Norris,</p>
<p>Mark Street, Strahan Wallis and Nikki Wright.</p>
<p>They were honoured by the Public Relations Institute of New Zealand at its 2003 Awards Dinner in June.</p>
<p>On another current award platform, Sheryl Jacobi, (GradDip Communication/PR from AUT) won one of the seven global awards for Tourism NZ staff. Sheryl¹s award was presented at the annual conference for Tourism NZ representative from all over the world. The citation recognised her ³100% Pure NZ² campaign efforts over the America¹s Cup period.</p>
<p>Programme and curriculum leader, Joseph Peart, said: ³I got a great kick out of phoning each of them (the AUT alumni) and reminding them that I had told them as students they were the Œcrème de la crème¹. They have lived up to our expectations and demonstrated their ability in the best practice of their profession.²  </p>
