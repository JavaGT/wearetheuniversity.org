<p>Catherine Judd Speech: Launch of Liberal Thinking</p>
<p>Tonight&#39;s book launch continues the process in establishing our rightful claim to the word &#39;liberal&#39;.</p>
<p>And that process is successful.</p>
<p>You can tell when you&#39;re having an impact by the vitriol of your opponents.</p>
<p>Socialists and collectivists have a blind spot towards the word &#39;liberal&#39;.</p>
<p>They think it should be theirs, but are uncomfortable with its true meaning - freedom.</p>
<p>One such opponent wrote to the NZ Herald and fumed that ACT has no business calling itself a liberal party because it is &quot;somewhere to the right of Genghis (Gengis) Khan&quot;.</p>
<p>With such muddleheaded logic such as that I know we can rely on ACT members - who have a wide-ranging interest in political philosophy - to spring into action.</p>
<p>Our writers of letters to the editor are legendary. They did not let such a slur go unchallenged.</p>
<p>Reuben Chapple wrote from Whangarei and said,</p>
<p>To label Act &quot;right wing&quot; for promoting free markets and limited government merely proves that demonising opponents is far easier than actually engaging with their ideas. This tactic is so old that it creaks.</p>
<p>And that,</p>
<p>If Ghengis Khan were alive today, he&#39;d undoubtedly be a coercive state socialist rather than an adherent of Act&#39;s classical liberal model that asserts and promotes the primacy of the individual, the rule of law, and private property rights.</p>
<p>And Scott Dennison joined in and said,</p>
<p>To suggest that ACT, a liberal party that promotes freedom, choice and personal responsibility is further right on the spectrum than New Zealand First...is a joke.</p>
<p>And finally, as Lindsay Mitchell pointed out,</p>
<p>ACT is the only party in parliament consistently pushing for less government, less regulation, greater individual responsibility and rights. These aspirations are entirely consistent with the term &#39;liberal&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t have said it better myself. You can always rely on ACT members to put the record straight.</p>
<p>And there&#39;s another sign that our claim on &#39;liberal&#39; has taken root. In last week&#39;s Independent Chris Trotter, in talking about the government&#39;s tertiary reforms, said they should be opposed by socialists and &quot;classical liberals&quot;.</p>
<p>At this morning&#39;s Caucus meeting Richard read an extract from Rodney&#39;s chapter in the book that really says it all.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentleman please welcome a man who never hesitates to state his position boldly, ACT Leader the Honourable Richard Prebble.  </p>
