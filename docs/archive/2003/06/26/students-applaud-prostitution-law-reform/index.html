<p>Students applaud prostitution law reform</p>
<p>Students are applauding the passage of prostitution reform legislation last night.</p>
<p>&quot;User pays in education has unfortunately encouraged more students into sex work to support themselves through their studies,&quot; said Camilla Belich, National Women&#39;s Rights Officer for the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>&quot;While we have yet to see big improvements in student support provisions, we are pleased that those who have had to enter sex work will now enjoy the same rights and protections as other workers.&quot;</p>
<p>Belich says the national women&#39;s student forum, the Tertiary Women&#39;s Focus Group, would like to extend its congratulations to Tim Barnett, the MPs who supported the Bill in Parliament, and to the New Zealand Prostitutes Collective who have lobbied so effectively for change.</p>
<p>&quot;We think that Parliament has made a historical step towards improving women&#39;s rights and towards social responsibility. It is about time we started to address the realities of the world we live in.&quot;</p>
