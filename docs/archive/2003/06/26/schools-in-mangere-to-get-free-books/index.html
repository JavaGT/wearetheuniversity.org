<p><strong>Thursday, 26 June 2003, 3:03 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Schools in Mangere to get free books</p>
<p>Labour MP for Mangere, Hon Taito Phillip Field, is pleased that the Government is funding free books to schools in Mangere as part of the Books in Homes Programme.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Mr Field attended both Mangere Central Primary School and Mangere East Primary School to present the schools with some of the free books and books funded by local businesses that were enthusiastically received and appreciated by the children and teachers.</p>
<p>This is the ninth year in a row that the Ministry of Education has provided funding for the literacy programme, which aims to break the cycle of &#39;booklessness&#39; for children in low decile schools.</p>
<p>&quot;Encouraging kids to see reading as fun is an important step in improving their literacy skills. Getting the foundations right early on is an essential key to a life-long career in learning,&quot; Mr Field said.</p>
<p>Each student at one of the 426 schools in the Books in Homes Programme gets five free books a year, funded by the ministry, private sponsors and schools.</p>
<p>This week&#39;s book offer is funded by the Ministry of Education. Children can choose from 50 popular fiction and non-fiction books on offer.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Council for Educational Research evaluation into the literacy aspects of the programme, released in January 2002, show positive returns for all participants.</p>
<p>As well as changing reading habits and attitudes, reading scores of students in the school sample were significantly greater in 2001 compared to 1996 scores.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is committed to reducing under-achievement and it is great that schools in Mangere are benefiting from this programme.&quot;</p>
