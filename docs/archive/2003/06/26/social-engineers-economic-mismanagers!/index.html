<p><strong>Thursday, 26 June 2003, 10:28 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Social Engineers - Economic Mismanagers!</p>
<p>New Zealand First has called on the Government to provide more economic leadership and to focus less on its politically correct social engineering agenda.</p>
<p>“While Labour concentrates on prostitution, gender bending, racial discrimination, mass immigration and manipulating the legal system, the lack of economic vision is leading to a economic decline that threatens to match the social and cultural confusion being created,” said leader Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“The lack of an export policy, the continued running down of the country’s infrastructure, the increasing inclination of our educational institutions to pander to the needs of transient foreign money-bringing students at the expense of the basic skills of our own youth, the ideological position taken against tax incentives for research, development and export industries, and a disastrous domestic savings and investment record are exacerbated by a ‘follow the leader’ monetary policy that tracks our major trading partners from a position of competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p>“While this Government congratulates itself on leading the world in political correctness, red tape and social decay it is mismanaging our economy to an alarming degree.</p>
<p>“Rather than boosting the sex industry, pretending that women are men and telling us to hug immigrants, the Government should be working on an economic vision that will help lift living standards and provide some sort of future for our young people, “ Mr. Peters said.  </p>
