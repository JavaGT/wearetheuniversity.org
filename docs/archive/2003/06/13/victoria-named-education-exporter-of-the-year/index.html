<p><strong>Friday, 13 June 2003, 10:55 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Victoria University&#39;s standing as the destination of choice for international students was confirmed last night when the University was named Education Exporter of the Year.</p>
<p>Victoria&#39;s success in the Trade New Zealand Awards, announced in Christchurch last night, follows the University being named as a finalist in its category for two years in a row.</p>
<p>Overseas student numbers increased from 1,456 in 2001 to 1,947 in 2002, with foreign earnings growing from $10.17 million to $17.3 million over the same period.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon said the award was the result of a concerted and strategic marketing campaign. While Victoria delivers degree programmes and short-term programmes to students from 75 countries, the majority of its international student body come from selected key countries.</p>
<p>“We actively market in only 13 countries. We are focused in the way in which we develop current and emerging markets, and plan very carefully entry into new markets. Our developed markets are China, Singapore and Malaysia, and our strong emerging markets are India, Korea and the USA.</p>
<p>“We are seeing continued strong growth out of China and the United States. Whereas a few years ago it was Australia, New Zealand is now the new hot ticket for study abroad experiences for US and Northern European students. We are also seeing really encouraging signs of growth from India, Japan and Korea.”</p>
<p>Professor McCutcheon said Korea had become an increasingly important source of international students after the university won a three-year contract with Chosun University. This sees at least 100 students come to Victoria University annually to complete a tailored 18-week intensive English language and academic programme.</p>

<p>International education is a very competitive industry, and Professor McCutcheon said Victoria worked hard to set itself apart from competitors.</p>
<p>“Wellington and Victoria have unique selling features and benefits and those are the sorts of elements we are building on in our marketing – especially the unique relationship between business, government, the wider public sector and academia in a modern and dynamic city.”</p>
<p>Professor McCutcheon said the University&#39;s commitment to providing quality academic support and pastoral care for international students saw it being one of the first institutions recognised as being compliant with the new Code of Practice introduced by the Ministry of Education.</p>
