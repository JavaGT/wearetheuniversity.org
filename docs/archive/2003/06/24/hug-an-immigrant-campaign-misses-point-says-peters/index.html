<p>Hug An Immigrant Campaign Misses Point Says Peters</p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters says the Government’s policy of mass immigration is the real cause of resentment towards immigrants and the advertising campaign starting tomorrow is a waste of time and effort.</p>
<p>Mr Peters said the campaign is designed to shut down the real issues that should be debated such as the changing ethnic and cultural landscape of New Zealand and the effects of bringing huge numbers of mainly Asian people into Auckland.</p>
<p>“It is foolish to try to brainwash New Zealanders that it is good for them to bring in over 70,000 immigrants a year from different cultures. It is impossible for a small country, with only four million people, to absorb numbers like that without serious disruption.</p>
<p>“Instead of welcoming an advertising campaign to tell people what to think, the Government and its thought police at the Human Rights Commission should be listening to New Zealanders and controlling immigration.</p>
<p>“Our secondary schools and tertiary institutions are increasingly tailoring their courses for ‘foreign visitors’ so they can earn more dollars; our health and social services are straining under the weight of third world demands; our transport infrastructure is buckling under the pressures of mass immigration; and, many New Zealanders can no longer afford to buy houses in some of our cities, and the Government wonders why New Zealanders are concerned!</p>
<p>“New Zealanders are not racists. They are simply reacting to the evidence of their eyes and ears and expressing concern that the Government has decided to make New Zealand an Asian colony,” said Mr Peters.  </p>
