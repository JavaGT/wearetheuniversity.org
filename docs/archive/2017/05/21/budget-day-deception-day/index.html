<p><strong>Sunday, 21 May 2017, 2:03 pm</strong><br><strong>Speech: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Budget day/deception day</strong></p>
<p>Next Thursday is Budget Day when Steven Joyce will seek to Trump Bill English in smoke and mirrors.<br>A credible Budget will have three features.</p>
<p>First, it will provide an honest accounting of how the New Zealand economy and government finances are really doing.</p>
<p>Second, it will explain how there is a surplus after addressing all the reasonable demands that need money spent on them.</p>
<p>Third, it will set out a pathway that will deliver real prosperity and security for all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>By those standards this Thursday’s budget will be an abject failure!</p>
<p>The chasm between rhetoric and reality in our economy will be as clear as day.</p>
<p>Underneath the hype and misinformation will be a “fake” Budget that delivers little that is meaningful for ordinary New Zealanders.</p>
<p>There will be the usual political parcels fluffed up to look substantial, as though they will make a difference.</p>
<p>But will they survive scrutiny?</p>
<p>Let’s start by putting a few facts on the table. Including the inconvenient facts that don’t fit the “everything is rosy” spin.</p>
<p>1. Nearly 5% or 130,000 New Zealanders were officially without a job.</p>
<p>2. The government’s boast of GDP growth of 3% is bogus - the bulk of that is from a 2% annual population growth</p>
<p>3. New Zealand’s productivity is low – well below better performing OECD countries and way behind Australia.</p>
<p>4. The economy is fundamentally unbalanced. National has done nothing to address the chronic balance of payments deficit which is $7 billion.</p>
<p>5. New Zealand remains massively indebted to the rest of world – with a net international liability of $156 billion.</p>
<p>6. The relentless flogging off of New Zealand goes on. According to the Overseas Investment Office 466,000 hectares of land was sold to offshore buyers in 2016 - five times more than the previous year.<br>Let’s turn to tax cuts – a seductive notion.</p>
<p>The government has been teasing the public with the prospect of tax cuts through many of its previous Budgets.</p>
<p>The public is fed on a diet of “some day, one day” tax cuts will happen.</p>
<p>But being election year just dangling possible cuts is not enough.</p>
<p>This year they have to deliver something – or face a total loss of credibility.</p>
<p>No one wants to pay more tax than necessary – and with many struggling even a few dollars will seem appealing.</p>
<p>But the public is entitled to honest answers on what the true costs of any tax cut is.</p>
<p>We know that the so-called surplus, which is the pretext for a tax cut, is “a creature of creative accounting”.<br>The Government will tout its Budget surplus.<br>This is supposed to be the real barometer of prudent public finance.<br>Remember what we said, the government will have to explain how there is a surplus after addressing all the reasonable demands that need money spent on them<br>If this Thursday’s Budget does not do that then claims of a surplus will be without credibility, plausibility or integrity.<br>Some may be taken in but not people who think about what the Government is really up to.<br>Read the news, day in, day out, year in, year out, of critical areas lacking funding.<br>You all know there is deliberate under funding of many public services, including health, education and police.<br>We could recite a very long list that includes children in overcrowded schools being taught in corridors and sick people waiting years for the specialist medical treatment they urgently need.<br>Hospitals around the country are struggling to cope with an influx of patients – with DHBs in serious deficit – in Whangarei a Northland man waited six days, all day every day, to have a broken ankle attended to.<br>Almost on a weekly basis doctors and health professionals are warning of health services on the edge of collapse.<br>These conditions are a direct result of government conjuring up a surplus irrespective of the cost inflicted on society and the environment.</p>
<p>There are many other issues and areas where the funding deficit is doing serious damage, for example;</p>
<p>• Poverty</p>
<p>• Mental health services</p>
<p>• Conservation</p>
<p>• Housing</p>
<p>To say nothing of stopping contributions into the NZ Super Fund to assist with the future costs of retirement.</p>
<p>If the government was paying into the NZ Super Fund there would be no surplus – and how come commentators can’t get that simple fact?</p>
<p><strong>Honest Government</strong></p>
<p>Record net immigration at almost 72,000 per year will render the numbers in this Thursday’s Budget meaningless.</p>
<p>Budgets that take no account of rapid population growth are next to useless.</p>
<p>Any government can get “growth” by mass immigration.</p>
<p>Question: Why stop at net almost 72,000 new immigrants a year?</p>
<p>Why not net 170,000 a year?</p>
<p>Or further yet why not 270,000?</p>
<p>Think of it – then the government could boast that NZ has the highest economic growth rate in the world.</p>
<p>All three scenarios are ridiculous.</p>
<p>But this government will not come clean – and adjust its Budget numbers to growth per capita, that is, GDP growth per person.</p>
<p>National remains addicted to a reckless and irresponsible immigration policy.</p>
<p>And this Budget won’t address that.</p>
<p>Mind you, isn’t it amazing how all of a sudden so many politicians and observers have discovered we have an immigration problem?  </p>
<p><strong>Housing Affordability</strong></p>
<p>But National, rather than address it, continues with an absurd open door immigration policy and offshore buying to further fuel this crisis.</p>
<p>Until immigration is drastically reduced any claims that politicians are serious about the housing crisis is just hot air – babble to conceal their real agenda.</p>
<p>We’ll be releasing our housing policy for this election very shortly. It is realistic, based on the needs of New Zealanders now and into the near future. It will be accompanied by a construction programme and financing provisions to make these policies real.</p>
<p>Unlike the rest, we are going to build houses for people not the “market”.</p>
<p><strong>Foreign Ownership</strong>  </p>
<p>There will be nothing in this Budget to stop the wholesale sell-off of New Zealand land, businesses, houses and property to overseas ownership.</p>
<p>This government won’t collect data on the true extent of the losses. New Zealand First will.</p>
<p>We will turn the Overseas Investment Office from a toothless poodle into an effective watchdog with real teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Savings</strong>  </p>
<p>There will be nothing in this Budget to boost our savings and reduce our dependence on overseas borrowing.</p>
<p>Four Australian-owned banks dominate our banking sector.</p>
<p>These banks remit billions of profits, dividends and other payments each year creating an enormous drain on our economy and the balance of payments.</p>
<p>But where is our government on this? As usual AWOL - missing in action.</p>
<p>They are totally happy with 95% of the NZ banking system being held overseas. It fits perfectly with their “flog it off” agenda.</p>
<p>Given that NZ is already in net debt to the rest of the world to the tune of $156 billion it is long since time for action on this front.</p>
<p>New Zealand First will start by putting every central and local government account with KiwiBank.</p>
<p><strong>Conservation</strong></p>
<p>Funding must match the task it faces.</p>
<p>Conservation must be for conservation’s sake not just for tourism’s sake.</p>
<p>New Zealand has among the highest proportion of threatened or endangered species – we are talking well over 2000 species on that list.</p>
<p>Again, when you look at conservation underfunding you see how deceitful claims of a surplus are.</p>
<p>Endangered species in New Zealand will be sacrificed just so National can cook the books a bit longer.</p>
<p>If the conservation estate – New Zealand’s treasure – is to be properly protected funding must be seriously increased.  </p>
<p><strong>Climate Change</strong></p>
<p>The government’s track record on taking steps to reduce carbon emissions can be summed up in one word.</p>
<p>Disgraceful!</p>
<p>As the rest of the world moves forward and begins to tackle the great challenge of our time what has been happening in NZ?</p>
<p>NZ is going backwards.</p>
<p>Wellington is scrapping its trolley buses – a sustainable, low carbon form of public transport and replacing them with diesel buses spewing noxious emissions into the city’s streets.</p>
<p>KiwiRail is scrapping its electric locomotives on the North Island Main Trunk Line and replacing them with diesels.</p>
<p>These are staggeringly retrograde steps but they typify this government’s total failure in the area of climate change.</p>
<p><strong>Alfred Ngaro</strong>  </p>
<p>National has become arrogant and dismissive in the way they ply their politics.<br>We should be all grateful that last weekend a National MP exposed the true nature of his party.<br>He said to people getting taxpayer funding, you bag us on the campaign trail and watch out, there won’t be money on the table.<br>He named some of his culprits.<br>The Salvation Army wasn’t playing ball by raising homelessness.<br>Willie Jackson had better look out if he wanted more money for his schools.<br>And beware the media - he accused John Campbell of making up stories of the homeless, as though people holed up in cars had been stage managed.<br>Alfred Ngaro MP was just telling the truth.<br>There are numerous examples.<br>Health Minister Coleman calling critics of his mental health policy a bunch of Lefties.<br>Conservation Minister Barry bad mouthing critics of DOC underfunding.<br><strong>Pike River</strong><br>A contractor drilling holes at Pike River was gagged by his contract.<br>He was instructed to report to Solid Energy if anyone, particularly the media, approached him for information.<br>That’s how the disaster of 29 men dying is being handled.<br><strong>Kaikoura</strong><br>My team went to Kaikoura 11 days ago because of complaints of slow progress on the roads.<br>The NZTA then had the gall to call up the helicopter firm and ask them who hired the aircraft.<br>What business is it of theirs?<br>They are a government appointed body but where is their independence?<br><strong>St John</strong></p>
<p>This week we emailed St John to ask about new crewing proposals from government funding.<br>They wanted to know what the information was for, and copied their email reply to the Health Ministry.<br>This is just like the social housing providers. They were told if they had any media approach they must refer it back to the Ministry.<br>That’s a government starting to behave like the Mafia.<br>These are bullying tactics.<br><strong>Shane Reti</strong><br>In the Northland by-election two years ago Whangarei MP Shane Reti phoned a resident and told her to stop complaining about a dusty road or any funds would dry up. Unfortunately for him she recorded the threat.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Bennett</strong><br>When two solo mums complained about cuts to training incentives Minister Paula Bennett ignored privacy laws by revealing how much those two received in welfare payments and generated a public backlash.<br>That’s vindictiveness at its worst.<br>Paula Bennett got her BA through such an allowance. She gets political power and she scraps the allowance.<br><strong>John Key</strong><br>When the Human Right Commission criticised John Key increasing spy powers, he put the frighteners on them - he threatened to cut their funding.<br><strong>David Seymour</strong><br>Then there’s Act Party’s David Seymour, the MP in Parliament who got in on the coattails of National. He’s a bully too, a small one.<br>Mr Seymour not only visited a school to deter a manager from complaining in writing about policy, he went to his house.<br>He told him not to put his complaints in writing.<br><strong>Community Law</strong><br>In 2014 the Community Law Centre suspected its government funding was withdrawn because it spoke out about legal reform.<br>This followed other community groups saying they were being muzzled by fears that speaking out against government policies would result in losing funding.<br>All these Mafia like, standover tactics belong to another world, or a movie script, not New Zealand.<br>This is not Hollywood. These Ministers are carried away with their sense of importance.<br>These are just some examples of the Born to Rule Blue Brigade.<br>This is the party that has made a thousand cuts to community organisations – Women’s Refuge, Barnados, Presbyterian Support, Relationship Aotearoa, and a $13m cut to Adult Community Education in 2009, to name a few.<br><strong>AUDITOR-GENERAL</strong>  </p>
<p>This week we called for Auditor-General Martin Matthews to be stood down.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>For five years as CEO of the Ministry of Transport he oversaw the work of Joanne Harrison. She is now in jail for stealing $725,000 from the taxpayer.</p>
<p>He conveniently announced his departure from the MOT when charges were being laid against Harrison.</p>
<p>He moved on to a top job as Auditor-General.</p>
<p>His decision making and poor judgement over Harrison’s actions do not make him suitable to fill the role</p>
<p>As CEO for the MOT he had ignored eight warnings from staff that Harrison was a fraudster – she was inventing companies and giving them contracts.</p>
<p>Three of the whistle-blowers lost their jobs during “change” at the Ministry, which Harrison was heavily involved in.</p>
<p>Harrison got her husband a job, and a friend a job.<br>Mr Matthews knew this friend was paid but never turned up to work.<br>He failed to investigate, otherwise he would have followed the dots to Harrison’s deception.</p>
<p>Mr Matthews knew the Australian police were looking for Harrison, two years before she was charged, but did nothing.</p>
<p>Worse, just months before Harrison was charged, we can reveal that Mr Matthews appointed her to run an investigation at the Department of Conservation.</p>
<p>This involved “harassment” issues. So, a fraudster decided on the future of workers at DOC</p>
<p>That report must be now discredited.</p>
<p>Parliament was not told of her lead in the DOC inquiry when it ticked off his appointment as Auditor-General.</p>
<p>Second, we can also reveal his failure to take seriously potential public safety issues involving seven KiwiRail Bridges constructed with prohibited bolts, prone to fatigue and cracking.</p>
<p>It also involves one bridge that was made in China.</p>
<p>Mr Matthews was aware that prohibited bolts were being used.</p>
<p>He took little interest.</p>
<p>These bridges could be a time bomb, we just don’t know when.</p>
<p>Again, that vital attention to detail and being a stickler for accuracy, is what you would expect from the Auditor-General yet here we have two examples that fall well short of that.</p>
<p>Mr Matthews must be stood down pending investigations.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>NZ First does have a comprehensive set of policies to grow the economy in a way that will deliver decent jobs for Kiwis</p>
<p>And that is what NZ First will campaign on all the way to September 23.</p>
<p>NZ First will give New Zealanders a real choice in the 2017 election.</p>
