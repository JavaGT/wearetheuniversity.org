<p><strong>Tuesday, 2 May 2017, 4:12 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong><br>New Zealand First Leader<br>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>2 MAY 2017</p>
<p><strong>MORE NORTHLAND POLICE NEEDED NOW; NOT OVER FOUR YEARS</strong></p>
<p>The epidemic of youth crime hitting Northland was spawned by National failing to put enough police on the ground, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“These young offenders know when police are not out and about,” says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Sixty-six police over four years as promised by Police Minister Paula Bennett will do little. We’ve had eight years of growing crime while National put a freeze on police funds.</p>
<p>“In recent days there’s been the robbery of a <a href="http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11848463">Moerewa</a> butcher’s shop and the vicious bashing of an elderly vintage railway volunteer in <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11848268">Kawakawa</a>.</p>
<p>“These youth do not care, their robbery has almost crippled a small business and they bashed a 78-year-old man.</p>
<p>“Youth know there’s little chance of being caught because there are next to no police on duty to catch them.</p>
<p>“Even if caught, these young crims know they’ll get off lightly. More than 80% of youth offenders do not appear in a formal court.</p>
<p>“The same thing is happening around the country. In <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/otago/92124969/armed-robbery-at-dunedin-dairy">Dunedin</a>, there was a robbery of a dairy at Halfway Bush and every day of the week dairies and liquor stores are being held up and robbed.</p>

<p>“New Zealand First has made a firm pledge to train 1800 more police as soon as possible to combat this lawlessness with 24 hours a day, seven days a week policing,” says Mr Peters.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First Social Development Spokesperson Darroch Ball today lodged a bill in the members’ ballot that will end the ‘cotton wool’ approach to repeat offending.</p>
<p>“The Youth Justice System Demerit Point System Bill is now in the Members’ Bill ballot.</p>
<p>“The Bill will ensure young offenders come before a judge for serious offences, and only have one chance in front of a Youth Court Judge. Any level of offending subsequent to a Youth Court appearance will mean direct referral to a District Court,” says Mr Peters.</p>
