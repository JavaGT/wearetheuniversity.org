<p><strong>Saturday, 13 May 2017, 1:59 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Health of young people a priority for Labour</p>
<p>Labour will ensure all young people have access to a range of health care services on-site at their local secondary school, says Labour’s deputy leader Jacinda Ardern.</p>
<p>“Our policy will see School Based Health Services extended to all public secondary schools to ensure all students have access to a comprehensive youth health service.</p>
<p>“It’s time for fresh thinking so all young Kiwis get the help and support for all their health needs, particularly mental health.</p>
<p>“Evidence around existing services shows where students had more time with on-site health professionals there was significantly less depression and suicide risk.</p>
<p>“Depression and suicide risk were up to two-thirds lower in schools with comprehensive health services. Early intervention works.</p>
<p>“School Based Health Services were introduced by Labour in 2008 but are currently only funded directly for nurses in decile 1-3 public secondary schools, teen parent units and alternative education facilities.</p>
<p>“With this policy the average secondary school will have a full time nurse and also the support of a GP.</p>
<p>“This investment will cost $40 million a year, funded out of Labour’s commitment to reverse National’s $1.7 billion of health cuts.</p>
<p>“Extending comprehensive School Based Health Services to all public secondary schools will benefit hundreds of thousands of young New Zealanders. This is a policy that has the potential to save lives,” says Jacinda Ardern.</p>
