<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>24 May 2017</p>
<p>Overloaded hospitals reach crisis point</p>
<p>The country’s hospitals have reached breaking point with some hospitals discharging patients to free up bed space and patients with serious injuries having to wait hours to be seen by a doctor, says Labour’s Health spokesperson David Clark.</p>
<p>“All the Government could say today after they saw a photograph of a 79 year old man who had to wait nearly six hours to have a serious gash to his face just cleaned and dressed at Middlemore Hospital, was that they had been assured that he had been ‘looked after well’.</p>
<p>“This man who is also a cancer patient had to wait another four more hours just to have an x-ray.</p>
<p>“This is simply not good enough. After nine years the Government should admit that the hole in Health funding is hurting our front line medical care.</p>
<p>“This week Waikato Hospital admitted that it had a crisis when 40 patients in its emergency department needed to be admitted and there were no free beds.</p>
<p>In Auckland the Counties Manukau DHB says the number of days when Middlemore Hospital has a ‘full day’ has risen from 7 to 17 in the past four years. At Auckland Hospital the number of days when beds are at 100 per cent occupancy has risen from four in 2013/14 to 16 already this year.</p>
<p>“The Minister knows that in the Budget he has to stump up with an additional $1 billion for the district health boards to fund the Aged Care settlement and maintain existing services. That is without repaying a single cent of the $1.7 billion stripped from the health system over the last six years.</p>
<p>“Waiting times and full beds across our hospitals are symptomatic of a growing crisis. After nine years, it’s time for a fresh approach on health,” says David Clark.</p>
