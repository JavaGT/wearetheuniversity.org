<p>Tongan youth suicide prevention</p>
<p>New Zealand’s first evidence-based resource for Pacific suicide prevention.</p>
<p><em>Tongan Youth Suicide Prevention in Aotearoa</em> was developed in collaboration between researchers at Auckland University of Technology (AUT) and the University of Auckland, with funding from the Health Research Council of New Zealand.</p>
<p>The information resource provides an ethnic-specific approach to understanding and addressing suicide prevention for Tongan youth in New Zealand.</p>
<p>AUT PhD student, Aulola Fuka-Lino, led the resource development project.</p>
<p>The content draws from the work of Dr Jemaima Tiatia-Seath, a senior lecturer in Pacific Studies at Auckland University and author of <em>Suicide Prevention for Tongan Youth in New Zealand.</em></p>
<p>Key risk factors for suicide include ‘the pressures’ associated with familial obligation, financial strain, living up to high expectations, achieving elitist sporting status and walking between two worlds.</p>
<p>Tongan youth in New Zealand have to navigate their way between two or more ethnic identities.</p>
<p>This tension contributes to feelings of alienation and disconnect. It also fosters resentment and anger towards parents who don’t understand the difficulty of balancing western expectations with Tongan traditions.</p>
<p>Dr Tiatia-Seath says Tongan youth suicide prevention must be inclusive of the family.</p>
<p>“Open and consistent communication within the family is key. Young people need to talk about issues and families need to be equipped with safe messaging around suicide. Maintaining regular check-ups among family members saves lives,” she says.</p>

<p>The information resource outlines the <em>Heilala Malu</em> Tongan Framework for Suicide Prevention – an approach that is meaningful and effective for Tongans, encompassing <em>ofa</em> (love, compassion, care and kindness), <em>toka’i</em> (respect), <em>loto lelei</em> (humility and open-mindedness) and <em>fetauhi’aki</em> (respectful relationships).</p>
<p>This framework is symbolised by Tonga’s national flower, traditionally reserved for the King and those of chiefly rank. The <em>heilala</em> reflects the beauty and elegance of the framework, and the value of life itself.</p>
<p><em>Tongan Youth Suicide Prevention in Aotearoa</em> will be launched at AUT South Campus last night.</p>
<p>The four-page leaflet will be distributed by Le Va, community groups and stakeholders.</p>
<p>It is available in both Tongan and English language.</p>
<p>The Vakatele Pacific Research Network at AUT South Campus is pleased to see a practical outcome from its research students.</p>
<p>Fuka-Lino, who is undertaking a Doctor of Philosophy at AUT, says more ethnic-specific resources are required for community health promotion and practice.</p>
<p>“We wanted to create something relevant to the Tongan community that would raise awareness of a sensitive issue. And, this is a good starting point. If it benefits a family or individual, then we have done our job,” she says.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, there are approximately 500 suicide deaths each year. Pacific peoples, particularly those aged 12-18 years, are three times more likely to attempt suicide.</p>
