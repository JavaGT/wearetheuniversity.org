<p>A book that offers new perspectives on urban sustainability and resilience has been launched at the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>The publication <em>Unravelling Sustainability and Resilience in the Built Environment</em> was co-authored by Dr Emilio Garcia from the School of Architecture and Planning in Auckland, and Professorial Research Fellow Brenda Vale from Victoria University in Wellington.</p>
<p>The book explores what sustainability and resilience means when applied to the built environment, how they are related to each other and why they are essential concepts for designers.   </p>
<p>Using case studies, the authors argue that sustainability in the built environment would benefit from a better understanding of resilience.</p>
<p>Dr Garcia, who is originally from Argentina, teaches sustainability at the University, including courses on architectural design, and urban resilience.</p>
<p>“With the world increasingly facing environmental issues, we must have a broad understanding of what resilience means,” says Dr Garcia.</p>
<p>Published by Routledge, the book is intended as a reference for both students and professionals.  </p>
