<p><strong>UC Connect public lecture – To fall or not to fall: The Science of Rock-climbing</strong></p>
<p>By their very nature, adventure sports involve managing risk, and rock climbing is no exception. From leaving the ground, a climber has to manage the risk involved in making an ascent.</p>
<p>The risks or stresses associated with rock climbing are multifaceted, including aspects such as the height and a potential fall, equipment and safety, the environment and the nature of the climb.</p>
<p>Since he was a teenager making his first climbing ascent on the Dorset coast, University of Canterbury Professor Nick Draper has been fascinated by the psychological and physiological stresses associated with climbing. He’s interested is exploring the ability of experienced climbers to ‘lock-down’ the anxiety associated with ascending a route many metres above the ground.</p>
<p>This upcoming UC Connect public lecture will focus primarily on the psychophysiological stresses associated with climbing, a sport which in Tokyo in 2020 will become an Olympic event.</p>
<p>Professor of Sport and Exercise Science in the College of Education, Health &amp; Human Development, Nick Draper has an extensive background in sport coaching and physical education, specialising in sport and exercise science and exercise physiology. His research primarily takes an applied focus, most recently working on multi-centre and multi-disciplinary research projects.</p>
<p>Prof Draper is Chair of the International Rock Climbing Research Association (IRCRA). He is currently leading an international multi-centre trial of sport-specific measurement and evaluation for the sport of rock climbing (<a href="http://www.ircra.rocks">www.ircra.rocks</a>).</p>
<p>UC Connect public lecture: <strong>To fall or not to fall: The Science of Rock-climbing</strong>, Professor Nick Draper, 7pm on Wednesday 24 May at the University of Canterbury.</p>
