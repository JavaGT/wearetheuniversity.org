<p><strong>Speech at Public Meeting on Christ Church Cathedral</strong><br>Cathedral Square,<br>Christchurch<br>1.30pm, Sunday, 28th May, 2017</p>
<p><strong>Christ Church Cathedral – let’s get moving</strong>  </p>
<p>There has been so much said. So much written.<br>But this building, Christ Church Cathedral, sits in the heart of this wonderful city.<br>The city on the edge of the Canterbury Plains.<br>The city that’s known for its Gothic-style Cathedral, right in the centre.<br>Yes, right here is a church.<br>But it is so much more.<br>Many here in Christchurch will say it is “our cathedral”.<br>You are right. It is the image of your city, of your place, the place you identify with.<br>There were so many events held here that were non-religious – like the annual flower carpet - and it’s always been an attraction.<br>That’s why the City Council supported it financially.<br>It’s been a church, an event centre, a tourist attraction – the city’s jewel.</p>
<p><strong>Heritage</strong><br>There are others who say it is old, now ruined, so demolish it and move on, it’s a giant waste of money.<br>Move on where? And with what? And forgetting how much?<br>It is, rightly, a Category 1 listed heritage building.<br>It tells a story of the city’s past.<br>Yes, its history is with religion.<br>But in this city it’s impossible to ignore that link.<br>The city shares its name. It’s called Christchurch after all.<br>And is home to the Crusaders.<br>The cathedral’s heritage value is so much higher now – with so many other heritage buildings lost.<br>Like the historic “Press” building, a notable edifice that stood on the corner behind the cathedral.<br>The cathedral’s heritage listing makes demolition a no-go.<br>That would be like opening up a new front on the battleground.<br>You don’t need that.</p>

<p><strong>So Many Views</strong><br>There are so many views on “what to do”.<br>We are not here to canvass those today.<br>We are here today to say the government should have taken decisive action.<br>I said that three years ago and I am saying it today.</p>
<p><strong>Join Together</strong><br>The question that must be addressed is:<br>Why haven’t all those arguments, and opinions come together?<br>Some of you will remember the anthem-like, hit song of your 1974 Commonwealth Games – <em>Join Together.</em><br>And back then you did. The city and its people came together, put on an event that was a resounding success.<br>And New Zealand took the first gold medal - thanks to Timaru-born Dick Tayler, who shot home in front of 35,000 people to win the 10,000 metres.<br>That run set the “friendly” Games alight.<br>The Games were a triumph. So good, Christchurch decided to do it all again the following year, and staged the one and only New Zealand Games.<br>As you know, the main venue for the ‘74 Games, QE2, was also dealt a fatal blow in February 2011.<br>It’s not lying there as a pile of rubble now. It’s gone.<br>But your cathedral is lying in its unglamorous, unattended, neglected state right here.<br>It’s open to the weather.<br>A ruin is not the acceptable face of a city being re-born.<br>Sure, some ruins historically have been left as reminders of the past around the world.<br>But not for the reasons yours has been left neglected.<br>Those societies couldn’t fix them, your society can.<br>And that’s the New Zealand way.<br>And that’s what should happen to Christchurch’s most familiar famous sight.</p>
<p><strong>Ownership</strong><br>It has been six years.<br>We know the cathedral is legally owned by the Anglican Church.<br>So, some heat must go there for its inability to resolve its own problem.<br>As a building owner it must take responsibility.<br>Leaving the cathedral derelict is not acceptable behaviour of a good citizen.<br>Particularly one that owns “the heart” of the city.<br>Any other homeowner would be chastised and derided if they neglected their property.<br>The last thing quake-stressed Christchurch needed was to be drawn into an argument over “what to do” about the cathedral.<br>But that happened.<br>There has been no “harmonious spirit” – as there was around the ‘74 Games.<br>There has been no-one calling for everyone to join together “in the spirit” the 1974 song called for.<br>There’s been no government leadership, that’s the difference**.**  </p>
<p><strong>The Minister</strong><br>The Minister responsible for the Rebuild and Recovery has been given extraordinary powers.<br>Kremlin-like powers.<br>So leadership and “ownership” of the issue was expected.<br>Six years of bickering attests to the emptiness of the leadership chair.<br>Others stepped up, but not the one who should have - the Minister.<br>Certainly, after the quakes there were mighty decisions to be made.<br>But the cathedral’s future was one of them.<br>No doubt the Minister blames the Church.<br>Gerry has moved on, for the new minister, Christchurch Central MP Nicky Wagner.<br>We want her to show leadership. And now.<br>Tell the Church to accept a programme to restore the Cathedral, and keep its gothic style and heritage as far as is practical.</p>
<p><strong>The report</strong><br>Mr Brownlee sat on the Cathedral Working Group report which has called for “reinstatement” of the cathedral.<br>It was supposed to have been released this week, but no sign of it, but when we announced on twitter and facebook a public meeting to be held here today, lordy, lordy it was suddenly released.<br>There’s no need to further mull over this report.<br>There’s no need to wait for the Church’s Synod in September to deliberate, which is what the Bishop wants.<br>The Minister must now adopt the report, command the Bishop and the Church Property Trustees, as she can, to do the same, and move ahead.<br>It’s time for your city’s Cathedral Project of restoration and re-birth to begin.<br>It won’t happen overnight.<br>But the city will be buoyed when the first signs and sounds of work begin.<br>A trust can be formed, through legislation, to take over the project.<br>The Church’s insurance pay out of $42 million will go into building the sum of $100 million required.<br>The government has already offered to contribute around 10 per cent of the funding.<br>That is not nearly enough.<br>The report recommends fundraising will have to fill the 50 per cent void.<br>However, let’s think about what Christchurch has earned for the government.<br>There’s some economic debate, but the tax take from the Christchurch Rebuild sits between $7 billion and $11 billion.<br>A bonanza from your catastrophe.<br>Don’t you think you should get some of it back?<br>And here’s one project that just needs a tiny ounce of that quake gold.<br>That contribution would rule out asking Christchurch and the rest of New Zealand to fill the donation buckets.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>The waiting is over.<br>The report has been written, enough views and opinions have been canvassed. There’s been enough talk.<br>The government has the ball in its hands – it has been sitting there for a long time.<br>It’s time to play ball.<br>And you have my personal undertaking that if the government doesn’t start now we will start this project after the next election.  </p>
