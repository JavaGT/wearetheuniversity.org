<p>Government still MIA on mental health</p>
<p>Mental health services have been in such a dire state for such a long time that only a full inquiry and a significant injection of Government money will make a difference, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>The Health Minister today announced that mental health services will get a cross-Government approach, mainly funded within existing baseline funding.</p>
<p>“Families of people experiencing mental health problems are being short-changed by a Government that has been missing in action for far too long,” Green Party health spokesperson Julie Anne Genter said.</p>
<p>“It’s great that the Minister is finally realising what thousands of New Zealanders have been telling him, our mental health system isn’t working and needs help.</p>
<p>“A full nationwide mental health inquiry is needed to identify the systemic problems, and deliver effective solutions, rather than just tinkering around the edges.</p>
<p>“Our health system has been underfunded to the tune of $1.7billion since National have been in power, so there just isn’t spare money waiting around to be repurposed for mental health.</p>
<p>“This Government’s Social Investment Approach will only target those who fit a very narrow fixed definition of needing help.</p>
<p>“The reality is that many teenagers needing mental health help or new mothers with postnatal depression will not have a parent in prison or on a benefit so they will not get seen any faster or get the help they need,” said Ms Genter.</p>
