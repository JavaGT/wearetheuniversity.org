<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>1 May 2017</p>
<p><strong>Time to recognise school support staff</strong></p>
<p>School support staff do an amazing job with some of our most vulnerable children and they deserve better recognition, says Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins.</p>
<p>“This morning I worked alongside support staff at Upper Hutt Primary School. I got to see first-hand what a fantastic job they do and was reminded of the challenges that they face.</p>
<p>“It’s time we recognised their roles properly and funded them accordingly.</p>
<p>“At the moment, school support staff are paid out of the school operations grant. That means they are competing with day-to-day costs like electricity, ICT, classroom resources and school maintenance. That’s just not right.</p>
<p>“The Labour Party has made a clear commitment to fund school support staff through a centralised system, as we presently do for teachers. Through such a system we can make sure they get the recognition they deserve.</p>
<p>“We will also ensure that support staff are given better training and professional development opportunities, and have access to a career framework that rewards them for advancing their skills.</p>
<p>“School support staff are national treasures. Let’s thank them for their exceptional work by giving them the pay and conditions they deserve,” says Chris Hipkins.  </p>
