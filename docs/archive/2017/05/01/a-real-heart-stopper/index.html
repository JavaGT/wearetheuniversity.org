<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>1 May 2017</p>
<p>A real heart stopper?</p>
<p>The story of a Hamilton man who jumpstarted his heart with an electric fencing unit may be a classic bit of ‘number 8’ wire thinking but it also reveals a lot about our stressed health system, says Labour’s Health spokesperson David Clark.</p>
<p>“It is alarming to read Kiwi John Griffin had to use his neighbour’s 8000 volt electric fence to jumpstart his heart after having to wait hours at Waikato Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>“While it’s easy to applaud John’s DIY attitude it shows that our hospitals are no longer coping. His irregular heartbeat was a serious health risk and could have led to a stroke.</p>
<p>“He was forced to wait two hours for care and then was told he would have to hang around for a further six hours. While I sympathize with overworked hospital staff the delay in this case is just unacceptable.</p>
<p>“The Waikato District Health Board has said in its latest board minutes that a surplus just isn’t deliverable because costs have grown at a faster rate than government funding. They earlier forecasted a surplus but it has been wiped out.</p>
<p>“Across the country our DHBs are forecasting a year-end deficit of $85.9 million.</p>
<p>“The Government has to restore the $1.7 billion of health funding lost over the last eight years and make sure patients like John are safe,” says David Clark.</p>
