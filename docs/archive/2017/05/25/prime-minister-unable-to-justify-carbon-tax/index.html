<p>Prime Minister Unable to Justify Carbon Tax</p>
<p>Prime Minister Bill English is unable to justify the huge $1.4 billion annual cost to New Zealand families, farmers and businesses, of a useless Emissions Trading Scheme, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“This scheme has made no progress internationally and cannot be credibly measured,” says Spokesperson for Climate Change Denis O’Rourke.</p>
<p>“That amount of money represents thousands of houses that could be built. This is a government that claims the media has manufactured homelessness.</p>
<p>“This National government is so out of touch that they see nothing wrong with paying foreigners billions of dollars to buy carbon credits. It’s a useless exercise, it will do nothing to cut our emissions, and it will continue to cost us more.</p>
<p>“National has already spent $2.3 billion overseas for these useless credits since 2008.</p>
<p>“Mr English denied these facts even though they were revealed in a table sent in March this year by Minister in charge of Climate Change Paula Bennett in reply to questions from NZ First (table attached). It shows $1,411,852 million total net climate change related expenses for the 2015/16 year; and the total of each year recorded since 2008 is indisputably $2.3 Billion.</p>
<p>“A Prime Minister who is so out-of-touch has no hope of successfully leading New Zealand to the carbon-neutral future we signed up to in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.</p>
<p>“Mr English claims he has ‘multi-party support’ for his worthless ETS policy. Untrue.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First has clearly stated it would abolish the ETS so that the $1.4 billion could be invested in a range of other actions, including research and development, insulating homes, planting forests, and implementing electrification in transport.”</p>
