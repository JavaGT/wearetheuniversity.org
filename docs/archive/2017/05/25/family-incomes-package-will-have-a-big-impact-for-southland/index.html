<p>Media statement</p>

<p>Family Incomes Package will have a big impact for Southland families</p>
<p>MP for Invercargill, Sarah Dowie is pleased with the National Government’s work to date in helping families get ahead and says Budget 2017 has continued this commitment.</p>
<p>“The centrepiece of Budget 2017 is a $2 billion Family Incomes Package that will ensure families directly share in the benefits of our strong and growing economy,” Ms Dowie said.</p>
<p>“The package is carefully designed to help low and middle income earners with young families and higher housing costs. These changes are expected to raise 50,000 children out of hardship.</p>
<p>The package will raise the incomes of 1.3 million families by an average of $26 a week. It is also expected to lift 20,000 families above the threshold for severe housing stress and reduce the number of children living in families receiving less than half the median income by about 50,000.</p>
<p>The package has three key elements – adjusting income tax thresholds, increasing Working for Families and providing additional support for people on low incomes with high accommodation costs.</p>
<p>“The changes mean, for example, a couple with two children under 13 and one partner earning $55,000 will gain $41 a week plus any increase to their accommodation supplement. With living costs in Southland lower than the rest of New Zealand these changes will have a real impact for local families,” Ms Dowie said.</p>

<p>Around 750,000 superannuitants and 41,000 students will also benefit from the package. The couple rate for superannuitants will increase by $13 a week on 1 April next year in addition to the normal adjustments.</p>
<p>“Budget 2017 is about delivering for New Zealanders – this is the whole point of having a strong and growing economy. This Family Incomes Package is the first step in allowing Kiwi families to spend more of their own money, so they can make the decisions that are best for them,” Ms Dowie said.</p>
