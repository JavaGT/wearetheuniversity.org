<p>Tax relief overdue and underdone</p>
<p>“An adjustment of tax brackets is a welcome compensation for the last seven years of bracket creep. ACT has been talking about this for years. But the adjustment is underdone,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“The most any taxpayer will save is $20 a week. And it’s ultimately more of a tax reset than a genuine tax cut. Bracket creep will eventually cancel out this tax relief because National refuses to permanently tie brackets to inflation.</p>
<p>“And the Government has bafflingly failed to adjust the top tax bracket, meaning once someone earns $70,000, they start paying 33% of every pay rise in tax.</p>
<p>$70,000 used to be a big salary, but now it’s not – especially if you’re paying off a student loan or mortgage.</p>
<p>“By failing to adjust the top bracket, the tax burden has shifted even further onto the 17% of Kiwis earning over $70,000 – who already pay 45% of all income tax.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, <a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=15583&qid=4041678">ACT’s plan</a> would cut tax rates for every bracket, and ensure no-one pays more than a 25% tax rate. This would help New Zealanders invest in local businesses, their families, and themselves.”<br>ENDS</p>
