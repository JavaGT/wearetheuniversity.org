<p>Rent-to-buy a solution to unaffordable housing  </p>
<p>A Government backed rent-to-buy programme would open the door to home ownership for the four in five New Zealanders who can’t afford a house according to the Government’s new Housing Affordability Measure, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>“With a rent-to-buy programme we could get thousands of families into their own homes, affordably,” Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said.</p>
<p>“The Green Party’s <a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/home-for-life">Home for Life plan</a> would save people $100 a week on mortgage payments. Payments would be no more than 30 percent of a household’s income.</p>
<p>“Rent-to-buy and progressive ownership programmes are in place around the world and there are some small scale examples working well in Queenstown, Rototua, and other parts of New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Rent-to-buy is proven to work and it’s the kind of solution that any responsible government would be taking a close look at.</p>
<p>“The new Housing Affordability Measure tells us what everyone’s known for ages: we have a housing crisis, it’s getting worse under National, and it’s worst in Auckland.</p>
<p>“National doesn’t have any new ideas to turn the housing crisis around, but the Green Party does,” Mrs Turei said.  </p>
