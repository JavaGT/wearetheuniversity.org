<p><strong>Thursday, 11 May 2017, 3:11 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters</p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>11 MAY 2017  </p>
<p>Hosking Singing Out of Tune – as Usual</p>
<p>As Mike Hosking says he is “not a journalist”.</p>
<p>And by <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11853337">his last column</a> he is certainly no analyst.</p>
<p>He may be free to have his vituperative attack on Andrew Little but he is not going to get away with it where I am concerned.</p>
<p>His trenchant dismissal of New Zealand First is why no self-respecting media should employ him, but that is another story.</p>
<p>He says “half of the 70,000 (it’s net 71,900) involve New Zealanders and Australians”.</p>
<p>He’s referring to net immigration and his statement is false.</p>
<p>He says “No-one wants to leave and lots want to come back” – that statement is false.</p>
<p>In the last measurable year, the difference of those leaving New Zealand and those coming back was a net loss to New Zealand of 1,300.</p>
<p>Then he says “to cut the overall numbers by tens of thousands, what’s Andrew is telling them - they can’t come back or in?” Apart from the grammatical porridge that statement is also false.</p>
<p>Mr Hosking doesn’t understand that New Zealanders returning home are not immigrants; a kindergarten child would know that.</p>
<p>And there you have it really.</p>
<p>But of course, as the British say, ‘The malady of the ignorant is to be ignorant without knowing it.’</p>
