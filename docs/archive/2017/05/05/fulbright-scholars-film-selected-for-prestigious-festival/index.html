<p><strong>Waikato Fulbright scholar’s film selected for prestigious festival</strong></p>
<p>Young American film-maker Nick Homler, a visiting Fulbright scholar with Waikato’s Screen &amp; Media programme in 2015, has had his first full-length documentary selected for the 2017 Doc Edge International Documentary Film Festival.</p>
<p>Nick’s documentary <em>The Reel People of New Zealand</em> was co-produced with Waikato’s Screen &amp; Media lecturer Associate Professor Geoff Lealand and inspired by Professor Lealand’s <em>Cinemas of New Zealand</em> website. It was selected for the prestigious festival by competition and takes audiences on a journey through New Zealand, visiting small and independent cinemas along the way.</p>
<p>Audiences will encounter projection booths from years gone by, cinemas returning to Christchurch post-earthquake, local communities bringing back film to their town, a wedding in a Waikato cinema, and a very unique viewing experience on Stewart Island. The film is about the past, present and possible future of film-going in Aotearoa.</p>
<p>Professor Lealand is proud of Nick’s achievement. “As the co-producer I provided contacts, facilities, ideas and a little inspiration along the way. But this is Nick’s film and I consider it an extraordinary achievement to have it selected for Doc Edge. During his time with the Screen &amp; Media programme, Nick was an inspiration to our students and staff due to the days, nights and weekends he spent putting his film together,” says Professor Lealand.</p>

<p>The Doc Edge festival, now in its 12th year, will take place in Wellington from May 10 – 21 and Auckland from May 24 – June 5. It features some of the best documentaries from around the world including Europe, America, Asia, the Middle East and Australasia.</p>
<p>Since his Fulbright experience, Nick’s career in the film industry is off to a great start having worked on the PBS show <em>Finding Your Roots</em>, with the New York Rangers hockey team, and for media companies across the New York area.</p>
<p>When asked about his Fulbright film Nick replied, “I have kept in touch with many of the interviewees and I can honestly say that I have never experienced such generosity during my travels. This film is about them, the people who have devoted their lives to sharing the joy of cinema with their community. I hope that my audience takes notice of the everyday efforts that go into keeping their local cinema in business.”</p>
<p>Nick would also like to thank Professor Lealand, Fulbright New Zealand, the Screen &amp; Media Studies staff, Marist College and the University of Waikato for all of their resources and assistance in making this film possible.</p>
<p><em>The Reel People of New Zealand</em> will screen on May 12 at 4.30pm in Wellington’s The Roxy and on June 2 at 2.30pm in Auckland’s Q Theatre.
