<p><strong>Forced migrations and borders the focus of University of Otago Foreign Policy conference</strong></p>
<p>Forced migrations of hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, the closing and enforcement of immigration borders, and the widespread misery and geopolitical instability that ensues is the focus of this year’s Otago Foreign Policy School. This annual gathering is the premier fixture in the New Zealand international relations calendar.</p>
<p>The 52nd School will see international and national experts converge in Dunedin to tackle the pressing issues around national and international boundaries and borders – including political, economic, legal and ethical aspects – that forced migration creates through factors such as disasters, climate change and armed conflict.</p>
<p>The venue is St Margaret’s College in Dunedin and the School, titled “Open and Closed Borders: The Geopolitics of Migration”, opens on Friday 30 June at 5:40 pm and continues until Sunday afternoon. Around 150 attendees are expected to take part in the gathering.</p>
<p>This year’s School is being co-directed by Associate Professor Jacqui Leckie of the Department of Anthropology and Archaeology, Dr Heather Devere of the National Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies and Dr Simon Ryan of the Department of Languages and Cultures.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Leckie says that the impressive invited speaker line-up features international experts on a range of topics including globalisation, immigration borders including the US-Mexico border, Pacific climate change migrants, global migration, refugee policies, asylum seekers, Pacific detention centres, and racism and Muslim identity.</p>

<p>“The humanitarian tragedy resulting from the Syrian conflict has thrown these issues into stark relief, but that particular horror is only one of dozens being played out around the world,” she says.</p>
<p>“No territory, including Aotearoa/New Zealand, remains unaffected by the web of consequences that links forced migration events, which include people smuggling and human trafficking.</p>
<p>“For example, there has been an ongoing increase in New Zealand’s refugee quota, which recently saw Invercargill announced as new resettlement centre. This has caused some disquiet among civic leaders due to a perceived lack of consultation about the centre’s establishment.”</p>
<p>Concerted efforts by a broad range of governmental and non-governmental agencies are required to effectively respond to the profound challenges that forced migrations present, Associate Professor Leckie states.</p>
<p>“We expect that the School will involve much fruitful debate about the most workable solutions to what, on the face of it, can seem like intractable problems.”</p>
<p>A special feature of the School will be a roundtable late on the afternoon of 1 July discussing the question: “Should the refugee quota in Aotearoa/New Zealand be raised?”</p>
