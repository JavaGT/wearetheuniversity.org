<p>Immigration and the future in super-diverse Auckland</p>
<p>What does it mean to live in a rapidly growing, super-diverse city where 40 per cent of residents were born overseas while others are more at home with the time when diversity was negligible?</p>
<p>Weighing up the value of ethnic diversity alongside the volume of immigration to Auckland’s character and its future prosperity is a vexed and complex issue – one that is top of mind for many who dwell in the country’s sprawling metropolis, according to a new report by Massey University sociologists.</p>
<p>A public forum, hosted by an ethnically diverse panel with a breadth of experience in this area, aims to broaden and shed light on the debate about immigration numbers, as well as how both recent arrivals and born-and-bred residents cultivate a sense of belonging.</p>
<p>The June 6 public discussion,Talking ethnic diversity and immigration in Tamaki Makaurau, is being hosted by the Auckland Knowledge Exchange Hub and RIMU (Auckland Council’s Research and Evaluation Unit) – a joint venture between Massey University and Auckland Council.</p>
<p>The event was planned after researchers from Massey’s School of People, Environment and Planning, Associate Professor Ann Dupuis and Dr Trudie Cain, canvassed recent media coverage and readers’ responses to articles published in 2016 about ‘ethnic diversity’ and ‘immigration’ and wrote a report. The panel will speak on three themes that emerged from their work, followed by a Q&amp;A session.</p>
<p>They will tackle gnarly questions such as: Can Brexit/Trump happen here? When is enough enough? And what does it mean to belong to this place?</p>
