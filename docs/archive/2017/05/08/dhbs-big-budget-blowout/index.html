<p>New Zealand’s District Health Boards are now facing a budget deficit of nearly $90 million dollars, a significant blowout on what was forecast, says Labour’s Health spokesperson David Clark.</p>
<p>“Labour believes health funding must grow to avoid further cuts to the sector. Instead, this visionless Government seems content to allow death by a 1000 ‘service reductions’ with stretched DHB funding putting further stress on an already stretched health workforce.</p>
<p>“Add into this the fact DHBs will be responsible for $11 million of funding under the new Pharmac spending programme, and it’s clear that these financial strains are only going to get worse.</p>
<p>“The Government’s own predicted budget deficit for the DHBs this financial year was $59 million. Eleven DHBs are now in a deficit hole.</p>
<p>“Canterbury and Capital and Coast are among the worst but the smaller DHBs like Northland and Wairarapa are also struggling.</p>
<p>“Northland says its having to spend more money with the growth in cancer treatment and the Wairarapa is facing significant cost increases due to mental health.</p>
<p>“The latest Treasury report on DHBs’ financial performance believes that some DHBs are underfunding repairs and maintenance to help balance their books.</p>
<p>“The Government is facing the consequences of a $1.7 billion financial hole that has developed over the last six years. Minister you have to act,” says David Clark.</p>
