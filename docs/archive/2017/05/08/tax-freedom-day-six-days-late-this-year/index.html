<p>Tax Freedom Day six days late this year: Workin’ Harder for the (tax)Man</p>
<p>ACT Leader David Seymour says the late Tax Freedom Day, <a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=15486&qid=4004338">marked today</a> by accounting firm Staples Rodway, shows how the taxpayer is persecuted under this Government.</p>
<p>“I thought getting rid of the socialists in 2008 meant happy days for taxpayers, but today’s setback leaves us in a crappy haze,” says Mr Seymour.</p>
<p>“Tax Freedom day last year was on May 1, now it is May 8th. In just one year, New Zealanders have lost an extra week to the Government. And to think some people argue about losing an hour to daylight savings!</p>
<p>“New Zealanders spent the last four months and eight days working for taxman – more than a third of their working year. Apparently we spend a third of our life in bed, then another third working for the IRD, it doesn’t leave much!</p>
<p>“In contrast, Australia’s Tax Freedom Day fell on April 13, and the USA’s on April 23. New Zealand needs to do better because talent and investment are mobile. Overtaxing can actually make us poorer.</p>
<p>“With the Government books producing fat surpluses, there’s no need for it to tax us so hard. On Thursday, ACT will announce a policy of substantial tax cuts, which will ensure less of your year is spent working for the Government.</p>
<p>“ACT also supports Staples Rodway’s suggestion to adjust tax brackets for inflation on a continuing basis. Not only is that policy more honest, it will save New Zealanders thousands in stealth tax increases.”</p>
