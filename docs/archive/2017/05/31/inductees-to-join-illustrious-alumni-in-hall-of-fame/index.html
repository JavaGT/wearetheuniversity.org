<p>Inductees to join illustrious alumni in Hall of Fame</p>
<p>Four more illustrious alumni will be inducted into the College of Creative Arts Hall of Fame at Massey University later this week.</p>
<p>Musician Warren Maxwell, multi-media artist Judy Darragh, cartoonist Sharon Murdoch and designer Grenville Main join a celebrated roll call of artists, designers and musicians who have been made members of the Hall of Fame since its inception a decade ago.</p>
<p>Luminaries such as special effects designer Sir Richard Taylor, fashion designer Rebecca Taylor, product designers Danny Coster (Apple and now Go Pro), photojournalist Robin Hammond, digital artist Gus Hunter and posthumously, artists Len Lye, Gordon Walters and John Drawbridge have all been similarly honoured since 2007.</p>
<p>The latest recipients will receive their awards at a gala dinner taking place at Te Papa on Friday.</p>
<p>College of Creative Pro Vice-Chancellor, Professor Claire Robinson, says it is always a rewarding event to honour graduates from the College, (that started more than 130 years ago as the School of Design), who have made a creative contribution to New Zealand’s cultural and economic progress.</p>
<p>“We are immensely proud to welcome these outstanding alumni, all of whom have contributed to New Zealand’s economy, reputation and identity through art, music or design, as well as taking innovative ideas to the global economy and popular culture.”</p>
