<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>31 May, 2017</p>
<p>Māori Party Co-leaders Marama Fox and Te Ururoa Flavell</p>
<p><strong>Māori Party calls for Royal Commission of Inquiry into child abuse</strong></p>
<p>Bringing justice for tamariki abuse victims in institutional care is why the Māori Party Co-leader Marama Fox stood in the House today to call on Minister for Children Anne Tolley for a Royal Commission of Inquiry.</p>
<p>“This has got to be dealt with, it is a systemic issue and we as Māori must rise up and say not one more, never again,” says Ms Fox</p>
<p>“The only way to bring this about is by calling for a Royal Commission of Inquiry into tamariki placed in institutional care between the 1950s and 1990s,” she says.</p>
<p>“A Royal Commission of Inquiry is independent from the Government and reports to the Governor General. The Government cannot interfere in the direction taken by an inquiry or influence the findings. A Royal Commission can inquire into any matters it sees fit in order to determine the cause of the issues,” Ms Fox says.</p>
<p>“By not allowing an inquiry like this robs the victims of the chance to see justice served. Bring it out into the light.”</p>
<p>Māori Party Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell says there is a need to acknowledge that horrific and widespread sexual and physical abuse occurred.</p>
<p>“No child deserves to suffer the way these tamariki did, least of all from the institution which hadbeen entrusted with their care.</p>
<p>“There is a need to acknowledge that horrific and widespread sexual and physical abuse occurred,” says Mr Flavell.</p>

<p>“We will probably never know how widespread this abuse was and I suspect there are still some out there who are too traumatised to publicly acknowledge it.</p>
<p>“It’s this lack of information that makes it imperative that we have this inquiry into the abuse of tamariki in institutional care,” Mr Flavell says.</p>
<p>Ms Fox says; “We have heard the harrowing stories of tamariki taken into institutional care completely vulnerable to the violent inhumane treatment by adults they were placed with.</p>
<p>“These people suffered institutional abuse and racism by successive governments that abandoned hundreds of thousands of our tamariki,” she says.</p>
<p>“We have heard our people who have said this is our stolen generation and the Crown have breached all principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi by severing Māori from their whānau, hapū and iwi, connections to whakapapa, reo, tikanga and turangawaewae,” Ms Fox says.</p>
<p>“This is why we are calling on Minister Tolley to take action today,” says Ms Fox.</p>
<p>“I believe having an independent inquiry will help begin the healing and reconciliation process much needed for these victims and Aotearoa as a whole.”</p>
<p>The Māori Party acknowledges The Mana Party which is also calling for a Royal Commission of Inquiry.</p>
