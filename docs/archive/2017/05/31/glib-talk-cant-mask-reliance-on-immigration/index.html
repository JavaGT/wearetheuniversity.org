<p>Glib Talk Can’t Mask Reliance on Immigration</p>
<p>New Zealand First questions the National government’s claims over the economy.</p>
<p>“The reliance on mass immigration is propping up GDP, which in reality is less than 1 per cent,” says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Finance Minister Steven Joyce suggested in Parliament today that this assumption is wonky, and glibly claims the OECD and others support his exaggerated claims on economic driving factors.</p>
<p>“Clearly he hasn’t read the OECD forecast summary issued at the end of last year.</p>
<p>“It says ‘both net migration and expenditure on the Canterbury earthquake rebuild are expected to slow gradually, slowing domestic demand, especially construction activity.</p>
<p>“The report also points to the ‘challenges posed by inequalities and exclusion’ and says the government should fund infrastructure and increased funding to address these problems.</p>
<p>“Why hasn’t the National government, over nine years, tackled those problems, and allowed them to become so extreme the OECD has been forced to comment.</p>
<p>“This is hardly an economy which Mr Joyce describes as ‘going a little too quickly’.</p>
<p>“Under National we have had: low real GDP growth; low real GDP per capita; stagnant wages; productivity down; manufacturing down; and output GDP forecasts down for almost 10 years.”</p>
