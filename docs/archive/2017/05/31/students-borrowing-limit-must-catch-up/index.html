<p>Students’ borrowing limit must catch up</p>
<p>A short term measure to take pressure off desperate students would be to simply increase their weekly borrowing limit, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=15617&qid=4064822">Last night I spoke to Victoria University students</a>, and student welfare was a major focus.</p>
<p>“Beyond the long term solution of reforming our land use and building terms, we need a short term measure for students who are desperate now.</p>
<p>“The borrowing limit for student living costs needs to catch up with the reality of the market students face. Since 2006, rents have increased by about 45%. In other words, a $140 room now costs over $200. The weekly borrowing cap for living costs, however, has only increased by 19%, from $150 to $178.81, meaning many students can’t even use it to cover rent.</p>
<p>“We should have increased the borrowing cap in line with rental costs. If we’d done this since 2006, the cap would be about $40 dollars higher than the current level.</p>
<p>“A stronger ACT will force National to make this belated adjustment, and we’d then index the borrowing cap to ongoing rental inflation.</p>
<p>“This would be a huge relief for students’ suffering from rent-induced hardship. And because it has to be paid back, it isn’t a huge burden on the taxpayer, and students still have an incentive to borrow wisely.”</p>
