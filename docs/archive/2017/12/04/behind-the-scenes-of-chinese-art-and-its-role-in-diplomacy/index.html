<p><strong>Behind the scenes of Chinese art and its role in soft diplomacy</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>New China Eyewitness: Roger Duff, Rewi Alley and the art of museum diplomacy</em></strong></p>
<p>Colourful eyewitness accounts in a new book from Canterbury University Press bring to life the fascinating story of how Canterbury Museum came to acquire the largest collection of Chinese art in New Zealand after a group of prominent New Zealanders visited the People’s Republic of China in 1956.</p>
<p><em>New China Eyewitness</em> provides important new perspectives on the Chinese Communist Party policy of using traditional artworks in soft diplomacy and the vital role art collecting played in giving the People&#39;s Republic of China a voice in non-communist countries.</p>
<p>The book contains portions of Canterbury Museum director Roger Duff’s diary during the trip. These first-hand accounts contain rare insights, including the ‘Hundred Flowers’ campaign which encouraged intellectuals to engage in constructive criticism as a means of strengthening socialism.</p>
<p>“Roger Duff’s detailed and highly readable diary, enhanced by extracts from others on the delegation, provides a remarkable eyewitness account of a rapidly developing China, at a unique time and unprecedented moment in its history,” says co-editor Dr Richard Bullen, Head of the Art History and Theory Department at UC.</p>
<p>The rise of China has heightened public interest in all aspects of the nation, especially in its traditional artworks, as illustrated by the popularity of exhibitions of Chinese artworks.</p>

<p>“The beautifully captured, yet ‘gritty’ street photographs of everyday life provide fascinating detail about the domestic, political and cultural situation of China in the 1950s,” adds co-editor Associate Professor James Beattie from Victoria University of Wellington.</p>
<p><em>New China Eyewitness</em> details how the People&#39;s Republic of China reached out to the West through exhibitions and exchanges of traditional artworks during the Cold War. It also provides a detailed lesson on the primacy of art in the foreign policy of the People&#39;s Republic of China government, and through one of its main foreign supporters, New Zealander Rewi Alley, its use as a tool of soft diplomacy. This included, quite remarkably, the lifting of its own export ban on antiquities, to permit the gifting of seven crates of antiquities to Canterbury Museum.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to learn that <em>New China Eyewitness</em> is on the longlist of the 2018 Ockham New Zealand Book Awards in the illustrated non-fiction category,” says Canterbury University Press publisher Catherine Montgomery. “Readers interested in 20th-century Chinese history, cultural diplomacy, the legacy of Rewi Alley, museum and curatorial studies or travel history will be captivated by the text and images within its pages.”</p>
<p><em>New China Eyewitness</em> is part of a larger research project centred on Canterbury Museum’s Rewi Alley Collection, which was supported by a Marsden grant. The book includes Chinese translation of the majority of the text, undertaken by Xiongbo Shi.</p>
