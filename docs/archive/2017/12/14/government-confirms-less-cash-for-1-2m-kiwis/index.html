<p>Government confirms less cash for 1.2m Kiwis</p>
<p>The Coalition Government’s legislation today to remove the tax threshold changes from Budget 2017 will mean less money for 1.2 million working Kiwis, National Party Finance Spokesperson Steven Joyce says.</p>
<p>“This bill means hard-working Kiwis on the average wage will no longer receive the $1060 extra money they were due to receive from 1 April next year,” Mr Joyce says.</p>
<p>“It is very strange for a Government that says it wants to increase the wages of hard-working Kiwis to start by taking more than a $1000 a year off them.</p>
<p>Mr Joyce says the savings the Government has made by cancelling the tax changes have all gone into providing a year’s free tertiary education, which will not be targeted to those most in need.</p>
<p>“It is wrong to take $1060 off average wage earners to give a year free tertiary education to lawyers and accountants.”</p>
<p>Mr Joyce says the decision means a majority of full-time Kiwi workers will face a marginal tax rate of at least 30 cents in the dollar for every additional dollar earned.</p>
<p>“This is a very high rate, especially when you add in GST and the abatement rates for programmes like Working for Families and the Accommodation Supplement.</p>
<p>“Kiwi families quickly get into the situation of paying more than half of any extra income they get in tax.</p>
<p>Mr Joyce says the package as a whole is overly complicated and poorly designed.</p>
<p>“National’s Family Incomes package was structured to lift 50,000 children out of poverty from April 1 next year. Labour’s 88,000 is not until 2021 by which time National would have undertaken its second similar package with a similar impact.</p>

<p>“Labour could have achieved the same result with a much simpler package that retains the tax cuts and provides better rewards for hard work.</p>
<p>“This bill complicates an already far too complicated tax and benefit system.</p>
<p>“Kiwis already get confused about what they are entitled to. This package makes it worse.</p>
<p>“We need to strengthen the link between work and income so that people know they get more when they work extra hours or change for a higher-paying job.”</p>
