<p><strong>Govt’s child poverty figures all smoke and mirrors</strong></p>
<p>The Government is hiding behind a smokescreen and is blustering about the number of children it plans to lift out of poverty, National’s spokesperson for Children Paula Bennett says.</p>
<p>“National’s Family Incomes Package was projected to lift 50,000 children out of poverty on 1 April 2018. It would have given 1.2 million working Kiwis an extra $1060 per year in the hand – and, we had committed to undertake a further package in 2020 that would have had a similar impact.</p>
<p>“The mini Budget announced by Labour today outlines its plans to lift 88,000 children out of poverty – but by 2021.</p>
<p>“So, comparing apples with apples, during the same period National would have lifted about 100,000 children out of poverty, whereas Labour only plans to lift 88,000.</p>
<p>“Labour has reverted to type by throwing billions of dollars at poorly targeted hand-outs, including over $3000 baby bonuses that go to everyone, irrespective of whether they need it or not.</p>
<p>“During our term in Government, the number of kids in material hardship fell by nearly 40 per cent to 135,000 in 2016.</p>
<p>“Thanks to the hard work, motivation and brave decisions of thousands of Kiwi parents, there are now 60,000 fewer children growing up in benefit-dependent households.</p>
<p>“Statistics like that can’t just be made up. We were the first Government in 40 years to lift benefits and the results are beginning to show.</p>
<p>“This is yet another example of a big-spending Labour Government that just cannot execute its ambitions,” Mrs Bennett says.</p>
