<p><strong>UC professor wins prestigious statistics award</strong></p>
<p>University of Canterbury Professor Jennifer Brown, Head of the School of Mathematics and Statistics, has won the 2017 Campbell Award of the New Zealand Statistical Association (NZSA).</p>
<p>The Campbell Award is the 69-year-old association’s premier whole-of-career award, aimed at recognising an individual’s sustained contribution to the promotion and development of statistics. Winners must excel in at least one of the following areas: statistical research, statistics education, major contributions to New Zealand through statistical projects, and a sustained record of leadership in, and service to, statistics in New Zealand.</p>
<p>NZSA awards committee convenor Professor Martin Hazelton said Professor Brown had a strong case in all the award criteria.</p>
<p>“This year’s winner is a leading researcher in statistical ecology, has led an excellent teaching programme in statistics at the University of Canterbury, and has been a superb servant of the New Zealand Statistical Association, having served as President from 2008-2011 and Convenor of the Awards Committee for over ten years prior to that,” he said.</p>
<p>NZSA President Ian Westbrooke of DOC’s Science and Technical Group presented the award to Professor Brown at the NZSA’s joint conference with the International Association for Statistical Computing this week.</p>
