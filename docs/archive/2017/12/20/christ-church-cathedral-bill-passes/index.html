<p>Christ Church Cathedral Bill passes</p>
<p>National Party List MP based on Christchurch Nicky Wagner has welcomed the passing of the Christ Church Cathedral Bill which will allow for the rebuild of Christ Church Cathedral.</p>
<p>“This Bill is an important step in the reinstatement of this Canterbury icon and part of the National-led Government’s package agreed in September. Christchurch can now move forward with the restoration of the building.</p>
<p>“It has taken a lot of work to get to this moment and this milestone in the city’s rebuild could not have been reached without a huge amount of work from a number of parties including the Christchurch City Council, the Anglican Synod, Church Property Trust, the Greater Christchurch Buildings Trust, and other community and heritage groups.</p>
<p>“It has been a long and difficult process from the original Miriam Dean report and the Cathedral Working Group report, through to the Government reinstatement offer and commitment from Christchurch City Council, and finally to this legislation.</p>
<p>“The Christchurch City Council has also confirmed its $10 million donation which is important to support the rebuild.</p>
<p>“I would also like to thank everyone who supported this process. Now that we are on track to reinstate the Cathedral it will be something that every person in Christchurch can be proud of.”</p>
