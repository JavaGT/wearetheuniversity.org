<p><strong>Scholarship to attract Māori and Pasifika young leaders</strong></p>
<p>A new Lincoln scholarship is hoping to draw young Māori and Pasifika leaders into tertiary study by reducing some of the costs of living on campus.</p>
<p>Coming on the back of the fees free announcement by the Government, the Lincoln University Māori and Pasifika Accommodation Scholarship offers up to 20 students $5000 towards their on-campus accommodation costs.</p>
<p>Applicants need to have demonstrated commitment to Māori or Pasifika leadership and advancement within their school or extended community.</p>
<p>Living costs have been identified as one of the barriers which may stop Māori and Pasifika embarking into tertiary study.</p>
<p>It is part of an overall strategy to increase the number of Māori and Pacifica students at Lincoln University, which includes pastoral and cultural support to create a home-like atmosphere on campus for those away from whānau.</p>
<p>Dr Dione Payne, Director, Kaiarahi Māori, said the intent of the scholarship is to support and encourage Māori and Pasifika students to achieve their aspirations for their whenua, whānau, hapū and iwi.</p>
<p>“Other measures include the implementation of the Poutama Whenua strategy that aims to have all Māori students engaged in internships with Māori businesses or entities.</p>
<p>“This allows students to gain valuable practical experience in their chosen field of study as well as encouraging Māori students to return to their hapū or iwi takiwa to support whenua related activities,” Dr Payne said.</p>
<p>One of the other initiatives is to deepen relationships with Māori and Pasifika stakeholders to support their identified research priorities.</p>
<p>The scholarships are a key component of Lincoln University’s Whenua Strategy (for Māori) and Motu Strategy (for Pasifika).  </p>
