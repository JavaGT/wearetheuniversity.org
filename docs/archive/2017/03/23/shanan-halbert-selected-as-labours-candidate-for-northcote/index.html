<p>Shanan Halbert selected as Labour’s 2017 candidate for Northcote</p>
<p>Shanan Halbert has been selected as the Labour Party candidate for Northcote for the 2017 General Election.</p>
<p>“I look forward to campaigning in Northcote on the issues that matter locally - transport, decent housing, health and education,” says Shanan Halbert.<br>“Northcote has a changing demographic, it’s a great place for young professionals like me who are first home buyers but still want good access to the city for work.”</p>
<p>Labour’s President, Nigel Haworth, said: “Shanan joins our growing list of energetic and fresh candidates who will stand for Labour in 2017. Our focus is on electing a strong, Labour-led government next year that will back the Kiwi Dream and build a better New Zealand.”<br>Shanan is an education professional with experience across the sector including secondary, tertiary and with the education unions. Locally he has been in leadership and governance roles at Northcote’s Hato Petera College. Currently he is head of Relationships and Recruitment at Te Wananga o Aotearoa.</p>
