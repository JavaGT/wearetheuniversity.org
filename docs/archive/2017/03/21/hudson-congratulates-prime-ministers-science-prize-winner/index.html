<p>Media statement</p>

<p><strong>Hudson congratulates Prime Minister’s Science Prize winner</strong></p>
<p>Ōhāriu-based National List MP, Brett Hudson, is delighted to hear a Prime Minister’s Science Prize has been awarded to Wellingtonian, and former Onslow College pupil, Catherine Pot.</p>
<p>Ms Pot was awarded the Prime Minister’s Future Scientist Prize for her research into the van der Pauw method, which is used in experimental semiconductor physics and worked to improve the technique so it can be more widely applied.</p>
<p>“Catherine is part of a new generation of Kiwi scientists,” Mr Hudson says. “It’s fantastic to see her recognised for her hard work and commitment to innovation.</p>
<p>“The prize will come with $50,000 for Catherine to use towards her Physics and Mathematics studies at Victoria University. Having carried out the original research at the age of 17, it will be interesting to see just how much she can achieve throughout her studies.</p>
<p>“Catherine marks the third person from Onslow College to win a Prime Minister’s Science Prize since the prizes were introduced in 2009. Onslow should be immensely proud of their commitment to science and the repeated recognition of the work of students and teachers goes to show how top-notch our Ōhāriu schools are.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister’s Science Prizes aim to celebrate the achievements of talented scientists in New Zealand and attract more young people into science careers. Catherine and the dynamic team at Onslow College make excellent ambassadors for the New Zealand science sector.”</p>
