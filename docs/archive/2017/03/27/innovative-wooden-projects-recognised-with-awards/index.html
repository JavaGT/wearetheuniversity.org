<p>L-R: Award winners Professor Andrew Barrie, Aaron Paterson, Amanda Wijaya, Dr Mike Davis, and Louie Tong.</p>
<p>Congratulations to our talented staff, students and recent graduates from the School of Architecture &amp; Planning who scooped up an unprecedented ten prizes at the 2017 NZ Wood Resene Timber Design Awards, including the prestigious Supreme Award.</p>
<p>Professor Andrew Barrie received the Resene Supreme Award for the design and implementation of a timber classroom block for Cathedral Grammar Junior School in Christchurch. This project was produced in collaboration with Tokyo-based Tezuka Architects, engineering firms Ruamoko Solutions and Ohno Japan, and Contract Construction.</p>
<p>The Resene Overall Supreme Award (highly commended) was won by Aaron Paterson, who teaches media courses at the School of Architecture and Planning, Paterson’s design firm, Paterson Architecture Collective, received for a house called Point Wells Gables, designed in collaboration with Steven Lloyd Architecture and Glamuzina Architects. The project also won the Residential Architectural Excellence category, and was highly commended in the Interior Innovation category.</p>
<p>Director of the architecture programme Dr Mike Davis, through his practice ARK, won the New Zealand Specialty Timber Award for Langs Doors in Northland, and his The Vessel project was highly commended in the same category.</p>
<p>The School of Architecture and Planning also received both of the awards in the student category. Postgraduate student Amanda Wijaya won an Innovation of Student Design Award for Marking the Journey of Tatau, and Louie Tong (now graduated) won for Multifunction: Pavilion.</p>
<p>Andrew Barrie’s Cathedral Grammar Junior School also won the Commercial Architectural Excellence Award, and was highly commended in the Engineering Innovation category. The building is open plan, beautifully revealing its method of construction. Made using laminated veneer timber, an engineered wood in which multiple thin layers of wood are glued together, a material that is a high performance alternative to solid lumber or steel for structural elements. “Cathedral Grammar stands out as an example of what can be achieved with effective collaboration and innovation in timber design, fabrication and construction. Outstanding BIM modelling and CNC machining was used to craft an integrated spatial and structural delight for its young occupants,” said the jury.</p>
<p>There were ten categories in this year’s awards, covering residential and commercial architectural excellence, innovation, novel applications of wood and student design. The school received ten of the 21 design awards presented across those categories at the gala awards ceremony last week. “This awards haul is without equal in the history of the School,” says Profesor Barrie, “and shows the strength of design currently in the programme, among both students and the teaching staff.”</p>
