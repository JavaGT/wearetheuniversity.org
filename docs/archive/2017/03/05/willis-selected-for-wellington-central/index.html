<p><strong>Sunday, 5 March 2017, 8:08 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Nicola Willis has been selected by National to contest the Wellington Central electorate at the 2017 General Election.</p>
<p>Ms Willis is a born and raised Wellingtonian, mother of four, and businesswoman, having previously held senior leadership roles at Fonterra.</p>
<p>“It’s a great honour to be selected and I’m grateful to the party membership. I’m excited about running a positive and high-energy campaign in my home city,” Ms Willis says.</p>
<p>“Wellington Central is a highly-educated, diverse and vibrant electorate with a strong sense of community and social conscience.</p>
<p>“I’m passionate about promoting Wellington’s future as a growing hub for tech and innovation, entrepreneurship, and community-minded people.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is a more positive and ambitious country, with an economy that is growing and becoming more diversified.</p>
<p>“This is no accident, and it is critical for our future success that we keep a National-led Government that can continue to back hard-working locals and families.</p>
<p>&quot;Bill English&#39;s united team will build on the successes of the last few years, with a plan to make Kiwis better off at work and at home, and the means to achieve it.</p>
<p>“I’ll be running a strong campaign to ensure Wellington Central has a voice inside a National-led Government that is helping the economy grow, building for future growth, and helping people most pressured by change.”</p>
