<p><strong>Monday, 20 March 2017, 3:13 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong><br>New Zealand First Leader<br>Member of Parliament for Northland</p>
<p>20 MARCH 2017</p>
<p><strong>MESSAGE TO APPLE: STOP THIS TAX DODGING CORPORATE RORT – BITE ON THAT</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is calling for better rules for government purchases given Apple, which fails to pay any tax here, has been the dominant supplier of mobile phones.</p>
<p>“Why would a government spend taxpayers’ money with a foreign corporation which manipulates the system so it does not pay a fair share of tax in New Zealand,” says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“These companies reduce what tax they owe in New Zealand through complex ‘related party finance transactions.’ Why would the New Zealand taxpayer buy off a company that is prepared to milk this country and give nothing back in return.</p>
<p>“Why do some global corporates pay tax on New Zealand earnings but Apple doesn’t? Every year government departments will buy well over a thousand Apple devices - 1,381 in 2014/15 alone - and this doesn’t include District Health Boards or other agencies.</p>
<p>“The way some Ministers talk up Apple you’d think they were on commission.</p>
<p>“And it’s not just Apple because FujiXerox has been favoured by this government and also does a Robin Hood in reverse - it takes from the poor Kiwi taxpayer to give to its rich multinational paymaster.</p>
<p>“Government procurement rules need to change after almost nine years of National doing nothing, and claiming they were in discussions with the OECD,” says Mr Peters.</p>
