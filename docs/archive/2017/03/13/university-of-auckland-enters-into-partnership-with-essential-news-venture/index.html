<p>13 March 2017</p>
<p>The University of Auckland is a leading supporter of <em>Newsroom</em>, a new independent current affairs and news website.</p>
<p><em>Newsroom</em> is being developed by former head of news at MediaWorks (which includes television channel <em>Three</em>) Mark Jennings, and Tim Murphy, former editor-in-chief of the <em>New Zealand Herald</em>.  The website, which launched today, has an editorial team of 16 based in Auckland and Wellington.  </p>
<p>The University, as a founding partner of the news venture, will provide high-quality content and expert commentary for the site. It will join Holden New Zealand, telecommunications company Chorus, and Victoria University of Wellington as initial sponsors.</p>
<p>University of Auckland Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stuart McCutcheon says the University is uniquely placed to provide informed content and research-based analysis on issues which are critical to the country&#39;s future.</p>
<p>“In this rapidly changing world there is an appetite for high-grade, trusted content and our researchers and academics are already leaders in providing authoritative and informed news and expert commentary.</p>
<p>“<em>Newsroom</em> is committed to credible and balanced journalism, and this is an opportunity for us to work together and generate a thoughtful New Zealand perspective, which adds to a broader global view. We also look forward to working with Victoria University on this initiative.”</p>
<p>Mark Jennings says universities have a vital role in informing the public.</p>
<p>“An ill-informed public threatens the democratic underpinnings of our society and economy.  The University has a charter to communicate its work as far as it can, and that combined with the high-calibre of its research and expert opinion makes it an ideal, independent source of information and analysis.”</p>
<p><em>Newsroom</em>, a free, open site, launched today Monday 13 March. At the same time, a paid, subscription news feed, <em>Newsroom Pro</em>, will launch for corporates, professional services firms, public agencies and other organisations wanting up-to-the-minute news intelligence on a range of subject areas.</p>
