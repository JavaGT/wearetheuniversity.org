<p>The University of Auckland Business School has once again been ranked the best university in New Zealand to study Accounting and Finance, Commercial Law, Business and Management, Property, Economics and Information Systems.</p>
<p>The QS World University Rankings by Subject is a highly regarded international ranking system that releases its 2017 rankings today.</p>
<p>The QS subject areas are taught across a range of departments and schools within the Business School. For the QS subject area “Accounting and Finance”, the University of Auckland was ranked 37th in the world. For “Business and Management Studies”, Auckland came in the top 100 out of 1070 institutions, and for “Economics and Econometrics”, it was ranked in the top 100 out of 917 institutions.</p>
<p>Some subjects taught in the Business School are included in other QS subject areas, in which the University of Auckland also led New Zealand. Commercial Law was included in the QS subject “Law”, which came 36th in the world. Information Systems is included in “Computer Science and Information Systems”, and Property comes under “Architecture and Built Environment”, for both of which the University ranked in the top 100 internationally.</p>
<p>Dean of the Business School, Professor Jayne Godfrey, says: “We are pleased to see our status as New Zealand’s leading Business School reinforced in these subject rankings. The rankings are underpinned by the talent and hard work of both our staff and our students. They reflect the relevance and quality of research undertaken in the business school, the breadth and depth of our educational offerings and staff commitment to teaching excellence.”</p>
<p>Overall the University of Auckland was confirmed as the best performing in the country holding top place in 37 subjects.</p>
<p>The QS Rankings by Subject results were based on survey responses from over 305,000 academics and 194,000 employers, and analysis of over 43 million research papers and over 185 million citations sourced from the Scopus/Elsevier bibliometric database.</p>
