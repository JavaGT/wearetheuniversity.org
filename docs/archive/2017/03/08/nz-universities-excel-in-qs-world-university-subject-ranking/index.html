<p><strong>Wednesday, 8 March 2017, 9:48 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Universities_New_Zealand_-_Te_Pokai_Tara">Universities New Zealand - Te Pokai Tara</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>NZ universities excel in QS World University Subject rankings</strong></p>
<p>7 March 2017 – <strong>Embargoed by QS until Wednesday 8 March 2017 at 07:01 NZST</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand has again excelled in the latest world university rankings, being placed in the top 50 universities in the world in 22 different subjects, and in the top 100 in 39 (out of a possible 46) subjects.</p>
<p>“These are outstanding results for a country with eight universities being evaluated against 4,430 other universities from around the world”, says Executive Director of Universities New Zealand Chris Whelan. “They reflect the high regard in which our universities’ teaching and research is held across a wide range of disciplines.”</p>
<p>The annual QS World University Rankings by Subject compares academic reputation, employer reputation, research citations, and impact.</p>
<p>Chris Whelan says rankings have become very influential tools. “It’s not about institutional vanity - it’s about their international reputation. Rankings strongly influence decisions being made by students, as well as countries, top researchers and research institutes about who they will, or won’t, study or work with.”</p>
<p>However, Chris Whelan warns against complacency.</p>
<p>“Between this year and last year, the eight universities collectively saw improvements in 24 subject rankings and maintained their rankings in 64 subjects, but we also saw drops in 55 subject rankings.</p>
<p>“This overall decline is mainly a consequence of low institutional funding levels by international standards. With funding now below the OECD average per student, New Zealand universities are struggling to maintain quality compared with the countries that receive above average funding – like Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>

<p>New Zealand spends US$15,400 per student, relative to an OECD average of US$16,200. Other countries are recognising the importance of higher education, research and innovation to drive prosperity and enhance well-being.”</p>
<p>He says, “This year’s ranking results are evidence of the real commitment of New Zealand universities to delivering teaching, learning and research of the highest international standards. However, they do so under immense and growing pressure. Keeping pace with our peers gets harder each year”.</p>
<p>If we want the universities to continue to rise in the subject rankings, and so give our students even better educational experiences, the nation will have to be prepared to invest in them.</p>
