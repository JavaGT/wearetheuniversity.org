<p><strong>Wednesday, 8 March 2017, 5:47 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Andrew Little<br>Leader of the Opposition</p>
<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>7 March 2017</p>
<p>David Clark takes over health role</p>
<p>Dunedin North MP David Clark succeeds Annette King as Health Spokesperson as part of a minor reallocation of portfolios announced today by Labour Leader Andrew Little.</p>
<p>“David has been Associate Spokesperson for some time and has worked closely with Annette in this important portfolio so I’m very confident he will do well in this role.</p>
<p>“A Labour Government will reverse National’s health cuts and David’s skills and experience will be invaluable in communicating to the electorate how Labour will fix the health system.</p>
<p>“Stuart Nash takes over David’s Economic Development (including Regional Development) portfolio and David Parker picks up his Trade and Export Growth role.</p>
<p>“Megan Woods has been a strong performer in her Climate Change and Canterbury Issues roles and picks up Stuart’s Energy, Innovation and Science, Research and Development portfolios.”</p>
<p>Among other changes:</p>
<p>· Peeni Henare gains State Owned Enterprises<br>· Raymond Huo, who is expected to join the Labour caucus next week, takes over the Land Information Role once sworn in<br>· Annette King is the new State Services Spokesperson<br>· Adrian Rurawhe moves into the Shadow Cabinet</p>
<p>“This completes changes triggered by Michael Wood’s election as Mt Roskill MP. Earlier this year Kris Faafoi was elected Senior Whip and Adrian Rurawhe, Caucus Secretary.</p>
<p>“The team I lead into this year’s election is strong and determined. We will be working hard to show New Zealanders that there is a better way that provides fairness and opportunity for all,” says Andrew Little.</p>
