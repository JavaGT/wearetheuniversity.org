<p>Lee to run for National in Maungakiekie</p>
<p>Denise Lee has been selected by National as its Maungakiekie candidate for the 2017 General Election.</p>
<p>Ms Lee is a proud mum and dedicated local who has lived in the area for close to 20 years. She currently serves on the Auckland Council representing the Maungakiekie-Tamaki ward, and has previous corporate experience in the United States.</p>
<p>“Maungakiekie is a place I’m deeply connected to, that I am proud to consider my home, so I’m thrilled to be selected,” Ms Lee says.</p>
<p>“The electorate takes in some incredibly diverse parts of Auckland, including Tamaki, Panmure, Penrose and Ellerslie. We’ve got hardworking families, great schools, and a huge range of fantastic local businesses.</p>
<p>“With my extensive local knowledge, I’m ready to hit the ground running and will be campaigning hard to ensure Maungakiekie continues to have an effective local MP working for them in Government.</p>
<p>“I’m grateful to outgoing MP Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga for his friendship, hardwork, and dedication to the area over the last few years. He’s been a tireless champion for both National and Maungakiekie.</p>
<p>“The National-led Government is helping the economy grow, building for future growth, and helping people most pressured by change.</p>
<p>&quot;I’m hoping to earn Maungakiekie’s trust to join Bill English&#39;s united team that will build on the successes of the last few years, with a plan to make Kiwis better off at work and at home, and the means to achieve it.”  </p>
