<p>Millions of Reasons for Northlanders to Be Angry - Peters</p>
<p>While the Electricity Authority and the National government are demanding Northpower and Top Energy customers pay over $9 million more for their power each year, the real cost on Northland’s biggest businesses takes the impact closer to $11 million.</p>
<p>“Northlanders have 10.6 million reasons to be angry and each is called a dollar,” says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“That’s why we have a petition circulating at the Northland Field Days demanding that Parliament look into the cockamamie Electricity Authority and its transmission pricing chicanery.</p>
<p>“It is bad enough that Northlanders could be $9.2m out of pocket from a power price jack-up that’s designed to pay for Transpower’s infrastructure. It gets worse when large prospective employers will look at our power charges and run a mile.</p>
<p>“The crazy thing is this – Transpower is meant to be a business, its grid upgrade has already been completed and yet Northland has suffered three power outages in the past four months on its supposedly upgraded infrastructure.</p>
<p>“This is all the National government’s doing and just to rub salt into our wounds, Transpower announced an interim dividend of $66m which goes to the government. This is a state-run dividend protection racket that Mafioso would approve of.</p>
<p>“As the government is deliberately turning a blind eye to these swingeing power price increases, the New Zealand First site at the Northland Field Days (Rural Pavilion 1, site 622), is hosting a petition to force action in Parliament.</p>

<p>“Unlike the government, we know power pricing affects not just economic development but thousands of Northlanders who struggle to make ends meet,” says Mr Peters.</p>
