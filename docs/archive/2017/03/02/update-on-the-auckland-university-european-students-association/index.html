<p>The University of Auckland understands and appreciates the concerns raised over a new student club, known as the Auckland University European Students Association. The University promotes a safe and inclusive campus environment, and while we believe in free speech we do not in any way condone hateful or discriminatory behaviour. </p>
<p>We understand that, in response to issues raised, the club is moving to change its slogan and has expressed regret over its choice of words. We would urge any student clubs, official or unofficial, not to engage in any discriminatory behaviour. </p>
<p>The University does not control student clubs. It is recommended that clubs go through the affiliation process with AUSA.</p>
<p>The Auckland University European Students Association is not formally affiliated to or supported by the University or AUSA. The affiliation process for new clubs is through the AUSA Student Forum where the student body can determine if a club is endorsed or not.</p>
<p>As the AUSA affiliation process does not occur for a couple of weeks after semester starts, it is normal practice to allow new (yet to be affiliated) clubs to attend Clubs Expo, so they don’t miss out on the opportunity to promote their club and sign-up members. Along with the Auckland University European Students Association there are four-five other new clubs this semester participating in Clubs Expo that have not yet gone through the affiliation process with AUSA.</p>
<p>The University is working with AUSA on the matter.</p>
<p>Students who feel concerned about this situation should contact the University support services which include:</p>
