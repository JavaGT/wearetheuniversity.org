<p>Victoria establishes Faculty of Health</p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington has established a Faculty of Health.</p>
<p>The Faculty will bring together existing researchers and teachers from across the University, and will focus on non-clinical, non-medical subjects such as health promotion, health policy and health service delivery as well as other subjects to be announced.</p>
<p>“Victoria already has considerable expertise in improving the health and wellbeing of our communities. The new Faculty of Health will combine this expertise with our traditional strengths in public policy, government and business to make a difference to New Zealand’s entire health system,” says Victoria’s Provost Professor Wendy Larner.</p>
<p>Professor Gregor Coster has been appointed the inaugural Dean of the Faculty of Health. Professor Coster is a graduate of the University of Otago Medical School, has a PhD in public policy from Victoria University, and is a former Professor of General Practice and Dean of Graduate Studies at the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>He currently chairs the WorkSafe New Zealand Board and until recently was a member of the Accident Compensation Corporation Board. Professor Coster has also chaired two district health boards, most recently the Counties Manukau District Health Board where he led significant reforms in health care service delivery, and has been deputy chair of Pharmac.</p>
<p>“I’m honoured to be appointed Dean, and am looking forward to leading the Faculty. It’s an exciting initiative and one we hope will make a significant difference to New Zealanders’ health and wellbeing,” Professor Coster says.</p>

<p>“We’re going to focus on training health sector professionals for the broader health system, and are planning to begin teaching undergraduate courses in Trimester One, 2018. We are also considering offering postgraduate programmes in future, in areas such as occupational health and safety, health management leadership.</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s health system underpins all our lives, and has great potential to improve the health and wellbeing of individuals and the wellbeing of society as a whole.</p>
<p>“We’re training professionals who can help ensure New Zealand’s future is a healthy one.”</p>
<p>A proposal for an undergraduate Bachelor of Health will be submitted shortly to Universities New Zealand’s Committee on University Academic Programmes.</p>
