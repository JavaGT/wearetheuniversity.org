<p><strong>Unaffordable housing sends teachers packing from Auckland</strong></p>
<p>Unaffordable housing is pushing teachers out of Auckland, with grim consequences for schools and students, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>Information released to the Green Party by the Ministry of Education shows the number of teachers leaving Auckland rose from 255 in 2015 to 390 in 2016, and principals and teachers are seriously concerned about the issue.</p>
<p>“Teachers work hard and are so important to their communities, they need to be able to afford a home of their own in our biggest city,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>“If teachers can’t afford to rent a home in Auckland, let alone buy one, what is going to happen to Auckland’s schools and the city’s children?</p>
<p>“The Ministry is hearing that young Auckland teachers have to either live at home with their parents or leave the city, they can’t even afford to rent a decent flat. That’s a sign of how bad the housing crisis has become.</p>
<p>“We want our best and brightest young people to consider becoming teachers but some are not going to do that if they know they’ll never be able to afford a home.</p>
<p>“Teachers and principals are asking the Ministry for help with affordable housing, which is more evidence that the housing market is broken.</p>
<p>“The Government really needs to step up and build thousands of affordable homes, crack down on overseas property investment, and dampen property speculation with a capital gains tax (excluding the family home),” Mrs Turei said.</p>
