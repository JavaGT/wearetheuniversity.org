<p>Hash Perambalam with Sam Neill</p>
<p>When University of Auckland film graduate Hash Perambalam won the Best Self-Funded Short Film award at the Rialto Channel NZ Film Awards she got a selfie with actor Sam Neill to celebrate.</p>
<p>Her film, <em>Not Like Her</em> was made as part of a year-long Masters in Screen Production thesis at the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>She received the award at the Rialto Channel NZ Film Awards - aka The Moas – held in Auckland last month.</p>
<p>“When they announced that we won best self-funded short we all screamed. I just gave a little speech and thanked everyone and said if anyone wanted to give me a job I wrote, directed and edited it. After the awards we got a selfie with Sam Neill with both our Moas together. I don&#39;t usually do things like that but I thought what the hell!” </p>
<p>The 14 minute short film is centred on female body image from the perspective of a rebellious teenage girl who is forced to spend the day with her estranged mother when she is suspended from school.</p>
<p>“I was thinking about women with extreme body image issues having teenage daughters and imagining what that might look like on a really bad day,” Hash says.</p>
<p>“It’s a sad thought to me, if you hate yourself and you hate how you look and then you have a daughter staring back at you…and she looks like you. People assume a mother’s love is so strong that it would shake you out of that kind of mind-set…but what if it can’t?”</p>
<p><em>Not Like Her</em> was produced by Hash, fellow graduate Lucy Stonex, and her Masters supervisor Brendan Donovan.</p>
<p>Brendan says the award is even more special as the category is open to all, not just students.</p>
<p>“So Hash was up against both developing and more established talent in the wider New Zealand film industry. Many films are self-funded these days and so even to be nominated was an achievement – to win is a reflection of the quality of Hash’s work. It’s not just a good student film, it’s a good film.”</p>
<p>Hash took a year to create the film, from developing the idea, writing the script, pre-production, filming, editing the film and other post-production. Apart from a small investment by her parents, she relied on favours, student discounts and fellow students crewing the film. The majority of the cast and crew worked on the film for free.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old from Auckland’s North Shore has not had time to rest. She’s already researching and writing another short film which she hopes to get funded, the subject is still top-secret though.</p>
