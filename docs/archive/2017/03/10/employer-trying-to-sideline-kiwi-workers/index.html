<p><strong>Friday, 10 March 2017, 10:47 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong><br>New Zealand First Leader<br>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>10 MARCH 2017</p>
<p><strong>Employer Trying to Sideline Kiwi Workers</strong></p>
<p>An employer in Opotiki is blatantly cutting out New Zealanders for a job at his service station by requiring a fluent Chinese speaker.</p>
<p>“This is a clear example of an employer taking advantage of record immigration and the thousands of unskilled migrants seeking jobs,” says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“This employer knows that migrants are cheaper to hire, and will work under any conditions just to keep a job because they want to stay in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“There is no shortage of workers in Opotiki and the rest of the Eastern Bay of Plenty.</p>
<p>“The advertisement on <a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz/jobs/marketing-media-communications/management/listing-1264690627.htm">TradeMe</a> discriminates against New Zealanders in favour of new migrants who have less understanding of fair wages and working conditions that New Zealand once prided itself on.</p>
<p>“We understand this employer is Chinese and lives in Auckland.</p>
<p>“With immigration running at new records each year under the National government, tens of thousands of migrants are competing with New Zealanders for jobs.</p>
<p>“National has allowed unfocused immigration, instead of targeting the skills we need.</p>
<p>“A service station manager should not be on the skills shortage list,” says Mr Peters.</p>
<p>The Bay of Plenty has 7600 registered unemployed.</p>
