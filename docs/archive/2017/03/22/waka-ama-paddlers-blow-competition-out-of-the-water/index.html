<p>The Faculty of Engineering has retained its title as University of Auckland Great Waka Ama race champions.</p>
<p>The gruelling outrigger canoe race was once again won by a crew of three female and three male engineering students on the Waitemata Harbour on March 19.</p>
<p>The victors convincingly beat six other faculty teams in a ten kilometre return paddle from Takapuna to Rangitoto Island, broken up by an eight kilometre sprint to the summit of Rangitoto and back.</p>
<p>“On the way back when we were approaching the finish line we all zoned in and pushed together to the end, and the boat felt really good,” says crew member Georgia Naera, who has been involved in Waka Ama since she was seven-years-old.</p>
<p>Teammate Dallas Watene, who has competed since his early teens, says this year’s crew has a strong dynamic.</p>
<p>“When we were paddling back to Takapuna there was a real mix of excitement and trying not to capsize for the team when we realised we were in the lead,” he said.</p>
<p>Up for grabs was one of the greatest prizes in the University sporting community, an all-expenses paid trip to Hawai’i to compete in the world’s largest long-distance outrigger canoe competition, the Queen Lili’uokalani Memorial race.</p>
<p>As the current world title-holder of the main open mixed category of the Queen Lili’uokalani Memorial race, the team will be tasked with defending the University of Auckland’s title in Hawai’i in August.</p>
<p>The crew will begin training three times a week at Okahu Bay and on the Waitemata Harbour from next week to build up the stamina and team camaraderie required for the 30km open water event.</p>
<p>This year’s crew has experience on its side, with Waka Ama stalwarts Dallas and Georgia, Nona Taute, Josie Stevens, and Billy Bowman all members of the outstanding 2016 crew which won in Hawai’i.</p>
<p>They are joined by new crew members Sarah Carson, Vaoala Enesa and Jessica Retter, who are all new to the sport.</p>
<p>“A few new paddlers this year have been initiated into the team which has been awesome. A really bubbly fun vibe has taken over the team which will hopefully continue all the way until Hawai’i!,” says Josie, who took up the sport last year.</p>
<p>A Waka Ama crew must be made up of three females and three males, along with two reserves.</p>
