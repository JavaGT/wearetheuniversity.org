This includes a plan to open an innovation lab at Victoria University of Wellington and commitments to work with local tech firms.<br> <br>&quot;This is a huge boost to Wellington&#39;s tech sector and confirms our place as a global hub for digital innovation,” Ms Willis says.<br> <br>&quot;Wellington&#39;s tech sector is growing fast and we have New Zealand&#39;s highest concentration of web and digital businesses.<br> <br>&quot;The innovation lab will be at the cutting edge of tomorrow&#39;s tech possibilities like 5G cell phone networks, big data and the Internet of things.<br> <br>&quot;Huawei chose Wellington because we are a smart place with a track record of turning ideas into reality.<br> <br>&quot;This investment means more and better paying jobs for Wellingtonians. Our tech sector is a magnet for innovators and ideas people from all over the world.<br> <br>“The National-led Government has made it a priority to invest in our hi-tech industries, so that it is now one of our fastest growing sectors.<br> <br>“We’ve committed $411 million through the Innovative New Zealand package, and are working to lift total government investment in science and innovation to $1.6 billion by 2020.<br> <br>“Only under the leadership of Bill English and National will Wellington Central have a team that knows how to grow the economy, invest for future growth, and ensure we are supporting more Wellingtonians to benefit from this growth.”   </p>
