<p><strong>Saturday, 29 April 2017, 1:23 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>National completes 2017 candidate selection</strong>  </p>
<p>National has finished selecting its candidates for the 2017 General Election with the list ranking process now underway, Party President Peter Goodfellow says.</p>
<p>“National has had great success refreshing its caucus over the last few years, meaning our team is now one of the strongest I can remember,” Mr Goodfellow says.</p>
<p>“As we head into the 2017 campaign, we have selected 20 exciting new candidates who will be fighting hard for the Party Vote and their electorate, ready to contribute to a strong and stable National Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Bill English.</p>
<p>“The new group are from incredibly diverse backgrounds, including farmers, scientists, military officers, pilots, businesspeople, lawyers, police officers, and community advocates.</p>
<p>“We have new candidates who are mothers, fathers, grandparents, Maori, Filipino, Indian, Samoan, Canadian, and European – all proud New Zealanders, and committed to serving their communities as strong advocates in a National Government that gets results.”</p>
<p>The list ranking process is now underway, with all 64 candidates meeting local National Party members across the country. It is expected the final list will be released in early August.</p>
<p>“This National-led Government has been working hard to grow the economy, build for future growth, and help people most pressured by change,” Mr Goodfellow says.</p>
<p>“New Zealand will not achieve a brighter future by accident and under an unstable Labour-Greens Government with a weak leader we risk going backwards, and losing all we have fought so hard to achieve.</p>

<p>“Bill English, and his united team, will build on the successes of the last few years, with a clear and strong plan to make Kiwis better off at work and at home, with the means to achieve it.”  </p>
