<p>Waikato Mourns Tomairangi Paki</p>
<p>It is with profound sadness that the iwi of Waikato mourn the loss of Tomairangi Paki, the second eldest daughter of the late Maori Queen Te Arikinui Te Atairangikaahu.</p>
<p>Tomairangi was raised for most of her life at Waahi Paa in Huntly with her siblings.</p>
<p>She attended the local native school Rakaumanga in her hometown and then was sent to Waikato Diocesan School for Girls in Hamilton. Tomai is affectionately remembered for her effervescence, a love of kapahaka and a sharp wit.</p>
<p>However her particular contribution to the revitalisation of kapahaka through Taniwharau the Maori cultural group founded to support the aspirations of the Kiingitanga was an important achievement.</p>
<p>Tomairangi was renowned for innovating modern dance and music styles with kapahaka. She learnt traditional hula studying in Hawaii and returned an appreciation of hula to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Tomairangi received a lifetime recognition for her service and contribution to kapahaka in Tainui waka.</p>
<p>Later in life she experienced several health problems and a level of physical disability which did not prevent her from travelling the country to support her love and passion for cultural arts and kapahaka. Her appreciation for the contribution of kapahaka to lift self-esteem and cultural identity saw her forge lifetime relationships with leading lights of the kapahaka world.</p>
<p>She is survived by her son Turongo and daughter Marakopa Paki and several mokopuna.</p>
<p>Waikato remembers her legacy and contribution as the formal farewell speeches continue to flood her home Marae in Huntly.</p>
<p>No reira Kiritokia e te Tomairangi e moe, takoto pai mai. Pai Marire.</p>
<p>The funeral service will be held at Waahi Paa, Huntly 7th April 2017.</p>
