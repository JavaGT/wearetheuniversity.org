<p>“I’m proud to live in Dunedin South – it’s made up of some truly fantastic communities, so I’m excited about standing for National here,” Mr Gregory says.</p>
<p>“New Zealand and the Dunedin area is growing strongly, and we’re benefiting from the leadership National has shown in Government.</p>
<p>“As local MP, I would be a tireless voice for the Dunedin South electorate in a Government that is working to sustain that growth, build for growth, and act for the people most pressured by change.</p>
<p>“Dunedin South deserves a strong local voice in a Bill English-led National Government with a strong plan to make Kiwis better off at work and at home, with the means to achieve it.</p>
<p>“I’ll be running a vigorous campaign focused on the issues that matter to local families and businesses, like ensuring we continue to invest in health, housing, education, and vital transport infrastructure.”</p>
<p>The Dunedin South Electorate covers South Dunedin, Mosgiel, Outram and stretches inland to Middlemarch and the Longburn Reservoir. National won the party vote at the 2014 General Election with a close to 2,500 vote majority.</p>
