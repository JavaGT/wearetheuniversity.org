<p>National has chosen Andrew Falloon to contest the Rangitata electorate at the 2017 General Election.</p>
<p>Originally from Ashburton, Mr Falloon was born and raised in the electorate. He has extensive experience in government and government relations in New Zealand and currently works as an Associate Director at the New Zealand Bankers Association.</p>
<p>“It’s a great honour being chosen by local National members to run for Parliament in my home electorate,” Mr Falloon says.</p>
<p>“Rangitata, or Mid and South Canterbury, is deeply a part of who I am and my family’s history. I know our communities well – their aspirations, and the challenges they face.</p>
<p>“National has backed regions like ours through economic and natural crises, helping people to get back on their feet, get into jobs, all while getting New Zealand back into surplus.</p>
<p>“The Rangitata electorate benefits from National’s responsible financial management because it gives us real choices so we can invest in the areas that matter to local families.</p>
<p>“National is focused on sustaining growth, building for future growth, and helping those people most pressured by change.</p>
<p>“Bill English and his united team understand the needs of the Rangitata electorate, and I will be working hard to earn the trust of our local communities to represent them in a National team that will build on the successes of the last few years.</p>

National has held the seat since its creation in 2008, and at the last election won the Party Vote with an over 12,000 vote majority.</p>
