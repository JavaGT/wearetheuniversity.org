<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>20 April 2017</p>
<p>Inflation data shows many New Zealanders are worse off under National</p>
<p>The latest inflation data from Statistics New Zealand shows that too many New Zealanders are now worse off under the National Government, said Labour’s Finance Spokesperson Grant Robertson</p>
<p>“Consumer Price Inflation (CPI) is now running at 2.2 per cent, and it is the very basics that are running higher.</p>
<p>“Fruit and Vegetables is 4.4 per cent higher. Property rates are up 3.3 per cent. Primary and Secondary education costs rose 2.8 per cent. Housing and Household utilities rose 3.3 per cent. Transport prices rose 3.5 per cent. Increases in these core expenditure areas hit the poorest hardest.</p>
<p>“However, wages are running far behind that number, meaning that the cost of living gets harder and harder for New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“According to the latest information, average hourly earnings rose just 1.3 per cent last year, 66 per cent of Kiwi workers got less than 2 per cent wage increase last year, and 45 per cent got no pay rise at all.</p>
<p>“National can no longer hide behind the headline figure of a growing economy. GDP was down last quarter. Unemployment is up and now stands at 140,000. Ninety thousand young people are not in work, education or training. The cost of housing is spiralling. Success for Bill English and Steven Joyce does not mean success for most New Zealanders.<br>“It’s time for a Labour Government that cares about the needs of New Zealanders and helps them share in the prosperity of a growing economy.</p>
<p>“National has no vision for the economy and has no plan or ideas for the future – except for allowing speculators to keep making money in the housing market,” says Grant Robertson.</p>
