<p><strong>Sunday, 30 April 2017, 2:31 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Sue Moroney to stand down at General Election</p>
<p>Labour List MP Sue Moroney will not seek re-election to Parliament in September, the Hamilton-based MP announced today.</p>
<p>“I made my decision after being notified last night that I had lost support from the party’s ruling council for an electable position on the Labour Party list. I intend to serve out the remainder of the Parliamentary term.</p>
<p>“I am grateful that I have had the opportunity to fight for the rights of children, working families, women and the people of Hamilton.</p>
<p>“I’m proud to have extended paid parental leave, achieved mandated meal breaks and rest periods for workers and fought early childhood education cuts amongst other things.</p>
<p>“Many people have given me invaluable support in these endeavours.</p>
<p>“It has been a true honour to represent the membership of the New Zealand Labour Party who I hold in the highest regard.</p>
<p>“Advocating for the people of Hamilton and the greater Waikato Region has given me precious insights into the importance of our region.</p>
<p>“I now look forward to spending more time with my amazing family and friends to plan the next chapter of my life in pursuing equality and social justice.</p>
<p>“I will not be making further comment.”</p>
<p>Labour Leader Andrew Little said he understood her reasons for standing down.<br>“Sue has been a hard-working and dedicated MP who can look back with pride on her achievements during her 12 years in Parliament.</p>
<p>“She has made a real difference. Sue campaigned tirelessly for a fairer deal for parents over paid parental leave and fought for greater protections for workers. More recently she has been an energetic spokesperson on transport and ACC issues, and worked hard advocating for the people of Hamilton.</p>
<p>“We will certainly miss her contribution in the Labour caucus and wish her all the best for the future.”</p>
