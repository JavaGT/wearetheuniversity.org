<p>A major research trial by the University of Auckland’s School of Population Health has found that taking higher doses of vitamin D once a month won’t lower your risk of heart disease.</p>
<p>The trial, led by the University’s Dr Robert Scragg, a professor of epidemiology, was conducted over three years using roughly 5,100 adults.</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among people with low levels of vitamin D. But earlier, randomised clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation have not found an effect, possibly because of using too low a dose of vitamin D.</p>
<p>The researchers tracked the heart health of roughly 5,100 adults aged between 50 and 84 from April 5, 2011, through November 6, 2012, with follow-ups until July 2015. The participants were mostly from family practices in Auckland.</p>
<p>About one-quarter were vitamin D deficient at the start of the trial - registering vitamin D levels of less than 50 nanomoles per litre via blood tests.</p>
<p>Half the group received a high-dose vitamin D supplement once a month, with an initial dose of 200,000 International Units (IUs). That was followed by a regular monthly dose of 100,000 IUs. The other half received a monthly regimen of placebo supplements.</p>
<p>The trial continued for more than three years, on average.</p>
<p>But in the end, nearly 12 percent of both groups had developed some form of heart disease, the researchers found. And the risk for developing high blood pressure and/or experiencing a heart attack, stroke, heart failure or angina was more or less the same whether or not a participant had begun the study deficient in vitamin D.</p>
<p>The findings were published in the April 5 issue of JAMA Cardiology.</p>
<p>“While the findings rule out monthly dosing of the vitamin for preventing cardiovascular disease, the effects of daily or weekly dosing require further study” Dr Scragg says.</p>
<p>“On-going research also will determine within the next three to four years whether vitamin D supplements prevent other diseases.”</p>
<p>The possibility that UV radiation, through a mechanism that involves vitamin D, may protect against cardiovascular disease was initially proposed in 1981. Results from recent meta-analyses have confirmed that people with low vitamin D status have increased risk of CVD.</p>
<p>The theory that vitamin D is protective against heart disease has been around since the 1980s. Natural sources of vitamin D include ultraviolet radiation from the sun and researchers noticed that the rates of cardiovascular disease were much higher in the winter when the body had lower levels of vitamin D.</p>
<p>Vitamin D is also found in foods such as fatty fish, fortified dairy and egg yolks.
