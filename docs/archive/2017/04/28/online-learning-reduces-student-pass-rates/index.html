<p><strong>Friday, 28 April 2017, 1:30 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tracey Martin MP</strong><br><strong>Spokesperson for Education</strong><br>28 APRIL 2017</p>
<p><strong>ONLINE LEARNING REDUCES STUDENT PASS RATES</strong></p>
<p>The Correspondence School’s decision to move all their courses online puts the education of too many students at risk, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“Moving to a 100 percent online at home learning environment means students in both rural and urban communities can’t access internet will miss out,” says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“As the Correspondence School has been moving towards full online learning and away from the traditional paper-based resources, fewer students are achieving NCEA qualifications.</p>
<p>“Results show that last year, there was a 10 per cent decline in students achieving NCEA level 1 through the Correspondence School.</p>
<p>“It’s alarming that with statistics like this, Minister Kaye, who talks about Community Of Online Learning (COOL) supplementing traditional schools, is still intent on passing legislation that allows students to choose to learn fully online.</p>
<p>“This move by the government is appalling, especially when there is so much evidence from overseas that shows just how bad this model is, and now we also have some New Zealand data,” says Mrs. Martin.</p>
