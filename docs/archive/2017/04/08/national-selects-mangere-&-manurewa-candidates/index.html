<p><strong>Saturday, 8 April 2017, 11:27 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National selects Mangere &amp; Manurewa candidates</p>
<p>National has selected two new Auckland candidates, with Agnes Loheni in Mangere and Katrina Bungard in Manurewa.</p>
<p>Ms Loheni, of Samoan descent, runs a successful Pacific clothing brand. Mrs Bungard is a teacher and Head of Department at Elim College, and serves on the Counties Manukau District Health Board.</p>
<p>“Mangere is a vibrant and positive place, with hard-working families and businesses succeeding not locally but around the world,” Ms Loheni says.</p>
<p>“National believes in Mangere, which is why it is investing in vital infrastructure like roading and new schools, improving housing, and improving social services.</p>
<p>“I have extensive ties to Mangere so I am really excited to be running here to give our communities the strong National voice they deserve.”</p>
<p>Mrs Bungard says she is honoured to be selected and is looking forward to getting out on the campaign trail for National in Manurewa.</p>
<p>“Bill English and his united National team are working hard to grow the local Manurewa and Auckland economy, build for future growth, and support people most pressured by change.</p>
<p>“Manurewa is getting ahead under National, and it deserves an MP that is aspirational for the area, understands local issues, and knows what it takes to get ahead.”</p>
