<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>7 April 2017</p>
<p>First-in-family scholarship inspires others to see university as a possibility</p>
<p>When you have no family history of university attendance, or come from a community where higher education is not the norm, the challenges of making it ‘across the stage’ are manifold.</p>
<p>This year, 13 remarkable students from South Auckland have started studying towards bachelors degrees at Auckland University of Technology (AUT) as recipients of the third annual Woolf Fisher First-in-Family AUT Scholarship.</p>
<p>They are the first in their immediate families to attend university.</p>
<p>This move into unchartered territory represents a steep learning curve, both for the recipients of the scholarship as well as their families.</p>
<p>First-in-family students affect intergenerational change. Going to university signals a new educational cycle for the wider family – it encourages other family members to view higher education as a possibility.</p>
<p>Laryia Lomitusi, age 18, was recently awarded a Woolf Fisher First-in-Family AUT Scholarship.</p>
<p>The former deputy head girl from Tangaroa College in South Auckland is now working towards a Bachelor of Health Science at AUT.</p>
<p>As the eldest of seven children, she feels it is her responsibility to lead by example.</p>
<p>“My goal is to increase Pacific representation in the health sector. Also, to use the knowledge and skills that I gain to help my community in Otara and those back in Samoa,” says Lomitusi.</p>
<p>For her, the prospect of graduating with minimal debt makes all of the sacrifice and late-night study worthwhile.</p>

<p>The scholarship covers direct study costs for the duration of an undergraduate degree at AUT, with a nominal value of around NZ$20,000.</p>
<p>This year, nine of the 13 scholarship recipients were of Pacific descent.</p>
<p>Preference was given to applicants from South Auckland who demonstrated a commitment to bringing about change in their community.</p>
<p>AUT Vice-Chancellor, Derek McCormack says the University is proud to have partnered with the Woolf Fisher Trust to establish this scholarship.</p>
<p>“We want to encourage young New Zealanders to follow their dreams – to experience success in their chosen field of study and inspire others to attend university,” he says.</p>
<p>“AUT is committed to widening participation in university education and the Woolf Fisher First-in-Family AUT Scholarship is part of that commitment.”</p>
