<p>National Favouring Migrants Ahead of Young Kiwis</p>
<p>The National government is giving up and turning their backs on thousands of young Kiwis who are desperate to get a job and future in their own country in favour of migrants, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“We have 139,000 Kiwis who don’t have a job; we have 91,000 young Kiwis who are not in education, training or employment and yet next to nothing is being done to sort out these problems.</p>
<p>“Instead of helping young Kiwis, the government allows thousands of migrants to pour into the country at a rate that will one day put New Zealand in the Guinness Book of Records.</p>
<p>“In the March 2017 year there has been yet another record annual net gain of 71,900 migrants.</p>
<p>“Month after month, year after year we have seen record numbers of migrants entering New Zealand.</p>
<p>“In the year to June 2016 New Zealand’s population grew by 97.300 to 2.1 percent which was the largest annual increase on record.</p>
<p>“Instead of sorting out work problems for thousands of Kiwis the government is using migrants to drive down working conditions and artificially inflate GDP growth figures.</p>
<p>“They are allowing a corrupt international education industry to thrive even though it is used by many overseas students as a ticket to residence – it has nothing to do with education.</p>
<p>“The government perpetuates the myth the country needs skilled labour but most of the new arrivals work in low-skilled, low-paid occupations,” says Mr Peters.</p>
