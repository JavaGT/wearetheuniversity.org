<p><strong>Wednesday, 19 April 2017, 2:56 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong><br>New Zealand First Leader<br>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>19 APRIL 2017</p>
<p><strong>EXPERTS WRONG AGAIN ON FLOOD-LED GLOBAL MILK PRICE SPIKE</strong></p>
<p>With the NZX Dairy Futures prediction for Whole Milk Powder reportedly out by up to 41%, NZ First questions what the point of GlobalDairyTrade is anymore.</p>
<p>“After Fonterra turned Eeyore over the impact of the floods on milk production, the so-called experts were beating their chest about a big, up to 6% lift in Whole Milk Powder (WMP) prices, but were wrong yet again,” says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“The TAB would be better and while this morning’s 3.5% Whole Milk Powder (WMP) uplift is welcome, we’re still to see prices back at where they were on 21 February. In fact, this latest auction result sees WMP trading US$264 a metric ton under the 21 February price and US$668 under the 6 December 2016 season peak.</p>
<p>“That’s the problem with GlobalDairyTrade. It has become a huge fortnightly distraction where farmer morale ebbs and flows like water.</p>
<p>“Since Fonterra only sells a fraction of product through GDT, NZ First asks if GDT is a dangerously redundant tail wagging the industry’s dog. Straight WMP averages on GDT tell us this season is only marginally ahead of 2014/15’s $4.40 payout.</p>
<p>“With speculation this season’s payout is holding or expected to exceed $6 before dividends, GDT is no longer even a reliable ‘price discovery’ guide.</p>

<p>“And the flooded farmers of Bay and Plenty and Waikato, whose winter feed has been destroyed will basically say ‘whatever.’ It is all academic if you cannot milk.</p>
<p>“And just where is Minister Guy or National’s local MP’s offering practical support?</p>
<p>“Waikato Regional Councillor Stu Husband has been on farms mucking-in but National’s a no-show in Waikato and with winter upon us, this so-called National government needs to do a lot better than that,” says Mr Peters.</p>
