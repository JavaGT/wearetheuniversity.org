<p>Budget funds must be allocated for pay equity claims</p>
<p>19 April 2017</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa is calling on the government to show good faith to women working in public sector jobs by allocating Budget funds to cover upcoming pay equity claims.</p>
<p>NZEI National Secretary Paul Goulter said yesterday’s government announcement of a $2 billion package to lift the wages of 55,000 care workers was a fantastic breakthrough for pay equity.</p>
<p>“However, this is just the beginning of the story, as women working in scores of female dominated industries are lining up for justice, including our members working as Education Support Workers for the Ministry of Education. We are currently in mediation with the ministry on their claim.</p>
<p>&quot;Education support workers are paving the way for other women working in education. Thousands of women working as teacher aides, and support staff in schools, are next in line for pay equity talks, with ECE teachers close behind.<br>“The Government has said it&#39;s committed to pay equality for women. We’re asking for assurances from the government that funds will be set aside in the upcoming Budget to ensure there is money to make fair pay for women a reality.</p>
<p>&quot;No one wants to see the required funding having to be pulled from already-strained public services such as education and health,” he said.</p>
