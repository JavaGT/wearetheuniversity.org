<p><strong>6 April 2017</strong><br><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Student support failing to keep up with rising housing costs: report</strong></p>
<p>Students are calling for urgent relief as rent prices soar to record-highs, a recent report by the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) has found.</p>
<p>‘The $217.03 Student Allowance and Accommodation. Benefit provides little relief when students are paying $250 per week on rent alone’, says National Student President Jonathan Gee.</p>
<p>The <em>Income and Expenditure Report 2017</em> has found that average rents in Auckland have increased by almost $75 per week in the last five years, from $175 to $250 for a room in a three bedroom house.</p>
<p>Gee says that student hardship has grown considerably worse since 2011.</p>
<p>‘That year, the Government froze the parental income threshold for eligibility, a significant factor in locking out 24,000 students from having access to the Student Allowance.’</p>
<p>‘Today, only a third of full-time students receive the Student Allowance. The rest borrow week to week in order to live and add to the national student loan balance of over $15 billion.’</p>
<p>‘It’s no wonder why repayment times are increasing as graduates begin their careers with unmanageable debt.’</p>
<p>‘It’s time for the Government to unfreeze the parental income threshold for eligibility, and raise the Student Allowance.’</p>
<p><strong>A mental health crisis in tertiary education</strong><br>The Report also finds that a third of students do not have enough income to afford their basic needs.</p>

<p>‘This alarming figure is further proof that a mental health crisis exists within tertiary education. Students are saying that they’re sick of having hunger and financial distress impact on education they already pay so much for.’</p>
<p><strong>Locked out from degree-level study</strong><br>The Report also finds that the tertiary population is looking less like the general population, despite all initiatives to make it look more like it.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of decile 8-10 students who achieve University Entrance end up attending degree-level study, compared to just a third of those from decile 1-3 schools.</p>
<p>If you’re in tertiary education, you’re also three times more likely to have attended a private school compared to the rest of the population.</p>
<p>‘Tertiary education should represent the make-up of the general population. Unfortunately the cost of education, coupled with limited student support, makes this education simply a dream for many.’</p>
<p>‘We’re calling for the Government to introduce a national ‘first in family’ scholarship, to break the poverty cycle and improve opportunity for all.’</p>
