<p>The University was closed on Thursday 13 April 2017 due to the forecast of adverse weather. This decision was made to ensure the safety of staff and students in light of information at the time.</p>
<p>We encouraged everyone to follow the official advice from Civil Defence and monitor Met Service information. Take care everyone and stay safe.</p>
<p>All lectures, tutorials, labs and other teaching events were cancelled from 11am. Tests scheduled for Thursday were also cancelled. If students were due to submit course work on Thursday, please do so electronically. If you cannot submit electronically please contact your Course Coordinator. Please monitor CANVAS for course updates. Further advice will be provided next week on rescheduling of tests.</p>
