<p>Media statement</p>
<p>13 April 2017<br>Bishop and Bennett announce $50,000 for sanitary products through KidsCan</p>
<p>“It was pleasure to join Deputy PM and Minister for Women Paula Bennett at Taita College today to announce that the Government is providing $50,000 over the next year to assist KidsCan to supply schools with sanitary products.</p>
<p>“We had a very productive round-table conversation with young Taita College women leaders about the way this funding will break down some of challenges students their age face in attending school. It’s a great example of how we’re helping to provide support for those in need.</p>
<p>“This has definitely been an issue raised by young people with me in the last couple of years. It’s great to be able do something about it.</p>
<p>“KidsCan will be able to use this funding to provide sanitary products to more than 16,500 packs to around 2,000 girls. This means these girls won’t have to worry about being able to afford sanitary items, and will remove one of the barriers to their education.</p>
<p>KidsCan Charitable Trust is funded by donations, business sponsorship, government support, philanthropic trusts and gaming revenue. Almost half of its revenue is made up of in-kind gifts and donated goods.</p>
