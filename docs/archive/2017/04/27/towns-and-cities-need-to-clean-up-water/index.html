<p><strong>Denis O’Rourke MP</strong><br>New Zealand First<br>Environment Spokesperson<br>27 APRIL 2017</p>
<p><strong>TOWNS AND CITIES NEED TO CLEAN UP WATER</strong></p>
<p>More work must go into cleaning up town and city waterways and preventing further pollution, says New Zealand First Environment Spokesperson, Denis O’Rourke.</p>
<p>“There’s been a huge focus on runoff from dairying but today’s <em>Our fresh water 2017</em> report from the Ministry for the Environment shows that town waterways are much worse than rural waterways - in fact 22 times worse than natural waterways while the rural water is nine times worse.</p>
<p>“This is disturbing and needs urgent attention. The report says 87 per cent of New Zealanders live in urban areas, and the population grew 17 per cent from 1996 to 2013.</p>
<p>“It says towns and city activities led to higher nutrient concentrations, erosion of the banks, and reduced biodiversity in water ways.</p>
<p>“There is no point focusing solely on rural New Zealand where much is being done and ignoring city water pollution.</p>
<p>“More farmers are turning to water schemes and are turning off their ground water bores. This will recharge Canterbury acquirers and less nitrogen and phosphate leaching, although it will take up to 30 years to &#39;flush&#39; the system.</p>
<p>“Both local government and the National government must educate and put best practices in place to clean up waterways in populated areas to ensure future generations benefit from clean water,” says Mr O’Rourke</p>
