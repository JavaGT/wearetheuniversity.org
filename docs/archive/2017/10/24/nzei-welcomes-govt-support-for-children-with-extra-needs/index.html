<p>NZEI welcomes Government support for children with extra learning needs</p>
<p>24 October 2017</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa welcomes the education policies outlined today in the agreements between Labour and New Zealand First and the Greens.</p>
<p>NZEI President Lynda Stuart said parents and educators would be especially pleased that the Labour-Green confidence and supply deal included ensuring that children with special needs and learning disabilities can fully participate in school.</p>
<p>“Too many children are missing out on the support they need because the current funding for specialists, teacher aides, professional support and other learning resources is so inadequate.</p>
<p>“To enable full participation in school, we’ll need to see a huge boost to special needs funding. That will make a world of difference for our students,” she said.</p>
<p>The education aspects of the Labour and NZ First coalition deal are also welcome, she said. They are: Restore funding for gifted students and Computers in Homes, pilot counsellors in primary schools, free driver training for all secondary school students and restarting Te Kotahitanga teacher professional development.</p>
<p>Ms Stuart said the improvement in family incomes from the increase in the minimum wage up to $20 BY 2020 would have a positive benefit for children and their learning, as well as helping low-paid education workers such as teacher aides.</p>
<p>Ms Stuart said the three parties agreed on a number of key education policies beyond today&#39;s deals that educators wanted to see speedy progress on.</p>
<p>“We’re looking forward to the immediate scrapping of National Standards and charter schools, and the restoration of funding for 100% qualified teachers in ECE,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour, the Greens and New Zealand First have all promised to restore funding for schools and early childhood education.</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest challenges that schools and ECE services are facing are underfunding and a teacher supply crisis. A funding jolt for schools and ECE services, pay equity for school support staff and a significant pay rise for teachers are needed to rebuild New Zealand&#39;s public education system into a world class one.</p>
<p>&quot;The incoming minister and coalition government have the opportunity to make children a priority once again. Our children deserve the best education in the world, and New Zealand can afford to provide it.&quot;</p>
