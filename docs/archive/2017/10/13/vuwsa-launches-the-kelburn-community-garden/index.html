<p>VUWSA Launches the Kelburn Community Garden</p>
<p>In the middle of a busy, inner-city campus, a new garden has appeared.<br>The Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) has today<br>opened the much awaited Kelburn Student Community Garden.</p>
<p>This week’s Mental Health Awareness Week theme is Nature is Key – something quite fitting for the occasion, Welfare Vice President Anya Maule says.</p>
<p>“Tertiary students do struggle with the stress, both because university expectations and financial pressures. We want this garden to be a place where they can come and sit, or plant, but mostly just have some respite from those everyday pressures.”</p>
<p>There are plans to continue growing the garden and tending to the space, with talks already happening about hanging gardens and murals along the walls, Maule says.</p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington staff and students attended the launch on Friday, breaking soil and planting the first lot of vegetables and herbs.</p>
<p>A team from Bunnings was also there to help the beginner gardeners how to plant.<br>Maule says VUWSA wanted the garden to place created by students for students and enlisted students from STUDiO – the Architecture and Design School students’ group – to design the space.</p>
<p>“The hope is that students make this space their own, and enjoy the benefits of being in and around nature, even if it’s only for 15 minutes in between classes.”</p>
