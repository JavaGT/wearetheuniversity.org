<p><strong>Women dominate Māori Journalism Awards</strong></p>
<p>Massey University has announced the finalists in this year’s Māori Journalist of the Year Awards and the list is dominated by women.</p>
<p>The journalism awards were first run last year in conjunction with the University’s long established Ngā Kupu Ora Māori Book Awards.</p>
<p>Massey Assistant Vice-Chancellor Māori and Pasifika, Dr Charlotte Severne is delighted with the success of the awards. “We wanted to celebrate and encourage excellence in Māori Journalism by highlighting its importance not only to te ao Māori (our Māori world) but to Aotearoa. This year’s finalists have expressed Māori perspectives often missing in mainstream media. They have demonstrated overwhelmingly how Māori journalists draw on their culture and language to win the hearts and minds of New Zealanders, thus enriching national dialogue.”</p>
<p>Dr Severne says it is enormously rewarding to see the number of entries almost double this year. “We have also witnessed the rising influence of Māori journalism across different modes of communication with increased entries from print and online media alongside the dominance of Māori broadcasting. I am particularly grateful to our judges Erana Reedy, Moari Stafford and Chris Wikaira who spent many, many hours watching, reading and listening to all the entries.”</p>
<p>The awards recognise stories published or broadcast during 2016 and in a new development journalists could enter in two categories, Te Reo Māori and/or English. The category winners and Māori Journalist of the Year will be announced at the Ngā Kupu Ora Awards: Celebrating Māori Books and Journalism to be held at Te Papa in Wellington on Wednesday November 8. The Te Tohu a Tanara Whairiri Kitawhiti Ngata, Lifetime Achievement Award will also be announced at the dinner.</p>
