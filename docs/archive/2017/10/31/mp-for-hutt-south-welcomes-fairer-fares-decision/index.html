<p>MP for Hutt South</p>
<p>Media statement</p>
<p>31 October 2017</p>
<p><strong>MP for Hutt South Welcomes Fairer Fares Decision</strong></p>
<p>Today the Greater Wellington Regional Council voted in favour of introducing a tertiary students’ discount on public transport across the Wellington region, to take effect from the middle of 2018.</p>
<p>“This is great news for young people in the Hutt and across Wellington” Mr Bishop said.</p>
<p>“I’ve been supporting the Fairer Fares campaign because young people in the Hutt told me the cost of transport to and from campuses was a real barrier to their success”</p>
<p>“For some students, the cost of transport could be over $20 a day if they lived in parts of the Hutt Valley or Wainuiomata and travelled to one of the Victoria, Massey or WelTec campuses in central Wellington. That represents a huge chunk of a student’s weekly living costs, allowance or wages from part time work”</p>
<p>“Wellington was one of the only places in the country not to offer a tertiary students discount, so it is about time our region got on board.”</p>
<p>“The decision today is the result of a sustained campaign by local students’ associations including VUWSA and MAWSA. They have worked for many years alongside elected regional councillors to deliver this for local students.”</p>
<p>“I am proud to have lent my support to this cause over the time I’ve been an MP based in the Hutt Valley.”</p>
<p>“I want to say congratulations to everyone involved in this campaign, and thanks to each of councillors who voted in favour at today’s meeting.”</p>
