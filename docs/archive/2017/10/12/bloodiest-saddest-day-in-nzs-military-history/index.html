<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters</p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader<br>12 OCTOBER 2017  </p>
<p>Bloodiest, Saddest Day in NZ’s Military History</p>
<p>New Zealand First is calling for a report into how best New Zealand can commemorate the bloodiest and saddest day in the country’s military history, says New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“In just a few hours 843 men were killed at the battle of Passchendaele on October 12, 1917 and many of the 1860 wounded that day were grievously injured and did not recover.</p>
<p>“NZ History says Passchendaele has become a byword for the horrors of the Great War with the failed attack on Bellevue Spur on October 12 probably the greatest disaster in New Zealand’s history.</p>
<p>“For a small country of only one million people at the time the impact of this one day of war was immense.</p>
<p>“Anzac Day commemorates all wars and conflicts in which New Zealanders served with a special emphasis on the Gallipoli campaign.</p>
<p>“About seven thousand New Zealanders were killed or wounded at Gallipoli over a period of eight months. Future generations of New Zealanders should be aware of what happened at Passchendaele in a few hours on October 12, 1917,” says Mr Peters.</p>
