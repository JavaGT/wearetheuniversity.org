<p>UC students’ wellbeing Amble more than All Right</p>
<p>Part treasure hunt, part orienteering mission, the upcoming All Right? Amble is a fun, family-friendly walk with a difference, created by University of Canterbury (UC) students to improve wellbeing.</p>
<p>Part of the Breeze Walking Festival, the health-focused family event has been organised by 23 Bachelor of Health Sciences (BHSc) health education students, led by UC Health Education lecturer Tracy Clelland of the College of Education, Health and Human Development.</p>
<p>Starting at 10am on Sunday, 8 October, participants of all ages are encouraged to pick up a map from the Botanic Garden Visitors Centre (before 1.30pm) to help them scout out hidden delights. After ambling over about two kilometres and collecting a stamp at each point they discover, families can return their maps for a prize.</p>
<p>A member of the All Right? Amble management team, UC student Kaitlin Feast, says there are lots of new, exciting activities and games for everyone to experience.</p>

<p>“The aim of the Amble this year is for people to try a variety of activities and strategies that they will be able to apply to their daily lives to improve their overall wellbeing,” she says.</p>
<p>“The message we are promoting is that mental health is a resource for everyday life and has a major impact on everyone in society.”</p>
<p>All Right? Amble, 10am – 2pm, Sunday 8 October, start from Christchurch Botanic Gardens Visitor Centre, Hagley Park.</p>
