<p>Xero boss Rod Drury named Global Marketer of the Year</p>
<p>Rod Drury, founder and CEO of Xero, has been named the Global Marketer of the Year at an international marketing research conference held at the University of Canterbury this week.</p>
<p>The Academy of Marketing Science (AMS) 2017 Global Marketer of the Year Award was presented to Drury at the 2017 AMS World Marketing Congress, hosted by the University of Canterbury (UC) Business School | Te Kura Umanga. Running from June 27 to July 1, this is the first time UC has hosted the international event.</p>
<p>The Academy of Marketing Science Co-director of International Programs, Professor Barry J. Babin, says that Drury epitomises the Global Marketer of the Year Award.</p>
<p>“The entrepreneurial spirit and drive he shows and his willingness to explore the cutting edges of marketing truly capture the spirit of the AMS mission. We welcome Rod to the AMS family.”</p>
<p>New Zealand technology entrepreneur Drury heads Xero, a leading international cloud accounting solution for small business.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to be grouped alongside previous global winners of this award like Coca-Cola, and to have Xero recognised for the marketing discipline our team has developed over the past 10 years,” he says.</p>
<p>“As you look at the next 10 years, marketing science gets even more interesting as the disciplines of marketing and data sciences interact to create entirely new approaches to build global brands.”</p>
<p>UC marketing experts presenting at the conference include Dr Ann-Marie Kennedy, Associate Professor Joerg Finsterwalder, Associate Professor Girish Prayag, Dr Chris Chen, and Professor C. Michael Hall and Marketing PhD student Joya Kemper.</p>
