<p><strong>New Zealand National Party</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Bill English</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Prime Minister &amp;</strong><br><strong>National Party Leader</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Speech to National’s Annual Conference</strong><br>Thank you for that generous welcome.<br>I quite liked that video. I was particularly pleased they left out the spaghetti and pineapple pizza.<br>Delegates, Cabinet colleagues, MPs, fellow National Party members.<br>Isn’t New Zealand a great place to live?<br>We’ve got a strong economy. More New Zealanders are staying home to build their lives here. And we’re confident about our place in the world.<br>Few countries have such a positive outlook.<br>All of you in the National Party have contributed to that success.<br>You’ve worked hard in the interests of New Zealand through the good times and the bad.<br>And on the threshold of election year, you’ve seamlessly installed a new leadership team.<br>Thank you.<br>Thank you for your support. Thank you for your confidence. And thank you for the honour.<br>I want to thank someone who keeps it real and has a talent for connecting with New Zealanders – my deputy Paula Bennett.<br>Before the last election, I was campaigning in Hamilton and a woman stopped me in a shopping mall.<br>This woman told me that, like Paula, her daughter had been a teenage solo mother and had lost her way a bit.<br>Somehow, the daughter ended up going along to one of Paula’s speeches.<br>That young woman was so inspired that she left that speech and enrolled at teachers’ college and is now doing really well.<br>Paula – that’s what I call making a difference.<br>After the Budget last month, one commentator said some Budgets focus on infrastructure, some on public services and some on raising incomes.<br>I want to thank the first Finance Minister to pull off all three at once – my friend and colleague, the talented Steven Joyce.<br>Steven sure is better than the last finance guy.<br>And his discipline and focus on issues that matter are at the core of National’s success.<br>But he is following the previous Finance Minister’s advice – don’t take too much notice of the Prime Minister.<br>I’m proud of our other senior ministers Gerry Brownlee, Simon Bridges, Amy Adams and Jonathan Coleman.<br>Together we lead a united Cabinet, and a Caucus that’s connected to our communities and focused on what matters.<br>We lead a Government that delivers for all New Zealanders.<br>But we’re only Members of Parliament because of you, the National Party.<br>I want to thank our fantastic President Peter Goodfellow.<br>My thanks to our Board, electorate chairs, all our volunteers and the professional team at National Party HQ.<br>You are the backbone of our party.<br>Your efforts will be crucial in the upcoming election campaign.<br>It will be tough. It will be tight. But we are united, we are energised and we are ready.<br>I also want to thank someone who at times might have felt she was a solo mother raising six children – the love of my life, Mary.<br>Mary, and Luke, Tom, Maria, Rory, Bart and Xavier, thanks for all your advice and support.<br>Your sacrifice is our privilege.<br>Delegates, at the end of last year, we farewelled a man who gave so much to this party.<br>He was a great Prime Minister and a fantastic leader. We are a more confident country because of him – the incomparable Sir John Key.<br>Back in December we wished John well and then got straight back on with the job.<br>Because we understand that being in Government is not about us. It’s about what we do for people – making a difference to their lives.<br>Because National is a party that cares about people and gets things done.<br>We are upfront about the challenges, and we are practical about the solutions.<br>And we listen, because others care too and have insights we can learn from.<br>This party’s principles are our anchor.<br>A belief in the empowering nature of free enterprise, individual freedom and personal responsibility.<br>Principles that are the foundation of success for New Zealand.<br>But none of them is more important than the Kiwi belief in a fair go and our willingness to give a hand up to those less fortunate.<br>They are equally deserving of an opportunity to contribute to society and to set off down their own path to independence.<br>I strongly believe that if we can build on our current success, we can offer everyone better opportunities.<br>On Thursday I met 25 recovering drug addicts, and I admired their quiet courage to change their lives.<br>That day I also spoke at the World Class New Zealand Awards, where I met Kiwis whose brilliance is changing lives around the world.<br>And this week we will beat the Lions again, win back the America’s Cup and Lorde’s new album will be number one in the charts.<br>Delegates, that’s why I’m optimistic about New Zealand’s future and why I back all New Zealanders to succeed.<br>Their hard work over many years, backed by National’s strong economic plan, has created one of the fastest growing economies in the developed world.<br>We’re creating 10,000 jobs a month.<br>The books are in surplus and debt is falling.<br>Exports are growing.<br>And remember those long debates about why so many Kiwis were leaving?<br>Well, now they’re staying.<br>Five years ago a net 40,000 people were leaving for Australia every year.<br>This year, a net 800 came home.<br>So 150,000 more Kiwis now live and work here, instead of on the other side of the Tasman.<br>That really is success.<br>Some don’t see it that way. They see it as too many people, too many houses, too many problems.<br>But if that pressure is driven by a generation of New Zealanders staying home because they see better opportunities here, then I embrace it.<br>It’s a choice.<br>We either decide we’re up for it, or we’re not.<br>The opposition have certainly made their view of New Zealand clear.<br>And after nine long years, their policies are just like them – worse than when they started.<br>They think more projects like the Waterview Tunnel are too much for us, that trade is to be feared and housing developments opposed.<br>They’re too negative to welcome opportunity.<br>The Labour leader says it’s time for a breather.<br>He hasn’t done anything, and he’s already out of breath.<br>Their bleak and lazy view of our country smacks of a lack of confidence in New Zealanders – that somehow it’s all too hard to be successful.<br>Well, National is up for it. And New Zealanders are too.<br>National will take the path of growth and openness – and govern with the ambition New Zealanders have earned.<br>Because that’s the attitude that has delivered a strong economy and strong government finances.<br>It’s delivered more jobs, more apprenticeships and more police.<br>Better roads, better classrooms and better broadband.<br>Higher wages, higher school pass rates and higher benefits for struggling families.<br>Less crime, less tax and less unemployment.<br>Fewer regulations, fewer rheumatic fever cases, and one I’m particularly proud of, 60,000 fewer kids in benefit-dependent households.<br>That’s what National’s delivering for New Zealanders.<br>And families get some of the biggest benefits.<br>Let me tell you how.<br>Last year, I met a group of young mums in West Auckland.<br>I listened to their stories of grappling with the pressures of family and finances, paying for housing and putting aside for the future.<br>National is improving their lives.<br>They’ll find it easier to get their children into early childhood education, thanks to a significant extra taxpayer investment.<br>It’s cheaper for them to go to the doctor and get prescriptions, with free doctors’ visits for under 13s.<br>Their older children are now more likely to get NCEA.<br>In April last year, those families on a benefit received an extra $25 a week – the first increase in over 40 years.<br>They may have moved into work, given well over 200,000 jobs have been created in the last three years.<br>And if one of those women is a care and support worker, she will get a significant pay boost from next week – $200 more a fortnight for a full-time worker on the minimum wage.<br>That’s on top of normal pay increases.<br>Since we came into office, the average wage has increased by around $12,000 – twice the rate of inflation.<br>These are the opportunities that come from growth and National embraces them.<br>But we know we must keep investing to support that growth.<br>And we know we can – because we’re doing it already.<br>By building the Waterview Tunnel to help complete the Auckland motorway network.<br>By investing in other significant roads, so four lanes will stretch from Cambridge to Whangarei and from Levin to Wellington.<br>By rolling out ultra-fast broadband so that by 2020 we will be one of the world’s most connected countries.<br>All at the same time as rebuilding Christchurch and Kaikoura.<br>We can all be proud of what we’ve achieved, but it’s not enough.<br>It’s not enough for people whose businesses are just taking off, or whose lives are just turning around.<br>It’s not enough for first home buyers waiting for more houses to be built.<br>It’s not enough for people who haven’t yet seen the benefits of growth.<br>We need to do more.<br>Already this year we’ve announced significant steps in our plan to ensure all New Zealanders share the benefits of growth.<br>Next month we’ll see the first group of the extra 1125 police staff arrive at the Porirua Police College.<br>From April, the Family Incomes Package – which Labour opposed – will boost the incomes of 1.3 million New Zealand families by an average of $26 a week.<br>For one of those West Auckland families I mentioned earlier, if they are earning $48,000 a year with two children, their income will rise by $35 per week from 1 April.<br>And depending on their housing costs, they could be eligible for an additional $100 per week in Accommodation Supplement.<br>By June next year, we’ll have delivered nearly 3000 of the 34,000 houses we will build in Auckland over the next 10 years – adding to the 10,000 a year already being built<br>And we’re working at making New Zealand predator free.<br>You see, these are the positive choices that a growing economy and growing surpluses give us.<br>And we’re just getting started.<br>So many New Zealanders have potential yet to be realised and aspirations yet to be fulfilled.<br>We will keep working hard for them.<br>Today, I’m setting out my vision to take New Zealand into the 2020s.<br>We’ll work for a New Zealand where innovation and hard work is recognised and rewarded.<br>We’ll work for a New Zealand that embraces trade and growth, and the opportunities they bring.<br>We’ll work for a New Zealand that looks after the most vulnerable, and helps them change their lives.<br>And we will work with any New Zealanders who share our sense of purpose.<br>That’s National’s New Zealand. And that’s my New Zealand.<br>We’re doing so well as a country, but we must grasp this rare opportunity to do so much more.<br>So here’s what we plan to do next if we have the privilege of leading New Zealand for the next three years.<br>We will deliver the economy, the environment, the infrastructure, the incomes and the public services to take New Zealand into the 2020s.<br>Before anything else, National will keep the economy front and centre of everything we do.<br>Because we know we have to keep the economy growing before everyone can share in the benefits.<br>Our economy is becoming more dynamic and diversified.<br>Traditional strengths, such as meat and dairy, continue to grow.<br>And we’re seeing fantastic developments in new service industries like ICT, tourism, education and high-tech manufacturing.<br>National will continue to support that growth.<br>Another priority will be protecting the environment for future generations, and growing the value of New Zealand’s clean green brand – our strategic advantage in a competitive world.<br>With a strong economy we can have high environmental standards.<br>So we’ll work with local government and farmers to invest extensively to improve the quality of our rivers and lakes.<br>We’ll work to resolve the challenging infrastructure requirements for urban water.<br>And we will ensure that the quality of every significant waterway across our country is regularly measured, to make sure they improve.<br>Next, we’ll build the roads, schools, hospitals, housing, rail and broadband to support growth through our ambitious $32 billion infrastructure programme – the biggest in New Zealand’s history.<br>I tell you, it’s a good time to have shares in an orange cone company!<br>The next stage is to allocate the $1 billion Housing Infrastructure Fund, which will help to build tens of thousands of new homes sooner and faster.<br>We will have more to stay about that in the next few weeks.<br>We’ll partner with local government and the private sector, and use all available financing and funding mechanisms to get more things done, rather than get hung up on who does it.<br>And we’ll continue to seek more worthy projects to add to that programme.<br>Another priority will be further raising take-home incomes and reducing taxes.<br>National wants to do more to put more money in people’s pockets and reduce the pressure on those families most in need.<br>We believe that taxpayers make better use of their own money than politicians.<br>A strong economy on its own lifts incomes.<br>But of course the Government can also help. The Budget’s Family Incomes Package was an excellent step forward.<br>Wouldn’t it be great if we could do it again?<br>Well, we can.<br>If we are able to keep lifting growth and carefully manage the public finances, we will be able to further reduce taxes and lift incomes.<br>Finally, National will push government agencies to provide even better public services for their customers – all New Zealanders.<br>We will keep investing in core services like health and education – with an increasing focus on tailoring services to the individual needs of your family.<br>I’ll give you some examples.<br>Some of our children aren’t doing as well in maths as they should be.<br>That’s a stumbling block towards further study and careers in science and technology.<br>So we’ll focus on ensuring our young people have the maths and digital skills to set them up for the 2030s, not the 1980s.<br>And in health, too many of our young children end up in hospital for avoidable illnesses like asthma, pneumonia, eczema and dental conditions.<br>So we’ll work hard to resolve this and ensure all our kids have a healthy start to life.<br>Changing how government works is difficult and takes time, but it’s worth it for the lives we can change.<br>We’ll continue to focus on keeping our communities safe.<br>As well as the extra police staff I announced earlier this year, we want to roll out programmes to target gangs, organised crime and drugs, to reduce the harm they cause.<br>In other areas we’ll aim to have fewer people who rely on government services.<br>By rolling out the tools of social investment for all government social services, we will massively improve the lives of our most vulnerable citizens.<br>Our opponents think caring is promising more money.<br>But the need for more spending is often a sign of failure, not success.<br>I call it servicing misery.<br>Our aim is simple – to change lives.<br>Changing lives means delivering less crime, less welfare dependence, less drug abuse, less self-harm, less family violence, and fewer people unable to fend for themselves.<br>Changing lives means caring enough to dig into the nitty gritty and help someone become more independent.<br>And I can tell you, this is a government that really cares.<br>Ladies and gentlemen.<br>Over the next three months, we will campaign hard to earn the privilege of leading this great country for another term.<br>The choice is stark.<br>You can choose a New Zealand which is open to trade, open to investment, happy to have Kiwis stay home and embraces the challenges of growth.<br>Or you can choose an unruly alliance of Labour, the Greens and New Zealand First.<br>A miserable group that finds growth frightening, that wants to shut down investment, shut down trade, shut down growth and shut down opportunity.<br>They would rather New Zealand slowed down to their pace.<br>Well, we’re going with ambition, success and opportunity.<br>Only one party will go in to this election proud of getting the Government&#39;s books back in black – National.<br>Only one party knows what it takes to create new jobs and opportunities – National.<br>Only one party will listen and work with communities and families to change lives and reduce dependency – National.<br>And only one party wants to lead a successful, proud and confident country into the 2020s – it&#39;s National.<br>National is the party that will drive New Zealand’s prosperity.<br>So let’s get out there and tell New Zealanders – on September the 23rd, give your party vote to National.<br>Thank you.  </p>
