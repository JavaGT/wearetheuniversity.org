<p>57 students win PM’s scholarships to Asia</p>
<p>Dozens of University of Canterbury students will gain first-hand experience studying in China, Thailand and Singapore after five UC programmes have been successful in the latest Prime Minister’s Scholarship for Asia (PMSA) funding round.</p>
<p>In total 57 UC students will benefit from the PMSA awards through UC programmes or internships, including three individual awards.</p>
<p>University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr welcomed the announcement of the scholarships, which will provide more than $280,000 in total funding for UC students to travel to Asia.</p>
<p>“This is another demonstration of how the University of Canterbury is at the forefront of producing the next generation of professionals who will lead in establishing and strengthening key educational, economic, social and cultural relationships with leaders in Asia,” Dr Carr says.</p>
<p>“It’s all part of UC’s commitment to enhance global awareness by providing international experiences to our students linked to the global graduate attribute, which is part of preparing UC students to make a difference.”</p>
<p>UC Arts and Business student Mathew Birt, who travelled to China as part of the Peking University Summer Programme last December, has been awarded an individual scholarship that will enable him to study Chinese and Accounting at Zhejiang Gongshang University.</p>
<p>“I&#39;m looking forward to immersing myself in Chinese culture again. My Peking trip just made me hungry for more,” he says.</p>
