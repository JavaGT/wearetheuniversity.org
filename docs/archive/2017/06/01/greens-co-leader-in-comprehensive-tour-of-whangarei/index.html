<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong><br><strong>For Immediate Release</strong><br><strong>01 June 2017</strong></p>
<p><strong>Greens Co-leader in comprehensive tour of Whangarei.</strong></p>
<p>The Co-leader of the Green Party, James Shaw, will be visiting Whangarei on 7 and 8 June. While here, his programme will include:</p>
<p><strong>Business Talks</strong></p>
<p>James Shaw, alongside local leaders Sharon Morgan, Kris Macdonald (Ngãtiwai Trust Board), Ana Heremaia, and Ruby Watson, will participate in a bold new discussion series called ‘The Talks.’ Utilising the upcoming election as a platform for creating powerful community discussion, Ash Holwell is facilitating a series of events with with industry leaders, innovative thinkers, and successful creators.</p>
<p><em>“We learnt last year during the local body election campaign that most of the public events failed to include the audience, or provide a platform for the hard discussions that will really address the issues facing Whangarei. The Talks will be different. They will be relevant to the future of Whangarei, include a diversity of exciting participants, and offer audience real participation.” says Ash Holwell.</em></p>
<p><strong>Business Breakfast</strong></p>
<p>In this election year the Northland Chamber of Commerce presents a breakfast event bringing together political and business leaders, for a powerful learning and networking morning, hosted by the Northland Chamber of Commerce and Deluca.</p>
<p>The event will be a chance to have conversations with a range of people critical to the future of our local economy, including Sheryl Mai (WDC), Sharon Morgan (NRU &amp; WDC), Karma Butler (Asia-Pacific Superyachts), Lisa Halverson (Workspace, Work Ready NZ), Angeline Waetford (Ngãtiwai Trust Board), Ruth Green-Cole (WAM), Tony Savage (WRMK, Labour Party Candidate), Freya Johnstone (Johnstone Group), Tony Collins (Chamber of Commerce), James Shaw (Co-leader of the Green Party), Ash Holwell (Green Party Candidate).</p>
<p><strong>Te Uku Development’s Papakainga</strong></p>
<p>James Shaw and Ash Holwell will visit Uku Developer’s innovative papakainga development in Whangarei. Situated in Mangakahia, and led by the developers experienced in idea-to-completion sustainable and indigenous housing projects.</p>
<p><em>“Uku’s work is one of many papakainga projects currently underway in Aotearoa. All of them provide housing options that are far more viable, and engage much longer term thinking than much of our previous approaches to housing. These projects are our leading lights in terms of housing and education of NEETS - two of the issues our current government have failed to address adequately.” says Ash Holwell.</em></p>
<p>The project is training young people in future-focused building techniques that use local resources and technologies. The project is supported through Te Puni Kōkiri under its Māori Housing strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Food For Life</strong></p>
<p>James and Ash will have lunch at Manaia View School, serving the kids of the school food created by Food For Life. A powerful project that has improved the lives of hundreds of low-decile students throughout the past five years by providing low-decile g healthy lunches - at times to the level of over 1,000 per week.</p>
<p>Recently Green MPs Catherine Delahunty and Marama Davidson have been in discussions with Food For Life around the organisation’s research into the possibilities of feeding every struggling student in Northland.</p>
<p><em>“When you look at the numbers, and consider the long term benefits of healthy children, educated young adults, and the fulfilling lives they might be helped to lead through something as simple as a healthy lunch, it’s a bargain. As a region, we’d all gain so much from it.” says Ash Holwell.</em></p>
<p><strong>Camera Obscura</strong></p>
<p>Before leaving, Diane Stoppard will tour James through the Camera Obscura Timatatanga Hou project, currently housed in the former NRC building on Whangarei’s waterfront.</p>
<p><em>“The project is an inspiration - a locally designed, world standard feature which combines photography, sculpture, architecture, education, and has galvanised hundreds in the community, including the likes of Culham Engineering, Firth, Cook Costello, Rudolphs, United Civil, Formable, Steve Bowling, and so many more. This is an example of people coming together around something they believe in, and working together to use what they have to make it happen - it’s a great model for government to learn from.” says Ash Holwell</em></p>
