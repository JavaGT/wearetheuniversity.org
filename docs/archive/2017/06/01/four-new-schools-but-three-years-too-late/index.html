<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>1 June 2017</p>
<p>Four new schools but three years too late</p>
<p>The Government’s announcement of four new schools in Auckland is three years too late, says Labour’s education spokesperson Chris Hipkins.</p>
<p>“Two years ago the Education Minister said the National Government’s 2014 election announcement to spend $350m on Auckland schools getting ahead of demand ‘provides for nine new Auckland schools by 2018.’</p>
<p>“Three years on and we’re still suffering from overcrowded classes and a lack of vision from the National Government.</p>
<p>“Nikki Kaye seems to think that simply announcing building locations is something to be proud of. It’s not. It’s an embarrassing admission of failure.</p>
<p>“Where are the nine new Auckland schools she promised for next year? Why has the Government failed to spend the $350m they promised three years ago – to get ahead of demand?</p>
<p>“The $240m announced today is not new money for a new idea. Its old school National trickery announcing funding they first announced in 2014 but failed to spend.</p>
<p>“Auckland schools are already struggling. A report last week showed 40 Auckland schools are over capacity and 130 are at risk of overcrowding.</p>
<p>“National is failing to deliver on their promises and they cannot be trusted for another three years. It’s time for a fresh approach.</p>
<p>“Labour will implement a comprehensive plan for school property to ease pressure on our schools, making sure every child has sufficient time with their teacher to reach their full potential,” says Chris Hipkins.</p>
