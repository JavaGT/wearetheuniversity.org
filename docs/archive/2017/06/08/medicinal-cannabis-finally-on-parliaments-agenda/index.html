<p><strong>Medicinal cannabis finally on Parliament’s agenda</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party is thrilled that Parliament will consider whether to finally legalise medicinal cannabis in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Green Party health spokesperson Julie Anne Genter’s <a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/policy/fairer-society/cannabis">Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis and Other Matters) Amendment Bill</a> was drawn from the Member’s Ballot today. The Bill will make it legal for any New Zealander who is suffering from a terminal illness or any debilitating condition to use cannabis or cannabis products with the support of a registered medical practitioner.</p>
<p>“We are finally going to have the conversation about medicinal cannabis that New Zealanders have been crying out for,” said Green Party health spokesperson.</p>
<p>“No Kiwi should have to live in pain because of an archaic, uncompassionate law.</p>
<p>“Medicinal cannabis must be available by prescription at the doctor but it also must be affordable.</p>
<p>“The recent ‘softening’ of the law, announced by Peter Dunne, goes only part of the way to ensuring New Zealanders can get the pain relief they need. It does not guarantee medicinal cannabis products will be affordable for the average New Zealander – in fact, it relies upon the import of expensive overseas-developed medicines.</p>
<p>“Why should New Zealanders have to pay thousands of dollars to buy imported medicinal cannabis products when we can produce our own effective and affordable medicines here?</p>

<p>“My Bill will ensure that sick people and those in pain will actually be able to afford the cannabis products they need.</p>
<p>“The change to cannabis laws that New Zealanders have been wanting for years is now within reach. The hard work of everyone who has campaigned on this issue, including Rose Renton and the late Helen Kelly, may finally be realised.</p>
<p>“New Zealand can finally catch up to the much of the rest of the world on cannabis – now it’s up to my colleagues across the aisle in Parliament,” said Ms Genter.</p>
