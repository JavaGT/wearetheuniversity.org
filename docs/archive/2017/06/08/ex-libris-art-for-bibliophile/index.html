<p><strong>Ex Libris – art for bibliophiles features in University of Canterbury exhibition</strong></p>
<p>A bibliophile art-lover’s dream, an exhibition of artful bookplates and provenance is currently on display in the University of Canterbury’s Matariki gallery.</p>
<p>Ex Libris (meaning ‘from the books’) showcases some visually stunning samples found among the collections of UC’s extensive Macmillan Brown Library collection.</p>
<p>The exhibition includes an array of book-related material of exquisite artistry, ranging from a 1531 edition of the Magna Carta to a 1923 association copy of <em>New Hampshire</em> by American poet Robert Frost, all of which have a connection with Canterbury institutions and personalities.</p>
<p>Inscriptions, labels, stamps, association books, marginalia, bookplates and personal items bring to life the journey of a book, UC Special Collections Librarian and curator Damian Cairns explains.</p>
<p>“These possessive marks can show the love of as well as the possession of books, the owner’s social position and personality, insight into the socio-political landscape of a period and artistic movements such as Canterbury’s ‘The Group’,” he says.</p>
<p>“The graphic quality of this possessive mark making enriches books beyond their original intent. They open a point of connection to a person or period and provide us with an understanding of the social-life of the object.”</p>
<p>Have you ever wanted your very own bookplate? A bookplate design competition open to UC students and staff coincides with the exhibition. Visit the exhibition or any UC campus library for entry details.</p>
<p><strong>Ex Libris</strong> exhibition runs until 5 July 2017 in the Matariki Gallery opposite Puaka-James Hight building, University of Canterbury. Ilam campus.</p>
