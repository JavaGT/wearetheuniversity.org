<p>Labour’s Electoral Amendment Bill to enhance democracy</p>
<p>Democracy will be enhanced under Labour’s Private Member’s Bill which will have its First Reading today, says Labour’s Local Government spokesperson MP Meka Whaitiri.</p>
<p>“Under my Bill, the Electoral (Registration by Special Vote) Amendment Bill, unregistered voters will be able to register by completing a special vote.</p>
<p>“There were 331,005 special votes cast in 2014. Of the special votes cast last election, 27,467 were disallowed because the voter was not enrolled at all.</p>
<p>“My Bill will enhance democracy in New Zealand by ensuring those whose voice would otherwise not be heard are engaged in the political process and have their votes counted.</p>
<p>“This amendment to the Electoral Act would enact recommendations made by the Electoral Commission and enable tens of thousands more Kiwis to participate in our democratic process.</p>
<p>“That’s vitally important if voters are to elect a Parliament that is truly representative of our communities.</p>
<p>“For various reasons voters may choose to complete a special vote, which involves submitting their details and signing a statutory declaration in front of a witness, unaware that they are not enrolled to vote.</p>
<p>“I look forward to Government support for this Bill which will enhance democratic participation and streamline the electoral process,” says Meka Whaitiri.</p>
