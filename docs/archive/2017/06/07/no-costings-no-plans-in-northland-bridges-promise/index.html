<p><strong>Wednesday, 7 June 2017, 8:05 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>No Costings, No Plans in Northland Bridges Promise</strong></p>
<p>More evidence has emerged that National dreamt up its two-lane bridges promise on the spur of the moment during the 2015 Northland by-election, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“The original promise was that the 10 new bridges would cost between $32m and $69m. However, NZTA now says just four of those bridges will cost $62m.<br>“That shows National had no plans and no costings for the 10 bridges. They just wanted a sound-bite.</p>
<p>“After neglecting Northland for decades they panicked when they realised the public had had enough, and latched on to the fact Northland had over a thousand single-lane bridges. They would not have known previously because Mr Joyce and Mr Key only discovered Northland in 2015.</p>
<p>“National even decided to build a two-lane bridge between two kauri trees, known as Darby and Joan, where there is no river. Darby and Joan already have an environmental prize winning ramp over the root system.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister claimed in Parliament today there has been progress on the bridges – but in two years since the promise was made there are no new bridges, and building has not even started on one.”</p>
