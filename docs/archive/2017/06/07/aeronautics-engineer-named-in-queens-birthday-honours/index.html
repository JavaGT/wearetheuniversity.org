<p>Leading kiwi aeronautics engineer and educational innovator Karen Willcox, an alumna of the University of Auckland, has been named a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the Queen’s Birthday honours.</p>
<p>Professor Willcox is Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and co-director of the MIT Center for Computational Engineering. She gained her Bachelor of Engineering from the University of Auckland before completing her PhD at MIT.</p>
<p>She says she was surprised and delighted by being named in this year’s honours.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a great honour to be recognised in this way, and while my career has taken me offshore, NZ is, and always will be, home.</p>
<p>“I have been very fortunate in my career opportunities, and I am always grateful for chances to help inspire the next generation of young New Zealanders.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Willcox has served on the faculty at MIT for 16 years. Prior to that, she worked at Boeing Phantom Works with the Blended-Wing-Body aircraft design group.</p>
<p>Her research at MIT has produced methods that enable the design and operation of next-generation aircraft. These methods are widely applied in aircraft system design and environmental policy decision-making. She currently leads an Air Force MURI (Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative) on optimal design of multi-physics systems.</p>
<p>In addition to her research, Professor Willcox is active in education innovation. She is currently co-Chair of the MIT Online Education Policy Initiative and Chair of the MIT OpenCourseWare Faculty Advisory Board.</p>
<p>Her passion for education includes a strong interest in promoting girls’ and young women’s interest in science, mathematics and engineering. She is a current member of the advisory board for Girls’ Angle, a non-profit organisation that aims to foster and nurture girls&#39; interest in mathematics.</p>
<p>On regular visits to New Zealand, she engages in outreach visits to schools, many through the Sir Peter Blake Trust, who named her an Emerging Leader in 2010.</p>
<p>&quot;There are so many opportunities in engineering, designing a better future for our world,&quot; Professor Willcox says. &quot;To make that a reality, we need to draw on the passions, the inspirations and the different viewpoints of young people from all across society.&quot;</p>
