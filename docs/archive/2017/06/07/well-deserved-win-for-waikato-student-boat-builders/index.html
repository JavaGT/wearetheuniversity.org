<p>The banks of Oranga Lake at the University of Waikato were crowded with onlookers last week, as more than 30 student-built model boats battled it out as part of the annual University of Waikato Engineering Design Challenge.</p>
<p>Each year, convenor of the Foundations of Engineering paper <a href="http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/about-us/people/torrens">Dr Rob Torrens</a> organises the project where first-year engineering students design and build model boats and test their designs in a series of elimination races across the campus lake. The fan-propelled boats complete races around a course which test their manoeuvrability and whether they could last the day.</p>
<p><strong>Winning team</strong></p>
<p>Team Djibouti won the final battle, which came as a surprise for first-year mechanical engineering students Alex Dixon, Gareth Hall and Akhil Babu, civil engineering students Chloe Roque, Aliesha McKillop, and Sean Mccarthy, and electronic engineering student William Stevenson.</p>
<p>“This is such a rewarding win for us as we put in a lot of hard work over the semester,” says Aliesha. “There is a lot of pressure on the day, but our boat performed really well. Overall it has been a great experience and a very worthwhile project to be involved in.”</p>

<p>**Successful event<br>**<br>Organiser Dr Rob Torrens was very pleased with how the event went: “We were lucky the weather cleared up and we had some really competitive boats this year.”</p>
<p>The race has been held, in some form or another, for about 15 years and has become a staple event on the calendar of Waikato engineering students.</p>
<p>Fourth-year students and other engineering staff were also involved. The fourth-year students act as syndicate managers as part of their project management paper. It has long been a tradition for staff to build their own boat, which is raced during the event against other student boats.</p>
<p>“I was particularly pleased that the staff boat beat the student boat, albeit under controversial circumstances,” says Dr Torrens.</p>
