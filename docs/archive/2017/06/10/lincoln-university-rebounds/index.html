<p><strong>Lincoln University Rebounds</strong></p>
<p>A financial surplus for the first time in a decade and a comprehensive ongoing programme of organisational change are two of the reasons behind a significant turnaround at Lincoln University.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor, Professor Robin Pollard, said the excellent progress in returning Lincoln University to profitability is the result of a clear strategy, strong leadership and sustained teamwork at every level of the organisation.</p>
<p>“In February 2016, a review jointly commissioned by the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) and Lincoln University was announced, to consider ways to ensure the University’s future. This was extremely useful in focusing minds,” he said.</p>
<p>The report entitled ‘<em>Strategic Options Assessment’</em> was completed by EY (formerly Ernst &amp; Young), and received by Lincoln University’s Council in mid-2016.</p>
<p>The ‘Refreshing Lincoln’ initiative began in August 2016 which addressed a number of the financial, academic and organisational issues raised in the EY report.</p>
<p>“We brought together a new executive leadership team in a short period of time and they have driven changes including implementing a new business model,” says Professor Pollard. “This included establishing an ‘internal economy’ with each operating unit now responsible for its own budgets, reporting, and monitoring of their operations. The Refreshing Lincoln programme has also focussed on reducing costs, reviewing strategic assets which may no longer be needed, and work to improve programme attractiveness and increase student numbers.”</p>

<p>A Transformation Board was appointed, with extensive international expertise. It is focused on a wide range of options to best ensure that Lincoln University makes a sustainable and significant contribution to NZ and international land-based education research. The Board will report to the Lincoln Council in October.</p>
<p>The Vice Chancellor said, “there is still much work to be done but it is significant that at the end of 2016, for the first time in a decade, Lincoln University achieved a financial surplus before unusual items which the EY report predicted would not be achieved for at least another ten years”.</p>
<p>Lincoln University’s Annual Report is available here and printed copies are available on Monday June 12. It provides detail of recent changes.</p>
<p>“The Annual Report shows a clear improvement in our financial operation and confirms that our strategy is sound,” said Professor Pollard. “The positive financial result, new approaches to business and an exciting campus building programme are all contributing to forging a sustainable future for Lincoln – for the students, staff and wider community.</p>
<p>“There is no doubt that a specialist, land-based education and research institution is needed in the South Island, providing opportunities to contribute to New Zealand and the international economy,” he says.</p>
