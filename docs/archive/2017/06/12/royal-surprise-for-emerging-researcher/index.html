<p>The Royal Geographical Society in London has recognised a University of Auckland PhD student as a leading new researcher in the field of geography.</p>
<p>Brendon Blue, a doctoral student in the School of Environment in the Faculty of Science, received his accolade in person at the Society’s Kensington headquarters on Monday.</p>
<p>He received the Wiley Publisher’s Area Prize for New Research in Geography, for the best article in the journal by a new researcher.</p>
<p>“I receive the Area Prize with real surprise and delight. I would like to thank my colleagues in geography at the University of Auckland for encouraging and supporting my diverse and interdisciplinary interests,” Brendon says. He also thanked the journal’s editors.</p>
<p>The Royal Geographical Society’s medals and awards recognise extraordinary achievement in geographical research, fieldwork and teaching, photography and public engagement.</p>
<p>Brendon was among 17 people to receive awards at a celebration which followed the Society’s Annual General Meeting.</p>
<p>Brendon’s paper, titled “But what do you measure? Prospects for a constructive critical physical geography”, explored possibilities for more socially-sensitive river science and management.</p>
<p>The Society said of Brendon’s article: “This is an excellent agenda-setting paper that explores how geomorphic knowledge is manufactured and mobilised. Using the example of river diversity and measurement, it makes the case for a ‘constructive critical physical geography’ that develops rigorous, place-based and democratic understandings of landscapes.”</p>
<p>Founded in 1830, the Royal Geographical Society is dedicated to the development and promotion of geographical knowledge, together with its application to the challenges facing society and the environment.</p>
