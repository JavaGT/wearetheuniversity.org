<p>With only a few weeks left before the General Election, the School of Architecture and Planning at the University of Auckland is hosting a series of events to coincide with its centenary, that highlight the influence of the disciplines on our daily lives.</p>
<p>Next Wednesday, organised by the New Zealand Institute of Architects as part of its annual Festival of Architecture, representatives of the main political parties will take part in a debate at the University called <em>The Homesick Blues</em>. Few issues in Auckland are more crucial than housing. If Auckland’s population doubles in the next 25 years, where – and how – will we live?  </p>
<p>Hear Alfred Ngaro (National), Phil Twyford (Labour), Julie-Ann Genter (Green Party), Carrie Stoddart-Smith (Māori Party), Denis O&#39;Rourke (New Zealand First), Damian Light (United Future) and Geoff Simmons (the Opportunities Party) outline their positions on housing provision, affordability and quality at this event compered by Rod Oram.  </p>
<p>The Festival of Architecture also includes a suite of exhibitions.</p>
<p>On Thursday, as part of the School of Architecture and Planning’s centenary, an exhibition of current student work called <em>Design Studio in Action</em>, combined with the opening of a new and expanded edition of the <em>Architecture + Women New Zealand Timeline</em>, takes place. Both remain open until Wednesday 13 November.  </p>
<p>On Friday evening, the School opens its major centenary exhibition. Held at the Gus Fisher Gallery, the exhibition curated by Michael Milojevic, Lucy Treep, Andrew Barrie and Julia Gatley, presents a hundred years of the School of Architecture and Planning through drawings, photographs and publications. It has a particular focus on student drawings which demonstrate the changes in architectural design during this time.  </p>
<p>The exhibition opening at 5.30pm includes the launch of a new book <em>The Auckland School: 100 Years of Architecture and Planning</em>, written by staff from the faculty.  </p>
<p>The importance of well-educated architects and planners for our community is more relevant than ever as we face the challenge of how to provide liveable towns and cities that properly reflect who we are and what we need to thrive.</p>
<p>As New Zealand’s first institution teaching both architecture and planning, please join us in celebrating our first 100 years. For more information visit <a href="http://archplancentenary.ac.nz/">http://archplancentenary.ac.nz/</a>  </p>
