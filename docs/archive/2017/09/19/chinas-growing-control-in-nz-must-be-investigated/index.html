<p><strong>China’s Growing Control in NZ Must Be Investigated</strong></p>
<p>Communist China’s hold on New Zealand has to be explained, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Last week we called for a full inquiry into how Jian Yang, a member of the Chinese Communist Party with strong ties to their intelligence community, could become a National List MP in our Parliament.</p>
<p>“Prime Minister Bill English treated this serious matter lightly saying Dr Yang was double-checking his application from 13 years ago, which was a cop-out.</p>
<p>“This week, leading academic Professor Anne-Marie <a href="https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2017/09/18/48616/expert-calls-for-inquiry-into-chinese-threat">Brady</a> said a special commission was needed to investigate China’s impact on our democracy.</p>
<p>“She said Australia was looking to introduce a law against foreign interference in domestic affairs.</p>
<p>“Besides Australia, the US, Canada, UK, Japan and EU are also deeply worried by China’s policy of expansionism and control.</p>
<p>“In five years China has taken over New Zealand’s milk infant formula industry and they have the back door key to our dairy industry added value.</p>
<p>“Silver Fern Farms, our biggest red meat exporter, fell to a Chinese takeover, with the deal going through last year.</p>
<p>“All over the country, National and local government politicians have talked of Chinese interests funding infrastructure.</p>
<p>“China is quietly starting to dominate the lives of New Zealanders and clearly our economic direction – National must explain,” says Mr Peters.</p>
