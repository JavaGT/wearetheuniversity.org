<p><strong>University of Waikato Continues to Climb Global Rankings</strong></p>
<p>The University of Waikato’s rapid ascent of the world university rankings was further confirmed today, with the release of the Times Higher Education (THE) rankings. The University is now ranked third equal in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The institution was one of only two New Zealand universities to improve their position in the internationally recognised THE rankings, which today placed the University of Waikato in the 351-400 band for all universities globally.</p>
<p>The THE announcement comes hot on the heels of the June QS rankings, which saw the University of Waikato claim its place among the top 300 universities in the world, out of more than 26,000 universities assessed.</p>
<p>“Today’s news is further confirmation that the University of Waikato is producing world-class graduates, and influencing national and global conversations through the quality of our research,” says University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Neil Quigley. “We were delighted to see the university ranked in the top 1.1% of the world’s universities in June and now, just a few months later, we welcome the THE rankings which have provided the strongest possible endorsement of the calibre of our staff and their unwavering commitment to student success and quality research.”</p>
<p>THE ranks universities across five areas; teaching, research, citations, industry income, and international outlook. The University of Waikato did particularly well in international outlook, reflecting its strong international research ties and education partnerships.</p>

<p>Professor Quigley says the university’s international success also reflected its growing centres of excellence in teaching and research. The University has 12 disciplines ranked in the top 250 of those delivered around the world, including computer science, economics, law, education and social sciences. The Waikato Management School also holds the much-coveted ‘Triple Crown’ accreditation status. The University has increasing impact in areas of global significance such as security, indigenous studies, health and wellbeing, environment and agriculture.</p>
<p>“Our rankings are a direct reflection of our ability to challenge, inspire and prepare our students to be future leaders,” says Professor Quigley. “It’s clear from our many international relationships with top institutions and universities around the world that we are considered an innovative and forward-looking partner. University of Waikato students are truly getting the best of all worlds when they come here to study.”</p>
