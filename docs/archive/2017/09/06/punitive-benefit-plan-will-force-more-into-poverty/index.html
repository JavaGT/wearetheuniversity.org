<p>Punitive benefit plan will force more into poverty</p>
<p>National’s latest cynical election promise of sanctions for beneficiaries is a distraction from the pressing issue of poverty in New Zealand, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>Bill English announced that beneficiaries who fail drug tests or refuse rehabilitation will have their benefits cut by 50 per cent or more.</p>
<p>“National’s latest cynical announcement ignores the evidence of how to properly treat drug addiction and will punish already vulnerable people,“ said Green Party inequality spokesperson Marama Davidson.</p>
<p>“We know that sanctions are expensive to administer and push people further into poverty.</p>
<p>“If you believe that people deserve help to overcome drug addiction, why would you turn around and push them under the poverty line if they struggle to overcome those habits?</p>
<p>“In the year to March, only 170 beneficiaries across the country were sanctioned for drug use – this is not the crisis that National are claiming it is.</p>
<p>“What is really shocking is the thousands of people living in cars and relying on foodbanks to have enough to eat, and cutting benefits will only make this worse.</p>
<p>“We believe that no one in New Zealand, whether they are working or not, should be living in poverty.</p>
<p>“The Green Party’s plan to end poverty will make a real difference to thousands of people’s lives and ensure that all families in New Zealand can afford to put food on the table, keep a roof over their head and pay their power bill,” said Ms Davidson.</p>
