<p><strong>Green Party announces a better deal for students</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party announced today that, in government, it will provide <a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/fair-deal-for-students">genuine support for students by</a> bringing in a universal post-graduate student allowance and increasing allowance rates for all students.</p>
<p>“The rise in the cost of living and higher rents are making life increasingly hard for students, and the Green Party has a plan to fix that,” said Green Party leader James Shaw.</p>
<p>“We will create a universal allowance for all post-graduate students and increase the base student allowance rate by 20 percent, as a first step towards a universal allowance for all students.</p>
<p>“With the universal post-graduate allowance, all post-graduate students under 24 years old and not living with their parents will receive $237 a week.</p>
<p>“Raising all allowances means that all eligible students under 24 years old not living with their parents will receive $39.50 more every week than they do now, and students over 24 not living with their parents will receive an extra $47.50 a week.</p>
<p>“This will reverse National’s short-sighted cuts and help encourage more students into post-graduate study, which we need if we are going to grow a smart, innovative economy.</p>
<p>“In addition to the rises in allowances, we are announcing our entire students package, which will help every single person in tertiary study or training.</p>
<p>“Our student Green Card guarantees free off-peak transport for all tertiary students and apprentices, saving students an additional $33 a week on average.</p>
<p>“We are also committed to quadrupling funding for student disability support services to $112 per student with disabilities.</p>
<p>“Students learning crucial skills like medicine and dentistry should be supported to complete their degrees, so we will abolish the seven year cap on student loans.</p>
<p>“In government, the Green Party will support Labour’s plan for three free years of tertiary education.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand needs smart tertiary policy that values the contribution students make to our economy and society, and in Government we will make that a reality,” said Mr Shaw.</p>
