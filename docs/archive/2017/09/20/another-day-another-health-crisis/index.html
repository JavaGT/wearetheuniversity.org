<p><strong>David Clark</strong><br>MP for Dunedin North<br>Health Spokesperson</p>
<p><strong>Another day – another health crisis</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www2.nzherald.co.nz/hamilton-news/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503366&objectid=11923944">News today</a> that the emergency department at Waikato has turned 180 patients away is another crisis for the Government and its besieged health system, says Labour’s Health spokesperson David Clark.</p>
<p>“It’s astonishing that the Government has had to rely on the private sector to take these patients that were turned away from the hospital over the past two and a half weeks.</p>
<p>“However, what is even more astonishing is that these patients were given vouchers for the Anglesea clinic that had to be used within 30 minutes of being issued.</p>
<p>“It’s another example of how Jonathan Coleman has lost control of his portfolio and is now overseeing an appallingly under-resourced health system.</p>
<p>“The Waikato District Health Board argues that it has been doing this for the last four years and that this is a cost effective way of dealing with ED peaks. But to most New Zealander this sounds more like an underfunded and under resourced service.</p>
<p>“The Minister must fess up and admit that the system has been substantially underfunded for the past nine years. We need to invest the $2.3 billion that is missing from health.</p>
<p>“This ongoing deterioration of our health system has to be fixed. We need a Labour Government this coming Saturday,” says David Clark.</p>
