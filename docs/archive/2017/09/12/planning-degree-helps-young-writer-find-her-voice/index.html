<p><strong>Planning degree helps young writer find her voice</strong></p>
<p>What do sci-fi and environmental planning have in common? The answer may seem elusive, but a Lincoln University graduate has combined the two to produce her first published novel, <em>Voiceless</em>.</p>
<p>Set in a near-future version of Timaru, the young adult novel tells the story of a teenager who is inflicted with an incurable disease that leaves her unable to speak or write.</p>
<p>The book, launched in July, also explores how the town might look in 50 years’ time.</p>
<p>To flesh out certain details, 24-year-old author Rachel Wilson drew on some of the knowledge she picked up in her Bachelor of Environmental Management and Planning course, which she completed at Lincoln University in 2013.</p>
<p>“Because I grew up in Timaru, I can remember the small changes that have happened even over the course of my lifetime so far,” she said.</p>
<p>“Names have changed, new subdivisions have appeared out of nowhere, and infrastructure and traffic patterns are constantly evolving.</p>
<p>“From that, I tried to extrapolate and think, ‘Okay, this is where we are now. What might it look like in another 50 years?’</p>
<p>“Then I tacked exponential growth and more advanced technology onto that, because it’s a science fiction book. It was a fascinating mental exercise.”</p>
<p>Ms Wilson’s future version of the town includes an underground subway network with commuter trains, while Central Timaru has become higher density with more high-rise buildings.</p>
<p>“With that much population growth, the town needs more land, so I created a whole new suburb called East Cape,” she said.</p>

<p>“It’s built on an extensive fictional area of reclaimed land at Dashing Rocks, a peninsula at the north end of Timaru’s famous sandy Caroline Bay.”</p>
<p>Ms Wilson said her first planning-related job after university had an impact on the idea for the novel, which she wrote under the pseudonym E G Wilson.</p>
<p>“I was working as a planner at the Timaru District Council in August 2015 when I had a spark of an idea for <em>Voiceless</em>.”</p>
<p>Associate Professor Hamish Rennie, one of Ms Wilson’s lecturers, said he was impressed by her ingenuity.</p>
<p>“It’s not quite what I expected our students to do, but she is the only student to ever have written an assignment for me that involved writing an environmental compliance manual for Mordor!”</p>
<p><em>Voiceless</em> was published by American company Atthis Arts. Its sequel,<em>Expression</em>, will be released next month.</p>
