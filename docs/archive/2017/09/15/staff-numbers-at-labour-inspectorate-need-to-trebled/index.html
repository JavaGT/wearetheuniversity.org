<p>Staff Numbers at Labour Inspectorate Need to Trebled</p>
<p>The latest case of a migrant worker being treated like a <a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/339373/migrant-worker-describes-modern-day-slavery-scam">slave</a> proves again the ineptitude of Immigration New Zealand and the Labour Inspectorate, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament, Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“To get residency this man had to pay $25,000 in cash to secure a job and was then ripped off so badly he is now homeless, jobless and doesn’t have a valid visa.</p>
<p>“When he complained of his exploitation to Immigration New Zealand they said he did not meet their threshold, whatever that is.</p>
<p>“Immigration New Zealand then passed the buck to the Labour Inspectorate who appear to have done nothing.</p>
<p>“Immigration NZ would probably have been aware that referring this man’s case on to the Labour Inspectorate would be a waste of time.</p>
<p>“The Labour Inspectorate has only 54 Inspectorate Officers for the entire country and has to deal with tens of thousands of workers.</p>
<p>“The disturbing thing is this man’s plight is being shared by many other migrants which the government ignores.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First will treble the number of Labour Inspectors across the country and any immigrant employers caught ripping off workers should face deportation,” says Mr Peters.</p>
