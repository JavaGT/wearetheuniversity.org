<p><strong>Auckland’s Hop Card Ripping Off Seniors</strong></p>
<p>Auckland Transport’s Hop card has been a bungled failure from the outset and the SuperGold Card should have been retained for off-peak travel, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament, Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“More than 14 months after Seniors were forcefully ‘tied’ to the Hop card it’s been revealed that a rule applies that says if the money on the card is not used within two months, then it becomes null and void and the card is useless.</p>
<p>“To get their money back, everyone, including Seniors have to beg Auckland Transport to re-load it.</p>
<p>“Besides being seriously inconvenienced, many Seniors are probably losing money. How much money is Auckland Transport collecting from this?</p>
<p>“Auckland Transport forced Seniors to get new cards and pay $15 for them; they wasted thousands of dollars issuing blue Hop cards that had to be cancelled; they forced Seniors to tag on and off public transport which was not required before; they blacklisted and cancelled cards and now they’re cancelling funds on the card.</p>
<p>“All of this would have been avoided had the free SuperGold Card been retained for off-peak travel.</p>
<p>“Auckland Transport did all this under the instructions of the National government. They did not have the sense to defy the government’s attempt to undermine the SuperGold Card.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First plans to introduce a new high tech SuperGold Card, and we’ll make sure it can be used for their free off-peak seats on public transport.</p>
<p>“Seniors will be able to load cash on to their new generation card, collect loyalty points and potentially save $800 and $1000 a year through no bank fees and retail discounts,” says Mr Peters.</p>
