<p><strong>Is Auckland’s Mayor Backtracking on Port Promises?</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First asks if Auckland Mayor, Phil Goff, is backtracking on his key election promise made last year to relocate the Ports of Auckland.</p>
<p>“When Mr Goff wanted votes he made a promise to Aucklanders that the Port was going to move out of the central city,” says New Zealand First Leader and MP for Northland, Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Yet speaking to the <em><a href="https://www.nbr.co.nz/article/goff-responds-nz-first-promise-move-aucklands-port-northport-vy-p-207171">National Business Review</a>,</em> he now says: “I’m in favour of moving it over time but I don’t think it can be done immediately. When we move, it has to be on the basis of a business case that stacks up and it has to be environmentally acceptable”.</p>
<p>“It is a massive climb-down <a href="https://www.nbr.co.nz/article/i-want-progress-plans-relocate-port-goff-ck-203092">on what he told that paper and RadioNZ only in May</a>, where he ‘wanted to progress plans to relocate the port’.</p>
<p>“Was it only last June that he also promised to move the port “for new homes, businesses and public spaces?” <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11650354">Telling the NZ Herald</a> that the port would hit container capacity in three years and that “the hard decisions had to be taken now”.</p>
<p>“While Mr Goff cites dividends of just over $50 million, that’s from a Port that sits on land that’s worth about $3 billion. As rates of return go that is not exactly flash.</p>

<p>“The truth is that Mr Goff was right last year. The current Port is running out of room fast and there are several thousand trucks a day trundling trough the city. The only place the Port can move to within the Auckland region is the sensitive Firth of Thames and that’s a non-starter environmentally.</p>
<p>“Northport is ready, willing and able to grow whereas the Port of Auckland can’t. If it cannot grow then it means the Port will go backwards costing ratepayers long term.</p>
<p>“If Aucklanders want their waterfront back and want to protect the long term value that the Port of Auckland currently holds then Northport is their future too,” says Mr Peters.</p>
