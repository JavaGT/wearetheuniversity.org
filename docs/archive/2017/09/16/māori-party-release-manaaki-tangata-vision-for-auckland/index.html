<p><strong>Māori Party release ‘manaaki tangata’ vision for Auckland</strong></p>
<p>The Māori Party announced their plan for Auckland today at Māngere Markets, entitled <em>Manaaki Tangata - No One Left Behind</em>.</p>
<p>“The Māori Party wants an Auckland where tangata whenua, Māori and Pacific peoples in this city are not left behind. An Auckland where whānau are strong and independent,” the party’s candidate for Tāmaki Makaurau, Shane Taurima, told the crowd gathered at the popular Saturday morning market.</p>
<p>The plan covers the actions the party will take, if it is part of the next Government, to address homelessness, low wages, whānau trying to rise above poverty, unemployment and family violence, te reo Māori revitalisation as well as powering up whānau-owned businesses in the country’s largest city.</p>
<p>“I’ve door knocked thousands of homes here and I’ve heard the karanga, the call of our families who want more than mere political change but change that can stand the test of time.</p>
<p>“Our party seeks nothing less than transformational change that lifts our people from dependence and deprivation to dignity.”</p>
<p>Some features of the plan include:</p>
<p>• Obliging Government and Auckland Council to set a target to eliminate homelessness by 2020.<br>• Building houses that whānau on low incomes can afford to rent in areas of Auckland where there is severe housing deprivation – 500 of which will be in South Auckland.<br>• Investing an additional $5 million into Whānau Ora in Auckland so we can support 5000 whānau facing challenging issues across housing, unemployment and family violence.<br>• Providing free doctors’ visits and prescriptions for under 18 year olds.<br>• Creating 1,000 apprenticeships for rangatahi living in Auckland.<br>• Introducing earn as they learn programmes for youth in Auckland<br>• Providing free public transport for students and over 60 year olds.<br>• Making Auckland a bilingual city.<br>• Introducing a Iiving wage as well as an Auckland wage.<br>• Setting up a $5 million fund for new start up Auckland-based small to medium size businesses with a focus on Māori and Pacific families.<br>• Investing an additional $5 million into Marae Ora to restore Auckland marae and make them eco and digital friendly.<br>• Reinstating the position of Minister for Auckland Issues.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.maoriparty.org/our_kaupapa">Manaakitanga</a> is at the core of our plan which is realistic, won’t run the country bankrupt and will build on many of the gains we’ve achieved in the past nine years,” said Mr Taurima.</p>
