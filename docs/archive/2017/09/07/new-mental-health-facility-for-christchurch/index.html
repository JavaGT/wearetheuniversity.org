<p>Media statement</p>
<p>7 September 2017</p>
<p>New mental health facility for Christchurch</p>
<p>National List MP Nuk Korako has welcomed today’s announcement that Canterbury is to receive a $47 – $57 million new purpose built specialist mental health facility.</p>
<p>Mr Korako accompanied Health Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman and Prime Minister Bill English as they visited the Christchurch Hospital to make the announcement today.</p>
<p>“Mental health is one of our most challenging social issues and it affects a large number of New Zealanders. In Canterbury, demand for mental health services has increased significantly since the earthquakes and the long-term impact of those quakes are still being felt.</p>
<p>“We know how important it is for services to be moved from The Princess Margaret Hospital, so I was thrilled to read in the indicative business plan, released today, that a new mental health facility could be built within three years.</p>
<p>“This announcement represents a significant step forward and shows the Government’s ongoing commitment to Canterbury’s recovery.”</p>
<p>The Government invested $224 million into mental health at Budget 2017. This includes $100 million which is being invested into 17 new initiatives which signal a move towards a great focus on prevention and earlier intervention, as well as building resilience.</p>
<p>This investment through Budget 2017 builds on the $1.4 billion spent on mental health and addiction services in the last year.</p>
