<p>Increasing elective surgeries to 200,000 a year</p>
<p>Over the next four years National will further increase the number of elective surgeries to 200,000 a year, ensuring access to life-changing operations like hip replacements for thousands more New Zealanders, Health spokesperson Jonathan Coleman says.</p>
<p>“Under National, access to elective surgery has increased every year, and we will continue to do more,” Dr Coleman says.</p>
<p>“Elective surgery makes a real difference to patients and their families – it reduces pain, restores independence and improves quality of life.</p>
<p>“As New Zealanders live longer, access to elective surgery is becoming more important than ever. Doing more is crucial.</p>
<p>“Health has been National’s top funding priority in Government, and our strong economy has allowed us to continuously increase access to world-class health services like elective surgeries in a sustainable manner.</p>
<p>“When we came into office there were 118,000 elective surgeries being delivered each year and they were increasing by only 1,400 a year.</p>
<p>“We’ve changed that. Under National the number of elective surgeries carried out by DHBs has increased by 56,000 to 174,000 surgeries every year and they&#39;re expected to reach 178,000 this year.</p>
<p>“That’s tens of thousands more life changing operations such as joint replacements, cataracts, cancerous skin lesions and cardiac surgeries – and we are committed to doing more.</p>
<p>“Over the next four years we will increase the number of elective surgeries by an average of 5,500 more operations a year meaning we will be doing 200,000 elective surgeries a year by 2021/2022.</p>

<p>“To support this National will increase spending on elective surgery by $30 million per year for the next four years, rising to $120m per year by 2020/21 - part of our record investment in health.</p>
<p>“This is a significant increase and demonstrates our commitment to further increasing access to healthcare for New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“Only National can manage the economy while also continuing to increase access to the world-class health services people need,” Dr Coleman says.</p>
