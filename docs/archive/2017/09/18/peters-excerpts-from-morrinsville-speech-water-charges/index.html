<p><strong>Monday, 18 September 2017, 1:46 pm</strong><br><strong>Speech: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Peters; Excerpts From Morrinsville Speech<br>Water Charges: Labour And National</p>
<p>Farming in New Zealand has always been based around handing your farm to the next generation, better than you found it.</p>
<p>Today, we gather here because of the attacks from those in Labour and the Greens, and from some in the commentariat.</p>
<p>It is the third time we have been in Morrinsville since last December. That’s the importance that New Zealand First puts on sustainable farming.</p>
<p>Sadly there are some who will tax you out of business, not realising they will send the country bankrupt at the same time,</p>
<p>We know Labour want over $500m from water because that’s what they told Radio New Zealand before they spun “1 of 2 cents a cubic metre.”</p>
<p>Mathematicians will clock that 1 to 2 cents is a 100% variation.</p>
<p>So Labour really wants 10 cents a cubic metre. They also want a Land Tax, a Capital Gains Tax and as they opposed Gift Duty’s abolition, that could back as well.</p>
<p>They want farming fully into the ETS at another $30,000 per farm.</p>
<p>There’s zero room for regret on Sunday. Buy yourself insurance and help us get farmers like our Waikato candidate, Stu Husband into Parliament.</p>
<p>But there’s another reason why you must Party Vote New Zealand First.</p>
<p>It is to stop the National Party going down a racially divisive abyss.</p>
<p>One that will cost far more money than Labour’s charges and for the people here, we have the written proof.</p>
<p>In April, we wrote to every National MP asking them to stop race-based planning. What did National MP’s do? They put Mana Whakahono ā Rohe Agreements and race-based consenting into the RMA. That’s the modern urban National Party.</p>

<p>We bet National hasn’t told you that, in March, Tuwharetoa started demanding rent to use Lake Taupo. What did National do? Minister Finlayson offered taxpayers’ money to ‘mediate this as some commercial dispute’. That’s National saying Maori now own the waters of Lake Taupo. How long before you get the invoices?</p>
<p>Has the Prime Minister told you about his cosy and regular meetings with Iwi, where reallocating your water consents to Iwi is being openly discussed?</p>
<p>Remember the trauma of Variation 6 in the Waikato Region? There’s a race-based sequel coming from after the election.</p>
<p>Or Waikato-Tainui saying water consents are “a right in property” that they should own. Based on Minister Finlayson’s inactions, National will give them ownership too meaning Koha for Water.</p>
<p>And has any National MP, or Minister, told you that it intends to reveal its water allocation and charging IN DECEMBER?</p>
<p>Do you want a National Government that needs the support of the Maori Party?</p>
<p>A Party that openly says Iwi owns water and wants a water tax of 10 cents a cubic metre raising $583m from non-Maori for Maori?</p>
<p>If it comes down to losing their Ministerial BMWs, or kowtowing to the Maori Party, which way do you think this urban liberal National Party will go?</p>
<p>The only guarantee you have against a Maori Party controlled National Party, and to farm for generations, is to Party Vote New Zealand First.</p>
<p>Left or Right we are your only bet for the common sense centre ground.</p>
