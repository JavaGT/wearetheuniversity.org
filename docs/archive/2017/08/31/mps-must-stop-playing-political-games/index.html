<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong>FROM: Stu Husband, New Zealand First Candidate for the Waikato Electorate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>DATE: 31 August 2017 – for immediate release.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Members of Parliament must stop playing political games and get on with the job.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Morrinsville</strong> – Stu Husband, the New Zealand First Candidate for the Waikato Electorate, has described the conduct of MPs and the political games that are played as the ugly side of politics that must stop.</p>
<p>“The political games that MPs play are the ugly side of politics. It is a side of politics that many people, including myself, do not like at all. It is that kind of behaviour that has slowly eroded the public’s faith in their elected politicians. I find that kind of behaviour counter-productive and an insult to the people of this country, said Husband.</p>
<p>They say that underhand tactics and the like are just part of politics, so you have to play the game to survive. Sadly, this is true to a certain extent, but it should not be used as an excuse to let it happen all the time or use it as a pass for bad behaviour. This is a weak excuse. Frankly, this type of behaviour will continue to turn people off politics and anger them in the process.” he added.</p>
<p>Husband believes that this behaviour is made worse when politicians that enter Parliament do not have the other skills needed.</p>
<p>“The experience of this week and the mudslinging that constantly occurs highlights the point that elected politicians, especially Members of Parliament, need to be more than nice or popular people. They need experience in governing organisations and people, they also need to skills in strategy, law, public systems, and policy as well. It is not enough to go into Parliament with good intentions. Good intentions must be backed by skills” he said.</p>

<p>Husband believes that he has the whole set of skills needed to be effective and actually do something, not just speak about issues. This ability has been developed through my governance roles with the: Waikato Regional Council; Federated Farmers – National Sharemilkers Employment Executive, Waikato Sharemilkers Employers Section, Dairy Section; school boards of trustees; and as a Company Director.</p>
<p>“The people of the Waikato Electorate finally have a candidate that has the skills and networks that will get the Electorate moving again,” said Husband.</p>
