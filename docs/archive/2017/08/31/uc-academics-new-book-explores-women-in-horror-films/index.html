<p><strong>UC academic’s new book explores women in horror films</strong></p>
<p>A pop culture expert’s new book is set to make a unique contribution in the field of horror scholarship by exploring the “privileged place” that women hold in the horror film genre.</p>
<p>A lecturer in English and Cultural Studies in the University of Canterbury’s College of Arts, author Dr Erin Harrington is an expert in ‘gynaehorror’, a term she coined and which is the focus of her new book, <em>Women, Monstrosity and Horror Film</em> (Routledge, 2017).</p>
<p>Covering topics ranging from “psychobiddies, grande dames and horrific harridans” to virgins and <em>vagina dentata</em>, the academic book makes a unique contribution to the study of women in horror film specifically, while providing new insights in the broader area of popular culture, gender and film philosophy.</p>
<p>Dr Harrington describes gynaehorror as horror films concerned with all aspects of female reproductive horror, from reproductive and sexual organs, to virginity, pregnancy, birth, motherhood and menopause.</p>
<p>“Think classic films like <em>Rosemary&#39;s Baby</em> or <em>The Brood</em> or even the _Alien_series, or more recent films like <em>The Witch</em> and <em>The Babadook</em>. Horror films are a great social barometer as they engage with and often directly invoke culturally specific and contemporaneous fears and anxieties,” she says.</p>

<p>“Engaging with these films, as with other forms of popular culture, can help us understand and interrogate taken-for-granted ideas about what it is women ‘should’ do and be.”</p>
<p>Published in the Routledge series <em>Film Philosophy at the Margins</em>, the book features an in-depth analysis of the portrayal of women in horror films from the 1960s until the present day.</p>
<p>“Women occupy a privileged place in horror film. Horror is a space of entertainment and excitement, of terror and dread, and one that relishes the complexities that arise when boundaries – of taste, of bodies, of reason – are blurred and dismantled,” Dr Harrington says.</p>
<p>Some of the themes explored in <em>Women, Monstrosity and Horror Film</em> include:</p>
<p>• the intersection of horror, monstrosity and sexual difference;</p>
<p>• the relationships between normative female (hetero)sexuality and the twin figures of the chaste virgin and the voracious <em>vagina dentata</em>;</p>
<p>• embodiment and subjectivity in horror films about pregnancy and abortion;</p>
<p>• reproductive technologies, monstrosity and ‘mad science’;</p>
<p>• the discursive construction and interrogation of monstrous motherhood; and</p>
<p>• the relationships between menopause, menstruation, hagsploitation and ‘abject barren’ bodies in horror.</p>
<p>Dr Harrington’s book not only offers a feminist interrogation of gynaehorror, but also a counter-reading of the gynaehorrific, that both accounts for and opens up new spaces of productive, radical and subversive monstrosity within a mode of representation and expression that has often been accused of being misogynistic.</p>
<p>Dr Harrington’s research and academic work focuses on horror, embodiment, popular and visual culture, and sex and gender, and she also has a particular interest in theatre, criticism and dramaturgy. She has written for a range of literary and academic publications, art catalogues, and popular media outlets, and she regularly appears as a speaker and panellist.</p>
