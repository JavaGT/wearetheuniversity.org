<p>21 August 2017</p>
<p>The University of Auckland has joined the Auckland Primary Principals Association (APPA) to host an expo to drive teacher recruitment in the city.</p>
<p>The Primary Teaching Recruitment Expo 2017 will be held at Eden Park’s Level 5 lounge on Thursday 24 August from 2-7pm.</p>
<p>The expo will be attended by 40 primary school principals from across the Auckland region. It is estimated they already have approximately 120-160 vacancies across their schools for the 2018 year.</p>
<p>The University’s Dean of Education and Social Work, Professor Graeme Aitken, says schools have been feeling the pinch for a while now with vacancies that urgently need filling.</p>
<p>“We have some wonderful graduates who would relish the opportunity to get in front of principals. The expo gives them a great chance of getting a job and helping fill the vacancy gaps.”</p>
<p>The University is assisting students who want to attend the expo by setting up a temporary crèche at Eden Park and giving petrol vouchers.</p>
<p>Expo organiser, Auckland Primary Principals’ Association president Kevin Bush, has been a principal for 24 years, the last 14 at Te Hihi School in South Auckland.</p>
<p>He has already seen schools suffer with a lack of teachers about 20 years ago. But back then an influx of teachers from the UK, Australia and Canada helped the situation.</p>
<p>But this time the situation is worsened by the number of teachers leaving Auckland because of the rising cost of living.</p>
<p>“There are schools that are advertising four or five times and there are schools that have five or six vacancies in them.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard of schools where they have three classes split across two teachers and a teacher aid in there to support them because they can’t find a third teacher.”</p>
<p>“I know that there are principals beginning to experience this and are tearing their hair out.”</p>
<p>He says the situation needs to be addressed urgently by the Government.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that they’re reluctant, I don’t think they’ve realised the severity of the situation until just recently and they’re scrambling for ideas.”</p>
<p>Dr Fiona Ell, Head of Initial Teacher Education at the faculty, says the University was drawn to be part of the expo to give their 2017 graduates a boost to get a job in 2018.</p>
<p>“We have 220 primary teachers completing their study this year, this expo gets them talking to principals directly about jobs starting in 2018.”</p>
<p>Students, as well as former teachers returning to the profession, should bring their best “elevator pitch” to engage in short discussions with principals from a variety of primary and intermediate schools, an A4 double sided Curriculum Vitae including a short personal statement about yourself, why you want to be a teacher and what your personal interests and passions are outside teaching.</p>
<p>The Primary Teaching Recruitment Expo 2017 will be held at Eden Park’s Level 5 lounge on Thursday 24 August from 2-7pm.</p>
