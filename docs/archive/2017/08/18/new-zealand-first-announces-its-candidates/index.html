<p><strong>Anne-Marie Andrews – Coromandel</strong></p>
<p>A home builder and joint owner of investment and import companies <strong>Ms Andrews</strong> is a forthright advocate of strong community values. <strong>Ms Andrews</strong> has engaged in mentoring, counselling and facilitation activities and is a previous Regional Manager for Parents Inc.</p>
<p><strong>Lester Grey – Bay Of Plenty</strong></p>
<p>Bay of Plenty businessman, <strong>Lester Gray,</strong> is an owner and operator of service stations throughout the Bay of Plenty and is a very experienced business leader with a record of success within the petroleum and convenience retail sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Julian Tilley – East Coast</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mr Tilley</strong> is the Bay of Plenty/East Coast Sales Manager for a leading diversified petroleum distribution company. He also has a strong background in IT having previously worked in that industry both in New Zealand and overseas.</p>
<p><strong>Increasing minimum wage</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First will build our economy from the bottom up, creating opportunities for New Zealanders, boosting our economy and increasing productivity.</p>
<p>Our goal is to increase the minimum wage to $20 over three years.</p>
<p>Drastically increasing the minimum wage will increase productivity and stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>New Zealand First’s record on fair wages in this country is a</p>
<p>proud one.</p>
<p>In 2005 we campaigned to address the then low minimum wage under the Labour government.</p>
<p>As part of our confidence and supply agreement with Labour in 2005 following the election we insisted that the minimum wage go from $9 per hour to $12 progressively by 2008.</p>
<p>That is the biggest rise ever in the shortest time ever in this country’s history.</p>
<p>We know that without a change in tax for Employers and Businesses that can’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>Employers - Business tax package</strong></p>
<p>Accordingly, we will:</p>
<p>- introduce a tax package for New Zealand Employers and Businesses to negate the increased cost to employers and businesses of paying fair wages.</p>
<p><strong>Removing GST on basic food</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First will lower the family food bill by removing GST on basic essential food.</p>
<p>By lowering the cost of the household food basket we will bring much needed relief to thousands of low income New Zealanders.</p>
<p>GST would come off all basic food items – not restaurant and takeaway meals.</p>
<p>This is a bold policy which goes to the heart of inequality that is undermining our society.</p>
<p>There are estimated to be 212,000 children in poverty in New Zealand.</p>
<p>In April this year the Salvation Army said 20 per cent of New Zealand children were living in a household that regularly goes without essentials such as adequate food, clothing or heating. That’s one in every five children in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The cost of removing GST on basic essential food is somewhere between $600 million and $700 million.</p>
<p>And for those armchair critics who have long forgotten, or have never known “struggle street”, who don’t know what basic or essential food is - I recommend they ask their grandmother.</p>
<p><strong>Clampdown on Tax Evasion</strong></p>
<p>Behind closed doors the National government has been heavied by giant multinational bully boys over a proposed tax clampdown and our government buckled like wimps.</p>
<p>Multinationals are evading paying tax in New Zealand of between $7 billion to $10 billion a year.</p>
<p>It’s a rort.</p>
<p>They’re getting away with it and the government is letting them.</p>
<p>A shady outfit from the United States no-one has heard of, the Digital Economy Group, pressured the New Zealand government and won.</p>
<p>The so-called crusher Revenue Minister Judith Collins was crushed.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Steven Joyce, huddled behind his desk and waved a white flag.</p>
<p>The giant multi-nationals want to paralyse the OECD.</p>
<p>They’re now doing the same to the National government.</p>
<p>And they’re succeeding.</p>
<p>Given the Labour Party’s already announced policy on taxing multinational corporations to raise $200 million, it seems that like the National government they have already caved in even without having discussions with the secretive international group.</p>
<p>New Zealand First would clamp down on these giants who cheat us.</p>
<p>We are going to clamp down on tax evasion.</p>
<p>Multination corporations will be required to pay fair tax in New Zealand.</p>
<p>For example Tegel, with its $614 million turnover pays only .38 percent of tax (profit was $34.2 million).</p>
<p>This will end under New Zealand First.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This campaign is being portrayed as a battle between Labour and National. It’s not. Red or blue, Pepsi and Coke, there’s nothing different.</p>
<p>If you want to vote for a real change then there is one option.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget that this economic policy that has governed this country for 33 years was started by Labour and both Labour and National still subscribe to it.</p>
<p>If you want a real change after this election, if you have had enough of just changing the team colours - but getting the same result then party vote New Zealand First.</p>
