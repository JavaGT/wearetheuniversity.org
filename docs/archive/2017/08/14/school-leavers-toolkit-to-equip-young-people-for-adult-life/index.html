<p><strong>Monday, 14 August 2017, 12:09 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>School Leavers’ Toolkit to equip young people for adult life</strong></p>
<p>Labour will give school leavers the practical skills and knowledge they need for adult life with a new School Leavers’ Toolkit, says Leader of the Opposition Jacinda Ardern.</p>
<p>“Our teachers and schools do a great job of teaching our children core knowledge and learning skills. Our education system is one of the best in the world.</p>
<p>“However, the Future of Work Commission identified the need to do better in giving young people the practical skills that they need, in the workplace, in their day- to-day lives, and as members of the community. Businesses say they need young workers with these skills.</p>
<p>“Having a driving licence so you can get to work, knowing how to fit into a workplace, knowing how to manage your money, and knowing how to take your place in the community – these are all important skills in adult life, and we need to do more to ensure our young people are equipped with them.</p>
<p>“Labour’s School Leavers’ Toolkit will help students learn to drive, understand practical budgeting, be equipped with workplace skills, and learn how our political system operates through civics education at school. Every secondary school will be resourced to provide these courses.</p>
<p>“Some schools, iwi, and community groups provide this kind of education alongside the core curriculum with great results, but the approach is ad hoc and varies across the country. Labour will ensure the toolkit is available for all students.</p>
<p>“Our young people need a world-leading education, and the skills to live in the real world. Labour will ensure they have both. Let’s do this,” says Jacinda Ardern.</p>
