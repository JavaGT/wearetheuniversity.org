<p><strong>Monday, 14 August 2017, 5:00 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>National Backs Race-Based Water Taxes. Had Enough?</strong>  </p>
<p>New Zealand First says National is the pot calling Labour’s kettle black over taxes on water, with National writing water ‘Koha for Consent’ into Deeds of Settlement.</p>
<p>“National provisioning Koha for Consent is as bad as Labour’s food and production tax on water,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland, Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Both will add to what hard working Kiwis have to pay at the supermarket checkout.</p>
<p>“While Labour’s numbers on water are all over the show – from $58.3 million to $500m, and half a trillion arising from their October 21, 2015 statement - National has given certain Iwi a secret deal.</p>
<p>“It is all in Minister Chris Finlayson’s attack on the Labour Party in today’s <em>NZ Herald,</em> that is the moment any political party crosses the Water Tax Rubicon, Iwi will be first to line up and benefit – the leaders will but the people will get nothing.</p>
<p>“Instead of environmental improvements, money will fill the coffers of those who make up the Freshwater Iwi Leaders’ Group.</p>
<p>“This is as serious as it gets. The two old parties has National selling out and writing race-based water ownership into law whilst accusing Labour’s proposed water tax of being the trigger to justify it. The two old parties are constructing a nightmare for the New Zealand economy.</p>
<p>“It is hidden in the Tuwharetoa Deed of Settlement that National negotiated and Labour backs. Extracts of which are with this statement and the public need to ask themselves this question: ‘Why did they not tell us of their secret plans?’</p>

<p>“A morally weak National Party has agreed to a ‘market-based regime for resource allocation’ and to ‘establish a regime of tradeable rights or tradeable permits in water’ – all based on race.</p>
<p>“All it needs is what Labour is proposing with its food and production tax on water. From the price of cabbages to electricity prices, families - many of them Maori who are up against it - will see what little the two parties have transferred to enrich big Iwi and government coffers. All the while the export wealth creators of this country are being attacked by certain politicians.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First cannot and will not support more racial separatism and more expensive food and power prices from either party. We are certain that New Zealanders when they know more about this will have had enough,” says Mr Peters.</p>
<p><strong>ENDS</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXTRACTS FROM THE DEED OF SETTLEMENT (8 JULY 2017)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Rights and interests in water and geothermal resources not affected</strong><br>4.15 The Crown acknowledges that -<br>4.15.1 particular iwi/hapu have rights and interests in specific water and geothermal resources in their rohe; and<br>4.15.2 the Crown is presently engaged in a process of policy review and reform in relation to the management of freshwater in New Zealand that includes the consideration of issues relating to water use, allocation and rights and interests. That process includes discussions at a national level in which Ngati Tuwharetoa are involved through, among other things, the Freshwater Iwi Leaders Group.</p>
<p>4.18 One of the wider aspirations of Ngati Tuwharetoa is for the Crown to recognise and provide for those rights and interests. This includes provision being made for the interests of Ngati Tuwharetoa in any future policy reform in relation to water and geothermal resources, including the introduction of economic interests such as a market-based regime for resource allocation.</p>
<p>4.19 In the 2010 deed in relation to co-governance and co-management arrangements for the Waikato River, the Crown agreed that it will not, without first engaging with Ngati Tuwharetoa in good faith -<br>4.19.1 establish a regime of tradeable rights or tradeable permits in water within the area of interest; or<br>4.19.2 establish or confer management or use rights of a nature and/or duration that in effect create rights of property in the waters of the Waikato River or Lake Taupo (Taupomoana) or Lake Rotoaira or other waters within the area of interest; or<br>4.19.3 finalise policy or introduce any legislation which in effect amounts to the privatisation of the waters within area of interest.  </p>
<p><strong>Establishment and purpose of Te Kopua</strong> <strong>Kanapanapa</strong><br>6.1 The settlement legislation will establish a statutory body, called Te Kopua Kanapanapa.</p>
<p>6.9 Despite the composition of Te Kopua Kanapanapa as described in clause 6.19, Te Kopua Kanapanapa is deemed to be a joint committee of the Waikato Regional Council and Taupo District Council within the meaning of clause 30(1)(b) of Schedule 7 of the Local Government Act 2002.</p>
<p>6.10 Despite Schedule 7 of the Local Government Act 2002, Te Kopua Kanapanapa -<br>6.10.1 is a permanent committee and is not discharged following each triennial election; and<br>6.10.2 must not be dissolved unless all appointers agree to Te Kopua Kanapanapa being dissolved.  </p>
<p><strong>Functions of Te Kopua Kanapanapa</strong><br>6.13 Te Kopua Kanapanapa has the following specific functions:<br>6.13.1 to promote the restoration, protection, and enhancement of the environmental, cultural and spiritual well-being of the Taupo Catchment:<br>6.13.2 to prepare and approve Te Kaupapa Kaitiaki that identifies the values, vision, objectives, desired outcomes and other relevant matters for the Taupo Catchment:<br>6.13.3 to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of Te Kaupapa Kaitiaki:<br>6.13.4 to advise local authorities and relevant agencies regarding projects, initiatives, action or research intended to restore, protect or enhance the health and wellbeing of the Taupo Catchment:<br>6.13.5 to support the integrated and collaborative management of the Taupo Catchment:<br>6.13.6 to support the integrated management of the Taupo Catchment with the management of the Waikato River and the Whanganui River:<br>6.13.7 to engage with, seek advice from and provide advice to local authorities and other relevant agencies on matters relating to the health and well-being of the Taupo Catchment:<br>6.13.8 to establish and maintain a register of accredited hearing commissioners:<br>6.13.9 to participate in any statutory and non-statutory process that concerns or has implications for the health and well-being of the Taupo Catchment, including by making submissions on planning or resource consent processes under the Resource Management Act 1991:<br>6.13.10 to carry out any functions referred to in clause 6.17:<br>6.13.11 to take any other action that Te Kopua Kanapanapa considers appropriate to achieving its purpose.  </p>
<p><strong>Other entities</strong><br>6.14 There are a number of entities that have been established between Ngati Tuwharetoa representatives, the Taupo District Council and Waikato Regional Council respectively, and other groups within the Taupo Catchment.<br>6.15 Following the signing of this deed, there will be ongoing discussions with the parties referred to in clause 6.14 to ascertain whether any rationalisation may occur.  </p>
<p><strong>6: TE POU TUARUA: TE MATAPUNA O TE WAI, TE AHI TAMOU</strong><br><strong>Procedures</strong><br>6.16 Te Kopua Kanapanapa will develop procedures focussed on promoting an integrated approach with -<br>6.16.1 the Waikato River Authority and the arrangements provided for in the Waikato River legislation; and<br>6.16.2 Te Awa Tupua, and the arrangements provided for in the Te Awa Tupua legislation in relation to the Whanganui River catchment.</p>
<p>6.17 To avoid doubt, except as provided for in clause 6.13.2, Te Kopua Kanapanapa has discretion to determine in any particular circumstances -<br>6.17.1 whether to exercise any function identified in clause 6.13; and<br>6.17.2 how, and to what extent, any function identified in clause 6.13 is exercised.  </p>
<p><strong>Capacity</strong><br>6.18 Te Kopua Kanapanapa -<br>6.18.1 will have all the powers reasonably necessary to carry out its functions in a manner consistent with -<br>(a) this part; and<br>(b) subject to clause 6.18.1(a), the local government legislation; and<br>6.18.2 may perform any function of a local authority if and to the extent that function has been delegated to it by the local authority.</p>
