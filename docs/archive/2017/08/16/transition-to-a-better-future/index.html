<p><strong>Christchurch cathedral</strong></p>
<p>We are meeting here in the Transitional Cathedral and the word transition is appropriate.</p>
<p>Not just for the Anglican diocese, but for the city of Christchurch.</p>
<p>The transition from the devastation of the earthquakes, as most if not all of you would agree, has been unnecessarily slow and drawn out.</p>
<p>The original cathedral which stands wane and broken symbolises that.</p>
<p>The option of gifting the cathedral to the people of New Zealand should have been considered years back.</p>
<p>And the government, realising the importance of this building for the heritage of Christchurch, should have stepped in and started rebuilding. With the insurance proceeds dedicated to that purpose.</p>
<p>When we last visited Christchurch at the beginning of July we said if rebuilding doesn’t start, we would make sure it happens straight after the election.</p>
<p>We stick by that.</p>
<p><strong>Slow rebuild</strong></p>
<p>The procrastination, dawdling and delays over the rebuild have held your city back.</p>
<p>It is seen with your convention centre.</p>
<p>You were promised it in 2017, then it became 2018, then 2019 and now it is 2020 – three years late.</p>
<p>Before the earthquakes Christchurch had 24 percent of NZ’s conference market.</p>
<p>That has shrunk to 9 percent.</p>
<p>You are missing out on millions of dollars.</p>
<p>I refer to Mike Yardley’s article yesterday, in which he wrote:</p>
<p><em>“In fact, if you dust off the Cost Sharing Agreement, you&#39;ll struggle to find one project that&#39;s been faithfully delivered on time. The Metro Sports Facility was meant to open last year, the council-led Central Library was scheduled for 2015 and the much-maligned stadium project was envisaged for completion in the autumn of this year, before the council deferred its funding commitment of $253 million, for the best part of a decade.</em></p>
<p><em>In his final act as Regeneration Minister, Gerry Brownlee, in concert with the Christchurch Mayor, actioned a pre-feasibility study to be undertaken on a multi-purpose indoor arena, with a seating capacity of between 25,000-35,000. The study was scheduled for completion in late July. That&#39;s now been pushed back until later this month – just weeks before the election. Even if work commenced next week, it won&#39;t be completed until 2022.”</em></p>
<p>Even the Courts project, like the rest, is way behind time.</p>
<p>None of this evidences a government that is committed to Christchurch or Canterbury.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of innovation</strong></p>
<p>There has been too much lethargy and lack of innovative thinking in your rebuild.</p>
<p>Why, for example, wasn’t wood used more?</p>
<p>Sir Bob Jones is about to build the world’s tallest wooden skyscraper in the world on the corner of Featherstone and Brandon streets in Wellington.</p>
<p>He has plans for another wooden skyscraper in Auckland.</p>
<p>This is the way the world is going and he is moving with it.</p>
<p>He said it was time shipping massive volumes of whole logs out of New Zealand for foreign owners and countries to get all the add-on value should end.</p>
<p>New Zealand First has been saying this for years.</p>
<p>He believes, as New Zealand First does, that we should be supplying China, the biggest high rise market in the world, with engineered timber.</p>
<p>The problem is the old parties have let eight of our biggest ten major forestry companies become foreign owned.</p>
<p>These companies are levelling entire forests at unsustainable levels.</p>
<p>This is just one example of what happens when you have governments which let massive amounts of New Zealand land and assets be sold off and controlled by foreign interests.</p>
<p>New Zealand First will change that.</p>
<p><strong>Covered stadium – multi-purpose arena – NZ First proposal</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First asks also, why can’t Christchurch and Canterbury have a decent covered multi-use sports stadium to be used for top rugby and other events?</p>
<p>You missed out on having a Lions rugby test this winter for the first time ever.</p>
<p>You are being treated like a backwater and falling behind.</p>
<p>With the Crusaders you have the Super 15 champions.</p>
<p>But you’ve got a second rate temporary stadium not worthy of you or your champions.</p>
<p>New Zealand First will back a covered multi-use stadium being built in Christchurch.</p>
<p>We realise the cost should not fall entirely on ratepayers and so we will look seriously at the government contributing.</p>
<p>But we make two provisos:</p>
<p>One, that you build a 24/7 revenue earning, multi purpose complex where sporting and entertainment events occasionally happen.</p>
<p>The emphasis is a 24/7 revenue stream where sport happens sometimes.</p>
<p>Two, that the stadium is built with wood - and wood grown in New Zealand – as a serious preference.</p>
<p>You have the technology and know-how here to make it happen, as shown with the Pres-Lam technology developed at the University of Canterbury.</p>
<p><strong>Labour filches NZ First policy</strong></p>
<p>We have heard a lot about water in the past week or so.</p>
<p>Firstly Labour swiped our policy on royalties being paid back to the regions from which bottled water is being taken.</p>
<p>This was our policy.</p>
<p>Then they intend to tax farmers, fruit and vegetable growers, vineyard owners and other primary producers.</p>
<p>Their figures were all over the show saying a tax would bring in from $58.3 million to $500 million.</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s finance spokesman Grant Robertson said on Saturdaythe likely rate for irrigators would be between 1 or 2 cents per 1000 litres.</p>
<p>Earlier the Labour leader said they would work alongside those in the industry and sort it out – after the election.</p>
<p>Which of all these statements is true?</p>
<p>National has said Labour’s tax policy would force previous iwi settlements to be reopened. And National loaded up their legislation like RMA reform with race-based provisions and dual management. It is not one law for all now but different laws based on race.</p>
<p>We are heading down a dangerous path.</p>
<p><strong>Combating pollution</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First acknowledges we have a serious problem with pollution of our waterways.</p>
<p>We have some of the most polluted rivers in the Western world.</p>
<p>Here in Canterbury nitrate levels are much higher than anywhere else in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Under our Royalties for the Regions policy, companies exporting water will have to pay royalties which will go back to the region where the water came from.</p>
<p>We say that money can be used to help clean up our rivers and lakes.</p>
<p>There must be economic development, our primary industries have to flourish, but it must be balanced with responsible environmental stewardship.</p>
<p>Also, we believe the $1.4 billion New Zealand is spending buying carbon credits from foreigners can be put to far better use – like cleaning up our waterways.</p>
<p>NZ First does not support the Wall Street-like Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>
<p>We stand for a UK-Norway style Climate Change Act. We will use our resources, our industry and our workers to play our part.</p>
<p><strong>Water consents</strong></p>
<p>We want the transferring of water consents to stop when the original reason for gaining the consent ceases.</p>
<p>It’s appalling that businesses allocated a water consent, but no longer need it, are selling it off at huge profit of between $50,000 to $500,000.</p>
<p>In the last five years Environment Canterbury has transferred 494 water permits between properties in a decade, 290 of those in the last five years.</p>
<p>Councils get nothing.</p>
<p>The National government has claimed no one owns the water.</p>
<p>Clearly that’s not the case and big money is changing hands.</p>
<p><strong>State of economy under National</strong></p>
<p>The government trumpets how wonderful our economy is; how thousands of New Zealanders are returning here from Australia.</p>
<p>Astute economists have looked past the smoke and mirrors – as New Zealand First has done.</p>
<p>In the year ended March 2017 the balance of payments deficit was $8 billion and there is no prospect in sight of achieving balance.</p>
<p>Every year we are just falling deeper into debt to the rest of the world – a debt that now stands at $155 billion.</p>
<p>Here is a recent Business Herald article of just over a month ago setting out “Kiwis drowning in debt”.</p>
<p>Our GDP growth of around 3 percent is propped up by rampant immigration.</p>
<p>Take out 2% annual population growth driven up by immigration and we have pitiful GDP growth of around 1 percent.</p>
<p>We are on shaky ground.</p>
<p>When things break – you know who they will come for:</p>
<p>Seniors.</p>
<p>If they think they’ll be safe, they’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Grey Power and seniors</strong></p>
<p>Only one party will be here to defend seniors.</p>
<p>That party is New Zealand First, the only party which has battled long and hard for NZ Super.</p>
<p>And don’t listen to the supporters of the government when they say NZ Super is unaffordable.</p>
<p>National and their fellow travellers can’t make out the fiscal case for such claims but that never stops them.</p>
<p>New Zealand First can make out the fiscal case for affordability and we have.</p>
<p>We’ll restore government contributions to the Cullen Fund.</p>
<p>Both National and Labour agree to taxing the Super Fund. We don’t.</p>
<p>We’re opposed to that - because the fund is built on taxes in the first place.</p>
<p>We believe in looking after our seniors – because they have earned that right through a lifetime of paying taxes.</p>
<p><strong>Student loans</strong></p>
<p>We believe in looking after young New Zealanders also.</p>
<p>We will get rid of student loans for New Zealand students who stay and work here after they graduate.</p>
<p>The only requirement is they work for the same number of years as they have studied.</p>
<p>A student who completes a three-year degree will only need to work for three years in New Zealand, or a five year degree will require five years’ work here.</p>
<p>But if they leave for a big OE, and decide to work overseas, students will have to pay back some of the cost of their tertiary education.</p>
<p>Where students have a current student debt then the system changes to our dollar for dollar policy.</p>
<p>We will also introduce a universal student allowance.</p>
<p>These are our practical solutions to the huge debt students have to grapple with.</p>
<p>We understand young New Zealanders are labouring under debts that are proving too burdensome.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In just over five weeks’ time the people of Christchurch and Canterbury, and the people of New Zealand, have the chance of transitioning to a better future.</p>
<p>New Zealand First has a vision for a better New Zealand with jobs and decent healthcare, a more prosperous New Zealand, a safer New Zealand, a fairer New Zealand.</p>
<p>We ask you to join us in this transition.</p>
<p>New Zealand First has the policies, and the candidates.</p>
<p>Don’t squander the opportunity.</p>
<p>Seize it.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
