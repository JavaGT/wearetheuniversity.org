<p>LawTech Bootcamp aims to break new ground</p>
<p>University of Canterbury’s brightest Law, Commerce and information technology students will have the opportunity to team up with a top New Zealand law firm’s business experts during the groundbreaking LawTech Bootcamp.</p>
<p>This weekend, 11 - 13 August, more than 40 undergraduate and postgraduate students from a range of disciplines will join legal experts at Lane Neave to create technology-based solutions to modern challenges in the legal sector.</p>
<p>The teams of students will be paired with legal and business mentors for “speed mentoring sessions” to provide feedback and guidance as the teams shape their initial ideas over the weekend to be in with the chance to win the $3000 prize.</p>
<p>“The legal sector has not always been the fastest industry to embrace rapid changes in technology and Lane Neave is keen to explore the latest innovations, for our business and the wider sector,” says Lane Neave chief executive officer Peter Dwan.</p>
<p>“It is now more important than ever for law firms to meet the market through the smart use of technology.”</p>
<p>“During this LawTech Bootcamp, our firm wants to uncover what the brightest sparks in IT Technology and Commerce can add to our company’s specific expertise and create some exciting new ideas and solutions.”</p>
<p>Michelle Panzer, the Incubator Manager of the University of Canterbury’s Centre for Entrepreneurship, says that the LawTech Bootcamp provides a fantastic opportunity for the students to work with experienced professionals and their clients, as well as specialists in other fields.</p>
<p>“These students get to combine their innovative, problem-solving mindsets to tackle very real and relevant challenges. Being able to do that alongside a high-profile business raises the bar that much more,” says Ms Panzer.</p>
<p>“The prospect of providing tangible and valuable solutions that realise the potential that technology can have to efficiently deliver legal services and improve the customer experience for clients is incredibly exciting for our students.”</p>
<p>Mr Dwan says that the opportunity to partner with the University of Canterbury’s Centre for Entrepreneurship was a great platform to share ideas between the academic and corporate world and feed off each other’s expertise.</p>
<p>“We will provide a framework of some current issues that the teams may want to look at, but because this has never been done before, we can only guess where the Bootcamp will end up.”</p>
