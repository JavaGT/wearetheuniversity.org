<p><strong>Friday, 11 August 2017, 1:58 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Winston Peters<br>New Zealand First Leader<br>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>11 AUGUST 2017  </p>
<p><strong>Nz First’s Student Driving Policy a Winner</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is pleased its driver training education for the young policy has now been endorsed by research from Massey <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/ED1708/S00035/school-driving-lessons-benefit-students-in-many-ways.htm">University</a>, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“The university says such a programme provides enormous benefits for students and their families.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First, like Massey University, realised the difficulty of obtaining a driver’s licence has been a major stumbling block for tens of thousands of young New Zealanders getting jobs and getting ahead in their lives.</p>
<p>“Statistics show also that many prisoners start their path to prison by committing a simple traffic offence.</p>
<p>“To address this problem we announced our policy in September last year and our political rivals took note, realising it has great value.</p>
<p>“The Maori Party went so far as to copy our policy but preferred to indulge in separatism by giving preferential treatment for Maori.</p>
<p>“Such a blinkered approach is totally out of order in modern day New Zealand.</p>
<p>“All young people, regardless of their ethnic background, should have the chance of getting a driver’s licence.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First’s policy will make that possible,” says Mr Peters.</p>
