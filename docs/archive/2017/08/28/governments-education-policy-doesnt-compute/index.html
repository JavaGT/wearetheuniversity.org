<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>28 August 2017<br>Government’s education policy doesn’t compute</p>
<p>National says their latest $160m commitment over four years for a second language at primary schools will ‘ensure all children have the opportunity to learn a second language at primary school, if they choose to.’ But the figures don’t add up, says Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins.</p>
<p>“Such a policy would require a language teacher in every primary school, or at least the equivalent resourcing across the country. Assuming a salary of $60,000 and not accounting for any overheads or training, it would cost $117m per year to ensure every primary school had a fully qualified language teacher.</p>
<p>“Even if National put language assistants in every school, rather than fully qualified and registered teachers, the policy would still cost more than $100m per year.</p>
<p>“So why has National only costed the policy at $40m per year?</p>
<p>“The numbers just don’t add up, and National has yet to provide any details or factsheet for their policy beyond a single press release.</p>
<p>“Not only that, there appears to be major ambiguity as to whether schools will even be required to offer a language.</p>
<p>“Nikki Kaye said in her press release that schools ‘will be required to offer at least one second language to their students’.</p>
<p>“Yet at a press conference after his announcement, Bill English was asked whether a school could opt not to offer their students any language even if those students wanted to learn one and he said ‘well that could happen.’</p>

<p>“Is National costing the uptake of this policy at just a third of schools? If so, why wasn’t Bill English upfront about that yesterday?</p>
<p>“Labour will invest an additional $4 billion over four years to deliver a modern education system by cancelling National’s poorly targeted tax cuts.</p>
<p>“Labour’s commitments for education will ensure our kids get the best start in life and relieve the growing financial pressure on parents. They’re also fully costed.” says Chris Hipkins.</p>
