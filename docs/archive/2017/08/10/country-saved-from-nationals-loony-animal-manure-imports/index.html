<p>Winston Peters</p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>10 AUGUST 2017  </p>
<p>Country Saved From National’s Loony Animal Manure Imports</p>
<p>New Zealand First says the Minister for Primary Industries Nathan Guy has serious explaining to do, given a second embarrassing biosecurity climb down within a week.</p>
<p>“Thank goodness, and farmers the length and breadth of New Zealand can breathe a deep sigh of relief,” says the Rt Hon Winston Peters, Leader of New Zealand First and Member of Parliament for Northland.</p>
<p>“New Zealand will no longer be importing the excrement of European cattle, horses and chickens. Yet taxpayers have spent tens of thousands of dollars developing an ‘Import Health Standard’ for farm animal dung.</p>
<p>“If there was ever a policy metaphor for a Minister’s ability this surely is it.</p>
<p>“It ranks right up there with Korean Mud, which was only cancelled this week at the 11th hour and 59th minute. Both raised the spectre of introducing diseases not present here including Foot &amp; Mouth Disease.</p>
<p>“It continues to raise serious questions of Biosecurity NZ and the inactions of this stubborn Minister. This is why we wrote to the Audit Office and they need to continue their examination because there’s been seriously worrying lapses.</p>
<p>“This was never about the free market as Mr Guy held but the lunatic market,” says Mr Peters.</p>
