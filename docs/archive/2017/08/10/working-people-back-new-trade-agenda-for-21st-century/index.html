<p><strong>Thursday, 10 August 2017, 10:20 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions">New Zealand Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p>Working people back “A New Trade Agenda for the 21st Century”</p>
<p>The Council of Trade Unions (CTU), speaking on behalf of working New Zealanders, is putting its weight behind efforts to oppose resurrecting the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA).</p>
<p>“This week It’s Our Future, the movement advocating for people-focused trade policy, is launching its ten bottom lines for New Zealand’s future trade policy. We’re proud to support trade which is centred around people,” said CTU Secretary Sam Huggard.</p>
<p>Although President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the 12-country trade agreement in 2016, New Zealand ratified the agreement and Prime Minister Bill English has signalled the government hopes to proceed with or without the US.</p>
<p>“As it stands, the TPPA is a zombie agreement. In February 2016 thousands of New Zealanders marched against it. People have shown they don’t want it and we oppose efforts to resurrect it in its current form.”</p>
<p>“Trade policy must put people first. That means having open negotiations, protecting our ability to set social and environmental policy and respecting the Treaty of Waitangi,” said Huggard.</p>
<p>To mark the launch of the campaign, It’s Our Future and the CTU are co-hosting a panel discussion of trade representatives from the Labour, Green, New Zealand First and Māori parties on the topic of “The need for a new trade agenda for the 21st century”.</p>
<p>Huggard and Professor Jane Kelsey will also speak about the state of New Zealand’s current trade negotiations.</p>
<p>When: 10 August, 6.00pm – 8.00pm</p>
<p>Where: Member’s Dining Room, Parliament Buildings</p>
<p>What: Political panel discussion; Campaign launch – “Trade Policy for the People: 10 bottom lines for New Zealand’s future trade policy</p>
<p>Who: It’s Our Future, Council of Trade Unions (event hosts); David Parker, Marama Fox, Barry Coates, Fletcher Tabuteau (panellists)</p>
