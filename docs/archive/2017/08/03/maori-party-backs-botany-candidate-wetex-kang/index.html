<p><strong>Thursday, 3 August 2017, 9:18 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party">The Maori Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Rahui Papa supports our Asian cousins</p>
<p>Rahui Papa - A representative of the maori kingitanga</p>
<p>Wetex Kang - Botany candidate for the Maori Party</p>
<p>Last month the Maori Party announced their first ever Asian Candidate to stand for the Party.</p>
<p>Party President Tuku Morgan said, “We share whakapapa [genealogies] with our relatives from Asia”. Some studies have indicated that modern day Taiwanese share DNA with Maori and Pacifica peoples.</p>
<p>Mr Morgan announced the candidacy of Wetex Kang, a NZ entrepreneur of Asian descent, to stand in the Botany General Electorate. Wetex can speak a number of Chinese dialects and can also understand Malay.</p>
<p>Rahui Papa, a Kingitanga spokesman and Maori Party candidate for the Hauraki-Waikato seat, remembers a tongikura [tribal saying] by the second Maori King – Tawhiao when he said ‘my friends will come from the four corners of the globe’ and that Tawhiao would ‘befriend all ethnicities’.</p>
<p>The Kingitanga has hosted and has been hosted by many Asian delegations both in Aotearoa and in their countries.</p>
<p>We have struck up a close and warm relationship with the Asian community, especially those who took up residence in Pukekohe, amongst other areas, in the early 1900’s. Since then Aotearoa – NZ has grown into a multicultural and ethnic diverse nation. The duty of manaakitanga [hospitality] is a core value for the Kingitanga and the Asian Community in turn respect the Tangata Whenua or indigenous people of Aotearoa.</p>
<p>“We are aligned in our cultural values, our vowel pronunciation is very similar”. After the recent Dragon – Taniwha Conference hosted by Ngaati Kahungunu, even the aspirations for commercial development are aligned.</p>
<p>“I welcome Wetex as the Maaori Party Candidate for Botany” I wish him well as he campaigns to further all communities of Aotearoa within the values and aspirations of the Maaori Party.</p>
<p>Ka toro atu ngaa ringa ki waho o te moana, hei piriti mai moo te aroha.<br>I reach my hands out across the ocean, a bridge for compassion and respect.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
