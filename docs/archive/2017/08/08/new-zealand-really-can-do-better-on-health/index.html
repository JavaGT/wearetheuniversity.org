<p><strong>Tuesday, 8 August 2017, 4:17 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>New Zealand really can do better on health</p>
<p>Labour’s commitment to affordable access to high quality healthcare will provide a better service for New Zealanders than the current Health Minister, who will not apologise for statements that he made that wrongly criticised hard-working staff in the Southern DHB’s Dunedin Hospital site, says Labour’s Health spokesperson David Clark.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s exchange in Parliament showed how out of touch the Minister really is, revealing he was unfamiliar with statements in a letter about orthopaedic shortfalls sent directly to him by concerned clinicians.</p>
<p>“The contents of the letter were discussed on Radio NZ&#39;s Checkpoint programme yesterday and covered in today&#39;s Otago Daily Times, amid concern about a growing crisis of care at Southern DHB.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister was also unaware of the fact that surgeons had been purchasing non-approved devices at hardware stores for medical care in order to save money in the cash-strapped DHB.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister also failed to rule out financial penalties for Southern DHB, despite having admitted it has a shortfall of Intensive Care Unit beds, which limits its ability to meet elective targets.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister&#39;s disregard for the Health sector is infamous, and today&#39;s admission that he has not seen even a draft of an anticipated report on Southern&#39;s urology services, which was circulated, reinforces his disinterest in the midst of a crisis – the development of which his government has overseen.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government appointed a Crown Monitor to the DHB in 2010 but has been content to observe managed decline since. Seven years on Southerners deserve so much better.</p>
<p>“Only Labour will deliver the affordable access to quality healthcare Otago and Southland expects,” says David Clark.</p>
