<p><strong>John Waller Memorial Scholarships announced by BNZ and PwC</strong></p>
<p>BNZ and PwC New Zealand are pleased to announce a new scholarship programme established at the University of Canterbury to honour former BNZ Board Chairman and respected PwC Managing Partner John Waller, ONZM, FCA.</p>
<p>For five years from 2018, BNZ and PwC will fund three competitive scholarships per year to school leavers choosing to study Commerce, Science or Law at the University of Canterbury.</p>
<p>The John Waller Memorial Scholarships provide $18,000 to each student, as well as summer internships at BNZ and PwC, and mentoring from BNZ and PwC staff.</p>
<p>“We are really pleased to honour John’s values and professional legacy through a scholarship programme which recognises the significant contribution John made to New Zealand business,” BNZ Chief Executive Anthony Healy says.</p>
<p>“John’s outstanding career was characterised by the exercise of a brilliant mind, achievement and influence and he was passionate about helping young people to succeed,” he says.</p>
<p>“John recalled his studies for a Bachelor of Commerce at the University of Canterbury as a stepping stone for his success and this scholarship programme is an appropriate memorial,” Mr Healy says.</p>
<p>PwC CEO Mark Averill says: “John always had time to help people – he always wanted to give something back. I can&#39;t think of a better way to honour his memory and legacy than through this scholarship programme.</p>
<p>“John was a highly recognised and well respected leader – both amongst his peers and across the business community.</p>
<p>“He was a hard worker who led from the front and combined an excellent commercial acumen with a pragmatic approach. John&#39;s positive outlook, his courage to tackle challenges head on and make the tough calls was truly inspirational.</p>
<p>“These are just some of the values and attributes we hope to encourage with these scholarships,” says Mr Averill.</p>
<p>University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr has expressed his gratitude for the generosity of those behind the new scholarship programme.</p>
<p>“We are delighted that the John Waller Memorial Scholarships will make it possible for so many outstanding Canterbury students to pursue their degrees in Commerce, Science or Law, while also getting a headstart with BNZ and PwC internships and mentoring,” Dr Carr says.</p>
<p>“It is our goal that UC students are prepared to make a difference in the world, with real-life experience, internships and placements built in to the majority of our bachelor degree programmes. Of those who completed their bachelor’s degrees in 2016, 64% engaged in employment, internship, practical work-related experience, or entrepreneurship as part of their studies at UC.</p>
<p>“As well as standing as a wonderful tribute to John Waller’s values, this far-sighted scholarship programme will add to this ethos, while passing on his legacy to future leaders,” he says.</p>
