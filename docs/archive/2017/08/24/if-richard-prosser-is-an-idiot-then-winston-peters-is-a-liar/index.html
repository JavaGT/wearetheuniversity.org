<p><strong>Thursday, 24 August 2017, 8:27 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>If Richard Prosser is a F***ing Idiot then Winston Peters is a F***ing Liar</p>
<p>ACT has <a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=16452&qid=4472069">made Winston Peters back down</a> on New Zealand First’s plans to confiscate New Zealanders&#39; investments in the sharemarket and Kiwisaver, ACT Leader David Seymour says. But Peters lied about his party’s policies as he wriggled off the hook.</p>
<p>&quot;Richard Prosser warned shareholders in energy companies to sell their shares now before New Zealand First compulsorily acquired them for a massively discounted rate in a confiscation of private property. New Zealand First’s nationalization policy would hit millions of New Zealanders with Kiwisaver as well as hundreds of thousands who own shares.&quot;</p>
<p>Winston Peters incredibly described Prosser’s threat as a &#39;throwaway&#39; line.</p>
<p>&quot;At best, Peters doesn&#39;t know his own policy. More likely, he&#39;s a liar. What his MP said was not a throwaway line, it&#39;s the top line of <a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=16453&qid=4472069">their policy on state owned enterprises</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand First’s policy is to buy back energy companies at the price they were originally sold, or less, confiscating the savings of the many thousands who have invested in shares, and hundreds of thousands more with KiwiSaver.</p>
<p>“Winston Peters can&#39;t be trusted. If he was honest he&#39;d come clean about what else he plans to in government. National and Labour need to reject Peters&#39; insane ideas, because we know now that he backs down when his 1950s throwback policies are called out.&quot;</p>
