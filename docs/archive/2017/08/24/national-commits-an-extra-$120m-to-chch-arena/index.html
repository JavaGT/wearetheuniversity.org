<p><strong>Thursday, 24 August 2017, 1:09 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hon Nicky Wagner</strong><br>National Party Spokesperson for Greater Christchurch Regeneration</p>
<p><strong>National commits an extra $120m to Chch arena</strong></p>
<p>A new National government will contribute an extra $120 million toward the construction of a Multi-Use Arena in Christchurch, taking the Government’s total contribution to $179 million, Greater Christchurch Regeneration spokesperson Nicky Wagner says.</p>
<p>“A new stadium will provide Canterbury with a flexible venue that will attract a wide range of sports, entertainment and hosting events to the city and increase the number of visitors to the region,” Ms Wagner says.</p>
<p>“Our preference is for a 30,000 capacity arena with a fully closed roof – however the configuration is ultimately up to the community and Christchurch City Council.</p>
<p>“The $120 million investment is on top of the Government’s $59 million commitment for land acquisition, demolition and business cases, bringing the total contribution to $179 million.”</p>
<p>Ms Wagner says National’s funding commitment gives Christchurch the assurance it needs to make an informed decision on the best option, and will enable work to start next year.</p>
<p>“This isn’t just any other stadium, it’s a central hub that will be designed to bring together the community and invigorate wider Canterbury. The multi-purpose concept is critical because it will ensure the facility is well used and cost effective, with broader opportunities for events,” Ms Wagner says.</p>
<p>“The Multi-Use Arena is the final anchor project to get underway and National is committed to getting it done.</p>

<p>“When combined with funding the Council has set aside thorough the cost sharing agreement, today’s announcement means there is already sufficient funding committed for a 30,000 capacity stadium with an open roof. The Christchurch community may need to source further funding if they choose a more expensive option.</p>
<p>“This $179 million dollar contribution builds on the National Government’s $17b commitment to the rebuild.</p>
<p>“This year alone we opened three new schools, completed the $2.2 billion horizontal infrastructure repair programme, unveiled the Canterbury Earthquake National Memorial, announced a contract to complete the design and construction of the Convention Centre, and put forward a strong offer to support the reinstatement of ChristChurch Cathedral.</p>
<p>“Christchurch continues to go from strength to strength, with strong job growth, more visitors returning and the regeneration of the city well underway.</p>
<p>“National remains committed to helping the city back on its feet.”</p>
