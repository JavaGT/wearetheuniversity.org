<p>Greens celebrate passage of Healthy Homes Bill</p>
<p>The Green Party is today celebrating the passing of the Healthy Homes Guarantee Bill, which works towards ensuring that no New Zealanders get sick from the house they live in.</p>
<p>“The passing of this legislation will make a huge difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of New Zealand families,” said Green Party housing spokesperson Marama Davidson.</p>
<p>“The Healthy Homes Guarantee Bill will significantly improve the quality of rental accommodation, lifting children out of poverty and helping to reduce deaths from preventable diseases.</p>
<p>“I congratulate Minister Twyford for ensuring the passage of this legislation so early on in the term of the new Government.</p>
<p>“National had nine years to improve situations for tenants, but under their watch things only got worse.</p>
<p>“We are proud to have put minimum housing standards and renters’ rights on the political agenda.</p>
<p>“My colleague Gareth Hughes brought the first rental warrant of fitness bill to Parliament in 2010, and National voted down a similar bill in the name of Metiria Turei in 2016.</p>
<p>“We will continue to push for everyone to have a warm, dry and affordable home to call their own and today marks a significant step in achieving that,” said Ms Davidson.</p>
