<p><strong>US Historian Commemorates Memory, Images of WWI</strong></p>
<p>What people see matters more than what they read, according to renowned United States World War One historian, Professor Jay Winter, in regard to war images and accounts.</p>
<p>The Yale University, Charles J. Stille Professor of History, is giving three public lectures this week – two in Palmerston North and one at Te Papa in Wellington – as part of the Centenary History of New Zealand and First World War project Massey University is part of.</p>
<p>In his first lecture, The Geometry of Memory, Professor Winter addresses the spatial logic of war memorials and the geometry applied to places of remembrance. He gives this lecture at Palmerston North Central Library at 5.30pm on Thursday, 23 November.</p>
<p>In the second lecture, <em>The Centenary Commemoration</em>, Professor Winter explores the impact of World War One on the 20th century, and the commemoration of the war. The lecture is on Friday at 1pm, also in the Palmerston North Central Library.</p>
<p>In his third lecture, <em>Photographing the Great War,</em> at Te Papa on Saturday, 25 November, he explores the impact of the “Kodak revolution” of World War One and the extensive trail of unofficial footage that ensued. Throughout the war, soldiers photographed their experiences, capturing moments of boredom, combat, or reflection. This left an important collection of photographs that are now resurfacing from family photo albums to the public domain.</p>
<p>Massey war historian and prolific author Professor Glyn Harper says Professor Winter is “without doubt the foremost world expert on war, memory and commemoration and we are really fortunate to have him here in New Zealand at this time.”</p>
