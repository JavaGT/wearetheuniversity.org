<p><strong>NZUSA elects 2018 student leaders</strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) has elected the student representatives who will lead the movement in 2018.

<p>‘We have an enormous opportunity next year to build on our successes and to be an influential voice for students with the new government and the tertiary sector. I’m looking forward to leading a strong team to deliver wins for students in 2018,’ says Jonathan Gee.</p>
<p>Jonathan, 23, is a public policy and political science graduate from Victoria University of Wellington. Prior to serving as National President this year, he was President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA).</p>

<p>‘I believe that there is space for all voices to be valued and taken seriously, which is why I’m excited about my new role leading Tertiary Women New Zealand,’ says Nikita Skipper.</p>
<p>Nikita, 20, is studying a business and politics conjoint at Massey University. She has just completed her second term as President of Massey University Students’ Association (MUSA), the association for Massey’s Manawatu campus students.</p>
