<p><strong>Government needs to put a ceiling on debt</strong></p>
<p>The new Coalition Government needs to rapidly put a ceiling on the debt levels it’s prepared to tolerate as it opens wide the taxpayers chequebook, National Party Finance Spokesperson Steven Joyce says.</p>
<p>“The admissions in Parliament today from Grant Robertson that he may allow debt to grow by more than $11 billion compared to the figures in the Government’s Pre-Election Fiscal Update will be concerning to all Kiwis,” Mr Joyce says.</p>
<p>“When I invited him to re-commit to his pre-election promise of limiting debt to no more than $67.6 billion, he refused.</p>
<p>“So what is Mr Robertson’s upper limit? Is it $70 billion or $75 billion? The major bank economists certainly believe it will be higher than he thinks.</p>
<p>“Remember net government debt was on track to reduce to $56 billion only two months ago.</p>
<p>“Mr Robertson’s admission follows hard on the heels of three bank reports that say the Government’s spending plans are unrealistic and ‘too tight to be credible’.</p>
<p>“The ANZ even says there will be no way the Government is able to meet its own Budget Responsibility Rule on debt.</p>
<p>“Mr Robertson needs to haul himself into line along with the rest of the Cabinet so that the increased debt predictions of the major trading banks don’t come to pass.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders have all worked hard to get the Government books back into surplus and start reducing the debt built up as a result of the Global Financial Crisis and the Canterbury earthquakes.</p>
<p>“The public will be surprised at how quickly Mr Robertson is backing away from his own numbers when he’s only been in the job three weeks.”</p>
