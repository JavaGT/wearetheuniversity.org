<p>Summer is almost here and with it comes a provocative and comprehensive display of contemporary art at the annual Elam Artists Graduate Show.  </p>
<p>Established in 1889, Elam has a reputation as New Zealand’s foremost art school and every year thousands of art lovers, curators, dealers, and collectors flock to the University of Auckland to enjoy the weekend-long event.</p>
<p>The 2017 show has extended its format to include four open days, film screenings and performance. The exhibition features a diverse range of artworks including painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, installation, moving image, and new media, created by more than a hundred BFA, BFA (Hons), PGDipFA and MFA graduating students.</p>
<p>One performance <em>Eat My Rice</em>, will feature Filipino artist Louis Bretana creating an inter-cultural experience through food and conversation.  </p>
<p>“I recommend you put aside a generous amount of time to experience the rich variety of artwork on show,” says Elam Head of School, Associate Professor Peter Shand. “Many of our graduates become prominent artists. Their success demonstrates both their talent and the exceptional teaching at our school,” he says.</p>
<p>Last year’s Graduate Show marked the launch of an online resource called Elam Artists that records graduates’ achievements and provides a permanent, searchable alumni archive. The 2017 Elam graduates will feature on the site from 1 December.  </p>
<p>“Elam Artists is an invaluable resource that showcases our artists to the world,&quot; says Associate Professor Shand. “Each year as the archive continues to grow, it will document the talent that originates from the country’s leading art school,” he says.</p>
<p>The Elam Artists Graduate Show takes place from Thursday 30 November until Sunday 3 December, Elam School of Fine Arts, the University of Auckland.</p>
