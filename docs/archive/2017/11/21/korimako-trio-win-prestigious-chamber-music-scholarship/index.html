<p>A talented trio from the School of Music at the University of Auckland have won the 2017 Pettman ROSL (Royal Over-Seas League) Arts Chamber Music Scholarship.</p>
<p>Students Modi Deng (piano), Diane Huh (Violin) and Tahee Kim (cello), members of the Korimako Trio were named the winners beating ten other ensembles in the finals, held in Christchurch during the weekend.</p>
<p>They were chosen by an adjudicating panel consisting of Geoff Parkin, Director of Arts ROSL; Ferio Saxophone Quartet:  Huw Wiggin, Eleanor McMurray, Jose Banuls Marcos and Shevaughan Beere; Professor Peter Walls ONZM CEO, Chamber Music New Zealand; Tony Chen Lin, pianist; and Serenity Thurlow, Principal Viola Christchurch Symphony Orchestra.</p>
<p>The adjudicators said, ‘the trio showed clear musical vision and a strong ensemble in both rounds of the competition. Individually and together they are at an ideal point in their development to take full advantage of the intensive performance and coaching opportunities which the scholarship offers.&#39;</p>
<p>The trio were finalists in the Auckland Chamber Music Society competition and the Pettman/ROSL Chamber Music Scholarship in 2016. They were mentored this year by Senior Lecturer Edith Salzmann, Associate Professor Rae de Lisle and Professional Teaching Fellow Stephen Larsen, and have also received coaching from Professional Teaching Fellow David Guerin, Senior Lecturer Stephen de Pledge, Caroline Almonte and Ekaterina Derzhavina.</p>
<p>The Korimako Trio draws their name from a Maori saying that likens fluent, graceful orators and singers to a bellbird singing at dawn, <em>He rite ki te kōpara e kō nei I te ata</em>.</p>
<p>Now in its twelfth year, the Scholarship, worth $50,000 provides the winners with a five-week cultural experience in the United Kingdom, including master classes, summer schools, performing at the ROSL Clubhouse in London and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and the opportunity to attend concerts and operas.  </p>
