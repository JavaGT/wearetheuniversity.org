<p>02 November 2017</p>
<p>The University of Auckland is celebrating the success of 31 of its researchers and research groups whose projects have won $19.8 million in the Marsden Fund round.</p>
<p>Research at the University supported by the fund will address diverse topics including the origins of early life on earth; defending blood flow to the ‘selfish’ brain; a Māori archaeology of threatened rock art; building an ‘atlas’ of the human gut; and the impact of marketing ‘health’ to children.</p>
<p>“These awards recognise the high calibre of researchers at the University of Auckland as well as the quality and breadth of our research,” says Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research), Professor Jim Metson.</p>
<p>“The Marsden Fund supports the cutting-edge of new research which will lead to discoveries that shape our future. We congratulate our researchers for this recognition of their outstanding work.”</p>
<p>Thirteen research projects from the Faculty of Science received a total of $8.8 million. Among these, Professor Kathleen Campbell will carry out research to find early life in terrestrial hot springs.</p>
<p>Seven projects from the Faculty of Arts were awarded a total of $4.6 million. These include Dr Alice Mills who will study the role of stable housing in reducing re-offending by ex-prisoners. Dr Avril Bell will pursue research titled ‘Tāngata Tiriti: Learning the trick of standing upright here’.</p>
<p>Grants of $3 million were awarded to four research projects from the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, including Dr Fiona McBryde who will investigate a pioneering technique measuring the dynamic relationship between blood pressure, sympathetic nerve activity and brain blood flow.</p>
<p>Grants worth a total of $1.5 million were awarded to three projects from the Faculty of Engineering, including for Dr Lihua Tang, for research into self-adaptive technologies to harvest electricity from environmental vibrations. Dr Xuyun Zhang will study versatile and efficient anomaly detection for fog computing applications.</p>
<p>The Auckland Bioengineering Institute was awarded two grants totalling $1.25 million, including for research by Associate Professor Leo Cheng titled: ‘An atlas of the gut: a framework for integrating structure to function’.</p>
<p>The Faculty of Education and Social Work and the James Henare Research Centre each won a grant of $300,000.</p>
<p>Applications to the Marsden Fund are highly competitive. This year the fund distributed $84.6 million to 133 research projects around the country.</p>
<p>Successful projects from the University of Auckland are:
