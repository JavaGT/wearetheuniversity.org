<p><strong>Fact check: Student Allowance increase is not a rort</strong></p>
<p>The National Party’s claims that the Student Allowance increase will be easy money for the unemployed are incorrect, says the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).</p>
<p>Responding to news first published in the <a href="http://www.students.org.nz/r?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nzherald.co.nz%2Fnz%2Fnews%2Farticle.cfm%3Fc_id%3D1%26objectid%3D11947890&e=4236cfde8d142a4e913140d100895c4855638393&utm_source=students&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=factcheck1&n=1">NZ Herald</a> today, National President Jonathan Gee says: ‘Simply comparing the Student Allowance figure with Jobseeker Support does not show the whole picture.’</p>
<p>The claims do not take into account the Accommodation Supplement of up to $130 per week. The Supplement is accessible to most beneficiaries, except students, who need accommodation support on top of their current benefit.</p>
<p>Instead, students can access the Accommodation Benefit of up to $40 to top up their Allowance, a stark contrast to the $130 for non-students.</p>
<p>‘In fact, students who have been on other benefits have told us that going into tertiary study has been a big financial sacrifice for them and their families.’</p>
<p>Gee also dismissed claims that suggested the previous Government aimed to give the same money to students as well as other beneficiaries.</p>
<p>‘While the previous Government claimed they pegged the Student Allowance to the Jobseeker benefit, they pledged greater increases to the Accommodation Supplement compared with the Accommodation Benefit for students.’</p>

<p>In the previous Government’s Budget 2017 they announced an increase in the students’ Accommodation Benefit of up to $20 (making it a maximum of $60 from April 2018). The Accommodation Supplement increased by an average of $36 (making it a maximum of $165 from April 2018).</p>
<p>‘From 2018 students will still be up to $100 worse off than beneficiaries with respect to accommodation support.’</p>
<p>‘Let’s see the $50 increase in student support for what it is - an increase to meet basic needs. Any suggestion that it will create a rort is totally refutable.’</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
