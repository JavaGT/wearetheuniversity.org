<p>New senior appointments at Lincoln University</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Robin Pollard welcomed senior appointments made this week at Lincoln University. He commented that considerable thought had been given to the positions and appointments, including discussion at staff fora, with Council members, and with other stakeholders.</p>
<p>&quot;We needed to rebuild the senior management team, and that involved taking into account existing capabilities, preserving some organisational memory, and encouraging fresh approaches&quot;, Professor Pollard said. &quot;The senior roles have been designed and filled to ensure that our community of scholars will flourish.&quot;</p>
<p>Three roles have not been filled in this round: Chief Commercial Officer, Director, Kaiārahi Māori, and Director, Research Management.</p>
<p>The new appointments are:</p>
<p>Chief Academic Officer – Professor Bruce McKenzie BS (Penn State), PhD (Cant), DipAgrSc (Cant)  </p>
