<p>Partnership to strengthen legal research in New Zealand</p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington’s Faculty of Law and Thomson Reuters have announced a new partnership to support and promote the Faculty’s leading legal research.</p>
<p>The partnership will support authors from the Faculty of Law who are contributing to the A to Z of New Zealand Law—a comprehensive series of topic-based texts by New Zealand’s leading legal minds.</p>
<p>Building upon the well-established research scholarship programme developed a number of years ago by Victoria University’s Scholarship office, Thomson Reuters will, for two years, part-fund scholarships for students to provide research assistance to those authors.</p>
<p>Victoria’s Faculty of Law is the number one ranked law school in the country for research quality, in the most recent PBRF (Performance Based Research Fund) evaluation.</p>
<p>Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Law Professor Mark Hickford says the partnership will leverage the Faculty’s powerful culture of research to help provide timely, accessible research for academic and professional audiences.</p>
<p>“The mutually reliant nature of legal research and publishing means that the more closely we can work together, the more efficient the process and outcomes for both.</p>
<p>“We continue to meet rapidly evolving needs—both in terms of supporting theoretical legal research, and in the provision of practical teaching and reference resources for the profession.”</p>
<p>Ian McIntosh, Thomson Reuter’s Commercial Manager—Product Development, says the innovative partnership with Victoria’s Faculty of Law is the first of its kind for Thomson Reuters New Zealand.</p>

<p>“We see it as a true collaboration designed to produce mutually beneficial outcomes both now and in the future for Victoria’s Faculty of Law and Thomson Reuters.”</p>
<p>The first recipients of the new Thomson Reuters Victoria University Legal Research Scholarships are Eru Kapa-King and Kahu Haimona, who will provide assistance to Dr Carwyn Jones in support of Te Ākinga: The Māori Dimension of New Zealand Law; and Katie Alexander, who will assist Dr Grant Morris who is working on Mediation in New Zealand. Both are scheduled to be published this year.</p>
