<p>Costs of education to parents increased by Government freeze on education spending</p>
<p>20 January 2016</p>
<p>Children will be the biggest losers if a Government freeze on education spending this year increases the costs of education to parents, NZEI Te Riu Roa warned today.</p>
<p>New figures released today show parents face $38,000 for the cost of state school education for a child born in 2017, an increase of 15 percent since 2007.</p>
<p>In last year&#39;s Budget, the Government froze 2017 school operational funding and continued a seven year freeze of early childhood education funding.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa President Lynda Stuart said failing to fund education properly was costly to parents, but the biggest losers were children.</p>
<p>&quot;Schools know that parents are strapped for cash, and a survey of principals late last year shows that many schools will instead be forced to cut teacher aide hours because their communities simply can&#39;t afford to pay more. That means the children who most need extra support miss out, and teacher aides face more insecurity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand primary school students are currently funded below the OECD average. The Government&#39;s decision to freeze school funding this year exacerbates the under-funding issue. It&#39;s time the Government prioritised children&#39;s education over promises of tax cuts.&quot;</p>
