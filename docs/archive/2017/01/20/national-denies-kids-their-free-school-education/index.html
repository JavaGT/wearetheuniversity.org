<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>20 January 2017</p>
<p>National denies kids their free school education</p>
<p>The National Government’s ongoing underfunding and recent funding freeze is denying Kiwi kids their right to a free schooling, says Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins.</p>
<p>“By law, schooling in New Zealand is supposed to be free, but under National that’s simply no longer the case.</p>
<p>“Recent research by ASG showing that parents can expect to pay up to $40,000 towards the cost of a child’s schooling is yet more evidence that government underfunding has killed any notion that education in New Zealand is free.</p>
<p>“National’s freeze on school funding has only made this worse. Government funding simply hasn’t been keeping up with the cost of educating kids.</p>
<p>“If they don’t get the money from government, schools have to look elsewhere and parents are the ones most likely to end up footing the bill. It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>“Labour has made a very clear commitment to fund schools properly so they don’t have to rely on contributions from parents. Every Kiwi kid deserves a fair shot at a great education.</p>
<p>“That’s why the law says it should be free, and that’s why Labour will ensure we live up to that promise,” Chris Hipkins says.</p>
