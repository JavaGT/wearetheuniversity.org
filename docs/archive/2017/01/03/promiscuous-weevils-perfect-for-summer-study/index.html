<p>Student Madeleine Thom is thrilled to be spending her summer studying the sexual traits of the “charismatic” giraffe weevil.</p>
<p>She is one of 126 students from the Faculty of Science at the University of Auckland selected to complete a Summer Research Scholarship.</p>
<p>At only 19 years-of-age her study has the potential to add significantly to the knowledge of this little known native insect species, which was once thought to be rare but in fact is commonly found in bush over most of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Specifically she will examine post-copulatory (after-mating) sexual selection in the New Zealand giraffe weevil (Lasiorhynchus barbicornis).</p>
<p>“I was introduced to the weird and wonderful giraffe weevils earlier in the year and thought they would be a really interesting animal to study. They are so charismatic,” says Madeleine, who is completing a Bachelor of Science degree.</p>
<p>“Being a Summer Scholar is an awesome opportunity to grow my scientific knowledge and get a lot of hands-on experience.”</p>
<p>Female giraffe weevils mate with multiple partners in a short time making them an ideal species to study sperm competition.</p>
<p>Madeleine will investigate whether a trade-off takes place between the males’ investment in its sperm, or the distinctive elongated snout where the weevil derives its ‘giraffe’ moniker.</p>
<p>The giraffe weevil can reach 9 cm in length, making them New Zealand’s longest native beetle.</p>
<p>The 100 weevils in her study, 50 female and 50 male, were collected from Matuku Reserve in West Auckland. The larvae tunnel inside dead Karaka trees and can often be found in fallen trees that have come down in storms.</p>
<p>They are transferred to mesh enclosures in a laboratory at the University of Auckland, but Madeleine will keep them in her Albany backyard while the University closes over Christmas.</p>
<p>“I’ll be going away for a few days so I’m lucky my mum has agreed to look after them,” Madeleine says.</p>
<p>Madeleine will be supervised by Dr Chrissie Painting from the School of Biological Sciences, who received a grant from the Hutton Fund for the equipment Madeleine will use to conduct her research.</p>
<p>“This project has the potential to reveal novel insights into mechanisms of post-copulatory sexual selection, and contribute to our understanding of the factors that drive relationships among pre- and post-copulatory sexual traits in nature,” Dr Painting says.</p>
<p>The University of Auckland summer scholarship programme is an opportunity for high achieving students to conduct a research project under supervision, providing exposure to specialist research practices and improving career opportunities.</p>
