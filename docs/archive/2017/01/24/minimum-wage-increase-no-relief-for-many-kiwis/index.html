<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>24 January 2017</p>
<p>Minimum wage increase no relief for many Kiwis</p>
<p>The minimum wage increase announced today will be cold comfort to thousands of New Zealanders struggling to pay their rent or mortgage, says Labour’s Workplace Relations spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway.</p>
<p>“Fifty cents an hour simply is not enough to keep up with the enormous increases in housing costs that many New Zealanders currently face. A 3.3 per cent increase in wages is nothing when rents went up by 5.8 per cent last year and house prices rose by 12.5 per cent.</p>
<p>“The truth is that far too many New Zealanders are on the minimum wage and therefore utterly reliant on the Government to increase their income.</p>
<p>“National has repeatedly stripped away working people’s rights to bargain for decent wages and has failed to make New Zealand economy more productive.</p>
<p>“That’s why wages are so low in New Zealand and why nearly 200,000 working people are at the mercy of the Government setting their wages for them.</p>
<p>“Labour is committed to building a strong, resilient and productive economy and overhauling workplace relations in New Zealand so that all working people get a decent day’s pay for a decent day’s work,” says Iain Lees-Galloway.</p>
