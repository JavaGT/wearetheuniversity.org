<p>One of the world’s leading literary critics and poets Harvard Professor Stephen Burt, who has a particular interest in New Zealand poet James K Baxter, will discuss New Zealand poetry in an event hosted by the University of Canterbury’s English department, next week.</p>
<p>In 2012, <em>The New York Times</em> described Professor Burt “one of the most influential poetry critics of his generation.”</p>
<p>In a free public event chaired by UC English Professor Paul Millar, Prof Burt, who is currently a Visiting Canterbury Fellow, and New Zealand publisher and literary commentator Fergus Barrowman, MNZM, will discuss work by a range of poets from New Zealand and elsewhere. They will look at ways to gain New Zealand poetry a greater international readership and discuss how contemporary poetry travels – or does not travel – between nations and across oceans.</p>
<p>Stephen Burt’s essay collection <em>Close Calls with Nonsense</em> (Graywolf Press, 2009) was a finalist for the prestigious US National Book Critics Circle Award. His other works include <em>The Art of the Sonnet</em> (Harvard University Press, 2010), <em>Parallel Play: Poems</em> (Graywolf, 2006), <em>Randall Jarrell on W. H. Auden</em> (University Press, 2005), <em>Belmont</em> (Graywolf Press, 2013) and <em>The Poem is You</em> (Harvard University Press, 2016).</p>
<p>Burt grew up around Washington, DC and received an AB from Harvard in 1994 and a PhD in English from Yale in 2000. He taught at Macalester College for several years before becoming a Professor of English at Harvard University. He lives in the suburbs of Boston with his spouse, Jessie Bennett, and their two children.</p>
