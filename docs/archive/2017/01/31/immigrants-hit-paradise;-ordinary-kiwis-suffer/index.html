<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters</p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>31 JANUARY 2016  </p>
<p>Immigrants Hit Paradise; Ordinary Kiwis Suffer</p>
<p>Getting homes and jobs has been made even tougher for ordinary Kiwis with a record 70,600 migrants settling permanently in New Zealand last year, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Every month for two and a half years we have set records for the huge numbers of immigrants coming here. Today’s new record is immigration at 127300 for the year to December 2016.</p>
<p>“As this happens the government just sits by and does nothing since rampant immigration drives down wages through job competition and props up artificial consumption</p>
<p>“Even Treasury, MBIE, ANZ and others have warned of the dire consequences but the National Government ignores them.</p>
<p>“At the same time big business interests spew out their propaganda via one of their mouthpieces, NZ Initiative, which lacks any academic credibility.</p>
<p>“Immigration is great for immigrants – they’ve hit paradise compared with what they’ve come from – but the paradise ordinary Kiwis once knew is in decline.</p>
<p>“It’s ordinary Kiwis who are struggling to get a house or a job, or places in hospitals and schools.”</p>
<p>“Clearly the government is not listening to them,” says Mr Peters.</p>
