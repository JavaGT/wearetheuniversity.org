<p>Hutt Youth Backed by Government Funding</p>
<p>Around 1,280 young people in the Hutt Valley will soon be reaping the benefits of more than $307,000 in collaborative youth development funding, announced Hon. Nikki Kaye, Minister for Youth Development, in Lower Hutt today.</p>
<p>&quot;This is huge for young people in the Hutt Valley,” said National List MP based in the Hutt Valley, Chris Bishop. “It’s fantastic to see social investment in action right here in the Hutt.”</p>
<p>The investments are being made under the Partnership Fund which sees the Government co-invest with business, philanthropic, iwi and other partners to grow youth development opportunities.</p>
<p>Ignite Sport, a Hutt Valley-based charity who provide youth development programmes through sport, will be able to provide opportunities for nearly 800 young people at local intermediate and secondary schools.</p>
<p>“I’m delighted to see Ignite Sport recognised in this funding round,” said Mr Bishop. “I’ve been involved with their programmes quite a bit over the past couple of years, and the work they do really makes a difference to kids in the Hutt and beyond.”</p>
<p>“Ignite Sport will be operating in lots of Hutt Valley schools again this year, including Wainuiomata High School, Wainuiomata Intermediate, Hutt Valley High School, Naenae College, Heretaunga College, Maidstone Intermediate, and Upper Hutt College. I’m also really happy to see them offering their programmes in the Teen Parent Unit for the very first time,” said Mr Bishop.</p>

<p>“The Partnership Fund is making significant social investments, and it’s going to have a really positive impact on young people in the Hutt this year,” said Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>In total, around 1,700 young people in the Greater Wellington region will benefit from the collaborative investments in new youth development opportunities totalling over $590,000.</p>
