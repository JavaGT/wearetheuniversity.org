<p><strong>Monday, 23 January 2017, 12:19 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party">The Maori Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Māori Party is looking forward to joining the people of Rātana Pā this week to honour and celebrate a leader who continues to touch the lives of thousands of Māori people.</p>
<p>“Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana was many things – a farmer, a husband, a father, a prophet, a faith healer and a political leader who believed in the benefits of politics and the unification of his people,” said Māori Party co-leader Marama Fox.</p>
<p>“The Māori Party is looking forward to celebrating and honouring him and all that he stood for with the multitudes of his followers at Rātana Pā this week,” said Ms Fox.</p>
<p>&quot;We share many of the same values as Tahupōtiki and his movement when it comes to ensuring the Treaty of Waitangi is upheld and Māori have a voice in Parliament. Both of us also want to support our poorest, sickest and most vulnerable whānau,&quot; said Māori Party co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell.</p>
<p>&quot;We have joined with the Kīngitanga because they share those values too and with all of us at the table, we can advance the health and wellbeing of our people,” said Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>Ms Fox said Tahupōtiki’s work gave thousands of Māori people hope in a desperate and turbulent time.</p>
<p>“The early 1900s was a devastating time for our people as they grappled with land loss, the effects of war, disease, the great depression and the beginning of another war. And in their darkest days, Tahupōtiki gave them hope,” said Ms Fox.</p>
<p>“His followers – the Rātana Movement – continue to unite us and we acknowledge them for opening up their home, year after year, to everyone – religious groups, political parties, those at the coalface of education, of health, of the workforce, members of iwi, hapū and whānau.”</p>

<p>Mr Flavell said the Rātana Movement had to be commended for its work in influencing both past and modern day New Zealand politics and providing a forum for those with influence to report on what they have done and will be doing to better Māori health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>“We can talk politics all week but these celebrations for us in the Māori Party are first and foremost about honouring Tahupōtiki and to be grounded, inspired and reminded of what was important to him – faith, the unity of the Māori people, the voice of the Māori people, the Treaty of Waitangi and the wellbeing of our people,” said Mr Flavell.</p>
