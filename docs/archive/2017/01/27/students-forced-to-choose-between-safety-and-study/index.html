<p>A shortage of Wellington flats are forcing students to choose between safety and study, VUWSA warns.</p>
<p>The annual flat hunt for Wellington tertiary students has started earlier than ever but with growing student numbers and fewer affordable flats on the market students are getting desperate.</p>
<p>VUWSA president Rory Lenihan-Ikin says access to tertiary education is slowly getting closed off to those who can&#39;t afford the cost of living in Wellington.</p>
<p>“The mismatch between the cost of living and student support is beyond a joke. Getting a tertiary education is something increasingly only available for those whose parents can afford to fund them,” he says.</p>
<p>“We’ve had dozens of individual requests for flatting help over the last few weeks, and this is only the tip of iceberg.”</p>
<p>Students are now entering into bidding wars to secure flats, many of which are not in a liveable condition, he says.</p>
<p>“Students are simply desperate to secure something. Landlords and rental agents hold all the power, which is even forcing bidding wars between students.”</p>
<p>Despite the price of rentals going up about 10% in the last year, the quality remains abysmal, Lenihan-Ikin says.</p>
<p>“2017 will be another year of renters getting sick in cold, mouldy flats that they are paying an arm and a leg for, unless action is taking such as the introduction of a rental WOF.”</p>
<p>And on top of increased living costs students are racking up tens of thousands of dollars in student debt, Lenihan-Ikin says.</p>

<p>If students are feeling pressured to sign leases for properties they think are unsafe to live in, we encourage them to come and talk to our advocacy service.</p>
<p>As a way to make the flat-finding process easier and hopefully avoid students being left out in the cold, VUWSA has created a list of five key tips to find and secure a suitable roof over your head.</p>
<p>We also have a guide to flatting which can be found on our website: <a href="http://www.vuwsa.org.nz/flatting-guide/">http://www.vuwsa.org.nz/flatting-guide/</a></p>
