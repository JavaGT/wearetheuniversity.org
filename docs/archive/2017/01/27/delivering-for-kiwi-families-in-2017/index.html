<p><strong>Friday, 27 January 2017, 12:08 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><em>Hon Jo Goodhew<br>MP for Rangitata</em></p>
<p>Delivering for Kiwi families in 2017</p>
<p>As we launch into 2017 and what will be another busy year, we can have confidence New Zealand is on the right track.</p>
<p>We are in capable hands with Bill English and Paula Bennett as leaders, and an energetic team of ministers and MPs behind them.</p>
<p>The Government is gearing up for the challenges of election year with a busy agenda and a clear plan for our country’s future - building on the strong momentum we have achieved over the past eight years.</p>
<p>During the holiday break, I took time out with family and friends and enjoyed a holiday away.</p>
<p>As you will now know that break also gave me time to consider my future and consequently I have this week announced I will not be contesting the election this year.</p>
<p>I have thoroughly enjoyed, in fact loved, my time representing Rangitata as their MP and working as first Junior Whip and then a Minister over a range of portfolios. But after this year’s election I will look for new opportunities.</p>
<p>I remain committed to working as Rangitata MP and will do everything I can to ensure a successful election result in the electorate and nationally for the National Party.</p>
<p>New Zealand in a good space</p>
<p>New Zealand is well positioned compared to most other countries. That’s no accident. It’s the result of New Zealanders’ hard work, backed by the National-led Government’s clear plan for our country’s future.</p>
<p>Our economy remains one of the strongest in the developed world. And Kiwi families are seeing the benefits.</p>

<p>Around 250,000 extra jobs have been created over the past three years and unemployment is falling. The average annual wage is now $58,400 – up $12,000 since we were elected in 2008 and more than double the rate of inflation, while interest rates are at 50-year lows.</p>
<p>The country is back in surplus and we’re getting better results from important public services like hospitals, schools and social programmes.</p>
<p>We are seeing strong growth in sectors such as tourism, ICT, construction, and high-tech manufacturing.</p>
<p>We have the resilience and the financial strength to bounce back from challenges such as the Kaikōura earthquakes, and the Government will continue to support the recovery efforts.</p>
<p>National is committed to ensuring this stability and progress continues as we head into the New Year.</p>
<p>Better connectivity for New Zealanders</p>
<p>High quality internet makes a difference to the way we run our local businesses, with access to the digital economy and greater commercial opportunities, brings huge benefits to our schools and brings convenience and efficiency to our everyday lives.</p>
<p>That is why we are investing $300 million to expand the Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) programme to an additional 151 towns across New Zealand, plus 43 suburban fringe areas around the larger centres which were covered by the first phase of the programme.</p>
<p>In Rangitata this means bringing fibre access to four communities – Methven, Lake Hood, Pleasant Point and Temuka. The expansion means about 8000 more people will have access to fibre.</p>
<p>Phase one of UFB has already brought fibre access to over 1 million households and businesses in 38 towns and cities across New Zealand. The level of UFB uptake is at 30 per cent, with over 300,000 connections.</p>
<p>This expansion brings us closer to achieving our target of bringing faster broadband and better mobile coverage to 99 per cent of New Zealanders by 2025.</p>
<p>Ensuring every child has the opportunity to succeed</p>
<p>As the holiday break comes to an end, another school year begins.</p>
<p>Across the country, we are working hard to ensure all our kids have the opportunity to get a great education that will allow them to fulfill their potential.</p>
<p>Throughout New Zealand, more than 1,503 schools have formed Communities of Learning, around 60 per cent of our nation’s schools.</p>
<p>In the Rangitata Electorate six Communities of Learning cover schools and early children centres including Opuke (Mt Hutt), Hakatere (Ashburton), Geraldine, North Timaru, South Timaru and South Canterbury Catholic.</p>
<p>What this means is more than half a million students are benefiting from shared teaching expertise and resources – with teachers working alongside each other to raise student achievement.</p>
<p>In addition, there are 95 early childhood education and tertiary providers involved.</p>
<p>The Communities of Learning allow better transitions for students from early childhood to school to tertiary, and are funded through the National-led Government’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative.</p>
<p>A Warm Welcome to New Zealand</p>
<p>Sometimes we can become a little complacent about what is around us, it&#39;s true, but having just arrived back from overseas I marvelled at the amazing views I could see right here in my electorate on my early morning walk. I looked out over Caroline Bay to sea and up to the Southern Alps, the mountains that a clear day makes visible to all who drive through the Rangitata electorate.</p>
<p>There are many tourism-based businesses in both Mid and South Canterbury and with tourism now boasting 3 million international visitors, we all want to see our region get the proverbial &#39;share&#39;.</p>
<p>Of course, with added numbers comes pressure on facilities, which is why there is a Regional Mid-sized Tourism Facilities Grant Fund. More than $3 million was granted in round one, with Timaru District Council getting $131,000 and Mackenzie District Council $405,000. Unsurprisingly, toilets for those who pass through tourism hot-spots seem to be high on the list for grants!</p>
<p>Other points:</p>
<p>• Over the last three years the average freedom camper spends $4880 during their visit and those who use other forms of accommodation, $2814.</p>
<p>• Over the past 10 years the number of crashes involving overseas licence-holders has remained relatively constant, during 2011-2015 it has been 6%.</p>
<p>The regions like our own do really well out of international tourists whether they are amongst the 1 million users of the NZ Cycle Trails, staying or visit our DOC walks, huts or campsites or experience other tourist attractions.</p>
<p>I think it’s great that we have a reputation as a nation of warm and friendly people, it was certainly mentioned many times to me on my travels.</p>
<p>Something to be proud of and celebrate.</p>
