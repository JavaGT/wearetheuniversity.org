<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>20 July 2017</p>
<p>New revelations in Joanne Harrison report</p>
<p>The State Services Commission’s report into the treatment of whistle-blowers by Joanne Harrison has revealed new accusations against the convicted fraudster, says Labour MP Sue Moroney.</p>
<p>“The report found that four staff inside the Ministry of Transport who had raised concerns about Harrison’s behaviour suffered disadvantage in processes Harrison was involved in.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that the whistle-blowers were exemplary in their actions to stop Joanne Harrison’s fraud but they were let down by their senior management.</p>
<p>“The report details cases as early as 2013 of whistle-blowers in the finance team raising concerns about Harrison’s invoicing practises.</p>
<p>“It was also the finance team that alerted a senior manager that the Victorian Police Fraud and Extortion Unit was seeking information about Joanne Harrison as a ‘person of interest.’</p>
<p>“A former member of the Ministry’s legal team who was investigating Harrison had her performance pay docked by her.</p>
<p>“Other cases emerged today of people being demoted while on sick leave. Another staff member had a promotion stopped after it had been recommended and their study leave was declined.</p>
<p>“I believe this investigation was long overdue and shows the widespread impact fraudsters can have inside the Public Service and, therefore, the importance of this investigation,” says Sue Moroney.</p>
