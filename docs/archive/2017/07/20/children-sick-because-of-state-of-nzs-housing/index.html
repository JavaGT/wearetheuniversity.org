<p>Children sick because of state of NZ’s housing</p>
<p>Our kids are being repeatedly hospitalised because the Government refuses to take action to ensure our housing stock is up to scratch, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>The Royal Australasian College of Physicians president-elect <a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/335444/damp-homes-adding-to-hospital-backlog-doctor">said today</a> that children with preventable respiratory illnesses are being re-admitted to hospital because they&#39;re being sent back to cold, damp homes.</p>
<p>“While National has stood by as kids continue to pack out hospital waiting rooms, the Greens will introduce a comprehensive Warrant of Fitness for rental homes and boost funding for home insulation,” Green Party health spokesperson Julie Anne Genter said.</p>
<p>“Kids went to hospital <a href="http://www.nzchildren.co.nz/">42,000 times</a> with poverty-related preventable diseases last year. This winter could be even worse.</p>
<p>“Warming up homes is such a simple solution to keep kids healthy, yet National has repeatedly cut funding for home insulation and refused to make landlords comply with reasonable standards in a warrant of fitness.</p>
<p>“We know that our cold, damp and mouldy houses are causing people to get sick and we know that we can fix it.</p>
<p>“This Government has also cut funding for Rheumatic Fever prevention, and sadly more kids are now suffering from this preventable life long illness.</p>
<p>“Families sleeping in cars, garages, and cold overcrowded houses are bearing the brunt of this Government’s heartless inaction, but a Green Party in Government will put our kids first,” Ms Genter said.</p>
