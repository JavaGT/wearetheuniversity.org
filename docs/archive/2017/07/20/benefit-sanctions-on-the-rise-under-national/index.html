<p><strong>Benefit sanctions on the rise under National</strong></p>
<p>The National Government continues to punish beneficiaries and their children by enforcing benefit sanctions, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>The Government’s latest figures show an 8.2 percent increase in benefit sanctions <a href="https://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/statistics/benefit/index.html">than this time last year.</a></p>
<p>“Benefit sanctions punish families who are already struggling to get by, and punish them by pushing them further into poverty,” Green Party social development Jan Logie said.</p>
<p>“These are not the actions of a decent and compassionate government – benefit sanctions are punitive and cruel, and it’s going to take a change of government to get rid of them.</p>
<p>“When your income is cut in half or entirely, it is really hard to keep a roof over your family’s head. We need to be making sure that every family has the basics.</p>
<p>“More than half of people having their benefits sanctioned are Māori and Pasifika. This shows our welfare system is failing already disadvantaged communities.</p>
<p>“The figures released today also show that $12.6 million was spent on emergency housing grants this quarter, with almost 11,500 people needing help. This has skyrocketed from the initial <a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/emergency-housing-initiative-supporting-struggling-new-zealanders">2600 people</a> who needed assistance less than a year ago.</p>

<p>“The housing crisis is getting worse. More and more New Zealanders do not have enough money to put a roof over their family’s head, food on the table, or be able to pay the power bill.</p>
<p>“The housing crisis is National’s legacy – and it’s a shameful one.</p>
<p>“The Green Party in government will increase benefits across the board by 20 percent, and immediately end benefit sanctions.</p>
<p>“We will also undertake a government-sponsored house-building programme, that will put thousands more people in state and affordable homes,” said Ms Logie.</p>
