<p>Sports scholar sets world rowing first  </p>
<p>Lincoln University sports scholar Sam Bosworth has become the first male coxswain to win a Women&#39;s World Rowing event.</p>
<p>This is in the wake of a recent rule change in international rowing which allowed him to be selected as cox for the New Zealand women’s eight.</p>
<p>Sam from Waipara, in North Canterbury, claimed gold at the World Cup II regatta in Poznan, Poland, last month and has gone on to add a silver from World Cup III and a win over Great Britain at the prestigious Henley Regatta.</p>
<p>Coxswains are now gender neutral so they can jump in the boat with any crew, male or female.</p>
<p>He was selected for the women&#39;s eight in March.</p>
<p>“We had a solid 14 weeks training up at Lake Karapiro before heading to Europe in June. The last month has been packed with racing and training.”</p>
<p>Coxing women is not really that that different to coxing men, Sam said.</p>
<p>“Women have to be more delicate and aware of their technique as they cannot just rely on power. In terms of boat dynamics however, it is no different.</p>
<p>“We have to work very hard, perform as a team and have the common goal of wanting to get better.</p>
<p>“The girls bring energy and intent to everything we do and are very responsive. We talk about changes and make them. We have a great coach Dan Kelly and a great squad of girls, so we also have a lot of fun which I think is important,” he said.</p>
<p>They raced in Poznan, beating Great Britain, China and USA to win gold, then moved to Belgium for an intensive week of training ahead of the Henley Royal Regatta.</p>
<p>“Henley has been raced since 1839 and was a very different regatta with a head to head race with one other boat and a knock out situation over several days. We raced in the Remenhan Challenge Cup and had a good win over Great Britain in the final.</p>
<p>“The atmosphere of Henley is great, with the banks lined with boats, supporters, bars and party goers.”</p>
<p>It was then on to World Cup III in Lucerne where they were narrowly beaten by the Romanian crew.</p>
<p>“We were all very happy with our form and the progress we have made since being selected. It has been a very successful European campaign for the women&#39;s eight and the rest of the team.”</p>
<p>Sam and the eight are now back at Lake Karapiro but the work continues as they are in training for the September World Championships in Florida.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to be home and will now need to find more speed,” Sam said.</p>
