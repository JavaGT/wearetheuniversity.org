<p>Media Statement</p>
<p>6 July 2017</p>
<p>Bishop and Kaye hand out Duffy Books in Petone</p>
<p>National List MP based in Hutt South Chris Bishop joined Minister of Education Nikki Kaye at Pomare School this morning at a Duffy Books presentation as part of Government Book Week.</p>
<p>Duffy Books in Homes provides five free books per year to all children on the programme. During Government Book Week (the last week of Term Two each year) the Government funds one book per child on the Duffy Books programme. As part of this week nearly 100,000 students will be getting new books.</p>
<p>“It was awesome to present a box of books to each class at Pomare School. Getting our young people to develop a love of reading early in their lives is so important – and that’s what Duffy Books is all about.”</p>
<p>“Pomare gave us a very warm welcome – their singing was fantastic!”</p>
<p>“It was great to give these students an opportunity to be inspired by new and exciting books, helping build the reading skills vital to their future success.”</p>
