<p>Educators welcome Labour&#39;s plan to fix public education</p>
<p>21 July 2017</p>
<p>Educators welcome Labour&#39;s commitment to put the &#39;free&#39; back into free public education and to developing a plan to fix the chronic teacher shortage, NZEI Te Riu Roa says.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s full education manifesto, if implemented, would mark the beginning of a rebuild of schooling and early childhood education, which has suffered nearly a decade of underfunding,&quot; NZEI Te Riu Roa immediate past president Louise Green said.</p>
<p>&quot;Teachers and support staff are particularly pleased to see Labour acknowledge that every child, including those with additional learning needs, has the right to a great education.</p>
<p>&quot;More and more children are coming to school with complex additional needs that we are not resourced to meet. Labour&#39;s plan to fund a special needs coordinator (SENCO) in every school, centrally fund support staff, and work towards removing the cap on high needs funding, is a sign it&#39;s backing every child to succeed.</p>
<p>&quot;NZEI also applauds commitments that begin to put the &#39;free&#39; back into free public education, with the announcement that Labour would provide an extra $150 per student for schools that don&#39;t ask parents for donations.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s promise to address the teacher shortage with a proper recruitment and retention plan, including looking at voluntary bonding and guaranteed placements for beginning teachers, will help make teaching a more attractive option.<br>&quot;Educators resoundingly reject National Standards, and welcome the promise to replace them with a better system that encourages each child&#39;s unique potential,&quot; Mrs Green said.</p>
<p>Labour has previously announced it will back quality ECE by restoring funding for 100 percent qualified teachers. However, NZEI members look forward to it fully restoring funding that&#39;s been eroded from ECE after an eight year freeze on the per-hour per-child subsidy.</p>
<p>NZEI will also continue to push for smaller class sizes, which are not promised in Labour&#39;s plan.</p>
<p>&quot;This election is an opportunity to back children, and fix the chronic underfunding of education. All political parties should rise to this challenge,&quot; Mrs Green said.</p>
