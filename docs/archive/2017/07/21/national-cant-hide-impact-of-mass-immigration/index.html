<p>National Can’t Hide Impact of Mass Immigration</p>
<p>National has been saying for years that New Zealanders returning from overseas are responsible for the surge in immigration – that is hogwash, says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“The latest immigration figures from Statistics New Zealand show a new record high of net 72,300, predominantly made up of arrivals by non-NZ citizens.</p>
<p>“National is relying on massive population growth from immigration to superficially grow the economy through consumption.</p>
<p>“Their obsession with mass immigration continues to disadvantage hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders who are trying to buy houses, find jobs, get hospital treatment and even access education.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First will drastically reduce net immigration to a sensible level. That means going from National’s ridiculous levels to well below what Labour wants (40,000 to 50,000 a year) to around 10,000.</p>
<p>“This is a common sense number that would still allow New Zealand’s genuine skills shortages to be met.</p>
<p>“Many immigrants arriving are unskilled, though disguised under various immigration categories as having some fort of ‘profession’.</p>
<p>“We should be taking in people we need and will benefit our economy and not those who need us,” says Mr Peters.</p>
