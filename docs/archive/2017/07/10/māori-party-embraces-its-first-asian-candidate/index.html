<p>PRESS RELEASE<br>Tukoroirangi Morgan – President, Māori Party<br>Wetex Kang – Māori Party candidate for Botany<br>10 July 2017</p>
<p>Māori Party embraces its first Asian candidate</p>
<p>Wetex Kang of Malay and Chinese descent has been selected as the Māori Party candidate for the Botany electorate in this year&#39;s General Election.</p>
<p>&quot;Our party believes in a fair, diverse and inclusive Aotearoa so we&#39;re really excited about welcoming our first ever Asian candidate into our whare,&quot; said Māori Party president Tukoroirangi Morgan.</p>
<p>&quot;Wetex comes from a land and people who we as Māori share whakapapa with, so that in itself is something for us to celebrate.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#39;s also a highly intelligent and innovative young man passionate about the challenges and aspirations of not only our Asian whanaunga in this country but also tangata whenua.”</p>
<p>Wetex holds a Bachelor of Pharmacy (with Honours) from the University of Otago and received his Postgraduate Certificate in Education (Guidance Studies) and Graduate Diploma in Science (Psychology) from Massey University.<br>&quot;I&#39;m excited to be the Māori Party’s first ever Asian candidate. This candidacy symbolises a historical moment where the tangata whenua of Aotearoa can formally express manaakitanga, aroha, hospitality, generosity and mutual respect to all immigrants who’ve arrived in this beautiful land since the 1800s,&quot; said Wetex.</p>
<p>Botany is an ethnically diverse electorate where 39% of the electorate are Asians.</p>
<p>&quot;Cultural integration is a priority within this electorate so the current Botany MP cannot possibly be a voice for our people because he can&#39;t communicate efficiently with many of them from both a language and cultural standpoint.&quot;</p>
<p>Wetex is fluent in three Chinese dialects and understands Malay.</p>
<p>&quot;My goal is to be the true voice of Botany not via a translator!<br>“My campaign will focus on immigration, cultural integration, law and order, green energy and health.&quot;<br>Wetex is an ex-pharmacist and nutritionist with 20 years’ experience in the health and wellness industry. He currently runs a beekeeping and queen breeding company with a community education focus.</p>
