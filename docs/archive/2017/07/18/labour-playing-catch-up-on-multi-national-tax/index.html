<p>Labour playing catch-up on multi-national tax</p>
<p>The Labour Party is trying to play catch-up on multi-national tax, National Party Campaign Chair Steven Joyce says.</p>
<p>“The Government announced it will collect an initial $100 million a year in additional multi-national tax in the budget two months ago, and the Labour Party turns up today and announces they plan to collect an additional $200 million a year without any plan as to how to get there,” Mr Joyce says.</p>
<p>“We are currently wrapping up consultation on three separate areas of work to ensure multi-nationals pay their share of tax for their activities in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“These areas cover companies that use artificially high interest payments to shift profits offshore, companies that artificially avoid having a taxable presence in New Zealand, and companies that exploit hybrid mismatches between different countries tax rules.</p>
<p>&quot;These match the recommendations of the OECD working group on multinational tax. Officials aren’t recommending a diverted profits tax in New Zealand because it is unlikely to be effective.</p>
<p>“On top of that, New Zealand joined the new OECD multi-lateral Convention to prevent base erosion and profit shifting by multi-national companies when Judith Collins signed it in Paris recently. That updates several thousand tax treaties between OECD countries including New Zealand in just one go.</p>
<p>&quot;It is these practical steps that will make the difference, not writing to companies telling them that you&#39;d like them to pay their share of tax.</p>
<p>“The Government has a detailed plan currently being implemented on multi-national tax avoidance to ensure that all companies operating in New Zealand pay their fair share in tax. Labour are simply playing ‘me too’,” Mr Joyce says</p>
