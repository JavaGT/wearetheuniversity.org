<p>Agent Rubs Kiwi Noses in It with Chinese Purchase Post</p>
<p>The Auckland real estate agent <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11885213">complaining about a backlash</a> from New Zealanders should not be surprised, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Fiona Li, of Harcourts, is rubbing New Zealanders nose in it by posting a photo and words to Facebook that says: SOLD! ‘Very happy overseas buyers from China, just off plane arrived today. They are looking for more houses to buy’.</p>
<p>“While the agent argues she has a responsibility to her vendors to sell to the highest bidder, she hardly needed to post such a provocative photo and message.</p>
<p>“Of course she would get a backlash. But she wants to bear in mind there will be thousands of Kiwis out there who are angry but too polite to speak out. For that she can be grateful.</p>
<p>“Did she ever think what the reaction would be if the reverse was happening in Beijing?</p>
<p>“The National government has denied there is a housing crisis and has fiddled with the rules – but foreign players have played a huge role in pushing up prices around the country.”</p>
