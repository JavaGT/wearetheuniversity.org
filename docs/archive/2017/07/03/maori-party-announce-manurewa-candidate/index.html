<p><strong>Monday, 3 July 2017, 2:26 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party">The Maori Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Media release for immediate use</p>
<p>Rise of young politicians continues with new electorate candidate for Māori Party.</p>
<p>Tasha Hohaia has been selected by the Māori Party to stand for the Manurewa electorate in the 2017 General Election.</p>
<p>Currently the young professional is a Student Voice and Advocacy Facilitator in the tertiary sector.</p>
<p>Being Māori and Pakeha of Ngā Puhi descent, she has grown up in Auckland with a varied background in community development. A tertiary education in Law and Arts, with her long-term involvement in the New Zealand music scene, Hohaia has continually found creative ways of engagement across a range of demographics. She has toured nationally as a recording artist with a vision to promote positive messages for young audiences.</p>
<p>However it is her work in the tertiary sector that has seen her thrive in creating educational opportunities for the South Auckland community.</p>
<p>“I’m excited for the opportunity to stand for the Maori Party, for the Manurewa electorate, and for a fresh wave of vision. For me, it represents a space for connectedness, aroha, and care. I believe vision is as big as heart capacity, and I’ve learnt to lead, listen and love people”.</p>
<p>The young candidate has complete support from Maori Party president Tukoroirangi Morgan, “Tasha is a dynamic young leader who brings a fresh approach to advocacy and caring for Maori, Pasifika and young people. Her appreciation for diversity is valued and we look forward to engaging a younger audience in this year’s election”.  </p>
