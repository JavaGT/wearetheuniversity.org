<p>New charter schools to fragment and weaken public education</p>
<p>11 July 2017</p>
<p>Today’s Government announcement of two more charter schools does nothing to help the majority of Māori students learn, and could work to fragment and weaken the public school system.</p>
<p>Laures Park, NZEI Te Riu Roa Matua Takawaenga, said it was cynical to couch charter schools as some sort of educational solution for Māori when 85% of Māori children were in mainstream schools, with many others in kura kaupapa.</p>
<p>“I have no doubt that the people in the organisations behind these charter schools have nothing but the best intentions for the welfare and future of their tamariki.</p>
<p>“But the fact is, more than 85 percent of Māori tamariki go to mainstream public schools. It&#39;s a cop out for the Government to present charter schools as a solution for Māori, while failing to adequately resource the schools that the vast majority of Māori attend.</p>
<p>&quot;Māori and Pasifika children will continue to be let down by governments until politicians from all parties sit down with the educational experts and agree to do what&#39;s needed to improve education for all our tamariki.</p>
<p>&quot;The solution for Māori is in a strong public education system, including resourcing the overcrowded Rotorua kura kaupapa that will now be competing with a cashed-up charter school,” said Ms Park.</p>
