<p>Science, junk science, and how to tell the difference</p>
<p>UC Connect Public Lecture: Science, junk science, and how to tell the difference</p>
<p>How do we tell the difference between science, pseudo-science, anti-science rhetoric and ‘alternative facts’?</p>
<p>As the famous astrophysicist Carl Sagan once said, “We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology in which hardly anybody knows anything about science and technology”.</p>
<p>Why is the language of science and scientific achievement often viewed with suspicion and, at times, derision?</p>
<p>In the upcoming UC Connect public lecture <em>Science, junk science, and how to tell the difference</em>, Adjunct Professor Simon Pollard will talk about the rewards and frustrations of communicating science to a wide audience.</p>
<p>Dr Simon Pollard is Adjunct Professor of Science Communication at the University of Canterbury. He is a spider biologist and award-winning writer and photographer. He has been involved in contributing to the public understanding of science through writing, exhibitions, lectures and advising on natural history documentaries for 25 years.</p>
<p>He has been an advisor on three Attenborough BBC series; most recently <em>The Hunt</em> in 2015. In 2016, he spent two days a week in Wellington as the external science advisor to Te Papa and Weta Workshop on the $5 million exhibition Bug Lab. Currently, he is writing a book for Te Papa Press on New Zealand natural history for younger readers.</p>
<p><em>UC Connect public lecture: Science, junk science, and how to tell the difference</em>, Adjunct Professor Simon Pollard, 7pm on Wednesday 19 Julyat the University of Canterbury.</p>
