<p>Well-being can improve quickly by eating more fresh fruit and vegetables  </p>
<p>Lifting your intake of fruit and vegetables can make a difference to the way you feel in just a couple of weeks, a University of Otago study has found.</p>
<p>A team of five academics, led by Dr Tamlin Conner of the Department of Psychology, investigated the effects of increasing fruit and vegetable consumption on changes in psychological well-being.</p>
<p>Their study involved 171 young adults aged 18-25, split into three groups. Over a fortnight, they either continued eating as normal, or were encouraged by text reminders and pre-paid vouchers to eat more fruit and vegetables, or were personally given two extra daily servings of fresh produce (carrots, kiwifruit, apples and oranges).</p>
<p>Those in the last group reported significant improvements to their psychological well-being, with boosts in vitality and motivation.</p>
<p>However, those reminded by text and given $10 vouchers did not show a similar improvement and, when surveyed, were found more likely to have eaten cooked vegetables in casseroles or mixed in with other meals.</p>
<p>The group given fresh fruit and vegetables mostly ate them uncooked.</p>
<p>The study has just been published in the journal PLOS ONE. It can be read at <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171206">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171206</a><br>Dr Conner said it was encouraging that increased healthy eating could improve feelings of well-being in just two weeks.</p>
<p>“The message from this study is we should be giving people more fruits and vegetables to eat, not simply reminding people to eat their 5+ a day.</p>

<p>“People in dormitories, children in daycare centres, patients in hospitals, employees in the workplace, could be provided with fresh fruits and vegetables on a regular basis.”</p>
<p>Further research would be needed to address whether eating more fresh produce might make differences to people’s ill-being, including conditions such as depression.</p>
<p>These changes might take longer to happen, Dr Conner said.</p>
