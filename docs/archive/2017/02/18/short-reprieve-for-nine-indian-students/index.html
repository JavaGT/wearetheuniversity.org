<p>Short reprieve for nine Indian students</p>
<p>A temporary hold on deportations of nine Indian students is a step in the right direction but the Government urgently needs to implement safeguards to stop further injustices to more international students, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>Immigration NZ has indicated that deportation orders will not be served till February 22 while it considers a request for the students to leave voluntarily. The students India-based education agents used fake documents to secure their study visas in New Zealand, and hundreds more students face a similar situation.</p>
<p>“These students have been duped by a Government that didn’t provide enough oversight of our international education system,” Green Party immigration spokesperson Denise Roche said.</p>
<p>“For the nine students who have been holed up at the Unitarian Church in Ponsonby, it is good news that the deportation orders have now been lifted.</p>
<p>“These students have been courageous in shining a light on the duplicitous practices that they were exposed to, and their case needs to be a call for changing the lax checks and balances for our international students.</p>
<p>“Even if these students do go back to India, we will fight for them to be able to come back. The cases need to be assessed individually, compassionately, and fairly.</p>
<p>“It is shameful for the education providers that they employ education agents to represent them, but then take no responsibility for what happens to the students.</p>
<p>“The Government needs to step up and take responsibility for its mistakes, by improving oversight of the system and offering better protection for students who are scammed by overseas agents.</p>

<p>“Steven Joyce wants to increase international education in this country by another $2 billion dollars, but his Government is failing in its duty of care to students who are already here.</p>
<p>“We need to provide more oversight for students coming here to study, and this ordeal has shown the urgent need for the Government to license education agents offshore.</p>
<p>“Until the Government changes the system, we will have more students being duped in the name of following a dream to come to New Zealand. It’s not exactly the image that New Zealand internationally prides itself on,” Ms Roche said.  </p>
