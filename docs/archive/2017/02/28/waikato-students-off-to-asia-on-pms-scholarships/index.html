<p>28 February, 2017<br><strong>Waikato students off to Asia on PM&#39;s scholarships</strong></p>

<p>Four University of Waikato students have been awarded a combined total of more than $32,000 through the Prime Minister’s Scholarship for Asia (PMSA).</p>
<p>Davis Palmer (21), Emma Carroll (21) and Liam Wright (23) have won scholarships to study abroad while Mark Will (26) is doing a research internship with the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation (IGCI).</p>
<p>The scholarships are from the first 2016/17 PMSA round, and cover the students&#39; study or work fees, travel and accommodation costs.</p>
<p>Thanks to a research agreement between the University’s cyber security lab and IGCI in Singapore, Mark will spend the next three months interning there as part of his PhD study.</p>
<p>“This is an opportunity for me to experience working overseas, make new networks and learn about international cyber law enforcement,” says Mark.</p>
<p>Fourth-year management student Davis is studying for a semester at Chinese University of Hong Kong. The former Hamilton Boys’ High School student chose Hong Kong because it’s a major global business hub.</p>
<p>“I’d love to work in Asia after I graduate,” says Davis. “This exchange is the perfect opportunity to establish business connections, experience the Hong Kong culture and travel with new friends.”</p>

<p>Emma is in her third year of a Bachelor of Science (Technology) and doing a five-month exchange at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Originally from Whanganui, Emma says the culture in Singapore is incredible.</p>
<p>“Living in a hyper city is crazy,” says Emma. “There are 5.6 million people living in a country the size of Lake Taupo. Needless to say it’s very different to what I’m used to back home.”</p>
<p>Bachelor of Arts student Liam is completing an Asian Studies Program at Kansai Gaidai University in Japan.</p>
<p>“Kansai Gaidai is a bi-lingual university so while many of my papers are taught in English it’s a great opportunity to improve my Japanese skills,” says Liam.<br>Applications for round two of the 2017 PMSA close 30 March 2017. The PMSA programme is funded by the New Zealand government and administered by Education New Zealand.</p>
