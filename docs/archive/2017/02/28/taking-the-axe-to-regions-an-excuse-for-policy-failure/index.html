<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters<br>New Zealand First Leader<br>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>28 FEBRUARY 2017</p>
<p>Taking the Axe to Regional Towns an Excuse for Policy Failure</p>
<p>A group of Right-wing, neo-liberal researchers wants to kill off New Zealand regional towns by selective engineering, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“The Maxim Institute, peddlers of failed economic policy, has run a ruler over the country and decided 44 out of 67 territorial authorities could be on the cusp of decline and suggests “communities” should make a decision to “exit” or not,” says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“What they forget is that governments have failed in the fundamentals of economic policy to ensure the wealth creators - regional exporters - have their fair share of wealth returned to them.</p>
<p>“That’s why New Zealand’s inflated dollar, admitted by most economic economists, continues on unaddressed. Even the IMF has pointed this out.</p>
<p>“But when you are on the big city consumption tap governments refuse to act.</p>
<p>“Despite the regions creating much of the wealth of this country the high dollar and failure of infrastructural investment means they are losing ground.</p>
<p>“It is regional NZ that tourists flock to, yet the government fails to return the bulk of its GST receipts to those areas and pays lip service to tourism infrastructural needs.</p>
<p>“These regional NZ doomsayers are parked up in the big cities, and simply have no plan for the regions, or that matter New Zealand.</p>

<p>“They want smart growth – whatever that phrase is supposed to mean.</p>
<p>“Then perhaps they should explain why they defend a stupid, unfocused immigration policy that is bringing in tens of thousands of older people.</p>
<p>“They say, ‘regional development policy is an easy way for politicians to spend a lot of money for mostly political gain’.</p>
<p>“So, road building in the regions is for votes, and motorways around Auckland is for exactly what?</p>
<p>“Clearly these overflown influence peddlers are aligned to the National Party as they were once to Rogernomics and Ruthanomics.</p>
<p>“Their real test as to whether they have any economic credibility is their abysmal failure to admit that 2 per cent of our economic growth is purely driven by immigration whilst they ignore all its attendant costs.</p>
<p>“It’s that sort of thinking that got us into this mess, which is why they cannot be trusted to get us out of it.</p>
<p>“Southland is 3% of the population producing about 18% of exports, but you don’t see BMWs, Audis and Mercedes cramming the streets of Invercargill,” says Mr Peters.</p>
