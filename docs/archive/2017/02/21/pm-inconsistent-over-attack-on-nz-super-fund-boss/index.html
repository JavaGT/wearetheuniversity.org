<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters<br>New Zealand First Leader<br>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>21 FEBRUARY 2017</p>
<p>Prime Minister Inconsistent Over Attack on NZ Super Fund Boss</p>
<p>NZ Superannuation Fund chief executive Adrian Orr must wonder why he has been targeted by the Prime Minister, says New Zealand First and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First believes in pay for performance and the Super Fund has over achieved in every respect.</p>
<p>“Mr Orr has taken a fund, which Mr English froze contributions into in 2009, and despite global uncertainty has grown it to over $32bn. It has a world leading performance for a sovereign fund.</p>
<p>“Contrast that with Mr English, who as the Minister of Finance, made taxpayers bail out a number of failing finance companies, including South Canterbury Finance, and further, he has built up a mountain of public debt in this country.</p>
<p>“Solid Energy has not only tipped over on his watch, but its CEO was paid $1.1m last year; much more than what Mr Orr is paid and yet Solid Energy is about to go into liquidation.</p>
<p>“What has Mr English got to say about the pay to CEO’s of our once 100 per cent-owned power companies, all on staggering incomes whilst running a monopoly?</p>
<p>“The reason is Mr English doesn’t like the Superannuation Fund despite it being a model of conservative thinking. Its success shows him up badly. National opposed its establishment yet its performance has made their opposition look ridiculous.</p>
<p>“In fact, if Mr English hadn’t stopped contributions in 2009, in favour of tax cuts to the wealthy, the Super Fund would be worth well over $50 billion. Mr English even imposed a tax on the Fund.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First is not defending high salaries but why attack the very one that most justifies it? says Mr Peters.</p>
