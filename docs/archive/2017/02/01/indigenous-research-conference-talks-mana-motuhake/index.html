<p>“We are honoured to have amazing speakers that work with their communiities, challenging colonial and state oppression,” says Dr Pihama.</p>
<p>“We have cutting-edge scholars, activisits and researchers coming together to strategise how we can work across our Indigenous Nations for the wellbeing of our people and the earth.”</p>
<p>Several hundred people are expected to attend the conference with visitors from Australia, Hawaii Canada and America mixing with academics, researchers, students and community representatives from around New Zealand.</p>
<p><em>The Conference theme, ‘Mana Motuhake:</em> Indigenous Sovereignty’ recognises that around the world Indigenous Nations are engaged in movements that are focused upon the affirmation of peoples as tangata whenua, the people of the land.</p>
<p>“Taking space as Indigenous People to come together and share our work related to Mana Motuhake gives us the opportunity to look at critical concepts such of autonomy, self-determination, independence sovereignty and having authority over our own lives,” says Dr Pihama.</p>
