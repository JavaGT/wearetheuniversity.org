<p><strong>Victoria offers accredited courses for patent attorneys</strong></p>
<p>In a first for a New Zealand university, Victoria University of Wellington’s Faculty of Law is now offering accredited courses under the new trans-Tasman patent attorney registration scheme.</p>
<p>Commencing on 24 February 2017, the new scheme merges the New Zealand and Australian regulatory regimes for patent attorneys, allowing them to practice in both jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Completing a series of courses accredited by the Professional Standards Board (PSB), such as those offered by Victoria University, is compulsory to qualify under the new scheme.</p>
<p>Professor Susy Frankel, an expert in intellectual property law, says that providing world-class postgraduate training in support of New Zealand’s legal profession is a priority for Victoria’s Faculty of Law.</p>
<p>“Victoria’s courses enable those wishing to become registered patent attorneys to do so at a New Zealand university.</p>
<p>“The robust provision of specialist advice regarding intellectual property can help support and drive innovation. Patent attorneys play an important role in ensuring businesses know how to protect their IP assets, making it worthwhile to invest in areas such as research and development, and helping enable consumer trust.”</p>
