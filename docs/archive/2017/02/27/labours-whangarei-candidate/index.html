<p>Media Release <strong>Labour’s Whangarei Candidate</strong></p>
<p>Monday 27 February 2017</p>
<p>Tony Savage has been selected as the Labour Party candidate for Whangarei for the 2017 General Election.</p>
<p>“I am pleased to be Labour’s candidate for the 2017 election and I look forward to representing the Whangarei electorate in Parliament,” says Tony Savage.</p>
<p>Being a strong advocate for fairness and dignity for all, and fighting for those without a voice or privilege is at the core of Tony’s decision to stand as Labour’s candidate for Whangarei.</p>
<p>“I am excited to become an advocate for Whangarei, and Northland, after years of failure and neglect from the current National government,” he says.</p>
<p>“I would like to see Whangarei and Northland becoming the vibrant caring communities they are capable of being – with much less unemployment and housing problems, and improved health among all our people, and I will be working towards this goal.”</p>
<p>Tony has an employment background as a CEO, technology adviser, strategy consultant, financial adviser as well as being a successful local lawyer in Whangarei practicing mainly within the commercial and property fields. Educated as a lawyer at Auckland and holding an MBA from the University of Auckland, Tony brings a business focus to the role of politics, and “a belief that so much more is possible” to enhance life in Whangarei.</p>
<p>Since he moved to Whangarei in 2004, Tony Savage has used those same skills to the voluntary and community organisations he has been involved in – the Whangarei Music Society, Rotary, being a trustee on both secondary and intermediate schools in Whangarei (Boys High and Whangarei Intermediate), the Northland Community Foundation and other local groups.</p>
<p>With such a broad range of interests, Tony Savage’s commitment to and involvement in Whangarei is a role model for community leadership – a role he wants to expand to help take Whangarei towards an exciting future.</p>
