<p>Richard Prosser MP</p>
<p>Spokesperson for Primary Industries<br>9 FEBRUARY 2017<br>Another Rabbit Virus a Backward Step</p>
<p>Otago Regional Council’s plans to introduce a new virus to kill rabbits is a massive backward step, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“Wild rabbits are a huge economic cost to farmers, but to release the K5 virus, knowing it will only knock down 40 per cent, and numbers will bounce back in a few years is madness.</p>
<p>“K5 virus is a variant of the rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHDV1) strain already in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“There is no guarantee the virus won’t mutate and jump species, it causes inhumane deaths and is a threat to the country’s 100,000 pet rabbits as there is no vaccine.</p>
<p>“The initial illegal release in 1997 of the RHD virus, or calicivirus as it was thought to be at the time, occurred as a result of an inadequate response by the Government to a problem that could have been solved using proven methods – and we’re about to do it again.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First believes an alternative approach to pest control must be used in order to preserve our country&#39;s ecological integrity and reputation, and to address essential animal welfare concerns. We could be harvesting them for profit.</p>
<p>“Rabbit meat is in high demand in restaurants overseas. Pet food manufacturers can’t get enough of it.</p>
<p>“Rabbit control should involve properly resourced, bounty-based, target-specific methods that create jobs and income, while allowing for overall numbers to be reduced to below a problematic threshold, not indiscriminate poisons and viral methods with no antidote,” says Mr Prosser</p>
