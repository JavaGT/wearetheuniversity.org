<p>Sisters Michelle Harden and Angela Brewer</p>
<p>Two sisters supported each other through the long commute from Kerikeri to Whangarei so they could study to become primary school teachers.</p>
<p>Angela Brewer and Michelle Harden’s efforts paid on Friday when they both graduated with Bachelor of Education (Primary) degrees from the University of Auckland’s Tai Tokerau Campus.</p>
<p>Angela, 38, and Michelle, 32, decided to become teachers after previous careers. Angela worked in photography and design, and Michelle was a hairdresser.</p>
<p>After Angela had a baby, and Michelle had three children they both became stay-at-home mums before deciding to return to study.</p>
<p>“Some of my best memories stem from my own primary school days. I believe the education is the most powerful way to promote positive change in our society and I was really excited and motivated to be a part of that,” Michelle said.Angela was inspired by the birth of her son in 2008.</p>
<p>“When my eldest child was born he became my inspiration. Watching his learning journey evolve ignited my passion for teaching and learning. When he was two I began my journey towards becoming a qualified teacher,” Angela said.</p>
<p>Both sisters had their study interrupted by the birth of another child. For Angela, it was her second, and for Michelle, her fourth.</p>
<p>They both returned to study for their degrees part time, Michelle initially studied in Auckland before joining Angela in Kerikeri in 2015.</p>
<p>They commuted to the Faculty of Education and Social Work’s Tai Tokerau Campus on the days they had lectures.</p>
<p>“It was well worth the travel down from Kerikeri,” Angela said.</p>
<p>“We spent two hours a day commuting to Whangarei when we digested and discussed our learning.”</p>
<p>They enjoyed the supportive atmosphere at Tai Tokerau.</p>
<p>“I found it to be an extremely supportive environment where everyone knows each other. I think being a smaller campus helped create this encouraging supportive culture. The staff have an excellent quality of expertise and are really friendly,” Angela said.</p>
<p>The sisters are particularly grateful to staff Judy Taingahue and Lindsay Laing for their help and support.</p>
<p>Both sisters were supported by their family and friends at graduation.</p>
<p>Michelle is now teaching Year 0-2 at Oromahoe School, and Angela teaches years 2 and 3 at the Bay of Islands International Academy.</p>
<p>“Teaching is like no other job. There is nothing quite like the knowledge that you are making a positive difference in the lives of others. I love working and collaborating with other visionary teachers and have learnt so much from our supportive team.</p>
<p>“I would definitely recommend teaching to anyone who realises just how precious our tamariki are, they are our future,” Angela said.</p>
<p>Michelle agrees. “Teaching so far is super busy, but already so rewarding. I&#39;m absolutely loving it.”</p>
