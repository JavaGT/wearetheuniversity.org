<p>Strength training carries weight for obese teens</p>
<p>Date: 20 February 2017</p>
<p><strong>Strength training is a must-do for obese teenagers and even outperforms cardio when it comes to health benefits.</strong><br>That’s according to Lincoln University Sport and Recreation Associate Professor Mike Hamlin, who has evaluated existing research on how exercise affects adolescents with weight issues.</p>
<p>He found that obese people who strength train regularly often have similar cardiovascular health to fit individuals of a healthy weight.</p>
<p>&quot;This has significant implications for young people,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>“Children and teenagers should be exercising for at least an hour a day, according to the World Health Organisation. But this can be a problem for obese kids, who are disadvantaged by the effort and pain associated with moving a large mass.</p>
<p>“That’s where strength training is helpful, because it doesn’t place as much stress on the joints as intense aerobic exercise.”</p>
<p>Associate Professor Hamlin says there is constant debate about the advantages of nutrition and exercise, with previous reports indicating that physical activity has little effect on weight.</p>
<p>“Our study clearly suggests otherwise,” he says. “Exercise plus nutrition leads to a moderate improvement in body composition.</p>
<p>“But while exercise alone leads to some improvement, the effects of nutrition alone are inconclusive.”</p>
<p>The study found that the best programme for improving body composition involves high-repetition strength training and low-intensity aerobic exercise.</p>

<p>“But for long-term, sustainable change, we need to consider the environmental, social and economic factors of affected populations.”</p>
<p>Associate Professor Hamlin says the findings have implications for primary healthcare providers and are important due to the global rise in obesity amongst young people.</p>
<p>“It would be good to see exercise prescription become a formal part of medical school education.</p>
<p>“Studies suggest that New Zealand primary healthcare practitioners are often uncomfortable prescribing exercise.”</p>
<p>He says a solution could involve making exercise prescription and behavioural medicine a part of medical education programmes, or creating an integrated system for recommending exercise programmes to patients.</p>
<p>Green Prescription, a programme funded by the Ministry of Health to support active living, does not cater to adolescents as it is limited to adults aged 18 or over.  </p>
