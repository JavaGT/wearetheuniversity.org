<p>Want to be in the Guinness Book of Records? Do you have the ability, and the inclination to throw farm footwear over a line with hundreds of other people in a field?</p>
<p>Then the Lincoln University Student Association (LUSA) needs you.</p>
<p>They are looking for people to take part in their gumboot throwing world record attempt, The Great Gumboot Toss.</p>
<p>No previous experience required. Just bring a gumboot. LUSA are looking to take the record back from Massey University who claimed it last year with 478. Lincoln set the record in 2013 with 348 people.</p>
<p>LUSA Vice president Tessa Williams says they are hoping for 500 people for the attempt on Tuesday 28 February at 11am on the University sports fields.</p>
<p>“Everyone is welcome. We have it set up through Guinness World Records so it will be official. There will a chance to have a bit of practice around 10.30am and afterwards there will be the South Island Gumboot throwing championships, so if you find a bit of hidden talent you could have a go at that.</p>
<p>“Distance is not the issue for the record attempt. We all just get together and give it a hurl.”</p>
<p>Let’s bring the record home.</p>
<p>Go to the LUSA Website for more details <a href="https://www.lusa.org.nz/orientation">https://www.lusa.org.nz/orientation</a></p>
<p>• Media are invited to attend the record attempt, and there will be gumboots available for those who want to participate in the event.</p>
