<p><strong>Thursday, 23 February 2017, 1:01 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>23 FEBRUARY 2017  </p>
<p><strong>Chances of Catching Crooked Bosses Remote</strong></p>
<p>National’s new legislation against employers exploiting <a href="http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2017/02/migrant-employers-face-ban-on-hiring-for-breaking-law.html">migrant workers</a> is a limp response to a major problem and simply political window-dressing, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse admits himself the legislation is about prevention rather than prosecution.</p>
<p>“Where are the increased numbers of workers for the under-resourced Labour Inspectorate to fully implement the legislation?</p>
<p>“The inspectorate has only 54 officers for the entire country; if Mr Woodhouse was really serious he would pump up the inspectorate immediately.</p>
<p>“The main purpose of this legislation is for the minister to give the impression he is doing something about entrenched and widespread worker exploitation that was recently graphically outlined in a study <em>Worker Exploitation in NZ: A Troubling Landscape</em> by Dr Christina Stringer of Auckland University.</p>
<p>“The study showed all sectors of our economy – construction, fishing, hospitality, dairy, horticulture, viticulture and international education – are exploiting migrant workers.</p>
<p>“Mr Woodhouse and the National Party are the only ones denying this reality.</p>
<p>“Dr Stringer said non-compliance with existing employment legislation was common.</p>
<p>“It will be the same with this latest legislation.</p>
<p>“With the chances of getting caught so remote, the law will be widely ignored,” says Mr Peters.</p>
