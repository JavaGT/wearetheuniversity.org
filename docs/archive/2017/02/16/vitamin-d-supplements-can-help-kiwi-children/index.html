<p>New Zealand children can benefit from vitamin D supplements that protect against acute respiratory infections, according to a new study.</p>
<p>The study that was published today in the British Medical Journal, combined information from 25 clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation performed in 14 different countries including two studies conducted in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Across this entire age range and irrespective of the person’s vitamin D status when they joined each study, vitamin D supplements were shown to be safe and to have a modest beneficial effect in preventing acute respiratory infections.</p>
<p>The study combined information about more than 11,000 people aged 0 to 95 years who were participants in these studies with vitamin D provided in the different studies from as short a time as seven weeks to as long a time as 18 months. The beneficial effect of vitamin D was larger for people with vitamin D deficiency.</p>
<p>How the vitamin D supplement was given also influenced whether or not it was beneficial. If vitamin D was given as a daily or weekly dose then it was helpful, but if given as larger doses less frequently then it did not prevent acute respiratory infections.</p>
<p>“These findings have important implications for New Zealand where both vitamin D deficiency and acute respiratory infections are common”, says study co-author, University of Auckland Head of Paediatrics and Starship Paediatrician, Professor Cameron Grant.</p>
<p>“Both of these health problems are particular issues in young children, especially those of non-European ethnicity,” he says.</p>
<p>“For example, in Auckland, vitamin D deficiency severe enough to cause rickets is present in 24 percent of Pacific children and 11 percent of Māori compared with three percent of European children,” says Dr. Grant.</p>
<p>“Pneumonia hospitalisation rates in preschool children are several times higher in Pacific and Māori children than they are in European children,” he says.</p>
<p>“Vitamin D supplementation has the potential to prevent some of the excess respiratory disease that Pacific and Māori children experience and help them to experience better respiratory health.”</p>
<p>A new study funded by Cure Kids and being conducted by the University of Auckland at Starship Children’s Hospital is seeking to determine if vitamin D supplementation can prevent children from having repeated hospital admission with acute respiratory infections.
