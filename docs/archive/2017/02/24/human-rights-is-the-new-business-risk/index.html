<p><strong>Human rights is the new business risk</strong></p>
<p>Globalisation has sharpened debate on the responsibility of corporations for their human rights footprint but the question of how they can be held liable for human rights violations remains.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Law Foundation International Dispute Resolution Fellow 2017, Professor Robert Volterra, is giving a public lecture hosted by Victoria University of Wellington on Thursday 2 March entitled <em>Human Rights is the New Business Risk—New Challenges in Dispute Resolution.</em></p>
<p>Professor Robert Volterra is widely regarded as one of the world’s leading public international law practitioners. He advises and represents governments, international organisations and private clients on international public law issues, including business and human rights issues, international boundaries, sovereign and diplomatic immunities, the Law of the Sea, transboundary resources and bilateral investment treaties.</p>
<p>Professor Volterra was part of New Zealand’s external legal team in the 1996 reprise of the Nuclear Tests Case against France. A partner at VolterraFietta, London, he also teaches international foreign investment law and international boundary disputes at University College London and Kings’ College London.</p>
<p>The public lecture is in partnership with the New Zealand Law Foundation, the New Zealand Centre for Public Law, and the New Zealand Centre of International Economic Law.</p>
<p>“Professor Volterra has expertise in all aspects of international business and human rights, including taking indigenous and environmental concerns into account, dispute resolution for small states, and the future of investment arbitration in the Trump era,” says Victoria University’s Professor Petra Butler. He is available for media interviews.</p>
