<p>Andrew Little</p>
<p>Leader of the Opposition</p>
<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>2February 2017</p>
<p>English fails to show real leadership</p>
<p>Bill English is following rather than leading on the issue of safe communities with his promise of more Police, says Labour Leader Andrew Little.</p>
<p>“National is playing desperate catch-up after we backed him into a corner.</p>
<p>“We recognised there was a crime problem last October which is why we promised 1000 sworn Police officers.</p>
<p>“For eight years National has failed to invest in our Police force and support front line Police officers.</p>
<p>“He refused Judith Collin’s plea for more Police as Finance Minister. In May last year he signed off on a four year freeze on Police numbers. Now lo and behold 233 days to the election, comes this promise</p>
<p>“Labour welcomes more Police, but National had to be dragged kicking and screaming to today’s announcement.</p>
<p>“What this really shows is a Government that has run out of ideas. They are out of touch.</p>
<p>“This was supposed to be his first major speech as Prime Minister. But what we actually got was a skinny version of a Labour policy and no mention of the housing crisis, the single biggest worry facing thousands of New Zealanders who are struggling to afford their first home.</p>
<p>“This was a speech desperately lacking energy. It was woefully short on vision for this country. It’s time for a fresh approach. It’s time to change the Government,” says Andrew Little.</p>
