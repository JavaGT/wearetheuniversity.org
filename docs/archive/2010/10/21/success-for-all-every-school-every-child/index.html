<p><strong>Associate Education Minister Rodney Hide</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Speech to Launch &#39;Success for All - Every School, Every Child&#39;;</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Cornwall Park School, Greenlane Road West, Greenlane, Auckland; Wednesday 20 October 2010</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s great to be here today and thank you for your warm welcome.</p>
<p>I&#39;m here because your school is a great example of what being an inclusive school is all about. It&#39;s about making sure that you all can take part fully in everything you do here.</p>
<p>We are here to launch a plan of action for special education - Success for All, Every School, Every Child.</p>
<p>I&#39;m new to Special Education, and in the last six weeks I have had the privilege of listening to other people&#39;s stories - parents, teachers and colleagues - about what is working and what isn&#39;t working well for children.</p>
<p>I heard a story from one of my colleagues, about a child with very high needs - let&#39;s call her Mary - who was enrolled at a local school. The school said that as Mary&#39;s health was getting worse, the school didn&#39;t have the ability to support her - even with specialist support in place.</p>
<p>The parents were asked to take Mary out of that school. My colleague sided with the school, agreeing that it was &#39;just too difficult&#39; for them to support Mary.</p>
<p>What my colleague didn&#39;t know was that when Mary moved to the other school things changed.</p>
<p>Teachers and children at the new school didn&#39;t have any experience with a child like Mary. But what they did have was a willingness to learn and a desire to help. They were open to the challenge and accepted Mary with all her differences.</p>

<p>Mary&#39;s life is very busy in her new school. She does art, music, swimming, and community activities in a class with other children. She is at an ordinary school where the people have created an extraordinary environment for Mary and her classmates.</p>
<p>Mary&#39;s story taught me about what I call &#39;soft prejudice&#39; about disability; that is belief that nothing can change.</p>
<p>Success for All, Every School, Every Child sets out the changes for children like Mary that will be made over the next four years.</p>
<p>I believe all schools can be as welcoming and inclusive as Mary&#39;s new school - and yours - by 2014.</p>
<p>Parent&#39;s should have the right to choose where their child goes to school.</p>
<p>Therefore, I&#39;ll be keeping the special schools that provide support to children with very high needs, and encouraging them to provide more specialist out-reach teaching.</p>
<p>Eleven hundred more children will get Ongoing and Reviewable Resourcing Schemes support, and a further thousand will be able to get specialist support in their first years of school.</p>
<p>There will also be more flexible services and support for deaf, blind or low vision children.</p>
<p>I want it to be easier for children with special education needs and their families to get extra help. I&#39;ll be finding better ways to bring together the support they receive.</p>
<p>In four years time I expect to see:</p>
<p>* All schools welcoming and including every child. * All children learning and succeeding, and getting the extra help they need when they need it. * Parents who can see that their child belongs, has friends and is learning and succeeding; * Parents receiving good information - without having to fight for it.</p>
<p>I understand that for some this is going to be a challenge.</p>
<p>It is going to take a fundamental shift in our attitudes and our mindsets but it can be done.</p>
<p>I know it can be done as there are schools out there that are already doing it.</p>
<p>Schools like Cornwall Park District School.</p>
<p>Everyone in education - including teachers, principals, boards, Government - needs to make sure every child gets a fair go.</p>
<p>That way all young New Zealanders will succeed.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>ENDS  </p>
