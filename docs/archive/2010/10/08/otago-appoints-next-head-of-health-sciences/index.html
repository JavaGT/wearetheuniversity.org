<p><strong>Otago Appoints Next Head of Health Sciences</strong></p>
<p>The University of Otago has selected Professor Peter Crampton as its next Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Health Sciences. He will also be the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine.</p>
<p>The Pro-Vice-Chancellor heads a Division which is New Zealand’s leading provider of education and research in health and biomedical sciences. The Division comprises Schools of Medical Sciences, Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy and Physiotherapy, and it includes campuses in Christchurch and Wellington as well as Dunedin.</p>
<p>Professor Crampton was selected from a strong field of local and international candidates. He is currently the Dean and Head of Campus at the University of Otago, Wellington.</p>
<p>After graduating from the University of Otago Medical School in 1985, Peter Crampton worked as a general practitioner before training in Public Health Medicine. His PhD thesis was on aspects of the delivery of primary health care. Professor Crampton was awarded a Harkness Fellowship in Health Policy, which took him to Johns Hopkins University in the United States in 2002 – 2003. In 2004 he was appointed as Professor and Head of the Department of Public Health at the University of Otago, Wellington. He became the Dean in February 2008.</p>
<p>Announcing his appointment, Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg said that Professor Crampton is an ideal person to undertake this key role.</p>
<p>“Peter Crampton is highly respected, not only as an academic, but also for his leadership qualities and his understanding of the wider health sector. The University recognises the importance of working collaboratively with many health boards and agencies, and Professor Crampton will play a key part in this. As someone who has spent most of his career at one of our northern campuses, he will also bring an important perspective to the University’s executive group.”</p>

<p>Professor Crampton says he is delighted to have the opportunity to take up the role.</p>
<p>“The Division of Health Sciences is important on account of its significant contribution to the University of Otago and because of the national scope of the Division’s Faculties and Schools.</p>
<p>“The role offers me the opportunity both to serve the University and to help meet the needs of the New Zealand population through supporting and nurturing the Division’s extensive and wide-reaching teaching and research programmes. It also offers exciting opportunities for health workforce development, in particular the Maori and Pacific components of the workforce.”</p>
<p>Professor Crampton will succeed Professor Don Roberton, when he retires on 1 February 2011. The Vice-Chancellor paid tribute to the outstanding job done by Professor Roberton over the last five years. “As Don Roberton retires and returns to Australia, we are very conscious of the splendid contribution he has made both to the University of Otago and to the development of the New Zealand health workforce.”</p>
