<p><strong>ERO report on Maori achievement an indictment: Maori Party</strong></p>
<p>The Education Review Office report &#39;Promoting Success for Maori Students: Schools&#39; progress&#39; confirms what Maori have been saying for generations - there is a crisis of failure in our school system, and Maori whanau are suffering the consequences, according to Maori Party Co-leader Dr Pita Sharples.</p>
<p>&quot;The report says around one third of schools are doing OK; while another third of secondary schools, and nearly half of primary schools, have woken up to the problem and are starting to make improvements,&quot; said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>&quot;The rest simply simply do not seem to care. They fail to monitor the achievements of their Maori students; they fail to use the professional support that&#39;s offered; and they fail to involve Maori families in the education of Maori students.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet it is their Maori students who are branded as failures,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The worst scandal is that there are programmes to help schools, such as Kotahitanga, and the Ministry of Education&#39;s Maori education strategy Ka Hikitia, but the schools with a crisis are refusing the help available.</p>
<p>&quot;The ERO says it has been reporting on this problem for ten years. It is good to see it starting to take action at last. I understand schools that do not address Maori achievement will come under review more often. About time!</p>
<p>&quot;There are clearly schools which put Maori students at risk of lifelong failure, with all the catastrophic consequences of that.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the ERO should name those schools, and consider more urgent interventions to protect the present and future welfare of their Maori students. For example, if professional leadership has failed, then installing commissioners should be considered,&quot; said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>&quot;Lack of data for Maori achievement is a problem in some schools. With the introduction of NCEA, Maori students achieved better, especially in Year 9. National Standards may also show how Maori student achievement links to a school&#39;s professional practice.</p>
<p>&quot;This report is a wake-up call, and we will be looking for a serious response from schools and the government,&quot; said Dr Sharples.</p>
