<p><strong>1 nation, 2 days, 6 cities, 40 signs of change</strong></p>
<p>Modern technology is enabling 400 people in six cities to attend a national conference on emerging sustainability, without the need for travelling out of town or finding accommodation.</p>
<p>The Signs of Change national e-conference, is designed to provide the beneficial aspects of gathering to learn, present and discuss a topic, while reducing the negative impacts of travel, namely expense, time and emissions. It will be hosted in Christchurch on 15-16 November 2010 with live connections to venues in Dunedin, Wellington, Hamilton, Palmerston North and Auckland.</p>
<p>The conference is the brain-child of Associate Professor Susan Krumdieck, from the University of Canterbury’s Department of Mechanical Engineering.</p>
<p>“I was going to go to an international conference on sustainability in Europe, but it was going to be the same old thing – we must reduce our emissions, we must switch to renewables, we must get new economic theories – blah blah. I had the idea that with the funds I would have spent for one academic to go to one overseas conference I could host a national conference about a new direction.”</p>
<p>Dr Krumdieck put her idea to the Engineers for Social Responsibility and they agreed to support the event as their national conference. A network of academics volunteered time to work with their universities and IT specialists to set up the conference.</p>
<p>“The new HD323 bridge technology will be used for the first time to host a public event. The technology will allow participants in lecture theatres in six cities to see the speaker and view the PowerPoint slides from another city,” said Professor Krumdieck.</p>
<p>“The robust national dialogue via modern technology will be a sign of change in itself. There will also be locally made videos aired and discussion groups.”</p>
<p>“We are expecting at least 400 participants from around the country with an emissions savings of 22 tonnes of CO2 by attending locally while participating nationally,” she said.<br>The theme of the conference is <em>Signs of Change</em> and will showcase 40 presentations of fundamental change in a wide variety of contexts.</p>
<p>“We have not invited international experts to tell us how big the problems are, and what we must do – most of which we can’t do. The problems of unsustainable use of resources and impacts on the environment have been discussed at length in many forums. This national conference is a showcase for changes that are already emerging in a sustainable direction. We will learn about the future by hearing short reports from New Zealanders from all walks of life who are exploring in a positive direction.”</p>
<p>Professor Krumdieck said the conference was aimed at anyone who wants to know about initiatives in sustainability including engineers, scientists, business people, council workers, educators, students, health workers and farmers.</p>
<p>“The conference provides an opportunity to make connections, share ideas, and learn what others are doing.”</p>
<p>Professor Krumdieck said the conference organizers will be seeking feedback from participants and some of that information will be used in a research report about running an e-conference.</p>
<p>Registrations are now open and more information can be found on the conference website (<a href="http://www.signsofchange.org.nz">www.signsofchange.org.nz</a>) which Professor Krumdieck said cost the equivalent of two night’s accommodation in Vienna.</p>
