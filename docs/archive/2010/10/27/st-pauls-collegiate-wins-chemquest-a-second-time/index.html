<p><strong>St Paul’s Collegiate wins ChemQuest second year running</strong>  </p>
<p>St Paul’s Collegiate School has taken out the top prize for the second year running at the Waikato University ChemQuest. The school also won second place.</p>
<p>First place went to Andrew McPherson, Evan Wilson and Chang Zhai from the St Paul’s team called ‘Team’. The students were awarded the James and Wells trophy, $150 and a gold medal each.</p>
<p>The annual chemistry quiz gives Year 12 chemistry students the chance to put their chemistry knowledge to the test in a pop quiz-style challenge. The after-school event was held at the University of Waikato on October 20 and was attended by almost 200 students, made up of 66 teams of three.</p>
<p>St Paul’s Collegiate School also won second place in the contest. The team ‘Corrosive Carnage’ consisting of Lucien Nabbs, Mikey Hodge and James Kennedy, won $90 for their team and a silver medal each.</p>
<p>Third place was awarded to Hamilton Boys’ High School team ‘The Pros’: Bill Xu, Axton Pitt and Harry Yoon.</p>
<p>&quot;I think ChemQuest is one of the highlights of the year - for both the organisers and the participants - and it&#39;s great to see students travelling from all over the region to participate,&quot; says event organiser Professor Bill Henderson.</p>
<p>ChemQuest is sponsored by the University of Waikato’s Faculty of Science and Engineering, James &amp; Wells Intellectual Property and Hill Laboratories.  </p>
