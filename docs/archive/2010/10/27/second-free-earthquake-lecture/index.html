<p>Second Free Earthquake Lecture</p>
<p>In response to public demand, the University of Canterbury is giving residents another opportunity to attend a free lecture by geologist Dr Mark Quigley.</p>
<p>A lecture on campus last week was attended by 600 people, with several hundred more being turned away. Next week&#39;s lecture will be held in the James Hay Theatre at the Town Hall, which can accommodate about 1,000 people.</p>
<p>It will consider how the 4 September earthquake occurred and why the fault line responsible for it was not known before now. Dr Quigley, who has had a high media profile in the weeks since the earthquake, will also discuss aftershocks and when they might stop; what has been learnt from the earthquake; and the likelihood of another major earthquake in the Canterbury region.</p>
<p>The free lecture will be held on Tuesday 2 November between 6.00pm and 7.30pm in the James Hay Theatre, and will replace the scheduled UC in the City lecture at the Christchurch Art Gallery.</p>
<p>Residents who have a question they would like to be considered for discussion on the night should email <a href="mailto:myquestion@canterbury.ac.nz">myquestion@canterbury.ac.nz</a>.</p>
