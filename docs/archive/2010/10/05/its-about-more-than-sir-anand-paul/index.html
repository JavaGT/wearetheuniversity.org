<p><strong>It’s about more than Sir Anand, Paul</strong></p>
<p>Paul Henry still doesn’t seem to understand how his comments yesterday offended more than the Governor-General, Green Party human rights spokesperson Keith Locke said today.</p>
<p>Breakfast presenter Paul Henry this morning apologised for the comments he made yesterday about Governor-General Anand Satyanand. Mr Henry said Sir Anand Satyanand didn&#39;t ‘look or sound like a real New Zealander’.</p>
<p>“It isn’t just a matter of apologising to the Governor-General. Mr Henry’s comments have seriously offended the Indian community within New Zealand,” said Mr Locke.</p>
<p>“Paul Henry was denigrating hundreds of thousands of our citizens who are not of European or Māori origin, and to him don’t ‘look’ like real New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“Whether the TV host intended it or not, his racist stereotyping of who is or isn’t a real New Zealander encourages discrimination in employment and other areas of New Zealand life.</p>
<p>“TVNZ should also rethink its stance. The state broadcaster should stop promoting its Breakfast programme as a platform for bigotry.</p>
<p>“That is the only meaning that can be taken out of TVNZ’s defence of Mr Henry yesterday when its spokesperson said, ‘[Mr Henry] is prepared to say the things we quietly think but are scared to say out loud’.”</p>
