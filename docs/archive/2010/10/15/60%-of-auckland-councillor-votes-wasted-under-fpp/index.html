<p><strong>60% of votes for Auckland councillors wasted because of FPP</strong></p>
<p>The Auckland Council elections have resulted in hundreds of thousands of Aucklanders votes being wasted because the elections were run under the flawed first-past-the post system (FPP), said the Green Party today.</p>
<p>Across the Auckland Council, 62.5 percent of votes for councillors did not result in a representative being elected. On average it took only 37.5% of the vote to be elected as a councillor. In Albany it was only 20 percent.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of thousands of Aucklanders’ have been robbed of the power of their vote because of FPP,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>“The anti-MMP lobby groups want to take us back to FPP at the national level. They now seem to have the ear of John Key,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
<p>“FPP, in general elections, suits those who want to take power, but it is at the expense of fair representation.</p>
<p>“MMP gives all New Zealanders a say and is fair for everyone. We do not want to return to the FPP system where 60 percent of the vote can easily be wasted.</p>
<p>“Proportional representation systems are needed at the local and central government level to ensure that all people can have their say,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
