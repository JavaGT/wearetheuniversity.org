<p><strong>Ngā Whanaketanga Highlight Flawed Approach to National Standards</strong></p>
<p>The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa says the development of Ngā Whanaketanga Rumaki Māori highlights the government’s flawed approach to National Standards in mainstream schools.</p>
<p>The government says the consultation over Ngā Whanaketanga - National Standards for Māori medium schools - has been positive and constructive and parents, whanau, teachers and principals welcome their introduction.</p>
<p>NZEI agrees that the process has been positive because unlike National Standards, Ngā Whanaketanga have been trialled and have a direct connection to the curriculum.</p>
<p>NZEI Matua Takawaenga Laures Park says whānau and teachers have been able to have some real input into the development of Ngā Whanaketanga and there has been opportunity to make changes and refinements to ensure they will actually support student learning.</p>
<p>“The process over Ngā Whanaketanga speaks volumes over what can be achieved when schools and communities work together with the Ministry of Education in partnership. It’s a pity the government hasn’t taken the same approach with mainstream National Standards.”</p>
<p>“We believe Ngā Whanaketanga will support learning for Māori-medium students but the reality is the vast majority of Māori students are in mainstream schools and they are being subjected to untrailled and hastily introduced National Standards which have no Māori world view, have been rejected by Māori educators around the country and could label Māori children as failures.”</p>
<p>NZEI believes it’s not too late for the government to take the positive lessons from the development of Ngā Whanaketanga and apply them to National Standards.</p>
<p>ENDS  </p>
