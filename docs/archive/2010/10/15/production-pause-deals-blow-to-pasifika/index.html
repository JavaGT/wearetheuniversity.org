<p>Production “pause” Deals Blow To Pasifika Teaching And Learning</p>
<p>The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa says a decision to halt production of Pacific Island reading materials penalises Pasifika students and undermines the value of bi-lingual education.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education says it is “pausing” production of the TUPU Pasifika language series from the end of this year. The TUPU series is a set of Pacific language readers for beginners in a range of Pacific languages which contribute to bi-lingual education programmes in schools.</p>
<p>Research shows that students who have strong literacy in their own language have greater success in literacy in English. Bi-lingualism has also been identified as a major contributor to the overall academic success of Pasifika students in New Zealand schools.</p>
<p>“These readers are an effective learning resource which not only promote bi-lingual literacy but also respect the value of Pacific languages and cultures,” says NZEI President Frances Nelson.</p>
<p>“By having reading material in their own languages, Pasifika children can access the curriculum and establish good learning habits. Being strong and confident in their own language builds a foundation for their future learning and literacy.”</p>
<p>“It is ironic that the government is removing a resource which can actually make a difference to student learning while it continues to spend millions on a flawed and unproven system of National Standards which schools and parents know will do nothing to lift the achievement of Pasifika children,” says Ms Nelson.<br>NZEI is calling on the government to review its decision and show some commitment to Pasifika students and their learning by resuming production of the TUPU series.<br>ends</p>
