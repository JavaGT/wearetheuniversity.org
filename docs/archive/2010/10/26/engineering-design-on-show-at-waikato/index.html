<p><strong>Engineering design on show at Waikato</strong>  </p>
<p>A single-seater, battery-powered electric vehicle was just one of the outstanding engineering design projects on show recently at the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>The Carter Holt Harvey Pulp &amp; Paper Engineering Design Show gave Waikato University engineering students from years two, three and four the opportunity to showcase their prototypes. The students also presented posters detailing their designs and gave short talks on their research projects which were marked by Waikato University lecturers.</p>
<p>Associate Dean of Engineering Professor Janis Swan says the October 19 and 20 show was great. “The students scrubbed up nicely and did themselves proud, both in their research presentations and talking about their design projects. I had many compliments from the general public about how interesting the displays and posters were, and also on the quality of the students’ work.”</p>
<p>A Highly Commended award for Best Design Project went to Ali Hassan, Kiel Mans, Ryan Foote, Campbell Upperton and Sean Taylor for their single-seater battery powered electric vehicle.</p>
<p>An Excellence Award for the Best Design Project was presented to Matt Baird for his poster on Tail Water Depression at Maraetai 1 Hydro Station. His project looked at using compressed air to remove water from a runner chamber and draft tube in a hydro generation turbine.</p>
<p>The award for Best Process Design Project was given to Peter Betschart, Ian Laing and Timothy Walmsley for their project on Closed Loop Spray Drying in Industrial Milk Powder Plants.</p>
<p>Professor Swan says many organisations and firms are very supportive of the show, such as Carter Holt Harvey Pulp &amp; Paper; the Waikato IPENZ branch and DriVap Ltd, a local company. “The prize for the year two design project came from Young Engineering Students, the student engineering branch at Waikato.”</p>
