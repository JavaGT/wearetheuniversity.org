<p><strong>MP Calls on Hunters to Positively Identify their Targets</strong></p>
<p>Rotorua MP Todd McClay has said that the tragic death of Lower Hut Teacher Rosemary Ives near Turangi on Friday is a reminder to all firearms users to positively identify their target and use the highest degree of judgement when hunting.</p>
<p>Mr McClay said that he fully supports the comments of New Zealand Deer Stalkers Association (NZDA) President Alec McIver who is a strong advocate of safe hunting practices.</p>
<p>“It is imperative that hunters identify their target and don’t spotlight. The death of Mrs Ives would not have happened if firearm safety rules had been correctly followed,” Mr McClay said.</p>
<p>“The Bay of Plenty region has many rewarding hunting areas. As an occasional hunter and member of NZDA I know first-hand the importance of sound firearm practices. I call on all hunters to positively identify their targets, to be aware that there are many recreational users in our forests, and follow NZ’s fire arms safety rules carefully” he said.</p>
<p>Mr McClay said that he believed that the majority of hunters do adhere strictly to gun rules, however it is important that when using a firearm people remember the harm that can be caused if they are not used safely.</p>
<p>“My thoughts are with the family, friends and students of Rosemary Ives. This will be an extremely difficult time for them” Mr McClay said.</p>
