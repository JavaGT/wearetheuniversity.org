<p><strong>Friday, 29 October 2010, 12:00 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>New Zealand First Annual Convention</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First will hold its annual convention in Christchurch this weekend, (30/31 October)</p>
<p>The theme of the convention will be “Putting New Zealand First” and it will focus on party policy and strategy to return New Zealand First MPs to Parliament at the 2011 General Election.</p>
<p>“Our policies are needed more than ever before,” said Mr. Peters. “It is time to end New Zealand&#39;s slavish adherence to orthodox free market policies, which are throwing thousands of people out of work and sending exporters to the wall.</p>
<p>“This country has gone from greatness to mediocrity in one generation under the leadership of both National and Labour and our policies and commitment comprise the only hope for New Zealand to become great again.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters said there are many “excellent” remits to be discussed at the convention on many of the critical issues facing New Zealand today.</p>
<p>“We will give these remits our urgent attention whilst knowing that much policy discussion lies ahead in preparation for the 2011 campaign.”</p>
<p>The convention is being held at the Latimer Hotel, 30 Latimer Square, Christchurch<br>Saturday 30 October 9am – 4.30pm<br>Sunday 31 October 9am – 3.15pm</p>
<p>ENDS  </p>
