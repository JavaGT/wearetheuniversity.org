<p>New Zealand Food Awards announced</p>
<p>A meal option that combines fresh produce with pre-packaged ease won the Massey University Supreme Award at this year’s New Zealand Food Awards.</p>
<p>The award was presented at a gala dinner last night at the Langham Hotel in Auckland.</p>
<p>The quinoa, mushroom and roast vegetable ready-meals, made by Auckland’s Tasty Pot Company, were chosen ahead of more than 90 overall entries. The product was also named winner of the Zespri Award for Innovation in Food Products and winner of the convenience and meal solutions award.</p>
<p>The judging panel, led by chef and food critic Ray McVinnie, said they could not have made a better or fresher meal themselves. “High quality raw ingredients combined with minimal processing made the Tasty Pots a colourful, healthy, great tasting and convenient meal solution.”</p>
<p>University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says supporting the food and beverage industry through the awards is vitally important to the University. “Our primary industries, and the food and beverage sector in particular, are the cornerstone of the New Zealand economy,” Mr Maharey says. “We feed around 20 million people, but with the world population likely to reach nine billion, our aim has to be to lift this production dramatically from the current $23 billion in export to more than $40 billion over the next 10 years. We believe that this will only come through innovation driven by partnership between the University and industry.”</p>

<p>The KPMG Food Enterprise Award was presented to the Havelock North Fruit Company. The judging for this award was overseen by representatives from KPMG, who said the winner had identified a market niche for the product and found strategic partners that align with that niche. “There is excellent &#39;grower to consumer&#39; control of the product and appropriate intellectual property protection.”</p>
<p>The Kaweka Food Company won the New Zealand Food Safety Authority Operations Innovation Award for its lamb shank with rosemary and red wine sauce. The judges said the product held up well to rigorous testing. “Kaweka Foods have managed the retort process – cooking after the product has been sealed – so the foods are not only shelf-stable, but look good and have great flavour and texture.”</p>
<p>The Heart Foundation Tick Healthier Choice Award was won by 100 Percent Nutz Ltd for its peanut butter. The judges mentioned that it is difficult to achieve an acceptable tasting product, with no added salt, that will meet consumer demands; “however 100 Percent Nuts has achieved great flavour and texture using no additional ingredients other than high quality peanuts”.</p>
<p>The Food and Grocery Council Grocer’s Choice Award was won by Te Horo Foods for its range of jams. “Just like Grandma used to make – these products have the full flavour of 50 per cent fruit and 50 per cent sugar, no additives and are batch-processed to retain intense colour, identifiable pieces of fruit and true-to-fruit flavour. These products could grace the shelves of any pantry masquerading as home-made,” the judges said.</p>
<p>“This year’s entrants in the New Zealand Food Awards have all demonstrated innovation in some way, and the best products have invariably kept things simple,” Mr McVinnie said. “My fellow judges and I have been impressed and surprised by the quality of entrants in this year’s awards. They are proof that New Zealand food producers and exporters are finding new and exciting ways to prepare and sell the food grown and raised here in New Zealand.”</p>
<p>The awards identify the best food products, with categories from dairy products and convenience to food business. The Tasty Pot Company, along with tonight’s other winners, will be able to display the Food Awards mark, to differentiate the product on shelves as being of nationally recognised quality.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Food Awards are made possible by the support of principal sponsor Massey University, and supporting sponsors KPMG, the Riddet Institute, the Heart Foundation, AsureQuality, O-I New Zealand, and the New Zealand Institute of Food Science and Technology.</p>
