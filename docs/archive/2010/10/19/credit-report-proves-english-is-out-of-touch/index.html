<p><strong>Credit report proves English is out of touch</strong></p>
<p>Latest statistics from the country&#39;s largest credit bureau --- showing a massive hike in the number of Kiwis who can’t pay their bills and 50 percent of trading companies with outstanding debts --- proves how out of touch Bill English is when he says Kiwis are better off under National, says Labour Finance spokesperson David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“Veda Advantage’s report is a huge wake-up call,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“The reason New Zealanders are spending less is not because they are saving --- it’s because they can’t afford to pay the bills they already have.</p>
<p>“According to Veda, about half the country’s trading companies --- 336,716 --- have outstanding debt, with more than $12 million overdue by 90 to 120 days. Veda says these debts are likely to be written off, with a severe impact on creditors and ultimately a further negative impact on business and the wider economy.”</p>
<p>David Cunliffe said the statistics provided more evidence that the economy had stalled under National.</p>
<p>“The NZIER Survey of Business Opinion on 5 October showed the New Zealand economy in reverse, with a collapse of business activity, and followed a day after Berl’s report that warned of risks of a double dip recession.</p>
<p>“The Veda report helps explain why business turnover is down, businesses are not hiring, and businesses are not investing,” David Cunliffe said</p>
<p>&quot;Just as alarmingly, tens of thousands of New Zealanders are finding they just can&#39;t pay their bills.</p>

<p>“As Veda says, these Kiwis are going into arrears and then finding their credit record is affected as defaults stay on credit reports for five years.</p>
<p>“For Bill English to say Kiwis are better off under National represents the ultimate in cynicism,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“It’s a bit rich for Bill English to claim credit for ‘controlling’ inflation when he has presided over the deepest recession in many years, and failed to provide a plan to lead us out of it.</p>
