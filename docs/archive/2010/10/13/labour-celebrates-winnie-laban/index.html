<p>12 October 2010 Media Statement</p>
<p>Labour celebrates Winnie Laban</p>
<p>Labour Leader Phil Goff today joined with his colleagues to celebrate the career of Luamanuvao Winnie Laban and wish her well for her future at Victoria University,</p>
<p>&quot;Winnie has dedicated her life to promoting Pasifika people and her position at Victoria University will enable her to continue this work,&quot; Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>&quot;Winnie has poured her heart into working for the Mana electorate and I know she will put the same energy, commitment and passion into helping Pasifika students at Victoria University.</p>
<p>&quot;Winnie&#39;s new role will see her concentrating on lifting the achievement and aspiration of Pasifika students, something that Labour fully supports.&quot;</p>
<p>Phil Goff today also announced that Su&#39;a William Sio would take over as Labour&#39;s Pacific Island Affairs and Interfaith spokesperson.</p>
<p>&quot;I know William will bring with him the same passion and commitment that Winnie brought to the roles.</p>
<p>&quot;Winnie has been a fantastic role model, and when elected to Parliament in 1999 was the first female Pacific MP and while in Government achieved the position of Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, a position I know she loved.</p>
<p>&quot;Her contribution to caucus will be missed. But I know her colleagues here in Parliament look forward to seeing her succeed in the same way she did here,&quot; Phil Goff said.</p>
