<p>Pioneering Japanese links with Christchurch commemorated at Lincoln University</p>
<p>The patron of Christchurch’s Festival of Japan and the first Japanese student to study at Lincoln University, the late Dr Isamu Kawase, is having his life and work commemorated with the unveiling of a plaque on his old campus today (Wednesday 20 October).</p>
<p>Dr Kawase, born in Nishinomiya, Japan, in January 1908, came to Lincoln University, then known as Canterbury Agricultural College, in 1931. He chose the College on the recommendation of the daughter of the Bishop of Christchurch, Rt. Rev. Campbell West-Watson, who was in Japan at a Pacific Congress at the same time as the young Kawase was keen to learn about sheep farming.</p>
<p>While a student in New Zealand Isamu Kawase came under the care of Sir Cyril Ward, son of former Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward, and himself a former CAC student.</p>
<p>Isamu Kawase completed a Diploma in Agriculture and returned to Japan in 1934 to pursue a career in agronomy, grasslands research, teaching and consultancy. He received a Doctor of Agricultural Science degree from Hokkaido University, co-founded the Japanese Society of Grassland Science, and was a recipient of Japan’s Grassland Scientist of the Year award.</p>
<p>An abiding affection for New Zealand led him to co-found the New Zealand Society of Japan, promoting relationships between the two countries. He maintained regular contact with Christchurch and Lincoln University over the years, visiting the city some 20 times. He was invited to be Patron of the city’s Festival of Japan, the premier local Asian event before the advent of the Lantern Festival.</p>

<p>For his services to New Zealand he was made an Honorary Member of the Queen’s Service Order in 1979.</p>
<p>Dr Kawase died in Christchurch in August 1999 after attending the final night of that year’s Festival of Japan, in which an orchestral suite he composed was played by the Christchurch School of Music Sinfonia.</p>
<p>The plaque at Lincoln University commemorating Dr Kawase is being unveiled by the Japanese Consul in Christchurch, Mr Shoichi Kawai. Members of Dr Kawase’s family have travelled from Japan and North America for the occasion.</p>
