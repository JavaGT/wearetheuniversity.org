<p>**Mother’s cry: Shame on John Key<br>**<br>When a Tongan mother at today’s <em>Fairness at Work</em> rally cried out ‘shame on John Key’, she was reflecting the struggle of thousands of Pacific workers and families, says Labour’s Pacific Island Affairs spokesperson Su’a William Sio.</p>
<p>Su’a William Sio congratulated Mele Peaua, representing cleaners and the Service and Food Workers Union at the rally in Parliament grounds, for speaking out against what she called John Key’s ‘bad laws’.</p>
<p>“I also want to congratulate all other Pacific workers who turned out at the rallies today.</p>
<p>“Many workers, including many other Pacific mothers, are being forced to do two or three jobs, and they are barely able to pay for the basic necessities,” Su’a William Sio said.</p>
<p>“John Key’s labour laws --- including the extended 90-day provision and the blocking of access to union officials --- are, as Mele Peaua says, bad laws.</p>
<p>“These laws will make it even harder for workers and families like Mele’s,” Su’a William Sio said. “These laws are a throwback to the draconian laws National introduced in the 1990s.</p>
<p>“I hope every Pacific worker joins the unions and gets involved in these protests.</p>
<p>“This is a good fight because it is a fight for basic human rights. Workers deserve higher incomes and better jobs. They do not deserve to be treated with such disdain by this Government.</p>
<p>“Shame on John Key,” Su’a William Sio said.</p>
