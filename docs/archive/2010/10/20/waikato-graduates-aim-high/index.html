<p>Nanaia Mahuta<br><strong>MP for Hauraki Waikato</strong>  </p>
<p>20 October 2010 <strong>Media Statement</strong><br><strong>Waikato Graduates Aim High</strong></p>
<p>I am pleased to congratulate the graduates of Waikato University who will be receiving their degrees over the next two days said local Hauraki-Waikato MP Nanaia Mahuta</p>
<p>The first graduation took place today at Te Kohinga Marae, Waikato University followed by a graduation on Thursday 21st October at Founders Theatre.</p>
<p>I was particularly delighted to see the high number of international students receiving their awards at the Maori graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>Waikato University holds a unique position amongst other institutions as it is situated in a region where the rich cultural canvass offered by tribes from Tainui, Maatatua, Te Arawa, Taakitumu and other waka are reflected.</p>
<p>There is an emerging diversity which presents itself at the university which also contributes to the quality of the community of learning at Waikato University.</p>
<p>I am mindful that the University has had to limit its student enrolment numbers and I hope it doesn&#39;t affect the number of Maori who want to get a higher qualification.</p>
<p>The Minister needs to be mindful that the emerging profile of NZs population is more polynesian than ever before and our people want to excel in education to lift their opportunities for the future.</p>
<p>I congratulate the students who have worked hard to graduate today, the staff of the University who are critical to successful outcomes and most importantly the families and partners of students for the important role they have to support success.</p>
<p>I wish them all well in this difficult climate and trust that they will reap the rewards of their educational pursuit.</p>
