<p><strong>Wednesday, 20 October 2010, 1:01 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>20 October 2010 <strong>Media Statement</strong><br><strong>Rallies a protest against anti-worker and anti-Kiwi government</strong></p>
<p>Today’s nationwide day of action reflects the anger of tens of thousands of Kiwis at the Government’s co-ordinated process to drive down pay and conditions for wage and salary earners, says the Labour Party’s labour spokesperson Trevor Mallard.</p>
<p>“It’s the exact opposite of what National promised before the election,” Trevor Mallard said.</p>
<p>“National promised to close the wage gap with Australia. Instead, we have fallen much further behind, and National is set on a relentless path to drive down conditions as well.”</p>
<p>Trevor Mallard congratulated the Council of Trade Unions (CTU) for organising the Fairness at Work rallies across the country.</p>
<p>“The CTU has done the organising, but it is the Government’s oppressive and harsh policies that are providing the inspiration for Kiwi workers across the country to unite in protest.</p>
<p>“Policies like the 90-day clause, obstacles placed in the way of wage and salary earners gaining access to union officials, the taking away of meal and tea breaks, and the loss of a fourth week’s holiday are all part of a wider picture of a government committed to looking after its wealthy mates, but unconcerned about low and middle-income Kiwis,” Trevor Mallard said.</p>
<p>“These policies are not only anti-worker, but anti-New Zealand as well, because the economic recovery of New Zealand depends upon hard-working Kiwis who are increasingly struggling to make ends meet.”</p>
