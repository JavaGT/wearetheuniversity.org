<p><strong>Universities welcome additional funding for more student places</strong></p>
<p>Universities New Zealand – Te Pōkai Tara (Universities NZ) welcomes the government’s announcement to invest more money into university student places for 2011 and 2012. This decision is in accord with what universities have been pointing to for some time – that investment in university education and research is central to New Zealand&#39;s future growth.</p>
<p>University graduates enter the workforce highly skilled and prepared to take on the increasingly complex problems we face. They earn higher salaries and contribute disproportionately to government revenues.</p>
<p>In addition, universities are key contributors to New Zealand&#39;s research, science and technology sector. They employ over half the country&#39;s research staff, have the bulk of its fundamental research capability and train nearly all its postgraduate students - the researchers and professionals of the future that the country will rely upon to drive innovation and productivity.</p>
<p>“We appreciate that the government has taken this step to invest in educational opportunities at our universities, even though their budget is constrained,” says Derek McCormack, Chair of Universities NZ. “The additional funding over the next two years will alleviate some of the financial pressure our institutions are facing from the high demand for student places.”</p>
<p>Beyond the significant economic returns that taxpayers get from their investment in universities, universities provide equally important social and cultural returns to the country.</p>
<p>&quot;Universities are uniquely placed to contribute to a better future for New Zealand. We are committed to continuing to work in partnership with the government to achieve these goals,&quot; concludes McCormack.</p>
