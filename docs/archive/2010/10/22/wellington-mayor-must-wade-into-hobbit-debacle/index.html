<p><strong>Friday, 22 October 2010, 12:16 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Young_Nationals">New Zealand Young Nationals</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Wellington Mayor must wade into Hobbit debacle</strong>  </p>
<p>Wellington Mayor Cecil Wade-Brown is being called upon to come clean on where she stands on the Hobbit film being filmed here, says Young Nats President Daniel Fielding.</p>
<p>&quot;Mayor Wade-Brown is a member of the Green party and has actively campaigned on behalf of Equity. She has announced to Wellington circles that she supports the Equity Union and the Council of Trade Unions who have moved to block the US$500 million film being made here,&#39; said Mr Fielding.</p>
<p>&quot;Its time Mayor Wade-Brown put Wellington jobs ahead of party policy.</p>
<p>&quot;The Hobbit is likely to bring millions of dollars and thousands of jobs to Wellington in a time of economic uncertainty. The Mayor must advocate on behalf of Wellingtonians who are set to lose their livelihoods.</p>
<p>&quot;We demand Mayor Wade-Brown come clean and disclose all the meetings she has had with Equity and what she&#39;s done to ensure this film goes ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;The Mayor is acting more like Smaug the Dragon defending her treasure, than the Mayor of Wellington.</p>
<p>&quot;This film is crucial to the New Zealand film industry and Wellington jobs. Without the Hobbit, we might even lose Weta Workshop in Miramar.</p>
<p>&quot;Mayor Wade-Brown is a self-declared Green Party member – the Young Nats will be watching closely to ensure she puts the interests of her constituents above her bid to become a Green MP.</p>
<p>&quot;Those 40 people in film who voted for Mayor Wade-Brown might be reconsidering their moves in light of the Mayor&#39;s odd stance,&quot; said Mr Fielding.</p>
