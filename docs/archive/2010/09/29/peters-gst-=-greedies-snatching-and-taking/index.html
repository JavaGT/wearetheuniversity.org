<p><strong>EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt. Hon Winston Peters</strong><br><strong>Leader NZ First</strong></p>
<p><strong>“GST = Greedies Snatching And Taking”</strong></p>
<p>PUBLIC MEETING<br>The Lodge, Grahamstown Community Centre, Pollen St, Thames<br>Wednesday 29th September 2010, 10.15AM</p>
<p>In three days time you are going to get a surprise that all the media are talking about.</p>
<p>GST, a consumption tax, will rise to 15%, near the very highest consumer tax in the whole</p>
<p>wide world and yet just 2 years ago, when you voted, no one warned you about it.</p>
<p>GST used to be called the “Goods and Services Tax”.</p>
<p>It should be renamed.</p>
<p>It should be called the “Greedies Snatching and Taking Tax”.</p>
<p>October 1st marks a dark day in New Zealand&#39;s social and economic history.</p>
<p>It is the start of an era during which there will be massive redistribution of wealth in this country.</p>
<p>The money will be taken from people on middle and low incomes and given to those at the top of the pile.</p>
<p>These changes solely benefit people on high incomes.</p>
<p>People of considerable means, like National&#39;s most loyal supporters.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s call them the “greedies”.</p>
<p>Hardest hit will be pensioners and lower income families, especially Maori, Polynesians and many European families who already lag behind the rest of the community.</p>
<p>In a country which once prided itself on equality of opportunity and taking responsibility for looking after its citizens, October 1st will become another day of shame.</p>

<p>Whatever they tell you about everyone being better off after the tax cuts and GST increase, take it with a bag of salt.</p>
<p>The facts are,</p>
<p>The government will collect the same amount of tax.</p>
<p>Tax cuts will be on a sliding scale, and they will really kick in for people on $100,000 or more.</p>
<p>Someone on a hundred thousand a year will get about $70 a week extra and the prime minister will get about $300 a week more.</p>
<p>That&#39;s just on his parliamentary salary alone.</p>
<p>Now remember the same amount of tax is being collected.</p>
<p>And, people on high incomes are getting big tax cuts – so the laws of logic say that the money must come from somewhere for these tax cuts. Someone has to pay for it.</p>
<p>Guess where? – and guess who?</p>
<p>Mr Key&#39;s pay increase will be paid for by groups like pensioners.</p>
<p>They get a small rise in one hand – but on the other hand pay out a lot extra in GST, increased power prices, increased rates, increased government charges like car licenses, insurance – increased everything.</p>
<p>And don’t forget this important fact.</p>
<p>The Finance Minister has himself admitted that the increased government charges will add nearly six percent to the cost of living.</p>
<p>So when you add normal inflation on top of this – you are looking at price rises of probably eight or nine percent.</p>
<p>Pension levels will simply not keep up.</p>
<p>We have set a target of 72.5 percent of the net average wage as approaching a fair amount for superannuation.</p>
<p>The trouble is the way the net average after tax wage is calculated keeps changing.</p>
<p>It always changes downwards so in real terms the pension has been reducing over the years.</p>
<p>We have tried to push it up over the years and did manage to get 66 percent of the net average wage after the 2005 election.</p>
<p>However it is being eroded all the time and the changes taking effect on Friday will speed up this unfortunate process.</p>
<p>New Zealand First has always believed that governments should look after the most vulnerable in society.</p>
<p>We feel society has a special obligation to look after the very young and the elderly.</p>
<p>We do not subscribe to the belief of officialdom in Wellington that the elderly are a burden on society.</p>
<p>It caused us great concern to learn of a recent study that said many elderly people are risking malnutrition by not feeding themselves properly.</p>
<p>This study, commissioned by the Hawkes Bay District Health Board, suggested that these people either believe they don’t need much to eat or find it too hard to cook.</p>
<p>The study showed 57 per cent were at risk of developing malnutrition that could lead to losing their independence and increasing their chances of being put into hospital.</p>
<p>The highest risk factors were living alone and being Maori. That is in the Hawkes Bay.</p>
<p>Low incomes were also a factor.</p>
<p>This is serious. What has happened to us?</p>
<p>Why did we let this happen?</p>
<p>New Zealand First has already announced an extension of the SuperGold card for a free annual medical check for the elderly – the moment we are back in Parliament.</p>
<p>We are also capping the cost of a visit to a GP at ten dollars.</p>
<p>However, much more needs to be done and we will be working with organisations like Age Concern and GreyPower and health authorities to tackle problems like malnutrition.</p>
<p>It is obscene to give big tax cuts to the rich while some elderly people no longer eat properly.</p>
<p>Sometimes the solution can be simple – like neighbours looking out for each other.</p>
<p>We are sure that is happening but more needs to happen.</p>
<p>For a start the government should stop squeezing district health boards, and home help services that are being cut should be restored.</p>
<p>And let&#39;s take a long hard look at policies of bailing out finance companies that go down the gurgler owing Billions of dollars.</p>
<p>We oppose any system that ‘privatises profits and socialises losses’.</p>
<p>This government has been very selective about whom it helps.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of elderly people lost their life savings when companies like Blue Chip went under.</p>
<p>Some even lost their homes because of shonky deals set up by finance companies.</p>
<p>The whole business climate has been tainted.</p>
<p>And where was the Serious Fraud Office when ordinary people were losing their life savings?</p>
<p>Getting perversely involved in politics – that’s where!</p>
<p>Hopefully things will be different now that there have been staff changes at the SFO.</p>
<p>But don’t hold your breath. This government is not serious about white collar crime.</p>
<p>And while we are on the subject of greedies snatching and taking.</p>
<p>The foreshore and seabed around the Coromandel will be up for grabs over the next few months.</p>
<p>National and the Maori Party have decided against the Crown, that is you and I, owning the foreshore and seabed, on behalf of all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>No, this priceless asset will be available for transfer into private customary title.</p>
<p>There will be nothing we can do about it.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation says it can be sorted out through the courts or by direct negotiation.</p>
<p>In other words – the courts will be clogged up for generations, or the foreshore and seabed will be handed over in a deal sorted out behind closed doors.</p>
<p>There will be no guaranteed access for New Zealanders of all ethnic backgrounds and most Maori will miss out as well.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with the present law. It is fair to everybody.</p>
<p>It allows the historical rights of Maori but outright ownership is with all of us.</p>
<p>This government has gone far too far and we will sort out the mess again when we return to parliament next year.</p>
<p>There is one group of greedies whom I have saved for last. The people who sell our land to foreigners and the politicians who let them.</p>
<p>These greedies and their political yes men are involved in selling our birthright, our sovereignty to foreigners who don’t give a damn about what happens to this country.</p>
<p>This week the government announced the results of a review into selling priceless assets to overseas interests and guess what?</p>
<p>Despite all the rhetoric and bluster from John Key they are actually making it easier for foreigners to buy our land.</p>
<p>No laws are being changed – just a bit of nudge, nudge, wink, wink.</p>
<p>On the day National faked a change to the law, on Monday, the OIO approved Shanghai based Bright Dairy’s purchase of over half of Sinlait Milk for $82 Million.</p>
<p>So National’s announcement is merely a few more hypocritical soothing noises to keep you natives under control.</p>
<p>All the overseas buyers now have to do is appoint a local director.</p>
<p>That&#39;s right, a traitorous puppet who&#39;ll do the bidding of his foreign masters.</p>
<p>Nobody with a jot of commonsense or patriotism was allowed into this review process.</p>
<p>They were all National stooges or Treasury boffins who have long shed any semblance of loyalty to their country.</p>
<p>They are economic traitors who do not care if their fellow citizens are reduced to the status of landless peasants.</p>
<p>History is very cruel to political leaders who sell their nations&#39; heritage for the historical thirty<br>pieces of silver.</p>
<p>And speaking of next year – there has been a lot of media speculation about where the Leader of New Zealand First will stand in the general election.</p>
<p>Some commentators are already describing the make up of the next government.</p>
<p>Let me put the record straight.</p>
<p>No selection decisions have been made about where candidates will stand.</p>
<p>The party makes these decisions – not Winston Peters.</p>
<p>We had not considered targeting John Key in Helensville.</p>
<p>We were told about that by a television reporter.</p>
<p>As we were about Epsom which surely needs an MP.</p>
<p>Politics is not like “Dancing with the Stars”.</p>
<p>You might get away with dropping a dancer on her head in a television programme but it&#39;s another thing to drop a whole electorate on their heads.</p>
<p>And it&#39;s another thing to privatise a city and ignore the concerns of the people who live there.</p>
<p>One MP left parliament because he stole the identity of a dead child.</p>
<p>Another MP from the same party is going to leave because he stole the identities of four cities and three districts!</p>
<p>On the other hand, New Zealand First is going to come back at the next election because we have policies that are not extreme at either end of the scale.</p>
<p>We believe in a fair go for everyone and we don’t subscribe to the “dog eat dog” mentality that prevails in the upper echelons of New Zealand politics today..</p>
<p>We don’t believe in those holding power and their supporters being the biggest beneficiaries of the political system.</p>
<p>We are resolved to put things right.</p>
<p>All we ask of you is the chance to do so.</p>
