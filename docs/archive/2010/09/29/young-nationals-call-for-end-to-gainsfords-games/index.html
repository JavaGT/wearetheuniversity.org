<p><strong>Wednesday, 29 September 2010, 10:10 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Young_Nationals">New Zealand Young Nationals</a></strong></p>
<p>Young Nationals call for End to Gainsford’s Games</p>
<p>The New Zealand Young Nationals are concerned at PPTA President, Kate Gainsford’s latest threats of lockouts and strikes that seek to undermine the educational quality that our students deserve.</p>
<p>Announcements by Gainsford yesterday of the potential for lockouts in conjunction with eight planned strikes in term four will damage the achievement and opportunities of New Zealand students.</p>
<p>“The politically-motivated games being played by Kate Gainsford and the PPTA are a disgraceful attempt to undermine the government’s solutions to providing quality education for all students and must end”, says Young Nats Vice President, Zach Castles.</p>
<p>“It’s time for Gainsford and the PPTA to acknowledge that their agenda is putting the education of thousands of young New Zealanders at risk.”</p>
<p>We need to honour the work and energy that good teachers contribute to education which transforms and grows the minds of thousands of New Zealand students every day.</p>
<p>“We are appealing to the PPTA to acknowledge that all New Zealanders are behind them in providing quality education to students, we have a government that is willing and enthusiastic to work for an outcome that safeguards and protects the futures and opportunities of young New Zealanders”.</p>
