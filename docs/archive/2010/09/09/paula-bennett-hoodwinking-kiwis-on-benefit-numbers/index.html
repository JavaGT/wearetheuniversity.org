<p>**Paula Bennett hoodwinking Kiwis on benefit numbers<br>**</p>
<p>Social Development and Employment Minister Paula Bennett continues to try to hoodwink the public about the number of people on benefits, Labour’s social development spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“In August, the same month that an additional 53,000 full time jobs were created in Australia, the number of people claiming benefits in New Zealand went up by 2133,” Annette King said.</p>
<p>“There are now 63,910 Kiwis on the unemployment benefit -- up 850 in a month -- and 336,333 on all main benefits.</p>
<p>“But instead of being upfront about the worsening situation or outlining a plan to fix it, Paula Bennett would rather issue dishonest media statements. Kiwis deserve better from their government.</p>
<p>“The latest statement was slipped out on Monday while all eyes were on the aftermath of the Canterbury earthquake.</p>
<p>“In that most recent misleading statement she said 6000 people had come off benefits in August.</p>
<p>“She failed to say however that the number of people that went onto all main benefits during August was more than 8800.</p>
<p>“She needs to put out the real facts so that New Zealanders can judge for themselves how her government is doing.</p>
<p>“Ms Bennett does not make the monthly summary of benefit statistics public. But it is released to the Parliamentary Library. The July and August reports are attached,&quot; Annette King said.</p>
