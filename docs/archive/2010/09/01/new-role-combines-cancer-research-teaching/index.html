<p><strong>New role combines cancer research, teaching and treatment</strong></p>
<p>Medical oncologist Bridget Robinson has been appointed to the newly established position of Mackenzie Chair in Cancer Medicine in the University of Otago, Christchurch.</p>
<p>The position is responsible for supporting cancer research at the University of Otago, Christchurch, and integrating research with Canterbury’s clinical services.</p>
<p>She will remain a medical oncologist, treating patients for half her time, but will now spend more time on research and teaching.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled to be appointed and raise the profile of cancer management and research in Christchurch,’’ Professor Robinson said.</p>
<p>“I will continue to be involved as an oncologist and researcher but will take on a bigger role of teaching both medical students and other health professionals about cancer.’’</p>
<p>“We have an ageing population and will have an increasing number of people with cancer so will need to look at innovative ways of delivering cancer care in our community.</p>
<p>The Chair in Cancer Medicine is only the second in the country.</p>
<p>Professor Robinson has been a medical oncologist in Canterbury since 1986.<br>In 1997 she joined the University of Otago, Christchurch, where she established its tissue bank.</p>
<p>Her research interest involves cancer biology and aspects of blood vessels relating to cancer which can be targeted for treatment.</p>
<p>Professor Robinson is already the chair of the Canterbury Cancer Network, which links scientists and clinicians managing cancer as well as community cancer support organisations, and the public.</p>

<p>“The Trustees, who are based in South Canterbury, recognised that supporting a new Chair in Cancer Medicine will benefit cancer patients, not only in Canterbury but throughout New Zealand. We are most grateful for the support they are providing.”</p>
<p>Professor Robinson’s appointment will be marked by a function at the University of Otago, Christchurch, at 5.15 pm on Thursday September 2.</p>
