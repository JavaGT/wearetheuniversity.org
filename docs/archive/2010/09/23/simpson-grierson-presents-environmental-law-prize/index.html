<p><strong>Simpson Grierson Presents Environmental Law Prize</strong> <strong>to University of Waikato Student</strong></p>
<p>21 September 2010: Tyler Buckley achieved the highest mark in the University of Waikato&#39;s environmental law paper this year. To secure the Simpson Grierson Environmental Law Prize for 2010, he went through an interview with the firm&#39;s judging panel. And clearly this Hamilton student impressed, earning himself the $1,000 award and the praise of Simpson Grierson chairman, Kevin Jaffe.</p>
<p>&quot;The Environmental Law Prize was established at the University of Waikato in 1992 to encourage excellence in the study of environmental law,&quot; said Mr Jaffe. &quot;Tyler Buckley is a deserving recipient, adding this prize to a number he has received at the University over the course of his study.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tyler was a Simpson Grierson Scholarship winner in 2009 and we look forward to welcoming him as a law graduate at the firm next year.&quot;</p>
<p>Tyler completes his conjoint degree in Law and Social Sciences (majoring in Economics) at the University of Waikato in 2011 and is currently on a student exchange to Denmark. He says that receiving the Simpson Grierson Environmental Law Prize was particularly meaningful to him.</p>
<p>&quot;I was motivated to study environmental law because of the time I spent as a summer clerk in the local government &amp; environment group at Simpson Grierson As a clerk, I received broad exposure to environmental law in practice and this made me want to learn more about the theory.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I like the fact that environmental law is very much community focused and as a result, is often the subject of media and political discussion. Whether it’s a historical building or a sustainable energy project, people will always have an opinion. As a summer clerk I learnt how prominent the issues can be, when I observed Environment Court proceedings one day and then read about them in the paper the next.&quot;</p>
<p>Tyler says he will put his prize money towards the purchase of a return flight to New Zealand next year, so that he can start work at Simpson Grierson in July. Something he says he is &quot;genuinely excited about&quot;.</p>
