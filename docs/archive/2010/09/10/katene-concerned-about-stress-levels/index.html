<p><strong>Katene concerned about stress levels</strong></p>
<p>Maori Party MP for Te Tai Tonga Rahui Katene has noticed that stress levels are increasing due to hardship experienced among Canterbury residents following the weekend&#39;s earthquake.</p>
<p>&quot;So far people have been fabulous - whanau with intact houses have opened their homes to their relatives and others, they&#39;ve been looking after them, feeding them and running them around,&quot; Mrs Katene said.</p>
<p>&quot;But constant worries about aftershocks, tiredness from lack of sleep and growing concerns about lack of money are beginning to take their toll. The need for appropriate psych-social support services is growing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Today I visited whanau at MSD and Housing New Zealand and I&#39;m impressed by their patience, understanding and coordinated approach with other government agencies and NGOs in dealing with this emergency. Their offices are full, yet they are endeavouring to help every person who comes in.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Katene also met with Ngai Tahu today who have been working with emergency and local services to help provide relief.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been moved by the generous support from other iwi, and their koha, and prayers for all the people of Canterbury. Iwi in Nelson have opened their marae to kaumatua and tamariki for time out away from the aftershocks. Another iwi in Blenheim has been coordinating donations from neighbouring iwi.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Katene was confident that generous offers like these will go a long way to help people deal with their stress.</p>
<p>&quot;My message to our people is to maintain and uphold those principles of manaakitanga and whanaungatanga. Continue to awhi one another through this trying time. Kia mau ki te aroha.&quot;</p>
