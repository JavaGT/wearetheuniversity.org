<p><strong>Saturday, 25 September 2010, 11:12 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_Students_Association">Auckland University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>VSM = bad for Auckland, bad for students</strong></p>
<p>AUSA condemns the Select Committee’s endorsement of the Act Party&#39;s Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill. The Bill would devastate students’ associations across the country and destroy services that provide students with support, representation and a community.</p>
<p>AUSA is the only voluntary association in the country, following a 1999 referendum in which students narrowly chose to adopt the model of voluntary student membership (VSM). Proponents of the Act Party Bill often hold up AUSA as a model for VSM.</p>
<p>“The reality actually shows that VSM is a disaster in practice, in Australia, Waikato University, and Unitec. AUSA has survived despite VSM, not because of it,” says AUSA President Elliott Blade.</p>
<p>“When AUSA went voluntary in 1999 we had to cut many services and staff. Students suffered under these cuts and we continue to be constrained in how we can effectively serve students’ needs and wants under a voluntary regime,” says Blade.</p>
<p>An NZUSA-commissioned economic analysis by PriceWaterhouseCoopers found that service levels would fall by between 48 and 73 percent under voluntary membership. In Australia, voluntary membership reduced fee income by more than 95 percent.</p>
<p>Such dramatic revenue losses in New Zealand would see massive reductions in services and facilities on campus and the loss of a student voice within institutions. For students, their experience on campus will be seriously diminished by this Bill.</p>
<p>“Most campuses around the country will bear the brunt of this Bill. AUSA’s situation is unique and is not replicated elsewhere. Our long history with the University, commercial assets built up under student ownership, and getting a contract for services allowed us to survive,” says AUSA Education Vice-President Alex Nelder.</p>
<p>“Our ability to provide independent and effective services has been drastically compromised. While we have been able to maintain services to some extent by entering into a contract for services with the University, our ability to be an independent student voice from the University has been irredeemably damaged,” says Nelder.</p>
<p>“Worst of all, students still pay. To provide the services we used to provide, the University of Auckland has one of the highest student services levies in the country. Students have no say over how high this fee is set, or where the money goes. The fee is much higher than at other campuses nationwide,” says Nelder.</p>
<p>“National has chosen to ignore our example which shows that VSM is a disaster in practice. National does not have to sacrifice students on the discredited ideological altar of the ACT Party . We urge the National Party to listen to the 98% of submissions against the Bill and reconsider,” concludes Mr Blade.</p>
