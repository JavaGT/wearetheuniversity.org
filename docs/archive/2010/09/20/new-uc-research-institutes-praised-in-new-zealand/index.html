<p><strong>New UC research institutes praised in New Zealand Universities Academic Audit</strong></p>
<p>The University of Canterbury’s statement of strategic intent and its establishment of two new research institutes have been praised in the latest New Zealand Universities Academic Audit.</p>
<p>The audit was carried out by the New Zealand Universities Academic Audit Unit (NZUAAU), an independent body set up by Universities New Zealand to support universities in their continuing achievement of standards of excellence in their academic responsibilities in research and teaching. It does this by conducting institutional audits on university campuses.</p>
<p>The current academic audit is part of the Cycle 4 round, which consists of full institutional audits of all New Zealand universities.</p>
<p>In its report the NZUAAU commended UC for its statement of strategic intent, its commitment to change and its willingness to consult widely about the implementation of the University’s vision.</p>
<p>“The panel was impressed by our engagement with staff when we set to develop our statement of strategic intent. The statement sets out the broad direction for the University for the next ten years to allow the University to evolve into a truly world-class learning environment,” said Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr.</p>
<p>UC was also commended for the establishment of the first two cross-disiplinary research institutes, the Biomolecular Interaction Centre and the New Zealand Institute of Language, Brain and Behaviour, which align with the research strengths and the new strategic direction of the university.</p>

<p>“We believe that hosting these two new multi-million dollar research institutes has the potential to raise our international profile and allow us to become widely known as offering a world-class learning environment,” said Dr Carr.</p>
<p>The NZUAAU also praised UC for its efforts to strengthen relationships and engage with stakeholders in education, industry and the service sector, he said.</p>
<p>Other areas of positive comment from the NZUAAU include the commitment of the staff in the Maori and Pacific Development team in their support of Maori and Pacific students during their transition to university, and for its programme of mentoring and pastoral care.</p>
<p>UC was also commended for its successful implementation of a common course size for all undergraduate degree classes and for the consequent benefits to students.</p>
<p>Dr Carr said that this had benefited students in two ways - by simplifying cross-transfer with a more flexible system and by allowing courses to be taken from another faculty.</p>
<p>“The continuing review of all courses to create a common course size (15 points) and identification of small enrolled taught courses are further initiatives to ensure effective use of resources. We are committed to preparing people to make a difference,” said Dr Carr.</p>
<p>Recommendations of the NZUAAU include some campus facilities need updating. This is being addressed with the release of the University’s master plan for a $1 billion investment in infrastructure at its Ilam campus over the next 20 years.</p>
<p>“We are moving towards creating a stimulating learning environment. The quality of our learning environment is also influenced by our facilities. We know that places where students and staff can work effectively, laboratories where they can experiment, and having modern technologies available, are essential,” said Dr Carr.</p>
<p>The NZUAAU panel commented on the need to attract more Maori and women academic staff, and the need to have a Maori plan. As part of the University’s restructuring, those concerns have been identified with a new high level position of Pro-Vice Chancellor (Maori). A Maori plan, with a proposed cultural facility, is in draft form.</p>
<p>The NZUAAU panel also commented on the structuring of the colleges, staff workloads, professional development, teaching and research nexus, and PhD supervision policy, which will be addressed when the restructuring process moves to the next step and looks closely at the colleges the processes and policies each college has in place.</p>
<p>“We are continually seeking to review the effectiveness and efficiency of our staff, students, teaching and research and to better understand how to assess and improve the way we teach and the environment that enables students to learn best,” said Dr Carr.</p>
<p>“The University has much to be proud of.”  </p>
