<p><strong>Canterbury’s future needs community input</strong></p>
<p>The local community must be consulted on the rebuilding of Christchurch and its surrounding areas, Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman said today.</p>
<p>Many buildings important to Canterbury’s heritage and local communities were damaged in Saturday’s earthquake and some have since been torn down.</p>
<p>“The Government has responded well so far to the events of Saturday,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“At present, making certain the traumatised population of Christchurch and its surrounding satellite towns are cared for is obviously the number one priority.</p>
<p>“However, looking ahead, Christchurch’s population need the chance to have input into what a post-quake Christchurch will look and feel like.</p>
<p>“This will mean - where possible - preserving iconic buildings important to local communities and building new urban structures that will complement Christchurch’s unique character.</p>
<p>“Decisions made in the next few weeks will shape the future of Christchurch for generations to come,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to working with the Government on developing a rebuilding strategy and ensuring that Cantabrians have full opportunity to contribute to that strategy.”</p>
<p>Christchurch-based Green Party MP Kennedy Graham is today visiting welfare centres.</p>
<p>Dr Graham yesterday told Parliament that there is an opportunity to ensure that any re-building programme reflects the very in sustainable building design and construction.</p>
