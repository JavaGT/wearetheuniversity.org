<p><strong>Government data shows universities performing at a high level</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand’s eight universities are performing at a high level according to data published by the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) today.</p>
<p>The tertiary sector’s educational performance indicators show that 84% of government funded university students successfully completed their courses, 82% continued with or completed their studies and 66% completed their qualifications last year.</p>
<p>“These results demonstrate that our universities are delivering value for money,” says Derek McCormack, Chair of Universities New Zealand–Te Pōkai Tara. “Not only is the expenditure on universities an efficient use of public money, but it’s also an investment that will pay back many times over, producing significant long-term economic, social and cultural returns to New Zealanders.”</p>
<p>While the information published today presents an overview of institutional performance in tertiary education, McCormack warns that using this data to rank universities in league tables would be a mistake.</p>
<p>There are many factors that influence these indicators on an institutional level. The part-time versus full-time mix, age, ethnicity and socio-economic background of students, as well as the types and lengths of courses or qualifications offered, all contribute to an institution’s results. The raw data that the TEC uses for these indicators does not adjust for any of these factors and is misleading if taken out of context.</p>
<p>For example, a university with a large number of part-time, older and extramural students may not perform as well on these indicators as a university with a more traditional student body. This is a reflection of the particular character of the university’s catchment rather than a reflection of the quality of the education it delivers.</p>
<p>“The universities accept that there must be accountability for the public funds they receive” says McCormack. “However, the data published today by the TEC only provides this information in the broadest sense. Other sources, such as the universities annual reports, provide more meaningful information.”</p>
