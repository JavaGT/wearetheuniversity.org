<p><strong>Friday, 3 September 2010, 4:29 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Come on Mr Key – bail these workers out too</strong>  </p>
<p>Labour MP Darien Fenton says that John Key and Bill English need to come to the rescue of the 100 workers at the Westin Hotel who have been sacked with no redundancy pay.</p>
<p>“These workers are the second group this week that are facing redundancy with no compensation, after being sacked through no fault of their own,” Darien Fenton said.</p>
<p>“Massey University cleaners, employed by OCS were given a reprieve from the Employment Court on Wednesday, but still face possible redundancy with no compensation.</p>
<p>“The harm these workers now face, with no job, bills to pay and a bleak job market could have been mitigated had the government been prepared to legislate for minimum redundancy entitlements and compensation when they had a chance earlier this year.</p>
<p>“Instead, the government wants to make it harder for workers to get another job by removing their rights with the 90 day trial period and unfair dismissal protection.</p>
<p>“It’s hard not to draw a comparison between the government’s urgent bail-out of South Canterbury Finance investors and their ignoring of the situation for these low paid workers.</p>
<p>“John Key needs to get his priorities right and do the right thing by these workers,” Darien Fenton said.</p>
