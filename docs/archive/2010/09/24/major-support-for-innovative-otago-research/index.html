<p>Major support from Marsden Fund for innovative Otago research</p>
<p>Friday 24 September 2010</p>
<p>University of Otago researchers have received major support from the prestigious Marsden Fund for a wide variety of innovative studies that will push the boundaries of current knowledge.</p>
<p>In the Fund s latest round, researchers from across the University s Divisions of Health Sciences, Humanities, and Sciences have gained $10.67M for 19 projects addressing unsolved questions in realms ranging from atomic physics to societal conflict resolution.</p>
<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research &amp; Enterprise) Professor Harlene Hayne welcomed the Marsden Fund s support for world-class research at Otago and warmly congratulated the University s latest successful applicants.</p>
<p>I am very proud of the researchers performance in this fiercely contested funding round. Nationally there was a record number of preliminary proposals submitted to the Marsden Fund. Less than one in ten of those proposals was eventually funded.’</p>
<p>Professor Hayne noted that for the sixth year running, the University of Otago has secured more Marsden funding than any other institution in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Once again, our researchers have demonstrated the world-class nature of the research that is conducted at the University of Otago. Their success reflects Otago s ongoing commitment to building and sustaining a strong research culture,’ Professor Hayne says.</p>
<p>Among the new Otago projects are studies aimed at gaining new understandings of the world around us, including investigations into the bizarre behaviour of ultra-cold atoms, the effects of magnetic storms on polar air temperatures, mechanisms involved in plant photosynthesis, and genetic diversity in endangered bird populations.</p>

<p>Biomedically-focused projects include studies into mechanisms underlying the spread of bacterial infection between cells, deadly cardiac arrhythmias in heart disease, drug resistance, brain control of human fertility, and the hormone-related neural basis of mood disorders in some new mothers.</p>
<p>Projects in both science and humanities are designed to glean important new insights into facets of human behaviour and in society, both past and present. Included are investigations into decision-making when embryos show genetic anomalies, improving the reliability of children s court testimony, and several studies focusing on gaining new knowledge about key aspects of societies and social interactions that are occurring now and in the past.</p>
<p>Professor Hayne says she is excited by the significant proportion of Fast-Start’ grants among the successful Otago projects.</p>
<p>Fast-Start awards are designed to support outstanding researchers early in their careers. These staff members promise to become the University s research leaders of tomorrow, and it is really exciting to see their potential recognised through these grants.’</p>
<p>Marsden grants are administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand and support research excellence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, social sciences and the humanities. This year, $60M was distributed among 13 institutions in New Zealand.</p>
