<p><strong>Student leaders convene for next steps</strong></p>
<p>Student leaders from universities and polytechnics around the country will converge in Palmerston North this week for the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) October Conference.</p>
<p>The Association of Students at UCOL(AS@U) will host the conference over three days between September 30 to October 2 at the Palmerston North Universal College of Learning(UCOL) campus.</p>
<p>“Student delegates from all around New Zealand will be considering the next steps with the Act Party’s Education(Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill, as well as current student issues in the tertiary environment, such as changes to student loans, and how the TEC’s new performance funding system will affect students,” says NZUSA co-President David Do.</p>
<p>NZUSA is pleased to have several important speakers at its conference, including UCOL Chief Executive Paul McElroy and chair of Universities New Zealand(and AUT Vice Chancellor) Derek McCormack. They will be speaking on Friday morning and afternoon, respectively.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have both institution heads from both sectors speak to our conference. We look forward to engaging with both speakers on a range of issues currently facing the sector and engaging with our delegates,” says NZUSA co-President Mr Pene Delaney.</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.</p>
