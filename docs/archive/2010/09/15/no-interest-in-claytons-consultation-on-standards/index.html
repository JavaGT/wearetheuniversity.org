<p>15th September 2010<br>For Immediate Release</p>
<p><strong>No Interest in Clayton’s Consultation Over National Standards</strong></p>
<p>The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa wants assurances that a new National Standards Advisory Group will address fundamental problems with the Standards, or it will not be taking part.</p>
<p>The sector group is being established by the Education Minister Anne Tolley to provide feedback and advice to support schools to continue with the implementation of the controversial National Standards. She says it is in recognition of the role the education sector has to play in the implementation of National Standards over the next three years.</p>
<p>NZEI President Frances Nelson says if the advisory group is to effect any change it must not focus on implementation of the Standards but address the key issue - that the Standards are fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p>&quot;It is absolutely imperative that discussions start with what is wrong with the Standards and whether or not they can be fixed. Unless the group provides an opportunity to do that, discussing implementation issues is a moot point when all the evidence so far shows that the Standards are unworkable.”</p>
<p>“NZEI will only go into this group if it’s going to take a meaningful look at the Standards. Unfortunately we are hearing the Minister say through the media that that is unlikely so we can only assume that our professional concerns will continue to be ignored,” she says.</p>
<p>Opposition to National Standards continues to mount. Schools are confused about how to use the Standards and parents and boards are realising they are not a proven way of raising student achievement.</p>
<p>“The sector wants to work with the government to find a “fix” but for that to happen the government must acknowledge that the Standards are flawed and be prepared to change its approach. We are not interested in Clayton’s consultation,” says Ms Nelson.</p>
