<p><strong>Tuesday, 7 September 2010, 1:37 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>UC is making good progress as it works through its earthquake recovery phase. We are focused on getting back on track.</p>
<p>Aftershocks overnight caused some additional minor damage but have not slowed up the progress of the recovery plan.</p>
<p>Structural engineers have been on campus and are expected to sign off today on the safety of 80 buildings. Checks of lifts are being carried out and access to drinkable water is being arranged.</p>
<p>Assessment teams representing all Colleges and Service Groups have been briefed and are today assessing requirements for clean up and setting priorities to enable a resumption of teaching.</p>
<p>All other staff and students are requested to remain off campus so selected personnel can focus on the recovery efforts. There will be a managed approach to clean-up efforts which will be communicated to staff and students following tomorrow’s decision concerning restarting University activities no sooner than Monday 13 September.</p>
<p>The priority for the University’s Senior Management Team is working on how we will operate business-as-usual in an unusual environment. We will be engaging with a wider group of staff in coming days and later in the week we will invite research students to NZi3 on Creyke Road for a briefing.</p>
<p>Further details will be posted on the University website (<a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz">www.canterbury.ac.nz</a>) and on our Facebook page UC Earthquake Recovery.</p>
<p>Dr Rod Carr<br>Vice-Chancellor</p>
