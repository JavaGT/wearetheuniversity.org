<p>Restoring Students’ Freedom</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand MP Heather Roy has today urged the National Party to support her Education (Freedom of Association) Bill – also known as the Voluntary Student Membership Bill – which has been tabled in Parliament today for its Second Reading.</p>
<p>“Tertiary students are currently compelled to join a student association if they want to study, and are the only people who are forced to join a union – but many of these associations do not actually represent the views of the majority of students,” Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>“My Bill gives students the right to choose whether or not to join their student association. Making membership voluntary will ensure associations are more accountable to those they claim to support.</p>
<p>“ACT was founded on the principle of freedom – including freedom of association. Stripping an entire segment of society of this right is inconsistent with the Bill of Rights and contravenes the principles of freedom of association which New Zealanders so highly prize.</p>
<p>“In many cases student organisations undertake partisan political activities against the views of the wider student body, and waste student resources. Even worse, some associations have indulged in fraudulent activity – such as the recent alleged misuse of funds at Whitireia Polytechnic.</p>
<p>“I call on the National Party – indeed, all Parties of this House – to support my Bill and the right to freedom of association for students throughout New Zealand,” Mrs Roy said.</p>
