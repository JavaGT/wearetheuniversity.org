<p><strong>Monday, 6 September 2010, 12:09 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions">New Zealand Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Unions respond to concerns in earthquake aftermath</strong></p>
<p>Helen Kelly, CTU President, said today that unions will work with government, business and the community in response to the earthquake in Canterbury.</p>
<p>“These are exceptional circumstances,” she said, “and we hope that the Government will be mindful of that as it considers what sort of support can be made available to the community including workers and employers affected.”</p>
<p>Helen Kelly said that immediate issues have been about public safety but now questions are arising about the ongoing impact on employment.</p>
<p>The CTU has been in contact during the weekend with Canterbury union officials, Peter Townsend at the Canterbury Employers Chambers of Commerce, as well as the Labour Department and Ministry of Social Development.</p>
<p>Helen Kelly said she also met this morning with Phil O’Reilly from Business NZ.</p>
<p>“At this stage I am pleased to note that a number of employers are reassuring workers about being paid if it is not practicable to work, and are taking care around issues such as health and safety, alternative work and also allowing staff to be with their families at this time.”</p>
<p>“For the next few days, practical support, as well as advice on employment, health and safety, income support, work rights and so forth will be the priority for unions.”</p>
<p>Beyond that there are many other issues including:</p>
<p>• Emergency benefits<br>• Special reconstruction employment programmes<br>• Training programmes for reconstruction<br>• Pressures on resources, transport, labour<br>• What to do if some firms may not survive<br>• Role of Housing NZ<br>• Use of tourist facilities for temporary housing<br>• Funding sources beyond insurance and Mayoral appeal etc</p>
<p>It is too early to assess all these issues and the myriad of other factors. For a major reconstruction programme, there are many issues including the response process, priorities, and time scale as well as impact on other spending.</p>
<p>Helen Kelly said that she hoped that unions would be included in the work of a Commissioner.</p>
