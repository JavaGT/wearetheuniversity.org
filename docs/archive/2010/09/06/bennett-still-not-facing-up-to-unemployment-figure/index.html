<p><strong>Monday, 6 September 2010, 2:32 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Bennett still not facing up to unemployment figures</strong><br>Minister of Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett has today released a statement, on New Zealanders ability to find work, a statement which can only be described as deliberately misleading, Labour Deputy Leader Annette King says.</p>
<p>“Paula Bennett’s attempt to put a positive spin on increasing benefit figures, claiming thousands of people were finding work is misleading,” Annette King said.</p>
<p>&quot;On closer inspection, the reality is the number of people receiving the unemployment benefit actually rose by over 850 people last month.</p>
<p>“The unemployment rate is rising, but rather than face that the Minister has taken the approach of attempting to put a positive public spin on it or is simply in denial.</p>
<p>“For quite sometime Labour has been concerned that the Minister is withholding and delaying benefit statistics. Today is another example of Ms Bennett attempting to manipulate information.</p>
<p>“However, it is clear the Minister has attempted to release a totally misleading statement.<br>“Ms Bennett should be focussed on helping the people of Canterbury rather than attempting to spin unemployment numbers,” Annette King said.</p>
