<p><strong>Poroporoaki ki a Tariana (Twiss) Wharakura</strong></p>
<p>Taupiri maunga, Waikato awa, karanga ki to korua mokopuna. Waikato taniwha rau, na koutou tenei tangata, e tangi, e tangi, e tangi. E te whanau pani, kei te tangi hoki matou o te Whare Paremata ki a Tariana kua mate ohorere nei. E hoa, e hoki ki te poho o o matua tipuna. Haere, haere, haere ki te po.</p>
<p>Maori Party co-leaders Tariana Turia and Dr Pita Sharples are deeply saddened to hear of the sudden death of Tariana ‘Twiss’ Wharakura, a long-time driver for VIP Transport.</p>
<p>“Twiss kept the wheels of government turning. He was one of the longest-serving VIP drivers in Parliament and a well-respected member of the Parliamentary team,&quot; Mrs Turia said.</p>
<p>&quot;He saw Governments, Prime Ministers and Ministers come and go. He shared in the triumphs and tragedies of the nation’s political life, through his close personal contact with Ministers of the Crown and senior political and diplomatic leaders over many years.</p>
<p>“He listened sympathetically, but complete discretion was his motto and his creed. He kept his opinions to himself – except when it came to sport,” Dr Sharples said.</p>
<p>“He was a mine of information about sport – every code, every team, every league table, score and statistic, every star. On the drive from the airport to the office, Twiss could fill you in on the weekend’s events on the courts, circuits and playing fields of the sporting world.</p>
<p>“He was a lovely man, great company to travel with in the quiet moments between official meetings and engagements, and I will really miss the korero.</p>
<p>“To his family, and his colleagues, I extend the sympathy and sorrow of the Maori Party at this sudden loss of a loved and valued brother, husband, father grandfather and colleague.”</p>
