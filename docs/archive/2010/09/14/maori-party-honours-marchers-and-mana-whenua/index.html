<p><strong>Maori Party honours marchers and mana whenua</strong></p>
<p>The Maori Party is dedicating its vote of support in the House today, for a bill that repeals a serious injustice, to the tens of thousands of people who marched in 2004 and mana whenua.</p>
<p>“We remember what our people told us on the steps of Parliament on May 5, 2004 and today we honour them with this vote,” Maori Party co-leader Tariana Turia said.</p>
<p>The co-leaders said the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Bill delivered the party’s promise to repeal the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004 which took away the right of hapu and iwi to be heard in court.</p>
<p>“We promised a repeal of that act and to restore access to justice and we have achieved that,” Mrs Turia said.</p>
<p>Dr Pita Sharples said the new legislation was a step forward.</p>
<p>“It reopens a door that was slammed shut in 2004 and creates a pathway forward,” Dr Sharples said.</p>
<p>“We accept that the bill does not settle the entire issue for tangata whenua but it has created a platform for them to pursue recognition of their mana and tikanga over the foreshore and seabed by negotiating with the Crown or going to court.”</p>
<p>“As the authentic and independent voice of Maori in Parliament, our role is to ensure Crown and Maori engage in accordance with Treaty principles of co-operation, goodwill and the utmost good faith,” the leaders said.</p>
<p>The Maori Party supports whanau, hapu and iwi efforts to uphold their mana and tikanga - whether in direct negotiations with the Crown or through the courts.</p>
