<p>NZ Food Award entries high in number, quality</p>
<p>A record number of entries have been received for this year’s New Zealand Food Awards.</p>
<p>The awards, in association with Massey University, will identify the best food products, with categories from dairy products and convenience to food business.</p>
<p>Almost 80 products and innovations were put forward for consideration by Friday’s deadline.</p>
<p>Head of the Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health Professor Richard Archer says the number and quality of entries is representative of the growing levels of innovation in the New Zealand food industry.</p>
<p>“We have entries from all corners of the food manufacturing industry, both large international exporters and backyard entrepreneurs,” Professor Archer says.</p>
<p>This year, winners will be able to display the Food Awards mark on their products, giving the buying public a clear sign of the quality of the product. “The New Zealand Food Awards stand for excellence and innovation in food production and now the Food Awards mark will make winners stand out on the shop shelves,” he says.</p>
<p>The awards will be judged in categories ranging from gourmet and convenience food to cereals and bread, and confectionary. Awards will also be given for excellence in food packaging, food safety, and research and development.</p>
<p>Entries will be judged at the Albany campus at the end of the month by a team of food industry leaders.</p>
<p>The awards will culminate with a gala dinner at Auckland’s Langham Hotel on October 28, where category finalists will be showcased and a supreme winner announced.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Food Awards are made possible by the support of principal sponsor Massey University, and supporting sponsors the Ministry of Economic Development, Riddet Institute, the Heart Foundation, AsureQuality, O-I New Zealand, and the New Zealand Institute of Food Science and Technology.</p>
