<p><strong>Sunday, 12 September 2010, 6:29 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cosgrove Appointed Earthquake Recovery Spokesman</strong></p>
<p>Labour Leader Phil Goff has appointed Clayton Cosgrove, MP for Waimakariri, the party’s spokesperson for the earthquake recovery in Canterbury.</p>
<p>“The community of Kaiapoi which has been severely affected by the recent earthquake is in Clayton’s Cosgrove’s electorate, and like all Christchurch MPs, he has been working tirelessly to help those whose lives and homes have been affected,” Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>“Clayton Cosgrove’s task will be to facilitate and co-operate with the Government efforts and the Minister Responsible for the earthquake recovery, Gerry Brownlee.</p>
<p>“The Waimakariri electorate takes in territory in both the Christchurch City Council and Waimakariri District Council areas, so Clayton is well placed to be Labour’s lead MP in the region.</p>
<p>“I have discussed the appointment of a Labour spokesperson with Gerry Brownlee ahead of this announcement and I thank him for his support.</p>
<p>“Labour is committed to a bi-partisan approach to the recovery for the people, businesses and communities of Canterbury and Christchurch.</p>
<p>“Clayton Cosgrove is a former Building and Construction Minister so is well equipped to act as Labour’s link to ensure a free flow of information and co-operation with the Government.”</p>
