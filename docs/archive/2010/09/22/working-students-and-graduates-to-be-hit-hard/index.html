<p><strong>Working students and graduates to be hit hard by proposed law</strong></p>
<p>Students and graduates will be hit hard by proposed changes to employment law. Student leaders will be appearing in front of the Transport and Industrial Relations Select Committee this afternoon to speak against the Employment Relations Amendment Bill (No.2).</p>
<p>“This Bill undermines trust and fairness in the workplace, and takes away the rights of students and graduates to a fair and decent work environment,” says NZUSA co-President David Do.</p>
<p>High fees and limited access to allowances often means students are forced to borrow to live as well as work part time on top of full time study to make ends meet. Because most students must work to support them through their studies, students will be negatively affected by this Bill.</p>
<p>NZUSA’s 2007 Income and Expenditure Survey (a three yearly comprehensive snapshot of the state of students) found that 90% of students worked at some time throughout the year. 64% of students had regular work during term time, and 58% worked over summer.</p>
<p>“Many students who finish study at the end of November try and find jobs for the summer, starting back at university or polytechnic again at the end of February. This Bill would mean that for that three month summer period they would be constantly at risk of unfair dismissal and financial hardship,” says Do.</p>
<p>The Bill would also make graduates vulnerable as they embark on new roles and careers. It would increase uncertainty for job seekers because they may have to wait three months before knowing for certain whether they will be retained in their new roles.</p>

<p>“The Bill could hurt the chances of graduates getting into long term, sustainable employment where they could utilise their skills. Some graduates may move locations to seek new jobs, and this puts major financial pressure on them and those around them. Graduates who are unfairly dismissed for no reason would be put at major financial disadvantage with no rights to appeal their dismissal,” says NZUSA co-President Pene Delaney.</p>
<p>“Hard working students and graduates do not deserve to have their rights stripped away from them at work. We call on the select committee to reject this Bill,” concludes Do.</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.</p>
