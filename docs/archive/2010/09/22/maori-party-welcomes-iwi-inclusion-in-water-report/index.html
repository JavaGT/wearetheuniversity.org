<p><strong>Maori Party welcomes iwi inclusion in water report</strong></p>
<p>The Maori Party is pleased to see the views and advice of iwi coming through in a major report on freshwater management to be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>“All too often our people have been left out of local, regional and national discussions on freshwater,” Maori Party spokesperson Te Ururoa Flavell said.</p>
<p>“And yet iwi uphold the legacy of their roles and responsibilities as tangata tiaki, to advocate for an approach to land and water use that maintains, as a matter of first principles, the goal of sustaining or restoring healthy mauri within waterways.”</p>
<p>Mr Flavell said tangata whenua were well aware of the need to leave a legacy of clean and healthy waterways for coming generations.</p>
<p>“It is essential to our tikanga because without clean water the land gets sick, we get sick and we lose the ability to fish and harvest food to feed our families.</p>
<p>“There is an explicit message emerging from this report: iwi seek formal participation in the setting of strategic development priorities at the national level.</p>
<p>“They have an absolute interest in the clean-up of degraded waterways, in participation in governance arrangements around water use and in specific plans that give effect to iwi interests and values.</p>
<p>“We have seen an impressive model emerge through agreements such as the Waikato-Tainui Settlement, which reflects the Crown-iwi Treaty relationship.</p>
<p>“We expect all future arrangements to continue to enable whanau, hapu and iwi to to play an active part in the freshwater management processes.”</p>
<p>The report <em>Land and Water Forum: A Fresh Start for Freshwater</em> looked at freshwater management. It was put together by a forum of more than 180 groups which included five iwi – Te Arawa, Ngai Tahu, Tuwharetoa, Waikato-Tainui and Whanganui.</p>
