<p><strong>Thursday, 15 July 2010, 2:17 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>**Waterview community must be compensated<br>**<br>Labour MP for Mt Albert David Shearer today urged the New Zealand Transport Agency to listen to the needs of the residents affected by the construction of the Waterview off ramp.</p>
<p>“As the local MP, I will be vigorously supporting and getting behind the local community throughout this process. It is a strong and vibrant community which has been faced with uncertainty for many years due to this project,” David Shearer said.</p>
<p>In a submission delivered to the NZTA hearing on mitigation options for the $2 Billion project, David Shearer said the community has a strong sense of what needs to be done.</p>
<p>“The off ramp at the northern end of Waterview will further isolate the community from the facilities and shopping centre of Pt Chevalier. That is why a pedestrian and cycle-bridge to Pt Chevalier is needed to ensure residents are better connected with their closest shopping area.</p>
<p>“Work has already been done on this by Auckland University and Unitec as it was part of the winning design in a recent urban design competition.”</p>
<p>David Shearer said the wellbeing of children in the area also needs to be considered.</p>
<p>“The air stack of the northern portal needs to be located in a position which has the least effect on school children at Waterview Primary School,” David Shearer said.</p>
<p>“The community has made suggestions on this and should be listened to.</p>
<p>“Metro Football Club will also lose important green space at Alan Wood Reserve and Waterview. These grounds are currently used to capacity.</p>

<p>“It has been recommended that the NZTA and local government should build an artificial football pitch to compensate for losing a well used park and meet an increased demand.</p>
<p>“The community is making a number of strong arguments to lessen the impact of an off ramp cutting their community in two. They must not end up worse off because the Government took the easy option on the Waterview link,” David Shearer said.</p>
