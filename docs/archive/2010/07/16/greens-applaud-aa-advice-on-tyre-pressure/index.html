<p><strong>Greens applaud AA advice on tyre pressure</strong></p>
<p>New Zealanders could save money and hundreds of thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions by inflating their car tyres correctly, said the Green Party today.</p>
<p>A survey by the AA has found that 48 percent of cars could have underinflated tyres, meaning nearly half the private vehicle fleet could be wasting fuel and compromising safety.</p>
<p>The survey results were published in the latest AA Directions (Winter 2010) magazine.<br>“The AA research shows a simple area where huge gains could be made, both for the economy and the environment,” said Green Party Transport spokesperson Gareth Hughes.</p>
<p>“The AA estimates that on average a car uses an extra 58 litres of fuel a year if the tyres are under-inflated.<br>“We may be wasting 73 million litres of fuel or putting 170,000 tonnes of extra carbon dioxide into the air each year because of this.</p>
<p>“The Green Party supports the excellent research undertaken by the AA, and encourages all Kiwis using a car to check their type pressure at least monthly.</p>
<p>“By keeping your tyres at the correct pressure, you could more than offset the additional costs of the Emissions Trading Scheme on fuel,” said Mr Hughes.</p>
