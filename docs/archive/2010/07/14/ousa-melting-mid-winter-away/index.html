<p><strong>OUSA: Melting Mid-Winter Away</strong></p>
<p>The ferris wheel is being constructed; bars of chocolate, bottles of cream, and kilos of hot chocolate powder are being deliciously fused together; and, in registered kitchens, groups of international students are creating delectable delicacies of food.</p>
<p>OUSA’s Carnival, Market and International Food Festival are almost here.</p>
<p>“We are expecting thousands of students and members of the public to visit the OUSA lawn tomorrow to enjoy everything we have put on” says Vanessa Reddy, OUSA Events Manager.</p>
<p>The daytime Carnival Market contains all the fun of the carnival with a ferris wheel, chairoplane rides, blow up bouncy-castle, shooting gallery, and a host of market day stalls. OUSA is giving away free mugs, filled with fairtrade hot chocolate – as both a warming ‘gift’ for visitors, and its contribution to the Chocolate Festival. There is also live entertainment throughout the day and into the night.</p>
<p>The International Food Festival – the largest student food festival in the country – is alone expected to attract thousands of visitors.</p>
<p>OUSA is selling food festival ‘food tokens’ through its main office throughout the day so people visiting the night-time food festival can spend their evening eating rather than queuing. Unused tokens can be redeemed for cash after the event.</p>
<p>“This is OUSA’s favourite time of the year. Winter in Dunedin is always a celebratory time and our members love the Carnival and Food Festival.” said Harriet Geoghegan, OUSA President.</p>
