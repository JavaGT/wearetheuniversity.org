<p><strong>Thursday, 22 July 2010, 11:11 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato">University of Waikato</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Waikato student scoops one of three petroleum scholarships</strong>  </p>
<p>Waikato University’s Victoria McCullough has become the first University of Waikato engineering student to receive a scholarship from the Society of Petroleum Engineers.</p>
<p>Each year, three scholarships are made available to third year (or above) students at Auckland, Massey and Lincoln University. This year the society opened this up to Waikato University students.</p>
<p>Victoria, 20, put her application in on the basis of a ‘give it a go’ attitude, and was overwhelmed when she heard the news. “It’s very cool – I didn’t except it at all. There isn’t a lot of engineering opportunities out there so it’s great to get this.”</p>
<p>She says the $3000 scholarship, which specifically focuses on the area of petroleum engineering, has a prestigious reputation in New Zealand. Victoria will use the scholarship money her course fees at Waikato University, including textbooks.</p>
<p>Victoria is in her third year studying towards a Bachelor of Engineering, majoring in Materials and Processing.</p>
<p>She says it’s a male-dominated profession, and she has had to have an outgoing attitude. She is looking forward to the opportunity of some work experience, which is one of the benefits of receiving the scholarship. “The oil and gas industry is pretty hard to crack into. Once you’re in, there are heaps of opportunities and hopefully this will include some travel.”</p>
<p>The Society of Petroleum Engineers is a professional association with more than 92,000 members worldwide who dedicate themselves to improving technologies for production in the oil and gas industry.</p>
