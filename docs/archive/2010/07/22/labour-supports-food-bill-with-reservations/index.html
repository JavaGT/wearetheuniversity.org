<p><strong>Thursday, 22 July 2010, 4:19 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Labour supports Food Bill with reservations</strong></p>
<p>The Government’s intention to allow employers to demand a medical certificate from employees if they have a day off sick makes the Food Bill initiated by Labour even more important, says Labour Food Safety spokesperson Ashraf Choudhary.</p>
<p>“New Zealand has 18,000 cases of intestinal illness a year, 1000 of who require hospitalisation,” Ashraf Choudhary said. “The total cost of all this illness – mostly in terms of absence from the work place --- is estimated to be $86 million a year.”</p>
<p>The Government introduced the Food Bill in Parliament today because existing legislation had “grown like topsy and was difficult to enforce.</p>
<p>“The level of food-borne illness in New Zealand is not acceptable for our developed nation. The rates are higher than the United States, Great Britain and Australia.”</p>
<p>Dr Choudhary said it was vital that all food businesses had certainty about their obligations to New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“This Bill will largely provide that, removing areas of confusion for food handlers because obligations will be spelled out in a food plan.”</p>
<p>Dr Choudhary said Labour had some misgivings and reservations about National’s version of the Bill, however.</p>
<p>“We are not convinced that National is going to keep compliance costs to a minimum. The last thing we want is for the Bill to create an environment that is overly bureaucratic and expensive for food businesses and consumers,” Ashraf Choudhary said.</p>
<p>“According to documents released to Labour under the Official Information Act, fees in Dunedin for some classes of premises have increased by over $300. This is a substantial amount.</p>

<p>“Labour is also concerned that with a greater emphasis on self-monitoring there is a danger of operators becoming both the poacher and the gamekeeper. While it is important to have light-handed regulation, it must be regulation that works to reduce our appalling record of food-borne illness,” Ashraf Choudhary said.</p>
<p>”Labour is confident that this Bill will have no impact on Kiwi cake stalls and sausage sizzles.</p>
<p>“On the whole, it is a good Bill. Labour is proud of the work it has done in making it a reality.”</p>
