<p><strong>Student Leaders Set To Encourage Forward Thinking</strong></p>
<p>Student leaders from universities and polytechnics around the country will converge in Dunedin this week for the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) July Conference. The Otago University Students’ Association will host the conference over four days between July 7 and 10.</p>
<p>“Student delegates from all around New Zealand will be discussing many issues pertinent to the current tertiary environment. These include how the Government’s announcements in Budget 2010 and general policy direction affect quality, access, and equity in tertiary education,” says NZUSA co-President David Do.</p>
<p>NZUSA is pleased to have several important speakers at its conference, including Minister of Tertiary Education Steven Joyce and Tertiary Education Union national secretary Sharn Riggs.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have the Minister speak to his first NZUSA conference. We look forward to hearing the Minister consider a range of issues currently facing the sector and engaging with our delegates,” says NZUSA co-President Mr Pene Delaney.</p>
<p>The conference will also have a variety of workshops covering a wide spectrum of areas, including:<br>• Challenges and threats to public education<br>• Access, entry, and equity<br>• Welfare and student support services<br>• Student associations working with the community</p>
