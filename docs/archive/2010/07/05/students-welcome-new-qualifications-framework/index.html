<p><strong>Students Welcome New Qualifications Framework</strong></p>
<p>Current and potential students will welcome today’s establishment of a single unified qualifications framework. Student leaders are pleased that students can look forward to using a clearer system to understand what they can study and where that can lead them to.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Qualifications Framework (NZQF) has replaced the Register of Quality Assured Qualifications and the National Qualifications Framework (NQF). It is one of multiple changes that will flow from the current NZQA Targeted Review of Qualifications</p>
<p>“We support the intent of the Review and this new framework because this will make life easier for current and future students, especially at polytechnics,” says NZUSA co-President David Do.</p>
<p>“Previously, many students may have found it difficult to find the right course for their needs and aspirations, and to ensure that the skills and knowledge they learned were transferable to other employers, or even other regions!”</p>
<p>Positive results for students from the Review would include less confusion and duplication of qualifications, and improved recognition and transferability of qualifications. Over time, these changes will make it easier for a student to create a coherent pathway if they wish to staircase and pursue further study.</p>
<p>“We support having a much stronger, clearer system which everyone will find easier to understand. These moves help support quality and enhance student decision-making,” says NZUSA co-President Pene Delaney.</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.</p>
