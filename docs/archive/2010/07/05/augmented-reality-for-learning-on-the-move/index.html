<p><strong>&#39;Augmented reality&#39; for learning on the move</strong></p>
<p>Mobile technology applications that enable people to interact with their surroundings are set to become a new way of learning, says Information Technology specialist Dr David Parsons.</p>
<p>Dr Parsons is one of two keynote speakers at a conference called Computer-Human Interaction to be held at the Albany campus next Thursday. He will discuss what he calls &quot;augmented learning&quot; – the latest trends in the use of mobile technology to enhance users&#39; experiences by overlaying digital data on actual occurrences.</p>
<p>A senior lecturer at the University&#39;s Institute of Information and Mathematical Sciences, Dr Parsons says mobile devices such as smart phones can have applications relevant to the user&#39;s location, such as such tracking technology. Augmented reality research projects currently under way include an application that plays birdsong recordings matched to a particular habitat, and another for a reality business game linked to players&#39; positions in a given location.</p>
<p>Applications can be adapted locally to tourism and archaeology, he says. He is considering a project to develop mobile phone software that could provide visitors to Auckland volcano Mt Eden with information on ancient Mäori sites such as food storage pits, images and sounds related to Mäori settlement, quiz questions and a treasure hunt.</p>
<p>&quot;Humans now have an embarrassment of riches at their fingertips in terms of multiple and complex connectivity.&quot;</p>
<p>Conference organiser and senior lecturer in information technology Dr Hokyoung Ryu says the forum will discuss significant mobile developments in the workplace, such as computer table tops connecting several people in different locations.</p>
<p>Mobile technology for social networking and health support for the elderly, people with traumatic brain injury or disorders such as anxiety or autism are also growth areas featured at the conference.</p>
<p>Keynote speaker Daniel MacLaren, from Auckland software firm Orion Health, will discuss how life-threatening medical crises can be averted through the latest health care-related mobile applications.</p>
<p>The conference will be held on July 8 in the Quad A Building. For more details:<br><a href="http://chinz2010.massey.ac.nz/">http://chinz2010.massey.ac.nz/</a></p>
