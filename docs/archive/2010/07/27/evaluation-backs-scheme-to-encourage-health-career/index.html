<p><strong>Tuesday, July 27, 2010</strong><br><strong>Evaluation backs scheme to encourage health careers</strong></p>
<p>A pilot scheme to give Hawke&#39;s Bay secondary school pupils insights into health sector jobs has been praised by Massey University researchers for addressing shortages in the health workforce.</p>
<p>In a just-published evaluation, the team of researchers recommends schools and district health boards adopt the &quot;Incubator&quot; scheme nationally so that more school leavers will be inspired to work in health.</p>
<p>They also highlighted the need for better access to tertiary education funding for health training, and to recruit more Maori and Pasifika to ensure indigenous and ethnic representation in health services.</p>
<p>Other findings were that the scheme was successful in reinforcing an existing interest in health careers for some pupils, and firming up goals among those with a moderate interest.</p>
<p>&quot;What is disappointing is to hear that a number are discouraged by funding their tertiary education and training. Incubator helps develop the interest but practical considerations – funding the required study or moving away from home/friends – presents a barrier,&quot; the report says.</p>
<p>Professor Paul Spoonley, Research Director for the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, led the evaluation team, which included Dr Denise Wilson and Dr Stephen Neville from the School of Health and Social Services in Albany, Jeffery Adams from Massey&#39;s Centre for Social and Health Outcomes Research and Evaluation in Auckland, and Massey research assistant Peter Russell.</p>

<p>The Incubator scheme was launched in 2007, when the Hawke&#39;s Bay District Health Board organised visits to a local school by health professionals, including doctors, nurses, midwives, social workers, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, laboratory scientists and technicians. They told pupils about their jobs, how they got into their careers and some of the issues they dealt with.</p>
<p>The scheme is now operating in 15 schools in various district health boards nationwide. Its aim is to address serious recruitment and retention issues in the health workforce, with increased shortages and pressures expected in coming years due to the ageing population, says Professor Spoonley, a sociologist.</p>
<p>Feedback from 73 pupils in five Hawke&#39;s Bay schools and one Auckland school who took part in the scheme included comments that indicated they not only enjoyed the experience but also gained understanding of what different jobs involved.</p>
