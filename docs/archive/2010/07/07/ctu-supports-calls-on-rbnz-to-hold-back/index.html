<p><strong>CTU supports calls on RBNZ to hold back on interest rate hikes</strong>  </p>
<p>The CTU, which opposed the Reserve Bank’s June increase in interest rates, has joined calls for the Bank to hold off any further increases.</p>
<p>“We still have high unemployment levels in New Zealand and people are very cautious in their spending,” said CTU Economist and Policy Director Bill Rosenberg. “There is a low risk of inflation taking off despite the spike likely early next year due to GST, the effect of emissions trading, and other government policy changes.”</p>
<p>“At any rate, the risk of New Zealand returning to recession in the light of international conditions means that inflation should be a secondary consideration.”</p>
<p>“Governments in Europe are on a self-destructive round of big cuts in government spending that increase the risk of a second dip into recession. The US economy is not showing signs of a sustained recovery. Some international commentators such as Nobel Memorial Prize economist Paul Krugman are warning of the risk of full blown depression as a result.”</p>
<p>New Zealand’s increasing exports are largely driven by high prices for a relatively small number of commodities and demand from East Asia which could slow if their exports to Europe and North America are throttled by austerity measures there. Manufacturing has had a few good months of exports but this was helped by a more favourable exchange rate with Australia which has now reversed.</p>
<p>“The New Zealand government seems to have no Plan B if world recovery falters,” said Rosenberg. “It should be getting ready a stimulus package such as infrastructure projects, new housing, increasing opportunities for tertiary education and skill development, and further support for employment and people who lose their jobs if there is a turn for the worse.”</p>
<p>“It is important that the Reserve Bank is particularly cautious under these conditions.”</p>
