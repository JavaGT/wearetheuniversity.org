<p><strong>Communities muck in to make Cycleway happen</strong></p>
<p>Funding announced for eight more Cycleway projects will see another eight communities pull together to deliver on their promise of partnership, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>The Government has confirmed $18.85 million for the construction of eight further Cycleway trails throughout New Zealand. They include: the Old Motu Coach Road (Opotiki), the Lake Track (Taupo), the Dun Mountain Trail and Tasman Loop (Nelson), the Heretaunga Ararau (Napier), the Westland Wilderness Trail, the Alps to Ocean Trail (Otago), and the Queenstown &amp; Clutha Gold Trail.</p>
<p>“Successfully completing a Cycleway trail involves a whole-of-community effort. Here we have another eight committed communities stepping up to meet that challenge,” said Green Party cycling spokesperson, Kevin Hague.</p>
<p>“At the recent launch of the Nga Ara Tuhono Cycleway in Ohakune, I was impressed by the fact that this project is being delivered by a combination of local council, iwi, community groups, businesses, and kids from Ruapehu College and Ohakune Primary School.</p>
<p>“The talk in the town is that there may now be enough people in town over summer to keep businesses open year-round, changing many jobs from seasonal ones held by out-of-towners to permanent stable ones for locals.</p>
<p>“The Cycleway is a smart way to build up the resilience of local rural economies,” said Mr Hague.</p>
<p>The Green Party is working jointly with the Government to realise a shared vision for a national cycle network. The Government recognises the Green Party’s particular expertise in active modes of transport, especially cycling.</p>

<p>“The long-term vision for this project is for a network of cycling routes and tracks throughout the country that can be used by tourists and recreational riders, but eventually by people also riding to work or the supermarket, and kids riding to school,” said Mr Hague.</p>
<p>“These additional eight trails will take us a few steps closer to the goal of an integrated network of cycle trails.”</p>
<p>The Cycle Trail project has a highly successful precedent overseas. The UK National Cycle Network (<a href="http://www.sustrans.org.uk/">SUSTRANS</a>) was started with seed funding of £43 million in 1995. The Network now consists of over 10,000 miles of signed cycle routes carrying 386 million journeys in 2008. That usage realised £270 million in health savings and offered potential carbon emissions savings of 493,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>“The UK experience demonstrates the massive economic benefits of central government investment in cycling infrastructure. For every £1 spent on the UK’s cycle network, they’re realising up to £18-£40 in benefits,” added Mr Hague.  </p>
