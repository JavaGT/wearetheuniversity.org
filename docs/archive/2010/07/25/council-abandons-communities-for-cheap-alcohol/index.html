<p><strong>Council Abandons Communities For Cheap Alcohol</strong></p>
<p>The Hutt City Council has effectively left local communities to fight on their own to stop liquor stores opening up in their neighbourhoods, said Harbour Ward candidate Robert Ashe today.</p>
<p>“The Hutt City Council has turned its back on the residents of Waiwhetu and Wainuiomata leaving them alone in their fight to stop yet another liquor store opening up in their communities,” said Mr Ashe.</p>
<p>“Without effective measures to reduce the harm caused by alcohol, our most vulnerable communities will continue to bear the heavy social costs of having alcohol cheapily and readily available for sale at all hours of the day and night.”</p>
<p>Robert Ashe joined concerned residents and a representative from the local marae to pack a Wellington Tribunal hearing and voice their concerns about the granting of an off licence for the Waiwhetu Discount Liquor shop seeking to establish on 1 Waiwhetu Road. The Tribunal is still to make their decision.</p>
<p>“The Council has the power to stop the increasing numbers of liquor stores opening up in our communities. They simply lack the courage to address the harm that’s going on there.”</p>
<p>“Our Sale of Liquor Policy has the stated goal of reducing alcohol-related harm, yet offers few effective mechanisms for achieving this. The District Plan could also explicitly limit the hours of operation of liquor stores but fails even in this small measure,” said Mr Ashe.</p>
<p>Waikato University research shows a strong relationship between off-licence density and higher levels of anti-social behaviour, drug and alcohol offences, family violence, property abuse, property damage, traffic offences and motor vehicle accidents.</p>

<p>The Law Commission had also recommended cutting back the hours licensed premises are open, introducing new grounds upon which licences to sell alcohol can be declined, allowing more local input into licensing decisions through local alcohol policies and District Licensing Agencies.</p>
<p>“I’m heartened by the community response that has rallied in Waiwhetu in quick time. These are people who love their homes and marae and want their children to live in safe, happy communities. It’s time Council supported them.”</p>
