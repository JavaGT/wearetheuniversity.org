<p>More than 300 geographers from around the world will be gathering at Rydges Hotel in Christchurch next week to participate in the biennial conference of the New Zealand Geographical Society in association with the Institute of Australian Geographers.</p>
<p>The programme includes three leading international scholars conducting cutting-edge scholarship on the theme of geospatial technologies.</p>
<p>On Monday night, Professor Lisa Parks ( University of California-Santa Barbara) will open the conference with a keynote exploring the controversies which surround the emergence of Google Earth and its use in the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, Dr Matt Duckham (University of Melbourne) will discuss some of the scientific challenges facing computing systems which must compute simultaneously in and about geographic space.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning, Professor John Wilson (University of Southern California) will discuss the transformations taking place in geographic information science and their implications for the discipline of geography.</p>
<p>In addition to the keynotes, conference delegates will present a large number of papers over three days on a number of geographic themes. Conference panels will explore among other things indigenous knowledges and rights, contemporary media and new technologies, third world development and tourism, sustainability and climate change, health and healthcare, urban change and transformation, relationships between humans and animals and gender and sexuality.</p>
