<p><strong>Crunch Time for Government on National Standards</strong></p>
<p>The Government can no longer ignore the snowballing opposition to its National Standards policy, says the education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa.</p>
<p>550 principals at the New Zealand Principals Federation Conference have passed three resolutions spelling out their complete lack of confidence in the Standards and their implementation.</p>
<p>The principals, who represent Principals Associations around the country, say National Standards don’t work and will not deliver on the government’s promise to raise student achievement.</p>
<p>The President of NZEI, Frances Nelson says the government has completely lost touch with where the sector is at with National Standards.</p>
<p>“The Education Minister continues to say that only a handful of schools are not implementing the Standards or are resistant. What she’s failing to acknowledge is that whether schools feel compelled to implement or not, principals and teachers have no confidence in the Standards and the rushed implementation process.”</p>
<p>“The government wants us as professionals to get on with implementing the Standards, but we’re saying that as professionals we have serious concerns which should be taken on board.”</p>
<p>Principals are describing the Standards as “irreconcilably flawed and unworkable”. Parents are increasingly confused with the government telling them that schools are still working through the Standards and not to be alarmed if their children’s reports are not 100% right.</p>
<p>Frances Nelson says it is crunch time and finding a way forward is a priority.</p>
<p>“To do that the Education Minister needs to take off her blinkers and open the door which she has kept firmly shut during this whole process. We need to have the confidence that she is prepared to listen to our concerns and recognise our willingness to work together to find a solution.”</p>
