<p><strong>Friday, 2 July 2010, 11:55 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>**Grim warnings on National’s next targets<br>**<br>Finance Minister Bill English is giving coded warnings that its upcoming targets include interest-free student loans, Working for Families and free school education, says Labour Finance spokesperson David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“National has already inflicted savage cuts on entitlements to early childhood education, but Bill English is not going to stop there,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“Speaking in Auckland this week, Mr English said that one powerful influence driving personal debt over savings was government welfare.</p>
<p>“And he added: ‘The government gives free childcare, free compulsory education, no interest on tertiary ... and pay per week per child. Everything is free so why should people save?’&quot;</p>
<p>David Cunliffe said this was clearly another indication that the Government has interest-free student loans firmly in its sights, while the Working for Families package is also at risk.</p>
<p>“But more than that, his comments could be interpreted to mean that Kiwis don’t save because of free education.</p>
<p>“Does Bill English really believe that if National charges Kiwis more for so-called free education, that they will reassess the way they spend and the way they save.</p>
<p>“That is absolute and arrogant nonsense,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“Hard-working Kiwis are already struggling to make ends meet. If they have to pay for more aspects of free education for their kids, they&#39;ll have even less money to save.”</p>
