<p><strong>Wednesday, 21 July 2010, 4:08 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>**More uncertainty for arts organisations<br>**</p>
<p>The Government response to arts organisations that have been waiting for funding to keep afloat in this economic climate is an announcement that they will now have to re-apply to Creative New Zealand for one of two new funds, Labour spokesperson for Arts, Culture and Heritage Steve Chadwick said today.</p>
<p>“The review of the Recurrent Funding Programme has simply ended up as a rebranding to an Arts Leadership Investment programme and an Arts Development Investment programme.</p>
<p>“Organisations I have met as I travelled around the country have all wanted certainty. But so far we have seen arts organisations in Otago stripped of their funding and given no certainty for the future.</p>
<p>“Yesterday’s announcement was nicely worded but whether it will have a positive impact on creative endeavours in New Zealand remains to be seen.</p>
<p>“Organisations now have to wait and see if they are lucky enough to be chosen for funding under the new regime, creating increased uncertainty in the sector”, Ms Chadwick said.</p>
<p>“The Minister needs to stop dragging the chain on funding certainty and realise that the Creative sector engages positively communities.</p>
<p>“This should be a time when the sector can thrive given the right support from a caring government. This is like ‘Waiting for Godot’,” said spokesperson Steve Chadwick.</p>
