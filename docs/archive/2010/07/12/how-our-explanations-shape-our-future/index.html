<p><strong>Monday, 12 July 2010, 5:01 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>How our explanations shape our future</strong></p>
<p>A Victoria University Professor says a simple change in the way we explain things could significantly alter the course of events in our lives, from exam results—to whether or not we survive a disastrous earthquake.</p>
<p>Professor John McClure’s research into decision making and causal attribution has extended psychological theories, contributing to changes in the way NCEA is structured, and assisting our understanding of what increases people’s motivation to prepare for a major earthquake.</p>
<p>“The way we explain events in our lives has a significant effect on our feelings and our motivations,” says Professor McClure.</p>
<p>“This fundamental principle of psychology means that the way we explain something—our explanation of people being harmed in earthquakes and students’ explanations of their results in NCEA, as examples—can profoundly shape our destiny.”</p>
<p>Professor McClure will use such examples to illustrate the breadth of his ground-breaking research in his inaugural professorial lecture at Victoria University on Tuesday 20 July.</p>
<p>Professor McClure, from Victoria’s School of Psychology, has worked with other researchers in New Zealand and internationally, in addition to the Ministry of Education, GNS Science, the Earthquake Commission and the New South Wales State Emergency Service on practical applications for his research.</p>
<p>In 2007, a research collaboration with Victoria’s Faculty of Education led by Professor Luanna Meyer resulted in changes to NCEA, including the move to offer endorsements of the qualification with ‘merit’ and ‘excellence’.</p>

<p>He has also advised the Earthquake Commission on the way they communicate their message to New Zealanders. His research shows which messages about hazards decrease people’s fatalism and increase their preparedness.</p>
<p>“A lot of people in New Zealand, and particularly Wellington, think that if the ‘big one’ hits there is nothing we can do about it—when in reality there is a lot you can do about it. So in that sense your explanations for people’s outcomes do shape your destiny. In this case they could decide whether you live or die.”</p>
<p>Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Pat Walsh says Professor McClure has established an outstanding reputation for highly relevant applied research in psychology.</p>
<p>“His work has been extended to areas such as the development of an Earthquake Readiness Scale, the misattribution of the actions of people with brain injuries and a study of the impact of NCEA on student motivation.</p>
<p>“Professor McClure’s interdisciplinary approach to psychology research has seen his work published in the highest-quality international journals, but just as importantly it is making real-world improvements to many areas outside of his academic field.”</p>
<p>Professor Walsh says Victoria’s Inaugural Lecture series is an opportunity for new professors to provide family, friends, colleagues and the wider community with an insight into their specialist area of study.</p>
<p>“It is also an opportunity for the university to celebrate and acknowledge our valued professors.”</p>
<p><strong>The public lecture is at 6pm in the Hunter Council Chamber, Level 2, Hunter Building, Kelburn Parade, at Victoria University’s Kelburn Campus on Tuesday 20 July. To RSVP, email <a href="mailto:rsvp@vuw.ac.nz">rsvp@vuw.ac.nz</a> with ‘McClure’ in the subject line.</strong></p>
