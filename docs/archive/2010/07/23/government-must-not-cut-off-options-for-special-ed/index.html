<p>**Government must not cut off options for Special Education<br>**</p>
<p>The release of the Education Review Office investigation into special education highlights the folly of the National-Act government&#39;s decree that there will be no new money for special education, Grant Robertson Labour Special Education Spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&quot;Additional funding is not the only thing required to create a more inclusive education system, but it is definitely part of the solution,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>“This report shows that it was farcical for Heather Roy to explicitly rule out additional funding when she announced the government&#39;s review of special education. There needs to be resources to support the change in the system that everyone recognises is needed.</p>
<p>&quot;I certainly support the importance of better training for all teachers in the area of special education, and for more support for leadership and professional development.</p>
<p>“But on their own these will require additional resourcing, let alone the costs that schools and families face in supporting students to simply be at school.</p>
<p>&quot;The findings of the ERO report match with the experience for many parents and students that I have worked with. While many schools provide a supportive environment for students with high needs, some parents and students struggle to navigate their way through the system, and do not always get appropriate support.</p>
<p>“This places additional pressure on families who are already have enough to deal with.</p>
<p>&quot;We are all now anxiously awaiting the outcome of the Minister&#39;s review. There is certainly a need to improve coordination and efficiency, but I hope that the Minister will not use the review as an opportunity to push the ACT party&#39;s ideological approach to education, but rather will support positive change, including seeking additional resources where that is needed,&quot; Grant Robertson said.</p>
