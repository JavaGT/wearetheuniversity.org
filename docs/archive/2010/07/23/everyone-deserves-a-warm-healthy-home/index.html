<p><strong>Everyone deserves a warm healthy home</strong></p>
<p>Green Party MP Gareth Hughes is touring universities to promote his new member’s bill that will help ensure that everyone has a warm home. He will also be talking to students about the substandard housing they have to live in.</p>
<p>“Everybody deserves warm healthy homes; it’s only fair. My Warm Healthy Rental bill will ensure that all New Zealand&#39;s rental homes meet basic standards for warmth and insulation by 2018, said Mr Hughes, Green Party Housing spokesperson.</p>
<p>Gareth’s tour begins on Monday in Auckland and will finish in Wellington on the 20th of August. See below for further details. Gareth&#39;s bill will be entered into the next members&#39; bill ballot.</p>
<p>The majority of the 1.6 million occupied houses in New Zealand do not have sufficient levels of insulation or efficient clean heating devices and a significant proportion do not meet World Health Organisation guide lines for adequate internal temperature.</p>
<p>“Adequate housing is a essential that all New Zealanders should be guaranteed. We know that there are a lot of cold damp rentals out there and that lots of people have to live in them because they don’t have the money to move.</p>
<p>“Cold, damp housing has a big impact on people&#39;s health which has flow-on effects for how they get on in education and employment.</p>
<p>“Sick days from cold houses lead to lost productivity and strain on the health system, which will be made worse by the fact that you now need a medical certificate to take a day off.</p>

<p>“This policy will not only protect people’s health, it will protect the planet by lowering emissions from energy production.</p>
<p>“Landlords will benefit by having the value of their properties increased when they insulate them, and it will encourage them to take advantage of the $323 million home insulation scheme that the Greens set up.</p>
<p>“I will be touring around the country to see our coldest flats and homes to get a first hand view of how people are living, and to talk about solutions for what is a big problem that affects a whole range of New Zealanders, especially the young and poor.</p>
<p>“I hope the Government will give all New Zealanders a fair go and support our bill to provide warm healthy homes,” said Mr Hughes.</p>
