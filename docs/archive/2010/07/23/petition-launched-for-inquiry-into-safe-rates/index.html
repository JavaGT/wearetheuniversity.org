<p><strong>Petition launched for inquiry into safe rates in trucking industry</strong></p>
<p>Labour’s Transport Safety spokesperson Darien Fenton has launched a petition calling for an inquiry into whether there is a link between truck driver remuneration and safety in the road transport industry.</p>
<p>This comes after the government refused a Select Committee Inquiry earlier this year, despite revelations that truck drivers are routinely breaking logbook rules, scrimping on maintenance and working ridiculously long hours just to make ends meet.  </p>
<p>“Economic factors are having a direct impact on the death and injury toll caused by truck related accidents in New Zealand, but the government is in denial about this,” says Ms Fenton.  </p>
<p>“The current situation, particularly for small business owner drivers, can result in drivers working excessive hours to meet schedules, overloading their trucks and cutting back on vehicle maintenance.</p>
<p>“Far too often, the only control over the situation a truck driver has is to make up time and their rate of pay through unsafe practices.</p>
<p>“With an average of one death and 20 injuries a week in truck related crashes, and a cost to communities and families of more than $400 million annually, I would have thought the government would show a bit more interest.</p>
<p>A study by a team of academics in the US led by Professor Michael Belzer found the probability of a truck crash fell by 36 percent for every 10 percent increase in wages.</p>

<p>“An inquiry could take a hard look at current driving hours regulations, the current contracting cost models, the pressures on small business owner drivers and the responsibility of those further up the supply chain.</p>
<p>“If the government thinks there are no problems, it won’t have any problems agreeing to the call for an inquiry when this petition is returned to Parliament” says Ms Fenton.</p>
