<p><strong>Friday, 12 February 2010, 9:37 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>**Minister shows no interest in Pacific unemployment<br>**</p>
<p>Minister for Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett shows no empathy for the more than 12,000 Pacific people currently unemployed in New Zealand, says Labour Associate Social Development spokesperson Carmel Sepuloni.</p>
<p>“Paula Bennett was asked a question in the House today regarding measures to assist the Pacific population of New Zealand, whose unemployment rate has this month reached 14.3 per cent.</p>
<p>“The Minister’s answer proves that the National Government has failed New Zealand’s Pacific population. In the face of soaring unemployment in Pacific communities, the Government has not implemented any measures specifically targeted at Pacific people without work.</p>
<p>“Paula Bennett seems to have no empathy towards Pacific individuals and families who are struggling to make ends meet in the current economic climate. Pacific unemployment is growing rapidly, yet the Minister does nothing.</p>
<p>“The Minister is taking the exact same trickle-down approach that the National Government used in the 1990s, when Pacific unemployment reached as high as 28 per cent.</p>
<p>“The Pacific population is a youthful population, meaning they are missing out twice under National. While the recession has harmed their chances of employment, cuts to tertiary education funding and a refusal to lift the caps on tertiary institution numbers has meant that at the same time opportunities for further training and up-skilling have decreased.</p>
<p>“Pacific people have a message for the Minister: she needs to listen to Pacific communities, and she needs to take action to curb unemployment.”</p>
