<p>2 February 2010<br>Media Statement<br>National Standards introduced today</p>
<p>Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, MP for Maungakiekie, welcomed the introduction of National Standards this week, as primary and intermediate schools return after the summer break.</p>
<p>“This is a very exciting year for education. Our National Standards policy is a groundbreaking initiative, and a critical part of the Government’s plan to lift education standards across the country,” Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
<p>“National Standards will help the one in five students currently leaving school without the basic skills they need.”</p>
<p>From this year, primary and intermediate schools will report to parents twice a year in plain language on their child’s progress in reading, writing and maths.</p>
<p>“I’m delighted that for the first time, parents in Maungakiekie will get the information they want and deserve about their children’s progress.</p>
<p>“Children who are slipping behind will be identified, so teachers and parents can help them improve before it’s too late,” he says.</p>
<p>The Government is spending $36 million over four years to support schools which have identified students who need more support. There will also be $26 million to provide training and support for teachers, principals and boards of trustees to help with the implementation of National Standards.</p>
<p>“National Standards will be independently monitored and evaluated over the next three years to make sure we get it right,” Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
<p>“The National-led Government will continue to work hard this year alongside schools, parents and communities to make sure our children get the quality education they deserve.”</p>
