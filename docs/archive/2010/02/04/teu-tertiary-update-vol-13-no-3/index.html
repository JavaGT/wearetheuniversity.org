<p>PM DIAGNOSES TERTIARY EDUCATION WITH ECONOMIC WOES</p>
<p>The prime minister John Key told TV3&#39;s Sunrise this week that he has<br>given Steven Joyce the tertiary education portfolio to sort out the sector&#39;s<br>economic issues.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the tertiary sector a lot of the challenges that lie before<br>that sector are quite economic in nature&quot;, stated the prime minister.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some polytechnics which are struggling financially. There are<br>issues around basically how the student loan policy works. There could be<br>improvements in that policy, for instance. There&#39;re a lot of economic issues<br>in there and from our perspective Steven Joyce is well placed to take on<br>those issues.&quot;</p>
<p>When later challenged by NZUSA co-president David Do on what &#39;improvements&#39;<br>to the student loan scheme might mean, the Prime Minister confirmed that the<br>government is not going to change interest-free student loans, telling the<br>New Zealand Herald:</p>
<p>&quot;At the margins, at the boundaries, there are specific issues where, as I<br>understand it, the universities and the student associations have been<br>having some discussions,&quot; Mr Key said. &quot;But zero percent loans remain.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Joyce has not made any public statement yet on his views regarding the<br>economic situation of New Zealand&#39;s tertiary education system generally, or<br>how best to address the problem of financially struggling polytechnics.</p>
<p>ALSO IN TERTIARY UPDATE THIS WEEK:</p>

<p>UNIVERSITY OF OTAGO TO MERGE SCHOOLS TO SAVE MONEY</p>
<p>A University of Otago is proposing to merge the departments of Design<br>Studies and Clothing and Textile Sciences.</p>
<p>The university told staff in the departments last week of a proposal to<br>establish a department of Applied Sciences, which would incorporate Clothing<br>and Textile Sciences and elements of the department of Design Studies.</p>
<p>&quot;The process of considering the proposal is at an early stage, and people<br>who work in these departments are currently being consulted,&quot; pro<br>vice-chancellor, sciences, Professor Vernon Squire told the Otago Daily<br>Times.</p>
<p>Prof Squire told the Otago Daily Times the university was facing a<br>difficult financial environment and the proposal was partly the result of<br>this situation.</p>
<p>&quot;It is too early to determine how this might affect jobs and a specific<br>time-frame is not established.&quot;</p>
<p>TEU national president Dr Tom Ryan says that announcements like these are<br>challenging for staff who are concerned not only about their employment, but<br>with the interests of their students, as well as maintaining their<br>subject’s presence in the university.</p>
<p>&quot;TEU staff and members are considering the proposals, and will provide the<br>university with a response to them. However it is too early to guess at<br>outcomes, as this is just the beginning of the consultation phase.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is part of ongoing restructuring in the tertiary education sector and<br>highlights financial pressure in the sector. I hope the new minister of<br>tertiary education recognises the need to invest in tertiary education in a<br>way that protects jobs and professional skills, while also enhancing<br>educational outcomes for students,&quot; said Dr Ryan.</p>
<p>TAX REFORMS UNLIKELY TO ADDRESS FUNDING OR INEQUALITY</p>
<p>Prime minister John Key is preparing to announce at the opening of<br>parliament next week his government&#39;s view on reforms to the tax system.<br>At this stage he has ruled out increasing the government&#39;s revenue base so<br>that it can better afford to fund tertiary education and other sectors that<br>must drive any economic recovery.</p>
<p>However, CTU economist Bill Rosenberg has warned that the Tax Working Group,<br>which the prime minister established and recently has reported back to him,<br>may not have considered the issues broadly enough.</p>
<p>&quot;It limited its view of the taxation system largely to its revenue gathering<br>purpose. Yet there are other purposes for the taxation system, notably to<br>redistribute income in an unequal society. Given the substantial rise in<br>inequality and poverty in New Zealand, particularly over the 1980’s and<br>90’s, this review was an ideal opportunity to look for ways to use the<br>taxation system for this important social purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Rosenberg says that officials did a good job of testing different<br>proposals for their effect on income inequality and poverty, but the results<br>were used to maintain the inequality status quo rather than improve things.</p>
<p>TEU national president Dr Tom Ryan says it is unfortunate that the<br>government still fails to see that investment in higher education is an<br>important way of beating recession, creating employment opportunities for<br>young people, and improving the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;United States president Obama recently said &#39;the best anti-poverty<br>programme around is a world-class education’. Like the United States,<br>France, Germany, Australia and so many other countries, New Zealand could<br>make the same wise choice. But first of all we need to see that choice as an<br>investment rather than a cost,&quot; said Dr Ryan.</p>
<p>TERTIARY EDUCATION WON&#39;T MAKE YOU RICH - IN NEW ZEALAND</p>
<p>A series of indicators released by the Ministry of Education last month<br>shows that New Zealanders who gain a tertiary education qualification can<br>expect a substantially smaller return on their investment, in terms of<br>earning potential, than students in other countries.</p>
<p>Average earnings in 2007 for New Zealanders with a tertiary education are 21<br>percent higher, compared to those with only upper secondary and<br>post-secondary non-tertiary education. This is lower than equivalent figures<br>for Australia (31 percent) and considerably lower than the OECD average<br>across 25 countries of 52 percent. In 2007, both the United States (72<br>percent) and the United Kingdom (57 percent) had very high premiums for<br>tertiary education over these lower levels education.</p>
<p>The ministry states that this is important because the success of an<br>education system is manifested in, amongst other things, the success of<br>individuals in finding sustainable employment as well as the level of wages<br>that employers are willing to pay for the skills and knowledge that the<br>individual brings to a job.</p>
<p>&quot;These labour market advantages are an important outcome of education. They<br>may even be the primary economic and social outcome, because earned income<br>enables people to achieve a higher standard of living and many of the other<br>individual and national outcomes associated with education may accrue either<br>directly or indirectly from higher incomes.&quot;</p>
<p>MINISTRY UNLIKELY TO REACH PASIFIKA TERTIARY EDUCATION TARGET</p>
<p>The Pasifika Education Plan: Monitoring Report 2008 published by the<br>Ministry of Education at the end of last year, sets a target to increase the<br>completion rates for young Pasifika people in tertiary education. However,<br>its target is still significantly lower than the existing completion rates<br>for young non-Pasifika people.</p>
<p>The ministry is aiming to raise the five-year completion rates for Pasifika<br>people aged 18 to 24 in qualifications at levels four and above from 37<br>percent of those first enrolled in 2004 to 43 percent of those first<br>enrolled in 2008. The five year completion rate for non-Pasifika people of<br>the same age first enrolled in 2004 is significantly over 50 percent.</p>
<p>The ministry notes in its report that it needs to change its approach if it<br>is to reach this target:</p>
<p>&quot;While the New Zealand recession is likely to increase the retention rate<br>for young Pasifika students in the foreseeable future as younger people find<br>it harder to gain employment when the labour market weakens, it is unlikely<br>that the target will be met without some form of intervention.&quot;</p>
<p>In fact, the ministry estimates that without intervention the completion<br>rate is likely to be just 39 percent.</p>
<p>The report also notes that the participation rate by Pasifika students in<br>postgraduate-level study continued to increase. The Pasifika participation<br>rate in postgraduate study has risen from 0.40 percent in 2001 to 0.58<br>percent in 2008. It now is forecast to reach 0.72 percent by 2012, lower<br>than the previous target of one percent by 2012.</p>
