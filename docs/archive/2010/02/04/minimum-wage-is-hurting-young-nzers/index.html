<p><strong>Minimum Wage Is Hurting Young NZers</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s very rich of Labour&#39;s Annette King to blame National for the high rate of unemployment for young New Zealanders when it is, in fact, Labour&#39;s abolition of youth rates that has caused this problem, ACT Finance Spokesman Sir Roger Douglas said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Since youth rates were abolished in early 2008, the unemployment rate for 15-19 year-olds has almost doubled. The number of unemployed youth has risen by 18,800 people,&quot; Sir Roger said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is pretty clear what is causing this to happen – if you look at the 10-year period before the abolition of youth rates, youth unemployment peaked at 15.9 percent. Today, it stands at 26.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;An excessive minimum wage denies young people the opportunity to get a job, as employers cannot afford to hire them. When unemployed, they can&#39;t gain work experience, don&#39;t receive on-the-job training, and never develop a work ethic.</p>
<p>&quot;If Annette King really cared about those young people who cannot find a job, she would end support for the policies that Labour voted for that caused it.</p>
<p>Instead, she seems to think the solution is make-work schemes paid for by the taxpayer or hiding the problem by allowing more to become students.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has caused the excessive rise in youth unemployment and now wants taxpayers to pick up the tab,&quot; Sir Roger said.</p>
