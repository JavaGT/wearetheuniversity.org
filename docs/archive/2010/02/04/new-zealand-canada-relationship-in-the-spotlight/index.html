<p><strong>New Zealand-Canada Relationship in the spotlight</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand’s “little brother” complex is about to be talked about with a friend who knows how we feel.</p>
<p>Living in the shadow of a bigger, brasher neighbour is something New Zealand and Canada share in common. Yet the comparisons and similarities go much deeper than our shared national angst.</p>
<p>An international conference next week in Wellington will explore an important diplomatic relationship that often goes under the radar.</p>
<p>&quot;Canada and New Zealand: Connections, Comparisons and Challenges&quot;, celebrates 70 years of diplomatic relations between Canada and New Zealand and brings several high profile speakers, including Justice Joseph Williams from the New Zealand High Court, to Victoria University’s Government Buildings on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>Organised by Victoria University, the High Commission of Canada in New Zealand, and the New Zealand Institute of International Affairs, the conference will reflect on the strong parallels between the countries, and how they interact on a global stage.<br>One of the conference organisers, Victoria University’s Dr Fiona Barker, says the comparisons are so striking that it’s surprising they haven’t been explored in such depth before.<br>“We are both moderately small countries that are often in the shadow of bigger neighbours. We share similar settler histories, and similar indigenous issues. The debates about national identity and biculturalism versus multiculturalism are also the same. This is the first conference to really explore that.”</p>

<p>Dr Barker says a highlight of the conference will be a panel led by Raymond Chrétien, former Canadian Ambassador to the United States, and Simon Murdoch, New Zealand’s recently retired Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade, discussing the parallels between the Canada-US and New Zealand-Australia relationship.</p>
<p>Another highlight will be a public speech from the High Court’s Justice Joseph Williams on the search for national identity in Canada and New Zealand in the context of a fading Empire.  </p>
<p>Event co-organiser, Victoria University’s Dr David Capie, says he hopes the conference will draw attention to a diplomatic relationship that is extremely productive, but largely taken for granted.</p>
<p>“Perhaps it goes under the radar because we have so much in common and there is very little conflict in the relationship. But given the nature of our history and our closest neighbours, we share so many of the same challenges and opportunities. I’m hoping this conference will draw attention to that.”</p>
