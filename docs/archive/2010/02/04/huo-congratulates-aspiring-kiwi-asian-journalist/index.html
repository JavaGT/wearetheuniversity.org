<p><strong>Thursday, 4 February 2010, 3:02 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Huo Congratulates Aspiring Kiwi-Asian Journalist</strong></p>
<p><strong>Labour Associate Ethnic Affairs spokesperson Raymond Huo has congratulated Corazon Miller for being the inaugural recipient of the Asia New Zealand Foundation Kiwi-Asian Journalism Scholarship.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“As the first recipient of this scholarship, Corazon Miller will lead the way for other aspiring Kiwi-Asian journalists who may wish to contribute in this modern era of bridge building across cultures and countries,” said Raymond Huo.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“With a growing Asian population in New Zealand and a strengthening business market, it is vitally important for us to promote understanding and familiarity with Asia and its people,” Raymond Huo said.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Ethnic minorities need to have their voice and opinions heard in the mainstream media in order to provide an easier transition into New Zealand society. This initiative will promote inter-community understanding and help prepare newly-arrived Kiwi-Asians to become contributing members of society.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corazon Miller, of Filipino and New Zealand European descent, has enrolled in a Post Graduate Diploma in Communications Studies with a Journalism Major at AUT University in Auckland. The Scholarship will pay up to $5000 on completion of Ms Miller’s journalism study.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“I want to encourage all Kiwi-Asians with a passion for Journalism to follow Miss Miller into a career in journalism,” Raymond Huo said.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“With a large and growing Asian population in New Zealand, it is important that we have a base of Asian journalists who can effectively communicate Asian issues in the media.</strong></p>

<p>“I must also commend the Asia-NZ Foundation for this fantastic initiative which will have ongoing benefits for the Asian community in New Zealand.”</p>
<p>The Kiwi-Asian Journalism Scholarship is designed to attract more young Kiwi-Asians into journalism study and to encourage increased representation of Asian communities in mainstream journalism. Applications for the 2011 scholarship will open in August.</p>
