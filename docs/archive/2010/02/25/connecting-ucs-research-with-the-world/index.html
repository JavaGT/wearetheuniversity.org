<p><strong>Connecting UC’s research with the world</strong></p>
<p>The University of Canterbury has officially launched its new Research &amp; Innovation (R&amp;I) unit which supports all stages of research and innovation development, from initial funding through to commercialisation.</p>
<p>R&amp;I&#39;s Director, Dr Nigel Johnson, says the unit has assumed responsibility for services previously provided by the Research &amp; Consultancy unit and UC&#39;s commercialisation company Canterprise, which were integrated following an extensive review of research and commercialisation systems at the University.</p>
<p>&quot;We aim to maximise the quantity and quality of UC’s research, to identify the great new ideas emerging from that research, and then develop and transfer as many of those ideas as we can to those who can use or benefit from them. Our priority is to maximise the beneficial impact of the University’s research, but of course we will be seeking a fair return for the University’s intellectual property,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;R&amp;I’s catchphrase is &#39;Connecting UC’s research with the world&#39; because we provide the systems and services for the interface between the University’s research capabilities and activities and the external world, from research grant processes, solving industry problems via consultancies, to transferring new intellectual property into the market, and the detailed reporting of our research capabilities and outputs.</p>
<p>&quot;R&amp;I is the bridge between the academic researcher, their research funders and the potential users of their research. Building on UC’s already strong research reputation, our goal is to enhance the contribution that UC’s research makes to New Zealand and our global community.&quot;</p>

<p>“We are delighted that four prominent business-people and entrepreneurs have agreed to serve on our newly formed Technology Transfer Committee. These external advisors will guide the transfer of new intellectual property arising from UC’s research. “</p>
<p>The committee members are Bill Lee, R&amp;I’s Commercial Advisor; Dennis Chapman, director and chief designer for Enatel Ltd - a Christchurch-based company which designs and manufactures standby power solutions; Elizabeth Hopkins, a former CEO of Wool Equities Ltd; and Bruce Gordon, a member of the Group Leadership Team at PGG Wrightson.</p>
<p>Dr Johnson is an internationally recognised expert in the management of textile research and commercialisation. In the past four years he has held a number of senior positions at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), one of the largest and most diverse research organisations in the world with 6300 staff and a budget of A$1 billion.</p>
