<p>New Zealand’s brightest designers invited to shed light on a greener future</p>
<p>WWF-New Zealand has teamed up with Massey University and some of the country’s leading designers, architects and artists to launch an innovative new green design competition as part of this year’s Earth Hour.</p>
<p>The Eco-innovations competition aims to celebrate and communicate the critical thinking and creative practices that can lead us down the path to a more sustainable future.</p>
<p>Creative design students from Massey University in Wellington are encouraged to submit a work – such as an object, event, photo, installation, animation, or a graphic– that proposes social innovations or objects, systems or spaces that do not exceed the planet’s capacity to sustain us.</p>
<p>The panel of expert judges includes 2009 NZ Arts Foundation Laureate, photographer Anne Noble, award winning Wellington architect Ian Athfield, innovative furniture designer David Trubridge and fashion designer and sustainable businesswoman Laurie Foon.</p>
<p>WWF Executive Director Chris Howe said: “Earth Hour is a great way to demonstrate your support for the planet. We’re asking as many Kiwis as possible to take part this year by turning off your lights and any unnecessary appliances for one hour on 27 March at 8.30pm. And to use this symbolic gesture as a starting point to ‘switch’ to more sustainable ways of living, so that every hour is Earth Hour.”</p>
<p>Anne Noble, 2009 NZ Arts Foundation Laureate, said: “The Eco-innovations competition is a way to showcase the importance of innovative design thinking to the creation of a more sustainable future We are looking for the outcomes of bright young designers approaching innovation and sustainability through thinking critically and creating new kinds of design artifacts, objects, processes, textiles, fashion designs, films, photographs and communication strategies. We want to see imaginations at play, creative and sustainable new uses of materials and processes as well as the innovative re-use of existing products or materials.”</p>
<p>Chris Howe concluded: “Eco-innovations is a hugely exciting and important initiative because it calls on New Zealand&#39;s young creative minds to shed light on a more sustainable future. This Earth Hour, we want to find out who will shine the brightest when the lights go off.”</p>
