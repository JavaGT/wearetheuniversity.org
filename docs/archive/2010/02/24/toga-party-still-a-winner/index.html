<p>Otago University Students’ Association<br>Official Media Release<br>24 February 2010<br>Attention: Reporters<br>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>Toga Party still a Winner</p>
<p>The OUSA Toga Party, the most popular event on the OUSA Orientation calendar, went very well last night.</p>
<p>“As it always does” noted Otago University Students’ (OUSA) President Harriet Geoghegan.</p>
<p>The Toga Party, which involves OUSA members dressing toga-style in sheets to attend a concert in the University’s Union Building, sold out earlier in the day. The 1700 lucky enough to secure tickets spent the rest of the day sourcing sheets from second hand shops and ASCO towel service and strings of ivy for those important wreaths.</p>
<p>After having enjoyed a sports day at Logan Park in the fine Dunedin weather, students arrived at the venue in droves.<br>Geoghegan congratulates the Colleges, who put a great amount of effort in to ensuring students were well behaved, were escorted to the Union Hall safely and had alternative entertainment before the party.</p>
<p>OUSA has put in a massive amount of work to encourage responsible drinking, said Geoghegan.</p>
<p>“We are running a promotion (&#39;Power Up to win a Nintendo Wii,&#39;) to encourage our members to eat a meal before going out. As every year, there are student peers from the OUSA Executive at every gig to ensure students drink responsibly and to provide safe transport home when needed. We also have free food, water bottles, St John&#39;s and adequate security at every gig.”</p>
<p>The tradition of egging the participants in a Toga Parade did not carry over into the queues waiting to get into the Toga Party.</p>

<p>“Some members of the public and senior students half-heartedly attempted to ambush the first years with eggs and water bombs, but they were quickly moved on by Campus Watch and the Campus Cop.”</p>
<p>While there was no Toga Parade this year, first year students were welcomed to the City by Dunedin Mayor Peter Chin and OUSA President Harriet Geoghegan on Monday. In the afternoon students attended a &#39;Unismart&#39; lecture to introduce them to University life and some of the challenges faced, such as alcohol and drug consumption.</p>
<p>“We see this lead to some good decision making and responsible drinking on the night of the toga party and a really happy, positive event.”</p>
