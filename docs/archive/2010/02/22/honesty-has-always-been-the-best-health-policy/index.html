<p><strong>Monday, 22 February 2010, 10:55 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Honesty has always been the best Health Policy</strong></p>
<p>Minister of Health Tony Ryall cannot be trusted to speak the truth on doctor training nor on doctor numbers if his comments this morning are anything to go by, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.</p>
<p>&quot;His pronouncement that he inherited a doctor shortage from Labour could not be further from the truth which is that Labour created 80 more doctor training places while the previous National government created none,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>“When Labour came to power in 1999 we had 285 medical student places at Otago and Auckland Universities. That number had not increased for two decades.</p>
<p>Health Minister Annette King approved 40 more places in 2004 and Health Minister Pete Hodgson approved another 40 places in 2008 – bringing the total to 365 New Zealanders in their first year of medical training. More medical graduates are now training to become General Practitioners too.</p>
<p>“In 2006, the number of postgraduate GP training places was increased from 54 to 69, and in 2008 104 graduates were in their first year of General Practice training.</p>
<p>&quot;Since National became government we have had a health cut somewhere in New Zealand each week while Mr Ryall chatters on about things getting better.</p>
<p>“I am concerned that Mr Ryall’s decision to blatantly mislead on doctor numbers is an attempt to cover up for his lack of a plan when it comes to work force issues.</p>
<p>“I understand that this year’s budget will see a raft of budget cuts, not least of which will be a $350 million cut in expected health funding.</p>
<p>“How will New Zealand recruit and retain doctors or nurses if it doesn’t pay them at reasonable levels or fund hospital and equipment upgrades,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
