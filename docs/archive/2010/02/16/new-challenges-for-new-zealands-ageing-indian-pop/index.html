<p><strong>New challenges for New Zealand’s ageing Indian population</strong></p>
<p>Expectations of older people moving from India to be with their families in New Zealand are often not being met.</p>
<p>The challenges they face uncover a new set of issues that the Government needs to address more urgently in its New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy, according to three Victoria University researchers.</p>
<p>Judith Davey, Sally Keeling and Arvind Zodgekar from Victoria’s Institute of Policy Studies say the challenges these older Indian people face, such as adapting to a new society and a new family environment, require improved coordination between central government agencies and community groups.</p>
<p>“Although the Government’s Strategy does support the provision of culturally appropriate services to older people, these have been slow to develop,” says researcher Judith Davey.</p>
<p>The researchers examined the issues of ageing Indian migrants by talking to the leaders of interest groups in the Indian community in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, and through family case studies.</p>
<p>“Frequently the older people are left to themselves during the day while the next generation is at work,” says Ms Davey.</p>
<p>“Language problems and lack of transport can make matters worse.</p>
<p>“Many older Indians feel dependent on their adult children but, like older people in other ethnic groups, they ‘do not want to be a burden’. So many suffer isolation and loneliness, even through their situation is not what they expected when they moved in with their families.”</p>

<p>The tension between the traditional way of doing things and New Zealand culture can also be problematic.</p>
<p>“Wives may resent their live-in in-laws, and when grandparents care for grandchildren there can be different views on child-rearing,” says Ms Davey.</p>
<p>“Culturally-based patriarchal attitudes can also create problems in modern New Zealand.”</p>
<p>The tendency for both men and women to work, can also make it difficult to provide care at home for people with severe disabilities.</p>
<p>“Residential care is beginning to be considered, although we found there was considerable resistance to the idea by both the younger and older generations.</p>
<p>“With more than 106,000 Indian immigrants in New Zealand now, it’s a significant population.</p>
<p>“We need to ensure this group—and indeed older people from other migrant communities—are getting the best support possible as they age.”</p>
