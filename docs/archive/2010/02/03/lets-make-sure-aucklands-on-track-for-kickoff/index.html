<p>**Let’s make sure Auckland’s on track for kickoff<br>**</p>
<p>Labour’s Mount Albert MP David Shearer believes there are valid questions around the ability of Auckland’s transport system to cope with Rugby World Cup volumes and they need to be answered.</p>
<p>“RWC 2011 is going to be a major event and ensuring we get things like transport right is going to be a big factor in its success,” David Shearer said.</p>
<p>“For that reason the issues raised in a report by the Auckland Regional Transport Authority should be addressed properly.</p>
<p>“Integrated ticketing is one issue where we can not let local issues impact on making travel simple for RWC visitors.</p>
<p>“I will find it very ironic that if in 2011 we have completed the Victoria Park tunnel but haven’t managed to agree on letting punters get to and from games with one simple ticket.”</p>
<p>David Shearer says National also needs to rethink its go slow approach to the electrification of the rail network.</p>
<p>“I realise Steven Joyce is in love with motorways but when 60,000 rugby fans are heading to Eden Park in my electorate plenty are going to want to use the train to get there,” David Shearer said.</p>
<p>“Will the regular signalling and points problems experienced on the rail network finally be fixed once and for all by the time of the RWC?</p>
<p>“And what if something goes wrong? Is there a back up plan?</p>
<p>“With some leadership on these and other issues New Zealand can avoid the usual pre event coverage where workmen battle until the 11th hour to get things finished.</p>
<p>“Kiwis want the RWC to be a success in every respect. Let’s make sure that we can get to the games safely and on time, especially the final. Fingers crossed,”</p>
