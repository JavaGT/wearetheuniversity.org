<p>Labour urges government to listen on special education</p>
<p>Labour has welcomed the release of the Government’s consultation document on the review of special education and is urging it to take seriously the submissions of parents, students and other interested parties.</p>
<p>Special Education spokesperson Grant Robertson and Disability spokesperson Lynne Pillay said the Government should keep an open mind on the best way forward for special education.</p>
<p>“Labour believes the review represents an opportunity to develop a truly inclusive education system that upholds the legislated right for every child to have a public education,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>“The consultation document talks a lot about choice. There needs to be a genuine choice for parents to send their child to their local school if that is what they want.</p>
<p>“In this regard, it is very important that there are positive outcomes from the review in terms of the training of teachers and curriculum development that supports inclusive education in all schools.</p>
<p>“However, we are disappointed that the consultation document rules out any feedback that involves increasing the funding for special education.</p>
<p>“Increased funding is not the only answer, but it should not be ruled out from the word go.&quot;</p>
<p>Grant Robertson said the review should be able to consider the full educational experience, including early childhood and post compulsory education.</p>
<p>“Learning for life is as important for special education students as it is for everyone else.</p>
<p>“Labour hopes the Minister will not use the review to push ACT&#39;s ideological barrow about vouchers for education. The review must be about what works best for students to achieve their potential,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
