<p><strong>Step change is a step backwards</strong></p>
<p>The “Step Change” report on Education misses the point that the only real way to lift educational performance is to address underlying inequality, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>The report recommends a voucher system which would allow the parents and families of the top 5 percent and bottom 20 percent of students to move their children to different schools.</p>
<p>“The report ignores the fact that educational performance is primarily influenced in the home, not at school,” Green Party Education Spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said.</p>
<p>“The biggest influence on how well kids do at school is their family background. They do best if they come from a home with a decent income, with family members who value education and had a positive education experience themselves.</p>
<p>“Too many kiwi kids don’t live in a home like that. Many are coming to school hungry. Until we address inequality, moving vulnerable kids around to different schools will only disrupt their learning,” Ms Delahunty said.</p>
<p>Ms Delahunty said the report identified some great schools where good work was being done to address the learning needs of both gifted and underperforming kids.</p>
<p>“But rather than pulling kids out of their schools and concentrating all our attention on a few schools, we should be modelling the success of these schools across the board.”</p>
<p>Ms Delahunty said the report was thinly veiled Act policy.</p>
<p>“It’s a real worry that Act seems to be driving the Government’s agenda in education. This is radical right-wing policy in disguise as a cross-party report.</p>

<p>“The legitimate Maori Party concern that schools need to be more culturally appropriate can be addressed without a voucher system. Cultural appropriateness should be a goal of all schools,” Ms Delahunty said.</p>
<p>Ms Delahunty was also concerned that the report proposed to use flawed new National Standards as the measure for determining who would have access to the voucher system.</p>
<p>“Many parents and teachers have grave concerns about National Standards. They are worried that reporting the results in league tables could undermine schools in vulnerable communities. Combining this with a voucher system that privileges well-resourced private schools will be a disaster for public education,” Ms Delahunty said.</p>
