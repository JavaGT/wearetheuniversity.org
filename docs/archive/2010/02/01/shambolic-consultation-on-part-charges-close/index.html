<p>Shambolic Consultation On Part Charges Closes This Week</p>
<p>The shambles that has been the consultation on part charges into the public sector draws to a close this week, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.</p>
<p>“The proposal seeks to give people with the ability to pay access to a wider range of hospital services provided in public hospitals than those who can’t afford to pay,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>“I continue to be concerned about the proposal providing preferential treatment for paying patients, but I am also deeply troubled by the appalling way in which the supposed consultation for this proposal has been handled.</p>
<p>“On Thursday the Otago DHB released a press statement entitled ‘patients support top-up treatments’ and claiming they only ever intended the proposal to be for cancer patients.</p>
<p>“Releasing a document claiming that patients support the proposal before the consultation has finished is nothing more than a blatant attempt to make people believe this is a patient led initiative. I also find it simply incompetent to release information five days before the consultation has finished claiming its about purchasing cancer drugs to save lives.</p>
<p>“The original ‘Bridging the Gap’ document makes it quite clear that Southland and Otago DHBs are considering this proposal to charge patients for additional services through their hospitals.</p>
<p>“This consultation has been so poorly handled there is no way it can be taken seriously, and the Minister of Health should step in to prevent these charges going ahead.</p>
<p>“So far senior doctors and nurses have spoken out against this ‘two tier’ health system proposal and the calls for it to be scrapped will only get louder.”</p>
