<p><strong>Friday, 26 February 2010, 1:48 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Eclectic composer comes home as New Zealand School of Music Composer in Residence</strong>  </p>
<p>Chris Gendall, who counts standup comedy, sports events and composers of the 60s and 70s as some of his musical influences, returns to Wellington as the Creative New Zealand/Jack C. Richards ComposerinResidence.</p>
<p>The prestigious yearlong residency is cosponsored by Creative New Zealand and Dr Jack C. Richards and hosted by the New Zealand School of Music, a joint venture between Victoria and Massey Universities.</p>
<p>The resident is also offered the use of the former home of Douglas Lilburn in Thorndon by the Lilburn Residence Trust, a notforprofit organisation. Currently in the United States having been artistresident at the Banff Centre, New York, Mr Gendall is looking forward to returning to New Zealand for the 20102011 position and, in particular, working with Wellington musicians.</p>
<p>“It’ll be wonderful to be back in my home town and an honour to follow in the footsteps of previous composersinresidence, whom I greatly admire.</p>
<p>“I&#39;m also looking forward to once again being immersed in Wellington&#39;s music community. I’m really excited about connecting and reconnecting with performers and ensembles throughout the country.”</p>
<p>Mr Gendall plans to work on a range of projects during his time at the New Zealand School of Music including potentially a new work for orchestra. He notes his influences as “a little tough to describe”.</p>
<p>“I have a fondness for composers of the 1960s and ‘70s and, lately, have found myself drawn to the diverse emotional states from standup comedy, Richard Strauss tone poems, sports events and pop music.”</p>

<p>Dr Jack C. Richards who jointly sponsors the residency with Creative New Zealand says that the 29yearold will be a wonderful addition to local composition.</p>
<p>“He’s young and vibrant, and the residency gives him the opportunity to fully pursue his creative activities. I wish him well and look forward to hearing his work.”</p>
<p>Mr Gendall completed his undergraduate and Masters studies at Victoria University between 1999 and 2004, after which he moved to the US for doctoral studies at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. At Victoria, he studied with many wellknown musicians and composers including John Psathas and Jack Body.</p>
