<p><strong>Thursday, 11 February 2010, 2:35 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>**Aussie Unemployment Trend Shows Benefits Of Having A Plan<br>**<br>Australians are reaping the benefits of their Government having a clear plan to weather the recession with their unemployment level falling for the fourth consecutive month, Labour Leader Phil Goff said today.</p>
<p>“In contrast John Key’s lack of a plan to keep the Kiwi economy moving has seen unemployment reach a 16 year high, jumping 0.8% in the last quarter to 7.3%,” Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>“168,000 Kiwis are now unemployed and National has done little to help protect or create jobs. New Zealand’s unemployment rate is now over a third higher than across the Tasman.</p>
<p>“Kevin Rudd in Australia committed the Australian Labour Government to tackling unemployment as a priority and developed a plan and a stimulus package to do so.</p>
<p>“In New Zealand all we have had is the rhetoric of the Jobs Summit, and the impact of the last Labour budget which did provide stimulation to counteract the international downturn.”</p>
<p>Phil Goff says Australians are now benefiting from their Government’s approach by going back to work in their thousands.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately for Kiwis, National party inaction has meant uncertainty still looms around the job market,” Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>“That is the reality that thousands of Kiwis are living because of John Key’s lack of commitment to any plan to keep Kiwis in work.</p>
<p>“Australia has enjoyed a Government that has been proactive, has stimulated the economy and has committed itself to investing more in skills training and education.</p>

<p>“Instead of making jobs his priority, John Key has made breaking his election promises his priority.</p>
<p>“How many jobs will be created by hiking GST up to 15%? Why didn’t we hear how John Key’s GST plan will create jobs earlier this week?</p>
<p>“Kiwis struggling to make ends meet will be looking across the Tasman and seeing unemployment falling while at home their Prime Minister wants to lift GST to 15%.</p>
<p>“You can’t blame them for wanting to scratch their heads.”</p>
