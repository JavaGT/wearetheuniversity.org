<p><strong>Ryall labels frontline health cuts as ‘changes’</strong></p>
<p>While the Health Minister Tony Ryall continues to make statements about increasing frontline health services, the public are experiencing just the opposite and he has even gone as far as to try to re-label the cuts as ‘changes’, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.</p>
<p>“Thousands of older Kiwis have been &#39;reassessed&#39; as not needing their home support or needing less home support.<br>“Tony Ryall repeats a mantra each week about increasing frontline health services, diverting resources to the frontline or delivering health care to people closer to home.</p>
<p>“What could be closer to home than two or three hours supporting an older person with heavier housework which otherwise may put them at risk of injury?” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>“I have heard reports from older people, their families and carers, nurses, Grey Power, Age Concern, and District Health Board staff who are shocked at what is happening. Many times the &#39;reassessments&#39; are by stealth when a DHB staff member rings and asks if someone is coping at home. What independent person would answer no, and why is this being done over the phone?</p>
<p>&quot;This is both a false economy and an insult to independent older people. Many who are brave enough to complain are having their phone assessment decisions reversed.</p>
<p>“Last year 71-year-old Marlene Bennett from Christchurch lost her 1.5 hours of domestic help a week following a phone interview, despite having just 40 per cent mobility. She has since been reassessed in person and had one hour reinstated.</p>
<p>“Nothing that this Government has done adds up to anything other than Get Less and Pay More. Tony Ryall has promised savings of $700 million over five years in Health which he will divert to the frontline but when you examine the detail the first potential for savings are years down the track. Meantime, there will only be cuts at the frontline and anger at the Minister’s attempts to hoodwink the public.</p>
<p>“Just ask these older Kiwis if health services are increasing for them?” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
