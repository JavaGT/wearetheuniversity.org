<p><strong>Key’s Speech rings Alarm Bells for Students</strong></p>
<p>Harriet Geoghegan, OUSA President, is trying to get the best out of John Key’s speech but it is full of alarms for the students she represents.</p>
<p>“It is good to see the government making that link between bright young minds in tertiary education and the positive impact on the economy” she said. “However we would have liked to have seen more incentives for graduates to remain in New Zealand”</p>
<p>Of more pressing concern for Geoghegan are the indications that fees could rise and loans and allowances restrict access to study.</p>
<p>“Allusions to cuts in tertiary funding are worrying. An increase to fees maxima will present a serious barrier to students’ ability to access tertiary education – and this is not going to help our economy prosper.”</p>
<p>Geoghegan notes that there is an influx of people returning to study as a result of job losses and the economic downturn, including graduates who seek further qualifications to equip them for heading back out to the workforce. She finds it insulting that Mr Key does not think students take their studies seriously.</p>
<p>“The tertiary environment is a tough one to adjust to. Studying IS a full time job, and many of our members also have part time jobs to support themselves which adds to the stress.<br>Penalising students who are already struggling, instead of assisting them to stay in the game, is not going to help. We should not be penalising New Zealanders who want to upskill themselves”</p>
<p>Geoghegan believes student associations have a more crucial role to play now more than ever.</p>
<p>“We provide student support at a cost the government and the university never could because of all our volunteers and dedicated staff. Student Associations are often the difference between students making it and falling by the wayside.”</p>
