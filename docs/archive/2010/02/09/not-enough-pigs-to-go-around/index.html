<p><strong>Not enough pigs to go around – an international study</strong></p>
<p>“Globally, consumption of all meat, including pig meat, is increasing and will continue to do so in the future,” says Sajee Kunhareang, a PhD student in the Faculty of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Lincoln University.</p>
<p>A Thai national, on secondment in New Zealand, Sajee is using DNA technology to undertake a study to identify and understand the function of genes associated with muscle (meat) growth in pigs.</p>
<p>“In countries like Thailand, pig meat is a critical source of protein,” said Sajee, “but as a country we are not producing enough meat or high enough quality meat to feed our people.”</p>
<p>Sajee’s research will also benefit the pig industry in New Zealand where producers are working hard to provide quality pork for local consumers.</p>
<p>Muscle growth is critical to the pig industry because if the pigs have larger muscles there will be a subsequent increase in meat production over time. It is important, however, that the muscle size of the animal increases rather than the fat content.</p>
<p>“Producing muscle uses less energy than producing fat so it is cheaper, in terms of energy, for the animal and also in monetary terms, for the farmer, to produce a leaner, healthier” product, said Sajee.</p>
<p>“My results will benefit pig producers as they strive to produce a premier product to meet customer demands while still remaining profitable.”</p>

<p>Based on samples taken from commercial pig farms in New Zealand and Thailand, preliminary results have shown that there are, indeed, naturally-occurring genetic differences between a “run of the mill pig” in terms of muscle size and those with larger muscles. Other results show that this genetic variation might have an important role in growth rate, fat deposition and piglet survival as well.</p>
<p>“I am delighted that some of Sajee’s research has already been published in an international journal,” said Associate Professor Jon Hickford of Lincoln University, Sajee’s PhD supervisor.</p>
<p>“This research has the potential to make a significant contribution to factors affecting pork production and quality throughout the world, especially in those countries where pig-meat is a critical source of protein, but it will also benefit the local industry here in New Zealand.”</p>
<p>“I am pleased to have this opportunity to collaborate with Thailand’s Khon Kaen University in training their staff,” said Dr Hickford.</p>
<p>Sajee came to New Zealand from her position as a lecturer in the Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Khon Kaen University.</p>
