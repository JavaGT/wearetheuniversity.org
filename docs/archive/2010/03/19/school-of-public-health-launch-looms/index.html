<p><strong>Friday, March 19, 2010</strong><br><strong>School of Public Health launch looms</strong>  </p>
<p>Confronting the biggest health issues faced by New Zealand societies is the basis for the University&#39;s new School of Public Health that will be officially launched in Wellington on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The school encompasses five research centres that are at the forefront of increasing expertise and understanding of the impacts of alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs, non-communicable diseases such as asthma, industrial and occupational diseases and cancers, as well as health issues that impact most severely on particular populations groups, such as Maori and Pacific Islanders.</p>
<p>The centres all focus on research but also provide supervision for doctoral students and others seeking postgraduate qualifications. They are:<br>The Social and Health Outcome Research and Evaluation Centre, known as the SHORE Centre, led by Professor Sally Casswell and based in Auckland.<br>Te Ropu Whariki, led by Dr Helen Moewaka Barnes, also based in Auckland.<br>The Centre for Public Health Research, led by Professor Neil Pearce, based in Wellington.<br>The Sleep/Wake Research Centre, led by Professor Philippa Gander, based in Wellington.<br>The Research Centre for Maori Health and Development, led by Professor Chris Cunningham, based in Wellington and Manawatu.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Cindy Kiro, a former Children’s Commissioner and previously a Massey public health researcher who specialises in health policy and social determinants of health, is heading the school.</p>
<p>Dr Kiro says public health research plays a crucial role in addressing major health problems including cancer, asthma, respiratory infections and health inequalities.</p>
<p>“Massey University’s school is based on different disciplines working together to improve our understanding of health and prevention of disease.”  </p>
