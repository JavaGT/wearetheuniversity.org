<p>**Higher travel costs signalled for the elderly<br>**</p>
<p>The review of the SuperGold Card scheme signals cuts to travel subsidies for the elderly, Labour’s Transport spokesperson Darren Hughes said today.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s announcement by Transport Minister Steven Joyce foreshadowing cuts to the scheme is another broken promise by Prime Minister John Key, coming after Mr Key&#39;s recent flip flop on raising GST, Darren Hughes said.</p>
<p>“In March 2009, John Key described it as &#39;a successful programme … and we will be funding the increase&#39;. Mr Joyce also said at the time that the Government had allocated $72 million for the scheme over four years … and &#39;at this stage we are not concerned it will exceed that&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that appears to have changed.</p>
<p>&quot;A review that improves the scheme is one thing, but the language used in the announcement points to cuts,&quot; Darren Hughes said.</p>
<p>&quot;This latest u-turn is another blow for older New Zealanders, who are also seeing their home care cut, higher power bills and a rise to GST.</p>
<p>&quot;One has to wonder what National has got against our senior citizens.</p>
<p>“The SuperGold Card scheme allows hundreds of thousands of older New Zealanders to access free public transport at off peak times, helping them attend medical appointments and visit friends and relatives.</p>
<p>“Labour urges groups such as Grey Power and Age Concern to make their voices heard during the consultation process,” Darren Hughes said.</p>
