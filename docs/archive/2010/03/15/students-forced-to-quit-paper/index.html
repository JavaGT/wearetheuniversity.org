<p><strong>Students forced to quit paper</strong></p>
<p>By Angela Mabey</p>
<p>VUWSA is keeping their eye on Victoria University after students were advised they should withdraw from a course they were entitled to take.</p>
<p>VUWSA president Max Hardy told <em>Salient</em> that students who had enrolled, and had their fees paid for FREN112 were told in their second tutorial that they had to drop out of the course.</p>
<p><em>Salient</em> understands the students were told they were not able to complete the beginners course because they had completed NCEA level 1 French—one student completing it over four years prior.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no restrictions or course requirements listed for this paper, yet they were told they were not able to continue in FREN112,&quot; Hardy says.</p>
<p>Online information for the course on the Victoria University website clearly states &quot;Restrictions: None&quot;.</p>
<p>One student received conflicting information in an email from a senior department member saying there were restrictions on entry to the course.</p>
<p>&quot;If you had [discussed course entry] I would have been able to confirm in simple terms the particular restrictions placed on enrolments in FREN112.&quot;</p>
<p>The French language course structure allows students to skip course requirements, should they wish to. However, it does not state that students must take this course of action.</p>
<p>After students went to VUWSA with their concerns, VUWSA acted as the students&#39; advocate and had them enrolled back in the paper.</p>
<p>The department member went on to say the student&#39;s actions in complaining about the directive to withdraw from the course were &quot;reprehensible&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;…Treating the situation as one of injustice to yourself, rather than one that relates to maintaining high standards in the classroom and a positive learning attitude amongst your fellow students is reprehensible.&quot;</p>
<p>Hardy is concerned that other students may have encountered negative situations and not contacted VUWSA for advocacy support.</p>
<p>&quot;Lecturers can be intimidating for first years.</p>
<p>&quot;Student should always come to VUWSA with their concerns so that we can give them advice and support if required.</p>
<p>&quot;This French situation is an example of the importance of independent advocacy.&quot;</p>
<p>Victoria University declined to comment on issues relating to specific students.</p>
