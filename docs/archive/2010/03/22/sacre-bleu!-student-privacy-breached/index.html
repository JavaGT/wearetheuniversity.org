<p><strong>Sacre bleu! Student privacy breached</strong><br>French Dept. Oversteps the Maginot Line</p>
<p><em>Sarah Robson</em></p>
<p>A senior Victoria University lecturer has breached student privacy by accessing a student’s records for non-academic purposes.</p>
<p><em>Salient</em> News Editor Angela Mabey’s student records were accessed last week by Senior Lecturer in French Dr Myreille Pawliez.</p>
<p>The breach of privacy came to light after Pawliez sent an email to Mabey’s personal email address to respond to a story appearing in the last issue of <em>Salient</em>.</p>
<p>When questioned by Mabey, Pawliez admitted that she had accessed Mabey’s student records to find her email address.</p>
<p>Mabey says her <em>Salient</em> email address is freely available in the magazine and on the <em>Salient</em> website. She is disappointed a lecturer has breached her privacy.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not, and have never been, enrolled in a paper in the French department.</p>
<p>&quot;This lecturer accessed my student record for a completely inappropriate reason.&quot;</p>
<p>Pawliez is the course coordinator for FREN112. <em>Salient</em> last week reported that some students in FREN112 were told they had to withdraw from the course because they had completed some NCEA French credits.</p>
<p>Online course information says there are no restrictions placed on entry to the course.</p>
<p>The students were re-enrolled in the course after they sought advocacy support from VUWSA.</p>
<p>“The university has very clear internal protocols regarding the accessing and use of information held in student records, and this is an issue I view extremely seriously,” says Professor Deborah Willis, Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean for the Humanities and Social Sciences Faculty Office.</p>
<p>“I am investigating these allegations to see whether or not there has been a breach of university protocols.”</p>
<p>VUWSA President Max Hardy says that the use of student records for non-academic purposes is “totally inappropriate” and it is an issue that VUWSA will be following up.</p>
<p><em>Salient</em> will follow this story as the investigation continues.</p>
