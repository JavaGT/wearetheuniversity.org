<p><strong>Thursday, March 25, 2010</strong><br><strong>Guest lecture to put modern photography in focus</strong>  </p>
<p>German photographer Thomas Ruff is the guest presenter for this year’s Peter Turner Memorial Lecture at the Wellington campus.</p>
<p>For more than 30 years Ruff has been analysing the visual expressiveness within various photographic genres, ranging from portraiture, landscape, nude and architectural photography.</p>
<p>This work has been carried out using his own analogue and digital photographs and computer-generated images, alongside images culled from scientific archives, print media and the internet.</p>
<p>In the 1980s he worked almost exclusively with an analogue camera. In the 1990s, as digital image technology became more readily available, he involved himself more with different fields of the digital visual world.</p>
<p>Professor of Fine Arts (photography), Anne Noble, says the point of departure for Ruff’s artistic work is “not the direct mirroring of reality, but rather it is the image-generating and manipulative character of the medium of photography&quot;.</p>
<p>The annual lecture honours the memory of the late Peter Turner, author, editor, publisher, curator and former teacher at the Wellington School of Design, which is now part of the College of Creative Arts. He championed photography as an art form and contributed to public knowledge and understanding of the medium through public lectures and exhibitions of contemporary Zealand photography.</p>
