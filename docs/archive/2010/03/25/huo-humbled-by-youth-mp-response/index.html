<p>**Huo humbled by Youth MP response<br>**</p>
<p>New Zealand’s political future is bright if the next generation of aspiring leaders is anything to go by, says Labour Associate Ethnic Affairs Spokesperson Raymond Huo.</p>
<p>Auckland-based Mr Huo said “I have been flooded with applications from young Kiwis to be my Youth MP. Applicants have come from as far away as Lower Hutt and across a range of different ethnic communities including Kiwis of Chinese, Indian, Korean, Pacific Island, Maori and Pakeha heritage,” said Raymond Huo.</p>
<p>Raymond Huo said he was impressed by the quality of applicants and their passion and knowledge of New Zealand politics.</p>
<p>“One applicant from Auckland Grammar School told me that Labour was a party of change, a party that fights for workers’ rights and equal opportunities for all,</p>
<p>“Another applicant from Macleans College also told me of her disappointment in the National Government for its proposed GST increases, its failure in Copenhagen and its concept of National Standards,</p>
<p>“As a migrant myself, I was touched by the number of applicants who were also from migrant families,</p>
<p>“I was very pleased to see they have all excelled in various areas, from school through to sport, arts or community projects. They have all contributed strongly to New Zealand society.”</p>
<p>The selection process coincides with the release of a UMR Research and Massey University report on the experience of immigrants in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The report states that many migrants from the Chinese community do not feel welcome and have struggled to integrate into New Zealand society:</p>

<p>“Some of the applicants who come from migrant families are guiding lights as to how to assimilate, succeed and become part of the fabric of New Zealand society,</p>
<p>“I was particularly inspired by one applicant from Pakuranga College who arrived in New Zealand in 2002 not being able to speak a word of English. She is now a top-student and has won awards for debating as well as being a senior leader at her school’</p>
<p>“This is the kind example other migrants need to follow to become true New Zealanders,” said Raymond Huo.</p>
<p>Youth Parliament is held every Parliamentary term and gives young New Zealanders the opportunity to experience life in the shoes of an MP. Youth Parliament will be held from 6-7 July this year.</p>
<p>The second round of Shortlisted Applicants for Raymond Huo’s Youth MP position:</p>
<p><strong>Nilu Kulasingham</strong> – Auckland Grammar School<br><strong>Meaghen Li</strong> – Macleans College<br><strong>Alan Dong</strong> – Auckland Grammar School<br><strong>Phoebe Jin</strong> – Epsom Girls Grammar School<br><strong>Philip Zhang</strong> – Auckland International College<br><strong>Alice Markie</strong> – Birkenhead College<br><strong>Vanessa Bowden</strong> – Sacred Heart College Lower Hutt<br><strong>Donna Chan</strong> – Glenfield College<br><strong>Ceecee Zhang</strong> – Pakuranga College<br><strong>Simone Te Hore</strong> – Edgewater College</p>
