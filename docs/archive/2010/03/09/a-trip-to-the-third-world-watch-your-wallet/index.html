<p>**“A Trip to the Third World – Watch Your Wallet”**Rt Honourable Winston Peters<br>Public Meeting<br>RSA Greymouth Branch</p>
<p>Thank you for your warm welcome.</p>
<p>It&#39;s good to be back on the Coast – among Coasters.</p>
<p>Today let us to start by asking a question – how do you describe a country in the following situation:</p>
<p>Most of its banks are owned somewhere else – just like New Zealand. No other developed country has such a high proportion of its financial system in foreign ownership.</p>
<p>The country has lost control of its strategic and prime assets. A great proportion of the productive economy is owned by foreigners.</p>
<p>There are few restrictions on foreigners gaining key assets -like energy and communications – just like New Zealand.</p>
<p>The main cities are full of immigrant taxi drivers – a form of disguised unemployment - like New Zealand. Wellington alone has 1700 cab drivers</p>
<p>The country has a chronic balance of payments problem –like New Zealand.</p>
<p>The telecommunications system is prone to breakdown and failure – even the emergency numbers - like New Zealand.</p>
<p>Regulation of the financial sector is a sick joke. Thousands can be robbed of their hard won savings by rascals who avoid being called to account – just like New Zealand.</p>
<p>The young, the educated, the talented and the enterprising see opportunities elsewhere – not in their own country – like New Zealand.</p>
<p>Nothing is sacrosanct – even the conservation estate can be plundered (often by foreign owned mining companies) – just like New Zealand.</p>
<p>Advertisement - scroll to continue reading</p>
<p>It loses its commuter train services around the capital, leaving passengers to walk along railway lines – and once again just like New Zealand.</p>
<p>Makes political decisions about changing the electoral system behind closed doors – just like New Zealand.</p>
<p>Increases taxes on the poor and the elderly to give to the wealthy.</p>
<p>This is how you describe that country – and it hurts me to say this – you describe it as descending into the Third World.</p>
<p>That&#39;s right.</p>
<p>This country - once described by that famous West Coaster Richard John Seddon – as “God&#39;s Own” is in a spot of trouble and nobody appears to be doing anything constructive about it.</p>
<p>If we look at the issues just outlined there is a common thread.</p>
<p>They could have all been eased or avoided if we had been prepared to make the right decisions at the right time and had owned our prime strategic assets.</p>
<p>No country has ever prospered when its resources have been controlled and exploited from abroad.</p>
<p>In the past few decades there never seems to have been a coherent plan to advance New Zealand&#39;s interests.</p>
<p>Successive governments have placed their faith in something called “the market” and that is supposed to have been the path to freedom and prosperity.</p>
<p>All we can say to that in 2010 is, yeah right!</p>
<p>The world has just been shaken by the biggest financial upheaval since the Great Depression of the 1930s and there are no prizes for working out who caused it.</p>
<p>You are right – it was the people who make up this thing called “the market”.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of ordinary people around the world have lost their jobs, their homes and their savings because of the actions of “the market”.</p>
<p>Now tell me – who controls all this?</p>
<p>Who has gained?</p>
<p>Who has been called to account?</p>
<p>What&#39;s happened to all the billions of dollars?</p>
<p>There are young men sent to prison in this country for robbing dairies of cigarettes and the contents of a shop&#39;s till.</p>
<p>Fair enough – commit a crime and do the time.</p>
<p>But what about the financiers and businesspeople who rob old people of their life savings?</p>
<p>They are still walking the streets, living their lavish lifestyles with family trusts that keep the wolf from the door.</p>
<p>They will not be worrying about electricity bills, doctors&#39; bills or the price of food.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the government&#39;s planned tax changes.</p>
<p>These tax changes promise some kind of economic miracle.</p>
<p>It has never happened in the history of the world before - everybody is going to pay less tax, the same amount of tax will be collected, and we are all going to be better off!</p>
<p>Especially pensioners and the low incomed who are going to be thrown some crumbs from the Treasury table.</p>
<p>Let us talk about the facts of the matter.</p>
<p>First – it is not possible for everybody to be better off, and this is why not.</p>
<p>The total tax take is going to remain about the same as it is now.</p>
<p>This has been stated publicly several times by leading members of this government – the boys who make the decisions.</p>
<p>That means for John, on his ministerial salary alone, to get his expected tax cut of three hundred dollars a week, somebody has to pay for it, through higher personal tax or extra GST.</p>
<p>Twenty lower paid people are going to have to pay fifteen dollars more tax a week each to finance the Prime Minister&#39;s tax cut.</p>
<p>Here it is again – so you don’t miss it - the tax according to John Key changes will be &quot;neutral&quot;.</p>
<p>That means the same amount of tax has to be gathered.</p>
<p>If people at the top of the heap get a tax cut, it means those at the bottom will pay more tax - even if it is simply through higher GST.</p>
<p>Pensioners are going to be hardest hit – and the government&#39;s own officials are aware of this.</p>
<p>That is why the Prime Minister has said there will be a two percent rise in superannuation.</p>
<p>But pensioners are already playing catch up because superannuation is always calculated on the PAST average weekly wage.</p>
<p>For example, from a reasonable commentary in the New Zealand Herald this week – it said ...and I quote:</p>
<p>”superannuation payments will rise slightly faster, by 2.31 per cent, because of the National Party&#39;s election promise to maintain the married rate at a floor of 66 per cent of the net average wage.</p>
<p>But the net average wage actually rose by 4.16 per cent, so all beneficiaries and superannuitants slipped slightly further behind those still in the workforce.”</p>
<p>We calculate that the forthcoming tax changes and the time lag for adjusting pensions will cost the average pensioner the equivalent of a day&#39;s food a week – about seven or eight dollars.</p>
<p>It also means that superannuation is actually falling below 66 percent of the net average wage.</p>
<p>People on superannuation, in the main, spend differently to most other people in the community.</p>
<p>They live on their pension and their savings (and don’t forget the withholding tax has gone up on the interest on their savings).</p>
<p>Also there will be a transition period when GST is increased.</p>
<p>Don’t tell us that some businesses wont use the chance to make a bit extra, thus throwing a further burden on those on low fixed incomes.</p>
<p>You might not be aware of this but Treasury officials generally refer to superannuitants as the “unproductive sector”.</p>
<p>In most parts of the world, age is venerated because of the wisdom of experience and<br>the value of the life contribution.</p>
<p>Here, in NZ the elderly make up the “unproductive sector”.</p>
<p>It makes you wonder if all these clever people at Treasury have parents or grandparents or whether they were spawned by a process of osmosis!</p>
<p>And to add injury to insult, a study is being carried out as we speak on cutting the transport concessions of the SuperGold card.</p>
<p>The Transport Minister Stephen Joyce has ordered this work to be carried out.</p>
<p>This study of course has never been announced publicly by the government.</p>
<p>John Key forgot to mention it in his recent speech to Grey Power in Auckland – or perhaps he was not aware of it.</p>
<p>This whole tax change business appears to be a giant “con” job because all the people engineering it – from the back rooms at Treasury to the board rooms in Auckland – are those who will benefit from it.</p>
<p>We are in some sort of strange parody of Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham – except the poor are going to be robbed to pay the rich.</p>
<p>And speaking of parodies - let us now refer to one of New Zealand&#39;s favourite companies – Telecom.</p>
<p>This company has systematically looted New Zealanders&#39; pockets ever since it was privatised by the Labour government in 1990.</p>
<p>Telecom spent a lot of money advertising its new XT mobile phone network.</p>
<p>Remember that advertising?</p>
<p>You could ring up anywhere in the world if you were parked on top of a shipping container somewhere in the ocean. It was pretty fancy hi-tech stuff.</p>
<p>Trouble is most of us live on dry land in New Zealand and prefer to stay off shipping containers afloat in the ocean!</p>
<p>On land, the new network keeps breaking down.</p>
<p>To be fair to Telecom though – their mobile network works most of the time – as long as it&#39;s not an emergency call to one, one, one.</p>
<p>Telecom&#39;s Scottish boss got a three million dollar bonus for presiding over this debacle.</p>
<p>Perhaps he could be placed on one of these shipping containers and sent back to the UK.</p>
<p>We&#39;d make sure he had an XT mobile phone to deal with emergencies.</p>
<p>And remember the railways?</p>
<p>As Wellington commuters wander along the railway tracks when their trains break down they should spare a thought for the last National government and another iconic New Zealand company called Fay Richwhite.</p>
<p>Between them they managed to distribute hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer assets to themselves and their mates.</p>
<p>And what about the people using electricity in Wellington. Their distribution system is owned in China!</p>
<p>The problems outlined today could, and can be avoided by sound stewardship in New Zealand&#39;s best interests.</p>
<p>And by owning our own strategic assets.</p>
<p>The international financial disaster has shown that globalisation is an expensive mistake.</p>
<p>We are simply too small and vulnerable to throw open our doors for the wolves to come in and plunder.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we have a crop of highly paid politicians and bureaucrats who are interested in economic theories that should be kept in the textbooks on library shelves – not in the real world.</p>
<p>Last century New Zealand went through two world wars and a depression and we appear to have forgotten about past generations&#39; struggle for peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Our country is getting bogged down in arguments between economic theorists, capitalists and socialists instead of simply confronting the issues staring us in the face.</p>
<p>We are even heading towards a fight with the separatists who are trying to drag us back to some pre-European utopia where Maori created some kind of dusky paradise.</p>
<p>You&#39;d think that in a country of only four million people we would try to pull generally in the same direction.</p>
<p>But no, the various factions head off in a direction of self interest that will make us all poorer.</p>
<p>Only one political party has ever tried to act in the interests of all – and that is New Zealand First.</p>
<p>We are on our way back – we want to work with and for you next year.</p>
<p>Until then – good luck!</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
