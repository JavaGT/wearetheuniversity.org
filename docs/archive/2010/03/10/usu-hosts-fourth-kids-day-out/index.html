<p><strong>Wednesday, 10 March 2010, 2:30 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/USU._Student_Association_at_Unitec">USU. Student Association at Unitec</a></strong></p>
<p>USU Students&#39; Association host fourth Kids&#39; Day Out</p>
<p>March 10, 2009</p>
<p>They&#39;re said to have more energy than Huntly Power Station.</p>
<p>And on Saturday, March 27 The Funky Monkeys, New Zealand&#39;s own musical supergroup for kids, will bring that energy to Kids&#39; Day Out.</p>
<p>The family fun day is hosted by USU Students&#39; Association at Unitec and will start at 11am.</p>
<p>The Funky Monkeys - New Zealand&#39;s super group for kids will be there performing their hit song and dance routines.</p>
<p>Old MacDonald&#39;s farm lets children get up close to a range of animals like sheep, rabbits, goats and ponies.</p>
<p>There will also be face painters, balloon sculptors, story tellers, and bouncy castles.</p>
<p>Around a quarter of Unitec students have dependents, which is why USU Students&#39; Association at Unitec decided to establish the event two years ago.</p>
<p>USU Students&#39; Association at Unitec president, Pete Hodkinson says it&#39;s important that the students&#39; association caters to all age groups of students at Unitec:</p>
<p>&quot;Not all of our students are necessarily young and keen for a pub crawl. Kids&#39; Day Out gives our students, with kids, the opportunity to have a fun, social day out with their peers and families. Plus, it&#39;s not just for the kids- it&#39;s a fun, chilled out day. I went along last year, and I&#39;ve got to say, it was pretty entertaining,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Kids&#39; Day Out will be held at the Henderson Primary School fields, corner of Great North Road and Edsel Street, just a two minute walk from Unitec&#39;s Waitakere Campus.</p>
<p>Entry is free.</p>
