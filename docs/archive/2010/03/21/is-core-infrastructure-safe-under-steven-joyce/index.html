<p><strong>Sunday, 21 March 2010, 10:54 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Is Core Infrastructure Safe Under Steven Joyce?</strong><br>Communications and IT Minister Steven Joyce has revealed his disregard for New Zealand’s telecommunications infrastructure, Labour’s Communications and IT spokesperson Clare Curran said today.</p>
<p>On TV3’s ‘The Nation’ Steven Joyce said he is disinterested in Telecom’s fate, despite the XT network failures, questions over its ability to roll out the Government’s broadband network and its falling share price.</p>
<p>Mr Joyce said it was not for the Government to be worrying unduly about the impact of its decisions on any one company.</p>
<p>“Telecom is not just any private company. It maintains and operates New Zealand’s fixed line network, and has the largest infrastructure network of any of our telcos,” Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>“Telecom has obligations to Kiwis under the Telecommunications Service Obligations to provide free local landline calls, the 111 service and the ability to connect to the internet.</p>
<p>“While the Government will no doubt continue to ensure those obligations are met, Steven Joyce has revealed he has no regard for the future of the company which provides them.</p>
<p>“Telecom’s size and dominance in the market means it has a huge influence in the communications sector, so what role will it play in the future?</p>
<p>“Will Telecom, with its existing infrastructure, have a part to play in the taxpayer funded ultra fast broadband network rollout? Will electricity line companies be the preferred option?</p>

<p>“What would that mean for Telecom? The Government’s determination on who will be trusted with the broadband rollout will be major decision for Telecom.</p>
<p>“Telecom may not be flavour of the month with many Kiwis, but Steven Joyce needs to remind himself of how many New Zealanders rely on the services it provides.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce needs to be mindful of Telecom’s future. Because if it crumbles, it will leave thousands of Kiwis disconnected.”</p>
