<p><strong>Shipley as ECAN Commissioner not acceptable</strong>  </p>
<p>It appears the Government is setting up a cronies network to get its way on the management of Canterbury’s water, Labour’s water spokesman Brendon Burns said today.</p>
<p>“Environment Minister Nick Smith may say reports that former National Prime Minister Jenny Shipley is being considered as a Commissioner for Environment Canterbury are ‘premature speculation’, but this smacks of him lining up National mates to implement a pre-determined Government agenda.</p>
<p>“The future management of Canterbury water is too precious to be handed over to a succession of former National Government Ministers.</p>
<p>“ECAN was reviewed by Mrs Shipley’s former Deputy Prime Minister, Wyatt Creech, who began a dairy company convicted of repeated breaches of the RMA.</p>
<p>“Now, Jenny Shipley appears to be front-runner to take control of managing Canterbury’s water resource. This looks like a National Party jack-up.</p>
<p>“Already the Prime Minister is saying he wants a quick resolution in Canterbury so more water can be allocated.</p>
<p>“That ignores that we’ve already lost our right to swim safely in Canterbury streams due to agricultural intensification, mostly around growth in dairying.</p>
<p>“The last thing we want is someone with close National Party links who can rapidly implement the Government’s agenda and only pay lip-service to the hugely important, complex needs of improving water quality.”</p>
<p>Brendon Burns said Jenny Shipley was the ideological soul-mate of former National MPs Ruth Richardson and Don Brash, both of whom sit on the boards of dairy companies in Canterbury.</p>
<p>“ECAN was by no means perfect on water management but it was beginning to try and slow the gold-rush for water and improve water quality.</p>
<p>“The Government should be looking at giving ECAN expertise and resource, while upholding the principle of no taxation without representation.</p>
<p>“Nick Smith should think twice before he appoints Jenny Shipley or someone similar at Canterbury ratepayers’ expense to run a Government rapid growth agenda is unacceptable every level.”</p>
