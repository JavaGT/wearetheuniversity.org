<p><strong>Education System Failing Least Well Off</strong></p>
<p>The report released today by the New Zealand Institute highlights the failure of our education system to adequately cater for those at the bottom end of education achievement, ACT Education Spokesman Sir Roger Douglas said today.</p>
<p>&quot;It is remarkable that we have an education system that is relatively successful at delivering for most students, but an abject failure at helping those who most need it,&quot; Sir Roger said.</p>
<p>&quot;What a waste of human potential to allow so many of our young people to go uneducated. They will leave a failing education system without a high level of skills, and then will be priced out of the labour market where they are expected to compete with more skilled and older workers.</p>
<p>&quot;The only way to reverse this trend is to make each and every student matter – to force schools to compete for customers. Private enterprise does not discriminate against those from low-income backgrounds or with learning difficulties. In fact, schools which could attract such people by providing a quality education would end up succeeding in the marketplace.</p>
<p>&quot;That is why ACT has developed ‘Free To Learn&#39; - a comprehensive policy covering all areas of primary and secondary education that will increase parental choice and school autonomy.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not from the benevolence of the teacher that we should expect quality education, but from their regard to their own self-interest. The current system provides little reward to quality schools and quality teachers. That needs to change if we are to give all young people an opportunity to get ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;If National is truly committed to improving our children&#39;s welfare - this is a policy they should strongly consider,&quot; Sir Roger said.</p>
