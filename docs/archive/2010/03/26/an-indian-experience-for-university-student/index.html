<p><strong>An Indian experience for University student</strong>  </p>
<p>University of Waikato student Amrita Sahay is set for an experience of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Amrita, 22, has been selected to take part in the Know India Programme, a three week internship for diaspora youth, run by the Indian Government. The programme, which sees 38 participants from all over the world travel to India, aims to promote awareness of India among youth of Indian descent.</p>
<p>Amrita, a Waikato University Sir Edmund Hillary Scholar who has just completed her studies, leaves for India on Saturday (SUBS MAR 27). She’s excited, but admits to being more than a little nervous about being the only New Zealander picked for the trip.</p>
<p>“It’s my first time travelling by myself and I haven’t taken part in something like this before so it’ll definitely be an eye opener,” says the former Hamilton Girls’ High School student. “But it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity not to be wasted.”</p>
<p>She credits the Hillary Programme for giving her the confidence to make the most out of every opportunity. “The Hillary Programme teaches students the skills necessary to face challenges with confidence,” says Amrita. “In a way I’ll be applying those skills to my trip as I won’t be afraid to get out there and participate in things.”</p>
<p>Her trip includes visits to historical places, tertiary institutions, government organisations and industry, an introduction to the Indian media and film industry, and a possible meeting with Indian President Pratibha Patil and other dignitaries.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Fiji until the age of nine, Amrita says the trip is a chance to learn more about her culture and religion.</p>
<p>Amrita also hopes India will get her creative juices flowing as she has recently completed a Bachelor of Computer Graphic Design with honours degree at Waikato University. “I’ve been told India has really good street art and it also has different forms of art and graphics that are not seen in New Zealand,” says Amrita. “I hope to apply what I see and experience to my work in some way.”</p>
<p>Amrita intends to pursue a career in graphic design when she returns. Last year, she won a Waikato University Blues award for her achievements in graphic design, which included winning the Parafed Waikato Logo Design Competition.</p>
