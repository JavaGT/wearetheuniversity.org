<p><strong>Monday, 29 March 2010, 5:33 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>First Small Steps In The Right Direction</p>
<p>Labour’s Research, Science and Technology spokesperson David Shearer today welcomed the first incremental steps the Government has taken to put innovation at the forefront of our economic growth.</p>
<p>“Giving the Crown Research Institutes a clear directive to strive for breakthroughs to benefit New Zealand will be a key part of our economic transformation,” David Shearer said today.</p>
<p>“While the CRI Taskforce recommended changing the accountability, funding and governance structures in the sector, it will be their increased collaboration with universities and businesses to make innovations commercially viable that will create jobs and get more money heading to our shores.</p>
<p>“But there is much more the National Government should be doing.</p>
<p>“This is not the ‘huge change’ that the Government suggests, but positive first steps for science to be a major economic driver.”</p>
<p>David Shearer said the Government must follow through and make a commitment to R&amp;D in this year’s Budget.</p>
<p>“The taskforce said New Zealand had a ‘rare opportunity for change’,” David Shearer said.</p>
<p>“The challenge now for John Key and Research Science and Technology Minister Wayne Mapp is to continue to take positive action.</p>
<p>“May’s Budget must see National making a serious commitment to innovation,” David Shearer said.</p>
