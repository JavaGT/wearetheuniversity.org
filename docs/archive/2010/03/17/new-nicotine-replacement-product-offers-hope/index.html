<p><strong>New nicotine replacement products offer hope to smokers</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand smokers have given the thumbs up to two nicotine replacement products which may become more commonly available in this country following research from the University of Otago, Wellington . The new products come in small sachets which smokers keep in their mouth, allowing nicotine to be rapidly released.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the researchers are launching a second more ambitious study which will be the largest nicotine replacement trial ever seen in New Zealand. It is aiming to test an innovative new mouth spray to be used every time a smoker has the desire to light up.</p>
<p>The new study is looking for 1,600 participants in Wellington and Christchurch to take part in a trial to test the effectiveness of the new Zonnic mouth spray, to be used in addition to the normally available nicotine patches. Participants will also be given regular counselling to help them quit smoking.</p>
<p>&quot;The new Zonnic nicotine mouth spray study is a great chance to not only stop smoking altogether, but also to help other smokers who&#39;re desperate to kick the habit and haven&#39;t succeeded by going cold turkey or using nicotine patches on their own,&quot; says University of Otago, Wellington researcher, Dr Brent Caldwell.</p>
<p>The first NRT study results, which focussed on small nicotine sachets as a new form of replacement therapy, found that most smokers preferred the new products, snus and Zonnic, compared to the nicotine gum which is currently available from pharmacies and doctors.</p>
