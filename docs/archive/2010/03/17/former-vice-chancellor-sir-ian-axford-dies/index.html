<p><strong>Wednesday, 17 March 2010, 1:10 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sir Ian Axford (1933-2010) – former Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University</strong></p>
<p>It is with great sadness that Victoria University learnt of the death of Sir Ian Axford FRS, Hon FRSNZ, a former Vice-Chancellor and an honorary graduate of Victoria University, and one of New Zealand’s most distinguished scientists with an international reputation in astrophysics and space science.</p>
<p>“Sir Ian was Vice-Chancellor from 1982 to 1985,” says Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh. “He will be greatly missed by many within the University and the wider scientific community in New Zealand and overseas.</p>
<p>“In his time at Victoria University Sir Ian brought an energetic approach to a number of areas, including most visibly, the physical appearance of the Kelburn campus. He was particularly passionate about the Hunter Building, and played a leading role in the planning and building of the University Marae – Te Herenga Waka.</p>
<p>“Sir Ian led the creation of the Research School of Earth Sciences and encouraged the development of the Institute of Policy Studies and the Stout Research Centre. He was a strong supporter of the arts, particularly music.”</p>
<p>His scientific achievements have been recognised with the Space Science Award by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (1970), the John Adam Fleming Medal by the American Geophysical Union (1972), the Tsiolkovsky Medal by the Kosmonautical Federation of the USSR (1987) the Chapman Medal by the Royal Astronomical Society (1994), the New Zealand Science and Technology Gold Medal (1994), and New Zealand’s top science honour, the Rutherford Medal (1994).</p>
<p>“On behalf of the University staff, students and alumni, I offer my condolences to the family and friends of Sir Ian,” says Professor Walsh.</p>
