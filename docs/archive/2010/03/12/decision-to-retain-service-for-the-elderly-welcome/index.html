<p><strong>Decision to retain service for the elderly welcomed</strong></p>
<p>The Maori Party welcomes the Government&#39;s assurance today that it will not be cutting <a href="http://www.supergold.govt.nz/">SuperGold Card</a> public transport services.</p>
<p>“The SuperGold Card scheme is a valued and much needed service for people over 65,” Maori Party senior citizens spokesperson Tariana Turia said.</p>
<p>“I welcome Steven Joyce’s assurance that the ‘government is totally committed to the SuperGold Card, including the transport concession.’</p>
<p>“There are tens of thousands of elderly people who may not be able to drive, who are on low incomes and who need to get from A to B to get food, visit relatives in hospital and play a role in their communities. I know that the SuperGold Card was a great source of relief for these people, in helping to improve the quality of their life.”</p>
<p>Mrs Turia said she was fully supportive of the review if the focus is on ensuring the longevity of the SuperGold Card services.</p>
<p>“Our elderly people are a taonga and their wisdom and guidance is crucial in building strong and healthy communities. I have supported the SuperGold card in that it allows them freedom to contribute to their communities.&quot;</p>
