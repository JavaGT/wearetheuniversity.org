<p>Books are opened…but could opportunities close?</p>
<p>Tertiary students start classes this year amid growing concern at increasing threats to open access to universities.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see so many new students starting classes nationwide this week and last week. Ensuring as many students are able to succeed is integral to having a better-educated and highly-skilled society and economy,” says NZUSA co-president David Do.</p>
<p>“However, we are highly concerned that this will be the last cohort of students to enjoy fair and open access to university, if policies are changed to restrict access,” says Do.</p>
<p>Newspaper articles over the weekend have reported that Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce is considering making changes to open access policies regarding over-20s, entrance standards for younger students, and eligibility for student loans.</p>
<p>“We are concerned that moves to restrict entry for over-20s will limit access to those who missed their first opportunities for tertiary education. This would disproportionately affect Maori, Pasifika, and second chance learners,” says NZUSA co-President Pene Delaney.</p>
<p>Many Maori are second chance learners who benefit from the current access arrangements into tertiary education. For example, in 2008 over 66,000 Maori tertiary students were over the age of 20, while only 14,000 were under the age of 20.[1]</p>
<p>“Open access is a cornerstone of our tertiary education system. Any moves away from this will threaten participation by most of the population into tertiary education. This is the wrong message to send when we are trying to improve New Zealanders’ skills in the current difficult economic environment,” says Do.</p>

<p>NZUSA agrees with the Minister that we should better match people’s skills to the right education.</p>
<p>“That’s why we should be putting much more work into ensuring that prospective learners know all their possible pathways and choices.  This depends on the quality of careers advice that they get before embarking on further study or training. We also need to invest into helping institutions better support the students they have so that they are better able to achieve,” concludes Do.</p>
<p>NZUSA looks forward to engaging constructively with the Minister to also ensure that all students are properly supported (financially, academically, and otherwise) during their studies.</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.</p>
