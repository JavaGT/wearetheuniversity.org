<p><strong>Tuesday, 23 March 2010, 4:12 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Maungakiekie MP selects Youth MP</strong></p>
<p>Last week representatives of Onehunga High School, One Tree Hill College and Tamaki College battled it out to be the Youth MP for Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, MP for Maungakiekie.</p>
<p>The local high schools were asked to nominate one worthy candidate to give a five minute speech on “Why I should be the Youth MP for Maungakiekie&quot; and answer questions from a panel of judges.</p>
<p>“They all gave fantastic and well prepared speeches, and answered the questions thoughtfully. Each school can be proud of their chosen nominees”, Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
<p>“However there can only be one winner, I’m delighted to announce that Monisha Singh of Onehunga High School will take up my seat when Youth Parliament sits on the 6th and 7th of July 2010.</p>
<p>&quot; Monisha is an outstanding candidate. She is a school prefect who is eloquent, confident and ambitious. Her favourite subjects are geography and media studies and is a keen cricketer who plays in the 1st XI. She will bring many talents to her role as the Youth MP for Maungakiekie&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot; I am grateful to represent Maungakiekie and Peseta Sam in the Youth Parliament. It is going to be a wonderful experience. I will voice the views and opinions of the youth of Maungakiekie and do my best to represent them&quot;, Monisha Singh says.</p>
<p>Youth Parliament 2010 is an opportunity for young New Zealanders (16–18 years) to learn about New Zealand’s democracy and influence public decision-making.</p>
<p>“This gives the Youth MP’s a forum to be heard in the very chamber where this country’s politicians regularly debate the issues of the day”, Mr. Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
<p>“During Youth Parliament, Youth MPs have the opportunity to debate legislation, sit on select committees and ask parliamentary questions of Cabinet Ministers.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, their Youth Press Gallery colleagues report on their activities and make sure they are held accountable to the public.”</p>
<p>In May 2010, the Minister of Youth Affairs, Hon Paula Bennett, will announce the Youth Parliament 2010 Bill to be considered.</p>
