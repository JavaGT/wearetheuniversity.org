<p><strong>Massey scientist named Biotechnologist of the Year</strong></p>
<p>Dr Wayne Patrick, from the Institute of Natural Sciences at Albany, has been named the NZBio Young Biotechnologist of the Year.</p>
<p>Dr Patrick, 32, is a biochemist heading a team of six undergraduate science students in the development of an enzyme engineering process with the potential to transform DNA sequencing technologies.</p>
<p>NZBio is the national peak body representing bioscience industries. The award, supported by the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology, is presented to a scientist under the age of 40 whose work demonstrates the potential for future leadership in biotechnology.</p>
<p>Dr Patrick says he is thrilled at receiving the award as it reinforces the role and relevance of fundamental scientific research in advancing new technologies for medical, industrial and agricultural use.</p>
<p>The judging committee said he stood out as a candidate for the award because of his world-class research and development in the field of DNA ligase enzymes. He and his team have developed a more efficient synthetic version of the enzyme, which has become an indispensable tool in modern molecular biology research.</p>
<p>Dr Patrick joined Massey in October 2007 after four years of postdoctoral research at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, one of the world&#39;s leading research universities. He completed his PhD at Cambridge University and, prior to that, a Bachelor of Science (Honours) at Otago University.</p>
<p>He says the enzyme in its current commercially available form is expensive and unreliable and his &quot;obsession&quot; with improving its function could enable speedier development of molecular tools that break down harmful chemicals used in farming and horticulture, as one example.</p>

<p>&quot;The research in my lab group addresses fundamental questions about the evolution of enzyme structure and function, and we use that fundamental understanding to help us engineer bio-molecules with new or improved functions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This award is an acknowledgement that biotechnological innovation can come from fundamental research, and I am excited that we here in New Zealand recognise that fact. I hope that my own best work is still to come, but, thanks to my students, I am certain that the future of New Zealand biotechnology is bright.&quot;</p>
<p>Part of his prize includes participation in a New Zealand delegation to this year&#39;s Bio International Convention in Chicago in May.  </p>
