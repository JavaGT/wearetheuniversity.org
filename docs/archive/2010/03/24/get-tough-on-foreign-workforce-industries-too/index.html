<p><strong>Wednesday, 24 March 2010, 11:43 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party">The Maori Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Get tough on foreign workforce industries too</strong></p>
<p>Maori Party labour spokesperson Rahui Katene wants the Government to do more for New Zealanders looking for jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Government is going to get tough on people who are unemployed and other beneficiaries then it should also get tough on companies which are overlooking New Zealanders by hiring thousands of migrant workers,&quot; Mrs Katene said.</p>
<p>“This is about making sure our people get what appears to be thousands of jobs on our seas, in our forests, orchards and vineyards.</p>
<p>“New Zealand does not have a skill shortage in these jobs and I see no real effort being made by these industries and their contractors to put our people first.</p>
<p>&quot;Creating jobs is a great start but the reality is that there are already jobs out there that our people could do but they aren’t. If New Zealanders are not taking these jobs, we need to examine why,” Mrs Katene said.</p>
<p>“The Maori Party has a vision that we work together to make the nation great again by investing in ourselves to lead us to productivity on a grander scale.”</p>
