<p><strong>Wednesday, 24 March 2010, 9:42 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Night class cuts to be revisited at select committee</strong></p>
<p>Today at the Education and Science Select Committee, Maryan Street, Labour’s Spokesperson on Tertiary Education, will be speaking to the petition in her name and on behalf of 51,089 other signatories, seeking the reinstatement of last year’s funding cuts to night classes run through high schools.</p>
<p>“The government’s cut of $13million from the $16million Adult and Community Education budget is having its effects felt this year, so it is opportune that this petition should come before the select committee now, and before the 2010 Budget is finally decided,” said Maryan Street.</p>
<p>“Where there were 212 high schools offering a wide variety of night classes this time last year, there are now only 24. There used to be 220,000 people availing themselves of these low cost, accessible post-compulsory opportunities. Now there are whole parts of New Zealand which have lost this vital infrastructure,” she said.</p>
<p>“It is not too late for the government, especially under the new Minister for Tertiary Education, to revisit that budget cut,” she said.</p>
<p>The petition is set down on the select committee’s agenda for 10.50am – 12.10pm in Select Committee Room 3, Parliament House.</p>
