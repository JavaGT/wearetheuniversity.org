<p><strong>Study to test omega-3 effect on brain power</strong></p>
<p>A study to determine whether taking omega-3 supplements will improve adults&#39; brain performance is about to start.  </p>
<p>Researchers from the Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health and the School of Psychology at Albany campus are seeking 200 healthy men and women aged from 18-40 to participate in the study.</p>
<p>Project leader Associate Professor Welma Stonehouse, a nutrition researcher, says omega-3 fatty acids play essential roles in the structure and function of human brains. &quot;Our bodies can’t make these fatty acids very efficiently and therefore we need to consume them as part of our diet,&quot; Dr Stonehouse says. &quot;However, most New Zealanders consume low levels of these fatty acids, which could compromise their brain’s ability to perform at its peak.&quot;</p>
<p>Research to date has focused on the role of omega-3 in brain development and cognitive function in infants, children with learning disorders and older adults with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>&quot;Very little is known about its effects in healthy adults. This research is leading the way in this regard,&quot; says Dr Stonehouse, who is the author of several published studies on omega-3&#39;s nutritional benefits.</p>
<p>Others involved in the project are Dr Cath Conlon from the institute and psychologists Professor John Podd and Dr Stephen Hill.</p>
<p>Research participants will have to take a fish oil supplement or placebo for six months and will be required to visit the campus twice for a blood sample to be taken and to do an online cognitive test. They must be non-smokers and not be pregnant or breastfeeding and not already taking fish oil supplements or eating fatty fish more than twice a month.</p>
