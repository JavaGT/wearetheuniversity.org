<p><strong>Minister needs to take deep breath on special education review</strong>  </p>
<p>The rushed approach to the hearing of submissions on the Government&#39;s review of Special Education risks an outcome over which key stakeholders have little or no ownership, Grant Robertson Labour Special Education Spokesperson and Lynne Pillay Labour Disabilities Spokesperson said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Heather Roy confirmed to the Education and Science Select Committee this morning that only a small number of groups and individuals will get to give an oral submission on the review of Special Education. This is a very poor process. Many parents, students and schools feel passionately about the issues at stake here, and have a strong desire to have their voice heard, &quot;Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister herself has noted that over 1,500 written submissions have been received. This is an indication of the wide range of interested parties. While it’s admirable that the Minister herself wants to attend the oral submission hearings, she has appointed an advisory group, and she should make use of them more, to ensure those who wish to contribute have a chance to do so,&quot; Lynne Pillay said.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s select committee briefing confirmed that there are major issues up for decision in this process. The Minister made clear today that the governments ‘value for money’ drive in the public sector was ‘foremost in her mind’ in this review. That is disappointing especially given the funding cuts disabled children have already suffered such as specialised therapy and support for deaf students.</p>

<p>“What should be foremost in her mind is how to deliver on a quality education for all students. It is difficult to see how that can happen without some increased funding, &quot;Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister seems to want to rush through the consultation process, yet some very important human rights issues are on the table. With the Minister ruling out a funding increase, parents and schools are justifiably worried that resources will become tighter, and the government will begin prioritising assistance in a way that will compromise each child&#39;s legislated right to an education,&quot; Lynne Pillay said.</p>
<p>&quot;A rushed process such as this raises the question of whether the Minister has pre-determined outcomes for the review. She needs to take a deep breath and give all those who are interested the opportunity to be heard. That is the only way that a sustainable and durable outcome will be delivered that will provide the opportunity for all children to achieve their potential,&quot; Grant Robertson said.</p>
