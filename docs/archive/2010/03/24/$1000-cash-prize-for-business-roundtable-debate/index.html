<p><strong>$1000 cash prize for Business Roundtable debate</strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand Business Roundtable is tonight hosting the grand final of the Big Social Issues Debates. The debate will be held at the Academy Galleries in Wellington at 5.30pm and involve the top debaters from Victoria and Canterbury universities going head to head for a prize of $1000 over the moot We Should Look to the State for Moral Guidance. This will be followed by a panel discussion with Minister for Social Development and Employment Hon Paula Bennett and Executive Director of the Maxim Institute Greg Fleming.</p>
<p>The Big Social Issues Debates have been running since March 15 with six heats held in secondary schools in Wellington and Auckland. In the first semi-final in Wellington Victoria beat Otago affirming the moot Our Police Ought to Be Armed. In the second semi-final last night in Auckland, Canterbury beat Auckland opposing the moot Our Liquor Laws Are a Licence to Swill. The semi-finals were attended by an audience of young professionals and students.</p>
<p>Business Roundtable Chairman Rob McLeod said the debates have been a great way of promoting discussion on public policy issues among young people.</p>
<p>“The aim of the series has been to provide a stimulating forum for young people to get thinking and talking about some of the important social issues that face New Zealand, and we were delighted to be able to hold the first six debates in secondary schools.”</p>
<p>Mr McLeod said the membership of the Business Roundtable was highly supportive of the concept and noted that the Friedlander Foundation had contributed cash prizes and costs for the tournament.</p>
