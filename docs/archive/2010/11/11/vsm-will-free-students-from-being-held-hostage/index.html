<p><strong>VSM Will Free Students From Being Held Hostage</strong></p>
<p>The Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill passed its Second Reading in Parliament last night and we are now a step closer to ensuring that tertiary students throughout the country have the choice of belonging to a Students’ Association, or not ACT New Zealand Voluntary Student Membership (VSM) Spokesman Heather Roy said today.</p>
<p>“Last night ACT – with the welcome support of the National Party and United Future – struck an important blow in the battle to restore students’ freedom of association,” Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>“Students are the only sector of society compelled to join, and pay fees to, a union or organisation. In continuing to allow this, we breach the Bill of Rights Act 1990 – which protects the rights of individuals to determine who they associate with, which political ideas they associate with, and do so without compulsion or undue influence.</p>
<p>“Compulsory Student Membership (CSM) means students are held hostage – they cannot study unless they pay the unions fees. They’re forced to pay for services many don’t use – especially unfair on distance learners – have little say over how fees are spent, and are often misrepresented by association executives that promote the views of a small favoured minority. Even worse students have become victims of fraud and theft as association members or staff misappropriate funds.</p>
<p>“While I support students’ right to join a student association – and for that body to campaign, lobby, and charge a membership fee – I oppose the law that allows associations to hold students hostage.</p>
<p>“ACT is committed to according students the same rights as all other New Zealanders and allowing the freedom to associate or dissociate. VSM means freedom, freedom means choice, and choice is the most fundamental principle of a free and democratic society. My Bill will restore this freedom by the beginning of 2012,” Mrs Roy said.<br>ENDS  </p>
