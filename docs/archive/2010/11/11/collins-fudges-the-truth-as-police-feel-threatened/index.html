<p><strong>Thursday, 11 November 2010, 4:19 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>**Collins fudges the truth as police feel threatened<br>**<br>Police Minister Judith Collins cynically fudged the truth on at least four occasions when answering questions in Parliament today on frontline police numbers, says Labour Law and Order spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
<p>“It’s just as well that fudging the truth is not a crime, because otherwise stressed police staff, many of whom feel she is letting them down, might feel inclined to take the issue up with her,” Clayton Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“Her arrogance and lack of candour will win her no friends among police who now feel threatened on the frontline.</p>
<p>“When asked questions on how she reconciled her professed support for more police on the beat with the fact that eight out of 12 police districts will have less frontline police by the end of next year compared to the end of June 2009, she instead compared the projected 2011 figures with the end of 2008.</p>
<p>“Her answers distort the truth,” Clayton Cosgrove said. :”Of course, there were fewer frontline police at the end of 2008 than there were at the end of June 2009, because the final year of Labour’s funding for an extra 1000 frontline police was only half completed at the end of 2008.</p>
<p>“By the end of June 2009, however, the last of Labour’s 1000 extra frontline police were in place, and by the end of 2011 numbers will have gone backward from that point in eight of the districts.</p>
<p>“A Police Minister who fudges the truth in this way cannot expect to earn the respect of police who know what it’s like to be on the frontline.</p>

<p>“Judith Collins has a big reputation among cops all round the country for turning up for photo opportunities, but there’s a big difference between a photo op and what it’s really like,” Clayton Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“There is also a big difference between telling the truth and fudging the truth. And there is a vast gulf between Labour’s commitment to funding extra police, and National’s pretence that it is doing so.</p>
<p>“Under National almost all the extra police will go into Counties Manukau, the Minister’s home patch. Most of the rest of New Zealand will see fewer police.”</p>
