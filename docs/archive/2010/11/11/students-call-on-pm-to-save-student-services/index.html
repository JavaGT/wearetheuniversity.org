<p>Students call on PM to save student services</p>
<p>Students are requesting an urgent meeting with Prime Minister John Key to discuss how to save student services, representation, and welfare provisions from an Act Party Bill after it was voted through on its Second Reading in Parliament tonight.</p>
<p>“It is not too late for John Key to step in and save over a century of student representation and services from the Act Party,” says NZUSA co-President David Do.</p>
<p>“NZUSA, as the national representative body for tertiary students, is requesting he meet with us urgently to re-consider his Government’s support of the Act Party Bill. John Key met with Warner Brothers to save ‘The Hobbit’ - we are asking he do the same to save the important services and experiences students’ associations provide for university and polytechnic students in New Zealand,” says Do.</p>
<p>There is mounting concern from students, universities, and polytechnics over the extra new costs this Bill will impose, as well as the future loss of services, student life, and student voice. Students and the tertiary sector are worried that John Key and the Government do not fully understand the real practical implications of this Bill.</p>
<p>“National said it wanted to listen to students and the public when they supported the Bill going to Select Committee. New Zealanders have made it clear that they do not support this legislation - over 4800 submissions were received by the Select Committee on the Bill, and an overwhelming 98% were against,” says Delaney.</p>

<p>“Students are looking to John Key for his sensible leadership and pragmatism at this time. National has said it doesn’t want to destroy associations yet this is exactly what this Act Bill will do on many campuses,” says Delaney.</p>
<p>“We are not asking for a law change or any government funding - all we want is for the current law, which works well, to remain. John Key can do the right thing by looking at sensible pragmatic solutions on how to improve frontline services and representation for students, not cutting them away just for the Act Party’s ideology,” concludes Do. NZUSA has tonight written to John Key asking to meet with him urgently.</p>
