<p>Scientist wins prestigious Humboldt Prize</p>
<p>Scientist Professor Peter Schwerdtfeger, whose research has helped explain the physics and chemistry behind the colour of gold, has been awarded a prestigious Humboldt Research Award.</p>
<p>The award, also known as the Humboldt Prize, is given by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, in Bonn, Germany, to academics whose new theories, discoveries or insights have had a significant impact on their discipline and who expect to continue producing cutting-edge research in the future.</p>
<p>Professor Schwerdtfeger is Director of the Centre for Theoretical Chemistry and Physics at Massey University&#39;s Institute for Advanced Study in Albany.</p>
<p>He plans to continue his work in little researched areas &quot;beyond conventional quantum chemistry&quot;, including complex interactions that underpin real life scenarios such as the recent Pike River mine disaster caused by a methane gas explosion. &quot;The reaction of methane with oxygen is not well understood and molecular dynamics simulation would help to understand these complex chemical reactions,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>His work on the chemistry and physics of gold over the past 20 years has led to new understandings of what gives gold its unique yellow colour. &quot;The understanding of the chemistry of the elements changed substantially over the last three decades, as chemists slowly realised that Einstein&#39;s Theory of Relativity cannot be neglected anymore for heavy elements [like gold],&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Professor Schwerdtfeger believes New Zealand universities need more money for fundamental research if they are to attain the level of excellence needed for top international rankings. &quot;We have some really outstanding people here, but they struggle to get their research financed at adequate and internationally competitive levels.&quot;</p>

<p>The German-born scientist gained a degree as a chemicotechnical assistant at the Chemisches Institut in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1973, a chemical engineering degree from Aalen in 1976, and a PhD in 1986 from the University of Stuttgart. He has held a numerous positions as teaching and research fellow at universities in Germany, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>His Marsden-funded projects include experimental and theoretical investigations of the nanostructures of gold for a better understanding of the quantum size effects in nano-structured materials, and understanding and modelling the behaviour of dynamic clusters of atoms and molecules in heavy metal clusters. He has supervised a number of PhD students, and collaborates intensively with more than 30 research groups worldwide on many different topics, ranging from computational inorganic and organic chemistry to materials science and high-resolution spectroscopy. He has been the recipient of six Marsden grants totalling $4 million.</p>
<p>The Humboldt Research Award, named after the late Prussian naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt, is valued at 60,000 Euros.</p>
