<p><strong>Waikato University tikanga expert named to Māori language review panel</strong>  </p>
<p>The head of Aka Tikanga at the University of Waikato’s School of Māori and Pacific Development has been appointed to Te Paepae Motuhake, the independent panel reviewing the Māori language sector and strategy.</p>
<p>Te Kahautu Maxwell was named to the panel by the Minister of Māori Affairs, Pita Sharples, following the resignation of Pem Bird, who was recently elected President of the Māori Party.</p>
<p>A highly acclaimed orator and kapa haka composer and performer, Mr Maxwell is an expert in Te Reo Māori and tikanga.</p>
<p>He grew up on the East Coast, and is affiliated to Te Whakatōhea, Ngāi Tai, Te Whānau-a-Apanui, Ngāti Awa, Tūhoe, Ngāti Porou and Ngāti Maniapoto. He is a tohunga of Te Haahi Ringatū, and a licensed Māori language interpreter and translator.</p>
<p>“I am honoured to be recognised for my commitment to Te Reo Māori in joining this illustrious group of Te Reo Māori advocates on the Paepae Motuhake,” Dr Maxwell said. “My appointment acknowledges the University of Waikato as being instrumental in the revitalisation of Te Reo Māori over many years.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Mr Maxwell was named as one of 11 winners of the 2010 national teaching excellence awards, taking the inaugural Ako Aotearoa award for excellence in tertiary teaching in the Kaupapa Māori category.</p>
