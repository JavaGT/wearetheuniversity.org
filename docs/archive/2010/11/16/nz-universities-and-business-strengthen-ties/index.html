<p>New Zealand Universities continue to strengthen ties with the business sector</p>
<p>Christchurch, 16 November 2010 – Universities New Zealand (formerly known as the New Zealand Vice-Chancellor’s Committee) and the University Commercialisation Offices of New Zealand (UCONZ) today launched the fifth in a series of 14 nationwide Event Series in Christchurch, focussing on high-tech manufacturing.</p>
<p>The National Event Series is a joint project to create stronger university and business relationships, an initiative to connect New Zealand businesses with the latest discoveries from New Zealand’s leading researchers, facilitating increased innovation in New Zealand industry.</p>
<p>Due to the recent earthquake in Christchurch, the originally scheduled Event Series to be hosted by Canterbury University was postponed from 14 September to today. This Event Series will showcase exciting innovations in the high-tech manufacturing sector from seven of the nation’s leading-edge universities.</p>
<p>Nigel Johnson, the University of Canterbury’s representative on the project’s Steering Committee says “New Zealand continues to punch well above its weight in research and innovation; the ingenuity on show today is testimony to this. Our vision is to ensure this research makes its way into the hands of the appropriate people, where it has the opportunity to take its rightful place on the national and world stage. Forging meaningful relationships between our leading researchers and industries will help lay the pathway for further success.”</p>

<p>CRL Energy and Viclink will be showcasing their joint project, the creation of silicon nitride nanowires that are not only up to 100 times cheaper than current production methods to produce, but will also allow the creation of metal matrix composites that outperform existing metal matrix reinforcing materials (such as silicon carbide powders) on a price/performance basis. Further insight from Victoria University challenges the long-established photographic films used for X-ray imaging by creating a new and improved technique to address traditional limitations. Also on show is Nanogold and Nanosilver Wool Technology and Products, a new proprietary product suite of high value textiles with exciting implications for New Zealand wool fashion apparel, carpet and functional textiles.</p>
<p>Business New Zealand Chief Executive Phil O’Reilly says, “By developing our capabilities through research based solutions, New Zealand businesses will be better equipped to challenge for market dominance. It’s a win-win for all involved.”</p>
<p>Businesses interested in attending these events should contact their local university commercialisation office for more information, including the dates, locations and themes of future events.</p>
