<p>Adjunct professor role for eminent businessman</p>
<p>The University has appointed businessman Robin Hapi as an adjunct professor in the College of Business in recognition of his commercial skills and leadership qualities.</p>
<p>Mr Hapi (Ngäti Kahungunu Te Whatu i Apiti, and Ngäi Te Rangikoianake) will be available to provide advice and guidance to the executive education programme, the MBA programme, Te Au Rangahau (Massey’s Mäori Business Research Centre) and the college Pro Vice-Chancellor, Professor Lawrence Rose.</p>
<p>His appointment recognises his skills, knowledge and expertise in business, education, and Mäori development and is closely aligned to Massey’s teaching and research interests.</p>
<p>He has a Master of Business Administration with distinction and says he wants to give something back to Massey. “I am a Massey graduate and I’m keen to get involved and help other people wherever I can.”</p>
<p>He has already given a lecture on the Treaty of Waitangi Mäori fisheries settlement and supported a recent daylong governance session. Mr Hapi has a long career in management and in governance and is a member of the Institute of Directors and a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Management. He has for many years been involved in education as a Commissioner of the Tertiary Education Commission, a member of the governing body for Te Wänanga o Raukawa and as a former Trust Board Chair of Hato Paora College, which he attended. “Even though I am engaged in Mäori business, my passion is Mäori development and education.”</p>

<p>In 2002 he was a recipient of a 75th anniversary Massey Medal for outstanding achievement.</p>
<p>He has extensive experience in senior management and governance and is currently chairman of Aotearoa Fisheries Ltd, chairman of the Sealord Group, chairman of Business and Economic Research Ltd and is also a member of the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Board. He has previously been chief executive of Aotearoa Fisheries Ltd, and the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission (Te Ohu Kai Moana) chief executive.</p>
<p>Professor Rose says the college greatly values his experience and advice as well as his contribution to executive education. “He is a very well-respected former chief executive and experienced board member and he is among Massey’s most successful alumni.”</p>
<p>His appointment is part of a University policy to attract eminent commercial and industry experts with demonstrated leadership qualities and teaching supervision and research skills to honorary academic positions, while they maintain their business or other involvements.</p>
