<p><strong>Wednesday, 24 November 2010, 1:10 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZEI">NZEI</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Employment Law Changes Penalise Workers</strong></p>
<p>The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa says sweeping changes to employment laws will penalise already vulnerable education workers and are inherently unfair.</p>
<p>The legislation extends a 90 day work trial for all new employees, limits workers’ access to their union at their workplace, and allows employers to ask for proof of illness after just one day of sick leave.</p>
<p>For thousands of low paid school support staff who work irregular hours or are on fixed-term contracts, the legislation further threatens their job security.</p>
<p>“These workers already face a lot of anxiety and stress wondering if their contracts are going to be renewed each term or each school year. Now, each time they start a new fixed-term contract they face the prospect of a probationary period with no right to appeal,” says NZEI National Secretary Paul Goulter.</p>
<p>“Alternatively if they work on short fixed-term contracts, they could end up perpetually on probation.”</p>
<p>The legislation will also impact on teacher staffing as well as career development.</p>
<p>“The 90 day trial period will be a big stumbling block for those teachers or principals seeking to move in order to gain promotion. It could have a big effect on teacher recruitment particularly in early childhood centres and those hard to staff and remote schools.”</p>
<p>NZEI is also concerned that proposed changes to sick leave could affect public health.</p>
<p>“Having to get a medical certificate for one day’s leave will put pressure on parents who often need their sick leave to care for their children. They may end up sending sick children to school or early childhood centres, or turn up at work sick themselves because of difficulties around making a doctor’s appointment to get a certificate,” says Mr Goulter.</p>
<p>NZEI believes these legislative changes compromise the rights of all New Zealanders and it will continue to support the campaign against them.</p>
