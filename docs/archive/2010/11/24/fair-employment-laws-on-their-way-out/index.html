<p><strong>Associate Labour spokesperson</strong></p>

<p><strong>Media Statement</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fair employment laws on their way out</strong></p>
<p>Two new laws that attack the rights of kiwi workers have been passed by the National Government despite fierce opposition from tens of thousands of New Zealanders, says Darien Fenton.</p>
<p>The passing of the Employment Relations Bill (No 2) and Holidays Amendment Bill yesterday means that fair employment laws are on their way out, says Labour’s associate Labour spokesperson Darien Fenton.</p>
<p>“Both of these bills will impact on health and safety and the rights of workers to challenge the decisions of employers in unjustified dismissals. They will inevitably reduce protections for all workers.</p>
<p>“Labour strongly opposed both bills right through the process, along with thousands of submitters and 22,000 workers who marched, rallied and campaigned against them.</p>
<p>“Sadly, both bills passed their third reading with the support of National, Act and United Future.</p>
<p>“That means all workers will soon be facing the consequences of reduced rights,” Ms Fenton said.</p>
