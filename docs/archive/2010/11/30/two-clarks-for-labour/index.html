<p><strong>Keeping it in the family</strong></p>
<p><strong>For many the name Clark is synonymous with the Labour Party. And the name looks to have a promising future.</strong></p>
<p>Dr David Clark is the Labour Party’s candidate for the Dunedin North seat due to be vacated when sitting MP Pete Hodgson retires at the next election. In a rare double, younger brother Ben was today confirmed as the Party’s candidate for the North Shore electorate in Auckland.</p>
<p>The brothers have much in common. Both David and Ben studied in Dunedin. They are both married with young families. They both describe their values as traditional Labour.</p>
<p>But in politics they face quite different challenges.</p>
<p>David has the challenge of maintaining a strong Labour vote in Dunedin North. He faced stiff competition just to win the Labour ticket.</p>
<p>By contrast, brother Ben was the only Labour nominee for the North Shore electorate. Incumbent National MP Wayne Mapp holds a 14,000 vote majority and Ben light-heartedly describes his task as “an uphill battle”.</p>
<p>Brothers in politics are not unknown. Ben has been amused by recent comparisons to the Miliband brothers in Britain. “It’s a story of the younger brother beating his older brother David to the Labour Party leadership” he says.</p>
<p>Neither brother is yet in Parliament. Dunedin North might be a safe Labour seat, but David says he takes nothing for granted.</p>
<p>“Labour is strong in Dunedin because local people have strong community values. It is also true that we’ve had good MPs. I want to carry that tradition forward” David says.</p>

<p>Younger brother Ben will be hoping a bit of the magic associated with the Clark name rubs off at the next election. Maybe then he’ll get to air his Miliband one-liners in Parliament.</p>
