<p>Friday 26 November 2010<br>A team at Victoria University has been awarded the 2010 Prime Minister’s Science Prize, worth half a million dollars.</p>
<p>Research from the Magnetic Resonance Innovation Team has been used in medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and in climate change research in Antarctica, and the team is looking to apply its research in agriculture and industry.</p>
<p>The team, led by Professor Sir Paul Callaghan, consists of: Professor Callaghan; Dr Robin Dykstra, Senior Lecturer in the School of Engineering and Computer Science at Victoria; Dr Mark Hunter, Research Fellow in the School of Chemical and Physical Sciences at Victoria; Dr Andrew Coy, a physicist and Chief Executive Officer of technology company Magritek; and Dr Craig Eccles, a physicist and Chief Technology Officer at Magritek.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s Science Prize is awarded for a transformative science discovery or achievement which has had an impact in New Zealand or internationally. Of the $500,000 prize money, $400,000 is for furthering the team’s research.</p>
<p>Victoria Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says the University is delighted with the team’s success.</p>
<p>“The Magnetic Resonance Innovation team is conducting world-class research. Their field is one of Victoria’s key strengths and we’re very proud of their success.”</p>
<p>The prize was presented by the Prime Minister, Rt Hon John Key, on Friday 26 November, in Auckland.</p>
