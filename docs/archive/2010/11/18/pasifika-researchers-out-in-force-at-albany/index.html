<p><strong>Pasifika researchers out in force at Albany</strong></p>
<p>Thursday, November 18, 2010<br>Poverty reduction in Fiji, Samoan leadership style, and Pacific Island perspectives on western psychology were among the diverse research topics presented at a two-day conference at Albany last week.</p>
<p>About 50 staff and postgraduate students from all three campuses gathered for the fifth Pasifika Staff and Student Network conference, with the theme of <em>Pasifika Community Development: managing change for growth.</em></p>
<p>Participants from many Pacific backgrounds presented their latest research from a wide range of academic disciplines, covering economic, education, health and social issues.</p>
<p>Dr Lesieli MacIntyre, a senior lecturer at the College of Education&#39;s School of Educational Studies, Manawatu, spoke about her work on how early childhood education centres can better meet the educational needs of Pasifika children born in New Zealand. She said while some Pasifika children may lack specific European cultural, technological and linguistic knowledge, they have in depth knowledge of their own cultural traditions, values and identity which she says their learning should be based on and grow from.</p>
<p>Talei Smith, a master&#39;s student who is teaching at Tu Toa, a Kaupapa Maori secondary school in Palmerston North, presented her findings from a multidisciplinary study exploring a gap in educational research on how pupils from a range of cultural backgrounds manage their &quot;hybrid&quot; identity in a mono-cultural, mainstream framework.</p>

<p>Indigenous nursing practice in a Fijian context, the impact of <em>kava</em> consumption by teachers on educational achievement in Fiji, and critical success factors for Pasifika students at Massey were among the papers presented.</p>
<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Maori and Pasifika) Professor Sir Mason Durie, launched several new publications from the Pasifika@Massey Directorate.<br>These included a monograph by Analosa Ulugia-Veukisa from her public policy master&#39;s thesis on the influence of spirituality on the sexual behaviour of young Samoans in New Zealand, titled <em>What&#39;s God got to do with Sex?</em></p>
<p>Also launched were a collection of writings by Pasifika authors called <em>Talanoa Ripples: Across Borders, Cultures, Disciplines,</em> and reflections on Tonga&#39;s foreign relations written by the current Tongan Prime Minister, Dr Feleti Sevele.</p>
<p>Associate Professor of Economics Rukmani Gounder, who chaired the conference, spoke on socio-economic and community development for poverty reduction in Fiji. Conference organiser and Pasifka Director Professor Sitaleki Finau discussed an alternative approach to community development suited to Pasifika social structures.</p>
<p>Professor Finau says the conference was a resounding success, showcasing the broad scope and richness of scholarship by Pasifika academics across the University&#39;s colleges and campuses.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s clear each and every one of the conference participants has done a great deal to progress the University&#39;s [Pasifika] strategy to advance teaching, research and consultancy. Individually and collectively, their work promises to make big differences to our Pasifika communities and nations. The publications represent Pacific knowledge being packaged for academic and community use.&quot;</p>
