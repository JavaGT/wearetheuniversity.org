<p><strong>Thursday, November 18, 2010</strong><br><strong>Three amigo animators off to Kuala Lumpur</strong></p>
<p>Three Institute of Communication Design students, have been invited to participate in an international animation design challenge in Malaysia next month.</p>
<p>The trio, Yannick Gillain, Felix Telfer and Shinji Dawson, who call themselves the Three Amigos, were selected by international software firm Autodesk for the three-day game development challenge, which will take the form of a reality TV show.</p>
<p>Institute undergraduate programme leader Gray Hodgkinson says the Panorama 2010 Asia-Pacific Design Challenge at Kuala Lumpur has been billed as an exclusive premier training, networking event for animation design, engineering and architecture students which combines a learning environment with a mix of social activities.</p>
<p>“It’s a great coup to have three students from Massey representing New Zealand at animation there,” Mr Hodgkinson says.</p>
<p>The winning team will receive prize money of $US1200, a team trophy and Autodesk Maya software and certificates for each member.</p>
<p>All three Amigos have recently by employed by Wellington design company Source and have examples of their digital animation work on display as part of the Exposure exhibition at this year’s <em>BLOW</em> creative arts festival at the Wellington campus.</p>
<p>Their digital animation short film, <em>Circuit</em>, looks humorously at conflicting technologies and man&#39;s desire to constantly upgrade while neglecting the consequences of the technology left behind.</p>
