<p>15 November 2010<br><strong>Reduce overcrowding for better health</strong></p>
<p>High rates of rheumatic fever due to overcrowding can be brought down by providing the essentials for every New Zealander, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>Researchers at Otago University today released a study which finds rheumatic fever infection rates in areas with the most crowded households are nearly 90 per cent higher than areas with the least crowded households.</p>
<p>“This research shows the drastic need for more, high quality, state housing where it is most needed,” Green Party Health spokesperson Kevin Hague said.</p>
<p>“Rheumatic fever is a disease of overcrowding and poverty. The simple solution is to build more houses where they are needed and ensure housing is affordable.</p>
<p>“Public health interventions, such as throat swabs and monitoring, are good but are the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff.</p>
<p>“Earlier in the year I challenged the Minister of Health Tony Ryall about rheumatic fever. It seems this he has done nothing to make the situation better.</p>
<p>Mr Hague said that the Green Party&#39;s Mind the Gap package, launched earlier in the year, would be a good starting point for the Government to address overcrowding and other poverty related health issues.</p>
<p>“Access to affordable housing means families will be able to afford rents, take their children to the doctor, and heat their houses sufficiently during winter,” Mr Hague said.</p>
<p>“We have a major income inequality gap which puts these things out of the reach of a lot of New Zealand families.</p>

<p>“Introducing an In-Work Tax credit for all low-income families and a tax free $10,000 would free up some money to allow families to afford to go to the doctor, buy healthier food, and heat their houses adequately,” Mr Hague said.</p>
