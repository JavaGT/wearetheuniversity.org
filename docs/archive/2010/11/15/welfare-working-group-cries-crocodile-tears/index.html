<p>Welfare Working Group Cries Crocodile Tears for the Poor</p>
<p>Comments by Chairperson of the Welfare Working Group Paula Rebstock on &#39;Q and A&#39; this week expressed crocodile tears for beneficiaries trapped in poverty, said Green Party Work and Income spokesperson Catherine Delahunty today.</p>
<p>&quot;She acknowledges people want jobs, but before their work is even finished, the Welfare Working Group&#39;s real agenda is clear.</p>
<p>&quot;Paula Rebstock is helping to manufacture a sense of crisis and blame so that benefits can be cut and people sanctioned when they cannot find work in a recession.</p>
<p>&quot;Paula&#39;s comments that &#39;any job is a good job if done well&#39; ignores the state of the labour market and real issues for people with disabilities, who are solo parents or on the sickness benefit.</p>
<p>&quot;Roughly three quarters of people who rely on welfare support do so for less than a year, to get through challenging situations.</p>
<p>&quot;Her logic that being on a benefit makes you sick is a cheap shot. Sending sick and disabled people into jobs that are inappropriate for them will increase illness and stress,&quot; said Ms Delahunty.</p>
<p>&quot;Where is the leadership from the Welfare Working Group on job creation and educational opportunities for beneficiaries?&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Delahunty said the Government had cut the Training Incentive Allowance for sole parents and capped places in tertiary institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;As disability spokesperson I am particularly concerned about the rhetoric around jobs being great for people with disabilities, when jobs are scarce and these most vulnerable people are last on the list of many employers.</p>
<p>&quot;The focus should be on job creation for a living wage, raising the minimum wage and educational opportunities, not beneficiary bashing disguised as empowerment,&quot; said Ms Delahunty.</p>
<p>&quot;A fair society provides the essentials so that people have opportunities, especially in hard times.&quot;</p>
