<p>Hon John Carter<br><strong>Member of Parliament for Northland</strong></p>
<p><strong>8 November 2010</strong><br><strong>Media Statement</strong></p>
<p><strong>Northland MP won’t stand for re-election</strong><br>Northland Member of Parliament John Carter today announced he will not stand for re-election at the 2011 election.</p>
<p>“It is time for me to relinquish my position as MP in Northland,&quot; Mr Carter said. “After lengthy consideration, I have come to the conclusion that I will not seek re-election in 2011.</p>
<p>“This is my eighth term as MP for Northland, the region where I was born and bred. I believe I have represented Northland well for 23 years. The investment I have made in the region for all of my constituents over this time has been hugely enjoyable and rewarding. However, the time has arrived for me to move on in my life, thus giving an opportunity for new representation in Northland.</p>
<p>“I have had an incredible journey during my 23 years in Parliament, with many great experiences and an accumulation of achievements that I feel have steadily improved the lot of the people who have consistently put their faith in me to represent them.</p>
<p>“Being a Minister is the pinnacle of an MP’s career and I am enjoying the portfolios I have this term (Minister of Civil Defence, Minister for Racing, Minister for Senior Citizens and Associate Minister of Local Government).</p>
<p>“Civil Defence has certainly stood out and I hope I was able to give some assurance to the people of Canterbury in the early days after the 4 September earthquake.</p>

<p>“I have also enjoyed being part of the team that prepared the legislation to set up the super city of Auckland.</p>
<p>“Politics is about people and as politicians we have to spend a lot of time listening to what people want. I chaired the Auckland Governance Legislation Committee and believe we reflected the views of the different interest groups involved with the legislation for a unified Auckland city in the best possible way.</p>
<p>“I have also seen first hand, how responsive our Civil Defence Emergency Management Plan is in securing the safety of people. We are leaders in the world in this regard.</p>
<p>“As anyone who knows me will know, I will be working hard for the people of Northland and for those whose interests I represent with my portfolios until the day I leave Parliament Buildings towards the end of next year.”</p>
