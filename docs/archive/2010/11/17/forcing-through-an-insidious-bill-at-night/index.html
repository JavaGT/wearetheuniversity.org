<p><strong>Wednesday, 17 November 2010, 11:49 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>**‘Dead of night’ fitting time for Government to force through an insidious bill<br>**<br>Labour’s Auckland Issues spokesperson Phil Twyford says it is fitting that the Government is pushing the insidious Local Government 2002 Amendment Bill through under urgency in the dead of night.</p>
<p>“This Bill will allow local bodies to privatise water supply or contract out services in the dead of night, so it is no wonder that the Government doesn’t want debate on it to take place in the light of day,” Phil Twyford said.</p>
<p>“Labour and the Greens are committed, however, to working together to oppose this anti-democratic bill, and to shed as much light as possible on the dangers it represents.</p>
<p>“The bill takes away the right of people to be consulted before councils corporatise their services, or contract them out to the private sector.</p>
<p>“This is the latest in a line of local government bills from the National-led Government that takes away the democratic rights of New Zealanders,” Phil Twyford said.</p>
<p>“Firstly Aucklanders had the super city imposed on them and were never given a say. Then Environment Canterbury, the Canterbury regional council, was sacked. Now they are about to open up local water supply to private control and ownership for up to 35 years.</p>
<p>“The Government says this Bill will increase transparency and accountability,” Phil Twyford said.</p>
<p>“In fact, it does the opposite. The requirements to consult Kiwis are gutted.</p>
<p>“National is trying to pull the wool over the eyes of Kiwis. Forcing through this Bill in the dead of night makes that task so much easier.”</p>
