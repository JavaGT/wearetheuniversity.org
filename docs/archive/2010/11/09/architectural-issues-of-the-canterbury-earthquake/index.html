<p>Public Lecture: Architectural issues of the Canterbury earthquake</p>
<p>Although no lives were lost in the Canterbury earthquake, damage to buildings was extensive. Four of Victoria’s School of Architecture’s leading experts will discuss architectural issues from the Canterbury earthquake at a free public lecture at Victoria University on Tuesday 16 November.</p>
<p>Dr Geoff Thomas will talk about how damaged homes can be retro-fitted for safety in earthquakes, and show photographs from his recent trip to Christchurch, where he accompanied representatives of building association BRANZ to analyse structural damage of residential homes.</p>
<p>Teaching Fellow in Conservation David Kernohan will discuss whether post-quake retention of heritage architecture is feasible and who should pay for it.</p>
<p>Martin Bryant, Senior Lecturer – Landscape, will draw on his research into how to design public space better to provide places for people to congregate and shelter after a disaster.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Diane Brand, Head of the School of Architecture and a member of the Christchurch Urban Design Panel will consider the opportunities and risks in redeveloping sites in the Christchurch inner city.</p>
<p>The lecture ‘The Canterbury Earthquake—The Aftermath’ will be held on Tuesday 16 November from 6pm in Victoria University’s Pipitea Campus, Rutherford House, Lecture Theatre 2.</p>
