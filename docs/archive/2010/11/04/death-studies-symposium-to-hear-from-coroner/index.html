<p><strong>Death studies symposium to hear from Bay of Plenty coroner</strong>  </p>
<p>Topics ranging from a New Zealand study of near-death experiences to post-tsunami trauma and grief support in Samoa will feature at a symposium on death, dying, mourning and disposal practices in Aotearoa New Zealand to be held at the University of Waikato next week.</p>
<p>The one-day symposium on November 11 will bring together researchers and practitioners, including the Bay of Plenty Regional Coroner, to explore potential areas for interdisciplinary research, policy and practice in this field.</p>
<p>Hosting the symposium are Professor Ngahuia Te Awekotuku of the School of Maori &amp; Pacific Development, Associate Professor Linda Waimarie Nikora of the Maori &amp; Psychology Research Unit, and Associate Professor Cathy Colebourne of the Health and Social Research Centre.</p>
<p>“This symposium is one way to bring interested stakeholders together in the same space to survey and share issues, work in progress, research possibilities, interesting dilemmas and the expertise of those in this field of interest,” says Associate Professor Nikora.</p>
<p>Keynote speaker Dr Tracey McIntosh of the University of Auckland, who has a special interest in extreme death experience, will deliver an overview of the death studies field.</p>
<p>Rotorua-based Regional Coroner Dr Wallace Bain will then discuss cultural practices surrounding death and the New Coroners Act 2006. He will make specific reference to two recent case studies involving objections to post-mortems for religious and cultural reasons.</p>

<p>His address will be followed by presentations on topics including historical antecedents for fatal child abuse in New Zealand, hospice services for Chinese immigrants, changing trends in funerals and the ethics around deactivating a pacemaker in a pacemaker dependent patient.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato currently has more than 25 staff and graduate students from various disciplines engaged in research of relevance to the study of death. The largest endeavour is the Tangihanga Research Programme led by Professor Te Awekotuku, Associate Professor Nikora and Dr Tess Moeke-Maxwell.</p>
<p><em>Death Studies in Aotearoa New Zealand: A Symposium will be held at 9am-5pm on Thursday 11th November in Room S1.02 at the University of Waikato, Hamilton. Parking available at Gate 2. There is no registration fee. Tea and coffee, and a light lunch will be provided in exchange for koha to student fundraising activities.</em></p>
