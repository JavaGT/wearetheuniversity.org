<p><strong>Thursday, 4 November 2010, 3:03 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Snedden latest casualty of National Government games</p>
<p>It is becoming increasingly clear that Health Minister Tony Ryall’s arrogant leadership style is causing an exodus of experience in the health sector, with Pat Snedden of Auckland DHB the latest departure, Labour health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.</p>
<p>“Since Tony Ryall became the Minister of Health, Richard Thomson of Otago DHB was sacked as Chair, Ken Whelan resigned as CEO of Capital and Coast DHB after refusing to continue cutting health services, Stephen McKernan Director General of Health resigned and now Pat Snedden is also leaving,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>“This is a substantial loss of experienced health leaders in a very short space of time.</p>
<p>“Labour has been aware of grumblings for quite some time within the health sector over Tony Ryall’s arrogant behaviour.</p>
<p>“There is also the issue of Tony Ryall approving more than 100 cuts to frontline health services-- cuts such as $12 million from smoking cessation, $2 million from mental health services in Nelson, slashing home help for the elderly and cutting back diabetes programmes in South Auckland.</p>
<p>“The reality is Tony Ryall’s leadership in the health sector has been poor and New Zealand is losing experienced health professionals as a direct result,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
