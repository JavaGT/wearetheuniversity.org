<p><strong>WELCOMING SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON</strong></p>
<p>I enjoyed talking with United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Wellington yesterday. We agreed that the relationship between our two countries is in great shape. It is the best it has been for 25 years.</p>
<p>Secretary Clinton was welcomed to Parliament with a powhiri, and then Foreign Minister Murray McCully and I held talks with her. I also really enjoyed hosting her for a barbecue with a unique Kiwi flavour at Premier House.</p>
<p>At Parliament she <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-13680.link">signed the Wellington Declaration with Hon Murray McCully</a>. The Declaration establishes a new strategic partnership between our two countries. This will include regular ministerial meetings and working together more in the Pacific.</p>

<p><strong>LIFTING ACHIEVEMENT IN OUR SCHOOLS</strong></p>
<p>I want every young New Zealander to have the opportunities they need to succeed. National is not prepared to tolerate the shocking statistic that one in five children leave school without the reading, writing, and maths skills they need.</p>

<p>National Standards in education are a core part of our plan to secure a brighter future for New Zealanders. Before the 2008 election we promised to implement National Standards, and that is what we have done.</p>
<p>The Standards show what Year 1 to 8 children should be able to achieve in reading, writing, and maths, and by when. Schools report each child&#39;s progress to parents twice a year. The Standards will identify which children are falling behind so we can help them catch up.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve had lots of positive feedback on the Standards from parents, teachers, and principals. The vast majority of schools are implementing the Standards. As with any major new policy, we will make changes where needed.</p>

<p><strong>LAUNCHING THE DEFENCE WHITE PAPER</strong></p>
<p>On Tuesday I launched the <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-13683.link">Defence White Paper</a>. The White Paper is a comprehensive review of our defence force, and it delivers on one of National&#39;s pre-election promises. We want New Zealand to have a strong and effective defence force in the future. That&#39;s why we need to plan ahead and get the best value for money from the defence budget.</p>

<p><strong>KEEPING THE HOBBIT AT HOME</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for all your feedback on The Hobbit films. I am delighted that the National-led Government was able to strike a deal with Warner Brothers, and make sure that Sir Peter Jackson&#39;s two Hobbit films will be made in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Our film industry is worth about $2.8 billion to our economy. It provides thousands of jobs, supports local businesses, and showcases our country to the world. Despite this, unions threatened the industry, prompting Warner Brothers to seriously consider making the films elsewhere.</p>
<p>It is great news that we have reached an agreement and filming is set to begin here next year.</p>

<p><strong>ATTENDING THE EAST ASIA SUMMIT</strong></p>
<p>On Sunday I returned from a productive trip to the East Asia Summit in Hanoi, Viet Nam. It was good to be there with the 10 ASEAN leaders and new Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard, and talk about the key issues facing our region. I also visited Ho Chi Minh City to strengthen trade and commercial ties.</p>

<p><strong>FROM MY DIARY</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;m looking forward to going to the World Rowing Championships at Lake Karapiro this Sunday, and on Tuesday I&#39;m heading down to Christchurch for Cup Day. On Wednesday I&#39;m off to Yokohama in Japan for the APEC Summit.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p><strong>John Key<br>Prime Minister</strong></p>
