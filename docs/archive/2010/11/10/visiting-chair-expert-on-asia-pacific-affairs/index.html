<p>“This is an area of enduring and increasing strategic significance for New Zealand, and Muthiah’s wealth of knowledge on the Asia-Pacific region will add tremendous value to the issues we are examining,” says Professor Robert Ayson, Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies, where Dr Alagappa will be based from 16 November 2010 until January 2011.</p>
<p>During his visit, Dr Alagappa will deliver public lectures in Wellington and throughout the country, and will lead a range of research seminars at Victoria and other New Zealand universities.</p>
<p>On the evening of 7 December 2010, he will deliver the annual Kippenberger public lecture in Wellington. His topic will be A Changing Asia-Pacific: Prospects for war, peace and order.</p>
