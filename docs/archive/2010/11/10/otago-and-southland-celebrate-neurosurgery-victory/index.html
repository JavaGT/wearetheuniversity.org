<p>Clare Curran<br><strong>MP for Dunedin South</strong></p>
<p>Pete Hodgson<br><strong>MP Dunedin North</strong></p>
<p>10 November 2010 <strong>Media Statement</strong><br>Otago and Southland celebrate neurosurgery victory</p>
<p>Dunedin Labour MP’s Pete Hodgson and Clare Curran today congratulated southern communities whose refusal to give up neurosurgeons in the region has resulted in a decision to retain three specialists in Dunedin.</p>
<p>The South Island Neurosurgical Service expert panel has recommended a minimum of three neurosurgeons should be based in Dunedin, and that the South Island-wide service should comprise eight neurosurgeons once fully established.</p>
<p>“The rallying for the retention of Neurosurgery at Dunedin Hospital has gone from strength to strength. Otago and Southland today celebrate a victory, banding together over the past few months to show that the community is a strong united force. This announcement bodes well for the newly merged DHB,” Dunedin North MP Pete Hodgson said.</p>
<p>“Health Minister Tony Ryall has put the Otago and Southland communities through months of stress and anguish which could have been avoided. Today’s announcement is a direct result of their protests, petitions and the pressure they placed on the Government.”</p>
<p>“Tony Ryall should have intervened in the issue at the beginning. He should step up to the role or get out of it,” Clare Curran said.</p>
