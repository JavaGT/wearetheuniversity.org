<p><strong>Nancy Winter Early Childhood Centre, Raetihi</strong><br><strong>Hon Tariana Turia, MP for Te Tai Hauauru</strong><br><strong>Friday 12 November 2010; 10am</strong></p>
<p>I am delighted to return here to the Nancy Winter early childhood centre. I remember the opening on the 1st April 2007 as being a wonderful day – a day to share in the pride of this great community; to admire the transformation that had taken place at this centre; and an occasion to cherish our children and all those who make them who they are.</p>
<p>I expect nothing less of today.</p>
<p>Today is a time to congratulate and celebrate Viv Hoeta for her success in graduating with a Diploma in Early Childhood Teacher. If ever there was a time to dare; to make a difference; to embark on something worthwhile it is now.</p>
<p>And I want to just share a few thoughts about the remarkable journey that Viv has gone through, to get to today.</p>
<p>When the Nancy Winter centre was opened back in 2007 Viv was one of the first teachers appointed, and has been a valued and significant member of your teaching team.</p>
<p>Viv puts into practice that concept – to the world you may be just one person; but to one person you may be the world.</p>
<p>She has invested herself in each and every child that comes here; making them feel wonderful, and on top of the world. And isn’t that what we want for every child?</p>
<p>But the wonderful thing about Viv is that she takes that same attitude into each and every area of her rich and busy life.</p>
<p>She is a passionate and enthusiastic advocate of the Phoenix players.</p>

<p>She is the Chairperson of the Raetihi School Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>She has been a devoted supporter in the church; she has been a model parent in the investment she has given back to the community through her mahi with kohanga, kura kaupapa and Ruapehu College. And she was a much valued member of the Waimarino Child, Youth and Family Panel over the years.</p>
<p>And I want to mihi to Stella for the influence and inspiration that she and Darcy have clearly laid, in helping Viv to forge new pathways ahead.</p>
<p>One of the former First Ladies of the United States, Eleanor Roosevelt, once said, ‘the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams’.</p>
<p>It is a brilliant concept that I think Viv has demonstrated in her journey.</p>
<p>And I want to acknowledge it has not been without challenge. She started off working in the kindergarten in Ohakune and in Community Health; while undertaking study at Massey University and then Whitireia Polytechnic and eventually the last year at Open Polytechnic.</p>
<p>At the same time as she working, and taking on further education, she was fully involved in many aspects of the community; as well as being a fulltime wife, mother, daughter and whanau member.</p>
<p>Her dedication and her pursuit of her diploma has reflected the beauty of her dreams that have driven her onwards, and so today, I take this time to congratulate her, and to honour her for her hard work.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to just pay a special tribute to the effervescent Lynne Pope; the legacy of Nancy Winter; and the strength and solidarity of the team at this centre; who have provided such a fantastic opportunity for our whanau in Raetihi.</p>
<p>You are all living proof of the African proverb – it takes a village to raise a child. This little village of Raetihi is all the better for your commitment and the magic you weave at this centre. Thank you.</p>
<p>ends</p>
