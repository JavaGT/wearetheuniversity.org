<p><strong>Wednesday, 3 November 2010, 1:34 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Phil Goff<br>**Labour Leader<br>**</p>
<p>3 November 2010 <strong>Media Statement</strong>  </p>
<p>**Government must accept challenge laid down by tobacco report<br>**</p>
<p>The report of the Māori Affairs Select Committee that recommends making New Zealand smokefree by 2025 represents a huge challenge for the National Government, Labour Leader Phil Goff.</p>
<p>“Thousands of New Zealanders die of smoking related illnesses each year and this report recommends some fairly common-sense approaches to getting rid of tobacco,” Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>“Labour supports calls to rid shops of tobacco displays and to have cigarettes and tobacco placed in plain packaging.</p>
<p>“During our time in Government Labour introduced the Smokefree Environments legislation that rid workplaces and bars and clubs of smoking indoors.</p>
<p>“National refused to support legislation removing smoking from indoor areas like bars and restaurants. So my hope that they will support these recommendations is slim.</p>
<p>“Last year National with the support of Labour increased the excise tax on cigarettes taking in an extra $200 million in tax revenue. However, National failed to tell the public or indeed other parties that it was planning to cut $12 million from smoking cessation services in the budget.</p>
<p>“If you want people to stop smoking you have to have the services available to help them.</p>
<p>“Labour is calling on John Key to step up and support common sense recommendations that will result in a healthier population,” Phil Goff said.</p>
