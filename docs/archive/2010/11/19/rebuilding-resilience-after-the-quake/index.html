<p>Rebuilding resilience after the quake</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury&#39;s Community Education programme is offering an evening of free practical lectures to help Canterbury residents build personal resilience in the wake of September&#39;s earthquake. The lectures, on Thursday 25 November, will cover the psychological impact of the quake and its affect on personal relationships, children and older persons.</p>
<p>Among the lecturers will be clinical psychologist Fran Vertue who will address the psychological needs of children and provide practical suggestions for parents to manage their children&#39;s concerns; Tom Matthews, who has a background in solution-focused counselling, education and business leadership, who will explore a series of exercises designed to increase personal wellbeing and strengthen relationships; and Kathy Peri, Director of the Older Person&#39;s Health Speciality Service at Princess Margaret Hospital, who will discuss earthquake recovery for older persons.</p>
<p>The programme&#39;s Senior Coordinator, Natasha Guy, says the lectures, which will offer advice on dealing with these issues, have been designed for a general audience and will be presented in two 50-minute blocks.</p>
<p>She says the University is not accepting registrations for the lectures, which are being held in the central lecture theatre block at the Ilam campus, and advises people to arrive early.</p>
