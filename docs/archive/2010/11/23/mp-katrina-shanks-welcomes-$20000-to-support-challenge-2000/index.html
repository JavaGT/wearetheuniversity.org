<p><strong>MP Katrina Shanks welcomes $20,000 to support Challenge 2000</strong></p>
<p>Ohariu based National-list MP Katrina Shanks, welcomes the Government&#39;s announcement of $20,000 to support Challenge 2000, an agency heavily involved in youth development in the Ohairu electorate.</p>
<p>&quot;This funding boost will a go a long way to helping Challenge 2000 in their quest to support youth in our community,&quot; says Mrs Shanks.</p>
<p>“As a National MP based in Ohariu, I have been extensively involved with Challenge 2000 over the past few years.</p>
<p>“Throughout our relationship I have seen their staff reach out to the community, liaising not only with the welfare and justice sectors, but with all parts of society to best understand the needs of youth.</p>
<p>“They are constantly refining and improving their programmes to ensure that they are relevant to the people they encompass.</p>
<p>“With the unique ability to listen, understand and discern some of the major challenges youth face, Challenge 2000 has empowered literally thousands of young people to make positive change in their lives.</p>
<p>“In my experience, the organisation consistently illustrates a professional, innovative and passionate approach to youth development.</p>
<p>“It is local social services groups like these that are critical to ensuring our communities keep ticking.</p>
<p>&quot;Challenge 2000 does some truly great work for families, and it is great to see their success every day.”</p>
