<p><strong>New Zealanders Call On Govt To Delay ETS</strong></p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Climate Change Spokesman John Boscawen was today pleased to announce the success of day one of his two-day ETS public meetings tour throughout the Waikato and Taranaki regions.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been overwhelmed by the great public attendance at my public meetings yesterday in Morrinsville and Matamata, and again last night in Tamihere on the outskirts of Hamilton,&quot; Mr Boscawen said.</p>
<p>&quot;People across New Zealand - be it in the rural heartland or urban centres - are increasingly worried about the Government’s refusal to delay its ETS in light of changes in the international political climate.</p>
<p>&quot;However, from the response I received at my public meetings, and walking the streets and talking to residents and shopkeepers, in Morrisville and Matamata it is very clear that rural people in particular are very concerned for their future.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes no sense for New Zealand to proceed with an ETS if the world’s major emitters and our major trading partners don’t do so also. If we go it alone, as we are set to do, the climate won’t be better off - but we’ll be poorer. That is ridiculous. New Zealanders are aware of this and are calling for the ETS to be delayed, if not scrapped. It is time John Key and Nick Smith heeded their calls.</p>
<p>&quot;I look forward to meeting with more people at the four public meetings I am holding today,&quot; Mr Boscawen said.</p>
<p>**Public meetings are being held today in:<br>*** Te Awamutu - Te Awamutu Rugby Sports and Recreation Club Inc., 420</p>
<p>Albert Park Drive Te Awamutu, 9.30 am;</p>
<p>* Otorohanga - Otorohanga District Library Meeting Room, 27 Turongo Street, 11.30 am;</p>
<p>* Te Kuiti - St Johns Hall, 2 Jennings Street, Te Kuiti, 2.00 pm; and</p>
<p>* New Plymouth - Beach Street Hall, 40 Beach St, New Plymouth, 7.30 pm.  </p>
