<p>Budget short-changes Pasifika students</p>
<p>Carmel Sepuloni | Thursday, May 27, 2010 11:31</p>
<p>Cuts to tertiary education funding in the 2010 Budget will hit Pasifika students harder than most other groups, says Labour MP Carmel Sepuloni.</p>
<p>“This budget shows the government is all talk and no action when it comes to improving tertiary education participation and achievement for Pasifika Peoples, who are already under-represented in higher education,” Carmel Sepuloni said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Budget does nothing to address the inequality between Pasifika peoples and other New Zealanders, and reduced funding further widens the gap.</p>
<p>&quot;Reductions in funding introduced in the recent Budget include a 14.4% cut in Maori and Polynesian Scholarships, and the end of the $2.15 million Skill Enhancements programme that provided opportunities for Pasifika students to gain higher occupational employment.</p>
<p>&quot;Further restrictions on student loans and allowances provide obstacles to Pasifika students so the student achievement based funding model will see even fewer Pasifika people gaining qualifications.</p>
<p>&quot;Student loan eligibility for new permanent residents will also disproportionately affect Pasifika students. There is now a two year stand down period before new residents can apply for a Student Loan.</p>
<p>“This will restrict the thousands of new residents from the Pacific Islands every year from getting ahead with their education.</p>
<p>&quot;Pasifika people do not need another barrier to success in tertiary education. If this Government was serious about reducing inequality in New Zealand, it would not have introduced these funding cuts and student loan restrictions,&quot; Carmel Sepuloni said.</p>
