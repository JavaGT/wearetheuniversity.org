<p><strong>Tragic Loss of Air Force Lives</strong></p>
<p>Early on ANZAC Day I received the tragic news that three Air Force personnel had been killed in the crash of an Iroquois helicopter near Wellington.</p>
<p>The deaths of Flight Lieutenant Hayden (Muddy) Madsen, Flying Officer Dan Gregory and Corporal Ben Carson reminds us of the hazards the men and women in the New Zealand Defence Force regularly face both at home and when serving overseas.</p>
<p>We ask a great deal of our Defence Force personnel in serving our country. It is no ordinary role. Air Force pilots and crewmen put their lives at risk as they apply themselves to military service, which is very different to flying in the civilian sector. Each flight has risks which we seek to mitigate, but that involves risk that civilian operations never encounter. We are deeply indebted for their dedicated service and commitment. The country mourns their loss.</p>
<p>This is why the Prime Minister returned from overseas to give his personal support. The Defence Force family is our family too. We take pride in the achievements of Muddy, Dan and Ben, but we also share the sorrows of their passing.</p>
<p>The timing of the deaths, on a day of national remembrance for those who have lost their lives serving their country, echoes the past sacrifices of New Zealand families. It was with deep regret that I gave my condolences to the families of these men.</p>
<p><strong>BIG DROP IN UNEMPLOYMENT</strong></p>
<p>This week Statistics New Zealand announced the very good news that unemployment has decreased in the March quarter, from 7.1% to 6%.</p>

<p>This means that the number of people unemployed dropped by 25,000 – the equivalent of the combined population of Takapuna and Milford. This quarterly decrease is the first since December 2007 and has occurred at a time of the year when employment typically falls as a result of seasonal farm work disappearing. This represents the biggest single quarterly drop in unemployment since 1986.</p>
<p>An increase in employment is one of the key aims for the National Government, along with economic growth and better value public services. This is great news for the thousands of New Zealand families that have struggled to cope with the extended recession.</p>
<p><strong>TAX REFORM PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>
<p>Tonight I will be hosting a public meeting on tax reform at the Takapuna War Memorial Hall at 7pm.</p>
<p>New Zealand needs economic growth to create jobs, boost incomes, improve frontline public services, and help New Zealand families get ahead. The programme to achieve this includes options to reform the tax system in this month’s Budget. The reforms will provide the right incentives for hard-working Kiwis to get ahead under their own steam – and they will make the system fairer, more sustainable and more supporting of economic growth.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns that you would like to discuss then this would be a good opportunity.</p>
