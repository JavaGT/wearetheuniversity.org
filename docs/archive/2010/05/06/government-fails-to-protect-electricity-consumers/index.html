<p><strong>Government fails to protect electricity consumers</strong></p>
<p>John Key’s Government has failed to protect householders from rising electricity prices, by voting against the Green Party’s Smart Meter (Consumer Choice) Bill tonight.</p>
<p>“It is ironic the two political parties who claim to support consumer choice have voted against it, said David Clendon, Green Party Consumer Affairs Spokesperson.</p>
<p>The Smart Meter (Consumer Choice) Bill gave effect to the recommendations from the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment’s report Smart electricity meters: How households and the environment can benefit (June 2009). Dr Jan Wright has expressed disappointment that householders are being told by electricity companies they can’t have a really smart electricity meter installed.</p>
<p>“The Bill ensured smart meters really would be smart and that consumers would be offered a choice of tariffs and information to give them power to reduce their electricity costs, but John Key and Rodney Hide clearly don’t want that,” Mr Clendon said.</p>
<p>“Consumers are now stuck paying for a technology they cannot benefit from.</p>
<p>“The Government’s objection that it is too soon to adopt this technology belies the fact it is mandated in Victoria and California.</p>
<p>“Mr Brownlee’s cold feet will ensure big power bills or cold feet for consumers.</p>
<p>“I greatly appreciate the support of the Maori and Labour Parties for this sensible legislation and look forward to its reintroduction under the next government,” Mr Clendon said.</p>
