<p>MEDIA RELEASE: 12 May 2010</p>
<p>Vic Young Nats call on Joyce to let Kiwis into Kiwi Uni&#39;s</p>
<p>IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>In response to Victoria University barring enrolment for new domestic students until 2011, Lower North Island Young Nationals tonight called on the Government to abolish the fees maxima policy.</p>
<p>“As a result of Victoria University being forced to set low fees, it has slammed the door on New Zealanders hoping to enrol” says Chair Lauren Brazier. “The result of the Government cap on fees is that anyone from the around the world can go to Vic - except the very New Zealanders it should be serving.”<br>Fees for international students are higher than domestic fees are not capped.</p>
<p>“The fact Vic is open to more international students shows that the moratorium on enrolment is not because of capacity. This is a direct result of the Governments fee cap” said Miss Brazier. “Many students start their studies into the year, whether it is because they have been working, or because theyve travelled overseas after high school. Many Kiwis who had gained university entrance but waited to take up their study in 2010 at Victoria have now missed out”</p>
<p>“We call on Tertiary Education Minister Stephen Joyce to allow Victoria to set its own fees.”</p>
<p>“If Minister Joyce is concerned that too many students are enrolled he should be looking at alterna-tives to ensure that the best and brightest are getting the opportunities. Having a first come first served system, regardless of academic merit is an absurd way to run university enrollments”</p>
<p>“What are beginning to see is a „low-fees low-supply outcome in New Zealand, starting with Victo-ria. Able kiwi students can no longer enrol in one of New Zealands largest institutions” said Miss Brazier.</p>
