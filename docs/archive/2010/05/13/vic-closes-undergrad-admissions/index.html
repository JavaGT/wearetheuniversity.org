<p><strong>Vic closes undergrad admissions</strong></p>
<p>by Angela Mabey</p>
<p>Victoria University will not accept any new domestic admissions in 2010 following a decision made by the University Council today.</p>
<p>The decision was made after student numbers were predicted to reach 110 per cent of the cap funded by the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC).</p>
<p>The resolution means that no new students, with a few exceptions, will be granted admission to Vic for the rest of 2010.</p>
<p>The decision does not affect international enrolments or current students.</p>
<p>The resolution was passed with only VUWSA President Max Hardy, student representative Conrad Reyners, and former VUWSA President Fleur Fitzsimons voting against it.</p>
<p>Chancellor Ian McKinnon says the change was prompted by a considerable surge in demand and limited resources.</p>
<p>“The University has no further capacity for new domestic undergraduate applicants this year.”</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Pat Walsh told Salient the decision was made “with great reluctance”.</p>
<p>“There is no enthusiam for this decision, it was made to meet our legal obligations and to protect the interests of current students and staff.”</p>
<p>Walsh says “all universities are working in an environment where they must manage their enrolments as outlined in their investment plans, which are agreed to with the Tertiary Education Commission”.</p>
<p>“Our enrolment targets have been based on what we can achieve as an institution and to exceed those means we would not be able to cope with the additional call on teaching resources including staff workloads, space and equipment,” he says.</p>

<p>VUWSA President Max Hardy says the Council should not have made the decision based on the information provided.</p>
<p>“We had hoped the Council would see that such an unattractive decision should not have been made without first having all the appropriate information.</p>
<p>“It is a very difficult position for the University to be in, it was not an easy decision, therefore we were under a substantial obligation to consider this issue very carefully.”</p>
<p>Hardy says “the unexpected decision” will be unfair to potential students who will have been acting under an “entirely reasonable expectation that admissions would remain open.”</p>
<p>The University is currently implementing its plan to manage enrolment numbers in 2011 which involves new admission criteria.</p>
<p>The University is encouraging all potential applicants to reapply before 10 December for study in 2011.</p>
