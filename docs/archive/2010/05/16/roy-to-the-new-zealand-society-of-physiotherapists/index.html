<p>Tena koutou, tena koutou, tena koutou katoa</p>
<p>Good morning Physiotherapists. Thank you Jon (Warren, President of the NZSP) for your warm welcome and your invitation to speak and open your 2010 Conference.</p>
<p>These days I can sometimes be heard saying that in a former life I was a physiotherapist. Physiotherapy was the profession I embarked on straight from school and the pathways established in ones formative years always have a powerful effect on future attitudes, outlook and decisions.</p>
<p>It has been many more years than I care to remember since I treated a patient but I still find myself offering – usually unsolicited – advice on how to use a pair of crutches properly or how to stretch effectively before playing sport. I am frequently not thanked for this advice but once a physio, always a physio!<br>Neurology was my specialty area and it saddens me to see someone who has obviously had a stroke or has a neurological condition and would benefit from even a session or two of mat work in a physio gym to improve their gait or functional activities.</p>
<p>I’m often asked why I would move from a profession that is very well regarded by the public to one that sits somewhere around the level of respect of second-hand car salesmen. There really is no simple answer to that. Politics certainly wasn’t in my master plan, but with changing circumstances came new opportunities and a change of career direction.</p>
<p>Preparing for this speech I was surprised by the amount of change that has taken place in the Physiotherapy profession since I was part of it.</p>
<p>The first piece of legislation I was involved in when I entered parliament in 2002 was the Health Practitioners Competency Assurance (HPCA) Bill (now Act). We battled with the concept of Scopes of Practice and I was particularly grateful at the time for my clinical background and knowledge. I hope we politicians got the balance right between a sensible regulatory environment and ensuring as much as is possible that safeguards for patients are in place.</p>
<p>Scope of Practice was a significant change for all professions covered by the HPCA. Today they are an accepted and useful part of registration.</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes I’ve noticed is the hefty emphasis on research and I congratulate Physiotherapy New Zealand on its valuable contribution in this area. Your conference theme “Working together, Research and Practice” highlights an important partnership. Without up-to-date research to inform evidence-based changes to practice you merely tread water.</p>
<p>Incorporating new findings into your day-to-day clinical practice is an important part of Best Practice and those who embrace and engage in this partnership have a distinct competitive advantage. At the same time those working the area of pure research need to consider the relevance of their work to clinical practice. It shouldn’t be a case of “us” and “them” but both working together.</p>
<p>Change in the entire medical field is evident and it would be fair to say that medicine is moving away from the biomedical model to a more patient centred model.</p>
<p>The patient is a consumer with choices – choices of provider, choices of type of provider and perhaps most importantly, consumers have easy access to information – usually via the internet – which makes them consumers with expectations.</p>
<p>As Minister of Consumer Affairs this is an area I am very interested in. My focus is to promote an environment in which consumers can transact with confidence. But we’re not a business; we’re the health sector I can hear some of you thinking.</p>
<p>The real measure of test of success is whether or not others, especially younger people see a profession or an organisation as something that they want to join.</p>
<p>I was a bit surprised but very pleased when my daughter decided she wanted to be a physio. She started this year at the Otago School. We’re both enjoying comparing notes – what’s the same, what’s new and what’s changed? She is very excited about her future career and I’m excited for her because Physiotherapy is a profession I still feel proud of.</p>
<p>Enjoy your conference. I know you will go home with new ideas and renewed enthusiasm for the work you do and can be justifiably proud of.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
