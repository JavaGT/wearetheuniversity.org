<p><strong>Essentially a cut for tertiary education</strong></p>
<p>Steven Joyce has a deficit of vision for the tertiary education sector, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>“The Minister hasn’t secured any extra funding for tertiary education. Essentially this is a cut,” Green Party Tertiary Education spokesperson Gareth Hughes.</p>
<p>“The Minister for Tertiary education has shifted $200 million into a student achievement based funding model for Universities which will increase inequality.</p>
<p>“Funding systems that focus on student achievement will erode academic standards by forcing lecturers to allow substandard students to pass courses so they retain funding.</p>
<p>“This funding model will also make it harder for people who left school early, come from a disadvantaged background or have problems with the English language to access and afford education.</p>
<p>“The Budget announcement has confirmed student’s worst fears.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing 500,000 Kiwis paying an interest by stealth fee, further limits on access to education for struggling students, and imposes life-time limits on access to loans for students who want stay in higher education,” said Mr Hughes.</p>
