<p>Auckland researcher wins Zonta Science Award</p>
<p>University of Auckland molecular biologist Dr Julie Lim was presented with the 2010 Zonta Science Award in Wellington last night.</p>
<p>Dr Lim, a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Professor Paul Donaldson in the Department of Optometry and Vision Science, studies how medical therapies may be used to delay or prevent the onset of age-related cataract, the world&#39;s leading cause of blindness.</p>
<p>&quot;Julie is an extremely worthy recipient of the Zonta Science Award&quot;, says Professor Donaldson. &quot;She has worked hard to establish herself as an independent vision scientist in the field of cataract research. In a short space of time she has published her work in the top vision science journals, been invited by her peers to present her work at international conferences and was recently awarded a Sir Charles Hercus Health Research Fellowship from the Health Research Council&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;While her achievements are impressive, the manner in which she has achieved them is what marks her as a role model for others, a key criterion of the Zonta Science Award. Julie is an excellent science communicator and through her sense of fun and style breaks the mould of the traditional scientist.&quot;</p>
<p>The Zonta Science Award is presented biennially to an emerging scientist who is a role model and advocate for women in science. It is intended to promote science as a career for women and to encourage those already working in the field. It includes international airfares, a $10,000 cash prize, and a gold and silver medal designed by New Zealand sculptor Tanya Ashken.</p>

<p>Dr Lim will use the award to advance her research towards developing a hyperbaric oxygen model of nuclear cataract in the laboratory. The model will be used to test antioxidant-based therapies as a means of slowing or preventing cataracts. The award will also enable Dr Lim to travel overseas to attend an international conference, develop collaborative partnerships, and learn new skills and techniques.</p>
<p>In addition to scientific merit the award recognises recipients&#39; contribution to the community. Dr Lim is the former President of Ballet Australasia, co-convenor of the &quot;Women to Watch&quot; seminar series, a supervisor and lecturer for university science students, and offers career advice to secondary school science students.</p>
<p>Dr Lim is a former pupil of Diocesan School for Girls, Auckland. She completed her PhD in the School of Biological Sciences at The University of Auckland under the supervision of Associate Professor David Christie before joining the university&#39;s academic staff.</p>
