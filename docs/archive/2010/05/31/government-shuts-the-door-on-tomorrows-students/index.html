<p>Government shuts the door on tomorrow’s students</p>
<p>Anybody wanting to improve their skill levels at a New Zealand university risks being turned away right now, says Labour Spokesperson on Tertiary Education Maryan Street.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government, by its lack of investment in our universities, is compelling them to close their doors on New Zealand students,&quot; said Maryan Street.</p>
<p>&quot;Steven Joyce thinks it is fine to encourage thousands more international students who pay full fees for a quality New Zealand education, but that is a cheapskate&#39;s approach to funding our institutions.</p>
<p>“We welcome international students and all they bring to New Zealand, but they should not be required to be the default providers of funding to our institutions. At the same time, universities are closing their doors to New Zealand enrolments they can&#39;t afford to carry as unfunded students, and New Zealanders are being denied the opportunity to advance their skills,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Frequently, international students take their newly acquired skills back where they came from. We need a government which invests in New Zealanders so that we can grow and develop our economy in a way that is smart and sustainable.</p>
<p>&quot;More restrictive entry criteria also risk turning away people who ought to be able to have a shot at tertiary education. If young people pass the current entry requirements, they should be able to go to university if that is what they want to do.</p>
<p>“Similarly, people who are wanting a second chance at education should be able to enrol at a university and give it a go. Maori and Pasifika students are likely to be over represented amongst these people. We can not afford NOT to invest in them.</p>

<p>&quot;Universities are only bringing in more restrictive entry criteria because they are not funded adequately to meet the increased demand for higher education which the recession has provoked.</p>
<p>“This is the moment to invest, as other countries are doing. Tertiary education is of greater long term benefit to this country than roads. Mr Joyce needs to revisit his priorities,&quot; said Maryan Street.</p>
