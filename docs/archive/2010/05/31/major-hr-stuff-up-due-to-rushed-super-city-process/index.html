<p><strong>Major HR stuff-up due to rushed Super City process</strong></p>
<p>A major error by the Auckland Transition Agency has left hundreds of skilled council staff unable to apply for positions in the new Auckland Council the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>“This failure is another symptom of the rushed and flawed process the Government has used to push through the Super City,” Green Party Super City spokesperson David Clendon said.</p>
<p>Last week thousands of council staff were supposed to receive a letter telling them they had been ‘mapped’ to a certain area of the council, and to give them access to a website where they could apply for suitable jobs.</p>
<p>Mr Clendon said that at least several hundred council staff have not received letters while many others who have are directed to a site which will only allow them to apply for jobs that are clearly not matched to their skill set.</p>
<p>“This shows a lack of respect for council staff, and could lead to lower quality services for all Aucklanders,” Mr Clendon said.</p>
<p>“Morale and motivation are already low among Auckland Council staff and this will worsen the situation.</p>
<p>“Staff seeing this level of ineptitude are more likely to simply leave the council and apply for jobs elsewhere,” Mr Clendon said.</p>
<p>“This is another reason for these highly-skilled and specialised staff to look for work in other localities or the private sector.</p>
<p>“Taking more than a week to apologise for a major mistake like this shows little concern for the feelings or predicament of council staff.</p>
<p>“It is clearly an unfair process if only some staff are able to apply for new jobs, while others are not, through no fault of their own.</p>
<p>“This is definitely not the best way to ensure Auckland Council gets the best staff possible to plan and deliver essential services to the region.</p>
<p>“The Minister of Local Government, Rodney Hide, should take steps to ensure the Auckland Transition Agency does not make similar errors in the future carries out a fair and respectful process for all future jobs,” Mr Clendon said</p>
