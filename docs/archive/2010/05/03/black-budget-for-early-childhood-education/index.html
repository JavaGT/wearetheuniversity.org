<p><strong>Government Looks Set To Deliver “Black Budget” To Early Childhood Education And Parents</strong></p>
<p>The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa says this year’s Budget is shaping up to be a black budget for early childhood education and parents.</p>
<p>The government indicated last week it will move to contain the cost of early childhood education but has not yet released details. It has also been revealed that it is slashing childcare funding for thousands of families by cutting eligibility to the Childcare Subsidy.</p>
<p>11,000 families with household incomes between $77,000 and $99,000 will reportedly have their subsidy cut.</p>
<p>NZEI says that will put enormous pressure on middle income families and have a flow down effect on participation rates in early childhood services.</p>
<p>NZEI Vice President Judith Nowotarski says research shows that children who are involved in quality early childhood education have better educational outcomes later in life.</p>
<p>“We need to be doing all we can to ensure that New Zealand children can access that – not putting up barriers for families,” she says.</p>
<p>NZEI believes the government is moving towards an income testing regime for early childhood including the 20 Hours policy which has benefitted so many children and parents.</p>
<p>“Raising quality and making early childhood education more accessible is a sound investment. The government says it is committed to early childhood education but that commitment is starting to look very hollow,” says Mrs Nowotarski.</p>
