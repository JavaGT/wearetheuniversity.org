<p><strong>Monday, 24 May 2010, 3:14 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Budget takes Women Backwards</strong></p>
<p>While her Government is eroding choice for women in Budget 2010, the Minister of Women&#39;s Affairs Pansy Wong is wasting time doing research that has already been done on pay equity, Labour Women’s Affairs spokesperson Sue Moroney says.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Women’s Affairs funding was unchanged in the budget, which is effectively a funding cut with inflation heading for 6% next year,” Sue Moroney said.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile early childhood funding cuts, health funding that doesn&#39;t keep up with inflation and restrictions on interest-free student loans announced in the budget will all impact negatively on women&#39;s participation in society and the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Add this to ACC cuts to counselling for victims of sexual abuse, night classes being cut and the pay and employment equity unit being closed down last year, and a pattern emerges of a Government that is ignoring the needs of women.</p>
<p>&quot;Women and their families need a strong advocate in Cabinet to go to bat for them - not a Minister who sits idly by while women&#39;s choices are reduced and their lives get harder.</p>
<p>“Women were unfairly hit by the recession, representing 60% of the newly unemployed in the last year and violence against women has increased also.</p>
<p>&quot;Women are going backwards in New Zealand and all the Minister can do is more research,” Sue Moroney said.</p>
