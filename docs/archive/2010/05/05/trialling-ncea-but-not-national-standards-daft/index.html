<p><strong>Wednesday, 5 May 2010, 4:40 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>**Trialling NCEA tweaks but not National Stds is plain daft<br>**<br>Parents and schools deserve an explanation from Education Minister Anne Tolley on why the Government is backing trials for tweaks to NCEA but has stubbornly ruled them out for National Standards in primary schools, Labour’s Education spokesman Trevor Mallard said today.</p>
<p>“The opinion of the Education Ministry on trialling minor changes to standards for NCEA were explained in last week’s Education Gazette: ‘The trials are an important step that allows standards and internal assessment resources to be road-tested with actual students before being finalised’, the Ministry said.</p>
<p>“And yet Mrs Tolley’s view of trialling National Standards in primary schools can be summed up in a comment she made late last year when she said: ‘There will be no concessions, there will be no trial period’.</p>
<p>“Holding two totally opposing positions on the merits of trialling new education standards before they are put into practice is daft. It makes no sense,” Trevor Mallard said.</p>
<p>“But that is exactly the bizarre situation Mrs Tolley and her government have found themselves in – due to their desperate need to protect Prime Minister John Key’s decision to rush through National Standards.</p>
<p>“As the sense of frustration and exasperation among many schools and boards of trustees mounts, Ms Tolley’s insistence on rolling out National Standards with no lead-in time looks more and more like political face saving rather than good policy.</p>

<p>“Mrs Tolley should explain whether she agrees with the Ministry when they say in the Gazette article that:</p>
<p>“‘As a result of what happens in trial classrooms, tweaks and improvements can be made to ensure standards are fit for purpose and clearly understood, are set at the correct level and that the difference between grade levels is appropriate’.”</p>
<p>Mr Mallard said: “If Mrs Tolley agrees that a trial is an important step for the new NCEA standards, why isn&#39;t she allowing this important step for National Standards, rather than forcing schools to waste time and money on implementing something that is untested, unproven and potentially damaging and will inevitably have to change?”</p>
