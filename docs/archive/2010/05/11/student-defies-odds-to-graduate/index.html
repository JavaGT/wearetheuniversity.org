<p><strong>Student defies odds to graduate</strong></p>
<p>Despite a rare genetic disorder that has left him blind, Jamie Parkin will graduate tomorrow with a Bachelor of Arts in history following nine years of extramural study.</p>
<p>Mr Parkin, 28, from Blenheim, is one of only three people in New Zealand with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, which affects sight and speech. He was schooled in the mainstream and developed a love of history at Marlborough Boys’ College. His degree also included papers in classics and politics.</p>
<p>“I&#39;m amazed that I have finished ¬¬– sometimes I felt that I wouldn&#39;t be able to,” he says. “I&#39;m so grateful to everyone who helped me.” He praised the University’s disability support services for providing him with study guides using optical character recognition, enabling his computer to read them to him, and for sending him study materials earlier and liaising with his tutors over deadlines.</p>
<p>The University also funded a support worker to visit him at home each day to read to him. Andrea Barnard, who performed the role for three years, says Mr Parkin worked extremely hard to achieve his goal. “Jamie has a fantastic aural memory that fills me with admiration. He remembers the smallest details of something I read him weeks ago. He is a very kind, gentle and courteous man with a huge capacity for learning.”</p>
<p>Mr Parkin will cross the stage Beth Parkin, says she will be very proud when Jamie crosses the stage at the Regent on Broadway theatre, aided by his sister, Briar. His mother, Beth, father Robbie, grandparents and other members of the family will be there to celebrate his achievement.</p>

<p>Mrs Parkin says her son has always been very patient and shown interest in learning. &quot;I knew he would achieve this as he is very capable and now he is got there we are just shouting ‘whoopee’.” She says he has also received support from readers in the Blenheim community and from the Foundation for the Blind. Determined to continue his love of learning and keen to broaden his skills, he has now enrolled in a Graduate Diploma in English.</p>
