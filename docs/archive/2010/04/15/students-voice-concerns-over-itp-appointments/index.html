<p><strong>Students voice concerns over ITP council appointments</strong></p>
<p>The announcement today of the new Ministerial appointments to Institutes of Technology and Polytechnic councils continues the Government’s concerted steps in limiting community and student voices from their own institutions.</p>
<p>“We are very concerned that this new path the Government is taking with the governance of the polytechnic sector further isolates key stakeholders in the debate around quality,” said Pene Delaney, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).</p>
<p>Today’s announcements follow changes to the Education Act in 2009 removing representative governance in the polytechnic sector, and replacing it with handpicked Ministerial positions, heralding a new era in Government control of public tertiary institutions.</p>
<p>“Students will be concerned that there may be too great a focus on business and finances alone, and the student experience could lose out to so-called efficiency drives which may come at the expense of quality and the range of courses offered,” said Delaney. “It is very hard to see how councils focused largely on business and efficiency outcomes will balance the Minister’s previous calls for enhanced and strengthened pastoral care,” added Delaney.</p>
<p>“This move away from representative governance directly contravenes the Tertiary Education Strategy and its calls from Government for tertiary institutions to be more responsive to student needs. The most efficient and appropriate way to deliver for students is to ensure their voice is heard and supported around the council table and we look forward to working with the minister to achieve this objective,” said David Do, Co-President of NZUSA.</p>
<p>NZUSA notes the inclusion of numerous appointments of Maori to polytechnic councils, and welcomes this move on the part of the Minister. We now also welcome and encourage the inclusion of staff and students to the community representative positions still to be announced, and encourage polytechnic councils to prioritise the inclusion of these key stakeholders at the council table</p>
