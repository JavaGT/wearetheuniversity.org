<p><strong>Youth driving package not bold enough</strong></p>
<p>The youth union movement Stand Up believes the approval by Cabinet today of an increase in the driving age and accompanying provisions will not significantly improve young people’s driving skills because the package lacks any commitment to making professional driver training accessible and cheap for young Kiwis.</p>
<p>Stand Up Convenor James Sleep, said today that whilst the Government has the right intentions it has failed to commit to the most important factor concerning young people’s ability to drive safely.</p>
<p>“Cabinet’s approval today lacks any commitment to help bring the costs of professional training down in order to make it more accessible. The Government’s proposals are simply not bold enough,” says Sleep.</p>
<p>“The Government wouldn&#39;t expect young people to master maths, English or science in secondary school if it cost $100 per lesson and wasn&#39;t available in every community. A similar expectation needs to be applied to the important skill of driving.”</p>
<p>“Thousands of young people are going without professional training, at the expense of lives. The Government must recognise this and commit to training subsidies for first time drivers.”</p>
<p>Stand Up also believes increasing the driving age will hurt thousands of young people across the country that need access to work, education and community activity.</p>
<p>“The Government’s failure to commit to exemptions for young people, particularly those in the heartland of our country, will harm the social and economic fabric of these communities,” concluded Sleep.</p>
