<p><strong>Tuesday 27 April 2010</strong><br><strong>They all scream for ice cream at the Kids’ Choice award</strong></p>
<p>With more than 220 entries to choose from, a group of 14 pupils from View Road Primary School in Waiuku will have their taste buds screaming as they judge the “Kids’ Choice” award for the New Zealand Ice Cream Awards hosted by Massey University’s Food Technology laboratory at the Institute for Nutrition and Human Health on the Albany campus tomorrow.</p>
<p>Now in their fourteenth year, the awards have grown to 12 categories covering a range of options from low fat gelato and sorbet through to premium chocolate and vanilla and the unusually-named category ‘ice cream with inclusions’.</p>
<p>A new packaging category, judged by Senior Lecturer Tom Robinson, will cover products introduced during the previous 12 months and will be evaluated on elements of design, innovation, graphics and labelling. Judging will also take into account the environment impact of the packaging and its compliance with the New Zealand Packaging Accord.</p>
<p>Chief judge Kay McMath has been involved with the awards for the past 5 years and enjoys the children’s honest feedback. “The kids do not hold back in scoring ice creams that meet their approval or declare those that are not so popular,” she says.</p>
<p>Ice creams are scored on a scale where 1 = Yukky and 9 = Yummy and this year the selection ranges from pineapple lumps with pineapple lump gelato to an all-natural and halal rich chocolate ice cream with chocolate ripple.</p>

<p>“Given the fact that many of these ice creams have been developed by past Massey Food Technology graduates, the link to the University is a great opportunity for New Zealand ice cream manufacturers to have their products tested in an objective environment,” says McMath.</p>
<p>The judging will start at 9.30 in Building 26 on the Oteha Rohe campus.
