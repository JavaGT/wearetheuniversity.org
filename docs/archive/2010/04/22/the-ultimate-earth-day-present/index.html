<p><strong>The ultimate Earth Day present</strong></p>
<p>Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei couldn’t be happier that her Member’s Bill giving permanent protection to New Zealand’s wild places was pulled from the ballot on Earth Day, at a time when these places are under assault from mining.</p>
<p>The Crown Minerals (Protection of Public Conservation Land Listed in the Fourth Schedule) Amendment Bill will retain the existing provisions of Schedule 4 protection in the Crown Minerals Act, but would require an Act of Parliament to remove something from Schedule 4, once it has been gazetted.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t have asked for a better Earth Day present,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
<p>“The National Government that created Schedule 4 declared these special places ‘no-go areas for mining’, but now the National Party wants to renege on their promise.  </p>
<p>“I challenge them to restore their credibility and back my Bill.</p>
<p>“Once these places are spoiled, they are lost forever. We’re not talking about the whole conservation estate, just those places of high conservation or aesthetic value within it.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell you how proud I am of the thousands of Kiwis speaking out in opposition to John Key’s plan to desecrate these amazing places.</p>
<p>“To vote against my Bill is to declare that nothing in New Zealand is sacred, that everything is up for sale.</p>
<p>“The Green Party will continue to stand up for what belongs to all of us, and to future generations of New Zealanders,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
