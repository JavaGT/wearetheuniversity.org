<p><strong>Wednesday, 14 April 2010, 3:22 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>More Short-Sighted Plans From Steven Joyce</p>
<p>Selling off the student union building to make up for a shortfall in education funding will do nothing to secure the financial future of our Universities, says Labour’s Tertiary Education Spokesperson, Maryan Street.</p>
<p>“Labour is watching this closely”, said Maryan Street.</p>
<p>“If asset ownership and management issues are unclear and unhelpful to tertiary institutions delivering quality education to New Zealanders, then let&#39;s improve that. But if this is a back door approach to selling off Crown-owned assets, Labour will oppose it.</p>
<p>“Allowing tertiary institutions to rationalise land and buildings which are surplus to requirements or could be used for different purposes, sounds like a good thing to facilitate. But if it simply means institutions will quit valuable assets as a short term response to under-funding, that is quite a different matter.</p>
<p>“This just looks like a quick fix for the here and now and a way Steven Joyce can try and make up the cash shortfall tertiary institutions are facing without digging into the governments budget.</p>
<p>“Mr Joyce will have to make it clear what his intentions are for the institutions and their assets.</p>
<p>“Clarity of vision for the long term delivery of quality tertiary education is what matters here, and Mr Joyce has yet to provide that”, said Maryan Street.</p>
