<p><strong>Platform festival to showcase the arts at UC</strong></p>
<p>The University of Canterbury’s College of Arts will showcase the wealth of artistic talent among its staff and students during the third biennial Platform arts festival next month.</p>
<p>Platform, which runs from 20-30 May, will showcase all that the University has to offer in the arts – from opera, music recitals and art exhibitions to theatre, lectures and film.</p>
<p>Featuring work and performances by students and staff, the 11-day festival will be staged at various locations in the central city and on the University’s Ilam campus.</p>
<p>Highlights include the performance by UC voice students of two short operas – Emmanuel Chabrier’s <em>A Faulty Education</em> (<em>Une education manquee</em>) and Giovanni Pergolesi’s <em>Maid into Mistress</em> (<em>La Serva Padrona</em>); a piano recital by UC School of Music lecturer Gao Ping and leading New Zealand pianist Michael Houstoun; a presentation by the Different Light Theatre Company, whose performers all have intellectual disabilities; a performance of Aristophanes’ 2500-year-old political comedy <em>Wasps</em>; and a showcase or arias performed by Dame Malvina Major and students in the University’s Voice Programme.</p>
<p>Festival Director Greg Latham said Platform will give the wider Christchurch community a chance to see the next generation of artists and performers work alongside the University’s world-class staff to create what will be a dynamic and unique event.</p>
<p>“The combined talent of the contributors is quite an extraordinary collection and audiences will be able to experience a diverse programme of superb quality. Many of the events are free to the public, with moderate prices across the board for some very exceptional shows.”</p>
<p>Other events to look out for during the festival include the Free Theatre’s production of Christopher Marlowe’s 16th century play <em>Doctor Faustus</em>; a piano recital by UC’s Professor of Piano Michael Endres; a performance of new music by established and emerging Canterbury composers by the Silencio Ensemble; a series of lectures by College of Arts staff; a concert by young musicians from the University’s Pettman Junior Academy of Music; and an evening of hearty food, music and verse from Thomas Hardy’s England at The Octagon Restaurant.</p>
<p>A full schedule of events can be found on the Platform website at <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/platform/">www.canterbury.ac.nz/platform/</a>. Tickets for events are available through Ticketek.</p>
