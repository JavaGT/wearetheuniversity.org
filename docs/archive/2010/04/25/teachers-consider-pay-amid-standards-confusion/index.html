<p><strong>Teachers To Consider Pay Claim Amid Ongoing National Standards Confusion</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of primary and intermediate school teachers will be attending meetings over the next three weeks to decide on their pay claim and discuss the ongoing confusion around National Standards.</p>
<p>Their union NZEI Te Riu Roa, which represents 27,000 teachers, will be holding 250 meetings nationwide. Teachers will be asked to consider what they believe would be a fair and reasonable pay claim to reflect their value and the huge contribution they make in educating all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>NZEI negotiations team leader Frances Guy says “teachers are well aware that the economy is picking up and other sectors have had increases. They do not want to be left behind and will be looking for a deal to move them forward.”</p>
<p>“Our salaries are still well behind our counterparts in Australia. If the government is serious about closing the pay gap, and ensuring our teachers stay in New Zealand, that cannot be ignored,” she says.</p>
<p>The nationwide meetings will also focus on the ongoing concern around the shambolic rollout of National Standards.</p>
<p>“Teachers are concerned by the untried and untested nature of National Standards and have no confidence in implementing them,” says Frances Guy.</p>
<p>Meetings start on Monday 26 April. The claim for negotiation of the Primary Teachers Collective Agreement will be finalised and presented to the Ministry of Education on May 21. Talks are scheduled to get underway in June.</p>
