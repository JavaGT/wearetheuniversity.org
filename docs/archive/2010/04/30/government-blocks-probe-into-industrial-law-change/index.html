<p>**Government blocks probe into industrial law changes<br>**</p>
<p>The decision by the Industrial Relations Select Committee to dismiss a petition to review the Employment Relations Amendment Act is a blow for Kiwi workers, Labour’s Darien Fenton said today.</p>
<p>“The petition submitted by the Council of Trade Union President Helen Kelly sought to place further scrutiny on the industrial law changes National moved to put in place soon after it was elected,” Darien Fenton said.</p>
<p>“Labour believes National’s changes such as the 90 day ‘fire at will’ law are causing insecurity for thousands of workers.</p>
<p>“These issues need to be addressed and a Select Committee investigation calling for public submissions would have brought them to the fore.</p>
<p>“We wanted to hear from the petitioners about the implementation of the Employment Relations Amendment Act one year after its introduction to hear their views on its workability or otherwise.</p>
<p>“The fact that the Government blocked an investigation on its own industrial law changes speaks volumes on the eve of May Day, a day of celebration of workers’ rights,” Darien Fenton said.</p>
