<p><strong>Tuesday, 20 April 2010, 5:11 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University">Massey University</a></strong></p>
<p>Stannard To Head New School Of Sport</p>
<p>Associate Professor Stephen Stannard has been appointed to head the University’s new School of Sport and Exercise.</p>
<p>The initiative recognises the importance of sport, exercise, wellbeing and lifestyle management as well as the growing significance of areas such as coaching and sports management.</p>
<p>Dr Stannard is currently Director of Exercise and Sport Science in the Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health. A former Australian representative racing cyclist, he has been at the University since 2003 and his area of specialist research is exercise physiology.</p>
<p>He will work with the school implementation committee, chaired by Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Academic and International) Professor Ingrid Day, on the next stage of the establishment process.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey announced the appointment at a presentation evening for the University’s Academy of Sport at the Manawatu campus. The academy provides a scholarship and support programme for talented athletes, many of national and international ranking, studying at the Manawatu campus.</p>
<p>Mr Maharey described Dr Stannard as a leading researcher in his field at the forefront of a proposal to have an Olympic-class velodrome built at the campus. “Massey has a long history of excellence in the areas of sports management and more recently, exercise science. Bringing the programmes together under a new school is an important step in establishing Massey as New Zealand’s university of choice for sport-related teaching and research.”</p>
