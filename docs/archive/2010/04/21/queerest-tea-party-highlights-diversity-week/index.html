<p><strong>Queerest Tea Party and MP’s Visit Highlights of OUSA Diversity Week</strong>  </p>
<p>OUSA Diversity Week, currently underway on Otago University campus, offers a range of activities for students to attend.</p>
<p>The annual highlight of the week was today’s Queerest Tea Party, on the OUSA Lawn.</p>
<p>“The Queerest Tea Party allows everyone to come together and celebrate diversity whilst drinking tea and eating cake. It’s also a chance to say ‘hey, we might identify differently in terms of our sexuality or gender, but there’s nothing to be afraid of. Come drink some tea with us’ ” says OUSA Queer Rep, Rosalin MacKenzie.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Greens MP Kevin Hague will present prizes for the Diversity Week Short Story and Poetry Competition and will address interested staff and students as the Green Party’s Rainbow Issues spokesperson.</p>
<p>“This is a fantastic opportunity for staff and students to come along and meet Kevin and to discuss the contemporary challenges for Rainbow politics” Says James Burford, OUSA’s Queer Coordinator.</p>
<p>Other Diversity Week events include a Queer Yoga and Creativity Workshop, a seminar on Queer (ing) Politics and Future, a Respectful Conversation exploring questions of sexuality with University Chaplain Greg Hughson, and Parfait at 12 Below: UniQ’s night out.</p>
<p>OUSA, along with the OUSA-affiliated UniQ, organise OUSA Diversity Week every year in order to celebrate and explore the gender diversity of students on campus.<br>“Diversity Week is to affirm and celebrate (not just tolerate) the diverse queer* whānau” says Rosalin.</p>
