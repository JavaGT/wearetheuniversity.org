<p><strong>Confusion Reigns Over National Standards</strong></p>
<p>As schools go back for Term Two, confusion reigns over the implementation of National Standards, says the education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa.</p>
<p>The Education Minister claims implementation is going well because schools have rushed to participate in the first round of National Standards training workshops. Those workshops were held for principals and senior teachers who will be expected to train others and lead the implementation process.</p>
<p>NZEI President Frances Nelson says the reason so many schools signed up for training is because school leaders are under immense pressure to implement and are desperate for information.</p>
<p>“They were not involved in the development of the Standards and need to be in a position to assess them, discuss them and give feedback,” she says.</p>
<p>“What we’re hearing is that people are more confused than ever because the Standards don’t seem to fit in with what schools are already doing in terms of assessment. There is also no clarity around how the Standards will be implemented consistently or how they are expected to make a difference to student achievement.”</p>
<p>“Many schools are adopting a wait-and-see approach or are delaying implementation, not because they want to break the law but because they are concerned about the untested nature of the Standards and the haste with which they have been introduced,” says Ms Nelson.</p>
<p>Thousands of parents, schools and communities around New Zealand have voiced serious concern about National Standards and continue to call on the government to trial them.</p>
<p>“The government needs to stop and listen to that and engage in meaningful discussions with the sector to find a way forward. If it doesn’t its National Standards policy will remain in total disarray.”</p>
