<p>Schools Urged To Go Pink And Take A Stand Against Bullying</p>
<p>The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa is urging schools and communities to go pink on Wednesday 28 April in support of Pink Shirt Day and bullying awareness.</p>
<p>Bullying is an issue which New Zealand schools take seriously and recent research shows children and young people consistently rate bullying as one of their biggest concerns. The aim of Pink Shirt Day is to show that bullying will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>NZEI, which represents thousands of principals, teachers and education workers, says bullying comes in many different forms and bullies now have a number of different tools at their fingertips.</p>
<p>“In many ways - with texting, the internet and social networking sites such as Facebook and Bebo - the nature of bullying has become more insidious and sophisticated,” says NZEI President Frances Nelson.</p>
<p>“There are many effective anti-bullying programmes in place but schools and teachers need to keep their eyes and ears open to ensure they are providing safe and positive environments for all students.”</p>
<p>Pink Shirt Day provides an opportunity to raise awareness about bullying and highlight the issues.</p>
<p>Schools, parents and communities need to get behind Pink Shirt Day and take a stand against bullying.</p>
