<p><strong>Thursday, 8 April 2010, 5:28 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>**Cost of Government’s rush for water start to emerge<br>**<br>Increasingly critical reaction in Canterbury reveals major fears that the Government’s rush to create new water sources in the region will come at the cost of the environment, says Labour’s water spokesman Brendon Burns.</p>
<p>Brendon Burns says Environment Canterbury’s axed chairman and former National MP Alec Neill has now asked whether the Government can balance environmental and economic interests having replaced ECan with commissioners. “He is quoted today as saying someone has to be the gatekeeper to ensure environmental concerns are properly addressed.</p>
<p>“Mr Neill says in today’s Federated Farmers newspaper that while environmental issues are not of concern in China, New Zealand has to maintain its clean green image. Clearly he is concerned that the government will not get the balance right in its push to put new water schemes in place from next year in Canterbury.”</p>
<p>Brendon Burns says similar comments have been made to Environment Minister Nick Smith by Murray Rogers, chair of the Water Rights Trust, a key player in bringing together Canterbury’s Water Management Strategy.</p>
<p>“The strategy was hammered out over some years by environmental and farming interests, but the rushed legislation, axing ECan and giving commissioners powers over Water Conservation Orders on Canterbury rivers, puts it at risk.</p>
<p>“Mr Rogers says the Government is also risking civil disorder by removing Water Conservation Orders from a process of consultation or recourse to the courts.”</p>
<p>Brendon Burns said the Government had also offended former National candidate and environmentalist Guy Salmon with the legislation.</p>
<p>“The list of disaffected names is growing. If democracy and planning can be denied the way they are in Canterbury, New Zealanders have every reason to share the fears being expressed in Canterbury.”</p>
