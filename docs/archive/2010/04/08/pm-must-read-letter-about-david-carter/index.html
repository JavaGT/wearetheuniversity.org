<p><strong>PM must read letter about David Carter and the Hurunui</strong></p>
<p>The Prime Minister or one of his staff must find and read a letter sent months ago regarding Agriculture Minister David Carter, said Green Party Co-Leader Dr Russel Norman.</p>
<p>Forest and Bird’s general manager Mike Britton wrote to John Key late last year about comments David Carter had made to Forest and Bird’s South Island manager, Chris Todd, at the Canterbury water management strategy launch September 3 2009.</p>
<p>According to Mr Britton’s letter dated 3 December 2009 David Carter had &quot;requested strongly&quot; that Forest and Bird and other applicants for a Water Conservation Order for the Hurunui River should freeze their application.</p>
<p>“There was a judicial process underway regarding the Hurunui River and therefore the Minister’s actions in trying to intervene were inappropriate,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“It is possible that Mr Key was busy at the Copenhagen conference around the time Forest and Bird was trying to alert him to Mr Carter’s behaviour.</p>
<p>“This matter was raised in the House prior to Easter. If the Prime Minister still hasn’t managed to get his hands on the multiple copies of the letter floating around Parliament I’m willing to have one couriered to the Ninth Floor.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister needs to acquaint himself immediately with all the facts about Minister Carter and his dealings with the Hurunui and if necessary take appropriate action.”</p>
