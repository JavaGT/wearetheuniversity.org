<p><strong>Monday, 12 April 2010, 3:09 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>**Labour mourns with Poland<br>**</p>
<p>The Labour Party extends its deepest sympathies to the Government and people of Poland following the tragic deaths of Polish President Lech Kaczysnki, his wife, and so many other respected Poland officials, politicians and academics in a plane crash in western Russia.</p>
<p>“We in Labour have been deeply shocked by Poland’s immense loss,” says the party’s Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Chris Carter.</p>
<p>“As well as the President and his wife, Poland has lost its last leader-in-exile from the World War II years, the heads of branches of the Polish armed forces, respected historians, and many heroes of the Solidarity and independence movements.</p>
<p>“In the aftermath of this terrible tragedy the world has again seen the best characteristics of the Polish people. Poles, whatever their political allegiances, have joined together to show their respects for the deceased and to care for one another in this time of national mourning.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders of Polish descent left a beautiful floral tribute at the Polish Memorial in Wellington. This gesture reflects the special connection that New Zealand has with the people of Poland.</p>
<p>“That connection was forged in World War II under a Labour Government, led by Peter Fraser, when the world’s first refugee quota was created. That first quota was almost entirely filled by Polish children who had been orphaned. Labour also understands the special role that Poles played bringing to an end totalitarian dictatorship in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>“The Labour Party recognises that this tragic accident will particularly affect those Polish families who have lost loved ones.</p>
<p>“Our deepest sympathies go to those directly affected by this terrible tragedy,” Chris Carter said</p>
