<p><strong>The Carter code cracked</strong></p>
<p>Minister of Agriculture David Carter has finally come clean over why Environment Canterbury was sacked, and his explanation has frightening implications for local democracy throughout New Zealand, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The Carter Code was not a hard one to crack, but he’s come clean anyway,&quot; Green Party Local Government spokesperson Sue Kedgley said.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday Mr Carter confirmed what we all deciphered weeks ago: ECan was not sacked because they were dysfunctional but because they were not pushing the Key Government’s pro-irrigation agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;And he is now threatening to do the same with all other Regional Councils in New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Carter said in a speech to the Irrigation New Zealand conference in Christchurch yesterday: &quot;I would have thought what happened recently with Environment Canterbury would be a signal to all regional councils to work a bit more constructively with their farmer stakeholders.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley said, &quot;This is a direct threat to all regional councils — don&#39;t get offside with farmers or you will be sacked.</p>
<p>&quot;He is saying this Government will get rid of any Council that doesn’t pursue its pro-irrigation, pro-farmer agenda. This is exactly the same reason that Commodore Bainimarama got rid of democracy — it was an obstacle to their plans.</p>
<p>&quot;This is what National thinks about democracy — it is something that can be got rid of when it’s inconvenient and restored when it sees fit.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has many other agendas. Will it sack any other Council that doesn’t pursue any other agenda — like building more motorways?</p>
<p>&quot;Will it sack the Wellington Regional Council if they don’t fast track the construction of Transmission Gully and other expensive roading projects if construction companies come sulking?” Ms Kedgley said.</p>
