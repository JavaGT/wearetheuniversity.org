<p>1 April 2010 <strong>Media Statement</strong></p>
<p>**<br>ECE Election Pledges Broken  </p>
<p>Education Minister Anne Tolley is preparing the early childhood education sector for cuts in funding that will increase costs to parents, Labour Spokesperson for Early Childhood Education, Sue Moroney says.**</p>
<p><strong>Notes released today from a meeting between the Early Education Federation and the Minister quoted the Minister as saying ‘there are some tough decisions to be made’ and ‘over the last 5 years there has been a significant shift from parent cost to government cost’.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Minister Anne Tolley also confirmed that the Government will not deliver on an election pledge it made to improve staff ratios for under-twos in this term of Government. That work has been pushed out beyond the next election.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Prime Minister had trumpeted early childhood education as a top priority for his Government but already it is being sidelined by an incompetent Minister who has been completely distracted by her shambolic implementation of national standards,&quot; said Sue Moroney.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The Minister&#39;s proposal to introduce shorter courses for primary teachers and those with overseas qualifications to achieve an ECE teaching qualification is also on hold.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Anne Tolley has already had tertiary education taken off her - her failure to make progress in early childhood education shows she is struggling with this part of her portfolio too.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Quality education for our young children is a top priority for Labour and we won&#39;t stand by while the great progress we made is eroded by incompetency - neither should John Key,” said Sue Moroney.</strong></p>
