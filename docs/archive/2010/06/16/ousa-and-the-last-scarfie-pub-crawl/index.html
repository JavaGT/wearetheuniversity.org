<p><strong>Wednesday, 16 June 2010, 4:35 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students'_Association">Otago University Students&#39; Association</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>OUSA and the Last Scarfie Pub Crawl</strong></p>
<p>OUSA President Harriet Geoghegan is not one to sit back and wait for events to unfold. She has spent the past few weeks proactively encouraging and working with the community, the university and students to ensure Castle Street remains as safe as possible during the closure of the Gardens Tavern.</p>
<p>Management of the Gardens Tavern (‘the Gardies’) will let no further patrons in after the All Blacks game starts at 7:30pm and free buses will transport people to the ‘But We’re Still Here’ official ‘afterparty’ at the Cook and the 10 Bar street party in the Octagon from 9pm.</p>
<p>Harriet and other members of OUSA’s Executive, Campus Watch, the Campus Cop and the Fire Service have spent much of today visiting students living on Castle Street to pass out leaflets advising them what events are going on, what to do if unwanted partiers invade their front yard and what they could potentially get into trouble for with police and the University.</p>
<p>“We want to manage this so students can celebrate the closing of a well loved Dunedin pub and those still studying can do so with no fear of riot police on the street” said Geoghegan.</p>
<p>Studying students will be able to use any of five 24 hour computer rooms on campus to avoid disruptions.</p>
<p>Geoghegan encourages students who live in Castle Street to throw out all their rubbish on Friday – there will be a one off additional rubbish collection – and to take their furniture from their front porch.</p>
