<p><strong>VUWSA Exec Member Guilty of Misconduct</strong></p>
<p>By Angela Mabey</p>
<p>VUWSA executive member James Sleep has been found guilty of misconduct by the VUWSA exec, following comments made in his <em>Salient</em> column earlier this month.</p>
<p>VUWSA received a formal complaint following the column’s publication in the 3 May issue of <em>Salient</em>.</p>
<p>Sleep made reference in the column to “the rich kids who you might find yourself sitting next to”, and “the one’s [sic] that seem to think it’s a status boost to say they live in Weir House”.</p>
<p>The exec found Sleep had breached the VUWSA Code of Conduct (CoC) by making negative and disrespectful comments about VUWSA members.</p>
<p>The CoC requires VUWSA exec members to “treat everyone fairly and with respect” and “Show respect to the person…”.</p>
<p>When asked to make a public apology for the comments made in the column, Sleep initially refused to do so.</p>
<p>“No, that is not something I will be doing. I am not prepared to make a public apology in <em>Salient</em>. I don’t see why I need to.”</p>
<p>Following the meeting, Sleep contacted <em>Salient</em> to say he had “had second thoughts” and would apologise in a later issue of <em>Salient</em>.</p>
<p>Sleep did acknowledge using the stereotypes “was unacceptable” and agreed to apologise to the complainant, but only after it was suggested by the exec.</p>
<p>Sleep’s column was discussed in a recent select committee hearing about Roger Douglas’s Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill, a bill which would introduce voluntary membership to all students’ associations.</p>
<p>VUWSA President Max Hardy told <em>Salient</em> he was disappointed that Sleep had made the comments.</p>
<p>“The accountability of executive members is ultimately to the students.</p>
<p>“VUWSA expects higher standards of ethical conduct of its executive members that we generally expect of the general public.”</p>
<p>Sleep told Hardy during the investigation that he did not believe the phrases were offensive, and said he was attempting to be “deliberately provocative”.</p>
<p>Hardy said in his report to the exec that Sleep “showed a general disrespect to the process” and “did not take the allegations seriously”.</p>
<p>Sleep told the exec that he accepted the misconduct finding, but disputed that he had not taken the complaint seriously.</p>
<p>Sleep says turning up to the meeting and talking about the complaint was enough to be seen as taking it seriously.</p>
<p>Exec members were concerned by Sleep’s actions following the meeting with Hardy, when he was heard laughing about the issue.</p>
<p>The misconduct decision does not require the exec to take any disciplinary action against Sleep.</p>
<p>Three misconduct findings would result in serious misconduct and further action would be taken at that point.</p>
<p>An agreement between Salient and VUWSA means that all columns submitted by exec members are not edited by Salient, subject to libel laws, before being published.</p>
