<p>Smoking increases risk of depression</p>
<p>New University of Otago, Christchurch, research published today in the prestigious British Journal of Psychiatry suggests smoking could increase the risk of depression.</p>
<p>The study was done by researchers from the University of Otago’s long-running Christchurch Health &amp; Development Study.</p>
<p>It found people who were dependent on nicotine were more than twice as likely to have symptoms of depression as those who were not nicotine dependent.</p>
<p>The study involved more than 1000 people, who were asked at ages 18, 21 and 25, about their smoking habits and whether they had symptoms of depression.</p>
<p>Sophisticated statistical analysis of results found smoking increases the risk of developing depressive symptoms, rather than people being more likely to smoke because they are depressed.</p>
<p>Lead researcher Professor David Fergusson says “our findings are consistent with the conclusion that there is a cause and effect relationship between smoking and depression, in which cigarette smoking increases the risk of developing symptoms of depression.’’</p>
<p>“The reasons for this relationship are not clear. However, it’s possible that nicotine causes changes to neurotransmitter activity in the brain, leading to an increased risk of depression.’’</p>
<p>Professor Fergusson emphasises the study does not prove smoking causes depression but rather increases a person’s risk.</p>
<p>The study was funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand.</p>
