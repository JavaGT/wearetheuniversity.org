<p><strong>Closer to understanding how tumours evade immune responses</strong></p>
<p>Scientists are one step closer to understanding how to design effective anti-tumour vaccines, due to PhD research by a recent Victoria University graduate.</p>
<p>Dr Haley Ataera, who graduated from Victoria with a PhD in Biomedical Sciences in May, focused her PhD thesis on trying to understand how regulatory T cells (Treg), which prevent the body’s immune response from damaging itself, work and which cells of the immune system they negatively affect.</p>
<p>“The human immune system is a series of checks and balances,” says Dr Ataera.</p>
<p>“Our immune system is able to launch powerful responses against many diseases, including cancer. However, it also requires mechanisms to suppress the immune response to avoid self-damage. Tumours can hijack these suppressive mechanisms and evade the immune response.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent work has suggested that Treg can destroy cells of the immune system that are required to eliminate the tumour using a pathway that is similar to that used by the immune system to destroy pathogens, such as viruses or tumours. I demonstrated that this does not appear to be the case in some tumours.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Ataera believes this work will help in the design of more effective anti-tumour vaccines in the future.</p>
<p>In June, Dr Ataera is taking up a new position at the center for Cell And Gene Therapy (CAGT) at the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA where she will work on developing an anti-tumour vaccine to treat the cancer neuroblastomas, one of the most common cancers in childhood and the most common in infancy.</p>
<p>Dr Ataera completed her PhD with the assistance of a Health Research Council grant. Her primary, secondary and tertiary supervisors were Professor Franca Ronchese, Dr Ian Hermans and Dr Anne La Flamme respectively.</p>
<p>All of the PhD work was performed at the Malaghan Institute, based on Victoria University’s Kelburn Campus.</p>
