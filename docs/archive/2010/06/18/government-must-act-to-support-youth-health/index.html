<p><strong>Friday, 18 June 2010, 9:39 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Government must act to support youth health</strong>  </p>
<p>A petition has been tabled in the House by Labour spokesperson for Youth Affairs, Jacinda Ardern asking the National-led Government to show its commitment to funding Youth Health Centres and One Stop Shops around the country.</p>
<p>The petition, which calls on the Government to provide sustainable funding for the thirteen Youth Health One Stop Shops and Youth Health Centres around New Zealand, came about after 198 Youth Health Centre in Christchurch announced its closure earlier this year, and Southland Youth One Stop Shop facing a similar fate.</p>
<p>“Youth One Stop Shops and Youth Health Centres around New Zealand are in serious jeopardy of losing funding as the Government tries to find ways to cut costs, with some DHBs responding by changing the level of support these vital services receive. Some centres receive no DHB support at all,” Jacinda Ardern said.</p>
<p>“198 in Christchurch, which was one of the most long standing youth health service providers in the country, had about 4000 young people on its books when it was forced to look at closure in April of this year.”</p>
<p>A Ministry of Health report released in September of last year found that: ‘Youth Health One stop shops provide an incredibly important service in our communities and cater for health needs of some of our most vulnerable young people.’</p>
<p>The report also stated these services provided “a range of accessible, youth friendly health, social and other services....at little or no cost to young people. It is clear that these facilities have real value to thousands of youth across New Zealand.”</p>
<p>“I urge the Health Select Committee to work alongside the New Zealand Aotearoa Adolescent Health and Development network to get a better understanding of the role youth health services currently play and to consider options to address the situation,&quot; Jacinda Ardern said.</p>
<p>“It is imperative that we find a solution before we face any further closures youth health centres.”</p>
