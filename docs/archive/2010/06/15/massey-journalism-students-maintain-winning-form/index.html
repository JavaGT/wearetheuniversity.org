<p><strong>Massey journalism students maintain winning form at Qantas Media Awards</strong></p>
<p>Massey journalism graduate Amanda Fisher has won this year’s Qantas Media Award for student journalism, the third time in the past four years a Massey student has taken out the prestigious prize.</p>
<p>Laura Jackson took out the award last year and Jenny Macintyre in 2007.</p>
<p>Two of the finalists this year were Massey graduates, with Michael Dickison also making it to the top four.</p>
<p>Five other recent Massey graduates also picked up awards at the ceremony.</p>
<p>Matt Calman won for best junior general news story, Tom Fitzsimons for best junior newspaper business feature and best junior arts and entertainment story, Bronwyn Torrie for best junior crime/justice story, Kirsty Johnston for best junior science/environmental story and Sean Gillespie for best junior politics feature.</p>
<p>The wins were announced at the awards gala dinner in Auckland on June 11.</p>
<p>Ms Fisher’s winning portfolio included a piece on the tragic death of an East Timorese boy, an investigation into a contaminated residential site, the proposed introduction of bus lanes into a pedestrian shopping mall, and the relocation of a New Zealand company’s manufacturing operations overseas.</p>
<p>The judge said Ms Fisher’s portfolio was very strong.</p>
<p>&quot;They were stories that many experienced journalists would have been proud of.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Fisher said she was &quot;elated&quot; and &quot;honoured&quot; by her win.</p>
<p>The stories were published when Ms Fisher studied the Graduate Diploma of Journalism at Massey in 2009.</p>
<p>All the Massey lecturers had been very supportive during the course, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;At undergraduate level you’re just one student in a class of 600, but on the journalism course the lecturers give you lots of one-to-one tutoring.&quot;</p>
<p>The lecturers emphasised the need for tenacity and to keep the big picture in mind when investigating stories, she said.</p>
<p>She also paid tribute to fellow finalist Michael Dickison.</p>
<p>&quot;I was doubly honoured that he was a finalist.</p>
<p>&quot;During the course Michael was a sounding board for many of my ideas.&quot;</p>
<p>As well as a certificate, Ms Fisher received $500 from the New Zealand Journalists’ Training Organisation for her win.</p>
