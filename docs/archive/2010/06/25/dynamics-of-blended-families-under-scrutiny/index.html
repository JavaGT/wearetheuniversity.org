<p>Friday, June 25, 2010<br>Dynamics of blended families under scrutiny</p>
<p>The delicate dynamics within stepfamilies are the subject of simultaneous Massey and Victoria University studies funded by the Families Commission.</p>
<p>Stepfamilies, commonly known as blended families, make up an estimated 10 per cent of all New Zealand households with children. The researchers want to find out how parents and children manage relationships when one of the primary caregivers is not the biological parent.</p>
<p>Massey researchers, led by Celia Falchi, a doctoral student in the School of Psychology based at the Wellington campus, are looking specifically at blended families that have been together for at least two years to see how they manage rules, discipline, displays of affection, privileges and opportunities.</p>
<p>Ms Falchi says the research will help organisations and individuals working with families in a professional capacity or on a voluntary basis, such as government departments, charities and churches. It could also directly benefit blended families with &quot;useful strategies and information to achieve more harmonious and functional relationships&quot;.</p>
<p>At the same time researchers from the Roy McKenzie Centre for the Study of Families at Victoria University, who are looking a the challenges of re-partnering for blended families who have been together for a minimum of five years and have a child or children aged between nine and 16. The deputy director of the centre, Dr Jeremy Robertson, plans to talk to stepfamilies in person as “each person has their own unique perspective on family life”.</p>
<p>Both research teams would welcome approaches from members of families who meet the respective criteria and are willing to be interviewed.</p>
