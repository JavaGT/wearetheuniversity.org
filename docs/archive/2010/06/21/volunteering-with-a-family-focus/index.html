<p><strong>Monday, 21 June 2010, 4:15 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Volunteering with a family focus</p>
<p>Volunteer awareness week is underway with the objective of “raising people, not money,” a theme which highlights the meaningful contribution we can all make to our communities, says Labour’s Dunedin South MP Clare Curran.</p>
<p>The theme this year is Volunteering Across the Generations which places emphasis on the different types of volunteer work available to suit particular generations and raises awareness around opportunities for family volunteering.</p>
<p>“As a community, we are increasingly time-poor and this week I want to congratulate those who step up and serve their community by donating their time and their families time, to those in need,” Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>Volunteer Otago supports approximately 122 organisations and have registered 550 new volunteers this year alone.<br>“Volunteer week provides a welcome opportunity to thank current volunteers and encourage others to get involved,” Clare Curran said</p>
<p>“Support doesn’t have to be a huge commitment. Volunteer Otago offers a range of opportunities for the whole family to volunteer in some form.”</p>
<p>One of the many initiatives taking place this week is the campaign to get 100 people to sign up for 100 good deeds. Would-be volunteers can sign up this Thursday in the Octagon where Volunteer Otago will hold a fundraising BBQ.</p>
<p>“Whether you are a high school student interested in volunteering at your local opshop on the weekend, a father interested in becoming a sports coach for your local school, or a family interested in a community focused activity, this week is the week to get involved.” Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>Volunteer Awareness Week runs from 20-26 June and is co-ordinated by Volunteering New Zealand.</p>
