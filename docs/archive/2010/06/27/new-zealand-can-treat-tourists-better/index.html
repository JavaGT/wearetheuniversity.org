<p><strong>New Zealand Can Treat Tourists Better</strong></p>
<p>The Government needs to do more to address the damage violence against tourists is having on our international reputation, Labour Tourism spokesperson Kelvin Davis says.</p>
<p>“Associate Tourism Minister Johnathon Coleman is right when he says crime needs to be addressed for New Zealand to continue to be an attractive tourist and study destination, unfortunately his government has done little to address the problem.</p>
<p>“The National Government as been asleep at the wheel in addressing the drivers of crime, Kelvin Davis says. There was a lot of tough talk before the election of dealing to criminals, but the tough talk has not converted into results.</p>
<p>“Tourists appear to be easy prey and yet the Ministry of Tourism has done nothing to address the issue.</p>
<p>“There are no in flight suggestions to incoming tourists on what they can do to minimise the risks to them. There has been no campaign to inform New Zealanders of the value of tourism and how we could practice the core tourism value of &#39;manaakitanga&#39; to our visitors.</p>
<p>“There is also little or no information available in communities to explain to tourists where they should go for help if they feel threatened or lost.</p>
<p>“Tourists arrive in New Zealand and are on their own. Despite the economic value they contribute to the New Zealand economy, New Zealand does not go out of its way to prove to tourists that it cares for them other than to milk their wallets dry.</p>
<p>“With thousands of expected tourists arriving for next year&#39;s Rugby World Cup, we need to do a lot more to ensure they all have a safe and hospitable visit to our shores,” Kelvin Davis said.</p>
