<p><strong>Sunday, 6 June 2010, 10:47 am</strong><br><strong>Speech: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party">The Maori Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>J Reuben Clark Law Society Asia Pacific Conference,</strong><br><strong>Church College of New Zealand Student Centre; Hamilton</strong><br><strong>Saturday 5 June 2010, 8.40am</strong><br><strong>Rahui Katene, MP for Te Tai Tonga</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>‘Advocacy in the development of policy and value-based community initiatives’</em></strong></p>
<p>In the June edition of the New Zealand Fire-service magazine it reports that in the latest recruitment round for career fire-fighters there were 999 applicants for just 24 positions.</p>
<p>It was a stunning reflection of the respect and admiration that New Zealanders place in this profession. Year after year, fire-fighters are voted as at the top of the list of New Zealand’s most trusted profession.</p>
<p>Meanwhile at the other end of the list, ranked 37th out of 40 - and only just above used car salesmen, sex-workers and telemarketers – comes politicians.</p>
<p>So my mission today, is to convince you that actually politicians are just firefighters by another name.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are many days when I look around the House and the debate can resemble everything from a blazing inferno of political fury through to the smoldering embers of discontent.</p>
<p>The Maori Party walks into this firestorm everyday, seeking to protect the interests and create sites of safety for the people we came to Parliament to represent.</p>
<p>Our &#39;business as usual&#39; is to take the many issues that confront our constituents to Parliament, trying to put out fires and clear a pathway forward.</p>

<p>But our advocacy is more than just about people and opportunities; or as we are inevitably forced to do, the fight for social justice and fundamental human rights.</p>
<p>Our approach is also to promote a value basis which derives from kaupapa Maori, the foundation principles of the Maori world.</p>
<p>As political advocates, we focus our efforts on actions which reflect kaupapa tuku iho – literally the inherited values passed down from our ancestors which provide for the wellbeing of all.</p>
<p>The value basis to our existence is the bedrock on which our party stands. It has often amused me that some people will allege that we are a race-based party. I always want to say, that’s right, Hallelujah! Because in reality our philosophical basis is applicable to the entire human race.</p>
<p>The kaupapa that we live by are derived from Maori worldviews and have universal relevance.</p>
<p>We endeavour to uphold <strong>manaakitanga</strong>; acknowledging the mana of others as having equal or greater importance than our own, through the expression of aroha, hospitality, generosity and mutual respect.</p>
<p>We promote <strong>rangatiratanga</strong> – those attributes of a rangatira which weave the people together – leadership by example, walking the talk, the promotion of selfdetermination</p>
<p>We place priority on <strong>whanaungatanga</strong> –the rights and responsibilities consistent with being part of a collective.</p>
<p>We believe in <strong>kotahitanga</strong> – the principle of unity of purpose and direction.</p>
<p>A fundamental value for us is <strong>wairuatanga</strong> – the knowledge that there is a spiritual presence alongside the physical.</p>
<p>We advocate for the importance of <strong>mana whenua</strong>, the connection which defines Maori by the land as occupied by their ancestors.</p>
<p>The Maori Party promotes the concept of <strong>kaitiakitanga</strong> – the active exercise of responsibility most often expressed in our aspirations for a clean, safe and healthy environment.</p>
<p>We respect our genealogies, our <strong>whakapapa</strong> as the bridge which links us to our ancestors and our heritage.</p>
<p>And in everything we do, we try to accelerate the revival of <strong>te reo Maori.</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to set out in a very simple way, some of the kaupapa and tikanga that drive us in our parliamentary work to let you into the basis of our motivation as a party.</p>
<p>This conference is a forum for generating debate around the concept of service through advocacy.</p>
<p>For us, as politicians of the Maori Party, our service is absolutely linked to our role as advocates not just of the burning policy issues of the day, but also of the philosophical basis of our political movement.</p>
<p>In many ways the how and why of what we do, is just as important as the what and the who.</p>
<p>Let me explain this by referring to three private members bills that I have introduced in my name.</p>
<p>The <strong>HOW</strong> is all around encouraging effective opportunities for people to participate. Our approach as the Maori Party is to encourage people to become involved, to pick up a pen, to send an email, to front up to select committee.</p>
<p>We place high value on a programme of visits within our electorates, kanohi ki te kanohi – face to face, listening and sharing ideas.</p>
<p>Just under a year ago, in Maori Language Week, I introduced a Bill into the House to formalise a significant occurrence within the Maori calendar – the celebration of Matariki – the Maori New Year.</p>
<p>Truth be known, we knew on the day I rose to deliver the opening speech of the debate that the Bill would not proceed, as it did not have sufficient support to secure the votes at the first reading.</p>
<p>But the essential thing for us was to at least enable the debate to occur– to welcome the chance to stand proud, of our distinctly New Zealand cultural identity.</p>
<p>In many ways I think this is one of the greatest aspects of the MMP environment – that a more diverse parliament has brought with it greater opportunities for a more representative debate to be had.</p>
<p>The HOW is also about our respect for the protocols and traditions which have been part of our heritage and passed down over generations.</p>
<p>We have tried very hard, as a collective, to desist from the practice of belittling others or subjecting individuals to personal attack.</p>
<p>Some of the most distressing feedback we receive is to hear the judgments out of the mouths of babes, of children who have witnessed the debating chamber and are bewildered by the levels of animosity expressed in the exchanges between politicians.</p>
<p>The <strong>WHY</strong> behind our advocacy is always influenced by the desire for a better future for the people of Aotearoa, making our nation great again by investing in ourselves.</p>
<p>Indeed, that is the basic premise of Whanau Ora – our flagship policy. Whanau Ora restores to us all that sense of taking responsibility for our own; enabling whanau strengths to come to the fore, placing whanau at the centre. This is whanaungatanga at its most effective.</p>
<p>Let me share with you how our kaupapa influence us in another one of the bills I have on the order paper and that is a proposal to remove the GST off healthy food.</p>
<p>This is, at its barest form, about manaakitanga – ensuring that our most vulnerable, low income communities and particularly children, will be in a better position to afford healthy fruit and vegetables because of the removal of the tax component.</p>
<p>While all consumers would benefit from lower food costs, people on lower incomes tend to spend a greater share of their incomes on food and so would reap a greater benefit as a portion of their income.</p>
<p>So there’s another kaupapa of influence – and that is kaitiakitanga – the effective use of resources in a manner which exercises our responsibility to care for the wellbeing of those around us. For while we’re saving the pennies, we’re also saving lives by promoting healthy eating with food choices such as fresh fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>Kaitiakitanga is also of influence in another bill I am putting forward in terms of 1080 - encouraging us to uphold practices which preserve our flora and fauna.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to refer again to this conference theme, <em>Service through advocacy</em> – with particular regard to my training as a lawyer.</p>
<p>The life of service to, and love of the people, is a commitment that I make willingly as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is also an obligation and a responsibility that I am born into, as a member of whanau, hapu and iwi.</p>
<p>My legal training has provided me with the particular experience and expertise that means I have a literal treasure chest full of different approaches that I believe to be well aligned for my service through advocacy as a Member of Parliament.</p>
<p>And I cannot help think compare it to the highlight of the conference that we are all waiting for, this afternoon, in the trip to the Hobbiton Movie Set.</p>
<p>When construction first started in March 1999 a number of steps were required to transform the area into the land of JRR Tolkien.</p>
<p>- The New Zealand Army was contracted to build 1.5km of road, calling on diggers, bulldozers, loaders, trucks, rollers, graders and other heavy machinery to the site;</p>
<p>- Hedges and trees were brought in and gardens created;</p>
<p>- Thirty-seven hobbit holes were created with untreated timber, ply and polystyrene.</p>
<p>- Artificial leaves were imported from Taiwan and individually wired onto the oak tree overlooking Bag End</p>
<p>- The Mill and double arch bridge were built out of scaffolding, ply and polystyrene, then glued and painted.</p>
<p>- Generators were brought in to run the base camp and filming equipment. Logistics of power, water and sewerage all had to be considered.</p>
<p>And that’s just half of it.</p>
<p>In many ways, it seems to me very similar to the life of a politician.</p>
<p>This week in Parliament, the Local Government (Auckland Law Reform) Bill was passed at the final reading.</p>
<p>The Maori Party was absolutely determined that we would do our best to advocate for the establishment of Maori seats in the new Supercity Auckland Council.</p>
<p>And so we attended hui; we met with iwi; we helped to organise on the hïkoi opposing the legislation; we read all the letters and submissions; we responded to the media; we negotiated with iwi and with the Crown; we tried to negotiate directly with the Ministers concerned; we attended the select committee hearings to encourage Maori participation; we helped draft an alternative in the form of an advisory committee; we presented supplementary amendments to ensure a Treaty clause was included in the Bill; we asked oral questions in the House; we tabled our minority report; we tabled SOPs to try to inject the Maori presence right up until yesterday, and we spoke at every stage of this legislation.</p>
<p>Were we successful in achieving the creation of Maori seats to demonstrate full and effective democratic participation of Maori?</p>
<p>No – but like the construction of Hobbiton, we would let nothing get in the way of the dreams and aspirations of our people for a better day.</p>
<p>That, to me, is my greatest ambition as a politician and as a lawyer– to do the best that I can, to use every tool in the toolbox, to represent the aspirations of the people I am there to serve.</p>
<p>The calling to serve, the commitment I have to our people, requires me to be the very best advocate that I can in every word I speak, in every action I take, in every prayer that I make.</p>
<p>I thank you for this opportunity to share these ideas with you, and wish you all an amazing few days at this Asia Pacific conference of the J Reuben Clark Law Society.</p>
