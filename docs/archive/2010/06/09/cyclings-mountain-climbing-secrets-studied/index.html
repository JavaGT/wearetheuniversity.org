<p>Cycling&#39;s mountain-climbing secrets studied</p>
<p>Research being carried out at Massey University hopes to find out more about how best to climb a mountain on a bicycle – seated or standing.</p>
<p>Dr Philip Fink of the School of Sport and Exercise will use a pair of new, state-of-the-art, $40,000 cycle cranks that have been fitted to a professional quality Avanti road bike to test the forces applied to the pedals during a climb.</p>
<p>“These cranks are able to collect data that will tell us exactly what force is exerted on the pedals,” Dr Fink says. “We’ll link this data to a video image that will give us a precise impression of just how the rider is achieving power.”</p>
<p>Spanish cyclist Alberto Contador is considered one of the best when it comes to climbing, and the image of him standing out of his saddle, charging up the Pyrenees is one of the more famous in the Tour de France in recent years.</p>
<p>But Dr Fink says other riders stay seated when climbing, with almost equal success. “Not a lot is known about the bio-mechanics involved, so we’re looking to pinpoint where the power comes from – whether it be the hip, knee or ankle – at any given time. We will be able calculate whether it is technique, or strength in different muscle groups, which allows a rider to excel.”</p>
<p>Other aspects of riding will also measured, such as what impact the height of the saddle has on power and performance. Riders will be monitored on a treadmill coated with a special ceramic paint that is also used by the United States&#39; National Aeronautics and Space Administration on its space shuttles. “The treadmill is important because it allows the rider to do all of the things he or she usually would on the road,” Dr Fink says. “We want to get as close as we can to normal riding conditions, while still maintaining the type of control we need to collect the information. A stationary bike wouldn’t be able to do this.”</p>
<p>Manufacturer Avanti donated the hi-specification bike to support the research. The set-up makes the school one of only a handful in the world with the ability to carry out this type of research.<br>ends</p>
