<p>**Joyce content to sit on sidelines on Tertiary Education<br>**</p>
<p>Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce revealed his true colours today when he made one of his priorities “dampening demand” on student enrolments, Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Grant Robertson said today.</p>
<p>“Mr Joyce does not see tertiary education as investing in our future, he simply views it as supply and demand,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>“At the moment that means Mr Joyce is slashing the amount of money the Government is giving to the tertiary sector and furiously trying to ‘dampen demand’ for student places in universities and polytechnics.</p>
<p>“It should be a concern to all New Zealand that the Tertiary Education Minister is solely focused on ensuring he can squeeze the funding to the sector.</p>
<p>“Of course tertiary education funding should be spent effectively and efficiently but Steven Joyce is more concerned with ensuring there is less funding and fewer students than creating opportunities and investing in the success of Kiwis.</p>
<p>“The recession has forced many Kiwis to look at upskilling at polytechs and universities, but many of them will be turned away because of the restrictions the Government is enforcing.</p>
<p>“The Minister seems content to sit on the sidelines when it comes to tertiary education. Moving away from the model of university entrance and open entry for those over 20 is a significant change for education in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The Minister should be showing some leadership and work with all providers in the sector to ensure that there are opportunities for all New Zealanders to achieve their potential. It is not good enough for the Minister to hide behind the excuse of institutional autonomy.</p>
<p>“Giving Kiwis more opportunities to upskill, rather than fewer, should be this government’s priority.”</p>
