<p><strong>Uni helping to spread the word about science</strong>  </p>
<p>A Waikato University science symposium looking at ways to spread the word about science takes place on July 8.</p>
<p>Science in the Public is a symposium that aims to find innovative and effective ways of communicating science events to the public through discussions from researchers, workers and organisations working in the field of science.</p>
<p>“The symposium is ideal for anyone who is involved in or has an interest in public science events,” says Faculty of Science and Engineering senior lecturer, Dr Kathrin Otrel-Cass. “There will be plenty of learning and networking opportunities.”</p>
<p>The day-long symposium will be organised in three workshops, beginning with presentations from a range of speakers representing research organisations, tertiary institutions, and media. This will be followed by a trip to Excite at the Waikato Museum, with the final workshop taking place at the university’s Café Scientifique, held at The Bank on Victoria St in Hamilton.</p>
<p>Discussions on the day will cover a range of topics, which include examining how different organisations adapt public science events to social needs; how effective new technologies are at disseminating information; and, how rural communities can access science material to start their own science focused events.</p>
<p>The keynote speaker is Shaun Hendy, a theoretical physicist, who works at Industrial Research Ltd and Victoria University of Wellington. Dr Hendy leads a research team in nanotechnology and materials science, and is currently the Deputy Director of the MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology.</p>
<p>The Science in the Public symposium takes place on Thursday July 8. For more information on this symposium visit <a href="http://www.sci.waikato.ac.nz/cafescientifique/">www.sci.waikato.ac.nz/cafescientifique/</a></p>
