<p><strong>Full range of Massey expertise at National Fieldays</strong></p>
<p>From soils and animal health, farm systems and production methods, to technology-assisted genetic selection, Massey will bring a full range of scientific know-how to this year&#39;s National Fieldays at Mystery Creek, Waikato.</p>
<p>The University is New Zealand&#39;s oldest and largest specialist researcher and teacher of agricultural and horticultural sciences and a world leader in modern understanding of all aspects of the agri-food industries.</p>
<p>After 10 months in operation the University&#39;s computer tomography (CT) scanner, based in the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at the Manawatu campus, has been used on more than 200 sheep, 40 deer, 12 racehorses and numerous dogs, cats and native birds. The scanner, housed in a purpose-built $1.1m facility, is the only one of its type in New Zealand that has an integrated table to allow for scanning of large animals such as horses, whales and cows.</p>
<p>Installed primarily to scan livestock so that those with a propensity to produce leaner meat can be genetically identified, the scanner&#39;s biggest single user to date is state-owned Landcorp Farming, which has put through 200 rams and 40 deer.</p>
<p>But the scanner can also be used to identify injuries and other ailments in horses, native wildlife and companions animals, which Ben Leitch, resident in small animal surgery, will demonstrate at Fieldays.</p>
<p>“As a surgeon, it is vital we have as much information as possible before we begin,” Mr Leitch says. “That’s where the CT is fantastic, because the 3D reconstruction enables us to scan an animal, find out exactly where we need to make our surgical cuts, or, in a complicated case, see exactly where the fractures are.”</p>

<p>Advances in CT resolution mean the scanner is now invaluable in assessing soft tissue structures. Angiograms of the equine distal limb, for example, are providing information previously unavailable through radiography or ultrasound.</p>
<p>Other Massey expertise showcased at Fieldays includes that of members of the Volcanic Risk Solutions team, led by Professor Shane Cronin, who will demonstrate and discuss some of the significant insights the team&#39;s work has for farming on the central North Island. Research shows the Ruapehu eruptions of 1996 spread fertility-promoting elements such as selenium, potassium and sulphur across many farms while others suffered stock losses due to fluoride-filled ash. Professor Cronin documented the event and continues to lead research into the volcanic activity of the central plateau, Taranaki and the Auckland region. The team’s research encompasses the 2007 Ruapehu lahar, which was monitored with an intricate array of sensors.</p>
<p>Other academics with specialist backgrounds who will be on site include:<br>• Professor Jacqueline Rowarth, Director of Massey Agriculture and Professor of Pastoral Agriculture, a leading commentator on the agri-food sector nationally and internationally.<br>• Associate Professor in Animal Science Paul Kenyon, whose expertise covers pastoral livestock and dairy systems.<br>• Dr Jean Margerison, a senior lecturer in the Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health, who specialises in animal nutrition and lactation physiology.</p>
<p>The University&#39;s Vice-Chancellor, Steve Maharey, will also be at Fieldays, while College of Sciences Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Robert Anderson will host a function for Massey alumni and supporters on Thursday evening from 5pm-7pm in the ASB Marquee. Guest speaker will be Mark Jeffries, who leads the University&#39;s agri-food strategy.</p>
