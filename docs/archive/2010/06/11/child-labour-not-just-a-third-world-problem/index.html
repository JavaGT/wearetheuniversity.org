<p><strong>Child labour not just a third world problem</strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand youth union movement Stand Up believes more needs to be done to address issues around child labour in New Zealand and around the world. This Saturday June 12 marks the ILO&#39;s World Day Against Child Labour.</p>
<p>“Millions of children around the world are working in unacceptable conditions,” said Stand Up convenor James Sleep. “The World Day Against Child Labour gives visibility to this important issue, and further momentum to efforts aimed at eradicating various forms of child labour.”</p>
<p>Sleep added that while children in New Zealand are not subjected to the same level of violations as children in third world countries, there are thousands of young people under 16 across New Zealand working in relatively poor conditions and earning low wages.</p>
<p>“We must ask the question: why do many young people work? Research from The Public Health Advisory Committee (PHAC), last week told us that New Zealand is a great place for children of parents who have a high income. However, it is a dramatically different story for children whose parents do not. It is these children we are concerned about,” said Sleep.</p>
<p>Sleep said the effects from the recession have put increasing pressures on many low income families, and for many young people this has meant a shift in focus from working for pocket money, to working to help support their families. This expectation for young people to work puts them in a difficult dilemma and puts extra pressure on their participation in education.</p>
<p>“The anecdotal evidence of young people being exploited by New Zealand employers is saddening. These include cases of young people being paid as little as $1 per hour delivering papers and circulars, through to young people in supermarkets being paid as little as $4.50, when a colleague a few months older could be on triple the amount, because of their age. This is shameful and simply not the fair Kiwi way.”</p>
<p>On this World Day against child labour Stand Up backs the call for more of the right kind of investment in young people.</p>
<p>“It is appalling that many young people formally engaged in the labour market are not treated with dignity. The Government and employers must recognise this and end the exploitation of young workers.”</p>
