<p><strong>Wednesday, 11 August 2010, 3:37 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>National Still Victimising Sexual Abuse Victims</strong></p>
<p>The National Government’s decision to partially back down on a failed cost cutting programme that denied sexual abuse survivors access to counselling doesn’t go far enough, Labour Victims Rights spokesperson Lynne Pillay says.</p>
<p>“The entire failed experiment of denying sexual abuse victims counselling needs to be scrapped immediately. There is simply no justification for this ridiculously cruel cost cutting exercise to continue,” Lynne Pillay said.</p>
<p>“Since National introduced this scheme thousands of sexual abuse survivors have been denied counselling causing an outcry from professional counsellors and victims themselves.</p>
<p>“Up to 90 percent of claims for sexual abuse counselling have been either declined or put into a holding pattern since October last year.</p>
<p>“In April this year just under 180 people who applied to ACC for sexual abuse counselling were accepted while another 1500 were either declined or put into a holding pattern.</p>
<p>“It is simply not good enough and for ACC and the National Government, to take nearly a year after beginning a review to acknowledge a problem that has been apparent for quite some time.</p>
<p>“National says it’s looking for value for money. Well quite honestly taxpayers have certainly not received any value for the $120,000 the review has so far cost, if this belated partial back down is the best the Government can come up with.</p>
<p>“National launched a review of their failed policy in October last year and today’s partial back down will be too little too late to help sexual abuse survivors, given it only applies to new applicants or those waiting for decisions.</p>

<p>“I am also appalled that the review panel has said they raised concerns with the Minister of ACC Nick Smith six weeks ago that too many sexual abuse survivors were being denied assistance.</p>
<p>“Why did Government not act then rather than prolonging the problem?</p>
<p>“I am still concerned that the Minister is allowing sexual abuse survivors to suffer while he fudges the truth to suit himself.</p>
<p>“Sexual abuse victims and survivors deserve better than today’s pathetic partial back down,” Lynne Pillay said.</p>
