<p>**National Shows Contempt For Local Input On Offshore Drilling Issue<br>**</p>
<p>Environment Minister Nick Smith&#39;s call for local government to be stripped of the power to regulate offshore oil and gas operations is part of National&#39;s agenda to promote open season for offshore exploration, and shows its contempt for local democracy, Labour says.</p>
<p>Environment spokesperson Charles Chauvel and Energy spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta were commenting on Dr Smith&#39;s proposal that the Environmental Protection Authority, whose board he will appoint, be given these powers at the expense of local authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;This Minister abolished the democratically-elected Canterbury Regional Council in order to promote National&#39;s plans for much bigger and more intensive dairying by making it easier for big farms to be given water,” Charles Chauvel said.</p>
<p>“Now, he wants to promote National&#39;s plans for more offshore minerals exploration by taking the power to regulate that activity away from democratically-elected local councils, and giving it to a body whose directors he will hand-pick.</p>
<p>&quot;Territorial local authorities are best-placed to consult with locals about local needs and priorities.<br>&quot;Labour agrees with Taranaki District Council resource management director Fred McLay that this activity has been carried out successfully at a local level for many years, and if anything, local powers should be increased, not stripped away.&quot;</p>
<p>Energy spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta said Labour is concerned that National intends to allow offshore drilling to occur without proper consultation with community and iwi groups.</p>

<p>“The Government needs to ensure that all parties have an opportunity to be involved in any offshore drilling applications. Communities have a right to have a say on what happens in their region,” Nanaia Mahuta said.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour opposes offshore drilling without adequate safeguards for local environments and local communities, and a guarantee that a fair share of profits from any extraction that ultimately occurs will stay onshore,” Charles Chauvel said</p>
<p>“Nick Smith&#39;s proposal will weaken the ability to deliver safeguards, and should be abandoned.”</p>
