<p>Annette King<br><strong>Social Development Spokesperson</strong></p>
<p><strong>Paula Bennett hiding bad unemployment news</strong><br>Employment Minister Paula Bennett has been trying to bury bad unemployment data – a sure sign her government has run out of ideas on how to grow jobs or support existing jobs, Labour’s social development spokesperson Annette King said today.</p>
<p>“This week, Ms Bennett finally gave the Ministry of Social Development permission to release the full benefit statistics for July – 18 days after her low key August 6 press statement on unemployment figures, released on a Friday afternoon,” Annette King said.</p>
<p>“The report is still not public on the MSD Website. It is available only on request at the Parliamentary Library.</p>
<p>“Withholding regular benefit information for as long as possible is starting to become a pattern for Ms Bennett,” Annette King said.</p>
<p>“It is surely no coincidence that the jobless figures have got worse again.</p>
<p>“The latest benefit statistics show that between July 2009 and July 2010:</p>
<p>The number of people on a main benefit has gone up by 18,000<br>Numbers on unemployment benefit are up by 6800<br>Emergency benefits up by 22.8 per cent.<br>Independent youth benefits up by 29.6 per cent<br>Student hardship benefits up 84.8 per cent</p>
<p>“It is clear Ms Bennett is trying to hide bad news from the public.</p>
<p>“She was also slow to release the full figures for June. There was a gap of 16 days between her muted press statement on July 14 and her permission for the full summary to go to the Parliamentary Library on July 30.</p>

<p>“This is in stark contrast with her speedier response with the March, April and May figures – when the Government was busy telling New Zealanders that a strong recovery was underway and unemployment was dropping.</p>
<p>“For those three months, the delay between her statement and the full release was one day, one day and two days respectively.</p>
<p>“Try as National might, no amount of trickery can hide the damage its policies are wreaking on people’s lives,” Annette King said.</p>
<p>“Gimmicks like the Job Summit and cycleway were a flop, and John Key’s bright idea for a financial services hub has disappeared without trace. The jobs aren’t appearing.</p>
<p>“In almost two years in office, it is obvious that this government has run out of ideas. National is just not working,” Annette King said</p>
