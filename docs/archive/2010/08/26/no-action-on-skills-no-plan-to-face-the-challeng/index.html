<p><strong>Thursday, 26 August 2010, 12:47 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>No action on skills – no plan to face the challenge</strong><br>The astounding lack of commitment to lifting the skills of the workforce by Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson is further evidence of a Government without a plan to lift our economic performance says Labour’s Associate Labour spokesperson Carol Beaumont.</p>
<p>“Despite ‘launching’ a Skills Forum in October last year, the Government has no plan to build the skills of the workforce, something identified as one of the biggest long term challenges facing our labour market and economy.</p>
<p>“It is widely understood by all but this National Government that increasing skills is essential to improving productivity and closing the wage gap with Australia.</p>
<p>“There have been no meetings of the Skills Forum (a high powered group of union, business, industry training, tertiary sector and Government representatives) in 2010 despite plans to schedule five meetings of this group. Furthermore there is no new money for workforce skills and training initiatives and no comprehensive plan for skills development and workforce training.</p>
<p>“This lack of action flies in the face of what is needed given significant skill shortages, high unemployment and the need to move our workplaces and our industries to a more sustainable future. New Zealand is out of step with most OECD countries,” Carol Beaumont said.</p>
<p>“Investing in skills development has multiple benefits – benefits to individuals, to families, to communities, to workplaces and industries and to our economy. It is a no brainer but clearly beyond the comprehension of the National Government.”</p>
