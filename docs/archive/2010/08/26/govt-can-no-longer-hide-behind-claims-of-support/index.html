<p>26th August 2010<br>For Immediate Release</p>
<p><strong>Government Can No Longer Hide Behind Claims of Widespread Support for National Standards</strong></p>
<p>It’s clear the Education Minister can no longer claim widespread support for National Standards from parents and school boards, says the education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa.</p>
<p>Letters from 51 Boards of Trustees to Anne Tolley about National Standards have been released under the Official Information Act. An overwhelming 96% of them express serious concern and opposition to National Standards.</p>
<p>The Minister continues to say that she receives hundreds of letters of support about National Standards and that the implementation process is going “really really well”.</p>
<p>NZEI President Frances Nelson says boards, parents, principals, teachers and communities know that’s not true.</p>
<p>One thousand school communities, including hundreds of school trustees signed school community statements earlier this year, expressing their concern about the Standards and calling for a trial.</p>
<p>An NZEI survey of more than 700 principals in June showed that 94% had serious reservations about National Standards and their implementation. Recently principals around the country took a vote of no confidence in the Standards, with many regional associations boycotting any further training.</p>
<p>“The more people see of this flawed policy the more they realise National Standards will do nothing to raise student achievement and resistance to them is growing in schools and communities,” says Frances Nelson.</p>
<p>“The release of these letters highlights that the level of support from those having to try and work with National Standards – teachers, principals and trustees – just isn’t high enough.”</p>
<p>“The sector has shown a willingness to work through the issues and bring positive changes to teaching and learning. The question is how bad does it have to get before the government agrees to listen?” says Ms Nelson.</p>
