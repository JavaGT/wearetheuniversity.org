<p>**$40,000 Student Flat Giveaway<br>**five students live rent free for a year  </p>
<p>Tomorrow, five lucky University of Canterbury students will win a free five bedroom apartment for a year at Ilam Apartments part of UC Accommodation Student Village.</p>
<p>The fillaflat competition <a href="http://www.fillaflat.co.nz/">http://www.fillaflat.co.nz/</a> puts students in the draw to live on campus in independent, modern, self-catered apartment living.</p>
<p>“At Ilam Apartments students get all the benefits of a quality flat while still being in the centre of student life”, said Darel Hall General Manager of UC Accommodation Student Village.</p>
<p>“All students have to do to win is pop down to Ilam Apartments, have a look at the apartment, and get a ‘key’ to go into the draw to win $40,000 worth of good living”, he said.</p>
<p>The competition closes tomorrow, Thursday 19 August at 5pm.  </p>
<p>“Ilam Apartments is for students in any year of study, unlike most Halls of Residence that focus on first years”, said Darel Hall. “While a good number are first years, half are in the 20 – 23 year age group combining good academic results with a very fine social life”.</p>
<p>The Ilam Apartments are located on Homestead Lane, on campus. The apartments provide students with independence without the stress and hassle of dealing with unreliable flatmates or long term leases. “We’ve recently compared our prices with those of flatting privately and the figures show us that living at Ilam Apartments is the same even before the academic and social benefits are considered” commented Darel Hall. “Students need to get down to Ilam Apartments a.s.a.p. to take this $40,000 prize off our hands”, said Darel Hall</p>
<p>Ilam Apartments are managed by UC Accommodation Student Village which also manages Univeristy Hall and Sonoda Christchurch Campus Halls of Residence at the University of Canterbury.</p>
