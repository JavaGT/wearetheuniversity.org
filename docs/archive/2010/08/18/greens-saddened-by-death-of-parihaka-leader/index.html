<p><strong>Greens saddened by death of Parihaka leader</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party expressed sadness at the sudden passing of Te Miringa Hohaia yesterday.</p>
<p>“This is a tragic loss for the people of Taranaki and for the whole country,” Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said.</p>
<p>“Te Miringa Hohaia was a true leader of his people, a staunch advocate for their Treaty of Waitangi claims, and a guardian of their waiata and traditions. His work for the Parihaka community was an inspiration to many.</p>
<p>“By spearheading the Parihaka Peace Festival and the Art of Passive Resistance exhibition, he helped to share the story of Parihaka with thousands of New Zealanders and to keep this important history alive.</p>
<p>“At all times he was guided and motivated by a strong commitment to social justice and doing the best for his people.</p>
<p>“He will be greatly missed by many, and our thoughts are particularly with his whanau, hapu and iwi today,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
