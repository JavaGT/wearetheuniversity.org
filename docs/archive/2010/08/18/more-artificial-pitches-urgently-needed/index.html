<p><strong>Wednesday, 18 August 2010, 4:02 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>More artificial pitches urgently needed</strong>  </p>
<p>Labour&#39;s Lambton Ward candidate Marcus Ganley today welcomed support for his call for more artificial sports fields in Wellington.</p>
<p>&quot;Every weekend football games across Wellington are cancelled due to grass pitches turning into swamp. This has meant hundreds of games cancelled and the games that do go ahead have been played on sub-standard fields,&quot; Marcus Ganley said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is holding back the development of our city&#39;s future sports stars as well as disrupting the plans for many Wellington families.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an issue that needs to be addressed urgently. The Wellington City Council has previously rejected bringing forward funding to speed up the building of more artificial pitches.</p>
<p>&quot;The Council needs to show some leadership on this issue and direct funding to pitches that will be used by tens of thousands of Wellingtonians, rather than spending our rates on overseas trips or World Cup statues,&quot; Marcus Ganley said.</p>
<p>&quot;I welcome the support of another Lambton Ward candidate on this issue. For us to get the fields we need, we will need everyone pulling in the same direction.&quot;</p>
