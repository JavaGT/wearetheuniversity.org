<p><strong>Wednesday, 18 August 2010, 1:38 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Award winning Te Uku wind farm first of its kind</strong></p>
<p>Labour’s Energy Spokesperson and MP for Hauraki Waikato Nanaia Mahuta congratulated Meridian Energy on winning Environment Waikato’s inaugural earthworks Site of the Year award.</p>
<p>“The award was designed to highlight and promote high quality environmentally sensitive earthworks projects. Meridian’s high standard of erosion and sediment controls at its 28 turbine Te Uku wind farm near Raglan was what gave them the edge at this year’s awards.</p>
<p>The Te Uku wind farm is being built by Meridian Energy and local Waikato electricity distribution company, WEL Networks.</p>
<p>The unique partnership between a gentailer and a lines company makes the Te Uku wind farm the first generation development of its type in New Zealand. Upon completion, the 28 turbines are said to be able to generate 64.4MWs of electricity, enough to power around 30,000 average homes.</p>
<p>“This award is an example of Meridian&#39;s environmentally sustainable policies put into practice and I would like to congratulate all who were involved in developing this award winning wind farm,” Nanaia Mahuta said</p>
