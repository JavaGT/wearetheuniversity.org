<h3>UC Advocates Preserving Opportunities While Focusing On Outcomes</h3>
<p>The University of Canterbury has written to all secondary school principals and MPs to seek their views on enrolment policies and practices for domestic students, and outline its progression standards that make it harder for non-performing students to continue studying at the University.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says the University wants to encourage informed discussion on the long-term future of New Zealand&#39;s tertiary sector, which is grappling with an unplanned and unfunded rise in student enrolments.</p>
<p>In the letter Dr Carr says UC does not intend to adopt the approach of some other universities which are seeking to address the problem by setting their own admission standards for domestic students and limiting entry not only to specified courses and programmes but their institutions as a whole.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic enrolments respond to fluctuations in external factors over which we have no control - economic pressures, changes in the job-market, demands for graduates, the changing demographics of school leavers etc. To a large extent we are at the mercy of &#39;the market&#39;. The straightforward approach is to restrict entry, but we have resisted this for the time being.&quot;</p>
<p>He says UC is committed to equity and access and, for as long as possible, wishes to retain open entry for students who are qualified to take advantage of university study. He also says it is potentially confusing for prospective students if each university insists on having its own admission criteria in preference to operating in accordance with national standards.</p>
<p>However, UC&#39;s enrolment of domestic students is done so on the basis that they make the most of their opportunity to study at university - which means doing the work and passing their exams.</p>
<p>&quot;Our message to students is this: &#39;If you have the opportunity to study at university - give it your best shot; but be under no illusion, you must perform to retain a place - outcomes matter&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>Since mid-2009 the University of Canterbury has applied a &quot;firm but fair&quot; academic progression policy that makes it harder for non-performing students to continue studying at UC.</p>
<p>&quot;This recognises that limited taxpayer support should be directed to those who are able to take advantage of a university opportunity. We also know that a world-class learning environment requires talented students along with innovative and inspirational teachers, quality research, well-designed programmes and appropriate facilities,&quot; says Dr Carr.</p>
<p>When a student&#39;s results are such that they come under review, they are given a warning and offered support in their study effort. If a student has not made sufficient academic progress by the time of the next review, they are excluded from a Faculty, preventing them from continuing to study in the same qualification.</p>
<p>Exclusion from UC applies if a student has continued study (in areas not already subject to exclusion) and, by the time of the next review round, has not made sufficient academic progress. This exclusion prevents the student from continuing to study at the University of Canterbury. The reviews are conducted at mid-year and at the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;While we continue to apply open entry criteria UC may enrol slightly more domestic students on the basis that we would like to give them a go. We are nevertheless strongly committed to enforcing standards, therefore as an institution may see a greater number of students fail to complete their qualification. The key is to ensure that this assessment occurs within the first six months, rather than potentially wasting staff and students&#39; time and taxpayer funds over a longer period.</p>
<p>&quot;UC believes supporting those who are capable and can demonstrate that they are making the most of the opportunity to study at university is the best use of New Zealand&#39;s limited education resources.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Carr says excess domestic student enrolments at UC in 2010 are approaching the Tertiary Education Commission&#39;s tolerance level.</p>
<p>&quot;What this means, is that UC is not receiving government funding for all of the domestic students it is teaching. This is not a sustainable position. The fees students pay (usually by borrowing from the Government), cover only about 30 percent of the full cost of tuition.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Carr says the University is introducing an application to enrol close-off date of 10 December 2010 for domestic undergraduate students intending to enrol for the first time in 2011. The close-off date is similar to what is already in place at a number of other New Zealand universities, and is being introduced to help manage enrolment numbers and processes more efficiently and smoothly. It will not apply for application into teacher education programmes as there are existing student selection processes for entry into these qualifications.</p>
