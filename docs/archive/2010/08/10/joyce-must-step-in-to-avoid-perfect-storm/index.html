<p>10 August 2010 <strong>Media Statement</strong></p>
<p><strong>Joyce must step in to avoid perfect storm</strong></p>
<p>With new unemployment figures showing nearly 160,000 New Zealanders out of work, Steven Joyce needs to come off the sideline and support Universities and Polytechnics so those New Zealanders are not just left to languish in an unemployment queue, Labour Tertiary Education spokesperson Grant Robertson said today.</p>
<p>“Those who are out of work and are looking to upskill or retrain will find that the doors are shut at most universities and many polytechnics because of enrolment caps and underfunding. This is the worst of all worlds for the people involved and for New Zealand. It is time this Government stepped in to give these people the opportunity to gain new and improved skills that will give them a chance to achieve their potential.</p>
<p>“In response to the Welfare Working group, John Key getting people off welfare was a priority.</p>
<p>“Where does John Key expect these people to go? The 115 people that lined up for 20 jobs at a Nelson KFC is just one example to show that there aren’t enough jobs to go around.</p>
<p>“Adult and Community education courses had their funding stripped from them – so that’s not an option for most. Universities have had to shut their doors to new enrolments, and polytechnics are facing a $70 million cut to funding. Where else are these New Zealanders supposed to go?</p>

<p>“This is becoming a perfect storm. High unemployment, limited educational opportunities, limited job prospects – with over 40,000 of those affected under the age of 25, our future workforce is in a dire state.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce needs to stop sitting on his hands, support more opportunities for learning and training and start investing in the future of New Zealand and New Zealanders,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
