<p><strong>Tuesday, 10 August 2010, 12:22 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Phil Goff<br><strong>Leader of the Labour Party</strong><br>Luamanuvao Winnie Laban<br><strong>MP for Mana</strong><br>10 August 2010 <strong>Media Statement</strong><br><strong>Luamanuvao Winnie Laban to stand down</strong></p>
<p>Labour MP for Mana Luamanuvao Winnie Laban has today announced she is to leave Parliament to take up the role of Assistant Vice Chancellor Pasifika at Victoria University.</p>
<p>Labour Leader Phil Goff said it is with mixed emotions that he farewelled Winnie Laban from the Labour caucus.</p>
<p>“Winnie has made a significant contribution to Pasifika and this is a new opportunity for her as a Labour member to continue to work to raise Pasifika aspirations and achievements,” Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>“We are delighted she has been appointed to the position and she remains a strong supporter of the Labour Party.”</p>
<p>Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said it has been an enormous privilege to serve as Labour MP for the people of Mana over the last three elections.</p>
<p>“I have worked out that it’s time for me to step away from Parliament now. This career move is an exciting one and I am very privileged and honoured to be able to be the MP for Mana and I am very proud of my Party,” Winnie Laban said.</p>
<p>“This enables me to continue my passion for Pacific people, young people and more importantly having a role in education outcomes that will lead to stronger economic development for the Pacific community.</p>
<p>“I have enormous affection for my electorate. I have loved every opportunity to be able serve the people of Mana and I am very confident that Labour will find an exciting candidate who will win that seat. It has always been a strong Labour seat and I am confident it will remain that way.”</p>

<p>Phil Goff said Labour is sorry to see Winnie Laban go, and her departure will mean a by-election later this year.</p>
<p>“Labour will be looking to find a strong candidate and will campaign on both local issues and issues that matter to all Kiwis,” Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>“At a time when prices increases are moving faster than wages and employment opportunities are scarce, Labour will focus on building a stronger economy that works for Kiwis. Labour will be throwing the weight of its organisation behind keeping Mana Labour.</p>
<p>“We wish Winnie well for her exciting new career and we look forward to the campaign in Mana.”</p>
