<p><strong>Tuesday, 24 August 2010, 2:26 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>**Lincoln University and Telford Rural Polytechnic merger proposal for public consultation<br>**<br>Public feedback is being sought on a proposal by Lincoln University and Telford Rural Polytechnic to merge.</p>
<p>The Minister for Tertiary Education, Steven Joyce, has put the proposal out today, with submissions invited until September 17.</p>
<p>The merger proposal supports directions signalled by the Councils of Lincoln University and Telford Rural Polytechnic to develop a model of strong collaboration in education to support land based industries. The Councils believe the merger is in line with two governmental intentions; to drive productivity growth and investment in the export sector and to give young people wider choices in education.</p>
<p>The model is one of vertical integration to encompass all aspects of the agricultural and land-based sector provision and supply chain, from secondary school, sub-degree teaching to post-doctoral research, commercialisation and extension activities with industry.</p>
<p>The merger between Lincoln University and Telford Rural Polytechnic will complement existing partnerships the University already has in place. Lincoln University will continue to enhance its Partnership for Excellence relationship with Massey University and relevant industry partners, develop its partnership with AgResearch Ltd and develop its relationship with Ngai Tahu</p>
<p>Telford Rural Polytechnic will also continue to enhance its relationships with other providers and industry partners.</p>

<p>A merger of Lincoln University and Telford Rural Polytechnic will support the intent of the Tertiary Education Strategy 2010-15 and build on the Review of Land-based Provision conducted by the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC).</p>
<p>The overall focus is on national needs and ensuring ongoing support for land-based industries, from working on the land to internationally accredited research. The major drivers for these initiatives are the development of enhanced technology transfer and innovation through formal qualifications, professional development opportunities and improved industry access to current research.</p>
<p>A consultation document has been prepared summarising the key features and benefits of the proposed merger.
