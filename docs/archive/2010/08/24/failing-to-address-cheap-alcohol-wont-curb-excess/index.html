<p><strong>Failing to address easy access to cheap alcohol will fail to curb drinking excesses</strong></p>
<p>The government&#39;s failure to stop retailers selling cheap alcohol at rock bottom prices is standing in the way of genuine alcohol law reform, Labour&#39;s Justice spokesperson, Lianne Dalziel said today.</p>
<p>“The Cabinet paper reveals the fundamental flaw which undermines the packages of reforms announced yesterday, when it states that the proposals &#39;target those who drink excessively, particularly at licensed premises and in the public domain&#39;,&quot; Lianne Dalziel said.</p>
<p>&quot;The trouble with this analysis is that most alcohol (around 70%) is consumed away from licensed premises and there is no evidence to support the view that most of this drinking is occurring in public places. That is where the drinking is visible, but given the total quantity consumed pales into insignificance against the amount being consumed in private homes.&quot;</p>
<p>Lianne Dalziel said that the Minister had failed to understand the culture of &quot;pre-loading&quot;, which sees significant quantities of cheap alcohol consumed at home before this generation of young adults head into town, where they tend to drink to top up.</p>
<p>“The police will tell you that these young adults are already intoxicated or close to intoxication when they arrive in town&quot;.</p>
<p>Lianne Dalziel said she attend a Healthy Christchurch briefing recently, where they presented the results of a survey which showed that people had consumed an average of ten standard drinks before they came into town.</p>

<p>&quot;These 20-somethings are the most price-sensitive people of all - if wine is $5.00 per bottle they will buy four bottles instead of two bottles. And even with the standardising of the alcohol &amp; standard drink size of RTDs, when a bottle or can is cheaper than a bottle of soft drink or milk, then it doesn&#39;t take long for them to do the maths.</p>
<p>&quot;Bringing in minimum prices will not affect those people who like to buy a nice bottle of wine to go with a meal - it will reduce the amount of cheap alcohol these young people can afford to buy for pre-loading.&quot;</p>
<p>Lianne Dalziel said that the Cabinet Paper reveals concerns of the Ministry of Health &amp; Ministry of Youth Affairs about the failure to address pricing policies.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition the Police were ignored by the government with respect to the decisions on trading hours, as they identified that a 4am closing time would not impact on the peak &#39;alcohol-related&#39; offending time of 3am&quot;.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is that this package does not meet the demands of the communities that are bearing the brunt of the harm caused by alcohol and will be very disappointing to the thousands of New Zealanders who expected the Government to be more proactive in tackling this issue.</p>
