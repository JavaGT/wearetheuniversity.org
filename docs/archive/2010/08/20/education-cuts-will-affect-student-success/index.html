<p><strong>Friday, 20 August 2010, 3:56 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>**Education cuts will affect student success<br>**</p>
<p>Ministry of Education staff were told today that one hundred positions will be cut, further risking the quality of education available to New Zealanders, Labour’s State Services spokesperson Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>One hundred jobs are planned to be cut from the Ministry before June 2011.<br>“Where will these cuts, on top of the three hundred currently unfilled positions at the Ministry of Education, come from?” Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>“This government made a clear promise at the election to cap public service jobs, not to cut them. This is yet another in a long line of cuts that will affect services Kiwis expect from the government.</p>
<p>“There is no plan for where these jobs will be cut from, or how added workloads for remaining staff will be managed.<br>“While I understand that in the current economic climate it may be necessary for the government find efficiencies within our state sector, we need to ensure that Kiwis continue to receive a high standard of public services,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>“It won’t be long before the number of staff being cut from Ministry of Education will be reflected in student achievement.</p>
