<p><strong>Summer research opportunities at UC</strong>  </p>
<p>The University of Canterbury is offering scholarships worth more than $750,000 to give students an opportunity to spend their summer vacation undertaking supervised research projects.</p>
<p>Students can select from a diverse range of projects such as the health and safety of female sex workers, the ethnic makeup of New Zealand rugby, using a mobile phone to interact with a home health care system, safety in school laboratories, and mapping snow and ice in Antarctica.</p>
<p>The Dean of Postgraduate Research, Professor Lucy Johnston, said approximately 150 scholarships were on offer for the summer of 2010/2011, each valued at $5000. Students will spend ten weeks on the projects.</p>
<p>“The scholarships provide students with hands-on experience in exciting cutting-edge research projects,” said Professor Johnston.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re inviting students to have a look at the research projects on the website, and if they find something that interests them they should apply for a scholarship.”</p>
<p>Scholarships are available in each of the University’s colleges (Arts, Business &amp; Economics, Education, Engineering and Science), the School of Law, and University research institutes and centres (Biomolecular Interaction Centre; New Zealand Institute of Language, Brain and Behaviour; Human Interface Technology Laboratory; Waterways Centre for Freshwater Management; and the Van der Veer Institute for Parkinson’s and Brain Research).<br>In addition there are 23 projects jointly funded with external partners – Canterbury Rugby Football Union, GNS Science, Industrial Research Limited, Landcare; Science Alive, Syft Technologies, and Tait Electronics.</p>
