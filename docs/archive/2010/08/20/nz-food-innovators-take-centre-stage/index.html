<p><strong>NZ food innovators take centre stage</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand’s most innovative food products will be easily identifiable in the future, with the introduction of the new Food Awards mark.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Food Awards will be presented at a gala dinner in Auckland on October 28.</p>
<p>The awards themselves are being named &quot;the Masseys&quot; to reflect the University&#39;s support of the competition and its longstanding involvement in New Zealand food technology teaching, research and innovation.</p>
<p>The Food Awards mark is a consumer-focused initiative, available to category winners to differentiate their products on shelves as being of nationally-recognised quality.</p>
<p>The awards are a celebration of innovation in food, offering consumers a clear indication of food excellence and the industry&#39;s new benchmarks and leadership, says University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey.</p>
<p>&quot;Massey University has been supporting the New Zealand food and beverage industry for more than 80 years,&quot; Mr Maharey says. &quot;We have a commitment to provide innovative responses and solutions across the value chain. This year, we’ve refreshed the awards to place a greater emphasis in three key areas – products, operations and enterprise.&quot;</p>
<p>There is no limit to the number of entries – products simply need to be manufactured in New Zealand and be available in retail outlets – and the process has been streamlined and simplified to enable an online entry to be completed in about 20 minutes or less. These close on August 31.</p>
<p>At the awards dinner category finalists will be showcased and winners will be announced, including those in special categories and the supreme winner.</p>
<p>Sponsorship of the awards is also open, with sponsors able to align with the awards’ objectives of excellence and innovation, as well as taking an industry leadership role.</p>
