<p>**Ryall should walk in the front door<br>**</p>
<p>Health Minister Tony Ryall should walk in the front door of hospitals and introduce himself if he really wants to know what is going on in District Health Boards, Labour Deputy Leader Annette King says.</p>
<p>Mrs King said Tony Ryall’s claims that she ‘had not left her ivory tower’ were totally ridiculous.</p>
<p>“As Health Minister I visited every DHB and spoke with both patients and clinicians and as a result I received extremely valuable information about the running of our hospitals and I always introduced myself and went in the front door.</p>
<p>“While Mr Ryall says he is learning valuable information, by sneaking into hospitals, I wonder if he was taken the time to speak with home support clients who have lost their services, or neurosurgery patients and clinicians in Dunedin and Southland who face losing their services.</p>
<p>“If Mr Ryall was really interested in how the health system was running he would take the time to visit some of the thousands of patients who have missed out on health services thanks to the more than 100 health cuts he has made.</p>
<p>“The fact is Tony Ryall’s behaviour was last night described by one clinician as ‘creepy and weird’. But this isn’t the first time Mr Ryall has displayed creepy and weird behaviour.</p>
<p>“I have been told by DHB staff that Mr Ryall and his advisor Peter McCardle, who staff now refer to as ‘Minister McCardle’, feel free to ring mangers and clinical staff at all levels of the organisation day and night.</p>
<p>“The question has to be asked if Tony Ryall can take the time to sit in Emergency Departments, then he should be able make the time to visit those who have lost health services under his watch as well,” Annette King said.</p>
