<p><strong>UC biochemist named one of NZ’s top tertiary teachers</strong></p>
<p>University of Canterbury biochemist Associate Professor Emily Parker has been recognised as one of New Zealand’s top tertiary teachers.</p>
<p>Professor Parker (Chemistry) was one of 11 teachers awarded a national Tertiary Teaching Excellence Award during a ceremony held at Parliament last night.</p>
<p>The awards, administered by New Zealand&#39;s National Centre for Tertiary Teaching Excellence Ako Aotearoa, recognise and encourage excellence in tertiary teaching. The award includes $20,000 in prize money to be used for career development and promote best practice.</p>
<p>Professor Parker, who earlier this year received a University of Canterbury Teaching Award, has taught chemistry at UC since 2006. She is a principal investigator in UC’s Biomolecular Interaction Centre.</p>
<p>Professor Parker said she felt very honoured to receive the award.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very grateful to my colleagues for so generously sharing their teaching practices and their enthusiasm for tertiary teaching.</p>
<p>&quot;I owe an enormous amount to my research students. Together we share a fascination for the study of enzyme-catalysed reactions. It is sharing ideas and research directions with them, that constantly reinvigorates my passion for my subject, and allows my teaching to be truly research led.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Parker has a BSc (Hons) degree in organic chemistry from UC and a PhD in bio-organic chemistry from the University of Cambridge, UK.</p>
<p>Professor Parker’s nomination for the award noted her “passion for the exquisite detail of the world of atoms, molecules and chemical transformations” and how she shares her excitement with students “by providing this world with meaning, context and relevance”.</p>

<p>“She brings her own research into the classroom to illustrate the excitement of new knowledge and to open a window to an exciting world beyond the undergraduate degree. She stimulates students to feel comfortable asking questions and to grow in independence.”</p>
<p>Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Education) Professor Gail Gillon, who represented UC at the awards ceremony, said Professor Parker was a “very deserving winner”.</p>
<p>“Emily is an amazing role model to inspire others at UC as a leading female academic in chemistry who excels in both research and teaching. She gave a very passionate acceptance speech which left the audience in no doubt as to why she is so successful in engaging students in learning.”</p>
