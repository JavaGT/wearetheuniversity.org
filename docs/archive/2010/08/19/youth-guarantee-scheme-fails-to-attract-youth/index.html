<p>**Youth Guarantee scheme fails to attract youth<br>**</p>
<p>Figures released yesterday by Minister for Education Anne Tolley show that the Youth Guarantee scheme is failing to attract students, with 466 places unfilled, Labour associate spokesperson for Tertiary Education Carmel Sepuloni said.</p>
<p>“The Youth Guarantee scheme was aimed at getting disengaged youth back into education. We can see from these figures that this goal is far from being achieved – in Auckland alone, over 200 places remain unfilled.</p>
<p>“This is not a sign that young people don’t want the chance to advance their education. Rather, it is a reflection on the lack of planning that went into this scheme.</p>
<p>“Students enrolled under the Youth Guarantee scheme are not obliged to pay fees. They are not eligible, however, to receive student loans or any transport assistance. Without this financial assistance, many young people who would be eligible for the Youth Guarantee scheme simply cannot afford to study,” Carmel Sepuloni said.</p>
<p>“I hope that these figures prompt the Minister for Education to acknowledge that this scheme is not working as intended, and look for further ways to help disengaged sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds into further education or training.”</p>
