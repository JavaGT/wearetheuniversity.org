<p><strong>Top Google man: Why we need nerds in a crisis</strong></p>
<p>The earthquakes this year in Haiti, Chile and China, and man-made disasters like the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico are prime examples of disasters that exact a terrible toll on people around the world.</p>
<p>In all these cases, new technology has played a key role in saving lives and reducing misery. New approaches to disaster response are currently under development by several organisations, including Google.</p>
<p>Google’s New York-based engineering director and University of Waikato alumnus, Dr Craig Nevill-Manning, will give a public lecture during a visit to the University on August 26 on how these new systems are being used on the ground in disaster areas.</p>
<p>He says in the last decade, pervasive cellular data and internet access have provided new tools to help disaster responders and people affected by a disaster.</p>
<p>“For disaster responders, detailed aerial and satellite imagery is accelerating disaster response and rebuilding, and new cloud-based tools can improve communication and collaboration. SMS- and internet-based systems allow victims of a disaster to request help and provide on-the-ground status reports.”</p>
<p>Dr Nevill-Manning will discuss specific responses to the Haiti, Chile and China earthquakes and to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.</p>
<p>Dr Nevill-Manning is being honoured this year with a University of Waikato Distinguished Alumni Award.</p>
<p>Dr Nevill-Manning will deliver his lecture “Nerds in Crisis: Using Technology to Respond to Disasters” at 6.30 pm on Thursday August 26 at the WEL Academy of Performing Arts on the University campus. A cash bar will operate from 5.30. All welcome.</p>
