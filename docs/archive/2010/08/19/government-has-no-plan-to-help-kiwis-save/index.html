<p><strong>Thursday, 19 August 2010, 12:24 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Government has no plan to help Kiwis save for retirement</strong>    <br>   <br>New Zealand Superannuitants want leadership, not another committee from a Government that has belatedly come to the realisation that Kiwis need to save more for retirement, says Labour’s Spokesperson for Senior Citizens Ross Robertson.</p>
<p>“Already our senior citizens are being hammered by increased costs.  They have had to endure cutbacks to home support services, ACC assistance and student allowances,” Ross Robertson said.</p>
<p>“There have also been reductions in funding for Adult Community Education, the targeting of safe driver training and tertiary education programmes for the elderly.</p>
<p>“And of course the upcoming rise in GST will further affect costs across the board.<br>“This ‘committee’ on compulsory super savings that National has proposed is proof that they don&#39;t have a real plan to make our economy stronger. </p>
<p>“This is the party that has scuppered every attempt to secure superannuation, and in this term alone they have suspended payments to the Super Fund and have gutted KiwiSaver.  Now, after two Budgets and nearly two years in power they want a ‘committee’.</p>
<p>“Labour knows New Zealand needs to save more and has done a lot of work in this area.”<br>Ross Robertson has been visiting Grey Power groups around the country to discuss current issues affecting seniors, and to listen to their concerns.</p>
<p>“There are strong indications out there that many of our seniors are struggling to make ends meet.  For approximately 53% of over 65s, the national superannuation is their only income.  It is all they have to live on,” Ross Robertson said.</p>
