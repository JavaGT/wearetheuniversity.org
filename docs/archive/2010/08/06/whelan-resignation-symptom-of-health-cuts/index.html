<p>**Whelan resignation symptom of sick series of health cuts<br>**</p>
<p>With more than 80 cuts to frontline health services already having been made, the resignation of Capital and Coast DHB Ken Whelan is likely to be just the first, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.</p>
<p>“DHBs around the country are slashing services under the direction of Health Minister Tony Ryall to save costs,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>“The National Party claimed in opposition that it would save millions by cutting backroom services and increasing frontline services. Those statements have turned out to be lies. In Government they are cutting mental health, smoking cessation, public health services and even diabetes services.</p>
<p>“I have nothing but respect for Ken Whelan’s honesty in saying he simply cannot continue to cut ‘without negatively impacting services’.</p>
<p>“Just last month Labour discovered through the Official Information Act that Capital and Coast would be cutting $5million from its mental health services, something that Tony Ryall tried to deny.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that the Minister of Health’s demands for cuts are having a negative affect on patients and the people charged with delivering patient services.</p>
<p>“Today in the Southern region people will take to the streets to demand Minister of Health Tony Ryall put a stop to a plan to strip that region of neurosurgery, something clinicians have said could lead to deaths and serious injury to patients.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile the Minister is busy ducking for cover. He should be fronting up to the public on the issue of health cuts.<br>“When the Chief Executive of one of the country’s largest DHBs resigns because he can’t face cutting more patient services and thousands of people take to the streets to protest government cuts in the southern regions, it is utterly disgraceful that the Minister of Health ducks for cover.</p>
<p>“Mr Ryall should front up and immediately put a halt to cuts that are hurting patients,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
