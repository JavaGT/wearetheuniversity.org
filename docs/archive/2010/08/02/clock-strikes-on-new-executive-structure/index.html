<p><strong>Monday, 2 August 2010, 4:35 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students'_Association">Otago University Students&#39; Association</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clock Strikes On New Executive Structure</strong>  </p>
<p>As soon as the clock struck 9am today, Otago University Students Association (OUSA) opened nominations for its 2011 Executive under a new structure as voted by the majority of students who participated in an online referendum.</p>
<p>The new structure sees the OUSA Executive reduced from 17 positions to 10.</p>
<p>“The new structure increases OUSA&#39;s ability to represent and advocate for its members” says OUSA President Harriet Geoghegan.</p>
<p>&quot;We can have as many representatives on the executive as could be imagined, but if our internal structure isn&#39;t functioning efficiently then we would be doing them a disservice.&quot;</p>
<p>“Under the current structure it can be difficult for representatives to bring all issues of their constituents to a full Executive meeting, and this structure ensures all issues can be fully discussed by people best placed to make good recommendations.”</p>
<p>”The representation structure will be strengthened next year by the establishment of eight committees - welfare, education, postgraduate, policy, finance and expenditure, recreation, communications and events.”</p>
<p>Nominations for the new positions are open now and close at 4pm this Friday August 6th.</p>
<p>A list of old positions and new positions is attached.</p>
