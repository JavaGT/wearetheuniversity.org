<p><strong>Labour Questions Super City Blind Spot On Public Transport</strong></p>
<p>Labour&#39;s Auckland Issues spokesperson Phil Twyford says there are disturbing signs public transport is being downgraded by the super city&#39;s powerful new transport agency.</p>
<p>He says the agency, which is currently recruiting staff, appears to have almost completely overlooked the need for ongoing development of the bus system, which still carries the majority of Auckland public transport passengers.</p>
<p>&quot;There are approximately 1000 jobs in the new transport agency. They have specialists on urban design, stormwater, cycling and walking, and several parking meter specialists. But no bus system development specialists as such.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a worry if it reflects a public transport blind spot. More than anything else Aucklanders want the super city to deliver a better public transport system.</p>
<p>&quot;The other possibility is that this is an oversight in the mad rush to meet Rodney Hide&#39;s compressed timelines for setting up the super city.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Twyford said observers had expected the agency to appoint a group of staff dedicated to expanding the initiatives that give buses priority, from bus lanes to special signals at traffic lights, and the green patches in the middle of intersections that allow buses to queue jump.</p>
<p>&quot;It is vital the development of the bus system is not neglected. Huge numbers of Aucklanders, especially in the outer suburbs, depend on the buses to get around the city. And the buses also feed the railway stations.</p>

<p>&quot;This public transport blind spot is reflected in the agency&#39;s 306-page workforce plan which is mostly about roads. Bus stops, bus shelters, and bus priorities only get one mention each in the entire document. The words bus lane only get one mention, and that is in the context of revenue collection.</p>
<p>&quot;Aucklanders don&#39;t expect perfection on day one, but they do expect the transport agency to make public transport a top priority. We cannot afford to lose highly qualified staff who have been responsible for big increases in public transport patronage in recent years.</p>
<p>Mr Twyford said he was also concerned newly appointed interm chief executive of the transport agency David Warburton did not appear to have any significant experience in urban transport.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand Mr Warburton did his PhD on dairy shed effluent at Massey. He was Wanganui District Council&#39;s CEO under Michael Laws, and then led a Melbourne-based engineering firm that does very little urban transport work.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Warburton may well be a good manager, but I would have thought leadership in big city transport systems would have been a prerequisite for this vitally challenging role.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been reported urban transport high fliers from Perth and London pulled out of the recruitment. That tells me managers from cities with successful transport operations might not be convinced the Auckland super city is serious about building a great public transport system.&quot;</p>
