<p>Brendon Burns</p>
<p>Water spokesperson</p>
<p>Christchurch Central MP</p>
<p>24 August 2010 <strong>Media Statement</strong><br><strong>Taxpayers fund galling Government pamphlet on water</strong></p>
<p>The National/ACT government’s expensive taxpayer-funded pamphlet shows it under-estimated how angry and concerned Cantabrians are about losing control of their water allocation, says Labour’s water spokesman Brendon Burns.</p>
<p>The Christchurch Central MP says the pamphlet repeats all the half-truths about Environment Canterbury’s record on water management and tells a few of its own.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister states we should be able to swim, fish and drink safely from our waterways and aquifers but fails to mention that he’s on-record saying he wants to see new water schemes in place next year in Canterbury. Environment Minister Nick Smith is now saying there is no way he can get new environmental controls in place before the next election.</p>
<p>“Meantime, Chinese-funded dairy corporate Synlait wants to double milk powder production at its Dunsandel plant and Fonterra is underway with plans for a plant to process 2m litres of milk a day at Darfield. We need new rules in place to protect our environment before such developments proceed to ensure our already poor record on water quality does not get worse.</p>
<p>Brendon Burns says the Government’s clumsy attempt to impose its growth agenda on top of Environment Canterbury’s own strategy to achieve sustainable outcomes has made water the number one issue in Canterbury.</p>

<p>“Having rammed through legislation in 36 hours to disembowel ECAN councillors and install its own Commissioners, the Government now has the gall to charge us for a pamphlet that ‘seeks our views’.</p>
<p>“The pamphlet also maintains the pretence that we might get back new elections for ECAN if we express our views when Nick Smith has already suggested moving to an elected water authority.”</p>
<p>Brendon Burns says the National/ACT government’s polling has clearly shown it that it’s made a major mistake in trampling on the democratic right of Cantabrians to decide who allocates and manages their water.</p>
