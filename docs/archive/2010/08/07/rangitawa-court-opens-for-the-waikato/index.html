<p><strong>Rangitawa Court opens for the Waikato</strong></p>
<p>Labour MP for Hauraki-Waikato Nanaia Mahuta says she is pleased to see the justice system reaching out to communities and the recognition that a Rangatahi court could work for young people in the Waikato.</p>
<p>The launch of the Waikato Rangitawa Court took place at Te Ohaaki Marae, Huntly today.</p>
<p>“I was particularly heartened to hear the speech from Chief District Court Judge Russell Johnson who commended the roll out of the 6 rangatahi courts throughout the country as a means of ensuring the justice system reaches out to the community in ways that those affected by it are treated fairly,” Nanaia Mahuta said.</p>
<p>“Too many young Maori are apprehended as offenders and are then locked into the justice system. I want to see the trend change and if rangatahi courts will form a critical part of that process then I am happy to support it.</p>
<p>“Youth advocates, community services, youth workers, drug and alcohol services, Kirikiriroa marae, and CYF are just a few of the critical partners that will contribute to the rangatahi court.</p>
<p>“The stark reality remains that more must be done to engage young Maori to be the best they can be in their whanau, in their communities, and in our society.</p>
<p>“I want to support all communities who want to stand up and make a positive contribution to the lives of young people that will see more positive outcomes.”</p>
<p>The rangatahi court will have its first scheduled sitting at Kirikiriroa marae, Hamilton on 15th September.</p>
