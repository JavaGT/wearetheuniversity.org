<p><strong>Saturday, 7 August 2010, 2:14 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party">The Maori Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Maori Party Candidate for Hauraki Waikato Announced</strong><br><strong>Saturday 7 August 2010</strong></p>
<p>Maori Party Vice-President, Heta Hingston, has today announced the successful Maori Party candidate for the 2011 General Election is Tauhuia Bruce Mataki</p>
<p>&#39;Bruce brings into the role, a distinguished career in the Defence Force, in Maori Business Development and in the agricultural sector&quot; said Mr Hingston.</p>
<p>&quot;He is proudly of Tainui waka, and knows the issues for whanau throughout the rohe, having worked closely with communities throughout South Auckland and Franklin Districts&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Bruce brings with him a successful background in business and enterprise, which will be of great value to the team, as we consider strategies to advance Maori economic development&quot; said Mr Hingston.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a hotly contested campaign, with three excellent candidates&quot; said Mr Hingston. &quot;We thank Pia Searancke, Hemi Rau and their support teams for their commitment over the last month of hui held in Papakura, Pukekohe, Paeroa, Huntly and ending in Hamilton.</p>
<p>&quot;I am humbled by the opportunity to serve the Maori Party in Hauraki Waikato&quot; said incumbent candidate Bruce Mataki.</p>
<p>&quot;I am a passionate supporter of the party and have a lot of energy for this new role. Hauraki Waikato is calling for a change - a fresh approach with someone completely focused on their local issues. I greatly look forward to the challenge of contesting the seat&quot;.</p>
