<p><strong>Frontline Health Cuts Top 100 – Thousands Of Patients Miss Out On Services</strong></p>
<p>Cuts to frontline health services have now reached 100 with elderly, the mentally unwell and public health services bearing the brunt, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.</p>
<p>“100 cuts to frontline services – it’s a staggering figure and means thousands of patients from those using home support services, emergency departments, diabetes and mental health services and smoking cessation are missing out on treatment,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>“But while cuts to frontline health services have now topped 100, Health Minister Tony Ryall and John Key continue to refer to them as ‘changes’. National’s health strategy is to cut health services and then simply lie about them.</p>
<p>“National lied about closing the gap with Australia and they are lying about increasing frontline health services.</p>
<p>“Even National’s much hyped increase in elective surgery has been shown to be a fudged fact. Budget documents clearly showing that funding increases for elective surgery were required to cater for the thousands of patients being dumped from ACC’s books on DHB waiting lists.</p>
<p>“When asked about the ongoing cuts to health services in New Zealand, the stock standard response from the National Government is to claim that more money is being put into health services than ever before.</p>
<p>“If there are record levels of health funding there should be no excuse for the current record level of health cuts. Not one patient should go without mental health service assistance, home help or smoking cessation support if National really is funding frontline health services at record levels.</p>

<p>“The reality is National spent $6 million on setting up the National Health Board, is spending $10 million per year paying for patients previously treated by ACC and is undertaking a programme of record health cuts.</p>
<p>“Patients deserve better. National is currently under pressure to prevent the Otago Neurosurgery service from being scrapped. But where is the Minister?</p>
<p>“Apparently he has gone to ground rather than face questions on neurosurgery, the resignation of the Capital and Coast CEO or face up to the public on health cuts in general,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
