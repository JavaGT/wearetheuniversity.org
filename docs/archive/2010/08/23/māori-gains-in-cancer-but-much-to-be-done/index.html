<p><strong>Māori gains in cancer, but much to be done</strong></p>
<p>A new report on Māori cancer trends by researchers from the University of Otago, Wellington shows progress in some areas, but that there is considerably more to be done to improve Māori health prospects.</p>
<p>Funded by Te Kete Hauora ( Māori Health Directorate, Ministry of Health), and prepared by Te Rōpū Rangahau Hauora a Eru Pōmare, this publication is the first to report Māori and non-Māori cancer patterns by rural–urban residence and area socioeconomic deprivation together.</p>
<p>The researchers also studied cancer trends for Māori and non-Māori over the period 1996-2006.</p>
<p>“It is heartening to see significant improvement in Māori cervical cancer outcomes” says co-author Bridget Robson, Director of the Eru Pōmare Māori Health Research Centre.</p>
<p>Māori cervical cancer mortality rates reduced by 11% per year over the eleven-year period while non-Māori rates fell by 5% per year, however Māori rates remain significantly higher.</p>
<p>“A strong focus on boosting the number of Māori women having regular smear tests and receiving the HPV vaccination should help to finally close the gap in Māori and non-Māori cervical cancer rates”.</p>
<p>“The drop in deaths from lung cancer among Māori men of 5% per year on average is also encouraging,” says Robson. “However the report shows that Māori are still dying from lung cancer at three times the rate of non-Māori and this disease accounts for nearly half the excess cancer deaths among Māori.”</p>
<p>“It’s vitally important to reduce the sales of tobacco and provide an environment that supports young Māori to be smokefree.”</p>

<p>The report also analysed cancer patterns for Māori and non-Māori living in urban or rural areas. They found rural residents were less likely to get cancer than people living in the larger cities or smaller urban areas. However, once diagnosed with some cancers, such as colorectal or prostate cancer, rural people have less favourable survival chances than those in main urban areas.</p>
<p>“We need to further investigate cancer diagnosis and treatment for rural communities, especially Māori, to make sure people get good access to early detection and prompt, appropriate treatment,” says co-author Donna Cormack.</p>
<p>Māori living in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods had the highest risk of cancer.</p>
<p>“The unequal impact of the economic recession on Māori jobs may seriously affect cancer outcomes and chances of getting an early diagnosis,” says Bridget Robson, “so this is the worst possible time to reduce funding that supports people with low incomes to access primary health care”</p>
<p>“We know that people working on cancer control are doing a great job,” says Robson “and we hope this report will be used to ensure that resources and efforts are targeted to those who need them most”.</p>
<p>The report titled <em>“Unequal Impact II: Māori and non-Māori Cancer Statistics by Deprivation and Rural–Urban Status 2002-2006”</em> is the second in the “Unequal Impact” series and can be found on the Ministry of Health website <a href="http://www.moh.govt.nz">www.moh.govt.nz</a> .</p>
