<p><strong>Tuesday, 17 August 2010, 10:57 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Mangere to get Trades Academy in 2011</strong></p>
<p>The Government today confirmed that Southern Cross Trades Academy based out of Mangere will be one of nine new Trades Academies to open in 2011.</p>
<p>&quot;This is great for our students and for Mangere. It will keep young people engaged in learning, while they gain valuable skills for the workforce,&quot; Mr Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
<p>&quot;National promised to provide more educational opportunities through Youth Guarantee and Trades Academies, and we&#39;re delivering on that promise.&quot;</p>
<p>Southern Cross High School in Mangere will offer National Certificate Level 2 in hospitality in 2011. Thirty places will be available, with students spending three days a week at Southern Cross and two days on work experience.</p>
<p>&quot;This innovative, flexible, and cooperative approach to education will help keep our 16 and 17 year olds within the education system longer and prepare them for work,&quot; Mr Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s fantastic for our community to be hosting one of nine academies that will help more than 800 young New Zealander&#39;s get the skills they need to succeed.&quot;</p>
<p>The academies are based on partnerships between schools, tertiary institutions, industry training organisations and employers. They enable students to earn both NCEA credits and a tertiary qualification, while gaining practical skills in the workplace.</p>
