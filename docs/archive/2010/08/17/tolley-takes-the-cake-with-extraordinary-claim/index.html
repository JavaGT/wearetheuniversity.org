<p><strong>Tolley ‘takes the cake’ with extraordinary claim</strong></p>
<p>Education Minister Anne Tolley’s claim today that 80 percent of schools are working well with national standards takes the cake for its audacity, says Labour Education spokesperson Trevor Mallard.</p>
<p>“The opposite is actually the case --- 80 percent of schools are still not well prepared to implement National’s quirky standards,” Trevor Mallard said.</p>
<p>“It is astonishing that we are more than halfway through the school year, that national standards were implemented in February, and just 19 percent of schools, according to her figures, are well-prepared to implement the standards.</p>
<p>“What’s happening to students in the other schools who are still trying to come to terms with National’s tragic experiment?”</p>
<p>Trevor Mallard said some schools were always going to find it easier to adjust to National’s standards than others, so it was not surprising that 19 percent are well prepared.</p>
<p>“But it is a real concern that only 19 percent fall into that category. Another 61 percent of schools are underway, but there’s a big difference between being underway to implementing the standards and actually implementing them well.</p>
<p>“Anne Tolley’s claim is quite dishonest. If that’s the sort of standard she sets herself, then schools and parents can be really worried.</p>
<p>“Her programme has been rushed into schools, with no trial, and no willingness to listen to objections,” Trevor Mallard said.</p>
<p>“It’s August --- and 81 percent of schools are still not well-prepared to implement the standards. That’s the truth of it.”</p>
