<p>Whitireia Polytechnic Fraud – Nothing New</p>
<p>The Young Nats renew their call on the Hon Steven Joyce to support legislation that will give students a choice as to whether they join a student union.</p>
<p>The Freedom of Association Bill, currently before the Education Select Committee, if passed will make membership of student unions voluntary.</p>
<p>“The news that a police investigation has begun into fraud allegations totaling $750,000 from Whitireia Polytechnic students&#39; association funds is nothing new, but merely the latest example in a long history of fraud, financial waste and irresponsibility by student unions,” says Daniel Fielding, Young Nats President.</p>
<p>“The plain reality is compulsory membership removes accountability from student unions, whose incomes are forcibly guaranteed regardless of services provided or actions taken.</p>
<p>&quot;The sad thing is students are the ones who are losing out. Students are forced to pay a levy regardless of whether they will use the services their fee provides and these levies add an estimated $10m to student debt every year.</p>
<p>“Our support is with the students of Whitireia who are demanding answers and have signed a petition calling for fresh elections.</p>
<p>&quot;While voluntary membership won’t solve all the problems it will introduce a system of financial accountability for student unions.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe this Government has a responsibility to give choice back to students,&quot; says Daniel Fielding.</p>
