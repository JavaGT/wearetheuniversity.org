<p>Greens welcome call-in of factory farm consents</p>
<p>The Green Party today welcomed Environment Minister Nick Smith’s decision to make the right call and call in consent applications for factory dairy farms in the Mackenzie country.</p>
<p>The decision comes after a concerted campaign by the Greens and environmental and animal welfare groups to oppose the consents to establish factory-style dairy farms in some of New Zealand’s most iconic high tussock land.</p>
<p>“This is a victory for the thousands of people who champion our environment, land, water, and animals,” Green Party Co-leader Russel Norman said.</p>
<p>“I want to thank every person who submitted against the proposals, sent e-cards to the Minister urging him to call in the consents, and joined social media groups opposing the consents.</p>
<p>“Together we have sent a clear message to the Government that they need to show leadership on this issue, not sit on their hands.</p>
<p>“The companies who applied for these consents should abandon them now. The huge public opposition shows that these proposals are a step too far.</p>
<p>“We need a comprehensive plan for the future of this precious area, rather than a series of ad hoc applications which will see it slowly destroyed piece by piece. The Minister should develop a National Policy Statement for the Mackenzie Country, because its biodiversity, landscape and water quality are of national significance,” Dr Norman said.</p>
<p>Dr Norman said he was pleased with the Board of Inquiry set up by the Minister to review the applications.</p>

<p>“I hope the board will travel and hold hearings in multiple locations to allow the thousands of kiwis who have concerns about these consents to be heard, especially those people in the Mackenzie itself. I also hope they will visit the area as I have and see first-hand the negative impact that intensive dairying is already having there.</p>
<p>“I am disappointed that the Board will not consider the animal welfare concerns associated with these consents. There clearly needs to be a more robust process for dealing with animal welfare concerns arising from resource consent applications. The Government should review and strengthen animal welfare codes to address this,” Dr Norman said.</p>
<p>Dr Norman said he was still concerned that land-use consents associated with the proposed farms were issued without public notification by the Waitaki District Council and would continue to pursue this issue.</p>
