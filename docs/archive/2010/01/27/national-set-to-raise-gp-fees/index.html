<p>27 January 2010<br>Media Statement</p>
<p>National set to raise GP fees?</p>
<p>Worrying reports that National is set to increase GP fees this year are beginning to emerge, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.</p>
<p>“Last year Health Minister Tony Ryall told Primary Health Organisation to save $25 million, and to achieve this it appears the Minister is preparing to raise GP fees,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>“Most people remember when Tony Ryall and John Key told a press conference that people didn’t have GP fees as their top of mind issue and that ‘market forces’ were the best way to set doctors fees and if people didn’t like it they could always go down the road or change doctors.</p>
<p>“National has repeatedly shown that it is seriously out of touch when it comes to primary health care. Last year they signed off on a 6.5 percent GP fee increase and now they are likely to sign off on another.</p>
<p>“The GPs and practice nurses are critical frontline services and it is essential that fees be kept at accessible levels.</p>
<p>“Raising GP fees as a way of saving money is yet another short-sighted move from the National Government.</p>
<p>“Increased GP fees will simply drive people through the doors of the National Emergency Departments, just like dumping people off ACC’s books left the health sector to pick up the tab. In the long run there is virtually no financial savings for the taxpayers.</p>
<p>“Having accessible primary health care actually helps to keep people out of hospital and that is where the real savings are.</p>

<p>“Tony Ryall has repeatedly claimed that he is committed to moving backroom services to the frontline. However, I strongly suspect the Minister has no idea what this actually means because so far rather than seeing less bureaucracy we have seen a new National Health Board established and swathes of frontline health services cut, not to mention beginning discussions about charging for some services delivered in public hospitals.</p>
<p>“I am deeply concerned that the changes being proposed in primary health care and hospital care by the National Government will make health services less accessible for people without the financial resources to pay significant amounts for their health care,” Ruth Dyson said.<br>Health Cuts since National came to office</p>
