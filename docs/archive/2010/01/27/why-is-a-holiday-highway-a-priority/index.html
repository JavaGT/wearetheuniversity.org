<p>27 January 2010 Media Statement</p>
<p>Why is a Holiday Highway a priority?</p>
<p>Mt Albert MP David Shearer is calling for the government to get its priorities right on Auckland Transport.</p>
<p>“National’s decision to fast-track the Puhoi to Wellsford stretch of State Highway One shows the Government is not tuned in to the needs of Auckland commuters,” David Shearer said.</p>
<p>“The Puhoi/ Wellsford road is a holiday highway which is only congested during the summer breaks. I share the frustrations that motorists have when heading north, but $1.4 billion could be better spent addressing Auckland’s major transport problems. And, building a by-pass at Warkworth, could ease much of the problem on that route for a tenth of the cost.</p>
<p>“Today’s announcement means important items that all the mayoral candidates have agreed on, such as the inner city rail loop in Auckland, will be put on hold. Auckland sees that as its number 1 priority for Auckland and economic development.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce’s fixation on building motorways means the real issues around Auckland’s transport network are being ignored. “NZ is building more motorways while most major cities in the world are moving towards other forms of transport. National is taking us in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>“Yes thousands of Aucklanders use the Puhoi/Wellsford road for a handful of weeks to holiday. But they’re also the same Aucklanders who are screaming out for a decent public transport system.”</p>
<p>David Shearer said National needs to take the blinkers off and listen to what people are saying are the real priorities for transport are.</p>
<p>“Aucklanders want their everyday transport woes to be eased. Pouring billions into a holiday highway is not a priority for them,”</p>
