<p><strong>Friday, 22 January 2010, 9:42 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>22 January 2010<br>Media Statement</p>
<p>Concerns growing about planned public hospital charges</p>
<p>Concerns are mounting within the health sector about the Southland and Otago DHBs’ consultation on introducing charges for some hospital level services, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.</p>
<p>“Both the New Zealand Medical Association and Association of Senior Medical Specialists have expressed their concerns regarding the effect charging patients for some services would have, and that the introduction of some charges is the start of slippery slope,“ Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>“Labour believes it is simply not credible for the DHBs involved to claim that those patients who can pay will not queue jump or be given preferential treatment.</p>
<p>“There are only so many doctors and nurses to go around and they should be available to help all people who walk through the public hospital doors on an equal basis rather than being tied up with paying patients first.</p>
<p>“People should be able to access services in the public health system on the basis of their medical needs not how much money they have.</p>
<p>“The DHB says it wants to charge for services in addition to those currently available but their consultation contains no information about what they actually intend to charge for . Instead they played on people&#39;s emotions by using words such as ‘cancer’ to manipulate them into agreeing to this appalling proposal.</p>
<p>“The submission process being followed by the DHBs has been a ridiculous sham; they haven’t given the public enough information to make a genuine submission and consulting over Christmas when people are distracted is simply a joke.</p>
<p>“The Minister of Health Tony Ryall should step in and stop this clearly flawed process. Unfortunately National has a record of welcoming cash registers into hospitals and clearly sees this softly, softly approach in Southland as a test for introduction to other public hospitals around New Zealand.</p>
<p>“I urge all people concerned about the thought of cash registers and credit card machines appearing in their hospital to make a submission to the Southland and Otago DHBs opposing this - because all New Zealanders should be concerned about this proposal as before you know it, this may be happening in your town,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
