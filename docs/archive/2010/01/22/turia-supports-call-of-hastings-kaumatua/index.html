<p>Turia Supports Call of Hastings Kaumatua<br>Thursday 21 January 2010<br>Tariana Turia, Co-leader of the Maori Party</p>
<p>Tariana Turia has expressed her support for long-time community advocate and Hastings District Councillor, Henare O’Keefe, who has made public his concern about the placement of a Corrections service centre in the midst of Flaxmere.</p>
<p>“I really admire the positive approach Henare has taken towards caring for the people of Flaxmere” said Turia.</p>
<p>Henare O’Keefe initiated the Enough is Enough Anti-violence rally in 2008 in which thousands of residents marched from Flaxmere to Hastings to rally together against rising levels of violence.</p>
<p>“So when we hear that Mr O’Keefe has objected to the proposal of a Community Work Operations Centre being planned for the area, we know that his objections come from a position of principle” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>Mr O’Keefe has stated that locating the centre in the midst of the community is treating Flaxmere as a “dumping ground”; and has organised a picket to take place at Flaxmere on Monday 25th January.</p>
<p>“This is a man who believes in whanau ora; who is a community leader, who has only positive aspirations for the people he serves”.</p>
<p>“Mr O’Keefe quite rightly asks, why not place a Sports Academy, or a University in Flaxmere; something for the community to feel proud of and to take an interest in?”.</p>
<p>Flaxmere is one of the most economically vulnerable communities in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“As I understand it, there are four liquor outlets in Flaxmere – and now the Corrections centre – what sort of message does that send to this community?”asks Mrs Turia. &quot;I wonder what level of consultation has gone on to get to this point?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It appears that there may be other designated Corrections land outside of the Flaxmere area&quot; said Mrs Turia. &quot;I would think that it would be preferable to look at existing Corrections land rather than take up valuable space right in the heart of this community&quot;.</p>
<p>“I will certainly be taking up his concerns with both the Minister of Corrections and the Minister of Local Government” ended Mrs Turia.</p>
