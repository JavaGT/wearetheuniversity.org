<p>Thursday, January 7, 2010<br>Centre links with Malaysian university</p>
<p>After a worldwide search, Massey’s Centre for Defence Studies has been chosen to collaborate with a leading Malaysian university on research and teaching.</p>
<p>The centre has signed a memorandum of understanding that will see it work closely with the National Defence University of Malaysia.</p>
<p>Centre director Professor Glyn Harper signed the agreement last month with Vice-Chancellor of the Malaysian university Lieutenant General Dato’ Pahlawan Hj Zulkifli bin Hj Zainal Abidin.</p>
<p>Professor Harper says the agreement will involve the two universities working together in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>“We’re looking to collaborate on postgraduate studies for academic staff and explore other areas of research,” he says. “Also, we will look into forming a joint masters programme in strategic and defence studies along with other forms of academic co-operation.”</p>
<p>Being chosen to partner the Malaysian university is recognition of the high regard in which the Centre for Defence Studies is held, Professor Harper says.</p>
<p>“The Malaysian university undertook a worldwide search for partners, so to be the first to sign an agreement such as this is a great endorsement of what we’re doing here.”</p>
<p>Professor Harper travelled to Malaysia to sign the memorandum of understanding.</p>
<p>The centre offers the Bachelor of Defence Studies, a unique programme that is the only one of its type offered in New Zealand. Subjects include military history, command/leadership, logistics, tactics, military technology, international relations, military law and the law of armed conflict.</p>
