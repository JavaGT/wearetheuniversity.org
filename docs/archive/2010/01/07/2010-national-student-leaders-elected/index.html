<p><strong>2010 National student leaders elected</strong></p>
<p>As students return to campuses nationwide later this year, their interests will be defended and represented by strong leadership in Wellington.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) has new national officers for 2010. David Do and Pene Delaney are the NZUSA co-Presidents, and Sophia Blair the NZUSA National Women’s Rights Officer.</p>
<p>&quot;Our key priorities are protecting the quality of tertiary education by fighting the threat of Roger Douglas’ voluntary student membership bill, and defending against possible future cuts to government funding,” says David Do.</p>
<p>David was the 2008 president of the Auckland University Students’ Association, and its 2007 Education Vice President. He was also its Welfare Officer between October 2004 and 2006. He has recently completed an Honours degree in Political Studies from Auckland University.</p>
<p>“Voluntary student membership will harm the quality of students&#39; experience at universities and polytechnics by cutting important student services and representation. Roger Douglas’ bill will cost students more, cost universities and polytechnics more, and ultimately cost the government more,” says Pene Delaney.</p>
<p>Pene was the 2009 president of the Waikato Students’ Union, and its 2008 Vice-President(Maori). He holds a Masters of Management Studies from Waikato University.</p>
<p>All three officers will be continuing strong advocacy and representation on behalf of tertiary students as well as fighting against voluntary student membership.</p>

<p>“As long as students are forced to borrow to live and student debt keeps going up, we’ll have plenty of work to do. And although women students are doing well in terms of participation, they continue to face difficulties in non-traditional areas, sexual harassment and assault, and a significant gender pay gap upon graduation,” says Sophia Blair.</p>
<p>Sophia was the 2009 NZUSA co-President, and was previously the 2008 Education Vice-President at the Auckland University Students’ Association. She will be completing her Honours degree in political studies at Auckland University this year.</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.</p>
