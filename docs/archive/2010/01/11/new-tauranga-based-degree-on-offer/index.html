<p>New Tauranga-based degree on offer</p>
<p>A new Tauranga-based pathway to a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with the University of Waikato is expected to attract a first year intake of up to 60 students and a second year intake of up to 40 students next month. (SUBS February 2010)</p>
<p>The new degree pathway is open to students who enrol at Bay of Plenty Polytechnic in the Diploma in Applied Computing Level 5 (DipAppCompL5) and then Level 6 (DipAppCompL6) following the prescribed degree pathway. If successful, these students will be guaranteed entry to their third (final) degree year at the University of Waikato based in Tauranga.</p>
<p>Up to 40 students who have already completed the Diploma in Information and Communications Technology Level 5 who enrol for a second year of Diploma studies this year in approved degree pathway courses will be eligible for their third degree year at Waikato starting next year.</p>
<p>This is the latest degree pathway to be established at Tauranga under the deed of co-operation signed by the University of Waikato and Bay of Plenty Polytechnic in 2006 to strengthen their commitment to work together to provide high-quality tertiary education and research in the Bay of Plenty region.</p>
<p>Other degree level courses offered in Tauranga under the arrangement include a Bachelor of Tourism, Bachelor of Teaching (Early Childhood Education), Bachelor of Business Analysis and a Bachelor of Management Studies. A Bachelor of Social Work is also available at the university’s Tauranga campus.</p>

<p>There were 781 University of Waikato students studying papers towards formal programmes in Tauranga in 2009, representing an increase in enrolments of 33% from the previous year.</p>
<p>University of Waikato Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Doug Sutton says, “Together with the Polytechnic, we are committed to provide education to meet the growing needs of the region.</p>
<p>“The programmes offered through our partnership enable students to staircase seamlessly between the two institutions from entry level qualifications to degrees. This is a unique relationship that combines the strengths of our two institutions to address identified skill shortages as well as to provide pathways to life-long learning opportunities in the Bay.”</p>
