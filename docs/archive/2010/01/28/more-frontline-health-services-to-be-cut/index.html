<p>28 January 2010 Media Statement</p>
<p>More frontline health services to be cut</p>
<p>More patients are to miss out on health care as yet another DHB moves to cut services, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.</p>
<p>“Taranaki DHB has announced that it will be looking to slash the number of ACC surgeries it carries out, cutting back waiting list surgery, reducing staff numbers, and the use of diagnostic radiology such as CT scans,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>&quot;This latest round of cuts to patient services discredits the National Government’s claims of moving backroom resources to the frontline.</p>
<p>“My concern is that frontline services are on the chopping block around the country. Meanwhile, all the Minister of Health Tony Ryall does is repeat his mantra ‘we are moving backroom to frontline’. In reality this is simply a lie.</p>
<p>“DHBs are not dumping backroom functions and increasing frontline services. Taranaki DHB announced service cuts, Canterbury DHB cut home support for up to 1200 elderly people, Southland and Otago DHBs are looking to implement cash for additional services charge, and rumours of GP fee increase are gaining momentum – all of which are frontline services.</p>
<p>“I am deeply concerned that patients around the country are beginning to miss out on vital health services while the Minister of Health is busy repeating his Public Relations slogans.</p>
<p>“Labour increased health services and the National Government is busy dismantling them,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
