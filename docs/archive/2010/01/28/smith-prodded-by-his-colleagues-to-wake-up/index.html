<p>28 January 2010 Media Statement</p>
<p>Smith prodded by his colleagues to ‘wake up’</p>
<p>Environment Minister Nick Smith has taken five weeks to wake up to his responsibility to intervene in the Mackenzie Basin factory farming consents debacle, says Labour water spokesperson Brendon Burns.</p>
<p>Commenting on the decision by Dr Smith to call in three large dairy effluent discharge consents and to establish a board of inquiry to decide on the applications, Brendon Burns said: “The sad thing is that he has needed to be prodded by his cabinet colleagues to take action.</p>
<p>“Environment Canterbury appealed to Dr Smith on 23 December. It has taken the Minister 35 days, and he would still be dithering if Agriculture Minister David Carter and other National MPs had not visited the area, and resolved to ‘share their thoughts’ with Dr Smith.”</p>
<p>Brendon Burns said he had raised the issue of Dr Smith sitting on the fence when he became aware 20 days ago of ECan’s request to the Minister.</p>
<p>“Nick Smith has now belatedly ‘discovered’ the national significance of these discharge consents.</p>
<p>“It has been apparent to every other New Zealander I have spoken to that it is a particularly stupid and offensive idea to factory farm nearly 18,000 cows in a fragile and iconic environment where freshwater quality is of such paramount importance.</p>
<p>“I suppose we should be grateful Dr Smith has finally come to his senses and woken up to his responsibilities,” Brendon Burns said. “But in terms of leadership on this issue, he has provided absolutely nothing.”</p>
