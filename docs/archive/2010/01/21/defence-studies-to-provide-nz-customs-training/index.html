<p>Defence Studies to provide NZ Customs training</p>
<p>The Centre for Defence Studies has signed an agreement with the New Zealand Customs Service to provide professional education for Customs employees.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey and the Comptroller of Customs, Martyn Dunne, signed the agreement at the Manawatu campus yesterday.</p>
<p>A programme developed at the centre will cover security, international affairs and intelligence.</p>
<p>Mr Maharey says the agreement recognises the developing scope of Defence Studies. “Our Defence Studies programme is one of the jewels of the University and it will now grow to cover areas that are of increasing importance in the field.”</p>
<p>The University’s established extramural programme will be ideal in allowing service staff to study part-time while working, Mr Maharey says.</p>
<p>Mr Dunne says the agreement will give his staff another option when they consider furthering their education. “We’re keen to see our staff continue with education and Massey will be able to offer both undergraduate and post-graduate programmes,” he says. “The agreement reinforces that we feel knowledge is a fundamental part of the Customs Service.”</p>
<p>Centre director Professor Glyn Harper says the number of staff at the centre would grow to accommodate new programmes in security and its related subjects. “The agreement is really a good endorsement of what we’re doing here at Massey. It shows our teaching is valued and has practical applications for those in the workforce.”</p>
<p>While only a small number of Customs Service students are expected to enrol this year, with more than 1300 staff Mr Dunne expects many more will take up the opportunity in the future. The service will cover the tuition costs.<br>ends</p>
