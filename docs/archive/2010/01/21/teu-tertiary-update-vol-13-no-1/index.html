<p>DEPT OF LABOUR PREDICTS MāORI EDUCATION JOBS AT RISK</p>
<p>A Department of Labour report, Māori in the New Zealand Labour Market,<br>shows that there has been a strong growth of Māori employed in education,<br>including tertiary education, over the last five years. However there are<br>likely to be job losses for Māori education workers in the upcoming eight<br>years.</p>
<p>The recently released report provides a detailed examination of Māori in the<br>labour market including educational, employment, unemployment and population<br>trends. It also seeks to capture the impact of the current economic downturn<br>on the Māori labour market.</p>
<p>Between 2004 and 2009 the number of Māori employed in education increased<br>from 19,800 to over 22,000, an increase of 12 percent - slightly higher than<br>the 11 percent rate of increase for non-Māori in working in education over<br>the same period.</p>
<p>However, the department forecasts that the outlook is less positive for<br>Māori education workers, with the number employed likely to fall by an<br>average of 0.6 percent per year until 2018. That would equate to more than<br>130 Māori education workers losing their job each year until 2018.</p>
<p>The report also notes that the total median hourly earning for Māori workers<br>in all jobs has failed to grow as fast as it has for non-Māori workers. In<br>2004 Māori were paid an average of $1.50 less per hour than non-Māori<br>workers. Last year that gap had increased to $2 per hour. Māori women&#39;s<br>median hourly earnings from wages and salaries were $16.43, compared with<br>$18.22 for all women. For Māori men, median hourly earnings were $18.31,<br>compared with $20.53 for all men.</p>

<p>ITP MECA DISPUTE ENTERS NEW YEAR</p>
<p>The Northern Advocate reported late last week that the ongoing ITP MECA<br>dispute could result in further disrupted courses next month.</p>
<p>President of the NorthTec branch of TEU, Eric Stone, said the union had<br>offered management a zero percent pay rise and rollover of all existing<br>conditions, but that management had rejected the offer and had been<br>steadfast in trying to lower conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;Our offer was pretty generous because CPI has gone up. There&#39;s a recession<br>but it&#39;s difficult to deal with employers who are mean-spirited and it’s no<br>wonder people are frustrated and angry.&quot;</p>
<p>NorthTec acting chief executive Paul Binney told the paper that that<br>polytechnic continued to work hard to achieve a settlement of the multi<br>employer collective agreement.</p>
<p>However, TEU national secretary Sharn Riggs says that by rejecting the zero<br>percent pay offer, the polytechnic CEOs have shown their motives were not to<br>limit spending or increase productivity after all, but to launch an attack<br>on union members and union rights.</p>
<p>&quot;To date polytechnic chief executives have been willing to spend a year<br>wasting taxpayers&#39; money by dragging out an industrial dispute that should<br>have ended months ago. According to the principles of current employment<br>law, it simply is not acceptable for a group of large employers to be<br>actively working to move a thousand union members off their collective<br>agreement onto much less secure individual agreements. It breaches the<br>fundamental principles of the Employment Relations Act.&quot;</p>
<p>UNESCO CALLS FOR RENEWED EFFORT ON EDUCATION FOR ALL</p>
<p>UNESCO has issued an urgent call to action for the international community<br>to invest in sustained aid to provide quality education for the most<br>marginalized and poorest learners worldwide.</p>
<p>In their comprehensive annual report on progress towards the Education<br>For All (EFA) goals, independent researchers warn that the global economic<br>crisis threatens the progress that has been made in the decade since the<br>world agreed to work towards the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.</p>
<p>While rich countries have &quot;moved financial mountains to stabilize financial<br>systems,&quot; they have failed to respond to the needs of the 1.4 billion people<br>who survive on less than $1.25 a day. &quot;Ultimately, the world economy will<br>recover from the global recession, but the crisis could create a lost<br>generation of children in the world’s poorest countries, whose life chances<br>will have been jeopardized by a failure to protect their right to<br>education,&quot; the report states.</p>
<p>While the report focuses strongly on primary education for children it also<br>notes that countries are neglecting the third goal of Education for All;<br>ensuring that the learning needs of all young people and adults are met<br>through equitable access to appropriate learning and life-skills programmes.</p>
<p>&quot;The global economic crisis has pushed learning and skills up the political<br>agenda. Governments across the world now face the challenge of providing<br>immediate support to the vulnerable while equipping people with the skills<br>they need to re-enter labour markets.&quot;</p>
<p>MASSEY, CANTERBURY AND OTAGO TO EXCLUDE MORE STUDENTS</p>
<p>Massey University and the universities of Canterbury and Otago announced<br>this month that they are strengthening their exclusion policies to limit the<br>number of underperforming students who return to study. Thousands of<br>students are likely to be excluded according to the Dominion Post.</p>
<p>Student representatives have reacted angrily to the news, with New Zealand<br>Union of Students Associations&#39; co-president David Do saying that<br>universities were using the policy as a punitive tool to clear students off<br>their books due to constrained funding.</p>
<p>&quot;Open entry is a very important feature of the education system. It&#39;s a<br>cornerstone of our public tertiary education system.&quot;</p>
<p>New Zealand Vice-Chancellors&#39; Committee deputy chairman Roger Field, of<br>Lincoln University, told the Dominion Post that rather than kicking<br>students out of university, his preference was to let in only those who were<br>likely to succeed. A &quot;major overhaul&quot; of entrance standards was needed.</p>
<p>TEU national president, Dr Tom Ryan, said however that students are<br>suffering from the new approach because universities and the Ministry of<br>Education are wilfully ignoring an increase in potential students.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry and universities both know that there is a baby boom-blip of<br>18 and 19 year olds currently trying to get into tertiary education. There<br>is pressure for places. The current rhetoric about excluding underperforming<br>students ignores the reality.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is not just under-performing students who are missing out, but young<br>people who genuinely want the chance to study and better themselves. If we<br>want to meet the minister’s goals of increasing New Zealand’s productivity<br>and wellbeing, by increasing the number of young people engaged in study,<br>especially Māori and Pasifika, then we need to be improving access to<br>universities, not limiting that access,&quot; concluded Dr Ryan.</p>
<p>AORAKI POLYTECHNIC BUYS PTES</p>
<p>Aoraki Polytechnic has just purchased Timaru private training enterprises<br>the Aoraki English Language College and Aoraki International College (AIC).</p>
<p>The Polytechnic&#39;s chief executive Kay Nelson announced the acquisition last<br>week, saying the Aoraki Polytechnic was delighted to be involved in a<br>transition that would see the two long-established providers of<br>international education join the polytechnic’s already successful<br>internationally-applied programmes.</p>
<p>Ms Nelson said the polytechnic was keen to increase its offering to<br>international students, and would be reviewing the international market’s<br>requirements and providing new and existing programmes to meet that market.<br>Much of that work would be in partnership with overseas educational<br>providers.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe many of our quality programmes provide an exciting opportunity to<br>international students to undertake study in Timaru. I see programmes such<br>as our respected outdoor education and hospitality programmes appealing to<br>overseas students.&quot;</p>
<p>Aoraki International College director Adrian Kerr said that in the 12 years<br>since the college was formed in 1998 around 2000 international students had<br>come through, with the bulk through the English Language School.</p>
<p>Mr Kerr said he was pleased that after 11 years operating the business he<br>could pass it on to Aoraki Polytechnic to allow the business to grow and<br>meet its full potential.</p>
<p>US COLLEGES FEEL PINCH DESPITE FEDERAL MONEY</p>
<p>US President Obama&#39;s US$40 billion federal investment in tertiary education<br>has been undermined by individual state funding cuts amounting to more than<br>that amount.</p>
<p>State support for colleges declined by 1.1 percent in the 2010 fiscal year<br>from the previous year. What spared higher education from much deeper cuts<br>was the nearly US$40-billion provided by the federal government through the<br>State Fiscal Stabilization Fund.</p>
<p>Without the stimulus dollars, the decline in state support for higher<br>education in 2010 would have been 3.5 percent since last year and 6.8<br>percent over the past two years.</p>
<p>Some states made large cuts in higher education this year even with the<br>stimulus money. Alabama, Massachusetts, and Vermont all have reduced<br>spending on colleges by nearly 20 percent since the 2008 fiscal year.</p>
<p>The fiscal situation for higher education may only get worse before the next<br>budget year begins. In Nevada, for example, Gov. Jim Gibbons, a Republican,<br>has asked all state agencies, including public colleges, to submit plans to<br>reduce spending by 6 percent to 10 percent to offset a projected<br>US$72-million shortfall.</p>
<p>Nearly 40 states expect revenue shortfalls for the 2011 fiscal year, which<br>begins in July in all but four states. And about half of the states will<br>have [10]spent all of their stimulus money for education by the end of the<br>current fiscal year.</p>
