<p>Honorary Doctorate For Former UC Chancellor</p>
<p>Former University of Canterbury Chancellor Dr Robin Mann will receive an honorary doctorate from his alma mater this year.</p>
<p>Dr Mann, who served as chancellor from 2003 to 2008, will receive an honorary Doctor of Science degree during one of the University’s four April graduation ceremonies.</p>
<p>Dr Mann said he felt “greatly honoured but humbled by the award”.</p>
<p>“It is not something I feel I deserve nor did I expect to receive. Having said that I must say I am delighted to accept the recognition in the spirit it is given.”</p>
<p>Dr Mann has strong and longstanding connections with the University. He completed three degrees in chemistry at the then Canterbury College of the University of New Zealand – BSc (1957), MSc (Hons) (1959) and PhD (1962) – and worked as a part-time lecturer at the University before embarking on a distinguished career in industry and management.</p>
<p>In 1961 he joined G L Bowron and Co Ltd tannery as a research chemist. He was appointed production director in 1969 and was managing director and chief executive officer from 1984 until his retirement from the firm in 2000. He was also general manager of tanning for Waitaki International Ltd between 1987 and 1989 and senior director and vice-president of Maruhachi Mawata and Co Ltd (Japan) from 1998 to 2000.</p>
<p>In recognition of his significant services to industry he was made a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Chemistry, a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Management, a Distinguished Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Directors and life member of both the New Zealand Tanners’ Association and the Canterbury Manufacturers Association.</p>

<p>Dr Mann has held directorships at a range of organisations and companies including Christchurch International Airport Ltd (1988-2001), New Zealand Trade Development Board (1995-2001), Wool Research Organisation of New Zealand Inc (2003-2008), Open Strategies Ltd (2003- ) and Skope Industries (2000- ). He is also a former president of the Canterbury branch of the Royal Society of New Zealand.</p>
<p>In 2003 he was made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to business and the community.</p>
<p>In 2001 Dr Mann was co-opted to the University Council and shortly afterwards was appointed Pro-Chancellor. He was appointed Chancellor in 2003. Since stepping down from Council at the end of May 2009, Dr Mann has continued serving the University in his role as Chairman of the UC Foundation, an independent, registered charitable trust associated with the University.</p>
<p>During his time as Chancellor, Dr Mann presided over more than 30 graduation ceremonies, shaking the hands of thousands of graduates. Now he is looking forward to being back on stage, this time as the one receiving a degree.</p>
<p>“It is many years now since I first crossed the stage of the Civic Theatre to receive my first degree and I remember how special it felt then. Because of that I always tried to make the occasion as memorable as possible for each of the graduates whose degrees I have had the privilege to confer.</p>
<p>“The nature of an ‘honorary degree’ will make this occasion for me even more special.”</p>
