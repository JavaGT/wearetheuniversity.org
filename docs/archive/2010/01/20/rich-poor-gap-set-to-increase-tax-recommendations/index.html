<p>Gap between rich and poor set to increase under Tax Working Group’s recommendations</p>
<p>Creating greater inequality by cutting taxes for the rich is bad for the economy, said Green Party Co-Leader Russel Norman today in response to the release of the findings of the Tax Working Group (the Group).</p>
<p>“The Tax Working Group’s main recommendation of aligning top personal tax rates with a corporate tax rate of 30% will create a chasm of social inequality between the richest and poorest in New Zealand,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“It’s not fair to ask those earning less to pay disproportionately more in tax.”</p>
<p>The Group has found that significant levels of tax avoidance are taking place through company and trust vehicles. The Greens support a targeted strategy of closing these loopholes.</p>
<p>“The Group has got it wrong on personal tax levels. Internationally speaking, New Zealand already has some of the lowest top personal tax rates in the world. A move to make them even lower is a radical, hugely regressive step towards a flat tax system and a more unequal society.</p>
<p>“Almost every modern social and environmental problem — ill-health, violence, drugs, obesity, mental illness, big prison populations — is more likely to occur in a less equal society.”</p>
<p>To address the disproportionate levels of investment in unproductive assets like property, the Greens support a capital gains tax on investment properties — a progressive move that would broaden the tax base by nearly $4 billion.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why the Group is shy on a capital gains tax when nearly every other developed nation has one. A capital gains tax is one of the most pragmatic ways to broaden the tax base,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“The Greens are also disappointed that the Group failed to make any recommendations around the possible introduction of environmental taxes as a tax-broadening alternative.”</p>
<p>Eco-taxes enable tax relief while encouraging better environmental outcomes.</p>
<p>“Overall, the Tax Working Group’s cooked up a policy recipe for inequality, and inequality is bad for the economy, bad for us all,” added Dr Norman.</p>
