<p>8 January 2010<br>Media Statement</p>
<p>Minister’s intervention welcomed but Cabinet should go further</p>
<p>The decision of the Environment Minister Nick Smith to intervene in the factory dairy farming resource consents in the Mackenzie Basin has been welcomed by Labour water spokesperson Brendon Burns.</p>
<p>Dr Smith announced today that he is working with Environment Canterbury which wrote to him on 23rd December asking if he might call in the three mega-farm resource consents, given widespread public opposition.</p>
<p>Dr Smith has indicated he may appoint an official from the Environmental Protection Agency to assist ECan as it continues to process the resource consents.</p>
<p>Brendon Burns says that may assist, but the issues raised by the resource consents submission process indicate a range of serious concerns for New Zealand’s export and tourism base and for the water quality of the MacKenzie Basin’s pristine lakes.</p>
<p>“I would hope that the first Cabinet meeting of the year on January 19th will consider these potential wider impacts on New Zealand and look at whether a wider intervention than that proposed today by Dr Smith is appropriate and feasible.</p>
<p>“The MacKenzie Basin’s fragile environment is too precious to be put at any risk,” Brendon Burns says.</p>
