<p>MEDIA RELEASE<br>8 January 2010</p>
<p>Muslim youth adapting well to life in New Zealand</p>
<p>A recent survey of Muslim youth shows that despite the challenges of living as members of a religious minority, Muslim youth are adapting well to life in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Victoria University study examined life satisfaction, psychological symptoms, school adjustment and behavioural problems as indicators of psychological and social well-being in 180 Muslim youth, aged 13-19 years.</p>
<p>The findings revealed that Muslim youth demonstrated more positive outcomes on all indicators than their Maori and Pakeha peers.</p>
<p>The study also found that Muslim youth strongly identify as New Zealanders, but it is their identity as Muslim that predicts better psychological and social adaptation.</p>
<p>Professor Colleen Ward from Victoria University’s Centre for Applied Cross-cultural Research believes that religion, strong family support and the relatively tolerant atmosphere in multicultural New Zealand facilitate psychological and social well-being amongst Muslim youth.</p>
<p>“Immigrant and minority youth thrive when they are able to maintain their religious and cultural traditions and participate in a fair and equitable way in New Zealand society. Integration is beneficial for individuals, communities and wider society,” said Professor Ward.</p>
<p>The research was conducted as part of a Foundation for Research, Science and Technology funded project, ‘Youth Voices, Youth Choices’.</p>
<p>The project also involves leadership development workshops throughout January for Muslim youth in Christchurch (Sunday 17), Wellington (Wednesday 20) and Auckland (Saturday 23). The workshops are supported by the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand (FIANZ) and the New Zealand Federation of Multicultural Councils (NZFMC).
