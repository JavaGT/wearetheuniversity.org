<p>Spokesperson for Tertiary Education</p>
<p>Joyce needs to explain fewer university places</p>
<p>Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce needs to explain why his policies are delivering fewer university places for first year students next year, despite high unemployment and the Minister having taken money from workplace training to pay for more places, Grant Robertson Labour Tertiary Education Spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“The University of Otago has announced that there will be 224 fewer places for first year students next year.  It is crazy at a time of high unemployment, and a need for a more skilled workforce for there to be a reduction in the number of tertiary places available at one of our major universities. &quot;</p>
<p>“If this trend is reflected in other universities there will be a significant reduction in the number of first year places, despite Mr Joyce&#39;s ‘robbing Peter to pay Paul’ routine when he took $55 million from industry training to pay for more university places.&quot;</p>
<p>“Mr Joyce needs to answer how this has happened.  He also needs to explain to New Zealanders whether his government is comfortable with New Zealanders being left out of tertiary education when there are simply not jobs available for them to go into. &quot;</p>
<p>“Mr Joyce has said his aim is to &quot;dampen demand&quot; in tertiary education.  This is nonsensical and short-sighted. Now is the time to invest in the future of New Zealand rather than shut the door on those who are wanting to learn and improve their skills” Grant Robertson said.</p>
