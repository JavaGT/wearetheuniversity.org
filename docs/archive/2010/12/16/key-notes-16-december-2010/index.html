<p><strong>HAPPY CHRISTMAS</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s been another busy year for the National-led Government. We&#39;ve delivered on our promises and focused on the issues that matter to you - the economy, law and order, health, and education.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve spoken to lots of parents recently about National Standards, and it&#39;s great to hear how happy they are with the plain-language National Standards reports they&#39;ve had from their child&#39;s school.</p>
<p>When I go away on holiday with my family this Christmas, I&#39;ll be thinking about the challenges and opportunities of 2011.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be thinking about next year&#39;s Budget and how we can lift the performance of the economy. Treasury&#39;s latest half-yearly update shows that we need to press on with <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-14091.link">our comprehensive economic growth plan next year</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll also be thinking about the Rugby World Cup. This will be the largest sporting event we&#39;ve ever hosted. I know lots of Kiwis are looking forward to being part of the World Cup - and of course cheering on the All Blacks.</p>
<p>And I&#39;ll be looking forward to next year&#39;s general election. National has a team we can be proud of, a record we can campaign on, and forward-looking policies that will take New Zealand the next step towards a brighter future.</p>

<p>Thanks for all your feedback and support this year - and please keep it coming next year. All the comments you post on my website and Facebook, and all the emails you send, help me and my staff get a good idea of what matters to you.</p>
<p>I hope you and your family enjoy spending time together and relaxing over the holiday season. My thoughts will be with the families of the 29 men lost in the Pike River Mine tragedy, all those affected by the Canterbury earthquake, and anyone who has lost a loved one this year.</p>
<p>Have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. See you in 2011.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p><strong>John Key<br>Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p>ENDS  </p>
