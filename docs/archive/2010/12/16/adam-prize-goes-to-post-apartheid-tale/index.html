<p><strong>Adam Prize goes to post-apartheid tale</strong></p>
<p>An intense coming-of-age story set in post-apartheid South Africa has taken out the prestigious Adam Foundation Prize in Creative Writing for 2010.</p>
<p>This year&#39;s winner is Rayne Cockburn for her novel <em>Someplace for Boys</em>. Set in a beach community in the Transkei in 1995, it explores a crucial period of social change in South Africa. Concentrating on two white adolescent boys, the book explores race, identity and friendship.</p>
<p>Supported by Wellingtonians Denis and Verna Adam through the Victoria University Foundation, the $3000 prize is awarded annually to an outstanding student in the Master’s in Creative Writing programme at Victoria&#39;s International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML).</p>
<p>Rayne is originally from South Africa, coming to Wellington two years ago to complete her Bachelor of Science in Psychology with a second major in English Literature. Prior to her Master’s she had no experience as a fiction writer and has not been published.</p>
<p>Damien Wilkins, co-convenor of the Master’s programme, says he felt privileged to be among the first readers of Rayne&#39;s novel.</p>
<p>“I think it&#39;s a remarkable book. On the face of it there&#39;s a simple story of a white family at their holiday home in the Transkei and then the story deepens and you realise you&#39;re reading about an entire nation. The novel feels &#39;important&#39; but it&#39;s always humble—that&#39;s a deeply exciting combination. It&#39;s also very funny at times.”</p>
<p>Award-winning author and TV presenter Emily Perkins was external examiner for <em>Someplace for Boys</em>. She praised the novel&#39;s beautifully drawn characterisations, the unpredictably unfolding story, the poise of its language and called it “a superb achievement”.</p>
<p>Mr Wilkins said the standard of folios was extremely high.</p>
<p>“We seem to say this every year but it happens to be true—there were a number of writers who might have won this year&#39;s award, including some exceptional poets.”</p>
<p>Previous Adam Foundation Prize recipients include acclaimed authors Catherine Chidgey, Paula Morris, William Brandt and Eleanor Catton.</p>
