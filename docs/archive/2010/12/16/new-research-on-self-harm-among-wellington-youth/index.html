<p><strong>New research on self-harm among Wellington youth</strong></p>
<p>Research has shown more than one in ten young people in Wellington are engaging in deliberate self-harm behaviour.</p>
<p>Dr Jessica Garisch, who graduated with a PhD in Psychology from Victoria on Tuesday, studied deliberate self-harm among Wellington secondary school and university students.</p>
<p>She researched self-harm behaviours that are not typically lethal including cutting, burning, breaking bones, scratching, dripping acid on the skin, pulling hair or hitting.</p>
<p>“My research aimed to find out about the factors related to self-harm, who thought about it, who did it, the stereotypes associated with these people and the barriers to seeking help,” says Dr Garisch.</p>
<p>In her research, she did a survey of more than 2000 students aged 16 to 19, did a diary study and interviewed guidance counsellors around the region.</p>
<p>“Of the youth studied, a third to half of the students had tried self-harm in the past or had thought about it, and currently 12 percent were engaging in self-harming behaviour.”</p>
<p>Her research found that low self-esteem was a big factor for those who self-harm, as were concerns over sexuality or having friends or family members who self-harm.</p>
<p>“I also found a difference between self-harm in young males and females. For males, social factors or having friends and family who self-harm were the biggest factors. For females, it was emotional difficulties or low self-esteem.”</p>
<p>Dr Garisch says understanding there are lots of different reasons behind self-harm behaviour and increasing knowledge of the issue is vital.</p>
<p>“When I asked teachers about how they reacted to the behaviour, they didn’t know how to respond. Stereotypes of those who self-harm are also major barriers in stopping students talking about the problem.”</p>
<p>Next year, Dr Garisch plans to visit secondary schools in the Wellington region which are interested in learning more about the outcomes of her research</p>
