<p><strong>Monday, 13 December 2010, 12:51 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Record number of PhDs for Victoria</p>
<p>A record number of PhDs graduates, including the first ever from the New Zealand School of Music, are among hundreds of students celebrating graduation from Victoria University this week.</p>
<p>Almost 1000 students, including 69 PhDs, will this week celebrate successfully completing their studies at a graduation procession and ceremonies.</p>
<p>Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Pat Walsh says the high number of PhD graduates reflect Victoria’s growing postgraduate programme as it becomes a more research intensive university.</p>
<p>“This is the most doctorates we’ve awarded at any graduation. During the past five years, the number of postgraduate students at Victoria has increased more than 50 percent.”</p>
<p>In addition to the first PhD graduate of the New Zealand School of Music, Daphne Rickson, the December Graduation also sees the first PhD from Victoria’s Faculty of Engineering, Kok Lim Yau, who is graduating with a PhD in Network Engineering.</p>
<p>Professor Walsh says getting a degree from Victoria is the result of hard work and dedication.</p>
<p>“Victoria has an established reputation both in New Zealand and internationally for academic excellence and the calibre of its research and postgraduate study—getting a degree is not just a matter of turning up to class.</p>
<p>“We strive to produce graduates with skills in communication, creativity and critical thinking, and leadership who will make a valuable contribution to the New Zealand economy and society.”</p>

<p>Professor Walsh says that the week of graduation not only adds vibrancy to the capital city—it also boosts the local economy.</p>
<p>“A number of family members and friends come from out of town to attend the parade and ceremonies, florists are kept busy putting together congratulatory bunches of flowers, and restaurants and bars are overflowing as people go out to celebrate afterwards.”</p>
<p>The December graduation will also see Honorary Doctorates granted to New Zealand physicist Professor Sir Paul Callaghan, and international expert on the Irish diaspora, Professor Donald Akenson.</p>
