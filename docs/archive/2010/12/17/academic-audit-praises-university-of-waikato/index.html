<p><strong>Academic audit praises University of Waikato</strong></p>
<p>The University of Waikato has been commended in an academic audit for its Māori distinctiveness, its care of students, its commitment to the regions it serves and its focus on research-led teaching.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Universities Academic Audit Unit report, released on December 15, looks at all aspects of an institution that are related to academic activity. Waikato is the fifth of New Zealand’s eight universities to undergo a Cycle Four Audit between mid 2008 and mid 2012.</p>
<p>The university completed a self-review in May, and a panel visited the university’s campuses in Hamilton and Tauranga in August to talk to staff.</p>
<p>The subsequent report has praised the university for its involvement with more than 16 iwi throughout the central North Island and Bay of Plenty region and the way in which Māori heritage and identity is embedded in the institution. It also praised the university for the pastoral care of Māori students and the provision for students to be taught, supervised and assessed in Te Reo Māori.</p>
<p>Other highlights in the report included:<br>• The project to turn the library into the Student Centre, and the five-star rating from the New Zealand Green Building Council<br>• The university’s comprehensive pastoral care and student support<br>• The focus on students being taught by staff who are active in research<br>• That the university demonstrates real strength and commitment in serving its regions<br>• The energy, commitment and achievements of the university’s research leaders<br>• The university’s strong community engagement with a wide range of stakeholders<br>• The sustainability principles that are incorporated into a wide range of university activities<br>• The important contribution the university is making through its strong links with the Bay of Plenty region<br>• The provision of a wide range of professional development opportunities for all staff.</p>

<p>Professor Crawford says the university makes important economic, social and cultural contributions to the Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions, and the nation, and it is pleasing to have these publicly acknowledged.</p>
