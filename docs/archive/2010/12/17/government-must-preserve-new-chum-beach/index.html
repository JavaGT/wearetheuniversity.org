<p><strong>Friday, 17 December 2010, 1:52 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Phil Goff<br><strong>Leader of the Labour Party</strong></p>
<p>17 December 2010<br><strong>Media Statement</strong></p>
<p><strong>Government must preserve New Chum Beach</strong></p>
<p>Labour Leader Phil Goff is calling on the Government to front up with the money needed to help preserve the untouched beauty of New Chum beach, in light of today’s generous offer from the developers to provide half of the funding.</p>
<p>“John Key and National must come to the party and match that generosity. This beautiful wilderness beach on the Coromandel must be protected,” said Phil Goff.</p>
<p>The Labour leader last month led a delegation to meet Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson about the proposal for the Department of Conservation to purchase 360 hectares of land adjacent to New Chum beach.</p>
<p>Phil Goff also wrote to Prime Minister John Key about the issue on November 17, but he has not replied.</p>
<p>“I really hope the Prime Minister has a happy holiday in Hawaii. But while Waikiki is nice, it’s not in the league of New Chum beach which is world renowned for its unspoilt, untouched shores.</p>
<p>“The owners of New Chum are ready to co-operate and contribute towards the preservation of the beach. John Key must commit to matching that generosity.</p>
<p>“The Government’s managed to find the cash to bail out South Canterbury Finance and to buy missile defence systems for our frigates. John Key should be able to find enough funding to save New Chum for the enjoyment of future generations.</p>
<p>“The benefits would not only be the preservation of an iconic and untouched part of our heritage but also economic in terms of New Zealand’s branding and its attraction to tourists.”</p>
