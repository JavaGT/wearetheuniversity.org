<p><strong>Confidence in Ngā Whanaketanga Highlights Flaws with National Standards</strong></p>
<p>There is confidence that Ngā Whanaketanga could make a difference to Māori student achievement, in sharp contrast to mainstream National Standards, says the education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa.</p>
<p>Ngā Whanaketanga Rumaki Māori – National Standards for Māori-medium schools – have been officially launched and will be introduced next year after being trialled this year.</p>
<p>NZEI says Ngā Whanaketanga will be welcomed in Māori-medium schools because they have been developed in full consultation with whānau and teachers and are directly linked to the curriculum.</p>
<p>“Unlike the implementation of National Standards in mainstream schools, there is confidence that Ngā Whanaketanga will actually support student learning because teachers and parents have had opportunities along the way to change and refine them,” says NZEI President Frances Nelson.</p>
<p>The Minister of Māori Affairs and Associate Education Minister Pita Sharples is hailing Ngā Whanaketanga, saying they will help keep Māori-medium students engaged in their education and raise their achievement.</p>
<p>“That is all very well but what about the education of the 85% of Māori students who are in mainstream schools?” asks Ms Nelson.</p>
<p>“They are being subjected and measured against a narrow set of untried and untested National Standards which have no Māori perspective and will only serve to demotivate those students who are struggling by constantly telling them they are below standard. Dr Sharples should turn his attention to that,&quot; she says.</p>
