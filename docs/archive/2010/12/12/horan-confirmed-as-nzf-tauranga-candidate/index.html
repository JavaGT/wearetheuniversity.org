<p><strong>Rt. Hon Winston Peters</strong><br><strong>Leader NZ First</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>December 12th 2010</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Horan Confirmed As NZF Tauranga Candidate</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First has selected Tauranga businessman Brendan Horan as its candidate for Tauranga at the 2011 General Election.</p>
<p>He is the first NZ First candidate to be confirmed for the election.</p>
<p>Brendan Horan is married to Miranda and they have two children.</p>
<p>Although most recently known as the TV One “weatherman”, Mr Horan is also an accomplished singer and entertainer. He has performed with John Rowles, Eddie Lowe and Tina Cross.</p>
<p>He is also an accomplished sportsman and has been involved in surf lifesaving from an early age. He has represented New Zealand in outrigger canoe, waterpolo, world professional lifeguard championships, and ocean surf ski racing. He has captained the world professional lifeguard team. He received a bravery award for the rescue of two Cronulla surf life savers during a cyclone at Cronulla Beach, NSW, Australia</p>
<p>Mr Horan is Regional Manager and part owner of Goldbuyers NZ Bay of Plenty and Waikato region.</p>
<p>He says New Zealand First already has a fine track record of dealing with the main issues facing Tauranga through the efforts of its former longstanding MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Since Winston left nothing has really happened in Tauranga except the young people have been loaded with more student debt, self employed small business owners are really struggling and senior citizens are being continually threatened with lower superannuation or a higher retiring age.</p>

<p>“New Zealand First has a list of positive policies that will benefit the entire country. We will be ensuring that Tauranga&#39;s needs are placed high on the agenda in fitting with its role as the fastest growing city in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“We will be a strong independent voice in Parliament after the next election and we will deal with the serious business such as preventing further sales of local assets to foreign owners and putting New Zealanders and their interests first,” said Mr Horan.</p>
