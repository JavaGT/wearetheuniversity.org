<p><strong>Media Statement</strong></p>
<p><strong>Redundancy petition a second chance</strong></p>
<p>The petition by Labour MP Darien Fenton and signed by 1441 others calling for redundancy protections was presented in Parliament today.</p>
<p>“Earlier this year, the government had a chance to do the right thing by supporting my bill that would have provided for notice and compensation for workers who are laid off through no fault of their own,” said Darien Fenton.</p>
<p>“But the government voted the bill down. Unfortunately, workers are still being laid off with nothing to tide them over during the hard times while they look for another job.</p>
<p>Darien Fenton said the sad thing is many redundant workers who were laid off during the last two years are still looking for work.</p>
<p>““These workers have been left high and dry,” said Darien Fenton.</p>
<p>“The only thing the government has done is make is easier for workers to be sacked without reason in the first 90 days of employment should they actually find another job.</p>
<p>“I’m hoping that the government will reconsider its position on basic redundancy pay and notice, and as we head towards the Christmas period, reflect on the impact on the thousands of workers who have suffered unnecessarily because they failed to act,” Darien Fenton</p>
