<p><em><strong>Media Statement</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Parents in Otago to face increased ECE costs</strong></p>
<p>Parents in Otago will face increased early childhood education costs of up to $40 per child per week because of National Government funding cuts, says Labour MP Clare Curran.</p>
<p>“Labour has conducted the largest survey of Early Childhood Education centres around the country and has found centres are increasing costs and reducing staff,” said Clare Curran.</p>
<p>The nationwide survey included 56 out of 64 ECE services in Otago and showed they were losing an average of $48,500 of funding per service. In response to the Government cuts, they were raising fees from $5 to $40 per week.</p>
<p>The survey showed that across New Zealand 89% of the services losing funding will increase fees in February and almost 49% will reduce qualified staff to cut costs.</p>
<p>“This is the worst time for families to face further cost increases.</p>
<p>“The Government cuts mean that parents pay more for getting less in terms of quality.”</p>
<p>59% of the services surveyed expected participation to drop as a flow-on effect of the cuts, with an alarming 81% expecting participation to drop in centres being used by low-to-average income families.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister of Education is busy trying to blame kindergartens and other services for the fee increases, but the truth is that her Government cut funding for children&#39;s education in May&#39;s budget and that is causing fee increases.</p>
<p>“National promised during the election to keep early childhood education subsidies, and now they have broken that promise and parents are paying the price, literally.</p>
<p>“Around the country thousands of parents have taken to the streets to march against these cuts and Labour is urging all parents opposed to increased fees and last week I received 20,000 postcards from people are calling for the cuts to be reversed.</p>
<p>“John Key needs to step in and stop the cuts from going ahead in February.”</p>
