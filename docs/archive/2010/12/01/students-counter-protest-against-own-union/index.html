<p><strong>Students Counter-Protest Against Own Union</strong></p>
<p><strong>NZUSA Protests Crashed By Real Students</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Students across the country have taken to the streets to counter-protest against their own union, in support of Voluntary Student Membership and the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill,&quot; says ACT on Campus President, Peter McCaffrey.</p>
<p>&quot;The New Zealand Union of Students&#39; Associations held pro-compulsion rallies but, despite having hundreds of thousands of dollars of students&#39; money for advertising, were only able to scrape together a dozen protesters in Wellington and couldn&#39;t find ANY Otago students willing to oppose the bill and so didn&#39;t even bother to hold a protest down south.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;While the NZUSA protesters were mostly NZUSA officials, former officials, staff and other trade unionists, real students crashed the NZUSA rallies and counter-protested in support of the bill.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How can students&#39; associations continue to claim that students are opposed to VSM when their own members are protesting against their position?,&quot; asks McCaffrey.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly NZUSA are more interested in ensuring their own pockets remain lined with compulsorily acquired student money than actually advocating for the views of students,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The VSM bill will give choice back to students and will ensure that students&#39; associations accurately represent their member&#39;s views.&quot; says ACT on Campus President, Peter McCaffrey.</p>
