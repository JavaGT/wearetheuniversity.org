<p><strong>Study aims to better predict outcomes for critically-ill kidney patients.</strong></p>
<p>Doctors should in future be able to better predict the outcomes of patients with rapidly deteriorating kidneys thanks to newly funded University of Otago, Christchurch, research.</p>
<p>Dr John Pickering, Senior Research Fellow at the University’s Christchurch Kidney Research Group has just been granted $306,666 for his study <em>Critically ill with a failing kidney: how can we predict what happens next?</em>  </p>
<p>The grant is a Fast Start one from the prestigious Marsden Fund.</p>
<p>&quot;With this grant I hope to make a positive difference to the health of thousands of people. It&#39;s a privilege to be part of a team at the University and in the hospital doing good science with such positive intent.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Pickering says rapid deterioration in kidney function affects about one third of all critically ill patients in intensive care units and drastically reduces their chance of survival.</p>
<p>Detecting this condition is very difficult and currently relies on measuring the build-up of a substance called “creatinine” in the blood, he says.</p>
<p>It takes one to three days for this build-up to be detected. This delays treatment (often dialysis) and has made development of new treatments very difficult.</p>
<p>Adding to the challenge is the normal intensive care practice of giving fluids through an intravenous drip, which dilutes the creatinine concentration.</p>
<p>Dr Pickering is developing a mathematical model to predict creatinine concentration and will test the model on patients in Christchurch Hospital.</p>
<p>He says the ultimate goal of the Christchurch Kidney Research Group is to develop new ways of detecting and treating acute kidney injury to save lives.</p>
