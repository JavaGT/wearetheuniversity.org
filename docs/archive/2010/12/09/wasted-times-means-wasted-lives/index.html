<p><strong>Thursday, 9 December 2010, 4:27 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Iain Lees-Galloway<br><strong>Associate Health Spokesperson</strong>  </p>
<p>9 December 2010 <strong>Media Statement</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wasted times means wasted lives</strong>  </p>
<p>The government has wasted two years bringing legislation to rid NZ of tobacco displays before the house, Labour Associate Health spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway says</p>
<p>“Ten thousand more people have during the last two years died from tobacco related disease while the National Government have spent fobbing off the Labour Party and health experts on this issue,” Iain Lees-Galloway said.</p>
<p>“Labour is supports banning tobacco display advertising but wonders why it hasn’t taken National so long to introduce legislation seeking to ban it.</p>
<p>“In nine years in Government, Labour got smoking out of workplaces, out of bars and restaurants and increased excise tax. It put in place quit programmes and it worked hard to ensure people who wanted to quit smoking were supported.</p>
<p>“National opposed every one of those initiatives. Nine long years of scaremongering and 2 long years of delay isn&#39;t good enough.</p>
<p>“National and their Maori Party friends have nothing to be proud of. Just this year they cut millions of dollars out of budgets for smoking cessation programmes and they delayed again and again when it came to getting rid of point of sale advertising of tobacco products.</p>
<p>“Only Labour has been consistent on this issue.</p>
<p>“Labour believes in getting rid of tobacco display advertising and helping people to stop smoking in order to have a healthier population,” Iain Lees-Galloway said.</p>
