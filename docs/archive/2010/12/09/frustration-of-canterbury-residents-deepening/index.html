<p>Frustration of Canterbury residents deepening</p>
<p>Frustration for Canterbury residents is deepening as they continue to wait for critical information following the earthquake, says Labour&#39;s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson and Waimakariri MP Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
<p>Clayton Cosgrove said around 300-400 residents attended a public information meeting he organised in Kaiapoi last night for earthquake-affected residents, including residents from Casebrook, Northwood, Belfast, Redwood and Kaiapoi. The meeting was also attended by representatives from the Earthquake Commission, the insurance industry, the Waimakariri District Council, Fletcher Building and the Red Cross.</p>
<p>&quot;People want answers to their questions,&quot; Clayton Cosgrove said. &quot;They want to know when they can rebuild their homes and they want to know when they can begin to rebuild their lives. While the release of the stage 2 geotechnical report has helped some residents living in areas moderately affected, residents in the worst affected areas know little more now than when the earthquake first hit.</p>
<p>&quot;Frustration is rising and I can fully understand why some residents are almost at their wits end. When the cameras rolled into town the Government was quick to promise it would do all it could to ensure that no one was worse off, yet many people are starting to feel that real progress has stalled while much of the second phase assistance provided by the Government has been woefully inadequate.</p>

<p>&quot;Enterprise North Canterbury, for example, sought $950,000 in Government funding to assist quake-affected Kaiapoi businesses,&quot; Clayton Cosgrove said. &quot;They got one part-time business recovery co-ordinator and $20,000 from a $100,000 fund to promote businesses in Canterbury, to be shared with the Canterbury Employers Chamber of Commerce who only got two full-time employees and $80,000 following a $3.1 million bid.</p>
<p>&quot;This will do little to promote businesses and get people back in their stores,&quot; Clayton Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>&quot;Residents have also expressed great concern over the Government&#39;s failure to signal any plans to provide temporary accommodation assistance for residents when their temporary accommodation private insurance cover runs out. For many residents this only lasts for 6 to 12 months so time is quickly running out.</p>
<p>&quot;These people have been through the mill and they deserve to know what, if any, assistance the government will provide if any. They are entitled to have some certainty heading into the Christmas period. The Government must signal what temporary accommodation assistance it plans to provide residents.</p>
<p>&quot;At last night&#39;s meeting residents asked for an invitation to be sent to Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee to attend the next round of public information meetings I&#39;m organising for early next year, and I have today formally invited him. Mr Brownlee has had an open invitation to attend any of my previous meetings, and I&#39;d welcome his attendance.&quot;</p>
<p>Clayton Cosgrove said he had organised four rounds of meetings since the earthquake to keep residents informed of progress and to receive their feedback on earthquake recovery efforts. The next round of meetings is likely to take place in February following the release of the stage 3 geo-tech report.</p>
