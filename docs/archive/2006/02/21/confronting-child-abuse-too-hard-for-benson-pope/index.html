<p>Judith Collins MP National Party Welfare Spokeswoman</p>
<p>21 February 2006</p>
<p>Confronting child abuse &#39;too hard&#39; for Benson-Pope</p>
<p>National Party Welfare spokeswoman Judith Collins says David Benson-Pope&#39;s ability to act as an effective advocate for vulnerable children has been severely compromised.</p>
<p>&quot;In Parliament today, Mr Benson-Pope has suggested that he will have no difficulty delivering speeches on the issues of child abuse and bullying in his role as Social Development Minister.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a fascinating development and I look forward to seeing how he reconciles the historic allegations made against him with his current role as a defender and protector of disadvantaged children.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that Helen Clark is prepared to tolerate this contradiction defies belief.</p>
<p>&quot;David Benson-Pope has said very little about the issues of child abuse outside of Parliament since police concluded there was a prima facie case against him in relation to historic assault allegations involving students.</p>
<p>&quot;And I note with interest his late withdrawal from the speaking list at last week&#39;s 10th Australasian Conference on Child Abuse and Neglect. One would have thought the Minister of Social Development would clear the decks to speak at a conference co-hosted by his own department.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the excuses, it&#39;s hard not to be suspicious about the real reasons for his withdrawal from that conference,&quot; says Ms Collins.</p>
