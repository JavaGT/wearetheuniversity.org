<p>Hon Bill English - National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>21 February 2006</p>
<p>Labour should listen to parents</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English, says Labour should yield to parent power and allow integrated schools to increase their rolls where there is sufficient demand.</p>
<p>His comments follow media reports that some integrated schools are turning away hundreds of students.</p>
<p>Mr English says Labour&#39;s policy to cap enrolments at integrated schools, unless they can prove there will be no impact on the rolls of state schools, is a violation of parental choice.</p>
<p>A recent survey carried out by the Maxim Institute found that 96% of parents wanted the right to choose their children&#39;s school.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether the school is state-run, run by a community-owned trust, or is an integrated or independent private school should not matter one bit. Parents will decide which one suits their children the best,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Some parents like integrated schools because they provide the kind of education or a set of values that they want for their children. Labour should allow sensible increases in rolls for integrated schools where there is strong parent demand.</p>
<p>&quot;But Labour reduces choice wherever it can - by capping integrated schools, by enforcing rigid zoning restrictions and by slapping independent schools with an arbitrary funding cap.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour cannot swim against the tide of parental opinion forever.&quot;</p>
