<p>CAB opening on campus a NZ first</p>
<p>A ground breaking partnership between the Citizens Advice Bureaux and Waikato University has resulted in New Zealand&#39;s first CAB office operating from a University campus.</p>
<p>&gt;From 22 February students, staff and the wider Hillcrest/Hamilton East community will have access to the full range of information services offered by the CAB, from the new office in the &#39;Cowshed&#39; building located off Knighton Road. Currently, the closest CAB is located on Victoria Street.</p>
<p>The idea was generated by a well-timed cup of coffee between Bethea Weir, the University&#39;s Group Manager of Student Support Services, and Gill Denny, a retired University staff member and long-time CAB volunteer. Knowing that the university often referred students to the CAB in town for information and advice on issues such as tenancy, consumer services and legal advice, the two women thought it would be good to have those services on campus.</p>
<p>&quot;The University is like a small town, it made sense that we should be able to offer such a valuable community service,&quot; said Bethea.</p>
<p>&quot;Having the CAB on campus is a great development, not only for our students and staff but for the whole community. Anyone can use the office, and it&#39;s now much easier to get to than going all the way in to town.&quot;</p>
<p>Bethea said the CAB organisation had been &quot;wonderfully supportive and enthusiastic&quot;.</p>
<p>The Waikato University office will be staffed by a volunteer base of 20 people, many of whom are retired university staff who want to keep a connection with the University. From July, student volunteers will be trained to work in the University CAB, a move Bethea hopes will make the office more accessible to some students and encourage a culture of volunteering.</p>
<p>The University CAB office is open from Wednesday 22 February, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 11am-2pm.</p>
