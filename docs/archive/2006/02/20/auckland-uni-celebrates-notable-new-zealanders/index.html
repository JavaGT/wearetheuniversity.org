<p>Biographical notes on 2006 Distinguished Alumni Award winners</p>
<p>Judith Aitken (Arts)<br>BA (1971)<br>Leading educationalist, Dr Judith Aitken, has had a distinguished career as a public servant, author and community worker.</p>
<p>She has been Chief Executive of the Ministry of Women’s Affairs (1988-91), where she provided strong leadership, and Chief Review Officer of the Education Review Office (1992-2000). Under her pioneering leadership, ERO reviews of schools became an accepted form of accountability, ensuring transparent, public and student-focused evaluation. The ERO report published in 1996 on the state of schooling in Mangere and Otara forced a response from the Ministry of Education and government that eventually led to the most successful school improvement initiative this country has seen.</p>
<p>Judith attended The University of Auckland from 1956-1958 and returned to complete her Bachelor of Arts in 1971. In 1959 she attended Auckland Secondary Teachers College. Later she went to Victoria University where she took a Masters in Public Policy and a PhD in Political Science.</p>
<p>In 1997 she was awarded the QSO for services to education and in 1999 she was made New Zealander of the Year by the National Business Review which described her as ‘the best thing in New Zealand education.’ Judith has also published extensively, A Woman’s Place: A Study of the Changing Roles of Women and Men in New Zealand (1975), being her first major publication.</p>
<p>David Baragwanath (Law)<br>LLB (1964)<br>The Honourable Justice David Baragwanath QC graduated from Auckland with a Bachelor of Laws in 1964, also receiving the Cleary Memorial Prize for the New Zealand law graduate presenting the greatest prospect of service through the legal profession.<br>David gained a Rhodes Scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, where he completed a Bachelor of Civil Law degree (first class) in 1966. He was granted a Fulbright Travel Award to the University of Virginia in 1983 to study freedom of information and an Inns of Court Fellowship (London) in 2004.</p>
<p>David became a partner in the law firm then called Meredith Connell &amp; Co, a barrister in 1977 and was made a silk in 1983. Since 1995 David has sat as a High Court Justice in the High Court and in Divisional Courts of Appeal and between 1996 and 2001 he was President of the New Zealand Law Commission. He has also been a part-time law lecturer in civil procedure and administrative law at The University of Auckland</p>
<p>He played a key part in radically altering the legal status of Maori in New Zealand through his work as senior counsel for the New Zealand Maori Council, and in securing a proper place for The Treaty of Waitangi in New Zealand’s constitutional and legal framework. He has also provided outstanding service to the university sector, notably in 1988 when he acted as senior counsel for the Universities of Auckland and Canterbury, which challenged Government restructuring proposals and thereby helped preserve university autonomy.</p>
<p>Philippa Boyens (Arts)<br>BA (1994)<br>Oscar winner, Philippa Boyens, is one of New Zealand’s most internationally respected screenwriters. She completed her Bachelor of Arts (majoring in English and History) at The University of Auckland in 1994, having studied part-time.</p>
<p>Philippa is best known as principal script-writer, along with Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson, for the screen adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is the largest film project to date ever undertaken in New Zealand. The script was honoured with an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay at the Academy Awards. In 2004 Philippa won an Oscar and a BAFTA for The Return of the King (Best Adapted Screenplay) and was nominated for both of these categories in 2002 for The Fellowship of the Ring. Her success in adapting Tolkien’s work to the screen has helped bring international recognition for the New Zealand film industry and New Zealand in general. The script has been honoured with multiple screenplay nominations in various international cinema awards. Philippa has more recently worked on Peter Jackson’s script for the much anticipated remake of King Kong released in December 2005.</p>
<p>Earlier in her career Philippa worked in theatre as a playwright, was a teacher, producer and editor, and was also the Director of the New Zealand Writer’s Guild. In 2000 she was named by Variety magazine in its list of Ten Best Writers to Watch.</p>

<p>Andrew Thomson (Medical and Health Sciences)<br>MBCHB (1988)<br>Medical humanitarian, aid worker, peace keeper, human rights investigator, activist and author, Dr Andrew Thomson is highly qualified to receive this award. Andrew’s desire to serve humanity through medical practice was nurtured by missionary parents.</p>
<p>Whilst a student at The University of Auckland’s School of Medicine from 1981 to 1987 he befriended a refugee doctor, one of about 60 doctors out of 600 who survived Pol Pot’s killing fields in Cambodia. After graduating first out of a class of 140 and working briefly at Auckland Hospital he went to Cambodia to work for the Red Cross. He then spent 13 years with the United Nations as a peacekeeper and medical doctor in Cambodia, Haiti, Rwanda and Bosnia where he documented and investigated war crimes including exhumation of mass graves, and regularly risked his life. He has made a positive contribution to conflict resolution and international war crimes prosecutions.</p>
<p>Andrew is co-author of the whistle-blowing book, Emergency Sex and Other Desperate Measures: A True Story from Hell on Earth, which recounts his professional life working for aid agencies. The book charges the UN with negligence, corruption and inadequate leadership and failure to prevent genocide. After the UN refused to renew his contract in 2004 it was pressured to do so by an international firm of lawyers. Andrew continues to work for the UN as Senior Medical Officer at its headquarters in New York.</p>

<p>Mark worked as an attorney in New York, and then as senior adviser to CEOs at a number of Fortune 500 companies for McKinsey &amp; Company.</p>
<p>Mark has been CEO of New Zealand Exchange since June 2002. In that time he has led it through its transformation into a mutual listed company, changed the exchange’s overall approach, and brought home the role and relevance of capital markets to New Zealand’s future to both the public and government. Mark’s leadership of the NZX has marked a turning point, creating investor confidence in the New Zealand market, and attracting both national and international buyers.</p>
<p>Mark swam for New Zealand at the Commonwealth Games in 1990 and at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games. He has recently joined the board of the New Zealand Olympic Committee, was an inaugural recipient of a Peter Blake Emerging Leader award, and is on the board of Springboard Trust which strives to improve capabilities of charities.</p>

From the middle of 2003, David worked with a broad group of business, community, and education leaders (including our former Vice-Chancellor, Dr John Hood and Distinguished Alumnus Chris Liddell) to set up the New Zealand Institute.</p>
<p>Since the public launch of the New Zealand Institute in July 2004, it has undertaken work on creating an ownership society, arguing for policies that encourage personal savings and asset ownership, and has recently launched a project that looks to increase the extent of international engagement of the New Zealand economy.
