<p>Anti-P march deserves nationwide support</p>
<p>National Party MP for Port Waikato Paul Hutchison says the anti-P march from Pukekohe, in his electorate, to Parliament should receive nationwide support and attention.</p>
<p>“The organisers of the campaign, some of whom have had family members suffer from P addiction, should be congratulated for bringing increased attention to a problem that affects every sector of our society,” says Dr Hutchison, who is also National’s spokesman for Policy on Children.</p>
<p>“As a former obstetrician, I have seen the frightening results this drug can have on young mothers and their children.</p>
<p>“The best way to fight the P scourge is for all sectors of the community to unite and rally behind those educating against it and those enforcing the law.</p>
<p>“One marcher told me of her son’s addiction, which began at the age of just 13. Pure methamphetamine is highly addictive and is associated with bizarre and unpredictable behaviour.”</p>
<p>Dr Hutchison says he will join numerous MPs in welcoming the hïkoi to Wellington and marching to Parliament on February 23.</p>
