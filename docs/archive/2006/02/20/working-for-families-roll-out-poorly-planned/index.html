<p><strong>Monday, 20 February 2006, 9:09 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Working For Families roll-out poorly planned</p>
<p>National Party Welfare spokeswoman Judith Collins says David Benson-Pope can no longer ignore the impact of the bureaucratic tangle being caused by Labour’s Working For Families welfare package.</p>
<p>“This package is causing major headaches for Work and Income staff. It was poorly planned and executed incompetently. David Benson-Pope has some urgent issues to deal with.”</p>
<p>Ms Collins is referring to a surge in resignations from the Work and Income office in Canterbury, and a leaked letter from staff to managers that says the Working For Families workload ‘has reached critical mass’.</p>
<p>“These resignations are placing extra pressure on existing staff, who are now carrying average Working For Families caseloads of almost 300 cases per staff member.</p>
<p>“When you’re juggling that many balls, sooner or later you’ll drop one or two.</p>
<p>“The Minister knew the numbers and he must’ve known Working for Families was going to cause a bureaucratic bottleneck.</p>
<p>“Mr Benson-Pope needs to tell us whether any planning was done at all to prepare for the extra workload caused by this Government policy?</p>
<p>“If the reaction of staff in the Canterbury region is any indication, the answer must surely be no,” says Ms Collins.</p>
