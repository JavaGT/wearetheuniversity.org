<p>Allied Staff @ Unitec To Take Industrial Action</p>
<p>Unitec’s allied staff TIASA Te Hononga, the union covering Allied Staff in Polytechnics and Wananga, and some universities, have voted overwhelmingly in favour of taking industrial action as a result of the approach taken by Unitec to their Collective Agreement negotiations.</p>
<p>Staff are outraged at what they consider to be an unreasonable and insulting offer of settlement by Unitec, and Unitec’s approach to the negotiations. Allied staff have been very supportive of Unitec over the last 15 months or so of financial difficulty. They took a low wage increase in last years Collective Agreement negotiations, and they have endured extensive reviews that have resulted in redundancies; increased workloads, and additional pressures and stress.</p>
<p>“Our members expected some acknowledgment and recognition of their endeavours, not the apparent dismissive approach by Unitec”, said TIASA Advocate, Shirley Walthew. Allied staff at Unitec are determined that they will not accept an offer of settlement that is significantly less than their Allied Staff counterparts throughout the tertiary sector , particularly in the Auckland region– nor will they accept conditions that undermine their current Collective Agreement”, she said.</p>
<p>In a further attempt to progress matters, Unitec have been asked to reconsider their position and to notify TIASA by midday, 21st February 2006 if there is any change. TIASA members will meet at that time to consider any such offer and, should a settlement not be available, will decide on the form and duration of their industrial action.</p>
