<p>Hon Bill English - National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>9 February 2006</p>
<p>Maharey must explain scholarship timing</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English says Education Minister Steve Maharey must explain why it is taking so long for scholarship exam results to be released.</p>
<p>The results are now scheduled to be released to students on February 23, almost one month later than NCEA results, despite the fact that the marking was completed in mid-January.</p>
<p>Mr English says that by the time students receive their results most will have started tertiary study.</p>
<p>&quot;Releasing exam results so late that they come out after students have made all their choices is nonsense. Being thorough is one thing, but this is beyond a joke.</p>
<p>&quot;After last year&#39;s mess, Labour is so paranoid about the results that they have forgotten about the students who should have had the results when making decisions about their futures.</p>
<p>&quot;We know the results are ready now because they were accidentally posted on NZQA&#39;s website last Saturday for a few hours.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr English says he looks forward to Mr Maharey&#39;s explanation as to why they are so late.</p>
