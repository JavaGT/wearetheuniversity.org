<p>Hon Bill English National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>7 February 2006</p>
<p>One zoning law for all?</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English, says Education Minister Steve Maharey must fess up as to whether or not he will continue to let Auckland Grammar School flout Labour&#39;s much-vaunted zoning laws.</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s school zoning policy promises that every child will have access to their local school, requiring schools to accept enrolments from all students legitimately resident in their zone.</p>
<p>At the weekend it was reported that Auckland Grammar has started turning students away even though they are legitimately resident in the zone.</p>
<p>Mr English says any number of schools would like to close their rolls so they control growth and manage their school better.</p>
<p>&quot;If Labour lets Auckland Grammar continue to flout the zoning policy they must allow other schools to do the same.</p>
<p>&quot;So far, all Mr Maharey has said is that the Ministry will look into the situation and deal with zone cheats. But Auckland Grammar&#39;s problem is not with zone cheats - they are turning away students with a legitimate right to attend the school.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents will be left floundering because they believed that because they paid the premium for houses in the zone, their children would be entitled to attend the school,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
