<p>The Future of Golf is here</p>
<p>Future Golf has arrived – and can be seen at AUT University’s Golf Swing Clinic’s new website.</p>
<p>The clinic’s website <a href="http://www.aut.ac.nz/golfswingclinichas">http://www.aut.ac.nz/golfswingclinichas</a> been launched to promote its unique facilities, programmes, assessments and knowledge base.</p>
<p>The Golf Swing Clinic, open since 2003, is part of AUT’s Sport and Fitness Centre based at its Akoranga Campus on Auckland’s North Shore.</p>
<p>AUT’s Sport and Fitness Centre Project Manager John Rice says the clinic’s main point of difference is its sport science focus.</p>
<p>“The clinic not only has a resident PGA coach, Rhys Ogden, it also draws on AUT’s Division of Sport and Recreation’s sports science experts, making it an exceptional golfing facility within New Zealand,” he says.</p>
<p>One of the clinic’s innovations is the Future Golf Workshop, which includes the “Golf Training Goggles System” – a unique innovation developed by AUT researchers. They took an Australian concept designed for rowers, and came up with golf-specific goggles.</p>
<p>“These goggles allow golfers to view their own movements in real time from any angle as they practise their swing,” says John.</p>
<p>The Future Golf package also includes biomechanical analysis, during which a player’s set up, back swing, swing path margin and body kinematics are recorded and studied.</p>
<p>Players also get the benefit of a musculoskeletal screening done by a sports physiotherapist to identify potential problems.</p>

<p>“These can be associated with a player’s posture, strength, flexibility and patterns of movement and may contribute to golfing injuries. By correcting these deficiencies their precision and performance will improve,” says John.</p>
<p>Workshop participants also receive a Pedar Golf assessment to look at pressure distribution during their golf swing.</p>
<p>The workshops are for individuals or groups of 10 or more. The clinic also offers more traditional golf tuition.</p>
