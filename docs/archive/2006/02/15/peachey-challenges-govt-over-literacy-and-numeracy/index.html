<p>Peachey challenges Govt over literacy and numeracy</p>
<p>National Party Associate Education spokesman Allan Peachey says the Government must take responsibility for the 150,000 New Zealand children who cannot read, write or do maths. Speaking in Parliament&#39;s debate on the Prime Minister&#39;s Statement, Mr Peachey said those young New Zealanders would be denied opportunities because of Labour&#39;s failure to address that very real problem.</p>
<p>&quot;We need national graduation standards in reading, writing and maths so everyone knows what we are aiming for and individual students&#39; problems can be identified and solved.&quot;</p>
<p>In 2003, the last time statistics were released, only 67% of primary schools participated in a reading recovery programme. Only about half of low decile schools participate.</p>
<p>Mr Peachey says this means the children who most need help with reading aren&#39;t getting it.</p>
<p>&quot;If only half of low decile schools use the reading recovery programme, then thousands of five and six-year-olds are missing their last chance to be caught in the safety net.</p>
<p>&quot;This kind of tolerated failure leads to a cycle of low expectations and dependency.&quot; During the election campaign, National campaigned to provide reading and maths vouchers for pupils who don&#39;t meet targeted standards by the age of seven to ensure they do not miss out.</p>
