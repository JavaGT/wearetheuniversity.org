<p><strong>Wednesday, 15 February 2006, 12:08 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Business_Roundtable">New Zealand Business Roundtable</a></strong></p>
<p>Submission on Budget Policy Statement 2006 Released</p>
<p>“The Business Roundtable is calling on the government to reconsider its spending programmes and tax policy, and to adopt a more pro-growth economic strategy”, the executive director of the New Zealand Business Roundtable, Roger Kerr, said today.</p>
<p>He was commenting on its submission on the Budget Policy Statement 2006 which was presented this morning to parliament’s Finance and Expenditure Committee.</p>
<p>Mr Kerr said the projections in the Budget Policy Statement for the growth of the economy in the five years to 2010 were clear evidence of a likely deterioration of economic performance, not the improvement the government was targeting. Accordingly, it should be open to a serious reconsideration of its growth strategy.</p>
<p>This should include its spending plans, which involved large ongoing increases in expenditure and poorly justified initiatives such as making student loans interest-free and the Working for Families package.</p>
<p>Government spending was taking a bigger bite out of the economy, putting pressure on the real exchange rate and internationally competing industries, and keeping taxes unnecessarily high.</p>
<p>Ever-increasing regulations were adding to problems of international competitiveness.</p>
<p>Mr Kerr said that the government’s review of business taxation was welcome but it should be undertaken speedily to improve incentives for investment and growth. There was no need for a protracted exercise given the comprehensive review of the tax system in 2001. The McLeod report’s key recommendation, the adoption of a lower and flatter income tax structure, with an alignment of the top personal and company tax rates, was supported by the Business Roundtable.</p>

<p>The Business Roundtable also favoured a better constitutional framework for fiscal and regulatory policies and advocated the inclusion of a Tax and Expenditure Limitation rule in the Public Finance Act and the adoption of a Regulatory Responsibility Act.</p>
<p>“Other business organisations have made similar submissions on this year’s Budget Policy Statement”, Mr Kerr said. “The government has said it wishes to have a better rapport with business, and we hope a more meaningful dialogue around fiscal strategy and growth issues will be initiated.”</p>
