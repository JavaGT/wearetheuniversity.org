<p>Media Release</p>
<p>17 February 2006</p>
<p>Criticism of Attendance Reward Another Education Beat-Up</p>
<p>New Zealand First Education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly has congratulated Wellington High School for its initiative in aiming to improve school attendance.</p>
<p>&#39;Opportunity to learn&#39; strongly influences student achievement and sustained truancy can lead to significantly diminished opportunities in later life.</p>
<p>&quot;By making these awards the school is proclaiming to its student body that attendance is important. Research on this issue is unequivocal - engaged academic learning time is a significant factor in learning outcomes,&quot; said Mr. Donnelly.</p>
<p>“In a country where (in September 2002) almost 12% of secondary school students were absent on any given day it is entirely appropriate that our schools focused their attentions upon this factor of engaged academic learning time,” said Mr Donnelly.</p>
<p>“Rather than beating up on Wellington High, we should be applauding its recognition of the importance of attendance and conveying this to its student body,” concluded Mr Donnelly.</p>
