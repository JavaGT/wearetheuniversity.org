<p>Avondale College&#39;s website initiative is great for families</p>
<p>&quot;Avondale College&#39;s initiative to provide a website where parents can access information on their child&#39;s academic performance, attendance and behaviour will help improve accountability between schools and parents&quot;, says Maxim Institute Policy Manager, Nicki Taylor.</p>
<p>&quot;Studies have shown that enabling parents to be more involved in their child&#39;s education can raise pupil performance. Soon to be launched, &quot;The Family Connection&quot; website will give Avondale parents more opportunity to become meaningfully engaged in their child&#39;s schooling experience&quot;, says Nicki Taylor.</p>
<p>&quot;Principal Brent Lewis&#39; motivation of pupils &quot;having their parents along for the ride&quot; is spot on. Moves to open up communication between parents, pupils and schools has got to be a good thing for all concerned&quot;, says Nicki Taylor.</p>
<p>Avondale College has found an innovative way of providing parents with much of the information they want - something the Ministry of Education is not doing as well - despite spending an estimated $54 million on providing information to parents in the 2004-2005 year.</p>
<p>&quot;The strong support from other principals and educators for Avondale College&#39;s website shows that schools are willing and able to respond to the wishes of parents. It will be exciting to see how other schools explore ways of opening up communication with parents and pupils, as improving accountability is vital across the board&quot;, says Nicki Taylor.</p>
