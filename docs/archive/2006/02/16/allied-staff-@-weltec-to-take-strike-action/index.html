<p>Allied Staff @ WelTec To Take Strike Action</p>
<p>WelTec staff, who are members of TIASA Te Hononga, the union covering Allied Staff in Polytechnics and Wananga, have voted overwhelmingly in favour of taking strike action as a result of a breakdown in their Collective Agreement negotiations with WelTec (Wellington).</p>
<p>“Allied staff at WelTec are determined that they will not accept an offer of settlement that is significantly less than their Allied Staff counterparts throughout the tertiary sector have received – nor will they accept conditions that undermine their current Collective Agreement”, said Terri Burling, TIASA Employment Relations Advisor.</p>
<p>“We have been in negotiations at WelTec since early December 2005 and WelTec’s apparent intransigence on a number of issues, has left TIASA members with no option but to take industrial action”, Terri Burling said.</p>
<p>“In a further attempt to progress matters, we asked WelTec to reconsider their position and to notify us by midday today if there was any change. An improved offer would have almost certainly averted the planned strike action. Unfortunately WelTec has not improved their offer and Industrial action by allied staff is now a certainty”, Terri Burling said.</p>
