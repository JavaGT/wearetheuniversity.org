<p><strong>Thursday, 16 February 2006, 9:28 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Party Pills Petition Goes Nationwide</p>
<p>Otago MP Jacqui Dean is confident a petition seeking legislative changes surrounding the sale and marketing of party pills revised will soon exceed 5000 signatures.</p>
<p>“What started out as a petition launched in Oamaru has now gone nationwide attracting widespread support from people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>“Their feedback strengthens my resolve to see changes made quickly in this area before buying party pills at a local dairy becomes as acceptable as buying an ice cream,” she said.</p>
<p>Around 4,200 signatures have been collected from as fair a field as Southland and the Coromandel. Mrs Dean is also due to speak at public meeting in Balclutha this week with colleague and Clutha-Southland MP Bill English following community concerns over the sale of party pills.</p>
<p>“It defies all logic that we are creating an environment that enables young people, children in some cases, to buy and use drugs we know so little about.</p>
<p>“What’s worse is these drugs are often cleverly marketed to young people as a precursor to much harder and more insidious forms of recreational drug taking,” Mrs Dean said.</p>
<p>Over recent months Mrs Dean has met with representatives from a range of organisations with an interest in the sale of party pills. This includes Social Tonics NZ, the Foundation for Alcohol and Drug Education and the NZ Drug Foundation.</p>
<p>Mrs Dean will present a petition to Parliament early next month seeking a review of the classification of party pills and for the review to encompass the health, psychological, social and community safety impacts of those substances.</p>
