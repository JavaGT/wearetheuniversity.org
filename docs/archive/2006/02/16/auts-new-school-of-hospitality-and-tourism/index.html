<p>Ideal blend for AUT&#39;s new School of Hospitality and Tourism</p>
<p>AUT University&#39;s new School of Hospitality and Tourism will be officially launched by Tourism Minister Damien O&#39;Connor today (Thursday, February 16). Guests, including celebrity chefs and industry representatives, not only get the chance to sample AUT&#39;s innovative hospitality at an evening cocktail function, they also get a glimpse behind the scenes * a tour of the kitchens to see the chefs in action.</p>
<p>The School of Hospitality and Tourism is the largest of its kind in New Zealand, with some 1100 EFTS and a staff of 60. It merges the former School of Hospitality and the Business Faculty&#39;s Tourism Academic Group. Courses range from certificate to PhD level, with flexible options such as an online masters programme.</p>
<p>The Pro-Vice Chancellor and Dean of the Faculty of Applied Humanities, Professor Rob Allen, says AUT has a strong tradition of supporting both the hospitality and tourism industries. &quot;Bringing them together under the new School of Hospitality and Tourism, linked to the internationally respected New Zealand Tourism Research Institute, provides a great opportunity to better serve the educational and research needs of one of New Zealand&#39;s most important business sectors.&quot;</p>
<p>The school&#39;s Associate Head (Academic), Dr Elizabeth Roberts, says it is a &quot;one-stop shop&quot; supplying the sector&#39;s employment needs. &quot;Tourism and hospitality is a leading industry for New Zealand and there is unprecedented demand for skilled staff, both here and overseas.</p>
<p>We are constantly working with industry to help meet those needs by delivering the appropriate skills, qualifications and research.&quot; AUT&#39;s Hospitality building on the corner of Mayoral Drive and Wellesley St has been refurbished to suit the new school&#39;s teaching and staff requirements.</p>
