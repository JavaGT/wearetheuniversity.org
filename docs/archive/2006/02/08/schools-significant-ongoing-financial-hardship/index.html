<p>Hon Bill English<br>National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>8 February 2006</p>
<p>Schools face significant, ongoing financial hardship</p>
<p>National’s Education spokesman, Bill English, says more than 200 schools will have started the year with significant financial problems.</p>
<p>Answers to parliamentary questions show that 199 schools are on financial watch because they have run deficits for the previous two years and remain in financial difficulty.</p>
<p>Mr English says this shows many schools are faced with significant, ongoing financial problems</p>
<p>The latest School Sector Report, released last year, shows that 42% of primary schools and 43% of secondary schools have operating deficits.</p>
<p>By the Ministry’s own standard, 15 primary and 9 secondary schools have ‘large’ deficits. Eighty-eight schools have deficits in excess of $100,000.</p>
<p>“It’s likely that many more schools’ finances will worsen this year as they face rising costs resulting from IT and support staff pay increases,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“Secondary schools will be hit particularly hard as they suffer the financial consequences of plummeting international student numbers and steadily increasing costs associated with NCEA.</p>
<p>“As the economy slows it is increasingly unlikely that schools’ operating budgets will be increased to a level that will ease their financial problems so, once again, parents and communities will be left to meet the shortfall.”</p>
<p>School sector statistics show that locally raised funds accounted for more than $500 million worth of school revenue in 2004.</p>
<p>The proportion of school revenue raised locally has increased every year that Labour has been in office. In 2004 primary schools raised an average of $473 per student in local funds, while secondary schools raised an average of $1,026 per student.</p>
