<p>Labour fails again on crime promise</p>
<p>The Labour Government is failing to live up to its promises to lower crime, says National&#39;s Law &amp; Order spokesman, Simon Power.</p>
<p>He is commenting on the 2005 crime statistics released today. They show:</p>
<p>· Violent crime up 6.9%, with grievous assaults up 13%, homicides up 27%, intimidation and threats up 11%, robberies up 12% and serious assaults up 7%. The resolution rate is down.<br>· Sex crimes up 6.4% and the resolution rate down to 54%.<br>· Burglaries up and the resolution rate down to a dismal 16%.<br>· Busts for new drugs, like &#39;P&#39;, up 29% last year and 179% since 2003.</p>
<p>Mr Power says that since 2000, violent crimes have increased by 16%, from 41,573 to 48,337 offences, and the increase last year is the biggest rise in any single year since 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;Grievous assaults are up 41.34% since 2000, with last year&#39;s increase of 13% the biggest single jump since 2000, and serious assaults are up 17.42% since 2000, with last year&#39;s increase the biggest in any year since 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;These figures make a joke of Labour&#39;s promises to reduce crime and its claims that it is on top of the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;And burglaries are up in the past year and the resolution rate is down almost to where it was in 2000, despite Labour&#39;s 1999 election pledge that they would reduce them.</p>
<p>&quot;This doesn&#39;t take into account the victims who are told by police to not bother reporting burglaries unless they need to do so for insurance purposes.</p>
<p>&quot;This is all about crimes against people, and it is clear from these figures that this Government is failing to deliver safer communities.&quot;<br>Mr Power says the Government should also be very concerned at crime rates in places like Counties-Manukau and Waikato, where total crime rose 11.8% and 8.1% respectively, and where resolution rates dropped.</p>
