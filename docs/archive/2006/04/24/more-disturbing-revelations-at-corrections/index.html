<p>More disturbing revelations at Corrections</p>
<p>Revelations that over the past four years the Corrections Department spent $31 million on consultants, at least one whom was a staff member it had just laid off, make it even more imperative there is a select committee inquiry, says National’s Law &amp; Order spokesman Simon Power.</p>
<p>He is commenting on a report on papers released under the Official Information Act which show that in the past year alone, spending on consultants increased from $5.7 million to $10.6 million.</p>
<p>The report also says the department laid off one staff member then rehired him as a consultant, though it was unable to say how much he had been paid.</p>
<p>“This is ludicrous,” says Mr Power. “There is some good money being spent on weird stuff. Some of this spending on consultancy is not explained well at all.</p>
<p>“They have spent $21,000 on something called ‘recall process training’, $119,000 on ‘professional ethics workshops’, $13,000 on a ‘Maori therapeutic programmes pilot’, $27,000 for an ‘audit of food’, $35,000 to a Canadian University for evaluations findings, and $25,700 for muster management tools.</p>
<p>“And there is a disturbing pattern emerging over the hiring of former staff as consultants.</p>
<p>“First we have the situation of a former prisons assistant general manager being hired as a consultant on $1,000 a day just two days after he resigned and without the job being put out to tender, and now we have someone else being rehired after the department laid him off.</p>
<p>“This department is in crisis, and is it any wonder when it displays completely inept management such as this.</p>
<p>“These revelations will give the public no reassurance at all that this department and its Minister know what they are doing.”</p>
