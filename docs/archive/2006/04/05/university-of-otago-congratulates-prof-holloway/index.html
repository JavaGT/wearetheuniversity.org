<p>University of Otago Congratulates Prof Holloway on National Appointment</p>
<p>The choice of Professor Linda Holloway as the next Chair of the National Health Committee is “an inspired one”, says University of Otago Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg.</p>
<p>“Prof Holloway is a highly experienced administrator, but she is also a respected medical academic and clinical pathologist with a deep understanding of the varied health issues confronting New Zealand today,” Professor Skegg says. “She brings to the position a sincere compassion for people, and an unswerving commitment to quality health care for all New Zealanders.”</p>
<p>Prof Skegg noted that during her time at the University – where she was Professor of Pathology and then Dean of the Wellington School of Medicine and Health Sciences before becoming the first woman to lead the University’s Division of Health Sciences – Prof Holloway was respected for her keen intelligence, her understanding of political issues, and especially her commitment to the welfare of individuals.</p>
<p>“I personally have the highest regard for Prof Holloway,” Prof Skegg continued. “She has served the University of Otago exceptionally well, and I am confident she will bring the same kind of dedication to her new role as Chair of the National Health Committee.”</p>
<p>Prof Holloway retired from the position of Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Health Sciences Division in February.</p>
