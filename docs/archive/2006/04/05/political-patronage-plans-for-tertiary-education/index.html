<p>Labour&#39;s Political Patronage Plans For Tertiary Education</p>
<p>Heather Roy<br>Tuesday, 4 April 2006<br>Press Releases - Tertiary Education</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s &quot;future directions&quot; for tertiary education funding, released today, will undermine the independence of universities, decrease competition and remove choice from students, says ACT MP Heather Roy.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s proposed changes, where tertiary funding would no longer be based on enrolment, would reduce choice for students and decrease quality&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;If carried through, these ideas would give Government iron-fisted control over which institutions and courses receive funding. Instead of choosing where to study, students will have to attend the Labour Party&#39;s favoured institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;Making tertiary institutions play up to politicians for funding undermines their ability to be the critic and conscience of society. Political patronage has no place in tertiary education.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no guarantee that politicians won&#39;t financially penalise courses which deviate from their ideology, or that political compliance won&#39;t be considered when deciding which institutions or courses are funded.</p>
<p>&quot;The quality of education providers won&#39;t be improved by politicians seizing more financial control. Universities, polytechnics and private training providers must be allowed to continue focusing on academic, rather than political, goals.</p>
<p>&quot;Students and their parents know better than politicians which degrees the job market demands, and choices about what and where to study should be left to them&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
