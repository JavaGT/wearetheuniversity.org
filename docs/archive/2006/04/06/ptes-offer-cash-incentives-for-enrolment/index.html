<p>PTEs offer cash incentives for enrolment</p>
<p>Some private training institutions (PTEs) are allegedly using the student loans scheme to provide cash incentives to boost enrolments, says National Associate Education spokeswoman Pansy Wong.</p>
<p>The PTEs appear to be offering cash-back rewards as high as $3,000 to migrant senior citizens as an incentive to draw down student loans from StudyLink to pay fees as high as $9,000.</p>
<p>Mrs Wong says she has received a number of complaints about the practice.</p>
<p>“These PTEs are targeting older people, particularly migrants seeking to learn English who are taking on heavy student loans without understanding exactly what the implications will be.”</p>
<p>The number of student loan applicants at PTEs over the age of 60 has more than doubled in the past year with total debt for over-60s standing at more than $85 million – most of which is unlikely to be repaid because people on pensions earn less than the $16,000 loan repayment threshold.</p>
<p>“The student loan scheme was designed to ensure meaningful tertiary education was available to everyone.</p>
<p>“The lack of action by Social Development Minister David Benson-Pope and his department on complaints received has allowed the problem to escalate,” says Mrs Wong.</p>
