<p><strong>Thursday, 6 April 2006, 10:42 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hodgson picks eyes out of survey</p>
<p>People will scoff at Health Minister Pete Hodgson’s claim that New Zealand has the second best health system in the world, says National Party Health spokesman Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>“Tell that to the 120,000 people waiting to see a specialist. Or the tens of thousands of people waiting months and months to get an operation,” says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>“Mr Hodgson makes himself look foolish. No one believes him.”</p>
<p>Mr Ryall is commenting on claims made by the Health Minister on the Commonwealth Fund survey of six countries, released today.</p>
<p>“If this were the second best health system in the world, would we have eight-year-olds who need life-saving brain surgery having their operations cancelled because there are too few nurses or operating theatres?</p>
<p>“Mr Hodgson makes no mention that New Zealand ranked last for effectiveness of the health system. Labour’s health system came last in prevention, chronic care, and hospital care and co-ordination.</p>
<p>“Not everything is bad with our health system. But not everything is as rosy as the Government would like us to think.</p>
<p>”Mr Hodgson himself gives the health system a five-and-a-half out of ten!</p>
<p>“Instead of crowing, he should deal with the crisis in elective surgery, the critical shortage of medical staff, and the problems with after-hours GP care. Those are the real issues affecting real people,” says Mr Ryall.</p>
