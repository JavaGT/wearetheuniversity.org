<p>Otago MP Jacqui Dean<br>Media Release<br>Thursday April 6th, 2006.</p>
<p>Dean Appalled at Party Pills Sales Tactics</p>
<p>Otago MP Jacqui Dean will make a complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority following the distribution of a flyer advertising herbal highs that she believes blatantly targets children.</p>
<p>The flyer features an ice cream truck marked “Mr Trippy” and was distributed by New Zealand Post in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin for Cosmic Corner stores.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Advertising Standards Board upheld a complaint lodged by Mrs Dean over a poster using the fictional children’s character Mr Potato Head to promote party pills. The poster was voluntarily withdrawn as a result of that complaint.</p>
<p>“The Mr Trippy campaign is worse than the Mr Potato Head posters. It’s using an edible product and linking that with party pills clearly targeting a younger age group than those legally allowed to buy the pills.</p>
<p>“This type of advertising pushes the legal limits of what is permissible under current legislation and needs reigned in,” she said.</p>
<p>Mrs Dean presented a petition to Parliament last month seeking changes in the way party pills are currently marketed.</p>
