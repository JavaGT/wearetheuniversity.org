<p>Hunt on for Massey Journalists</p>
<p>Wellington&#39;s School of Journalism at Massey University is on the hunt for old graduates.</p>
<p>The search is on to find up to 2000 journalists who trained at the school between 1966 and today.</p>
<p>They are wanted for the 40th anniversary celebrations of the school, the oldest surviving journalism training institution in the country.</p>
<p>Organiser Alan Samson says it&#39;s expected to be the biggest gathering of journalists the country&#39;s yet seen.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re very excited. We&#39;ve already had a huge response from all over the world. It&#39;s going to be a fantastic occasion.&quot;</p>
<p>The big celebration is set for Sunday June 4, Queen&#39;s Birthday, at Massey University&#39;s Wellington campus.</p>
<p>Many of New Zealand&#39;s prominent journalists started their careers here – including former broadcaster Judy Bailey, Fair Go&#39;s Kevin Milne, Investigate editor Ian Wishart, broadcaster Kerre Woodham, Morning Report&#39;s Sean Plunket, senior business reporter Fran O&#39;Sullivan, APN senior manager Rick Neville, Fairfax New Zealand senior manager Don Churchill and TV3 investigative reporter Melanie Reid. Alison McCulloch, part of a Denver Post Pulitzer prize-winning team for its coverage of the Columbine massacre, was also a graduate.</p>
<p>Fulltime courses started in 1966 when it was part of Wellington Polytechnic, although part-time courses actually started a couple of years earlier.</p>
<p>To celebrate, there&#39;ll be Sunday dinner at the Great Hall in the old Museum Building on Buckle St. (June 4), complete with an exciting international speaker, who will be announced shortly. Also there&#39;ll be a fun debate, and continuous journalism-related movies and documentaries. Participants from different years are encouraged to use the occasion as an excuse for organising their own reunions.</p>
