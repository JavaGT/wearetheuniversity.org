<p>AUT strengthens ties with Niue</p>
<p>Fakaalofa Lahi Atu and Pacific Greetings</p>
<p>AUT University’s ties with Niue have been strengthened with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the university and Niue’s National Training and Development Council (NTDC).</p>
<p>AUT Vice Chancellor Derek McCormack, the Director of AUT’s Office of Pacific Advancement Michael Jones, Niuean Minister Fisa Pihigia and the NTDC Manager Cherie Morris-Tafatu signed the memorandum at a ceremony at AUT on March 28.</p>
<p>Derek McCormack said the agreement was a significant step in AUT’s role in providing tertiary opportunities for the Niuean people. “As a public institution AUT must do as much as possible to engage with this important part of the Pacific community.”</p>
<p>Fisa Pihigia said Niue was steadily recovering from the devastation of Cyclone Heta two years ago – and AUT scholarship students were a crucial part of the rebuilding process. “The idea is that the students return to Niue to contribute with their education and expertise.”</p>
<p>Michael Jones said people affectionately referred to Niue as the “rock” of Polynesia as it was a fundamental part of the wider Pasifika community.</p>
<p>The tone of the occasion was set by a warm Niuean welcome followed by a Niuean hymn and a prayer by AUT staff members and Niuean Scholarship students.</p>
<p>Under the memorandum, AUT and the NTDC will develop educational opportunities to meet the needs of the Pasifika communities in Niue and Auckland.</p>
