<p>Double Cull: Patients struck off second waiting list</p>
<p>Thousands more sick patients are being quietly dumped from a second waiting list every month as the elective surgery crisis deepens, says National&#39;s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;The 8,100 people dumped from this second list are over and above the thousands removed from the separate list involved in the first cull - those referred to see a specialist.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ryall has released information from the Health Minister showing that more than 8,100 patients who have seen a specialist were dumped off surgery waiting lists and referred back to their GPs.</p>
<p>Health Minister Pete Hodgson admitted tonight that the numbers culled could in fact be much higher.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike those recently culled in Hawke&#39;s Bay, these patients have seen a specialist, and that specialist decided they needed an operation,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite a specialist saying they needed an operation, and would likely meet the points requirement, these patients are being culled because of a lack of funding.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the cruellest cut of all. These patients have survived the first cull, see a specialist, and find that surgery is needed, and then fall victim to the second cull.</p>
<p>&quot;DHBs have been quietly dumping thousands of patients off this second waiting list for the past year, including:</p>
<p>* Canterbury - 2,400 * Counties Manukau - 1,400 * Otago - 750 * Bay of Plenty - 630 * Nelson - 500</p>
<p>&quot;These patients were in the hospital booking system because a specialist said they warranted an operation. Sending them back to their GP is a false economy, because many of them will get sicker and sicker and then cost even more to treat.</p>

<p>&quot;What this is all about is trying to make the waiting lists look shorter so the Government can claim some pathetic credit. It&#39;s what the Government told several DHBs to do in a letter sent three weeks ago.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#39;s needed is a stronger focus on making the health dollar go further with less bureaucracy, supporting and involving the medical workforce, and greater co-operation between public and private services to get elective surgery waiting lists down.</p>
<p>&quot;Under Labour, it seems patients now have to be within sight of the pearly gates before they get elective surgery,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
