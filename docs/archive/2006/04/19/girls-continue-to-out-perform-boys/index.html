<p>Hon Bill English National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>19 April 2006</p>
<p>Girls continue to out-perform boys</p>
<p>NCEA results for 2005 show the gap between boys&#39; and girls&#39; achievement in the classroom is persisting, says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>He has today released figures showing that 14% more girls than boys passed NCEA literacy requirements last year, although the gap was smaller in numeracy.</p>
<p>In NCEA 2005, 20% more girls than boys gained University Entrance.</p>
<p>&quot;Education Minister Steve Maharey must front up to parents of boys and explain why he isn&#39;t taking this problem seriously,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is more concerned with making announcements than making progress - a leading school principal has today revealed that a reference group set up by Labour in 2004, with much fanfare, has been nothing but a useless talk shop.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr English says there are plenty of opportunities for improvement in boys&#39; achievement.</p>
<p>&quot;NCEA results show that boys attending single-sex schools achieve at similar levels to girls. Something about the culture and teaching practise in boys&#39; schools works and boys in co-ed schools could benefit from it.</p>
<p>&quot;We know what works and it is the Minister&#39;s job to provide the leadership to get more people doing it,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
