<p>Getting Skill Development Right a Vital Part of Building High Wage, Quality Economy says CTU</p>
<p>Getting the investment in skills development right is a vital part of building a high wage and quality economy, the Council of Trade Unions said today.</p>
<p>&quot;There is always competition for resources between not only different parts of the tertiary sector, but also different stakeholders,&quot; said Carol Beaumont, CTU Secretary. &quot;If funding is going to depend in part on an assessment of how relevant a course is to changing regional and national priorities, it will be vital to have widespread and ongoing consultation on this.&quot;</p>
<p>Unions will be actively involved in the consultation process on the changes to the tertiary system announced by Dr Cullen today, both until the consultation period formally ends on May 12, and beyond that date, Carol Beaumont said.</p>
<p>&quot;The ability of tertiary institutions to provide high quality, relevant courses is directly related to the funding support they receive. The CTU has consistently advocated the need to lift funding in tertiary education, including industry training and modern apprenticeships,&quot; said Carol Beaumont.</p>
