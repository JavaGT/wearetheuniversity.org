<p>Student demand for Victoria University grows</p>
<p>New Zealand students are flocking to Victoria University of Wellington—more than compensating for the slowdown in international enrolments. Domestic student enrolments have increased by 4 percent compared to the same time last year.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh, explained that the high quality of Victoria University’s programmes and the appeal of Wellington as a student-focussed city were an attractive package for students, particularly for those enrolling from the Auckland region.</p>
<p>“Victoria University strives for the highest standard of research-led teaching and we aspire to continuous improvement in the student experience,” he said. “This year we completed a $5 million upgrade of our student recreation centre and we will have invested $1.5 million more in our Library collections. A state-of-the-art student portal system is under development and we have recently commissioned our wireless network.”</p>
<p>Students readily found part-time or casual employment in Wellington he said. “The exciting, vibrant cultural and social life of the city provides our students with a much-needed change in pace from their studies.”</p>
<p>An analysis of student enrolments after the third week of lectures this year shows significant increases in nursing &amp; midwifery, chemical &amp; physical sciences, electronic &amp; computer system engineering, as well as history, philosophy and politics. “It is particularly pleasing to see a strong increase in demand for our long-standing film and theatre programmes, reinforcing the fact that Wellington is our creative Capital.&quot;</p>

<p>Professor Walsh said that a 9 percent decrease in international enrolments was anticipated, although a delayed start for some block courses has led to an increase in international enrolments since the report was prepared.</p>
<p>“We have seen an overall increase of more than 2 percent in total enrolments, which puts us right on track for achieving our strategic targets.</p>
<p>This year we will focus on encouraging the Government to increase its level of direct investment in New Zealand universities to enable us to continue to provide the quality higher education that New Zealanders deserve.”</p>
