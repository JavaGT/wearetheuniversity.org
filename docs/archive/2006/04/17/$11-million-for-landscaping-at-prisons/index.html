<p><strong>Monday, 17 April 2006, 12:26 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Simon Power National Party Law &amp; Order Spokesman</p>

<p>$11 million for landscaping at prisons</p>
<p>National&#39;s Law &amp; Order spokesman, Simon Power, says he is astounded that landscaping at New Zealand&#39;s four newest prisons will be more than $11 million.</p>
<p>He has released figures from Corrections Minister Damien O&#39;Connor which show that estimated landscaping costs at the prisons are:</p>
<p>* Spring Hill (Waikato): $4.34 million.<br>* Northland (Ngawha): $1.56 million.<br>* Auckland Women&#39;s: $1.98 million.<br>* Otago Region: $3.3 million.</p>
<p>&quot;I realise that some of the sites have to meet visual stipulations under the consent agreements to satisfy the local community, but that is a lot of plants, design work, planting, topsoil, pavement and bark.</p>
<p>&quot;And when you take into account that at three of the sites, prison labour made or will make &#39;a significant contribution&#39; to the landscaping work, including providing seedling stock, you have to wonder how much higher those costs could have been.</p>
<p>&quot;I also note there is no mention of consents in the answer for Spring Hill. Does this mean none were required, in which case why did they spend so much and where did that $4.3 million go? No wonder there is a constructions budget blowout of $490 million.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not meant to be creating outdoor works of art or serene walks around these prisons. These are meant to be places where inmates are reminded every day of why they are there. Taxpayers need to be assured they are not funding an entry for the Ellerslie Flower Show.</p>

<p>&quot;Under this Government, which has been caught taking prisoners to the beach, letting them watch R-rated movies, and giving them ice cream and steak for dinner, it just becomes easier and easier for prisoners. Now they are making sure they have a pleasant outlook as well.&quot;</p>
