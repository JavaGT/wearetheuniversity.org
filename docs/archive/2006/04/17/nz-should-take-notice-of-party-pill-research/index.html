<p>Jacqui Dean National MP for Otago</p>
<p>16 April 2006</p>
<p>NZ should take notice of party pill research</p>
<p>News that New Zealand research may lead to a complete ban on party bills containing benzylpiperazine (BZP) in Australia shows the urgent need to take the research seriously, says National MP Jacqui Dean.</p>
<p>The Melbourne Sun Herald reports that Australian authorities are deciding whether their key ingredients - BZP and trifluromethylpiperazine - should be banned. Some states including NSW and Queensland have already banned them but others have not.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a growing body of evidence - both anecdotal and science-based - that pills containing BZP and sold as party pills are causing serious side effects in people who take them particularly when taken with alcohol,&quot; says Mrs Dean.</p>
<p>&quot;They are marketed as a safe alternative to P, yet growing evidence is showing the effects to be unpredictable, with people as young as 12 years experiencing side effects like racing heart, palpitations and convulsions.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of concerns brought to me about the marketing and sale of party pills, I started a petition calling for further research and much tighter controls on the advertising and sale of party pills.</p>
<p>&quot;The petition of 7500 is with Parliament&#39;s Health Select Committee and I will be giving evidence to the committee.</p>
<p>&quot;Cabinet Minister Jim Anderton has sat on his hands for nearly a year while the evidence has mounted about the danger of these drugs.</p>
<p>&quot;I call on him to finally act and to actually do something about this growing problem,&quot; says Mrs Dean.</p>
