<p>Government&#39;s Sad Birthday Gift For Plunketline</p>
<p>Heather Roy<br>Tuesday, 11 April 2006<br>Press Releases - Health</p>
<p>Today marks Plunketline&#39;s twelfth anniversary, and hundreds of thousands of parents who&#39;ve called Plunket&#39;s helpline are hoping the service can continue, says ACT Health Spokesman, Heather Roy.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m sure that Kiwi parents who have used Plunketline would wish to join me in congratulating Plunket on a job exceptionally well done&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday was also the 25th anniversary of Plunket&#39;s car seat rental scheme - another excellent service, running alongside Plunket&#39;s traditional role of providing Well Child checks.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, the government has given Plunketline an unenviable birthday present this week, pulling the rug from under their feet and awarding its contract to another firm.</p>
<p>&quot;When I broke the news 18 months ago that Plunketline was to be merged into Healthline, I warned that Plunketline&#39;s unique character would be lost in the merger.</p>
<p>&quot;Sadly, I&#39;ve been proven right - the government set Plunketline up to fail.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents trust Plunket&#39;s well respected, valuable and hugely popular service. Plunket nurses provide high quality advice, with an extremely high satisfaction rate from parents.</p>
<p>&quot;One thing the government cannot steal from Plunketline is its unique brand, and Plunket has vowed to continue this well-respected service by finding sustainable funding.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT offers Plunket our support for this move, and will do whatever we can so that Plunketline will continue&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
