<p>Free Market Best for Energy Consumers, Generators and Environment</p>
<p>Rodney Hide Tuesday, 11 April 2006 Press Releases - Energy</p>
<p>A new book by two Victoria University researchers, criticising Labour&#39;s regulation of the electricity market, is being welcomed by ACT Leader Rodney Hide.</p>
<p>&quot;Once again, Labour&#39;s craving for a regulated market is being debunked&quot;, Mr Hide said.</p>
<p>&quot;The book, to be launched tomorrow, concludes that pro-market reforms provided greater security of supply than Labour&#39;s regulated energy environment.</p>
<p>&quot;Red tape and regulation, including the Resource Management Act, is preventing the construction of adequate energy infrastructure.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour knows we need to invest in infrastructure - letting Kiwis spend another winter under the threat of blackouts is intolerable.</p>
<p>&quot;What we need is more market and less government.</p>
<p>&quot;Reducing red tape would let construction of new generation get underway - ending our reliance on hydro power and fossil fuels.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT has promoted competitive supply and an unregulated electricity market since 1996. We still believe that a free market in energy would be best for consumers, generators and the environment.</p>
<p>&quot;As we head for another winter of power shortages, Labour has to decide - either turn the lights out on Kiwis or relax the red tape&quot;, Mr Hide said.</p>
