<p>Student scholarships support Māori research</p>
<p>Twelve Victoria University students engaged in Māori-related research have secured grants for ongoing study through the Tū Horomata Scholarship scheme.</p>
<p>Six students received a full Tū Horomata scholarship, sharing $75,000 for postgraduate Masters study, while another six shared $30,000 to study at honours or other postgraduate levels.</p>
<p>Announcing the scholarship recipients, Pro Vice-Chancellor (Māori), Professor Piri Sciascia, says scholarship nominations were received from all University faculties.</p>
<p>“The Tū Horomata targeted scholarships are for emerging researchers engaged in topics of relevance to Māori. Tū Horomata translates to pure or excellent - words that describe the intent and desired outcomes of these scholarships,” he says.</p>
<p>“Funding for the scholarships has been derived from the Tertiary Education Commission’s Māori and Pacific Peoples Special Supplementary Grant, designed to help retain and up skill Māori students.”</p>
<p>Professor Sciascia says the scholarships will strategically develop Māori research capacity and acknowledge and support students engaged in kaupapa Māori postgraduate research at Victoria.</p>
