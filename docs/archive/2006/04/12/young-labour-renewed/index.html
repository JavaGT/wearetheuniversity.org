<p>Young Labour Renewed</p>
<p>WELLINGTON – “A fresh face for Young Labour” is how Young Labour [YL] Spokesperson Jonathon Jones described the result of the organisation’s Annual Conference held last weekend.</p>
<p>Young Labour gathered in Wellington to determine its priorities over the next year and elect a new executive. Reaching beyond the main centres, the conference was attended by delegates from around the country including several representatives from Invercargill, New Plymouth and Hamilton.</p>
<p>“Over half of YL’s new executive committee are fresh faces as well”, says Jones, “which is great, it brings a lot of new ideas and energy to our organisation.”</p>
<p>The conference also celebrated the successes of the past year – including YL’s contribution to the 2005 General Election campaign victory and the No Interest on Student Loans Policy that was introduced on April 1st.</p>
<p>“In part, the no-interest policy was a recognition of the work Young Labour had being doing for a long time to raise awareness of the issue” said Jones. “It really shows the impact young people can have in politics.</p>
<p>The conference also formally agreed that Young Labour support the union-led campaign to abolish unfair youth rates; support the campaign to repeal Section 59 of the Crimes Act; and take steps to raise political awareness of the need to respond to climate change.</p>
<p>“For those who say we’re tired, this conference sends a message,” said Jones, “That they are just plain wrong. From out perspective, under a third term Labour-led government, political activism right now is youthful, energetic and diverse.</p>
