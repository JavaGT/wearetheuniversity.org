<p>Hon Tony Ryall National Party Health Spokesman</p>
<p>12 April 2006</p>
<p>Hodgson must explain</p>
<p>Health Minister Pete Hodgson must explain why Hawke&#39;s Bay District Health Board has been forced to dump 1,800 patients off its waiting lists to see a specialist, says National&#39;s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>The DHB&#39;s board members today voted in favour of a proposal that will result in around 1,800 people being told they won&#39;t see a specialist doctor at a Hawke&#39;s Bay DHB facility.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Hodgson must explain why this has happened. He needs to explain why the DHB was told to do this in the Government&#39;s recent letter to a number of DHBs around the country.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ryall says the Government has written to key DHBs berating their growing waiting lists and threatening to institute &#39;intensive monitoring&#39; regimes.</p>
<p>It was sent to Hawke&#39;s Bay DHB, along with Auckland, Waitemata, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, MidCentral, Capital and Coast, and Canterbury DHBs.</p>
<p>&quot;Patients in those other communities will be wondering who is next in the line-up to be culled.</p>
<p>&quot;We understand other DHBs are preparing to respond to Mr Hodgson&#39;s demands in a similar way to Hawke&#39;s Bay.</p>
<p>&quot;This shows how dishonest Labour is in claiming it is reducing waiting lists,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
