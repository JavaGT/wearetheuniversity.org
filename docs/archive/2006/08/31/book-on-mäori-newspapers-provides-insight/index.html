<p>Book on how Mäori newspapers provides new insight into Mäori-Päkehä relations</p>
<p>PALMERSTON NORTH - A new book by Mäori history lecturer Dr Lachy Paterson provides new insights into the views and attitudes of Mäori in the years following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
<p>Colonial Discourses: Niupepa Mäori 1855 – 1863 is the first book to examine Mäori language newspapers.</p>
<p>Dr Paterson says in 1855 most Mäori lived in a tribal setting exercising their chiefly rights guaranteed by the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
<p>“But their world was changing. Many Mäori had entered the market economy, most had converted to Christianity, many could read and write and some had sold land to the Government.</p>
<p>“These trends pleased the Government, which envisaged a New Zealand dominated by Europeans with the benefits of European civilisation extended to Mäori, elevating them socially and economically. They assumed that the two races would become ‘he iwi kotahi - one people’. ”</p>
<p>And he adds that the Government used its own newspaper Te Karere Mäori (the first Mäori language newspaper), to disseminate this message to Mäori.</p>
<p>“Other newspapers were published by government agents, evangelical Päkehä, the Wesleyan Church as well as the Kingitanga, which the government considered the rival Mäori government.</p>
<p>But while the newspapers were used for propaganda, they also provided a forum, with many Mäori debating the issues of the day.”</p>
<p>Dr Paterson says by examining this debate, the book is able to illuminate the whole colonial discourse between Mäori and Päkehä as it appeared in Mäori language newspapers.</p>

<p>“Although some historians have used the newspapers in their research, they are an under-utilised resource and valuable as a window on Mäori society in the 19th and early 20th century,” he says.</p>
<p>The book looks at an eight year span of the newspapers from January 1855 to September 1863, covering a vital period in Mäori-Päkehä relations, leading into the wars of the 1860s.</p>
<p>It is published by the Otago University Press and based on Dr Paterson’s PhD thesis.</p>
