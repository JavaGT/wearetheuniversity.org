<p>Rates Bill Puts New Zealanders First</p>
<p>Rodney Hide Wednesday, 16 August 2006 Press Releases - Local Government</p>
<p>Rodney Hide, promoter of a Bill to cap increases in local body rates, says ratepayers should be furious that New Zealand First seem set to deny the public a chance to make submissions by voting against his Bill next week.</p>
<p>&quot;An inquiry - favoured by New Zealand First - might help, but it is not before Parliament at the moment&quot;, Mr Hide said.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to give the public a chance to have their say now, rather than face another year of crippling rates rises.</p>
<p>&quot;We have an immediate opportunity to debate alternative ways of funding local government.</p>
<p>&quot;Capping rates increases would prevent central government from pushing tough issues off to councillors.</p>
<p>&quot;My proposal includes the ability for councils to get exemptions to the cap for particular projects - with infrastructure developments in mind.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not pretend that my Bill has all the answers, but it provides an opportunity for the public to have their say.</p>
<p>&quot;By denying ratepayers a chance to make submissions, New Zealand First are defying democracy and ignoring tens of thousands of people - especially pensioners and people on fixed incomes - who are crying out for rates reform.</p>
<p>&quot;In one week, Brian Donnelly and his colleagues will decide whether ratepayers have to face another round of rates hikes.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand First voted for a similar Bill in 2004 - all that has changed now are the baubles of office.</p>
<p>&quot;Members of Parliament should be bigger than party politics, and work together to put Kiwis first&quot;, Mr Hide said.</p>
