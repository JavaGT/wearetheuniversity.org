<p>Zoning rules encourage parents to cheat</p>
<p>Auckland Grammar’s eviction of 45 students for breaching zoning rules is proof of how far some parents are prepared to go to choose which school their children go to, says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>“Labour’s centrally imposed zoning rules are overly rigid and encourage parents to cheat the system.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents know better than anyone how much is at stake with their children&#39;s education. They will always put the needs of their children ahead of Labour&#39;s theoretical left-wing ideals.”</p>
<p>A survey last year found that 96% of parents wanted the right to choose which schools their children attend.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour reduces parental choice in education every time it has the chance. Rigid zoning restrictions are a serious obstacle to choice, as are school closures, school transport and the new barriers facing integrated schools,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“National recognises that parents should have choice where practical and that communities and schools should have more say around enrolment rules for their local schools.”</p>
