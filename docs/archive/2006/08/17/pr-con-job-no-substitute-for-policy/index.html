<p><strong>Thursday, 17 August 2006, 3:31 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Pansy Wong MP<br>National Party Associate Education Spokeswoman</p>
<p>17 August 2006</p>
<p>PR con-job no substitute for policy</p>
<p>National MP Pansy Wong says Labour’s hollow words will do nothing to enhance the $2 billion international education sector.</p>
<p>She is commenting on Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen’s announcement today of a new agenda for the industry which comprises four goals:</p>
<p>* New Zealand students will be equipped to thrive in an inter-connected world,<br>* Our education providers will be strengthened academically and financially through international links,<br>* International students will be enriched by their educational and living experiences in New Zealand,<br>* The direct economic and social benefits to New Zealand from international education activities must grow to their full potential.</p>
<p>“International education is New Zealand’s fourth largest export earner but all Labour can do is state the obvious and talk a load of fluff,” says Mrs Wong, who has responsibility for international education.</p>
<p>Dr Cullen also announced the reallocation of $1 million within the education levy fund into a new fund for promotion.</p>
<p>Mrs Wong says this will come at the expense of research and professional development.</p>
<p>“The re-allocation of these funds will do nothing to enhance student experience and strengthen the sector. It’s a PR con-job.</p>
<p>“Not only is Labour devoid of any new ideas for the sector, it is misleading over funding.</p>
<p>“Today’s hollow announcement is nothing but an insult to these students who broaden our youngsters’ international outlook and contribute financially to our schools and tertiary institutions,” says Mrs Wong.</p>
