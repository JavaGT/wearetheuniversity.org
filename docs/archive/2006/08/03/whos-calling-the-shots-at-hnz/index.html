<p><strong>Thursday, 3 August 2006, 11:22 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Phil Heatley MP National Party Housing Spokesman</p>
<p>3 August 2006</p>
<p>Who&#39;s calling the shots at HNZ?</p>
<p>&quot;Why won&#39;t Chris Carter admit that a review of inspection procedures has been launched at Housing New Zealand?&quot; asks National Party Housing spokesman Phil Heatley.</p>
<p>Mr Heatley is commenting on the news reports which followed revelations that the level of vandalism and damage done by state house tenants and their guests is up by 40% in the past year.</p>
<p>&quot;Chris Carter bluntly denied there was any issue with the level of damage when I asked him questions about it yesterday. But now it seems there is in fact a problem and HNZ is reviewing tenancy inspections.</p>
<p>&quot;Why couldn&#39;t the Minister admit yesterday he was taking my advice?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Heatley says there are 11,500 people on the HNZ waiting list.</p>
<p>&quot;There are thousands upon thousands of needy New Zealand families lined up for a state house. That needs to be made crystal clear to tenants who choose to abuse the privilege of taxpayer subsidised housing.</p>
<p>&quot;The number of HNZ properties has increased by 2% in the past year, yet the amount of damage being done by tenants and their guests has increased by almost 40%.</p>
<p>&quot;Meanwhile, landlords in the private sector are experiencing a decline in vandalism and damage.</p>
<p>&quot;As much as the Minister has tried to blur the issue, this damage is not maintenance, it is damage &#39;that is not the result of fair wear and tear ... but results from the action or inaction of a tenant or third party&#39;, according to HNZ&#39;s own definition.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Heatley is calling on the Minister to make the details of the review public, &quot;so we can see it has been thorough and robust rather than a once-over-lightly that provides a convenient excuse to get the issue out of the news headlines.&quot;</p>
