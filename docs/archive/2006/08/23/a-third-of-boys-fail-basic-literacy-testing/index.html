<p>Hon Bill English<br>National Party Education Spokesman</p>

<p>A third of boys fail basic literacy testing</p>
<p>Almost a third of boys leaving the school system do not have the option of further skills training because their literacy skills are so poor, says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>Mr English has today released an analysis of pass rates for NCEA level one literacy and numeracy standards, broken down by both sex and decile.</p>
<p>Across all schools, 31% of boys failed level 1 literacy credits.</p>
<p>&quot;Too many teenagers - both boys and girls - are not even making it to the starting blocks in the race for tertiary education or skills training,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>Increasingly, tertiary providers regard level 1 literacy credits as the minimum prerequisite for entry to pre-apprenticeship courses.</p>
<p>Mr English says the figures can&#39;t be used to judge whether a school is effective because no one knows what level the students were at when they arrived at secondary school.</p>
<p>&quot;Individual schools&#39; records show that significant numbers of students arrive at secondary school well below the expected level of competency in literacy, but there is no national picture.</p>
<p>&quot;Until there is, the Government cannot take systematic action to solve the literacy problem.</p>
<p>&quot;National would require schools to report progress of their students towards national literacy and numeracy standards.&quot;</p>
<p>Level 1 NCEA results in core literacy and numeracy requirements in 2005</p>
<p>Literacy<br>Numeracy<br>National Averages<br>Across all NZ schools 72.8 79.1<br>Male 68.4 78.0<br>Female 77.2 80.2<br>(8.8) (2.2)<br>Across all decile 1-3 schools 63.8 74.8<br>Male 58.4 73.6<br>Female 69.4 76.0<br>(11.0) (2.4)<br>Across all decile 1 schools 61.1 73.1<br>Male 54.9 70.2<br>Female 67.0 75.9<br>(12.1) (5.7)<br>Across all decile 2 schools 63.1 75.3<br>Male 58.8 75.0<br>Female 67.3 75.8<br>(8.5) (0.8)<br>Across all decile 3 schools 66.3 75.2<br>Male 60.2 74.3<br>Female 73.4 76.2<br>(13.4) (2.1)<br>Across all decile 4-7 76.2 83.1<br>Male 71.6 82.8<br>Female 80.5 83.4<br>(9.1) (1.4)<br>Across all decile 4 schools 72.0 80.6<br>Male 67.5 80.1<br>Female 76.3 80.3<br>(8.8) (0.2)<br>Across all decile 5 schools 74.6 80.5<br>Male 71.1 80.5<br>Female 78.4 80.5<br>(7.3) (0.0)<br>Across all decile 6 schools 78.0 87.1<br>Male 74.1 87.1<br>Female 81.5 87.0<br>(7.4) (0.1)<br>Across all decile 7 schools 79.7 84.2<br>Male 73.5 83.0<br>Female 85.0 85.3<br>(11.5) (2.3)<br>Across all decile 8-10 83.1 87.3<br>Male 77.9 84.4<br>Female 89.3 90.6<br>(11.4) (6.2)<br>Across all decile 8 schools 83.7 89.6<br>Male 81.5 90.3<br>Female 86.6 88.7<br>(5.1) (1.6)<br>Across all decile 9 schools 85.4 89.6<br>Male 82.4 89.6<br>Female 88.7 89.5<br>(6.3) (0.1)<br>Across all decile 10 schools 81.4 84.2<br>Male* 72.2 76.5<br>Female 91.3 92.6<br>(19.1) (16.1)<br>* The low level of achievement of decile 10 boys seems is explained mainly by the large numbers doing Cambridge exams.</p>
