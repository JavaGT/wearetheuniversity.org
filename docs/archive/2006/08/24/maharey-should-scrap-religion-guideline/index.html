<p>Hon Bill English National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>24 August 2006</p>
<p>Maharey should scrap religion guideline</p>
<p>The Education Minister should scrap his silly guideline on religious instruction in schools, says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>He is commenting on a Ministry of Education proposal that would see the guidelines on religious instruction change to an opt-in requirement, rather than opt-out as is the current rule.</p>
<p>Mr English says the change is unnecessary as there&#39;s no problem to fix.</p>
<p>&quot;Boards of Trustees should use their judgement, as they always have, to determine what&#39;s best for their students, and parents should be listened to if they believe there is any coercion.</p>
<p>&quot;Rules that might allow for Maori prayers but not Christian prayers are ridiculous.</p>
<p>&quot;The opt-in provision is impractical because it will require yet more permission slips that many families won&#39;t return.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents who worry about a prayer at assembly are overlooking the fact that children often hear, or take part in, karakia and religious waiata - neither of which cause any harm.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour should let people decide for themselves what they are comfortable with and drop this nit-picking, busybody attempt to tell them what to do,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
