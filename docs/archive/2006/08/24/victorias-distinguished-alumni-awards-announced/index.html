<p>Victoria’s Distinguished Alumni Awards announced</p>
<p>A cricketer, arts patron and businessman, CEO, Chief Judge, scientist, dancer/choreographer and President of the New Zealand Red Cross, are the seven inaugural winners of Victoria University of Wellington’s Distinguished Alumni Awards.</p>
<p>Following a call for nominations by alumni, Jeremy Coney, David Gascoigne, John Allen, Chief Judge Joseph Williams, Dr Richard Furneaux, Deirdre Tarrant and Jocelyn, Lady Keith are the first recipients of the awards.</p>
<p>Announcing the recipients, Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh, said each winner represented distinguished achievement in their field of endeavour.</p>
<p>“It is an honour to recognise these New Zealander graduates who have each gone on from their tertiary studies at Victoria University to excel in vastly different disciplines and careers. In doing so, they epitomise the Victoria graduate attributes of leadership, creative and critical thinking, and communication skills.</p>
<p>“It is appropriate that their peers and the University recognise their success and the outstanding contributions they’ve made to their community and country.”</p>
<p>The seven will be presented with their awards later this year at the University’s inaugural Annual Alumni Dinner, a black tie affair at the Wellington Town Hall on 12 October, principally supported by the Wellington City Council and The Dominion Post. Distinguished Alumni Awards will be made each year at the Annual Dinner.</p>
