<p><strong>Monday, 7 August 2006, 10:33 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Elections Draw Record Number Of Candidates</p>
<p>Nominations for the 2007 Otago University Students’ Association Executive closed today with a record 57 nominations having been received. “We set a target of 30+ candidates for this year’s elections” said OUSA President Paul Chong today. “But we left that target in the dust twenty candidates ago” he continued.</p>
<p>Mr Chong noted that OUSA made a huge effort this year to publicise the nominations to the student community. “Past experience shows that there is a correlation between the number and quality of candidates and voter turnout” he said. “I’m expecting a real jamboree of an election” said Chong.</p>
<p>This year’s nominations include seven presidential candidates. Those vying for the top job on campus include two incumbent Executive Officers, Michael Baker (General Representative) and Holly Lawford-Smith (Post-Graduate Representative) and former OUSA vice-president Renee Heal. Incumbent clubs representative, Honor Lanham, is the sole candidate for vice-president.</p>
<p>Voting for the 2007 student executive starts on 21 August and finishes at 4pm on 24 August. All voting will be online at <a href="http://www.elections.ousa.org.nz">www.elections.ousa.org.nz</a>, as has been the case for the past four years.</p>
