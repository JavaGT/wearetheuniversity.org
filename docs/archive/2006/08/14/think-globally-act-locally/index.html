<p>Think Globally, ACT Locally</p>
<p>Rodney Hide<br>Sunday, 13 August 2006<br>Speeches - Environment &amp; Conservation</p>
<p>Speech to Upper South Regional Conference, Elms Hotel, Christchurch.</p>
<p>It&#39;s good to be back in Christchurch. It&#39;s like coming home for me.</p>
<p>I grew up in Rangiora, North Canterbury. I studied ecology at Canterbury University. I lectured environmental science down the road, at Lincoln.</p>
<p>ACT has since become the only completely new party elected under MMP.</p>
<p>We have fought the battle of ideas, and had those ideas ignored, vilified and finally adopted by our political opponents.</p>
<p>But our challenge is not just to &#39;complete the circle&#39; started two decades ago.</p>
<p>We must lay the blueprint for a new, modern New Zealand.</p>
<p>A New Zealand worth leaving to future generations.</p>
<p>That means thinking - and acting - for the long term.</p>
<p>It means promoting enduring ideas.</p>
<p>I am proud to lead a party that believes in tolerance, diversity and personal freedom.</p>
<p>A party that believes in prosperity.</p>
<p>And that believes in making New Zealand a better place to raise our families.</p>
<p>We stand for a prosperous economy and a strong society.</p>
<p>We recognise that our quality of life matters, too.</p>
<p>New Zealand should be a beautiful country that everyone can enjoy.</p>
<p>But one party has politicised and come to dominate the environmental argument.</p>
<p>A handful of groups now control environmental protection, running the agenda and keeping others at arm&#39;s length.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a mistake.</p>
<p>ACT believes that every party needs to tackle environmental issues.</p>

<p>Every Kiwi needs to be aware.</p>
<p>New Zealand&#39;s biggest environmental crime has been locking ourselves into big government programs, while overlooking the steps that individuals can take.</p>
<p>Our experience with Muldoonism has shown us that big actions, by big government, lead to big disasters.</p>
<p>The environment of our country is too important for us to hand over responsibility to politicians and trust them to &quot;sort something out&quot;.</p>
<p>State monopolies didn&#39;t work for business. They aren&#39;t working for health. They won&#39;t work for the environment.</p>
<p>We need to let all our citizens get involved.</p>
<p>Encourage individuals, not government, to be &#39;hands-on&#39; environmentalists.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no bigger example of government interference than the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p>New Zealand&#39;s Kyoto compliance means little or nothing to the environment.</p>
<p>Our carbon emissions are less than a drop in the bucket. Global warming is more about politics and research dollars than sound science.</p>
<p>But Kyoto will cost Kiwis a billion dollars a year.</p>
<p>While they&#39;re thinking big, government has overlooked the small steps that people can take themselves.</p>
<p>Steps like having a fuel-efficient car.</p>
<p>In government, power is measured by the size of your Ministerial limo.</p>
<p>But people love seeing my little Smart car around Epsom.</p>
<p>They know their MP is thinking globally, and acting locally.</p>
<p>But when it comes to conservation, we let people do very little.</p>
<p>Thousands of Kiwis who care about our country want to make a difference.</p>
<p>Enjoying &#39;the great outdoors&#39; is our Kiwi pastime.</p>
<p>Yet our contribution to protecting it is limited to protesting and going to court.</p>
<p>ACT wants to encourage practical environmentalism.</p>
<p>We should accept that non-governmental organisations have a role in looking after our precious wildlife.</p>
<p>We could put our national parks into trusts for ordinary, caring New Zealanders to join and run.</p>
<p>We could reward Iwi and businesses that take greater care of their communities.</p>
<p>There is a place for the Department of Conservation, but it should work in partnership with local people who love the land.</p>
<p>Thanks to red tape, private conservation is endangered.</p>
<p>But it is not extinct.</p>
<p>We should learn from the Kiwi Recovery Programme. The Karori Wildlife Sanctuary. Christchurch&#39;s own Roger Beattie.</p>
<p>Roger Beattie is passionate about Canterbury&#39;s eastern buff weka.</p>
<p>He set up the mainland&#39;s first large predator-proof reserve in 1994.</p>
<p>Now he&#39;s trying to encourage other people to set up their own small predator-free enclosures to bring weka back to Christchurch.</p>
<p>Red tape makes it hard, but DOC makes it harder.</p>
<p>It took Roger two years to get his last permit to transport and hold weka.</p>
<p>And while DOC say they want to re-establish weka in Christchurch, they kill up to 400 a year on the Chatham Islands.</p>
<p>The know-how and technology to re-introduce weka to Canterbury is available. Those who want to bring in and breed weka need to be encouraged. They certainly don&#39;t need to be hampered and held up every step of the way by the same bureaucrats charged with caring for our rare and endangered species.</p>
<p>I get the feeling that DOC is scared of the competition. Given DOC&#39;s performance, they have every reason to be.</p>
<p>We should be supporting people like Roger Beattie in their private conservation efforts - not hindering them. Big State monopolies don&#39;t care for the planet - but people do.</p>
<p>Getting people involved in private conservation gives them an active role in looking after our country.</p>
<p>Where the State gets involved, it should focus on taking care of its core duties.</p>
<p>Like making sure that justice is done.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Fisheries works hard to stop illegal fishing in New Zealand waters. But, like the police, they do not have the resources they need.</p>
<p>We have a Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, supposedly to advocate for the environment in the political process.</p>
<p>Instead of reporting to Parliament as a whole, he often seems to be uncomfortably close to the Green Party.</p>
<p>We cannot allow such an important debate to be captured by any one party.</p>
<p>Or any one bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Especially when we have no shortage of advocates.</p>
<p>With our present Parliamentary Commissioner, Morgan Williams, retiring we should disband the office.</p>
<p>We have no need for it. It serves no useful purpose. We would be better off putting the funds into private conservation.</p>
<p>Government should focus on doing things well, instead of constantly searching for new areas where they can interfere.</p>
<p>Areas like access to water.</p>
<p>Here in Canterbury we have a problem with water.</p>
<p>Many people think the problem is that there isn&#39;t enough.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s the same with any commodity, in the absence of a system for pricing and ownership.</p>
<p>Why conserve water, when wasting it costs you nothing?</p>
<p>And Labour thinks they can legislate and regulate the problem away.</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s &quot;freshwater strategy&quot; is to have a &#39;leadership group&#39; of bureaucrats to &#39;identify&#39;, &#39;establish criteria&#39; and &#39;develop strategies&#39; over the next two years.</p>
<p>There is not a single definable action.</p>
<p>But their intention is clear. Central government will take control.</p>
<p>We know that nationalisation of natural resources leads to disaster.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe was an environmental wreck when communism fell apart.</p>
<p>The environment of North Korea is unable to support their citizens.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe&#39;s authoritarian government has turned a country once known as &quot;Africa&#39;s food basket&quot; into a basket case.</p>
<p>With the environment - as with business - central planning fails.</p>
<p>Labour should introduce choice and markets to Canterbury&#39;s water system.</p>
<p>Privately held, secure, tradable water rights would mean Kiwis controlling their own access to water.</p>
<p>People would have the incentives of a property owner to use, protect and conserve their asset.</p>
<p>It would be in your interest to conserve water - because it would be your water.</p>
<p>And if you had surplus, you could sell it to someone else.</p>
<p>The stunning thing is - this system isn&#39;t new.</p>
<p>It was used in Otago&#39;s gold fields.</p>
<p>It is used overseas.</p>
<p>It should be used here in Canterbury, and across New Zealand.</p>
<p>We are in ACT because we know that behaviour is better shaped by choice than by force.</p>
<p>Families and individuals make better choices than politicians and bureaucrats.</p>
<p>New Zealanders know we are confronted by serious environmental and conservation issues.</p>
<p>We want to preserve our country&#39;s beauty, and our quality of life.</p>
<p>But we cannot do that just with the blunt stick of law-making and regulation.</p>
<p>We need to let people make their own choices about how lightly they tread on the earth.</p>
<p>And we need to trust them.</p>
<p>That&#39;s the big difference between ACT and other political parties.</p>
<p>We trust the people.</p>
<p>New Zealanders love to travel, and we love our homecomings.</p>
<p>It is time to think globally, and ACT locally.</p>
