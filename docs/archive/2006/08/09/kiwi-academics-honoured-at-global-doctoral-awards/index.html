<p>Kiwi academics honoured at global doctoral awards</p>
<p>Two AUT University academics have gained top honours at the global 2006 Emerald/European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD) Awards.</p>
<p>Dr Mark Glynn and Associate Professor Dr Coral Ingley won awards for their Outstanding Doctoral Research.</p>
<p>A senior lecturer in marketing and advertising Dr Glynn won the top Marketing Strategy award for his research &quot;The Role of Brands in Manufacturer-Reseller Relationships&quot;.</p>
<p>His prize includes a research fund of more than $3000 and publication in the European Journal of Marketing. The category was judged by editors of the European Journal of Marketing and a panel of peers.</p>
<p>Dr Coral Ingley, Associate Professor in Management, received the Highly Commended Award in the Management and Governance category for her research &quot;From Conformance to Performance: The Strategic Role of the Board and Its Involvement in Corporate Leadership&quot;.</p>
<p>The category was judged by the editor of Management Decision and peers.</p>
<p>Emerald Group Publishing publishes the world&#39;s largest collection of international business and management journals. The EFMD boasts a global membership of more than 500 institutional members from academia, business and public services. The awards are the group&#39;s most prestigious accolades.</p>
<p>Emerald chief executive officer John Peters says the awards seek to encourage, celebrate and reward excellence in international management research.</p>
<p>&quot;We are proud to help reward and promote such high-quality research. The submissions from Dr Glynn and Associate Professor Coral Ingley are both outstanding pieces of research work and show great promise for future academic work.</p>
