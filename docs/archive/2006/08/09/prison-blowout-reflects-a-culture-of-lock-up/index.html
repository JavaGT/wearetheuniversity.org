<p>Prison Blowout Reflects a Culture of Lock Up</p>
<p>Dr Pita Sharples, Co-leader of the Maori Party<br>Wednesday 9 August 2006</p>
<p>The Maori Party today condemned the &#39;build more prisons, build &#39;em fast, and lock people up&#39; mentality, as reflected in the report of the State Services Commissioner into the Cost Escalation in the regional prisons.</p>
<p>&quot;Reading over the report made me extremely sad&quot; said Dr Sharples, Corrections spokesperson for the Maori Party. &quot;It&#39;s all there in black and white -there&#39;s been a massive 26% increase in the prison population in less than a decade. The prison population has shot up from original forecast of 6800 to the new figure of 8600&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;These are real people - with families, with children - and far too many of them are Maori&quot; said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>&quot;It is somewhat of a bitter irony that on this day, World Indigenous People&#39;s Day, we are reminded of the consequences of the burgeoning prison growth&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a grim reality, that although we are 15% of the New Zealand population, tangata whenua comprise 50% of the penal population; the disproportionate rate of incarceration being a feature of other indigenous populations across the globe&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The report makes it clear that the construction costs of the two new prisons arose from rising bed numbers, the demand to build prisons faster (the procurement methodology), and a &#39;heated&#39; construction market&quot; said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>&quot;But we all know the real heat in this project, was the unseemly haste and political pressure to build more jails and perpetuate a culture of lock-up&quot; said Dr Sharples.</p>

<p>&quot;Although the Minister was talking about not building &#39;more jails&#39; he forgot to mention that those he was currently building had got bigger, a clever bit of subterfuge&quot; said Dr Sharples. &quot;What has happened is not a blow-out - it is just a Minister omitting to tell us the real stories - his jails had increased in size. It was easier to make it look as if the &#39;bureaucrats&#39; had mucked it all up&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The consequences of this massive prison increase - are not just in budget blowouts. It has huge implications, socially, for thousands of families, tens of thousands of children; implications which extend far further than the $75,000* it costs to keep a person in jail each year&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Maori Party believes that the money should be better directed to the area of healing and restoration, to prevent people from ever going - or returning - to jail&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;In this light, I am pleased that the Corrections Chief Executive, Barry Matthews, is considering the model of rehabilitation I have put to him, which will make progress towards addressing recividivism&quot; ended Dr Sharples.</p>
