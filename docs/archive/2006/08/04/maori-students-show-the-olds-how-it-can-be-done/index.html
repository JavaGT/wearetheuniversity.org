<p>Maori Students Show the Olds How it can be done</p>
<p>A Rangatahi Business Competition held in Waikato last night has been promoted by Hone Harawira as the way to go.</p>
<p>The Rangatahi Business Competition was run by Te Ranga Ngaku, the Maori Management Student Network at the University of Waikato Management School for six schools within the Waikato rohe - Te Kura o Te Kaokaoroa o Patetere, Fraser High School, Fairfield College, Melville High School, Hillcrest High School and Cambridge High School.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve been hearing all these reports today about what a great night it was&quot; said Hone Harawira, Business and Employment spokesperson for the Maori Party.</p>
<p>&quot;Te Ranga Ngaku has a commitment to encouraging Maori students within the Waikato region&quot; said Mr Harawira. &quot;I understand they&#39;ve been working with the schools all year, helping to ensure their aspirations are set on high, that the world&#39;s their oyster&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s exactly the type of kick-ass attitude we want for our rangatahi - to know that business and enterprise are within their reach, that they can foot it in the business environment, and that their talents are what this country needs in our future&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;And in fact it&#39;s such a good idea, I&#39;m going to steal it and take it up North&quot; ended Hone Harawira, MP for Te Tai Tokerau.</p>
<p>Staff from the Maori Party met up with the mentors from Te Ranga Ngaku when they visited Parliament earlier this year, and have been watching their development with great interest.</p>
