<p><strong>Sunday, 20 August 2006, 5:42 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>King’s shameful legacy in oral health</p>
<p>National’s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall, says former Health Minister Annette King has left a shameful legacy of children with rotting teeth.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has been promising action on dental care for more than seven years. They&#39;ve even had a dental nurse as Minister of Health for six years, yet things have only got worse. Labour should be truly embarrassed.”</p>
<p>Mr Ryall is responding to comments by Health Minister Pete Hodgson today that attempt to justify a massive deterioration in children’s oral health since Labour came to power.</p>
<p>“Every single one of these five-year-olds was born under a Labour Government.</p>
<p>“Labour has promised action on children’s oral health since well before the 1999 election. They’ve had seven years in government to do something about it.</p>
<p>“Labour has no one to blame but themselves. During those seven years they have released report after strategy after vision – all built on waffle.</p>
<p>“The latest report calls for DHB plans by the end of next year! There is no sense of urgency or taking of responsibility.</p>
<p>“What is this Government waiting for? It’s time for Labour to stop counting the problem and stop blaming everyone else for seven years of inaction.”</p>
<p>The regions with the worst dental health in five-year-olds include Northland, Waikato, Tairawhiti, Whanganui, Bay of Plenty, Wairarapa and West Coast.</p>
