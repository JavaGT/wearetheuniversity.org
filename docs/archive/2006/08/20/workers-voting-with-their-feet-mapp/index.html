<p>Workers voting with their feet – Mapp</p>
<p>It’s hardly surprising that union membership is plummeting when unions are blatantly misusing their funds to promote the Labour Party, says National’s Industrial Relations spokesman, Wayne Mapp.</p>
<p>Figures released by the Victoria University Industrial Relations Centre show that union membership has dropped by almost 100,000 since 2000.</p>
<p>Dr Mapp says workers are voting with their feet because they are fed up with their union fees lining Labour Party coffers for no return.</p>
<p>An Investigate magazine report shows that the Service and Food Workers Union alone spent $237,000 working for Labour during the last election.</p>
<p>“The unions have also poured more than $100,000 into a deliberate misinformation campaign that totally distorts the issues around my Employment Relations (Probationary Employment) Amendment Bill. For example, the CTU has said the bill will lead to 89-day rolling contracts, which is absolute nonsense.</p>
<p>“I’m sure most union members would rather their union fees were spent serving workers than on this kind of illogical hysteria and blatant politicking.</p>
<p>“But when more than half of Labour MPs and the vast majority of Ministers are former union representatives, it’s hardly surprising they are in such cahoots.</p>
<p>“Workers are voting with their feet – abandoning unions in droves – but neither the unions nor their Labour Party masters will take much notice while they continue to benefit from a sweetheart deal that totally ignores the fact that 1.8 million New Zealanders have chosen not to belong to a union,” says Dr Mapp.</p>
