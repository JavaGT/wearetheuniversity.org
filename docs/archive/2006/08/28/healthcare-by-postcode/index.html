<p>Hon Tony Ryall National Party Health Spokesman</p>
<p>27 August 2006</p>
<p>Healthcare by postcode</p>
<p>National&#39;s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall, has labelled today&#39;s Government health announcement as &quot;healthcare by postcode&quot;.</p>
<p>He is commenting on an announcement today of increased funding for General Practices that charge very low fees in low-income areas.</p>
<p>&quot;This is healthcare by postcode,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;Under Labour, your address counts for more than how sick you are.</p>
<p>&quot;Beneficiaries or low-income workers in one part of a city will get more government help than even more needy people in another part of the same city. That&#39;s totally unfair.</p>
<p>&quot;The most pressing need in the health system is for more elective surgery. That&#39;s where National would put immediate emphasis. There are fewer elective operations today than six years ago but the population has grown and the need is great.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has totally overlooked the disconnect in its policy - they want more people to go to their GP when sick, but if they need an operation they can&#39;t get anywhere near a hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;The thousands of Kiwis who have been culled from the waiting list need a break - regardless of their postcode,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
