<p>Slippery slope of home lending</p>
<p>Banking expert Dr David Tripe will explore the potentially dangerous downstream impact of home lending, at a seminar in Wellington tomorrow (Wednesday).</p>
<p>He will look at the steady increase in banks&#39; lending on housing and how this relates to the balance of payments deficit and private sector foreign indebtedness.</p>
<p>Dr Tripe observes that the value of housing stock has risen substantially, accompanied by a very considerable growth in home lending, and explores where the money has come from to fund that lending. “Not from household savings – because there hasn’t been much of that. Instead banks have had to fund their lending from other sources, particularly from non-residents whose contribution to our economy has risen dramatically.”</p>
<p>He examines the relationship between that offshore contribution and the balance of payments deficit, noting that a major contributor to that deficit is the investment account. “And major components of that account are the servicing of debt to non-residents plus the profits of foreign-owned firms.”</p>
<p>Dr Tripe predicts what could happen if foreign investors become uncomfortable with their holdings of New Zealand dollars and exit, and if high household spending (rather than saving) continues.</p>
<p>“We could have a slowdown in our ability to absorb foreign funding of the banks (and so a slowdown in housing lending), and in foreign acquisitions of New Zealand businesses.”</p>
<p>Dr Tripe is Director of Massey University’s Centre for Banking Studies.</p>
<p>The forum will be held on Wednesday 16 August from 12.15 - 1.30 pm at the Museum Room, Turnbull House, Bowen St, Wellington.</p>
