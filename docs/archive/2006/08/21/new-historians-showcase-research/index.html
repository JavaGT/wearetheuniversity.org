<p>New historians showcase research</p>
<p>The development and impact of New Zealand’s liquor laws will be among the topics presented at a conference showcasing the work of postgraduate history students.</p>
<p>The ‘New Historians 2006’ conference, hosted at Victoria University on 1 - 2 September, will see current and recent Master’s and PhD students from Victoria and Waikato universities present a range of research topics.</p>
<p>Victoria University Associate Professor Melanie Nolan will introduce guest speakers, while Otago University Professor Tom Brooking and Canterbury University Associate Professor Phillipa Mein Smith will give opening and closing addresses respectively.</p>
<p>New Historians spokesperson, Victoria University Master’s student, Lisa Sacksen, says the conference resulted from discussions between history postgraduate students and Associate Professor Nolan about what assistance Victoria’s history programme could provide the students.</p>
<p>“We’re therefore delighted to be hosting this conference which is the first of its kind in New Zealand,” says Lisa.</p>
<p>“It’s designed to showcase the depth and vitality of history, while adding to the professional development of postgraduate students.”</p>
<p>Topics to be covered during the two-day sessions include patterns of Scottish and Irish immigration to New Zealand; the Jacobite rebellion in Scotland; the nature of the New Zealand War Cabinet in the Second World War; the religious aspects to the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft; communist organisations in New Zealand from the 1930s to 1990s; and Resistance Bookshops.</p>
<p>“It’s hoped the conference will develop into an ongoing community of postgraduate history scholars,” Lisa says.</p>
<p>The conference is being held in Victoria University’s Hunter Building. The public is very welcome to register to attend the Conference and further details on this and the conference schedule can found by emailing <a href="mailto:megan.simpson@vuw.ac.nz">megan.simpson@vuw.ac.nz</a></p>
