<p><strong>Monday, 21 August 2006, 3:44 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology">Auckland University of Technology</a></strong></p>
<p>AUT University&#39;s Business School undergraduate growth has bucked the national trend.</p>
<p>The university&#39;s Bachelor of Business (BBus) has experienced a significant increase in both domestic and international enrolments in 2006. Domestic growth is 15% and international growth is 14% and there are now 3300 students enrolled in the BBus.</p>
<p>The recent statistics are part of a six-year trend for AUT. Ministry of Education data shows between 2000 and 2005 the AUT Business School undergraduate enrolments increased by 103% against an average for all New Zealand business schools of 42%.</p>
<p>The Dean of Business, Professor Des Graydon says the growth is especially pleasing when indications are many other New Zealand business schools are experiencing declines in undergraduate student enrolments.</p>
<p>&quot;Students tell us they choose AUT business degrees because of the small classes which provide an active and challenging learning environment,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;They also appreciate our close links with business and the contact they have with academic staff.&quot;</p>
<p>The AUT Business School&#39;s postgraduate and MBA numbers are also up. Enrolments on the Master of Business, Master of Professional Business Studies and Bachelor of Business with Honours programmes have increased 40% from this time last year and MBA enrolments are up 35% from the start of 2006.</p>
<p>Associate Dean of postgraduate students, Dr Andy Godfrey says the postgraduate growth is coming from top level professionals as well as transfers from other institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;As many as 80% come from other universities – including a significant number from international universities such as Europe, Australia, South Africa and Asia – and more than 50% come from the work place,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re attracting people with excellent professional experience as well as strong academic qualifications. We have chartered accountants, finance and banking experts and tax managers, all from well-known organisations. That&#39;s where the growth is.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Godfrey says the people enrolling in postgraduate study want to move on in their careers.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#39;re looking at discipline-based postgraduate programmes to enable them to get ahead,&quot; he says. &quot;We take it seriously, so they take it seriously.&quot;</p>
