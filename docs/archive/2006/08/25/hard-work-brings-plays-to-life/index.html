<p>Hard work brings plays to life</p>
<p>Three Victoria University students have been hard at work crafting and shaping a season of short plays to be performed from September 6.</p>
<p>Moment / Gone – three plays now will be the culmination of weeks of intensive directing work for these THEA 304 Directing students. Each has chosen a short play and has been challenged to create fresh and exciting theatre. The season which runs between 6 September and 9 September will work as the major assessment for these students, as they see their visions being brought to life on stage.</p>
<p>The productions themselves are a diverse mix of drama, comedy and the avant-garde, with each exploring aspects of the immediate nature of life.</p>
<p>Time Flies written by David Ives and directed by Sarah Silver is a bright but fleeting comedy that follows two mayflies that must battle with frogs, love, life, death and David Attenborough.</p>
<p>Hypnagogis is a powerful drama written by Ken Hudson and is directed by Jo Bean. The play explores the lives of a number of individuals who are on different drugs. This not is not so much a play about drugs, but rather an intense investigation into the social consequences of lives lived in an altered state.</p>
<p>The final production on the triple-bill is Samuel Beckett’s Act Without Words: I. Beckett’s work has come to be recognised among the finest in avant-garde theatre with Act Without Words: I being no different. This comic mime follows the frustrations of a man stuck on stage with no way off. This challenging production is directed by Kevin Casey.</p>
<p>Student director Sarah Silver says the process is “fun, challenging and tiring, but I’m excited to see my work hit the stage in front of an audience”.</p>
<p>All three productions will be on offer as part of Moment / Gone – three plays now being performed at Studio 77, 77 Fairlie Terrace, Kelburn. Wednesday 6 – Saturday 9 September 2006. Shows start at 7pm each night with tickets $12 waged and $8 unwaged.</p>
