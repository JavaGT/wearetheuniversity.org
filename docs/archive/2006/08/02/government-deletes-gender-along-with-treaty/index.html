<p>Government Deletes Gender Along with Treaty from draft Curriculum</p>
<p>Te Ururoa Flavell, Education Spokesperson for the Maori Party Wednesday 2 August 2006</p>
<p>&quot;Kua tangohia a Hine ki waho a te Marautanga. He orite tenei mahi taurekareka, ki tera i mahia ki nga mätäpono o Te Tiriti o Waitangi. I tangohia e kuare&quot; ta te korero a Te Ururoa Flavell.</p>
<p>The Maori Party today continued its questions of the Government, about another set of deletions, this time pertaining to women.</p>
<p>Te Ururoa Flavell, Education Spokesperson for the Maori Party, asked questions in the House of the Minister of Women&#39;s Affairs, Hon. Lianne Dalziel. &quot;This Government is hell-bent on a path of destruction&quot; said Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>&quot;First we had the confiscation of all confiscations, with the Foreshore and Seabed legislation&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had apologies for confiscations, and the deceitful behaviour of the Crown in the treaty justice area&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Last week, we saw Labour cuddling up to NZ First by endorsing their actions to delete the Treaty principles from all legislation&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This week, that directive has taken seed in the books of our nations&#39; school rooms, by removing the Treaty from the principles and key areas of the new draft curriculum&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we have seen the hatchet has now fallen on our girls and boys - in the decision to remove any commitment to gender equity through the deletion of the &#39;gender inclusive curriculum&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;As a former teacher and Principal, I think it critical that the educational needs, experiences, interests and values of all students, both male and female, are explicitly covered for in all parts of our programme&quot;.</p>

<p>Questions Asked in the House of the Minister of Women&#39;s Affairs from Te Ururoa Flavell</p>
<p>* What advice was sought from her Ministry to permit the removal of the words, &#39;a gender inclusive curriculum - which acknowledges and includes the eduational needs and experiences of girls equally with those of boys&#39; from the new draft curriculum statement; or like the deletion of the Treaty of Waitangi, does she believe that &#39;not talking&#39; about the gender of Maori and non-Maori students enhances gender equity?</p>
