<p>Victoria wins the Joynt Scroll</p>
<p>The Victoria University of Wellington Debating Society has won the prestigious &quot;Joynt Scroll&quot; (the New Zealand Universities Prepared Debating Champs) , which concluded on Monday at the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>The Joynt Scroll, now in its 104th year, is New Zealand&#39;s second oldest sporting competition. The Victoria 3 team defeated Otago University in the Grand Final, held at the Sky City Convention Centre in front of a large audience, arguing successfully that the Maori Party was not good for New Zealand politics.</p>
<p>The Victoria team comprised first year law and politics student Hugh McCaffrey, second year law and politics student Polly Higbee, and fourth year commerce student Lewis Holden. Victoria has not won the Joynt Scroll since 2003, but has won it more times than any New Zealand university.</p>
<p>Christopher Bishop, the Vice-President of the Victoria Debating Society, said that the win was a continuation of Victoria&#39;s amazingly successful year in debating. In April, Victoria came 1st, 2nd and 3rd in the debating at the NZ University Games, and was 5th in the recent Australasian Intervarsity Debating Champs, held in Wellington. &quot;It&#39;s been a fantastic year, and winning back the Joynt Scroll has topped it off&quot;, said Mr Bishop. &quot;Victoria undoubtedly has the best university debaters in New Zealand&quot;, he concluded.</p>
<p>Victoria&#39;s domination was also reflected in the individual speaker prizes. Polly Higbee was named as the Best Speaker of the tournament, and Captain of the New Zealand Universities Prepared Debating Team. Michael Mabbett, a fifth year law student, was also named in the New Zealand team. Stephen Whittington, a second year law and latin student, was named as 1st reserve.</p>
<p>Joe Connell was named as the tournament&#39;s Best Adjudicator, and Lewis Holden won the Lord Bledisloe Award for Oratory.</p>
