<p>UC and CCE join forces to celebrate adult learning</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury and Christchurch College of Education have joined forces to celebrate Adult Learners&#39; Week on both sides of Ilam Road this year.</p>
<p>Adult Learners&#39; Week He Tangata Mātauranga, running 4 to 10 September, is a time to focus on and celebrate the efforts, achievements and contribution of adult learners, educators and providers. The theme of the week is “ Adult Learning: Changing Lives, Building Strong Communities — Akoranga Pakari Whakawhiti Oranga me te Hanga Hapori Pakari”.</p>
<p>UC and CCE have planned a programme of activities to celebrate the week, starting with a launch and blessing at 12.30pm on Monday 4 September, at The Family House — Te Whare Whanau on the University campus. CCE Principal Dr Graham Stoop as well as student representatives from UC and CCE will speak at the launch and staff and students are encouraged to go along to show their support for the week.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the programme is a discussion forum on the topic of preparation issues and options for entrance to university study for adult students. The forum on Thursday 7 September, from 1-2.30pm in the Coppertop room of the Commerce building, is open to all students and staff, as well as the local community.</p>
<p>Dr Marion Bowl, senior lecturer in adult and community education in UC Opportunity, is the guest speaker for the forum. Dr Bowl has more than 25 years experience developing and managing adult and community education initiatives in the UK and internationally. Joining Dr Bowl on the panel to lead the discussion at the forum will be Carolyn Ford (Student Services); John Cook, current UC adult student and mentor; and Julie Moon, a recent CCE graduate who gained her Diploma of Adult Teaching and Learning.</p>
