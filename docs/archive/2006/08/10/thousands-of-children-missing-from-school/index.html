<p>SOS Alert: Thousands of Children Missing From School</p>
<p>Te Ururoa Flavell; Education Spokesperson for the Maori Party</p>
<p>Thursday 10 August 2006</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s admission today, that there is a high number of inaccurate notifications of students not enrolled at a school reflects system failure at its very worst, said Te Ururoa Flavell, Education Spokesperson for the Maori Party.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister&#39;s confession that in 2005, around half of the 8000 non-enrolments notified to the Ministry of Education were wrong, doesn&#39;t give any parent confidence, that their precious child is in good hands&quot; said Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>&quot;Can parents have any faith in the education system when half of these students are unaccounted for?&quot; asked Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears &#39;the system&#39; has lost 4000 children of the nation, and no-one even bats an eyelid&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;National student numbers and electronic databases are all well and good&quot; he said, &quot;but what about a simple class register, teachers talking to families, incentives put in place for school communities to take responsibility for the children in their care&quot; said Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>&quot;The $5 million put aside for the ENROL database, might be much better spent on making schools places that students want to attend&quot; said Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>The Maori Party has been looking into the concerns currently raised by alternative education providers [separate release available].</p>
<p>&quot;Assigning a barcode to a child is only one aspect of a much bigger problem&quot; said Mr Flavell. &quot;The crunch issue is, why is it that so many students are leaving school in the first place - and then the problem is compounded by their non-attendance going unobserved&quot;.</p>

<p>Mr Flavell also noted the disproportionate number of Maori students who are being stood down (removal from school for a maximum of five days) or suspended (formally removed, until the Board of Trustees decides on an outcome).</p>
<p>&quot;In 2004, while 21% of the school population were Maori; they accounted for 41% of all stand-downs (8383) and 47% of all suspensions (2244)&quot; said Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder what genetic theory can arise to explain for this apparent crisis&quot; ended Mr Flavell. &quot;Or is the system prepared to accept this failure as well?&quot;</p>
