<p><strong>Thursday, 10 August 2006, 2:54 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Simon Power MP<br>National Party Law &amp; Order Spokesman</p>
<p>10 August 2006</p>
<p>Prison cost ‘estimates’ only available 20 months after construction began</p>
<p>National&#39;s Law &amp; Order spokesman Simon Power is staggered that the indicative cost for Spring Hill Prison was not known until June 21 this year, 20 months after earthworks began.</p>
<p>Similarly, the indicative cost for Otago Prison was only known on May 25, 17 months after physical work began in January 2005.</p>
<p>These and further damaging revelations are contained in the State Services Commission’s report on the blowout in prison construction costs, released yesterday.</p>
<p>“Unlike a traditional contract, the prisons were built without a fixed price from the beginning, under the unusual Collaborative Working Arrangements (CWAs) adopted by the Department,” says Mr Power.</p>
<p>“The report says that an estimate of costs (known as Target Outturn Costs) should have been calculated before construction began – any delay means contractors are paid based on their actual costs, without any assurance that they are reasonable.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only was the project steering group not being told what the agreed costs were until the last few months, but Cabinet was also in the dark.</p>
<p>&quot;The Corrections Department and the Minister kept asking Cabinet for more money, but Mr O’Connor’s colleagues were apparently unaware that the estimates they were being given weren&#39;t even based on agreed costs.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s spin has been that the blowout has been limited to $140 million for two prisons.</p>

<p>&quot;But the report actually shows that Cabinet was given a series of increasing estimates dating back to 2000, starting at $114 million for Spring Hill and $79 million for Otago.</p>
<p>By December last year they had approved $380 million and $218 million in funding for Spring Hill and Otago respectively, but even this was based on &#39;draft TOCs&#39; that were clearly not finalised until recently.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders deserve to know why such huge fiscal decisions were made on the basis of such shoddy information.</p>
<p>&quot;But this may not be the end. The report also says that under the CWA system, &#39;The actual costs are not known until the project is completed’, and those CWA Agreements are still &#39;being finalised&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is the Government still can&#39;t say how much these prisons will cost.”</p>
