<p>Old rivals meeting on and off the rugby field</p>
<p>PALMERSTON NORTH – Massey will next month host the second of the revived rugby matches between it and Lincoln University for the LA Brooks Cup.</p>
<p>The rivalry between the two former agricultural colleges in the form of a rugby game between students went into hiatus for nearly 40 years after being contested from 1952 to 1966.</p>
<p>Last year the Massey Ag XV ventured down to Lincoln University for the resurrection of the competition but lost the game 24-7. This year the team will be out to settle the score with the home ground advantage of the Sport and Rugby Institute on Saturday 2 September.</p>
<p>Apart from the LA Brooks Cup, named after the donor who was the mother of a former Lincoln student called Harold Brooks, the winning team also receives the Mog Shield, a wooden trophy bearing a remarkable resemblance to a toilet seat.</p>
<p>Massey Almuni Relations Manager Leanne Fecser says as well as the rugby match between students there will be an “old rivals” dinner at Wharerata on the Friday night.</p>
<p>“We’ve already had a lot of interest from former students and staff keen to come along and swap stories and rekindle the battles of the past,” Mrs Fecser says.<br>“No doubt some of the old players will have plenty of advice for the current crop.<br>“All past and present students, staff and supporters would be most welcome to come along and support Massey – sorry, both teams.”</p>
<p>In fact that was the case last year at Lincoln when some of the spectators, who were graduates of both Universities, found themselves with divided loyalties.</p>
<p>Lincoln’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Roger Field and his Massey counterpart Professor Judith Kinnear plan to attend both the dinner and the match, which kicks off at 2pm.</p>
