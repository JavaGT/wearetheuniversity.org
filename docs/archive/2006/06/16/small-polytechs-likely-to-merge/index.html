<p>Small polytechs likely to merge</p>
<p>Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen today signalled that small polytechs are likely to be merged as they face continued financial uncertainty, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>Dr Cullen was responding to questioning at select committee about the Government&#39;s expectation that up to 15 polytechnics will get into financial trouble in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Cullen said the possibility of polytechs merging remains an &#39;open question&#39; and he is more concerned about provision of learning than about the institutions,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“This is a sure sign he is looking seriously at mergers where smaller polytechs get into trouble.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, Dr Cullen quoted Wanganui as an example of a merger, but that has been a disaster, both for the polytech and for Wanganui.</p>
<p>&quot;The merger of Wanganui Polytech and UCOL in Palmerston North in 2001 has brought none of the expected financial benefits, and now student numbers are dropping.&quot;</p>
<p>New Zealand&#39;s smallest polytechs are Telford, Aoraki (Timaru), Northland, (Whangarei) Tairawhiti (Gisborne), NMIT (Nelson and Marlborough), Bay of Plenty (Tauranga), Waiariki (Rotorua), EIT (Hawke&#39;s Bay) Tai Poutini (South Westland), Whitireia (Porirua) and SIT (Invercargill).</p>
