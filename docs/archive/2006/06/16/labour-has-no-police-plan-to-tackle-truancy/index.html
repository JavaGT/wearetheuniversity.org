<p><strong>Friday, 16 June 2006, 4:28 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Simon Power National Party Law &amp; Order Spokesman</p>
<p>16 June 2006</p>
<p>Labour has no police plan to tackle truancy</p>
<p>National&#39;s Law &amp; Order spokesman, Simon Power, is concerned that the Government doesn&#39;t appear to have a national strategy for police to combat truancy.</p>
<p>He is releasing answers to a parliamentary question that shows police do not keep statistics for the number of truancy operations or the number of truants apprehended.</p>
<p>&quot;We know that police truancy operations are run on an occasional basis at the district level, and they are to be commended for that.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Government had a truancy policy for police, then they would have statistics on this and we would know how big the problem was and how effective police were.</p>
<p>&quot;The Police&#39;s National Youth Policing Plan 2005-2006 mentions &#39;truancy&#39; only once, and then only in a diagram listing risk factors for youth.</p>
<p>&quot;Any Government serious about tackling youth offending knows that the best way is to ensure, first and foremost, that kids get a good education. And the best way of ensuring that is to make sure they are at school.</p>
<p>&quot;Chief Youth Court Judge Andrew Becroft has made the point many times that education is the ultimate crime-fighting tool, and this is hardly surprising when we know that 52% of prisoners have no qualifications of any sort.</p>
<p>&quot;Judge Becroft, talking on the need for a national database to track truants, has also said: &#39;... while not every such person offends, all offenders come from that group&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite promising a national student database to combat truancy for three elections in a row, Labour still cannot tell us how many children are missing out on their best chance to escape a criminal life.</p>
<p>&quot;It is high time for the Government to live up to its 1999 and 2002 pledge card promises to crack down on youth crime.&quot;</p>
