<p>NZEI joins chorus of concern about ratemyteachers.com</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa, the primary teachers’ union, joins the chorus of concern about the newly-launched website, ratemyteachers.co.nz.</p>
<p>The web site encourages students to post anonymous ratings and comments about their teachers.</p>
<p>“There are already many processes in place for students who have concerns about their teachers. Parents and students are always encouraged to approach schools if there are issues,” says Lynne Bruce, National Secretary of NZEI.</p>
<p>“By encouraging students to make anonymous postings, it cuts out the dialogue. Instead of working towards a solution, students may post exaggerated or untrue comments about their teachers in a wide public forum, without moving the issue forward.</p>
<p>“NZEI will be supporting any members who believe they have suffered unfair publicity. We are currently examining legal options that might allow either action against the proprietors of the website, or action to have the web site closed down,” said Lynne Bruce.</p>
<p>The union worries that, if such web sites gain popularity, with negative postings becoming ubiquitous, it may well put off people joining the teaching profession.</p>
