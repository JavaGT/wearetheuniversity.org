<p>The Future of North Shore Schools: The IT Revolution</p>
<p>In the last two weeks I have been visiting North Shore primary, intermediate and secondary schools.</p>
<p>There are challenges facing each school but also an emerging teaching revolution built around IT.</p>
<p>North Shore has always been fortunate with the exceptional quality of the schools, particularly the teachers and the level of community support.</p>
<p>Innovative teachers are building an educational revolution. Computers have been in our schools for at least a decade – but the level and sophistication of IT is now enabling a dramatically new teaching approach, where the students have access to global knowledge and the teacher is the facilitator and guide for the students.</p>
<p>The community has had to provide the bulk of resources. If a school such as Murray’s Bay Intermediate School wants to ensure virtually every student has a computer (650 computers for 900 students) this can only come from the community. Ministry of Education funding does not stretch that far.</p>
<p>Of course one computer per student changes teaching – it is no longer a teacher, whiteboard and all the students listening attentively and taking notes. This is a big experiment and other schools are looking closely to see how it works out.</p>
<p>One of the highlights was the production by Hauraki School, “The Wizard of Oz”. It was truly superb for children aged eight to 11. There is no doubt that a greater level of interactive teaching over the last 15 years is leading to much more confident and articulate students.</p>

<p>It is increasingly evident in our sportspeople. We now expect our leading sportspeople to be confident in the public arena – the somewhat tongue tied New Zealander is a person of the past!</p>
<p>North Shore schools are typically decile ten schools. That actually means they get less money than decile one schools in poorer communities. This is a particular problem for primary schools where there is limited opportunity for overseas full fee-paying students. It means most primary schools still have a lot of prefabs, which are pretty hard to replace. The Ministry regards that prefabs are as good as permanent rooms. Of course this is a ridiculous proposition. Students and teachers should not have to put up with 20-year-old prefabs. This is a policy that must be changed so that schools can have the quality of buildings that the community and the school expect.</p>
<p>Rangitoto College had its fiftieth commemoration. Each of the principals has made an enormous contribution to the school. My colleague, Allan Peachey, was noted as having embarked upon a building programme that eliminated virtually all prefabs. Rangitoto is New Zealand’s largest secondary school – but it is absolutely one of the best; a real credit to the teachers, the students and the community.</p>
