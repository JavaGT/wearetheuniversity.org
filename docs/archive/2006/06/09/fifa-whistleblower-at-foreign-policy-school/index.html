<p>9 June 2006<br>FIFA Whistleblower to Speak at Foreign Policy School</p>
<p>Influence of big-money world of sport on global politics focus of Otago conference</p>
<p>Sport’s influence on foreign policy will be scrutinised by leading academics, a senior UN advisor close to Kofi Annan, and an award-winning journalist and documentary maker at the 41st University of Otago Foreign Policy School later this month.</p>
<p>The line-up of speakers for the conference entitled Sport &amp; Foreign Policy in a Globalizing World includes investigative reporter Andrew Jennings whose books on corruption in the Olympic movement have earned him a widespread following and notoriety.</p>
<p>His latest title Foul! blows the whistle on bribes, vote rigging and ticket scandals in FIFA, whose officials have tried to delay publication of the book.</p>
<p>Foreign Policy School co-directors Associate Professor Steven Jackson, from the School of Physical Education and Stephen Haigh from the Department of Political Studies say the topic reflects the way that the strong links between sport and state affairs are increasingly acknowledged by high-level policymakers in many governments.</p>
<p>“Sport is big business and the money it generates exerts a major influence in world politics,” says Assoc. Prof Jackson.</p>
<p>“Football World Cups, the Olympics and other sporting events that walk the world stage all become backdrops to high level bargaining and diplomacy. The money and therefore power generated by these events can’t be underestimated.</p>
<p>“Wars have started over football matches and many countries derive their national identity from their sporting teams. And then there are issues surrounding the way sportspeople have become commodities that are in demand. We only need to look at the way that New Zealand loses some of its best sailors and rugby players offshore to see that.”</p>
<p>The school will also examine the way smaller states are looking to exploit increasing economic and cultural globilisation by hosting significant ‘second-order’ events, such as the Rugby World Cup.</p>
<p>Assoc. Prof Jackson says the Foreign Policy School is fortunate to have attracted top quality international speakers to explore the way sport and state interests are converging.</p>
<p>Andrew Jennings will be joined by former Swiss President Adolf Ogi, who is now UN Special Adviser on Sport for Development and Peace, and a number of other international commentators who specialise in the economic and cultural dimensions of sport, its role in the spread of democracy, human rights and other ideals, and the foreign policy implications of its ever-expanding international presence.</p>
<p>The 41st University of Otago Foreign Policy School will run from Friday 23 June to Monday 26 June at Salmond Hall, Dunedin.</p>
