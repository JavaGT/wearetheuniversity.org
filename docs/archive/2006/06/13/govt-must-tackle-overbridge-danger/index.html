<p>Paul Hutchison National Party MP for Port Waikato</p>
<p>13 June 2006</p>
<p>Govt must tackle overbridge danger</p>
<p>The Government must act now to stop more deaths occurring as a result of objects being thrown off motorway overbridges on State Highway One, says the National MP for Port Waikato, Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;On Sunday night, my neighbour was driving along the motorway when his vehicle was struck by a heavy object which shattered the windscreen,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;The object was so large it could easily have caused his death. He was incredibly lucky to escape uninjured.</p>
<p>&quot;When he phoned the police they said a similar incident had been reported earlier that evening.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year, a man died due to the utter irresponsibility of a child on an overbridge hurling missiles onto the traffic below.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government must act immediately to better protect the public. While they continue to do nothing, people will be put in danger,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
