<p>Media Release<br>June 13, 2006<br>From NZEI Te Riu Roa<br>For Immediate Use</p>
<p>Schools Celebrate Vital Role of Support Staff</p>
<p>Tomorrow the country&#39;s schools celebrate Support Staff Day (Wed June 14) to highlight the vital role their support staff play in educating the country&#39;s children.</p>
<p>The event is organised by NZEI Te Riu Roa, which has more than 10,000 support staff members. The union estimates there are a total of around 27,000 support staff working in the country&#39;s 2579 schools. These include administrative staff, finance managers, teacher aides, technicians, librarians, caretakers, cleaners, kaiarahi i te reo (fluent Maori speakers) and health support workers such as therapists and nurses.</p>
<p>&quot;The posters for the Support Staff Day celebrations describe support staff as the key to a successful school,&quot; says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Irene Cooper. &quot;That sums up how important they are to every school in the country.&quot;</p>
<p>Schools rely on their support staff to carry out essential administrative work. To ensure every student receives a quality education, particularly those with special needs. And to ensure all schools are clean and well maintained.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the essential work they do, school support staff have little or no job security,&quot; says Irene Cooper. &quot;They also don&#39;t get paid during term breaks and are among the lowest paid workforces in the country, with pay rates that start at just $11.84 an hour.&quot;</p>
<p>This is because their jobs are bulk funded from each school&#39;s operations grant. Schools have to meet all their operating costs and pay their support staff from their grant. They struggle to do so and often have to cut a support staff workers&#39; hours, usually a teacher aide, to enable them to pay the schools&#39; bills.</p>

<p>&quot;Cutting a teacher aide&#39;s hours means cutting their pay and cutting the education programmes they help to deliver,&quot; says Irene Cooper. &quot;This is unfair on the teacher aide, the students and teachers they work with, and the board and principal who have been forced to take this action.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s clear bulk funding support staff salaries is failing. This is why NZEI is calling on the Government to establish a Ministerial Taskforce to develop a fairer and more effective funding system.</p>
<p>The union called for this in a submission to the education and science select committee in March. And again last month, when Budget 2006 included an increase in operations funding, but only enough to cover inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;Simply increasing operations funding will not solve the problem of paying support staff,&quot; says Irene Cooper. &quot;That&#39;s because they will still be competing with all the other costs, such as ICT, that schools have to meet from this bulk fund.&quot;</p>
<p>Irene Cooper says this is the message NZEI has given to the Ministry of Education&#39;s review of school operational funding, which includes an assessment of the current mechanism for funding support staff.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s encouraging that the School Trustees Association, the Principals Federation, the Secondary Principals Association, the PPTA, and other groups overseeing the review, recognise the need to address the funding issue,&quot; say Irene Cooper. &quot;But it&#39;s crucial that we move to the next step and start work on developing a fairer and more effective system for funding support staff.&quot;</p>
