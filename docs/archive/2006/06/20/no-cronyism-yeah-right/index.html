<p>Katherine Rich MP<br>National Party SOEs Spokeswoman<br>20 June 2006</p>
<p>No cronyism – yeah right</p>
<p>Trevor Mallard’s denial that state-owned enterprise boards aren’t weakened by cronyism was dealt a body blow today by findings of a Victoria University survey of SOE directors.</p>
<p>Dr Richard Norman, of Victoria University’s Management School, surveyed directors of nine SOEs. The directors were concerned appointments were being made for political or diversity reasons – not for their capabilities.</p>
<p>Dr Norman said: ‘Responses indicate the process for selection is too arbitrary, lacks adequate input from the chair and board, and is too heavily weighted towards political acceptability and correctness rather than capability.’</p>
<p>“That’s a polite way of saying boards are bogged down with party-friendly hacks who don’t have the business skills or judgment to make multimillion-dollar decisions,” says Mrs Rich.</p>
<p>“While SOEs Minister Trevor Mallard says he’s appointing good Labour Party people, clearly board members who sit around the board table with them don’t think so.</p>
<p>“He continues to bat away criticism of cronyism, but here it is confirmed in black and white by the SOE directors themselves.</p>
<p>“Perhaps he should start talking to his boards, and he might find out a thing or two about what the consequences of his cronyism is.</p>
<p>“One of National’s biggest concerns with Mr Mallard’s plan to expand SOE activities is whether they have the commercial aptitude to do so.</p>
<p>“We know Mr Mallard hasn’t, but to have directors themselves questioning the appointment process raises even more concerns.”</p>
