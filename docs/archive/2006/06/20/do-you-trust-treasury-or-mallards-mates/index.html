<p>Do You Trust Treasury, Or Mallard&#39;s Mates?</p>
<p>Heather Roy Tuesday, 20 June 2006 Press Releases - Economy</p>
<p>ACT MP Heather Roy is questioning why Treasury officials were forced to take a back seat to a union economist when Cabinet considered allowing State Owned Enterprises to invest outside their core areas of business.</p>
<p>&quot;Today in Parliament I asked why Peter Harris&#39; word was trusted over that of Treasury officials&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Harris - a well known PSA and CTU economist - was behind recommendations that SOEs should be able to invest outside their core areas of business.</p>
<p>&quot;SOEs are companies owned by government, and funded with taxpayer money.</p>
<p>&quot;Treasury was clearly concerned that SOEs had weak accountability disciplines, that Ministers with multiple objectives had difficulty selecting projects, and that money diverted by SOEs could provide a better return elsewhere.*</p>
<p>&quot;Treasury are our experts on fiscal policy. Mr Harris&#39; background reportedly includes the Labour Party&#39;s Policy Council, the Socialist Unity Party and Massey University.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet Trevor Mallard accepted the word of his comrade over the advice of officials.</p>
<p>&quot;If Government isn&#39;t going to listen to Treasury&#39;s advice, why do they even seek it?</p>
<p>&quot;The current Finance Minister, Michael Cullen, infamously said that Treasury speaks in &#39;ideological burps&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard may be trying to follow in Dr Cullen&#39;s footsteps, but his willingness to ignore Treasury advice is an example of why he should never be Minister of Finance.</p>
<p>&quot;Who should people trust - Treasury, or Trevor Mallard&#39;s union mates?&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>Peter Harris&#39; recommendations and Treasury&#39;s response are available at <a href="http://www.act.org.nz/advice">www.act.org.nz/advice</a>.</p>
