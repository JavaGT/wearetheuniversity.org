<p>Corrections staff pay rates out of kilter</p>
<p>The Corrections Department seems to have its priorities wrong when it comes to what it pays some staff, says National’s Law &amp; Order spokesman, Simon Power.</p>
<p>He is releasing answers to parliamentary questions that show the pay structures of two groups of staff responsible for prisons construction projects.</p>
<p>They show that 34% of the Regional Prisons Development Project team, which is responsible for building the four new prisons, are paid more than $90,000 each, while only 5% of the Assets and Property team, which builds cells at existing sites, are paid in that range.</p>
<p>In addition, 8% of RPDP team members get less than $40,000, while 33% of the Assets team are paid in that range.</p>
<p>“These numbers do seem way out of kilter with performance,” says Mr Power.</p>
<p>“The RPDP team is presiding over a construction budget blowout of $490 million, in which it is building cells at Otago Regional Prison, known locally as the Milton Hilton, for an average cost of $650,000 each.</p>
<p>“Compare that with the work of the Assets and Property team, which built new cells at Rimutaka Prison for an average of only $246,000, and you do begin to wonder who is producing better value for taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>“And don’t forget that the figures for the RPDP team don’t include the cost of private contractors, which we don’t know because Corrections Minister Damien O’Connor won’t tell us.</p>
<p>“What we do know is that the RPDP is being led by former Corrections employee John Hamilton, who is paid $1,800 a day.</p>
<p>“Let’s hope the State Services Commission’s review of the construction blowout can shed more light on exactly what is going on inside the Regional Prisons Development Project.”</p>
