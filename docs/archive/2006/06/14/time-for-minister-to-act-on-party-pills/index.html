<p>Jacqui Dean<br>National Party MP</p>

<p>Time for Minister to act on party pills</p>
<p>A survey showing that one in five young people have tried party pills should be the final wake-up call for Jim Anderton to act, says National MP Jacqui Dean.</p>
<p>She is commenting on the findings of a Massey University survey, which show that 38% of people aged 18 to 24 have used party pills in the past year.</p>
<p>Sixty per cent of those surveyed believe the present regulation of party pills is too light.</p>
<p>“This survey shows that now is the time to act,” says Mrs Dean.</p>
<p>“Doctors and police have been frustrated at the slow progress towards regulating party pills. Now it seems even users of party pills support tougher regulation.”</p>
<p>Associate Minister of Health Jim Anderton said yesterday he would refer the findings to the Expert Advisory Committee on Drugs for consideration.</p>
<p>“Mr Anderton is the Minister in charge of drug policy. It is he who needs to take responsibility. The problem is much bigger than we ever imagined.</p>
<p>“He has sat on his hands while the evidence has mounted about the danger of these drugs.</p>
<p>&quot;I call on him to do something about this widespread problem – and fast.”</p>
<p>Mrs Dean launched a petition last year calling for further research and much tighter controls on the advertising and sale of party pills. After gaining 7,500 signatures, the petition is now with Parliament&#39;s health select committee.</p>
