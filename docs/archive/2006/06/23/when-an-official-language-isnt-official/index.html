<p>When is an official language, not an official language?</p>
<p>Te Ururoa Flavell, Member of Parliament for Waiariki</p>
<p>Friday 23 June 2006</p>
<p>Recent discussions undertaken between Land Transport Safety Authority and a tiny kura in the heart of Ngati Pikiao rohe, Te Kura Kaupapa Maori O Rotoiti, make a mockery of New Zealand having declared te reo Maori an official language, says Waiariki Member of Parliament, Te Ururoa Flavell.</p>
<p>Almost ten years after former Minister of Education, Wyatt Creech, announced a primary school called Te Kura Kaupapa Maori O Rotoiti, and designated the school as a kura kaupapa Maori (5 July 1996) it would appear that the kura is now being constrained in actively promoting use of te reo Maori. &quot;The Act recognises te reo Maori in law and allows it to be used in the Courts&quot; said Mr Flavell. &quot;Yet in everyday signage, like the side of a school bus, a four-letter word (kura) is deemed illegal&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;When this small Rotoiti school was officiallly designated a kura, the official documents stated a goal being for the students to &quot;develop a high degree of pride and self-respect&quot;; and that every effort should be taken &quot;to ensure the survival of the Maori language and of tikanga Maori&quot;, in the long term aim &quot;to help students become confident bicultural and bilingual citizens&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I am outraged that our taonga, te reo Maori, is being treated with such disrespect&quot; said Mr Flavell. &quot;I have been told that when the Principal of the kura, Hawea Vercoe, contacted LTNZ, they advised him that if he wanted to add the word &#39;kura&#39; he would need to apply for an exemption, an exemption he was not likely to get&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;From my reading of the Land Transport rules - although the rules do not mention bilingual signs, they are not prohibited&quot; said Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>&quot;How on earth can we hope that our tamariki will become &#39;confident bicultural and bilingual citizens&#39; if te reo Maori is not able to be used as part of our every day language?&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I will be taking these issues up with the Minister of Transport&quot; concluded Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>Background Notes</p>
<p>Status of Te Reo Maori as an official language of New Zealand</p>
<p>In the 1986 Te Reo Maori Report the Waitangi Tribunal determined that the Maori language was a taonga and therefore had protection under the terms of the Treaty of Waitangi. This, in turn, led in August 1987 to the passing of the Maori Language Act which declared Maori an official language of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Colbert&#39;s Bus Service in Ruatoria used Maori names emblazoned on its buses, buses which transported students to Ngata Memorial College, Ruatoria from settlements like Waipiro Bay and Te Puia Springs and the outlying farming hinterland. This was in the 1950s before the Maori language was deemed &quot;official&quot; and they displayed the necessary &quot;school bus signage&quot;. The buses were named Atu, Apirana, Ngatiporou and Hikurangi. Hikurangi is still running. The reo was acceptable when not &quot;Official&quot; but now appears unacceptable when it is &quot;Official&quot;.</p>

<p>Together with the use of te reo Maori as the principal language of instruction, the following aims, purposes, and objectives constitute the character of Te Kura Kaupapa Maori O Rotoiti:</p>
