<p>ACC levy: part-timers all liars</p>
<p>National&#39;s ACC spokesman, Paul Hutchison, wants answers as to why ACC is charging a full-time ACC levy for people who list themselves as self-employed part-timers.</p>
<p>&quot;The ACC Helpline has said the charges are because part-timers are not telling the truth,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;Without any individual notification, ACC began automatically charging all self-employed part-timers at least the minimum full-time levy, irrespective of how much they may have earned - thus over-charging thousands of honest New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s no wonder New Zealanders are fed up with a Labour Government that introduces more than 40 new taxes in the past seven years, and now allows the ACC monopoly to sneakily invoice all self-employed part-timers for a full-time levy.</p>
<p>&quot;ACC has published a 2005/06 pamphlet titled &#39;Understanding your ACC Levies&#39;, which makes no mention of any distinction between full-time and part-time levies.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Hutchison says self-employed part-timers should be aware they are being over-charged by ACC.</p>
