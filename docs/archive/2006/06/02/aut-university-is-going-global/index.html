<p>AUT University is going global with its first international MBA programme to start in India this August.</p>
<p>A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed with the Centre for Developmental Education (CDE), an Indian non-profit educational society, in Bangalore last month.</p>
<p>AUT University&#39;s Business School will provide an 18-month fulltime and flexible MBA programme for working executives.</p>
<p>Faculty staff from AUT will teach the course in association with the Institute of Finance and International Management (IFIM), a Bangalore-based business school operated by CDE.</p>
<p>Minister of Trade and Foreign Affairs Trevor Mallard travelled to India with a New Zealand delegation to witness the MoU signing. This was the government&#39;s second mission to India to promote New Zealand international education and research.</p>
<p>AUT&#39;s Deputy Vice-Chancellor Philip Sallis and Dean of Business Professor Des Graydon signed the agreement with CDE.</p>
<p>Professor Graydon says India&#39;s growth in the education sector has been tremendous, but there are not enough institutes providing executive courses.</p>
<p>&quot;We have identified this gap and in collaboration with CDE will strive towards providing an excellent opportunity for pursuing a global MBA programme in India,&quot; he says.</p>
