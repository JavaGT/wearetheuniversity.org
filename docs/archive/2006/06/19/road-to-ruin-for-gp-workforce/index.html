<p>Hon Tony Ryall National Party Health Spokesman</p>

<p>Road to ruin for GP workforce</p>
<p>Kiwis could end up waiting for several days just to see a GP if the Government doesn&#39;t do more to recruit and retain family doctors, says National&#39;s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;Even worse, they may not even get onto a doctor&#39;s books.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ryall is commenting on a Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners report, which warns that increased support from the Government is essential to attract and retain rural GPs.</p>
<p>Mr Ryall is visiting Kapiti Coast today, where several hundred people are unable to enrol with a local GP because of a major shortage in the area.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is still all talk and no action.</p>
<p>&quot;After seven long years, they have run out of ideas in health. They&#39;ve had their turn, and it&#39;s time for a change.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Hodgson has New Zealand on the road to ruin when it comes to family doctor services.</p>
<p>&quot;At this rate we&#39;re going to end up like Britain, where patients wait days and days just to get an appointment with a GP. It is Tony Blair&#39;s dream for British patients to see a GP within two to three days. Do we want it to come to that here?</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is undermining the value and confidence of general practice. The attack on GPs&#39; freedom to set their own fees, the growing wave of bureaucracy, and the anti-GP flavour of the primary health care strategy all show Labour&#39;s true agenda.&quot;</p>
<p>At a medical education conference in Rotorua last month, Mr Ryall set out National&#39;s plans to boost GP training.</p>

<p>&quot;National will work with medical schools to boost training numbers, and significantly expand the amount of on-the-job experience trainee doctors get in rural and provincial areas. We will also encourage DHBs to offer student loan write-offs to those graduates who work in hard-to-staff areas. Lower taxes will also make general practice more attractive.</p>
<p>&quot;Most importantly, we will show through our actions that we genuinely value the input general practitioners can make to our goal of improved health services,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
