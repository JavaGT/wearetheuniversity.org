<p>Govt orders breast cancer patients to be culled from waiting lists</p>
<p>The Government-ordered waiting list cull will now force women cancer patients needing breast reconstruction to be dumped from hospital waiting lists, says National’s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>Women awaiting breast reconstruction following a mastectomy are being removed from waiting lists in response to the Government edict, which has already seen 20,000 patients culled from various hospital waiting lists.</p>
<p>“Already, breast cancer patients in Waikato and Christchurch have been dumped, with Auckland expected shortly,” says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>“The waiting list cull is completely out of control. These women are being denied what has become the accepted standard of care throughout the world.</p>
<p>“Who can believe that the Prime Minister is prepared to sit silently as this happens?</p>
<p>“Labour must withdraw its edict to cull waiting lists. The price is too high.</p>
<p>“Women who have had a breast removed have always been given the option of having a breast reconstruction after radiotherapy, or at some other time. Now they are losing that right as the Government forces specialists to cull them from waiting lists.</p>
<p>“It is likely these women will not receive a reconstruction at all.</p>
<p>”These are women who need to wait for a period of time after their mastectomy before having breast reconstruction. They generally have a more serious disease that requires them to have radiotherapy to the chest wall, and time is needed to allow for healing or to check that the cancer has not returned.</p>
<p>“Every day the waiting list crisis worsens, and the Government sits idly by as the suffering continues,” says Mr Ryall.</p>
