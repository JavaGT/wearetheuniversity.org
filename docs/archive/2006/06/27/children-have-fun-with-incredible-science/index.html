<p>Children have fun with Incredible Science</p>
<p>Children and their families will play with slime, come face to face with starfish and tie themselves in knots at next Monday’s Incredible Science day at The University of Auckland.</p>
<p>Incredible Science is an annual one-day event organised by the University’s Faculty of Science. It features scientific displays, lectures and interactive activities designed to help primary and intermediate school children discover science and highlight the fun and diversity the subject has to offer.</p>
<p>Schools and home-schooled students throughout Auckland have also been invited to design a science-related website, which will be submitted for judging on the day.</p>
<p>“Without science, and scientists, we would not have electricity, or be able to get on a plane to fly around the world,” says Professor Dick Bellamy, Dean of the Faculty of Science.</p>
<p>“Science is something we tend to take for granted, so it’s important that youngsters get involved as early as possible. It is of the utmost importance in our day to day lives and so we need to encourage the next generation to carry on the quest for new discoveries.”</p>
<p>Incredible Science takes place on Monday 3 July, from 9.30am to 3.30pm at the University’s city campus on Symonds Street. The event is free and there is no need to register. Children must be accompanied by a responsible adult at all times on University premises.</p>
<p>Programmes are available from the Call Centre on 0800 61 62 63.</p>
