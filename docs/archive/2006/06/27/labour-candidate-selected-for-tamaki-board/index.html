<p>Arna is excited about the chance to stand for Labour in the by-election for the Tamaki Community Board. &quot;I am interested in establishing stronger connections within different community groups and developing a safe and vibrant Tamaki community.</p>
<p>&quot;I am dedicated to the development of the Otahuhu recreation precinct in the Mason Ave Park and will work hard to ensure the swimming pool and the library are developed by the City Council as outlined in the draft Long Term Council Community Plan.&quot;</p>
