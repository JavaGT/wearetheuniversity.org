<p><strong>Thursday, 15 June 2006, 5:17 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Tony Ryall National Party Health Spokesman</p>
<p>14 June 2006</p>
<p>Strike will affect 20,000 patients, thousands more could be culled</p>
<p>Close to 20,000 patients will be affected by the junior doctors&#39; strike, with thousands more likely to be squeezed off hospital waiting lists as a result, says National&#39;s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Health Minister Pete Hodgson told Parliament that 10,000 patients would be affected. But a National Party survey of DHBs today shows that it is closer to 20,000 patients.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only will 20,000 patients have their care disrupted as hospitals close down services, others will find themselves culled from waiting lists altogether,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>In Parliament&#39;s health select committee today, Ministry of Health officials admitted there is a real risk the strike will see more patients culled from waiting lists.</p>
<p>&quot;The compounding effect of the strike means thousands of patients will be shuffled off waiting lists altogether as a result of the strike victims being booked back into the system. This will happen even if the strike is called off or shortened.</p>
<p>&quot;How, after seven long years, is 20,000 patients being mucked around still everyone else&#39;s responsibility but the Labour Government&#39;s?</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Hodgson said he had been briefed for months about the junior doctors&#39; negotiation, yet he&#39;s allowed it to get to this state.</p>
<p>&quot;He has done nothing to avoid disrupting the care of thousands of patients. Imagine being told you would have an operation, only to have your life disrupted by a strike that doesn&#39;t need to happen?</p>
<p>&quot;This is truly a crisis of Labour&#39;s own making,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
