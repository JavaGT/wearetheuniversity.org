<p>Power failure highlights grid&#39;s fragility</p>
<p><img src="http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/0606/c642860f88448f38b639.jpeg" alt="Provenco corp hurries together a generator solution.. just as the lights turn back on.">Today&#39;s massive power failure in Auckland and Hamilton shows just how fragile New Zealand&#39;s transmission system has become, says National&#39;s Energy spokesman Nick Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;Storms and accidents will inevitably knock down lines but the system should be designed and maintained to always have an alternative circuit available.</p>
<p>&quot;Overhead earthwires brought down by the weather caused Auckland to grind to a halt today. That&#39;s not good enough.</p>
<p>&quot;Consulting engineer Bryan Leyland has blamed a lack of investment in the grid for the problem, and pointed out Auckland&#39;s vulnerability.</p>
<p>&quot;Engineers have been warning the Government for years that the level of investment in transmission has not been sufficient to keep up with growth, particularly in the upper North Island.</p>
<p>&quot;Meridian Energy chief executive Keith Turner said in February last year that &#39;New Zealand&#39;s electricity grid is so overworked that some lines cannot be taken out of action for servicing. That is unheard of in the Western developed world.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;The cost of this electricity failure will amount to tens of millions of dollars for the Auckland economy - as well as the human cost of delayed medical operations, lost schooling and personal inconvenience,&quot; says Dr Smith.</p>

<p>&quot;This is a warning shot that Auckland&#39;s electricity infrastructure is nearly as bad as its roads.</p>
<p>&quot;Can the Energy Minister reassure the public of Auckland that this won&#39;t happen again?</p>
<p>&quot;The system should be able to cope with a storm of this sort and National will be following the issue up with more questions about not only went wrong, but why there were no backup systems in place.&quot;</p>
