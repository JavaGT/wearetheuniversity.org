<p>Sandra Goudie MP<br>National Party Internal Affairs Spokeswoman</p>
<p>7 December 2006</p>
<p>Minister buys time to clean up bad news report on gambling</p>
<p>National Party Internal Affairs spokeswoman Sandra Goudie says Damien O&#39;Connor should drop the cynical delaying tactics he&#39;s employing to limit scrutiny of a damning report on the provision of problem gambling services.</p>
<p>&quot;This report will be bad news for Mr O&#39;Connor and his Ministry. It will show they&#39;ve known about overpayments and under-delivery for some time, but done nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Goudie is commenting on Mr O&#39;Connor&#39;s statement yesterday that a report into problem gambling won&#39;t be released until next year, after he promised it in November. He has also admitted he already has the document and the Ministry has more work to do.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect that Mr O&#39;Connor is buying himself some time to try to sweep the serious problems within his department under the carpet.</p>
<p>&quot;He wants to be able to tell the public he&#39;s fixed the problem, knowing full well that potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars was being spent on services with few clients.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s inevitable this report will show an appalling lack of financial oversight and contract planning by his ministry.&quot; Ms Goudie says.</p>
<p>&quot;Damien O&#39;Connor should release the report now and face the music.&quot;</p>
