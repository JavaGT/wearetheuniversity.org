<p>Appointment of WITT Commissioner “almost inevitable”</p>
<p>The President of ASTE, the union representing academic staff at the Western Institute of Technology in Taranaki (WITT) said today that the situation at WITT had become so difficult that the appointment of a commissioner was almost inevitable.</p>
<p>Lloyd Woods said “This is the first time that a commissioner has been appointed to any tertiary institution and we applaud the courage and common sense of the current council (that will be disestablished) in realising that the situation would be best dealt with in this way and by approaching the Minister to have an appointment made”.</p>
<p>Mr Woods went on to say that WITT had been struggling for some years following loans in support of ill conceived ventures by previous management and councils. He added “Staff at WITT feel this is a positive move and one that shows an ongoing concern for and commitment to the Institution by the Government. We see this as a move in support of current management, staff and most importantly to students. Prospective students can have faith in the future of WITT and look forward to the continuation of the provision of high quality tertiary education for the people of Taranaki”.</p>
<p>In response to questions about how the staff feel Mr Woods said “It is all business as usual for academic staff. Our members have supported both the Institution and students to the hilt and this will not change”.</p>
