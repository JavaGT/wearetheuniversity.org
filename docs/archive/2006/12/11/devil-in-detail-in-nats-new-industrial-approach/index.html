<p>Devil In Detail In Nats’ New Industrial Relations Approach</p>
<p>“The devil is in the detail in industrial relations, and the CTU will be interested to explore with John Key his new approach to it,” CTU president Ross Wilson said today.</p>
<p>National Party leader John Key was today reported as saying New Zealand&#39;s industrial relations legislation is reasonable and a future National government would not plan any major changes to it.</p>
<p>“I must admit to being surprised with John Key’s remarks,” Ross Wilson said.</p>
<p>“This year the National Party championed a bill that would have exposed hundreds of thousands of workers to unfair sacking in the first 90 days on the job, and they have previously wanted to abolish time and half for working on public holidays, put the fourth week of annual leave up for sale and do away with workplace health and safety reps.”</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s future economic and social development is dependant on a stable industrial relations framework and recognition of the essential role of collective bargaining and the need for wages to rise.”</p>
<p>“If the National Party leader has come around to this view, all well and good.”</p>
<p>“Our challenge to John Key is that the wider package of laws governing our workplace relations should also remain intact, including the national social insurance scheme for workplace injuries provided for in ACC, the role of health and safety reps and Holidays Act protections for workers,” Ross Wilson said.</p>
