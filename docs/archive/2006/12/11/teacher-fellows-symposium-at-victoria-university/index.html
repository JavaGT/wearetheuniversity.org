<p><strong>Monday, 11 December 2006, 11:22 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Teacher Fellows Symposium at Victoria University</p>
<p>What does Sustainable Energy Generation in Taranaki have in common with Coastal processes in Tasman Bay and the Ko Nga Maunga nga Poupou? They are research projects for three of the fifty-four Teacher Fellows in 2007.</p>
<p>From 10-12 December the sixty-three Teacher Fellows from 2006 will attend a three day symposium at Victoria University where they will meet, share their experiences and pass on their wisdom to the 2007 incoming fellows. All one hundred and seventeen fellows will be addressed at the symposium by Labour MP Maryan Street.</p>
<p>The Teacher Fellowship scheme was first established in 1994 and since that date there have been over 400 Teacher Fellows who, to qualify for the scheme, must be practicing teachers in either a primary, intermediate or secondary school.</p>
<p>Each year there are up to 60 Teacher Fellowships awarded. Next year&#39;s Teacher Fellows, hailing from Balclutha to Botany Downs, are listed below.</p>
<p>The main objective of the Teacher Fellowship scheme is to enhance teachers understanding of science, mathematics, social science or technology and thereby improve the delivery of these programmes in schools. Teachers apply to the scheme by stating their intended programme and host organisation. Fellowships are awarded for between one to four consecutive school terms.</p>
<p>When the year is over the Teacher Fellows return to the classroom – invigorated, inspired and up-skilled – and their students and colleagues also become beneficiaries of the scheme. Applications are now being invited for the 2008 Teacher Fellowships.</p>
