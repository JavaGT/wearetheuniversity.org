<p>Spare A Thought Today For Those At Work</p>
<p>&quot;While most of us are enjoying time with friends and families today, let&#39;s spare a thought for those at work on Christmas Day today and during the New Year holidays,&quot; said CTU president Ross Wilson.</p>
<p>&quot;Many thousands of workers like those in emergency services, health and transport are at work over the summer break, providing essential services for the rest of the country.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The time-and-a-half payment and a lieu-day for people working on public holidays is a small acknowledgement that these days are important social and family occasions and that a sacrifice is being made by those who work,&quot; Ross Wilson said.</p>
<p>&quot;Unions are proud to have led the campaign for better recognition of workers who are required to be at work during these days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Holidays Act requires a bit of minimal fairness in encouraging employers to give staff the day off, or paying them more if they can&#39;t. Despite some protests from business interests, this is a small recognition to those who continue to be at work today and during other public holidays,&quot; Ross Wilson said.</p>
