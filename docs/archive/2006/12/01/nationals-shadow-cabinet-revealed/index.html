<p><strong>Friday, 1 December 2006, 12:30 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>

<p>1 December 2006</p>
<p>National’s Shadow Cabinet revealed</p>
<p>National Party Leader John Key has announced a reshuffled portfolio lineup that will form the foundation of National’s team heading into the next election.</p>
<p>A highlight of the reshuffle is the replacement of the front bench group with a Shadow Cabinet that comprises the first 16 portfolio holders.</p>
<p>“We think it’s a Shadow Cabinet that can earn the respect of New Zealanders,” says Mr Key. “In the run-up to the next election, the Shadow Cabinet will lead National’s work in developing and refining its policies.”</p>
<p>Bill English has been elevated to the Deputy Leadership and the Finance portfolio. Katherine Rich will take over Education portfolio and move up one spot to No 8.</p>
<p>“Katherine has real ability and this move allows her to take on the challenge of tackling a major portfolio,” says Mr Key.</p>
<p>Gerry Brownlee will have a number of responsibilities including being Shadow Leader of the House and chairing National’s Strategy Committee. He also gets responsibility for Energy, State Owned Enterprises and State Services.</p>
<p>Simon Power is promoted from No 7 to No 4 and gets Justice and Commerce. He retains Corrections. Judith Collins and Tony Ryall retain their existing portfolios, and Mrs Collins moves up one spot.</p>
<p>Georgina te Heuheu and Tau Henare take joint responsibility for the Maori Affairs portfolio. Mrs te Heuheu will become Maori Affairs (Culture &amp; Development) spokeswoman while Mr Henare becomes the Maori Affairs (Education &amp; TPK) spokesman.</p>

<p>“Georgina and Tau will work in concert, playing to their respective strengths as they hold the Government to account and deepen and broaden National’s relationship with Maori,” says Mr Key.</p>
<p>Other features of the reshuffle include the elevation of Maurice Williamson from No 13 to No 9 while retaining his current portfolios.</p>
<p>Wayne Mapp gets the Defence and Auckland Issues portfolios, Chris Finlayson retains Attorney-General and has a change of title to the Treaty Negotiations spokesman. He also gets Arts, Culture and Heritage.</p>
<p>Tim Groser takes the Trade and Associate Finance portfolios, and Anne Tolley becomes Chief Whip with Nathan Guy taking the Junior Whip role.</p>
<p>As well as Mr Guy, other MPs from the large 2005 intake are given more responsibilities. Chester Borrows, a former police officer, takes over as Police spokesman, while Jackie Blue takes the reinstated Women’s Affairs portfolio.</p>
<p>Jonathan Coleman gets the Broadcasting portfolio, Kate Wilkinson becomes Labour &amp; Industrial Relations spokeswoman. Pansy Wong takes the ACC portfolio, and also becomes Ethnic Affairs spokeswoman. Paul Hutchison gets the Tertiary Education portfolio.</p>
<p>“I believe this is a strong line-up that reflects the depth and diversity of talent in our Caucus,” says Mr Key.</p>
<p>“I am sure the team will take the fight to the Labour Government, as well as provide the policies New Zealanders will want to support.”</p>
