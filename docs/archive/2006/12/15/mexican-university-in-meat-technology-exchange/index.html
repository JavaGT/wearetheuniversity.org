<p>Agreement with Mexican University to provide academic exchange in meat technology</p>
<p>Massey University staff will offer workshops in meat technology and beef supply chain management at Mexico’s Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco de Los Estados Unidos Mexanos (UJAT) early next year.</p>
<p>The workshops were agreed to along with reciprocal visits involving academics from both universities in a memorandum of understanding signed yesterday in Palmerston North by the Mexican Ambassador, Her Excellency Madam Angelica Arce, and the University Vice-Chancellor, Professor Judith Kinnear.</p>
<p>Madame Arce says developing academic links between the universities is in the best interests of both parties. Tabasco is one of the main centres for Mexican meat production, much of which is exported to the United States and Canada under free trade agreements.</p>
<p>Fostering relationships with Asia-Pacific countries is a priority for the Mexican Government, she says. “Mexico and New Zealand have had an excellent bilateral relationship, particularly in the field of education.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Kinnear told the Ambassador that Massey distinguished itself not only through its academic outputs but also with its links into industry.</p>
<p>The initial workshop will be conducted from 13-16 February involving 35 participants from all sectors of the Mexican beef industry.</p>
<p>One of the Massey participants, Associate Professor Alex Chu from the College of Sciences, says the main purpose will be to indentify future training needs of UJAT that can be provided by Massey.</p>

<p>“These could involve higher degree training as well as study tours by farmers and technical people from the beef industry in Tabasco.&quot;</p>
<p>The University College of Sciences representative for Latin American links Nicolas Lopez-Villalobos will also participate and act as translator.</p>
<p>The memorandum will be signed at UJAT by the University Rector, Professor M.A.</p>
<p>Candita Victoria Gil Jimenez and witnessed by the New Zealand Ambassador to Mexico, George Troup.</p>
