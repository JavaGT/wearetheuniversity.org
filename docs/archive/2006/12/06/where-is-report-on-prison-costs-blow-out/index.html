<p>Simon Power MP<br>National Party Justice &amp; Corrections Spokesman</p>
<p>6 December 2006</p>
<p>Where is report on prison costs blow-out?</p>
<p>The Government is trying to bury a second report into the prison construction blow-out in the Christmas rush, says National&#39;s Justice &amp; Corrections spokesman, Simon Power.</p>
<p>&quot;Back in September, the Minister of Finance said in answers to parliamentary questions that Treasury&#39;s review into the scope of the prison construction project would be completed &#39;in the next six to eight weeks&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that this second report has yet to be made public, after the damaging findings of the State Services Commission&#39;s report in August, suggests another snow-job.&quot;</p>
<p>The State Services Commission review into the escalating costs of building Spring Hill and Otago prisons found that:</p>
<p>* Without a proper analysis, Corrections adopted an untested contracting method that exposed taxpayers to significant risk because it did not nail down a fixed price from the beginning.<br>* Indicative costs were not known until 20 months after construction began at Spring Hill, and 17 months after work began at Otago.<br>* External contractors had too much influence over major decisions.<br>* Ministers were not kept fully informed about increasing costs.</p>
<p>&quot;In a year that the CEO described as an &#39;annus horribilis&#39; for Corrections, there is no way they will want to go into the holidays with another reminder of just how bad 2006 has been.&quot;</p>
