<p><strong>Wednesday, 6 December 2006, 11:35 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Pansy Wong MP<br>National Party Ethnic Affairs Spokeswoman</p>
<p>6 December 2006</p>
<p>Ethnic communities deserve more than tokenism</p>
<p>National Party Ethnic Affairs spokeswoman Pansy Wong welcomes the latest statistics from the 2006 Census which show that the ethnic population is now at more than 10%.</p>
<p>“Ethnic communities enrich our society. They bring vibrancy, diversity, enterprise and expertise to our culture.</p>
<p>“These figures confirm the trends we’ve seen over the past few years and are a warning to Labour that it needs to engage with our ethnic communities. That means more than visiting festivals and eating the food.</p>
<p>“The changing shape of our communities requires constant maintenance rather than lip service.</p>
<p>“Labour likes to tell everyone they take ‘ethnic perspectives’ into account but that’s a sham. This lofty, idealistic term means nothing because it isn’t translated into the day-to-day workings of the Labour Government.”</p>
<p>Mrs Wong says this week’s report showing high levels of pregnancy, abortion and sexually transmitted diseases among international students should ring alarm bells among policy-makers.</p>
<p>“The code of pastoral care has been a dog’s breakfast. It took far too long, and far too big a drop in international student earnings for Labour to wake up and smell the coffee. These kids deserved better.”</p>
<p>Mrs Wong says New Zealand is crying out for the skills that new migrants can bring, but once in the country they’re largely forgotten by Labour.</p>
<p>“The Labour Government sees all ethnic communities as recent migrants which explains the one-size fits all approach and the confusion surrounding the roles of Migrant Settlement Services and Office of Ethnic Affairs.</p>
<p>“These latest census figures send the message loud and clear to Labour that our ethnic communities should be taken more seriously.”</p>
