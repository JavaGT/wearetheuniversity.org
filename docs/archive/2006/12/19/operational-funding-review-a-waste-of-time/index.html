<p>Schools’ operational funding review a waste of time</p>
<p>National’s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich, believes she won’t be the only one disappointed with reports released today on schools’ operational funding.</p>
<p>“Schools and parents up and down the country will be disappointed with the reports by the Ministry of Education and the Education Review Office.</p>
<p>“They tell us nothing that we didn’t know already: schools are struggling and parents are fundraising like crazy.</p>
<p>“The Labour Government commissioned this review as a way of relieving mounting political pressure from schools and parents to do something about operational funding.</p>
<p>“All the Minister had to do was sit down for 10 minutes with any principal to get a more insightful result. At the cost of many hundreds of thousands of dollars, a year long review was a waste of time.</p>
<p>“Most believed the review would be a catalyst for change, so there will be considerable disappointment that the reports state little more than the obvious, and provide scant insight.</p>
<p>“Releasing the report today is cynically timed so that most principals, teachers and parents, as well as the media, are thinking about Christmas and not the financial pressures of running a school.</p>
<p>“Labour can claim success in one area though – increasing school compliance costs, which the Ministry of Education report confirms is one of the main reasons schools are finding it increasingly more difficult to function.”</p>
