<p>Crown Minerals must sandbag mining firm&#39;s damaging</p>
<p>The Green Party is telling a mining company that it should dump its plans to exploit the seabed for iron sand.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand Investments Ltd has applied to Crown Minerals to prospect for iron sand in the seabed between Taranaki and Waikato River Heads, an area that is home to New Zealand&#39;s endangered Maui&#39;s Dolphin.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders have already made their views on seabed mining very clear, despite the fact that under the present rules Crown Minerals does not have to take any account of the social or environmental impacts of seabed mining applications and is not required to consult the public.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very concerned about the impact of this activity on the handful of remaining Maui&#39;s Dolphins, other marine mammals and the ecosystems beneath the sea that will be devastated by any mining activity.</p>
<p>&quot;I just can&#39;t understand why this Government is allowing mining companies to plunder our seas and ride rough-shod over the wishes of New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;Australia and New Zealand Investments should follow the lead of other companies who have tried and failed, and give up now. New Zealanders don&#39;t want this company exploiting our environment for their gain.</p>
<p>&quot;I am urging New Zealanders to pick up their pens and write to Australia and New Zealand Investments and Crown Minerals to voice their concerns.</p>
