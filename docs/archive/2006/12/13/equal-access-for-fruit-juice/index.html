<p>Equal access for fruit juice</p>
<p>Fruit juice, low kilojoule milk and water need to be as accessible as soft drinks, says Suzi Penny, a nutritional biochemist at the Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health.</p>
<p>She welcomes the move by drink manufacturers to voluntarily withdraw soft drinks and drinks with added sugar from secondary schools.</p>
<p>However she is not in favour of a ban on sugary drinks but says it’s important that healthy alternatives are readily available.</p>
<p>“While it’s great to get sugar-laden fizzy and energy drinks out of schools, children need equal access to healthier choices like fruit juice, milk and water.&quot;</p>
<p>Soft drinks are empty food, with no nutrients, she says.</p>
<p>“Life is a performance, and you cannot perform well on empty foods. Filling up with artificially flavoured and coloured drinks may satisfy the senses, but it is like cheating your body.</p>
<p>“Though fruit juices can be high in kilojoules, they also provide other nutrients. In fact, you are better off having an orange.&quot;</p>
<p>She is not in favour of banning unhealthy choices, but of setting limits on their marketing and promotion.</p>
<p>“It’s not about being a nanny state, that can be counter-productive. It’s about education and promoting healthy choices.&quot;</p>
<p>Flavoured drinks should be seen as ‘treat’ beverages rather than as dietary staple drinks.</p>
