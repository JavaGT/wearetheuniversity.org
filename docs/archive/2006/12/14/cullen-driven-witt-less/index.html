<p><strong>Thursday, 14 December 2006, 4:26 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Dr Paul Hutchison<br>National Party Tertiary Education Spokesman</p>
<p>14 December 2006</p>
<p>Cullen driven &#39;WITT&#39;-less</p>
<p>Labour has been negligent with yet another tertiary institution, this time the Western Institute of Technology at Taranaki (WITT), says National&#39;s Tertiary Education spokesman, Dr Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;Michael Cullen&#39;s negligence over the past six years has cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of valuable education dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;In May this year, Dr Cullen said &#39;I am not aware that WITT is in such a dire state of crisis&#39;, and yet the Government has poured $24 million of grants and loans into the cash-strapped polytech since 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past nine years WITT has posted five deficits - this year it is $5.7 million.</p>
<p>&quot;In March last year, a Crown appointed manager was sent in to assist with the financial management. Four months later the Government handed out a $4.8 million loan.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Dr Cullen has put in a Crown Commissioner and thrown another $7million at them.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has continually demonstrated its inability to financially manage the tertiary sector, with an estimated $1 billion wasted on soft courses, incomplete courses and the Te Wananga o Aotearoa scandal.</p>
<p>&quot;This amounts to a systemic failure throughout the country.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly it&#39;s time for the academics Cullen and Maharey to be led permanently out to pasture. Their failures with provincial tertiary education has literally driven them &#39;WITT-less&#39;.&quot;</p>
