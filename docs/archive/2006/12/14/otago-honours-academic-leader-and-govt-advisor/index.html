<p>Professor Grant was born in Oamaru and educated at Waitaki Boys High School. He graduated as Bachelor of Laws in 1970, Master of Laws with First Class Honours in 1972 and Doctor of Laws (by examination) in 1986 from the University of Otago. He was a lecturer at Southampton University from 1982 to 1986 before becoming Professor of Law and Vice-Dean at University College London.</p>
<p>In 1991 he became Professor of Land Economy at the University of Cambridge and a fellow of Clare College. He was the head of the Department of Land Economy at Canbridge between 1993 and 2001 before accepting the post of Pro-Vice-Chancellor in 2002.</p>

<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg, says the University of Otago is pleased to be able to honour a distinguished graduate.</p>
