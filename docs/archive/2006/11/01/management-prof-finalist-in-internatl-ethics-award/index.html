<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>1 November 2006</p>
<p>Waikato Management School professor a finalist in international ethics awards</p>
<p>A University of Waikato Management School academic has been internationally recognised for her work in strengthening the School’s focus on sustainable business.</p>
<p>Professor Juliet Roper was among the eight finalists for five prestigious international awards for business school researchers. The awards are made annually by the Aspen Institute’s Business and Society Program.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Washington DC, the Aspen Institute is an influential non-profit organisation that fosters enlightened leadership and dialogue across the world.</p>
<p>Every two years, the institute publishes the Beyond Grey Pinstripes survey, which ranks business schools in terms of how well they integrate social and environmental stewardship issues into their teaching and research.</p>
<p>The Aspen Institute’s Faculty Pioneer Awards recognise academics who have demonstrated leadership and risk-taking in integrating social and environmental issues into academic research, educational programmes, and business practice.</p>
<p>The five winners, chosen from 80 nominated academics, included professors from Harvard and Columbia business schools; the other recipients of awards were from business schools in Costa Rica, South Korea and Brussels. The awards will be presented in New York on 10 November.</p>
<p>Prof Roper said she was delighted to have reached the finals. “Being a finalist for an Aspen Institute Faculty Pioneer award is a huge honour. What really pleases me is that it&#39;s recognition of the importance and potential of the Asia Pacific Academy of Business in Society which I have founded with the support of Waikato Management School.&quot;</p>
<p>Founded in 2005, APABIS is an offshoot of EABIS, the European Academy of Business in Society, and aims to bring business and academics to work collaboratively towards understanding and establishing sustainable business in society.</p>
<p>APABIS recently held its second annual forum, where speakers included business commentator Rod Oram, Doug Clover from the Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, and Dr Anna Strutt, Waikato Management School economist and consultant to the Asian Development Bank, the OECD and the World Bank.</p>
<p>Next year, the APABIS forum will be held at the University of the South Pacific in Suva, Fiji.</p>
