<p><strong>Wednesday, 15 November 2006, 5:09 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour ignores 19-year-old fines, reparation</p>
<p>The Government is ignoring hundreds of thousands of unpaid fines, some of which date back 19 years, says National’s Law &amp; Order spokesman, Simon Power.</p>
<p>“Some of these numbers are plainly ridiculous. Some of these fines were imposed while the Berlin Wall was still intact and when Labour had a flat tax policy.”</p>
<p>He is releasing figures which show:</p>
<p>493,760 people owe fines that date back more than a year, including 73,077 that are more than 10 years old, and 7,000 that date back to 1987.</p>
<p>Some for over $100,000 date back to 1992.</p>
<p>More than 18,000 reparations to victims date back more than a year, including 2,300 over 10 years old, and 617 from the 1980s.</p>
<p>At least 16 offenders owe reparations to victims of more than $100,000 dating back to 1997.</p>
<p>284 victims are still owed money from 1987, in one case for $20,000.</p>
<p>“These figures are a disgrace,” says Mr Power.</p>
<p>“This isn’t just about the Government collecting fines, this is also money owed to the victims of crime, some of it dating back to the 1980s.</p>
<p>“How can justice be done when offenders are not paying for their crimes and victims cannot move on?</p>
<p>“Courts Minister Rick Barker claims his Government is ‘doing a very good job collecting fines’, that ‘no one gets off the hook’ and that they have ‘got tougher on people’, but the reality is quite obviously the opposite.</p>
<p>“If his department has neither the inclination nor the ability to chase down these ancient fines and reparations, I wonder if it is not time he seriously considered giving the job to private debt collection agencies.</p>
<p>“Labour have had seven long years to chase these defaulters. The Minister’s claim that no one gets off the hook under him is laughable.”</p>
