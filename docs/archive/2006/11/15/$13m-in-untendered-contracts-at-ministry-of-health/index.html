<p><strong>Wednesday, 15 November 2006, 2:10 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>$13m in untendered contracts at Ministry of Health</p>
<p>More than $13 million has been paid out by the Ministry of Health in the past financial year in untendered contracts, the National Party has revealed.</p>
<p>National’s Associate Health spokesman, Dr Jonathan Coleman, told Parliament’s Health Select Committee today that despite an Auditor-General’s report being severely critical of such practices, the Ministry of Health paid out $13.1 million in untendered contracts during the 2005/06 financial year.</p>
<p>Many of the contracts were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>“This is outrageous and poor financial practice,” says Dr Coleman.</p>
<p>“The Ministry was told by the Auditor-General that it was unacceptable for contracts to be awarded on a sole-provider basis, yet in the 2006 financial year we find $13 million worth of just such contracts.</p>
<p>“Spending public money is a huge responsibility, and tendering processes ensure that the public gets the best possible value for money.</p>
<p>“We already know from the pledge card rort that Pete Hodgson feels entitled to ignore the Auditor-General. Now it’s clear that he’s running his Health Ministry on the same basis,” says Dr Coleman.</p>
