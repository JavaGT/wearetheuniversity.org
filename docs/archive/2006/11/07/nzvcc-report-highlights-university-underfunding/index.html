<p>NZVCC Report Highlights University Underfunding</p>
<p>A report released today by the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors Committee (NZVCC) highlights the fact the New Zealand’s Universities are underfunded and the Government needs to urgently increase levels of funding to public institutions.</p>
<p>“The report shows that New Zealand’s Universities are underfunded when we compare them to Universities overseas,” said Conor Roberts Co-president of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s public investment per full time student is only $5480, whilst Australian Universities receive $6990 and United Kingdom Universities receive $7410.”</p>
<p>“If the Government wants tertiary education to be the driver of social and economic progress, then it needs to properly fund our institutions.”</p>
<p>The report also shows that the 0.9% of GDP which our Government provides to tertiary education institutions is behind the OECD average of 1.1% and countries such as Canada who spend 1.6%.</p>
<p>“We disagree with the Vice-chancellors that the solution to this problem to ‘rebalance’ the ‘investment’ in tertiary institutions.”</p>
<p>“The report notes that there has been a substantial rise in Government support for institutions in the ITP sector, however we believe that fixing the underfunding in Universities should not require cutting funding to the ITP sector.”</p>
<p>“Low levels of public funding is resulting in high and increasing fees, low quality courses, high student to staff ratios and underpaid staff across the whole tertiary sector.”</p>
<p>“We call upon the Government to immediately increase its contribution to public tertiary education in order to fund the high quality tertiary education system that New Zealand needs,” Mr Roberts concluded.</p>
