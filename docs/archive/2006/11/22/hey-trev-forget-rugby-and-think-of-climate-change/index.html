<p>Hey Trev, forget rugby for a second and think of climate change</p>
<p>Green Party Media Release 22nd November 2006</p>
<p>Trevor Mallard should think of climate change instead of rugby for just a second and use his power under the State Owned Enterprises Act to stop Mighty River Power going ahead with the coal-fired Marsden B power station, the Green Party says.</p>
<p>“The Government seems to like talking about climate change and carbon neutrality these days. Here is a case where at the stroke of a pen they can prevent two million tonnes of carbon dioxide being emitted per year, yet the Minister seems more interested in a rugby stadium,” Co-Leader Russel Norman says.</p>
<p>“David Parker, as Minster of Energy, has hinted on radio that Marsden B won’t go ahead, but until the community can be sure, they have no choice but to go ahead with an expensive Environment Court case challenging the firing up of the climate-killing coal power station.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile Trevor Mallard, as Minister of State Owned Enterprises, has the power under Section 13 of the State Owned Enterprises Act to stop Marsden B proceeding by changing the statement of corporate intent of Mighty River Power, a state owned enterprise.</p>
<p>“We now find ourselves in the ridiculous position where a company owned by the taxpayer is proceeding with a court case to start up a coal fired power station while the Prime Minister talks about going carbon neutral and the Minister of Climate Change hints that the station won’t go ahead. Meanwhile, the community wears the cost of fighting it in court.</p>

<p>“Mighty River Power and the community groups will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on this case when the Government could resolve it today. Surely it would be better to spend all that money on renewable energy projects in Whangarei?</p>
<p>“C’mon Trev, I saw you at the Al Gore lecture, now it’s time to put your lessons into practice. Just forget about the stadium long enough to sign the letter to Mighty River Power and Marsden B will not B,” Dr Norman says.</p>
