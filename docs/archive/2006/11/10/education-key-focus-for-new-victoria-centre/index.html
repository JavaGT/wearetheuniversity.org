<p><strong>Friday, 10 November 2006, 4:41 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Education key focus for new Victoria centre</p>
<p>From the effectiveness of professional development for teachers to the impact of the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) on student motivation, a new collaborative research centre at Victoria University of Wellington will investigate educational issues of national and international significance.</p>
<p>The Jessie Hetherington Centre for Educational Research will be launched on Wednesday 15 November at 5pm by the Hon Dr Michael Cullen, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tertiary Education. This will take place at the University’s Karori Campus, home of the College of Education that includes educational specialists across a wide range of education studies and teacher education areas of expertise.</p>
<p>Victoria University Vice Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh, said academics in the Centre would be undertaking research into critical areas of public importance.</p>
<p>“Education, from early childhood through to primary and secondary, plays a vital role in providing young New Zealanders with the skills they need to succeed when they enter the workforce or tertiary education and to participate in society.</p>
<p>“The education system, however, faces not only the challenges of our ever-changing modern world, but also increasingly higher expectations from parents, students and society. Therefore the work that staff in the Centre undertake will ensure that decisions teachers, policy makers and the public make about the future of our education system are informed by the latest research.”</p>

<p>Professor Walsh said the Centre, led by Professor Luanna Meyer, would build on the previous successes of the College of Education and the University.</p>
<p>“The Jessie Hetherington Centre for Educational Research is well placed for recognition as a leader in educational research, given the expertise and experience of its staff, the quality of past research initiatives, and our location in the nation’s capital. Since the merger between the Wellington College of Education and Victoria University at the beginning of 2005, we’ve seen a significant increase in external research income generated by the academics based at Karori.</p>
<p>“Victoria University’s location in Wellington – in close proximity to government agencies such as the Ministry of Education and professional bodies such as the New Zealand Teachers Council – provides unique opportunities for research and development linkages,” Professor Walsh said. The Jessie Hetherington Centre for Educational Research is the tenth research centre to be launched at Victoria University since 2002. It is named after a distinguished pioneer in education, Jessie Hetherington who lived from 1882 to 1971 and pushed the boundaries of equity and excellence through her work and commitments.</p>
