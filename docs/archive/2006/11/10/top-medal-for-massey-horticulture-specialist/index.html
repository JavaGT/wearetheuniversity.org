<p>Top medal for Massey horticulture specialist</p>
<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Palmerston North) Professor Ian Warrington has received the Institute of Agriculture and Horticultural Science’s top award, the Jubilee Medal.</p>
<p>The medal, for significant achievement and outstanding contributions to horticultural science, will be presented at the Royal Society’s Science Dinner at Auckland’s Hilton Hotel next Wednesday (15 November).</p>
<p>Professor Warrington is a Massey graduate, receiving a first-class masters degree in horticultural science in 1972 and a Doctor of Science degree in 1989. His research career began at the former Department for Scientific and Industrial Research, focusing on plant response to environmental factors such as temperature, light intensity, day length and carbon dioxide concentration.</p>
<p>In the next 30 years he became known internationally for his work in environmental physiology and on improving the training and management methods for apples and kiwfruit. He has published more than 120 refereed papers and co-edited books on kiwifruit and apples, detailing research and production information on them from throughout the world.</p>
<p>In 1994 Professor Warrington became the first New Zealander to be made a Fellow of the American Society for Horticultural Science; in 2001 he was awarded an honorary degree in literature from Massey. He is current Vice-President of the International Society for Horticultural Science.</p>
