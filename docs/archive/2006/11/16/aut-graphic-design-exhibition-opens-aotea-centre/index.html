<p><strong>AUT Graphic Design exhibition opens at Aotea Centre</strong></p>
<p>Parodying faulty perceptions of South Auckland is the basis for AUT Bachelor of Design student Corinne Smith&#39;s end of year exhibition. Smith is one of 100 Bachelor of Design and Honours students showcasing their work at the Aotea Centre in this year&#39;s AUT Graphic Design graduate exhibition.</p>

<p>Now in its sixteenth year at the Aotea Centre, the design exhibition covers all areas of communications graphics, illustration, photography, multimedia and design.</p>
<p>Smith, who grew up in Manurewa and lived there until a couple of months ago, says she wanted to use design to challenge negative perceptions of South Auckland around the gang culture, violence, environment, drugs and crime.</p>
<p>&quot;South Auckland is not what it is made out to be. It&#39;s safe to go out at night. There are good people doing good things,&quot; says the third-year Bachelor of Design student.</p>
<p>The exhibition, titled Southside, parodies the perceptions in a &quot;Standards Manual of Southside&quot;. Traditionally, companies use standards manuals to set out international corporate design and branding regulations, and manage the organisation&#39;s public image.</p>

<p>Smith&#39;s manual sets out standards recommendations like the &quot;minimum gap between hoodie and pants to reveal undergarments&quot; and campaign slogans including: &quot;It&#39;s a great house. It&#39;s a state house. Southside.&quot;</p>
<p>International standards manuals are often written in several languages, and in keeping with that Smith&#39;s manual is written in English, Maori and Samoan.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt like this was a more powerful way to respond to the moral outcry in the media and amongst the wider public. Instead of going against this strong construction, I felt like you could make people question it by undermining it through the parody.&quot;</p>
