<p>Media Release</p>

<p>Donnelly Welcomes Universities of Technology Bill</p>
<p>New Zealand First&#39;s education spokesperson Brian Donnelly has welcomed the introduction of his Education (Establishment of Universities of Technology) Amendment Bill to Parliament today.</p>
<p>The Bill amends the Education Act 1989 and seeks to establish a new category of tertiary institution, a university of technology.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking at the feasibility and benefit of establishing a non-university class of institution for technology is part of New Zealand First&#39;s Confidence and Supply agreement with the Government,&quot; said Mr Donnelly.</p>
<p>&quot;The primary aim of establishing a university of technology category is to establish closer links with business and industry and engagement in applied research at a tertiary level.</p>
<p>&quot;Universities of technology will raise workplace skills and knowledge to meet a broad range of industry, business and community needs, and place us on a level playing field with overseas education providers.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bill will allow for students to move seamlessly across various levels of tertiary education, with delivery of appropriate sub-degree programmes and pathways which allow them to progress to higher levels of education and training as and when required to pursue their career goals.</p>
<p>&quot;Opening up opportunities for students to engage in research and practice in a stimulating environment that presents a variety of career opportunities will help to ensure we keep our best students and provide for research and development expertise,&quot; concluded Mr Donnelly.</p>
