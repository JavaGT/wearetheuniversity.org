<p>Strike shuts down elective surgery</p>
<p>The planned laboratory workers’ strike will shut down all elective surgery in public hospitals throughout New Zealand for a week, says National’s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>The planned strike, starting next Wednesday, will affect laboratory services and blood services. Hospitals are now in high-level contingency planning.</p>
<p>The strike will also affect most elective surgery in private hospitals, as well as outpatient clinics throughout the country.</p>
<p>&quot;More than 2,000 patients will have their operations cancelled because of this strike,”says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>“Unlucky patients will be notified over the next few days.</p>
<p>&quot;This strike will be much worse than the junior doctors’ strike, where senior doctors were able to step into the breach.</p>
<p>&quot;The Health Minister&#39;s divisive approach to industrial relations is costing thousands of patients elective surgery. We&#39;ve never seen so much industrial action in hospitals as we have this year.</p>
<p>&quot;It is time Health Minister Pete Hodgson moved to knock heads together to prevent even more people missing out on elective surgery,” says Mr Ryall.</p>
