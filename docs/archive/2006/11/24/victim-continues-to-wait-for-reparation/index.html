<p>Simon Power<br>National Party Law &amp; Order Spokesman</p>

<p>Victim continues to wait for reparation</p>
<p>National&#39;s Law &amp; Order spokesman, Simon Power, says it is not acceptable that any victims of crime have to wait years for reparation, let alone those who are sick and vulnerable.</p>
<p>He is commenting on a report that an ill elderly woman is still waiting to receive the bulk of the $2,000 in reparations she was awarded after she was attacked at her home nearly two years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel extremely sorry for this woman. She has received only $600 in reparation when she would have received it all by now had the order been pursued by the authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;Having to wait that long under normal circumstances is not acceptable, but in her case it&#39;s appalling.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is letting victims down by allowing offenders get away for years without paying.</p>
<p>&quot;Last week I released figures that show:<br>* 18,000 victims are owed reparations dating back more than a year, 2,300 reparations are more than 10 years old, and 617 date from the 1980s. * Of the top 10 defaulters, seven owe a total of $1.2 million, with the highest $275,000 for one outstanding order, and another owing $137,188 for three orders.<br>* At least 16 offenders owe reparations of more than $100,000 dating back to 1997. * 284 victims are still owed money from 1987, in one case for $20,000.</p>
<p>&quot;These figures are a disgrace.</p>
<p>&quot;Receiving reparation gives closure to the victims of crime, and at the moment there are thousands of victims, like this woman, who haven&#39;t got that closure because the Government is failing to ensure payments are made.</p>
<p>&quot;How are victims supposed to move on with their lives if reparations ordered by the court haven&#39;t been paid? And how can justice be done when offenders are not paying up?</p>
<p>&quot;This Government has had seven years to do something about improving the system, but they&#39;ve done nothing. They must come up with a fast and effective means of getting reparation off offenders.&quot;</p>
