<p>National&#39;s Get-The-Sack-In-90-Days Bill Rejected</p>
<p>&quot;National should think twice next time they decide that having a grab at New Zealanders&#39; right to a fair go at work is a smart idea,&quot; CTU president Ross Wilson said today.</p>
<p>National&#39;s Employment Relations (Probationary Employment) Amendment Bill was thrown out at its Second Reading in Parliament a short time ago, with Labour, New Zealand First, the Greens, the Maori Party and the Progressive Party voting against it.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s bill was an affront to fair minded New Zealanders, who don&#39;t think basic rights at work such as a fair hearing should be up for grabs. Unions will continue to defend the rights of ordinary working New Zealanders against National&#39;s anti worker agenda,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased in particular with the Maori Party&#39;s decision to reject this bill,&quot; CTU Maori Vice president Sharon Clair said.</p>
<p>&quot;The CTU Runanga worked with the Maori Party since the Bill was introduced, to outline our view that the Bill was not good for Maori workers, and that there are much better ways of addressing high Maori unemployment that don&#39;t deny workers their rights,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;The debate on the Bill provoked a significant response from workers throughout the country, evidenced by the big turnouts at EPMU led rallies in Auckland and Wellington, and the actions of thousands of other union members and workers. They will be pleased that Parliament has today rejected National&#39;s attack on their rights,&quot; Ross Wilson said.</p>
