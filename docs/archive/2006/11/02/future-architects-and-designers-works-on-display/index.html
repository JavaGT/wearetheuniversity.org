<p>2 November 2006</p>
<p>Future architects’ and designers’ works on display</p>
<p>The work of New Zealand’s future architects and designers will be featured in a two week exhibition at Victoria University’s Te Aro Campus from 4 to 17 November 2006.</p>
<p>The University’s Schools of Architecture and Design will showcase the work of final year Architecture, Building Science and Design students as well as displaying some of the best projects from the Industrial, Digital, Landscape and Interior Design programmes.</p>
<p>On display will be four projects selected for competition in the national Dulux New Zealand Institute of Architects Student Awards for 2006. The designers of these schemes will compete against the best work from New Zealand’s other architecture schools later this month.</p>
<p>Highlights include:<br> Ken Howe’s Industrial Design project has taken gyroscopic transport devices to a new level of convenience, portability and fun and designed a compact electric unicycle small enough to be carried like a briefcase or backpack.<br> Sean Leogreen’s Landscape Architecture project is an exploration and response to the tensions connecting wetlands, human activity, carpark and ferry terminal at Maitaitai Bay, Waiheke Island.<br> Richard Burns’ design of a new Broadcasting House based on a contemporary critique of the original broadcasting house that served as an icon for journalism and the musical creative arts from 1963 to 1997.<br> Claire Sharpe’s investigation into how architecture can contribute to the activation of festival events in Wellington.<br> Scott McKenzie’s eloquent model of sustainable development, a local and regional Government Environmental Education Centre that regenerates a degraded urban environment.<br> Yifan Zang’s engagement with ideas of cultural reservation and heritage protection through the urban redevelopment of a large Chinese military facility.<br> Kimberley Stephenson’s interior design for the lobby of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa which challenges the mirror line between shadow and reflection.<br> Natasha Cox’s interior design of Circa Theatre where light determines visual boundaries.<br> Johanna De Jong’s interior design of Archives New Zealand that accesses the past through spaces integrated to reflect systems of memory.<br> Krystle Stewart’s Building Science (Hons) research project examines daylight availability in apartments. Her research indicates that many apartments struggle to meet daylight requirements. Krystle has devised a tool to address this issue.</p>
