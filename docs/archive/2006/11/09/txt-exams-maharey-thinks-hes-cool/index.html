<p>TXT exams: Maharey thinks he’s cool</p>
<p>Labour’s acceptance of text language in NCEA exams undermines standards and is misleading to students, says National’s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>He is commenting on confirmation from the NZQA today that it will accept exam answers written in text message-style language in NCEA exams.</p>
<p>“Education Minister Steve Maharey should put his foot down and just say ‘no’ to this ridiculous idea,”says Mr English.</p>
<p>“The Minister and the NZQA are more interested in trying to look cool than in ensuring high standards in the classroom.</p>
<p>“Most students are smart enough to know that they need to use standard English to communicate their ideas, but this decision gives them licence to slack off. Students I have spoken to just can’t believe their luck.</p>
<p>“This kind of pigeon English is fine for young people organising their social lives, but it is not an acceptable way of expressing an academic argument or idea.</p>
<p>“Students should communicate in exams the way they would in the workplace, and even Steve Maharey must know that no employer will accept any kind of report written in text-speak.</p>
<p>“At a time when the Government should be doing all it can to build confidence in NCEA, this barmy decision will only further undermine confidence in the troubled qualification,” says Mr English.</p>
