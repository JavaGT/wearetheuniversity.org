<p>VUWSA backs ‘keep it 18’ campaign</p>
<p>VUWSA supports the campaign to keep the drinking age at 18. VUWSA is the representative organisation for the 20,000 students at Victoria University, many of whom are between the ages of 18-20.</p>
<p>“VUWSA has long standing policy supporting 18 years of age being the legal age to purchase alcohol” says Nick Kelly VUWSA president. “The bill to raise the drinking age to 20 currently before parliament is nothing more than a knee jerk reaction by conservative politicians who are completely out of touch with reality”.</p>
<p>“On the one hand some members of parliament are considering lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 12, yet these same politicians don’t want young people to buy a 6 pack of beer till they are 20” says Nick. “It shows a total contempt for young people if politicians try to force on teenagers all the responsibilities of adulthood yet try to deny them of rights such as purchasing alcohol”.</p>
<p>“This bill deserves to be thrown out of parliament, along with the ratbag politicians who are pushing this crap!”</p>
