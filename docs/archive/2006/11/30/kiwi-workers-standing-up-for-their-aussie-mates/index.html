<p>Kiwi Workers Standing Up For Their Aussie Mates Today</p>
<p>&quot;In solidarity with Australian workers, New Zealand unionists are today staging a publicity blitz in city centres to highlight the attack on workers rights happening across workplaces throughout Australia,&quot; NZCTU president Ross Wilson said.</p>
<p>Australia&#39;s WorkChoices legislation, introduced earlier this year, removes unfair dismissal protection for millions of Australian workers, and strips back many other terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Australian unions are right now in the middle of their third national day of community protest in 300 cities and towns across Australian. Hundreds of thousands are expected to attend rallies and community meetings, including up to 80,000 expected at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.</p>
<p>&quot;The CTU has written to Prime Minister John Howard to outline our concerns with the laws, which are contrary to international labour standards. A number of our affiliated unions with connection to Australian companies will be writing to these companies to express their concern and opposition to the Work Choices legislation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Unions in New Zealand beat off an attempt by the National Party to remove rights at work for the first ninety days on the job, but as we inform New Zealand workers about what&#39;s happening in Australian workplaces - the message is not to take their rights for granted,&quot; Ross Wilson said.</p>
