<p>Report confirms families are not better off under Labour</p>
<p>The Labour-led Government has squandered a golden opportunity to make families better off, says National’s Families spokeswoman, Judith Collins.</p>
<p>She is responding to reports of a research project led by Prime Minister Helen Clark&#39;s husband, Peter Davis, an Auckland University sociologist, which found that:</p>
<p>• The median family income, after adjusting for inflation and family size, was just over $37,000 in 2001 – the same as it was in 1981.<br>• In the same period, the proportion of working women rose from 47% to 61%.</p>
<p>“Put simply, families are not better off under Labour,” says Ms Collins.</p>
<p>“Families on middle and low incomes have ended up just holding their own.</p>
<p>“Even though more women are in the workforce, two or more incomes don&#39;t seem to be making it financially easier for families.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear from this report that things haven’t got better under Labour.</p>
<p>“Sure, there are more people in employment – but it&#39;s low-paid employment.</p>
<p>“Twenty years on, family incomes have stayed the same, and that is despite the excellent export prices and the booming economy since 2000.</p>
<p>“So much for Labour&#39;s so-called ‘family friendly’ policies.</p>
<p>“More people are working, but they are working for the same money and that is doing nothing to close the income gap between New Zealand and Australia.”</p>
