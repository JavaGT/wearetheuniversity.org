<p>Ageing in New Zealand</p>
<p>The ageing workforce, elder care and the living standards of older people are some of the issues to be discussed at a major conference next week, jointly sponsored by Victoria University’s New Zealand Institute for Research on Ageing.</p>
<p>The conference, held on Monday 13 November at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa also marks the 25th anniversary of the New Zealand Association of Gerontology.</p>
<p>Institute Director, Associate Professor Judith Davey, says the conference marks a significant milestone in promoting understanding of research on ageing and its policy implications.</p>
<p>“It will be an opportunity for participants to explore ideas, hear the latest research advances, and to meet others and share experiences.”</p>
<p>Sixteen papers will be presented from a wide range of topics and perspectives related to ageing, including discussions on older workers, elder care and the physical and material wellbeing of older people. There will also be a panel session considering how research and policy can work together to address the challenges of population ageing.</p>
<p>Professor Hal Kendig, of the University of Sydney, will be the keynote speaker.</p>
<p>The Minister for Social Development and Employment, Hon David Benson-Pope, will address the conference at 3.30pm.</p>
<p>The conference will be attended by researchers, policy analysts and advisors, those working in the health sector, and members of the public.</p>
