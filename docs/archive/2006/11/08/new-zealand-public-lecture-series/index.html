<p>New Zealand Public Lecture Series</p>
<p>Claire Doherty author of Contemporary Art: From Studio to Situation presents the public lecture From studio to Situation: How Contemporary Art Grew Out of Place. This will be an opportunity for both the public and arts specialists audiences to familiarise themselves with Doherty’s interests and the ideas that will form the basis of her fellowship and eventual project in Wellington in early 2008. Her lecture promises to be provocative and enlightening, especially in relation to the growing materialisation of big single events/exhibitions in both New Zealand and the international visual arts scene.</p>
<p>Doherty will discuss how the international visual arts landscape has become dominated by the artwork as situation. Emerging at biennials, art fairs, through the programmes of kunsthalle, museums and commissioning agencies, through digitial media, radio and tv broadcasts, these works are recognisable by their project rather than object-based nature. Often time-based, performative or participatory, place-based or place-responsive, they demand new curatorial approaches, display techniques, promotional and financial systems and perhaps most importantly different kinds of engagement from their audiences and participants. Doherty will examine the challenges of such works for audiences, curators and artists. Her lecture will introduce and compare some of the most significant international projects of the past five years, exploring and interrogating how the site-specific became place-responsive. She will ask for whom such projects are produced, whether there should be a code of ethics for such projects and does it matter what is left behind?</p>
