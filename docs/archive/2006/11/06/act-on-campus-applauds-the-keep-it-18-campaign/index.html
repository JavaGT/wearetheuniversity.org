<p>ACT On Campus Applauds The Keep it 18 Campaign</p>
<p>Youth wings of parties from across the political spectrum today showed solidarity in their opposition to the Sale of Liquor (Youth Harm Reduction) Amendment Bill. ACT On Campus joined with representatives from the Young Nationals, Young Labour and Young Greens in condemning the Bill.</p>
<p>ACT On Campus opposes the Bill on the grounds of individual responsibility. While a minority of young people are irresponsible with the way they drink, this is no reason to disadvantage the responsible majority who harmlessly enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>ACT On Campus believes the proposed changes will do little to curb youth drinking problems. There is a danger that young people will respond to the changes by drinking in unsupervised surroundings rather than the supervised safety of bars and cafes.</p>
<p>ACT On Campus has circulated a drinking age banner to University Campuses around the country. The banner has been signed by hundreds of students and young people who oppose efforts to raise the drinking age.</p>
<p>The Bill is less about solving problems than it is about appearing to do something. ACT On Campus believes in working with communities and the individuals who are most at risk, rather than penalising an entire section of society.</p>
