<p>Another Great Success for Maori Health Providers<br>Monday 6 November 2006<br>Tariana Turia; Co-leader, Maori Party</p>
<p>Tariana Turia, Co-leader of the Maori Party, today congratulated Ngati Porou Hauora and Otago University (Te Puia) as the supreme winner of the 2006 Whanau Ora Awards winner of Te Tohu Kahukura; as well as the Whanau Whanui category.</p>
<p>“The Whanau Ora awards are a fantastic reflection of the innovation that is occurring in the Maori health sector” said Mrs Turia, health spokesperson for the Maori Party.</p>
<p>“I am sure that the late Tame Te Maro would be extremely pleased with Ngati Porou Hauora’s success. His faith in the people, in rangatiratanga, the belief in the importance of a healthy lifestyle, is reflected in the special role Ngati Porou Hauora plays within their community”.</p>
<p>“Their programme, Ngati and Healthy, is a great ways of tackling the risk of type two diabetes by getting the whole community on board. I’m really impressed at the way they combine local knowledge with the expertise about nutrition and measurement of outcomes from the Edgar National Centre for Diabetes Research (Otago University)”.</p>
<p>“I am particularly pleased that the other two major awards were presented to health providers in the Te Tai Hauauru electorate” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“I am so proud for all our Ngati Apa/Nga Wairiki and Ngati Hauiti whanau who have been honoured for the work they are doing to enhance whanau health and well-being” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>Te Kotuku Hauora o Rangitikei operates within the iwi boundaries of Ngati Apa and Ngati Hauiti, thus including Ratana and Marton. They won the Whanau Whaiti category of the awards for their fitness and mobility initiative for kaumatua, ‘Health in Action’.</p>

<p>“Their key focus is on working hard with whanau, building on their strengths, by being prepared to try anything –including tai chi, te ao matua kore, and push play” said Mrs Turia. “I hear they over-whelmed the crowds with their kaumatua line-dancing display. I can well believe it!”</p>
<p>“The team at Te Kotuku believe that our whanau are entitled to enjoy wellness and wellbeing” said Mrs Turia. “Their success in this national awards is a great tribute to their leadership amongst our communities”.<br>Mrs Turia congratulated Hora Te Pai Health Services (Waikanae) for their success in winning the Whanau Rahi Award. Hora Te Pai represents the interests of descendants of Ati Awa and kindred tribes (Ngäti Tama, Ngäti Mutunga, Ngäti Maru).<br>“I was delighted to be present with them, when they were recently awarded Accreditation status by Quality Health New Zealand” said Mrs Turia. “Hora Te Pai is the only kaupapa Maori service proving primary health services (GP services) for Maori living between Paekakariki and Pekapeka”.</p>
<p>Mrs Turia also congratulated all the finalists for 2006, who were all recognised for their achievement in the business of Maori health.</p>
<p>“What we see with the Whanau Ora awards is the leadership our Maori Health providers are bringing to this sector” said Mrs Turia. “The originality, the excellence and the passion of Maori health providers is inspirational”.</p>
<p>“But their biggest success is the fact that through their initiatives, whanau are being supported to achieve well being in all areas of their life. Our congratulations to you all”.</p>
<p>The winners of the 2006 Whänau Ora Awards were announced in Wellington on Friday 3 November, at a gala dinner to celebrate the achievements of the providers of Mäori health and disability services throughout Aotearoa.</p>
