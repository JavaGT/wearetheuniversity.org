<p>Media Release</p>
<p>6 November 2006<br>Attention: Political and Education reporters<br>For Immediate Release</p>
<p>Female students demand flexible working hours</p>
<p>Now is the time for flexible working hours legislation, say the Tertiary Women’s Focus Group (TWFG), the women’s policy and campaign group of the New Zealand Union of Students Associations (NZUSA).</p>
<p>The TWFG have recently joined the coalition for Flexible Working Hours, which has the goal of legislating the right to request flexible hours for all workers.</p>
<p>“Student debt is still growing, and access to quality flexible working hours would benefit students greatly”, says Jennifer Jones, National Women’s Rights Officer for NZUSA and facilitator of the TWFG. “Not only would flexible hours make it easier for students to find work, but it would be an incentive for students to do so.”</p>
<p>“The current user-pays system discourages women from training in particular areas or from re-entering study because of high fees and lack of access to allowances or part-time scholarships,” Jones said.</p>
<p>“Flexible hours would allow these women to work and study, and keep their student debt to a minimum.”</p>
<p>“In addition”, said Jones, “many students, particularly women, juggle study with family responsibilities. If flexible hours were available, fitting work around these other activities would not be so problematic.”</p>
<p>The Flexible Working Hours coalition is being launched today at 12pm in the Beehive West Foyer, Wellington.</p>
