<p>29 November 2006</p>
<p>Mr Gormsby Comes to Victoria</p>
<p>Acclaimed New Zealand playwright Dave Armstrong will be the 2007 Writer in Residence at Victoria University</p>
<p>Mr Armstrong is well used to accolades. He has twice won the Best New New Zealand Play at the Chapman Tripp Theatre Awards, as well as the award for Best Comedy Script at the 2003 AFTA Television Awards.</p>
<p>He co-wrote the prize-winning play Niu Sila with Oscar Kightley. It has already become a New Zealand classic and will be performed at the 2007 Pasifika Styles Festival in Cambridge, England.</p>
<p>His most recent stage play King and Country, about New Zealand soldiers in World War I, has played to sold-out houses around New Zealand. As well as actors, it features a live brass band conducted by the author, who holds a Bachelor of Music degree from Victoria.</p>
<p>Mr Armstrong is also a prolific writer for television. He co-created and co-wrote two series of Seven Periods with Mr Gormsby. His other scripting and editing credits include Skitz, The Semisis, Shortland Street, Spin Doctors, and Bro’town.</p>
<p>During 2007, Mr Armstrong will work at the International Institute of Modern Letters at Victoria. He plans to write two stage plays during his residency.</p>
<p>&#39;I&#39;m absolutely delighted to be returning to Victoria University. I spent five happy years there as a student of music and drama, and I look forward to working in such a stimulating and creative environment.&#39;</p>
<p>Institute Director, Professor Bill Manhire, says Mr Armstrong’s appointment is a very exciting prospect.</p>
<p>“We have a very strong scriptwriting programme, and it’s going to be enormously valuable for our students to have a writer of Dave’s gifts and practical experience right here on campus.”</p>
<p>The Writer in Residence position is jointly funded by Victoria University and Creative New Zealand.</p>
