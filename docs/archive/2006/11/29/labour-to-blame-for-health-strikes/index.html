<p>Labour to blame for health strikes</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s industrial relations law is to blame for the strike by laboratory workers which started today and which could threaten the safety of thousands of patients, say National&#39;s Industrial Relations spokesman Wayne Mapp and Health spokesman Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s law is directly responsible for this strike and the increasing number of strikes in the past year,&quot; says Dr Mapp.</p>
<p>&quot;In the year to June, we had the highest number of strikes since 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;The complete failure of good-faith bargaining is at the heart of Labour&#39;s policies, and that is what has happened with the laboratory workers.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has made it illegal for employers to directly communicate with employees, and this is hugely disruptive to proper workplace relationships.</p>
<p>&quot;Their preference for multi-employer collective contracts is behind most of these problems, including the threatened strike next month by the Service &amp; Food Workers Union, whose members include hospital cleaners, kitchen and food workers, orderlies and home-aides.</p>
<p>&quot;In government, National will remove these divisive union preferences and the &#39;us v them&#39; mentality that Labour has brought to employment law,&quot; Dr Mapp says.</p>
<p>Tony Ryall says the industrial relations scene in the health sector in general is getting worse by the day, with staff no longer trusting the DHB negotiators.</p>
<p>&quot;This is becoming a nightmare, and it is time the Health Minister organised a credible &#39;honest broker&#39; to sort this mess out.</p>
<p>&quot;The disruption caused by this strike, which is due to last for seven days, will be devastating.</p>
<p>&quot;My fear is that it is not going to be the last, so we can expect even more patient disruption.</p>
<p>&quot;It is time the Health Minister did something other than sitting by and watching it happen,&quot; Mr Ryall says.</p>
