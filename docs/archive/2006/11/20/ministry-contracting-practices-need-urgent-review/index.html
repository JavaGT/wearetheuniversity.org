<p>Dr Jackie Blue MP<br>National Party Associate Health Spokeswoman</p>
<p>19 November 2006</p>
<p>Ministry contracting practices need urgent review</p>
<p>It has become abundantly clear that the Government&#39;s contracting practices need urgent reviewing, says National Party Associate Health spokeswoman Dr Jackie Blue.</p>
<p>She is commenting on a media report today that a company run by a Tongan businessman with Labour Party connections got hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars in Winz contracts - despite two of his companies being liquidated with unpaid taxes of more than $100,000.</p>
<p>&quot;For some time, National has had serious concerns with the Ministry of Health&#39;s contracting practices,&quot; says Dr Blue.</p>
<p>&quot;One example of this is the contract the ministry has with the Women&#39;s Health Action Trust, run by former Labour Party Women&#39;s vice president Jo Fitzpatrick.</p>
<p>&quot;In June last year the trust was awarded an un-tendered contract worth more than $300,000 for &#39;women&#39;s health and breastfeeding advocacy and promotion&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;The contract, which ends in June 2008, is well outside the ministry&#39;s own contracting guidelines, which states that a fully competitive process should be followed for contracts above $25,000.</p>
<p>&quot;Another case in point is the ministry&#39;s three-year $1.8 million national depression initiative with advertising agency FCB. Answers to questions at last week&#39;s health select committee reveal $800,000 of that contract was un-tendered.</p>
<p>&quot;My colleague, National MP Jonathan Coleman, told that select committee that despite an Auditor-General&#39;s report being critical of un-tendered contracts, the ministry paid out $13.1 million in un-tendered contracts in the 2005-06 financial year.</p>
<p>&quot;The time has come for Pete Hodgson and the ministry accept it has a huge responsibility when using taxpayers&#39; money, and all care must be taken to ensure the public gets the best value for money.</p>
<p>&quot;If contracts worth several hundred thousand dollars aren&#39;t tendered, taxpayers are not certain of getting best value for money.&quot;</p>
