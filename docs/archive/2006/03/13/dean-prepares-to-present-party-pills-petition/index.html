<p>Dean Prepares to Present Party Pills Petition</p>
<p>National&#39;s MP for Otago Jacqui Dean will present a petition seeking extensive research into the effects of party pills to parliament on Wednesday (March 15).</p>
<p>Almost 7000 people have signed the petition which was launched by Mrs Dean late last year in Oamaru.</p>
<p>Since then the petition has been circulated throughout the country, sparking a public awareness campaign and wide spread public discussion in the use and sale of party pills.</p>
<p>“My initial concerns that we simply don’t know enough about these drugs have been borne out by the response received to the petition and the feedback from young and old people.</p>
<p>“I’ve also received strong support from within the National Party who are keen to see action on this issue sooner rather than later. People signing the petition can rest assured that I will follow this through to the highest levels to see their concerns addressed.”</p>
<p>Since launching the petition, Mrs Dean has spoken at a public meeting in Balclutha, met with various alcohol and drug industry representatives and discussed the matter with members of the public.</p>
<p>She has also made complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority over posters used to sell party pills and, written to the Health Minster seeking funding into research.</p>
<p>“As I’ve said from the beginning my concerns grew from both a personal level as a parent and at a legislative level.</p>
<p>“The marketing and availability of party pills lowers the threshold for what is acceptable for young people to be taking. It is their potential harm that concerns me as well as the ease with which they can be accessed and the methods used in their marketing,” she says.</p>
