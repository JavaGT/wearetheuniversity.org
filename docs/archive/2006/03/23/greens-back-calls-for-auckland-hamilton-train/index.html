<p>Greens back calls for Auckland - Hamilton train service</p>
<p>Green MPs Keith Locke and Nandor Tanczos - based in Auckland and Hamilton respectively - have backed calls for a commuter rail link between the two cities.</p>
<p>The Hamilton City Council and Waikato Regional Council announced today that they will fund a feasibility study into such a service.</p>
<p>&quot;We are always keen to see investment in and improvement to public transport networks, and a commuter service between Auckland and Hamilton would seem to make a lot of sense,&quot; says Green Party Associate Transport (Auckland) Spokesperson Keith Locke.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything we can do to reduce congestion, conserve fuel and ultimately reduce our reliance on fossil fuels is a good thing, so I hope Land Transport New Zealand will give this option serious consideration when it eventually comes before them.</p>
<p>&quot;I travelled on the final &#39;Hamilton Connection&#39; train journey on 5 October, 2002, and gave flowers to the staff in appreciation of their contribution over the years. I expressed the view then that the service shouldn&#39;t be ended, and committed the Greens to working for its resumption,&quot; Mr Locke says.</p>
<p>Hamilton-based MP Nandor Tanczos has lent his weight to the call, from a practical as well as a political perspective.</p>
<p>&quot;More and more Aucklanders are moving into the Waikato because of housing prices, so commuting is becoming a bigger issue. It makes absolute sense to invest in a commuter line.</p>
<p>&quot;I personally would definitely make use of this service. Every time I go to Auckland I have to drive for two or more hours each way. Being able to stretch out on a train, get out my laptop and papers and do a bit of work would be just great.</p>
<p>&quot;From a social, economic, and ecological point of view I have to say top marks to Hamilton City and to the Waikato Regional Council for raising this issue,&quot; Mr Tanczos says.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
