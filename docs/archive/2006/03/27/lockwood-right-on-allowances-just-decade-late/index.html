<p>Lockwood right on allowances – just decade late</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) found itself in complete agreement with National’s Lockwood Smith with regard to access to student allowances.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Sunday Star Times, Dr Smith, the former Minister of Education from 1990-96 admitted that the requirement for students to be tested on their parents’ income until the age of 25 was unfair and regrettable.</p>
<p>“Its great that Dr Smith now understands the absurdity of means testing students on their parents income until they turn 25, its just a shame he didn’t do anything about it while he was in charge,” said Conor Roberts, Co-President of NZUSA.</p>
<p>“We call upon Dr. Smith to immediately introduce a Private Members Bill into the House in order to rectify this unfair policy.”</p>
<p>“Students are the only group in society to whom this discriminatory age test applies; no one else is treated like a child and dependent on their parents until they turn 25.”</p>
<p>“We hope that Dr Smith is able to convince the rest of the National caucus that dropping the unfair age test is a good idea.”</p>
<p>“Currently only one third of students have access to a living allowance while they study and the number of recipients is dropping. We believe that the government must provide universal access to student living allowances by getting rid of the discriminatory age test, and it is great that National’s former Minister of Education agrees,” Mr Roberts concluded.</p>
