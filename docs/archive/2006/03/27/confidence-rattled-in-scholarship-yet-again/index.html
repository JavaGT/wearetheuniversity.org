<p>Bill English MP<br>National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>26 March 2006</p>
<p>Confidence rattled in scholarship - yet again</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English says the latest complaints about this year’s scholarship exams show Labour’s complacency is ill founded.</p>
<p>“No doubt there’s been an improvement on last year, but these latest results show that the Government’s complacency isn’t justified. Some of our brightest achievers still aren’t getting a fair deal.”</p>
<p>Mr English is referring to the two most recent cases revealed in the past two weeks.</p>
<p>Today it has been revealed that eight students who achieved full marks visual arts weren’t given outstanding scholarships when, in every other subject, those who achieved full marks did.</p>
<p>“Students can’t be asked to do any better,” notes Mr English.</p>
<p>And last week it was revealed that the calculus exam was so badly set that half the students got less than 5% and students who got as little as 18% gained scholarships.</p>
<p>Mr English says these problems are in addition to NZQA’s earlier admissions about the difficulties of getting sensible results in a number of subject areas.</p>
<p>“NZQA and the Minister are very definitely running the risk that people will stop believing them when they say all is well,” says Mr English</p>
