<p>Roy Invites Outdoor Recreation Members To ACT</p>
<p>Heather Roy<br>Monday, 27 March 2006<br>Press Releases - Other</p>
<p>ACT MP Heather Roy is inviting members of the Outdoor Recreation party to join ACT, now that their political marriage to United Future has ended.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT is the only party in Parliament standing up for Kiwi hunters and shooters. ACT succesfully campaigned against registering firearms instead of firearms owners&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT supports responsible firearms ownership. We would improve hunters&#39; access to Crown-owned land.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT will not tolerate unlawful blocking of access to public land.</p>
<p>&quot;Enjoying our natural environment is not a crime, and ACT would make sure that all Kiwis - including hunters and outdoor groups - are able to take an active role in conservation.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT is a tolerant, liberal party. We welcome Kiwis from every walk of life.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that Outdoor Recreation&#39;s Board - including former United MP Marc Alexander - recognise that ACT is the only party in Parliament representing the thousands of Kiwis who enjoy the great outdoors&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
