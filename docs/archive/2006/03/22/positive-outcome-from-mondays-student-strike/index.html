<p>Positive outcome from Monday&#39;s student &#39;strike&#39;</p>
<p>News that some school students will be engaging further in the democratic process following Monday&#39;s &#39;strike&#39; by Auckland school students in support of her Bill to remove youth rates has been greeted with pleasure by Green Party Industrial Relations Spokesperson Sue Bradford.</p>
<p>On Monday, students at Takapuna Grammar were urged by their principal not to take part in the &#39;strike&#39;, and were promised in return that three students would be able to visit Parliament to discuss the issue of youth rates directly with MPs.</p>
<p>Ms Bradford is delighted that Labour Minister Ruth Dyson will meet with these students on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is great that these students, albeit only three of them, will have the opportunity to engage further with the democratic process following Monday&#39;s protest action,&quot; Ms Bradford says.</p>
<p>&quot;Direct action, or the threat of direct action in this case, can make a very positive contribution to debate over important issues.</p>
<p>&quot;Other students who did participate in the protest in Auckland will also have had a valuable learning experience about political activism.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Bradford also rejected a call from National MP Bill English that she should apologise to parents of students who took part in the protest for &#39;organising&#39; it.</p>
<p>&quot;The Green Party had nothing to do with the organisation of Monday&#39;s protest action. It was organised by an entirely independent group, Radical Youth, with the practical support of the Unite! Union, as Mr English well knows,&quot; Ms Bradford says.</p>

<p>&quot;I fully endorse the students involved for taking the initiative to organise powerful direct action on such an important issue, and welcome their vocal support for my Bill, which I hope will be taken into account by the select committee, but I had no part in organising it.</p>
<p>&quot;To suggest that these students were somehow manipulated into action by other groups simply belittles their hard work and undermines their passionately held views on this issue,&quot; Ms Bradford says.</p>
