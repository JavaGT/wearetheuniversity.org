<p>Hon Bill English National Party Education Spokesman</p>

<p>Maharey makes a mockery of school secrecy</p>
<p>Steve Maharey&#39;s release of individual school performance data to me makes a mockery of his Government&#39;s attempts to keep this information from parents, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English. The Government has banned parents from accessing schools&#39; performance data on the Ministry of Education&#39;s SchoolSmart website.</p>
<p>Mr English says Mr Maharey gave him the following information in response to a written request:</p>
<p>* Detailed analysis of 2004 NCEA results, including top 10 and bottom 10 performing schools in each decile across a range of criteria, including - proportion of students gaining a level one qualification, proportion of students gaining a level three qualification, proportion of school leavers with no qualifications.</p>
<p>* Teacher Turnover Rates for individual schools for each of the past five years.</p>
<p>* Suspension and Stand Down Rates for individual schools. &quot;If the Minister is happy for me to have this information, why can&#39;t he let parents have access to it? After all, parents have a much stronger interest in their children&#39;s educational progress than most bureaucrats, who do have access to it.&quot;</p>
<p>The data shows that at one Wellington primary school, teacher turnover has averaged 39% over the past three years, whereas the average teacher turnover for schools in that decile is only 13%. It also shows that at one decile 1 school, 81% of year 11 students received level 1 NCEA qualifications, compared with 0% at the bottom eight schools in that decile. Mr English says parents need this information to make informed choices for their children.</p>
