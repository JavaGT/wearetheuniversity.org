<p>Open Polytechnic incites Aussies</p>
<p>The Open Polytechnic has failed to offer any assistance to 500 students who lost their fees when a company owned by the polytech went under in Australia, says National’s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>“The Open Polytechnic has also refused to offer any assistance to the Australian organisation which is finding alternative courses for all those students who lost their fees,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“If an Australian tertiary institution treated New Zealand students this way, all hell would break loose and the Government would be up in arms.</p>
<p>“The Open Polytechnic may be taking a strictly legal approach, but it’s leaving a sour taste,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>The Open Polytechnic purchased Stott&#39;s College and the company proceeded to lose money in Australia.</p>
<p>After losing money for several years, Stott’s College joined an Australian scheme to protect students and 12 months ago the Open Polytechnic put the college into receivership.</p>
<p>“Now Australian providers have to pick up the bill for providing courses for the 500 students,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“These actions will damage the reputation of all the New Zealand institutions offering education in Australia.</p>
<p>“The Open Polytechnic, which is Government funded, should offer some contribution to costs because they must have known the Australian students were at risk,” says Mr English.</p>
