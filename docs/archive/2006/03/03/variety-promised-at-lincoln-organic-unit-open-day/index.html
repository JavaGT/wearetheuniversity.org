<p>Variety promised at Lincoln organic unit’s open day</p>
<p>From potatoes to pollinators - you will see and hear about it all at the annual public “Open Day” at New Zealand’s pioneering organic research property, the 10-hectare Biological Husbandry Unit (BHU) at Lincoln University, on Sunday 12 March.</p>
<p>Coming up 30 years old, the famous “BHU” was the centre of innovative work that brought New Zealand to the attention of the international organics farming movement and made Lincoln University a successful host of the 10th world conference of the International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Current research at the Unit will be discussed and showcased at the Open Day. This will include work on identifying and preserving varieties of heritage potato and other work on how to make an organic plot a “Happy Insect Garden”.</p>
<p>“The ‘Happy Insect Garden’ theme refers to collaborative work between Lincoln University and Landcare Research, looking at ways of optimising the presence of beneficial insects in organic gardens,” says Lincoln University’s Lecturer in Agro-Ecology, Dr Roddy Hale. “For example, we are investigating what pollinators are desirable and how they can best be attracted.”</p>
<p>Dr Hale will speak at the introductory session of the Open Day along with the part-time manager of the Unit, well-known organics movement personality Holger Kahl.</p>
<p>The day opens at 11am with an introductory session in Lincoln University’s Stewart Building, then after lunch the programme moves to the BHU site itself to observe and hear about work in progress. The finishing time is 3pm. There will be signposting from the roundabout on the intersection of Springs and Ellesmere Junction Road near the University campus.</p>

<p>Entry fee for the day is $10 per person, with a family ticket $20 and children under 16 free. An organic lunch will be available in the Stewart Building for those who would like it, at an extra $10 per head. For catering purposes, prior booking for the prepared organic lunch is essential. Alternatively participants are welcome to bring their own lunch, in which case the cost for the day stays at $10 and there is no need to book in advance, simply turn up.</p>
<p>For booking for the lunch, phone Julie Ward at Lincoln University on (03) 3252811 ext 8370 or email <a href="mailto:wardj4@lincoln.ac.nz">wardj4@lincoln.ac.nz</a>.</p>
