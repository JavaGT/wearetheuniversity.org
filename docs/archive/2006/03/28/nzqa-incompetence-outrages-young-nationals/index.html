<p>NZQA Incompetence Outrages Young Nationals</p>
<p>Press Release 28 February 2006</p>
<p>New Zealand Young Nationals: Northern Region</p>
<p>The Northern Region Young Nationals are blaming the Labour Government for NZQA&#39;s continual bungling of Scholarship results, particularly those of students from Auckland schools.</p>
<p>&quot;The latest debacle which has seen two King&#39;s College students pass by &#39;making things up&#39; or not studying is likely only the surface of problems at NZQA&quot; says Northern Region Deputy Chair, Jamie Turner.</p>
<p>&#39;The assertions of successive Labour Education Ministers that they are dealing with the problem have clearly been discredited. When student&#39;s education and futures are at stake, Ministers paying lip service to the problem simply won&#39;t cut it&#39; he says.</p>
<p>Northern Region Chair, Daniel Fielding, is echoing his Deputy&#39;s calls.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite attempts by the Government to address the problems at NZQA, exam results this year have only exposed yet more incompetence&quot; says Fielding.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government seems unable to register the gravity of the situation. If I were Steve Maharey, I would be extremely embarrassed.&quot;</p>
<p>Both also express concern at what this apparently ongoing theme might mean for this year&#39;s students.</p>
<p>&quot;But since Labour Education Ministers&#39; statements now appear worthless, any further assurances will certainly be met with scepticism&quot; says Fielding and Turner.</p>
