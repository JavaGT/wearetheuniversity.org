<p>Working for Families huge expansion of welfare state</p>
<p>The Working for Families extension on 1 April is a huge expansion of the welfare state that creates all the wrong incentives for working people to get ahead, says National Party Finance spokesman John Key.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a massive expansion of the welfare state to the middle and upper classes - even to families with incomes as high as $142,000 and those living in the wealthiest suburbs.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s reflected in Labour&#39;s TV ads. Does it make sense for a family that can afford to text each other that dinner is on the table, while they fiddle with their iPods, to get welfare handouts?</p>
<p>&quot;Michael Joseph Savage would have turned in his grave knowing the welfare state has extended this far.</p>
<p>&quot;In a paper last year on the WFF expansion, the Social Development Ministry said that &#39;the largest gains will accrue to families earning middle to higher incomes&#39; and &#39;the proposed package has no direct effect on poverty rates&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only that, but the package will be propped up by hundreds of thousands of low and middle income Kiwis who don&#39;t have children.</p>
<p>&quot;Working for Families also imposes high effective marginal tax rates on families. These are a disincentive to work overtime and at weekends, and for partners to seek part-time work.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s because high effective marginal tax rates - the amount of additional tax paid for every dollar earned - mean it&#39;s not worthwhile to earn that extra dollar because it&#39;s taxed so highly.</p>
<p>&quot;The 1 April expansion of Working for Families simply shifts the high effective marginal tax rate phenomena even further up the income scale.<br>&quot;The extension of Working for Families will be recognised by New Zealanders for what it is - a last-ditch election bribe aimed not at alleviating poverty but at regaining control of the Treasury benches,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
