<p><strong>Wednesday, 29 March 2006, 4:48 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Bill English National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>29 March 2006</p>
<p>Students more competent than NZQA</p>
<p>NZQA has quietly awarded two additional &#39;premiere scholarships&#39; to students who discovered they had been cheated out of the prized qualification, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>The students were awarded the scholarship after they approached NZQA complaining that the eligibility for the award had changed without students being notified.</p>
<p>Mr English says NZQA shifted the goalposts without telling the players.</p>
<p>&quot;If these two students had not themselves noticed the error they would not have been awarded the $30,000 scholarships they had worked so hard to earn.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a real worry that secondary school students are so much more competent than officials at the agency charged with administering our national secondary schools qualification.</p>
<p>&quot;NZQA should show good faith by apologising for their incompetence rather than making excuses for misleading our top students and trying to hide it.</p>
<p>&quot;This kind of ridiculous and incompetent error shows that NZQA is still a long way from giving a fair deal to some of our brightest students,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>This follows revelations last week that the scholarship calculus exam was so poorly set that half of the students sitting it got less than 5% and students who scored as low as 18% were awarded scholarship.</p>
<p>It has also been revealed that eight students who achieved full marks in visual arts were not awarded outstanding scholarships when, in every other subject, students who achieved full marks were.</p>
