<p>&#39;Labour in a Whirl over Media Spin of Maori Members&#39;</p>
<p>28 March 2006 Tariana Turia and Dr Pita Sharples; Co-leaders, Maori Party</p>
<p>In a day in which the House will be considering the long-term effects of greenhouse gases, the Labour Maori Caucus has been caught in the Maori Party winds of change.</p>
<p>&quot;We call this phenomenon, Te Hau a Whiowhio&quot; stated Dr Sharples, &quot;meaning the whirling around, perhaps looking for a home which will better accommodate their tangata whenua view of the world&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike the ideologically rigid political parties which dominate Parliament - which stick to fixed left or right positions - the Maori Party welcomes all points of view&quot; stated Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a party based on kaupapa, kaupapa Maori, which enables us to search out directions from all sources, just as our ancestors did when they crossed the oceans; to best advance the aspirations of their people&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Rumours were circulating yesterday that the Labour Maori Caucus was calling an emergency press conference at 1.30pm today (Wednesday) to discuss the Maori Electoral Option&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Last night, the Maori media advised the nation, that the Labour Maori Caucus was calling an emergency press conference to build relationships with the Maori media&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This morning, we were tipped off that the Labour Maori Caucus was calling an emergency press conference to discuss Working for Families, Student loans, and rating issues&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday in the House we asked why the Labour Maori Members were being overlooked by their respective Principal Ministers, to act in his absence&quot; stated Tariana Turia. &quot;It is clear that while they hold ministerial warrants, they are not able to exercise the responsibility of State, with the excuse given that they are not in Cabinet&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;It is obvious that today&#39;s rushed reaction is to continue to create the illusion of unity within the Labour caucus&quot; said Mrs Turia. &quot;It clearly establishes how the Labour Maori Caucus continue to be patronised by the Labour Party, and are told what to think, what to say, and when to say it&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been there, done that, and left&quot; says Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be interesting to see if their discussions on Working for Families describe how the 230,000 children living in poverty, many of whom are tangata whenua, are going to benefit from the policy&quot;.</p>
