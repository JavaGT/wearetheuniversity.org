<p>Don&#39;t sell off vital labs to balance the books - Greens</p>
<p>A recommendation by the Otago and Southland District Health Boards to privatise their hospital laboratories raises extremely serious public health issues, Green Party Health Spokesperson Sue Kedgley says.</p>
<p>&quot;Privatising hospital laboratories would be a short-sighted, foolhardy move, aimed at saving money, with serious long term health risks,&quot; Ms Kedgley says.</p>
<p>&quot;Hospital laboratories provide a core health service, and if we sell them off we will lose control of key public health functions like the surveillance of infectious diseases.</p>
<p>&quot;Such surveillance is the frontline in the fight to avoid the spread of illnesses such as influenza, and it would be foolhardy to contract it out to private contractors at a time when the rest of the public health system is trying to prepare for a potential bird flu pandemic.</p>
<p>&quot;Laboratory staff are heavily involved in infection control work. They collect and collate blood-stream infection data and survey cases of influenza to help provide national data. How can we be sure that these crucial services will continue if these labs are privatised?&quot; Ms Kedgley says</p>
<p>If implemented, this move would be one of the most significant privatisations in healthcare since the 1990s.</p>
<p>&quot;Treating public hospitals as businesses failed then too. Let&#39;s learn from history, think long-term, and protect our public health surveillance capacity,&quot; Ms Kedgley says.</p>
<p>&quot;If the flu pandemic ever hit New Zealand our lives might depend upon it.</p>
<p>&quot;It worries me that District Health Boards (DHBs) are under such pressure to not to show a deficit that they are taking short-sighted steps like this which they will live to regret.</p>
<p>&quot;I am also very concerned by reports that health professionals with laboratory expertise were deliberately excluded from the DHB decision-making process,&quot; Ms Kedgley says.</p>
