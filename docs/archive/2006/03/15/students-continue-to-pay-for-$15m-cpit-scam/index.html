<p>Students continue to pay for $15m CPIT scam</p>
<p>Students At Christchurch Polytechnic (CPIT) will continue to pay the price for Labour&#39;s botched handling of the polytech&#39;s $15 million COOL-IT scam for the next three years, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>In select committee last week, TEC Chief Executive Janice Shiner confirmed that CPIT has not returned a single cent of the $3.5 million it was ordered to repay following an independent evaluation of the COOL-IT course in late 2004.</p>
<p>In response to questions in Parliament today, Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen said CPIT would not make any repayments but would instead receive reduced funding for the next three years.</p>
<p>Mr English says this is the equivalent of a slap with a wet bus ticket for CPIT&#39;s management which ruthlessly exploited the funding system, and the government officials who let it happen.</p>
<p>&quot;No one has been held to account. The only people who will pay the price for this scam will be current and future CPIT students, through reduced services.</p>
<p>&quot;In August 2004, then Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey said &#39;where people have misused or inappropriately used the Government funding, that money should be paid back.&#39; Today the new Minister has confirmed that not one cent will be repaid, instead funding will be cut.</p>
<p>&quot;The public rely on professionalism in the tertiary sector and a Minister with the ability and willingness to crack down on bad behaviour but, in this case, successive Labour Ministers have overseen a complete failure of accountability,&quot; says Mr English.</p>

<p>&quot;Michael Cullen should make an example of CPIT and show that organisations that cannot be trusted to make sensible decisions with taxpayers&#39; money will not get away with it.&quot;</p>
<p>The Tertiary Education Commission&#39;s report into CPIT found that:</p>
<p>* The polytech had deliberately exploited funding loopholes.</p>
<p>* 13,000 of the 18,000 enrolments did not fit the Government&#39;s funding criteria.</p>
<p>* Just 3% of students were known to have completed the course.</p>
<p>* The state payment for the course was so large that CPIT made a profit of 92 cents in every dollar of taxpayer revenue it received.</p>
