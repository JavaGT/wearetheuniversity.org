<p>Articles</p>
<p>What’s wrong with Keynesian economics?</p>
<p>published in the Otago Daily Times, 24 February, 2006</p>
<p>by Roger Kerr (Business Roundtable executive director)</p>
<p>Modern economic thinking has moved a long way from Keynesianism. It has rehabilitated the notion that involuntary unemployment results from the failure of economies to adjust flexibly to government- or market-induced shocks. The supply side of an economy - its productive capability and efficiency - not the demand side, is what matters most.</p>
<p>The itch to regulate broadband</p>
<p>Published in the Dominion Post, 20 February, 2006</p>
<p>by Rob McLeod (a director of Telecom and chairman of the Business Roundtable)</p>

<p>by Douglas Myers</p>
<p>Doug Myers, the exiled eminence grise of the Business Roundtable, reflects on two decades of economic advocacy with this polemic on the state of the country, the Government, the media and the New Zealand Herald.</p>

<p>ARC rating claims exposed</p>
<p>Published in The Independent, 1 February, 2006</p>
<p>by Roger Kerr</p>
<p>The Auckland Regional Council&#39;s claim that the business sector benefits more than proportionately from its services has been exposed as groundless by two recent reports.</p>
<p>Reality breaks through with axing of carbon tax</p>
<p>Published in the Otago Daily Times, 27 January, 2006</p>
<p>by Roger Kerr</p>
<p>The government’s decision to scrap the proposed carbon tax marks another (and more positive) phase in a sorry saga of policy making on climate change.</p>

<p>by John Roskam</p>

<p>Green lies</p>
