<p>Unions Campaigning To End Low Wages</p>
<p>&quot;Union campaigns such as SuperSizeMyPay, Healthy Pay for Healthy Hospitals and Fair Share in Aged Care, are showing workers that to get a fair deal at work they need to bargain collectively in unions,&quot; said Carol Beaumont, Council of Trade Unions Secretary today.</p>
<p>Many unions were planning special events to mark International Women&#39;s Day this coming Wednesday, in recognition of the many thousands of working women in New Zealand whose work is undervalued and underpaid, Carol Beaumont said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Service &amp; Food Workers Union (SFWU) will launch Healthy Pay for Healthy Hospitals in District Health Boards, which is seeking a fair living wage and a single national collective agreement for the cleaners, orderlies and service workers in New Zealand&#39;s public hospitals.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aged care workers are sending their payslips to the Prime Minister highlighting the rock bottom pay rates in aged care, as part of the New Zealand Nurses Organisation and SFWU Grow to Win / Fair Share in Aged Care campaign,&quot; said Carol Beaumont.</p>
<p>&quot;Workers in industries such as cleaning, aged care, fast food and retail are often on, or close to, minimum wage levels and so unions are also campaigning for a $12 minimum wage and the removal of youth rates, which will make a real difference to the incomes of these workers,&quot; said Carol Beaumont.</p>
