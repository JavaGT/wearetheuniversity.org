<p>MEDIA RELEASE<br>YOUNG NATS</p>
<p>20 MARCH 2006</p>
<p>Greens get even sillier with call to students to wag class</p>
<p>“Green MP Sue Bradford’s call for school children to wag class to protest for her youth wages Bill is a typically silly gesture,” says Young Nats President Michael Mabbett.</p>
<p>“Of course it is inevitable that students occasionally skip school. It has happened for generations and will probably continue to do so. But when it’s encouraged by a member of parliament something is seriously wrong.</p>
<p>“Ms Bradford is encouraging students to ignore their education so that a protest for her Bill looks good on TV. She is sending the message that it’s okay to break the rules if it’s for a cause she agrees with,” Mr Mabbett says.</p>
<p>“Youth wages naturally concern students because some of them will be receiving them. However most students are working to save up for things they will need later in life, such as university or polytech fees. Going to school is a far better way for them to get ahead than yelling at a McDonalds outlet.</p>
<p>“Curiously, the Greens won’t let parents have the final say over where their children go to school. However they’re perfectly happy to tell students not to even attend school if one of their MPs is out banging pots and pans. Frankly, if students missed class every time a Green MP protested about something, they would never go to school,” Mr Mabbett says.</p>
<p>“The Greens will struggle to speak with any authority about education policy if they continue to do things like this.”</p>
