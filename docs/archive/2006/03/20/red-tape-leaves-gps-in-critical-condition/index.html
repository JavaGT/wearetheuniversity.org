<p>Red Tape Leaves GPs In Critical Condition</p>
<p>Heather Roy<br>Monday, 20 March 2006<br>Press Releases - Health</p>
<p>A new report from the College of GPs warning that nearly a third of family doctors are looking to change jobs within five years is not the first warning about the critical condition of general practice, says ACT Health spokesman, Heather Roy.</p>
<p>&quot;Professional medical groups have warned of a worsening situation for many years&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry of Health has given up trying to solve workforce issues - the Health Workforce Advisory Committee needs to stop sitting on its hands, actively identify the problems that exist, and find more effective ways of recruiting new staff.</p>
<p>&quot;After four years of meetings, and no recommendations, the Minister of Health should be seriously considering the validity of this group.</p>
<p>&quot;The red tape that holds back all small businesses also punishes general practitioners, and now they have to grapple with the added bureaucracy of Labour&#39;s Primary Health Organisations.</p>
<p>&quot;No wonder many doctors are reporting that they want out and medical students are shying away from General Practice.</p>
<p>&quot;GP shortages are prevalent in rural areas, but the situation is getting worse in urban practices, which have traditionally had fewer problems attracting medical staff.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour needs to offer more than bluff and bluster on workforce planning. We simply cannot afford to have our health workforce in terminal decline&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
