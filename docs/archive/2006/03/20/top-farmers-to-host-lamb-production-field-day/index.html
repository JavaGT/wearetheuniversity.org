<p>Top farming couple to host lamb production and finishing field day</p>
<p>A farmers’ field day in Tapanui, West Otago, on 31 March, gives South Island lamb producers and finishers a chance to learn from the best.</p>
<p>The 2005 Lincoln University Foundation/Rabobank Farmer of the Year winners, Nelson and Fiona Hancox of Kowhai Downs are hosting the day, which starts at 1.30pm in the West Otago Community Centre, Tapanui.</p>
<p>The couple won the award in December under the competition’s 2005 category of Lamb Producers and Finishers.</p>
<p>After a welcome and introduction at the centre participants move to the Hancox’s 441-hectare property for a farm tour and discussion on points of interest. The audience then returns to the Tapanui Gun Club for a final summing up, followed by a barbecue and refreshments courtesy of Rabobank and the Lincoln University Foundation, with meat provided by PPCS.</p>
<p>Innovation and attention to detail were the key factors that carried Nelson and Fiona to success in the farmer of the year competition, says Rosemary Acland, Chair of the Lincoln University Foundation.</p>
<p>“At Kowhai Downs they maximise lamb production for a high net profit through a simple all grass wintering system and efficient ewes,” she said. “They also have a great balance in their lives, between family, work and community service.</p>
<p>“Nelson and Fiona are yet another farming couple from the deep south who have carried off the Foundation’s prestigious Farmer of the Year title and the valuable overseas travel award that goes with it.</p>

<p>“Over the 23 years of the competition there have been seven winners from the Southland/South Otago region.”</p>
<p>Brent Irving, the Rabobank Rural Manager who encouraged Nelson and Fiona Hancox to enter the competition, says: “I find it pleasing to see such a progressive farming family win this prestigious award and I wish them well for their overseas visit.”</p>
<p>The day will be held wet or fine. No RSVPs are necessary simply turn up at the West Otago Community Centre, Tapanui, at 1.30pm on 31 March. Please bring a 4WD if available.</p>
