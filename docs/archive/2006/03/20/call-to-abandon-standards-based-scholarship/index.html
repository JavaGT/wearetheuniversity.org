<p>Call to abandon standards-based scholarship</p>
<p>The Government must abandon standards-based assessment for scholarship, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>He is commenting on revelations about one exam where almost half of the candidates scored less than 5%, and candidates scoring 18% were scaled up to a pass.</p>
<p>&quot;Scholarship has been improved this year but these revelations show they haven&#39;t gone far enough.</p>
<p>&quot;It is also clear that NZQA assurances cannot be relied on.</p>
<p>&quot;NZQA and Steve Maharey told the public that no stone would be left unturned in an effort to get scholarship right after last year&#39;s debacle.</p>
<p>&quot;But problems with biology, statistics and calculus have forced NZQA to reintroduce extensive scaling which they have always regarded as the worst aspect of the old system.</p>
<p>&quot;Investigation into these problems has also revealed that the Government&#39;s moves to fix scholarship came too late to change the exam&#39;s questions, which were set more than 18 months ago with a different selection system in mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Students and teachers thought they were getting a new deal in scholarship, but that will have to wait till next year.</p>
<p>&quot;The next step is to abandon the silly pretence that scholarship is a standards-based exam and do the job properly using traditional scholarship marking and selection,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Students have every right to be frustrated about these latest revelations.&quot;</p>
