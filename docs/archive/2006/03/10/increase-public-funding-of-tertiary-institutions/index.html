<p>Increase public funding of tertiary institutions - Greens</p>
<p>A report showing that New Zealand universities are significantly under-funded compared to their international counterparts should be a wake-up call to the Government to increase public funding of tertiary institutions, Green Party Education Spokesperson Metiria Turei says.</p>
<p>A report release yesterday by the Association of University Staff (AUS) and the New Zealand Vice Chancellors&#39; Committee (NZVCC) reveals that government funding makes up only 38 percent of New Zealand university income, compared to 46 percent in comparable Australian universities. It also shows that staff salaries are up to 36 percent higher in Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greens have been saying for years that inadequate government funding is leaving institutions in serious financial danger and threatening the quality of the education they can offer to students. This report confirms that these concerns are pressing and valid,&quot; Mrs Turei says.</p>
<p>&quot;While public funding continues to be so inadequate, institutions will seek to raise funds instead by increasing student fees.</p>
<p>&quot;We support moves - like the fee maxima - to cap fee increases for students, but the Government must recognise that until tertiary institutions are publicly funded at an adequate level, they will either seek ways around the maxima or the quality of services they offer will suffer. Neither of these outcomes is acceptable,&quot; Mrs Turei says.</p>
