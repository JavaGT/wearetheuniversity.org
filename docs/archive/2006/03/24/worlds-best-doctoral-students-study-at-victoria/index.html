<p>MEDIA RELEASE<br>23 March 2006</p>
<p>World’s best doctoral students to study at Victoria</p>
<p>Seven of the world’s top international postgraduate students have been awarded scholarships to study at Victoria University this year.</p>
<p>Selected by an academic panel administered by the Education New Zealand Trust, a further 33 doctoral students will study at the seven other New Zealand universities as part of the New Zealand International Postgraduate Research Scholarships programme.</p>
<p>Announcing the scholarships yesterday, Minister for Tertiary Education, the Hon Dr Michael Cullen said the combined talent of these 40 exceptional doctoral students would be a real ‘brain gain’ for New Zealand.</p>
<p>Victoria University Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research), Professor Neil Quigley agrees, saying the arrival of the seven students to Victoria will contribute significantly to the University’s recognised research strengths.</p>
<p>“These students bring an important cross-cultural and international flavour to their research which is of benefit to both the host university and the wider academic research community.</p>
<p>“It will be a privilege to have them studying with us and we look forward to their starting throughout the year.”</p>
<p>The students studying at Victoria come from Canada; Germany (3); Hong Kong; and the USA (2) and will be studying a range of specialities.</p>
<p>Their research interests include: criminal deportees into Samoa and Tonga; Tuatara reproductive ecology; cross-cultural adaptation of international students; patterns of Scottish settler identities in New Zealand; the role of information technology in facilitating inter-organisational transfer; a cultural and linguistic study of Witi Ihimaera’s novel ‘Whale Rider’ and of Nikki Caro’s subsequent film adaptation; and fungal toxins that may have potential for development as therapeutics, including antivirals.</p>
<p>The students are funded under the New Zealand International Doctoral Research Scholarships programme for three years of PhD study.</p>
