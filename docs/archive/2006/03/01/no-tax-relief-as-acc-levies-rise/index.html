<p>No Tax Relief As ACC Levies Rise</p>
<p>Rodney Hide Wednesday, 1 March 2006 Press Releases - Taxation</p>
<p>Michael Cullen delivered a slap to working New Zealanders when appearing before the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee this morning by ruling out income tax cuts, says ACT Leader Rodney Hide.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year thousands of Kiwi workers voted for lower taxes, but Michael Cullen has ruled out reducing the 39% top tax rate in the 2006 budget&quot;, Rodney Hide said.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead, government plans to pocket even more of their income, as ACC levies have risen 8.3% in the year to April 2006.</p>
<p>&quot;A cut to business tax in this budget would be welcome, but it&#39;s income tax which discourages work and drives many of our best and brightest overseas.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Cullen insists that the economy is going great guns. Huge surpluses mean that the money is available.</p>
<p>&quot;Lower, flatter tax rates provide incentives for people to work and produce, and would increase the prosperity of all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;By ruling out income tax cuts in the face of rising ACC costs, Dr Cullen has confirmed that there will be no relief for struggling Kiwi workers under Labour&quot;, Mr Hide said.</p>
