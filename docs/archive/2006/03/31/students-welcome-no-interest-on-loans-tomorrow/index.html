<p>Students welcome no interest on loans tomorrow</p>
<p>Students and graduates will be welcoming the introduction of no interest on student loans when the policy changes come into effect tomorrow.</p>
<p>&quot;The changes that bring in no interest on student loans are a real positive move for New Zealand,&quot; said Conor Roberts, Co-president of the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>&quot;For over a decade, students have been highlighting the negative effects of the student loan scheme, particularly the crippling effects of the interest rate, and it is great to see Labour&#39;s response to this problem become a reality.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cutting interest from student loans will mean that graduates will be able to pay off their loan faster, more likely to keep their skills in New Zealand, start a family sooner and buy a house quicker.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a positive policy, not just for students and graduates, but for the whole community.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is also good to see the government recognising the value of volunteering abroad with the announcement of a list of overseas volunteer organisations which graduates can work for and still get the benefit of not having debt pile up because of the interest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We would also like to extend a welcome to those graduates who will be returning to our shores because of the amnesty on interest that comes in as part of this policy&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We encourage all New Zealanders to reflect on the positive fact that from April the 1st we have made it easier for students to throw the debt monster off their backs,&quot; he concluded.</p>
