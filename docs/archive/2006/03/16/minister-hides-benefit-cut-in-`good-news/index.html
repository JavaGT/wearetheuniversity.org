<p>Minister hides benefit cut in `good news&#39; smokescreen</p>
<p>A benefit cut is hidden in changes to benefits and student allowances announced this week, Greens Social Development Spokesperson Sue Bradford says.</p>
<p>&quot;Social Development and Employment Minister David Benson-Pope issued the changes in a statement headed `Minister Has More Good News For April 1&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not good news for desperate people needing to go on a special benefit after April 1, because the special benefit is about to be cut,&quot; Ms Bradford says.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m disappointed that the minister not only did not spell out the implications in his statement, but hid them with his &#39;good news&#39; spin. While the special benefit is replaced by a temporary additional support (TAS) payment, this new payment has much more restrictive criteria,&quot; Ms Bradford says.</p>
<p>Under TAS no lump sum payments are allowed, no matter how severe the hardship; a severe limit on paying expenses will be imposed; the system will be much more inflexible and restricts the ability to take account of individual circumstances; in most cases the first $20 of hardship must be met by the beneficiary and the payment will be limited, usually, to a maximum weekly payment of 30 percent of the main benefit a person receives.</p>
<p>&quot;I urge people in desperate living situations to apply for the special benefit as quickly as possible; ie within the next two weeks before April 1, as those already on a special benefit will have their entitlements maintained,&quot; Ms Bradford says.</p>
