<p>Record growth in union membership</p>
<p>A recent Victoria University survey has found that union membership in New Zealand in 2005 increased by 23,290 (6.6%) over the previous year. This is the biggest jump in membership in a single year, since reporting began in 1991.</p>
<p>The survey of trade union membership by the Industrial Relations Centre at Victoria University found 377,348 union members at December 31, 2005. With 21.9 percent of workers in a union, union density is now the highest it’s been since 1998.</p>
<p>Since the end of the ECA period in 1999, unions have achieved a net gain of over 70,000 new members. This represents an overall rise in union membership of 23 percent.</p>
<p>Professor George Lafferty, Director of the Industrial Relations Centre at Victoria University attributes the rise in union membership to a number of variables. &quot;The high profile and very successful campaigns around wages have shown a more confident union movement&quot;, he says.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, there has been a slowing in labour market growth which means people are staying in their jobs making it easier for unions to recruit and retain members&quot;.</p>
<p>The bulk of the increase in union membership continues to be in established unions affiliated with the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions. Membership of CTU-affiliated unions has risen by 22,944.</p>
<p>The Industrial Relations Centre will be publishing the data in its Unions &amp; Union Membership in New Zealand: Annual Review for 2005 working paper.</p>
