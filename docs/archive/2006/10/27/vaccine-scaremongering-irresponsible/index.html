<p>Vaccine Scaremongering Irresponsible</p>
<p>Using the MeNZB campaign for political point scoring is irresponsible to say the least and a former cabinet Minister should know better, says New Zealand First’s health spokesperson Barbara Stewart.</p>
<p>“The time to debate the wisdom of this particular campaign was before it started – not once the decision was made and the vaccine had been administered.</p>
<p>“Many parents would have thought long and hard before giving permission. Those people do not deserve to have unnecessary fears raised about the possible consequences of their decision to have their children vaccinated.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Health has a moral obligation to put as much effort into keeping parents informed of any adverse consequences as it put into publicising the vaccination programme. As parents we will expect no less.</p>
<p>“If there is any health stone which needs turning over right now it is the question of what exactly the Ministry of Health is doing about the growing number of tb cases in this country.</p>
<p>“Two Palmerston North intermediate school pupils have tested positive. This follows over 200 positives at Palmerston North Boys’ High with 12 students confirmed as having the disease.</p>
<p>“The re-emergence of tuberculosis into the community, especially in schools, should be of immediate and grave concern to everyone with the best interests of our children at heart,” said Mrs Stewart.</p>
