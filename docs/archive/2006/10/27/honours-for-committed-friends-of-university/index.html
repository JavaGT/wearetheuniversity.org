<p><strong>Friday, 27 October 2006, 4:27 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Honours for committed friends of University</p>
<p>The outstanding contributions of two Wellingtonians to Victoria University will be recognised in a ceremony this Monday (30 October), when two of its supporters will be honoured with a Hunter Fellowship.</p>
<p>The Hunter Fellowships were inaugurated in 2003, and acknowledge the wide variety of contributions made by individuals whose keen support has helped the University achieve a number of milestones over recent years.</p>
<p>This year, Victoria is honouring Andrew Dinsdale and Adrian Orr.</p>
<p>Mr Dinsdale is Chairman of the KPMG Banking and Finance Group and has had a long history of supporting Victoria. He graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce and Administration from Victoria in 1973, and joined the Board of Trustees of the Victoria University of Wellington Foundation in August 2001. He went on to become Chair of the Foundation’s Finance and Investment (Audit) Committee in June 2002. In 2005 his role was expanded to include Risk Management. In his role, Mr Dinsdale has overseen the annual audit of the Foundation’s accounts and the formulation of a strategy for the investment of Foundation trust funds.</p>
<p>Mr Orr is Deputy Governor and Head of Financial Stability of the Reserve Bank. He was appointed to the Victoria University Council in November 2001 and served until October 2003, contributing his financial management expertise to Victoria. He has also been Chairman of Victoria’s Institute for the Study of Competition &amp; Regulation, a post he held from February 1998-2006. He has provided seminar contributions to the Master of Business Administration Programme as part of a course on Advanced Corporate Management, and is a Friend of the Victoria University of Wellington Foundation, a special group of graduates and friends who give advice and expertise to the Foundation on its fundraising activities.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh, thanked Mr Dinsdale and Mr Orr for their work on behalf of the University. “It’s a privilege to be able to honour these long-serving friends of the University. We’re proud to have associates who are so committed to Victoria.”</p>
<p>The Hunter Fellowships will be presented in the Council Chamber, Hunter Building, Gate 1, Kelburn Parade at 6pm.</p>
