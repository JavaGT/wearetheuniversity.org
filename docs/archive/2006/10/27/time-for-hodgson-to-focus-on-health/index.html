<p>Hon Tony Ryall<br>National Party Health Spokesman</p>
<p>27 October 2006</p>
<p>Time for Hodgson to focus on health</p>
<p>National is calling on Health Minister Pete Hodgson to focus less on his party&#39;s political problems and more on the pressing issues in the health system.</p>
<p>National&#39;s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall, says the Government&#39;s failure to step in and help resolve the stand-off between radiographers and DHBs is the latest example of Pete Hodgson&#39;s neglect of his health portfolio.</p>
<p>Radiographers from seven DHBs say they intend to stop work for five days from 10 November, following strikes in September which saw some hospitals virtually close down.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet Health Minister Pete Hodgson is more intent on politicking than taking responsibility for his failing health system. It&#39;s time he got back to work,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;The last radiographer strike affected thousands of patients and paralysed some hospitals. Eighty per cent of patients need to see a radiographer and there is no one else in the public system to do their work.</p>
<p>&quot;Each time this happens thousands more Kiwis risk being culled from waiting lists as hospitals postpone elective surgery and go into emergency mode.</p>
<p>&quot;The people getting hurt are people who can&#39;t go private and are missing out because of the electives crisis and industrial strife.</p>
<p>&quot;The industrial strife cannot continue indefinitely - the Government needs to step in. Pete Hodgson needs to stop being Helen Clark&#39;s defender and start being this country&#39;s Health Minister.&quot;</p>
