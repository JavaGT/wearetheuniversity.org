<p>Brash&#39;s predictable fall from moral high ground</p>
<p>Don Brash&#39;s credibility and judgement are yet again in doubt after his admission today that he used his Parliamentary Leader&#39;s Budget to pay for electioneering, Labour Strategist Pete Hodgson said.</p>
<p>Dr Brash&#39;s admission on Radio Live that he did in fact pay campaign operative Bryan Sinclair with taxpayers&#39; money follows a week of denials and evasion on the issue, including a denial of the claim just this morning in the Otago Daily Times.</p>
<p>Pete Hodgson said Brash should have listened to commentators&#39; warnings about the dangers of claiming the moral high ground on the election spending debate before using the Auditor General&#39;s report to wage a self-righteous attack on the Labour Party.</p>
<p>&quot;Hypocrisy is a word Parliamentarians don&#39;t often use, but there is nothing else to describe Don Brash&#39;s behaviour,&quot; Pete Hodgson said. &quot;When all other parties in Parliament expressed genuine surprise that the Auditor General had adopted a broad definition of electioneering, Brash climbed onto the moral high ground in a cynical move to bolster his flagging leadership.</p>
<p>&quot;A journalist was finally able to extract the truth from Brash today – he too used his taxpayer-funded leadership budget for &#39;electioneering&#39;. Bryan Sinclair was Brash&#39;s top campaign aide, seen by his side constantly in the three months before election day.</p>
<p>&quot;Sinclair is a high-priced, Australian-based political consultant. On his website he states that he has been involved in many election campaigns and that he was Brash&#39;s &quot;special advisor&quot;. Don Brash needs to come clean on how much taxpayers&#39; funding was spent on Sinclair and state if he will follow his own advice to other political parties and &#39;pay it back.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>Pete Hodgson said Dr Brash also needed to stop lying about the Auditor General&#39;s approval of National&#39;s electioneering expenses.</p>
<p>&quot;Brash has claimed today that the Auditor General approved National&#39;s campaign accounts and has even implied that the AG signed off on the use of taxpayers&#39; money to pay for Sinclair&#39;s election advice.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s a lie and Brash knows it. The Auditor General only looked at campaign advertising, not other electioneering expenses. Don Brash may not have used his leader&#39;s budget to pay for pamphlets, but he did use it to bring Brian Sinclair to New Zealand for the sole purpose of winning the election.</p>
<p>&quot;The Auditor General would absolutely define that as electioneering. It&#39;s ironic that the validating legislation National has attacked all week means that Brash&#39;s hiring of Sinclair is no longer deemed to be illegal.&quot;</p>
