<p>A talking cookbook wins business challenge top prize</p>
<p>A business plan for an interactive cookbook designed specifically for young people took the top prize at this year&#39;s Plantation Business Challenge.</p>
<p>The winning Filosofood team proposed a recipe book designed to make healthy food interactive and fun. The winning idea and its supporting business plan was developed by year 12 and 13 students from Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate Senior School.</p>
<p>The book was planned with school age children in mind. It would focus on healthy food and promoting healthy eating by involving children in food choice and preparation. The proposed recipe book included an electronic button to activate its &#39;talking&#39; capabilities.</p>
<p>The winning team were Stacey Benioni, Elenoa Lua, Luai Maiava and Romeo Aiga. They beat entries from James Cook High School, Mangere College, The Manurewa High School and Papatoetoe High School to win $10,000 towards study at AUT University or Manukau Institute of Technology (MIT) - $2,500 each.</p>
<p>AUT Pasifika liaison Ronji Tanielu and one of the competition organisers says the 2005 and 2006 competitions have set a high standard for future years.</p>
<p>&quot;In my conversations with the judges, they said the standard of presentations and the business plans was really high,&quot; he says. &quot;It was a really close competition.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Manurewa High School presented an irrigation system using solar panels and water in the air and Papatoetoe High School proposed a steering wheel breathalyser that would immobilise a car if the driver was over the drink driving limit.&quot;</p>

<p>Business plans took four days from conception to presentation and were judged on marketability, research, product differentiation and financial viability. The Counties Manukau Pasifika students were competing for a total prize pool of $37,000 worth of tertiary scholarships.</p>
<p>Serra Galuvao from Manurewa High School took home the prize for Outstanding Overall Individual and won $2,000 towards tertiary study at either institution.</p>
<p>Elini Puni from Papatoeotoe High School won the $15,000 AUT University scholarship for her outstanding contribution to the Challenge.</p>
<p>Moneesh Dass from Papatoetoe High School, Brent Matautia from Papatoetoe High School and Elenoa Lua from Sir Edmund Hillary College won the MIT scholarships winning $3500, $3,000 and $3,000 respectively towards tertiary study at MIT.</p>
<p>Manukau City Council contributed $12,000 worth of scholarships to the event.</p>
<p>Competition teams were hosted and mentored at MIT, AUT and the Pacific Business Trust, with final presentation and judging hosted by Manukau City Council.</p>
