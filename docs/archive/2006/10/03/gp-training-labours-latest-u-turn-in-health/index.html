<p><strong>Tuesday, 3 October 2006, 3:37 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>GP training Labour’s latest U-turn in health</p>
<p>Mere months after saying there was no crisis in the rural health workforce, Health Minister Pete Hodgson has abruptly U-turned on his Government’s stance on rural health, says National’s Associate Health spokeswoman (Rural Health), Jo Goodhew.</p>
<p>She is commenting on the Government’s announcement that it will increase the number of GP Registrar places by 15, with a particular focus on rural placements.</p>
<p>“This latest U-turn comes on top of Labour’s about-face on elective services only yesterday,” says Mrs Goodhew.</p>
<p>“First, Labour accused National of scare-mongering on the electives crisis and waiting list culls, then changed their mind and cried crocodile tears for the thousands of patients they culled.</p>
<p>“Now, only months after telling an Education and Research in Rural Health Conference that the GP shortage was a National Party beat-up and he was sick of hearing about it, Health Minister Pete Hodgson has done yet another U-Turn.</p>
<p>“An extra 15 GP Registrar places falls well short of what’s needed to address the shortage of rural health professionals. It is inadequate and too late.</p>
<p>“Increasing GP Registrar places only addresses half the problem. Unless the Government focuses on rural immersion early in training then they are wasting their time.</p>
<p>“Not only do we need to train more GP registrars, we need to have a far stronger focus on rural immersion, and cut taxes to encourage doctors to stay in New Zealand.”</p>
