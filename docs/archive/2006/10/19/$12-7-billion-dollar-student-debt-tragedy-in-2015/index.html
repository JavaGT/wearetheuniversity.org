<p>$12.7 Billion Dollar Student Debt Tragedy in 2015</p>
<p>The Student Loan Scheme Annual Report tabled in Parliament today highlights the ongoing impact of high and continually increasing tertiary education fees in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The report shows an increase in per student borrowing over the last year which can be attributed to high and increasing student fees,” said Conor Roberts, Co-president of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.</p>
<p>“Total amount borrowed has increased from $7.5 billion in the 2004/05 financial year up to $8.37 billion last year. At the same time fees increased on average by 4% across New Zealand’s public tertiary institutions.”</p>
<p>“In 2005 students collectively borrowed $971 million from the student loan scheme, this policy has simply indebted a generation.”</p>
<p>“Labour’s no interest on loans policy is a positive move which has now kicked in and is helping students pay off their loans faster, however it is not good enough if fees are going to simply keep rising.”</p>
<p>“92% of borrowers used the scheme to pay for fees which just keep going up and up. Auckland University recently increased undergraduate fees by 3.7% and 9.8% increase for postgraduate fees.”</p>
<p>“We have also seen Canterbury University hike fees by 5%, Lincoln University hike fees by 4.98% and Massey University going for a 10% increase. These increases simply cannot continue as they force students further into debt.”</p>
<p>“Institutions are passing the cost of Government underfunding onto students, the per-student contribution from Government has dropped from where it was 15 years ago.”</p>

<p>“In Australian Universities, their Government contributes 46% of an institution’s funding, while in New Zealand the Government contributes only 38%. In addition, fees in Australia contribute only 19% of an institutions income, while in New Zealand fees contribute 31% of an institutions income.”</p>
<p>“The annual report also shows the median student loan balance climbing from $10,404 in 2004/05 to $10,652 in 2005/06. Low public funding of tertiary institutions and high fees are only going to see this amount increase.”</p>
<p>“The Government is projecting that in 2014/15 students will owe an astonishing $12.7 billion, we need urgent action on fees and funding if we are going to avert this debt tragedy,” Mr Roberts concluded.</p>
