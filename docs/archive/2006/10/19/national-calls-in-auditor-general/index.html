<p>National calls in Auditor-General over problem gambling contracts</p>
<p>National has called on the Auditor-General to investigate massive overpayments by the Ministry of Health to problem gambling intervention service providers.</p>
<p>National Party Internal Affairs spokeswoman Sandra Goudie has revealed that providers are being massively overpaid for the intervention services they provide.</p>
<p>“The Pacific Peoples Addiction Service in Hamilton was paid $143,160 for intervention services in the 2005/06 year and had only eight customers, even though its contract required it to see at least 300 people – that’s $17,895 for each person using the service.</p>
<p>“Te Whanau o Waipareira Trust in Auckland was paid $186,976 in 2005/06 and had 13 users – that’s $14,382 for each user. Its contract required it to see at least 600 people.</p>
<p>“And Te Rapuora Health Services in Nelson was paid $86,124 and had six people use its service – that’s $14,354 per user.</p>
<p>“Contracts also reveal that people are being counted as clients if they have had a 16-minute phone conversation.</p>
<p>“Is the Government happy to pay up to $18,000 for a 16-minute phone conversation or a single half-hour counselling session?</p>
<p>“You’ve got to wonder, since Labour has given nearly all the providers extra contracts worth tens of thousands of dollars more.</p>
<p>“Taxpayers need assurance that public money is not being wasted and paid for services not delivered.”</p>
<p>Ms Goudie wrote to the Auditor-General this afternoon.</p>
