<p>Phil Heatley MP<br>National Party Housing Spokesman</p>

<p>Labour fuels unrealistic housing expectations</p>
<p>National Party Housing spokesman Phil Heatley says Chris Carter is now reaping what Labour has sown over the past seven years.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not surprising that the occupants of a state house in Auckland are refusing to leave, given that for years Labour has been promoting unrealistic expectations among those who rely on the state for some assistance.&quot;</p>
<p>In recent months National has uncovered spiralling vandalism, exposed HNZ properties worth more than $2 million and released figures showing an alarming number of paying boarders are staying in taxpayer-subsidised homes.</p>
<p>&quot;Because Labour and Chris Carter have been mismanaging the housing portfolio for the past seven years, it&#39;s little wonder that some tenants feel hard done by when the Government acts.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Heatley says a National Government would have tried harder to help the family buy the house at the centre of the stand-off and then reinvested the sale price into more state housing for other needy families.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#39;ve spent 32 years paying rent. It&#39;s a crying shame that they haven&#39;t been paying off a mortgage over that time. Labour should be looking at a rent-to-buy programme.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Heatley says he understands the family&#39;s attachment to the house but agrees that they do have to move.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister says this is not an isolated case. He needs to explain whether this is, in fact, the tip of a much larger iceberg. I have certainly had anecdotal reports to that effect.</p>
<p>&quot;When there are some 11 and a half thousand needy people on the waiting list we can&#39;t let tenants start making up their own rules,&quot; says Mr Heatley.</p>
