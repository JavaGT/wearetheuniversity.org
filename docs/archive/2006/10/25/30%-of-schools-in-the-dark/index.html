<p>Hon Bill English MP<br>National Party Education Spokesman</p>

<p>30% of schools in the dark</p>
<p>Almost 30 percent of schools have no useful information about which of their students are failing, says National’s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>The Education Review Office Annual Report, released this month, says that just 71% of schools reviewed this year had access to ‘good or some useful information about progress and achievement of all their students’.</p>
<p>“This means that almost 30% of schools don’t have the information they need to teach their children according to current best practice,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“If teachers don’t know what level their students have achieved, how do they know what to teach them next?</p>
<p>“Schools which have no useful information about student achievement can’t give parents anything more than bland generalisations about their child. That’s not good enough.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no excuse for schools failing to use best practice. Labour&#39;s softly softly policy on measuring student achievement tolerates sub-standard teaching practice and betrays students and parents.</p>
<p>&quot;Education minister Steve Maharey should move urgently to require all schools to do the job properly,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
