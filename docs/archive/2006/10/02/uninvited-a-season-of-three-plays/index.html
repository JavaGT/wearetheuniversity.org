<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>02 October 2006</p>
<p>You’re invited…</p>
<p>Uninvited – a season of three plays</p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington’s Theatre programme presents this year&#39;s fourth and final season of student directed plays. While all three plays, from students in the third-year theatre directing course, are comically entertaining they each deal with different people and issues that are ‘uninvited’.</p>
<p>Feathers will fly in the musical morality play Rooster Rag, written by Michael Hurd. Francesca Emms directs this theatrical event in which we are serenaded by a barn yard of chickens and one very handsome rooster named Chanticleer. Their joyous existence is most dreadfully disturbed however, when Chanticleer has a most terrifying dream. Set in the frivolous 1920s and based on a Chaucer classic, Rooster Rag is a real toe-tapper.</p>
<p>In the absurdist comedy The Bald Soprano, written by Eugene Ionesco, an English dinner party is waiting to happen. Set in &quot;a middle-class English interior on an English evening&quot; two English couples attempt to make conversation. The nonsensical statements combined with &quot;absence of any inner life, the mechanical soullessness of daily routine&quot; make this play a hilariously chaotic exploration of communication. Directed by Stuart Henderson</p>
<p>In The Red Balloon, written by Damian Trasler and directed by Fergus Jack-Hinton, the question, &quot;what do you come to the theatre for?&quot; is asked. Is modern theatre just too weird or is it a break from cinematic reality? One girl and her beautiful but empty red balloon are about to find out.</p>
<p>All three productions will be performed at Studio 77, 77 Fairlie Terrace, Kelburn. Wednesday 11 – Saturday 14 October 2006. Shows start at 7pm each night with tickets $12 waged and $8 unwaged.</p>
