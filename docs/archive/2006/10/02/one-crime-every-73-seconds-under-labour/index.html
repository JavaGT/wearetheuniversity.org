<p>One Crime Every 73 Seconds Under Labour</p>
<p>Heather Roy<br>Monday, 2 October 2006<br>Press Releases - Crime &amp; Justice</p>
<p>Police statistics reveal that a crime was reported every 73 seconds last year, an indictment on Labour&#39;s soft-on-crime policies according to ACT National Security Spokesman, Heather Roy.</p>
<p>&quot;More Kiwis than ever are falling victim to criminals, with more than 426,000 crimes reported in the 2005/06 year. Leaked statistics were released to the Sunday Star-Times on July 30, suggesting that Annette King has been sitting on these figures for at least five weeks&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;On the average day last year:</p>
<p>* A sexual crime was reported in Wellington;<br>* 100 Aucklanders fell victim to dishonesty offences;<br>* Another 138 Kiwis were victims of a violent crime.</p>
<p>&quot;Since Labour came to office, violent offences alone have risen by ten thousand. In the last year, homicides have risen by almost a third.</p>
<p>&quot;The economic cost of criminal offending is horrific, and there is an even higher human toll.</p>
<p>&quot;Kiwis deserve honest answers to their questions - not evasion, spin or more of the same soft justice policies.</p>
<p>&quot;Our Police do a good job, but they are often overwhelmed and frustrated by a weak, revolving door justice system.</p>
<p>&quot;We should be taking a zero tolerance approach, which means treating every offence seriously and punishing every crime appropriately&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
