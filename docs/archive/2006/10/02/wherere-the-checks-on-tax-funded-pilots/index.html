<p><strong>Monday, 2 October 2006, 12:48 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Judith Collins MP<br>National Party Welfare Spokeswoman</p>
<p>02 October 2006</p>
<p>Where&#39;re the checks on tax-funded pilots?</p>
<p>National Party Welfare spokeswoman Judith Collins says Labour is failing dismally in its responsibility to keep tabs on tax-funded employment programmes.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;ve got hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes being poured into different pilot programmes which aren&#39;t being evaluated. The Minister is failing in his duty to be a responsible guardian of the public purse.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Collins has released the details of four separate employment programmes designed to assist those on sickness or invalids benefits get into work. They have cost the taxpayer a total of $1,172,278.</p>
<p>&quot;None of these programmes has been formally evaluated. Not one!</p>
<p>&quot;How can the Ministry learn from experience if it rejects a formal evaluation process?</p>
<p>&quot;How can we be sure that taxpayer money hasn&#39;t been wasted and won&#39;t be wasted in the future if the Minister refuses to order proper reviews?&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Collins says given the explosive growth in sickness and invalids beneficiaries under Labour, the Minister should be making sure that taxpayer money is being properly targeted.</p>
<p>&quot;If Labour was serious about helping sickness and invalids beneficiaries back into work, they&#39;d be doing their homework to make sure they&#39;re not doomed to repeat the mistakes of yesterday.&quot;</p>
