<p>Fast track trains to the V8s: Nandor</p>
<p>Toll should run trains to the proposed Hamilton V8 races, and the rescued Overlander should be supported with city bus links and station infrastructure, says Green Party MP Nandor Tanczos.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand that the Hamilton City Council and the V8 promoter have so far been unable to interest Toll in putting on trains from Auckland for the Frankton race. This is absurd - the railway station is right next to the track.</p>
<p>&quot;Toll should build on the good will from their Overlander U-turn by talking to the HCC about special trains from Auckland and Tauranga if the V8 race goes ahead,&quot; Nandor says.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greens appreciated the letter and motion of support for our Overlander campaign that we received from Mayor Michael Redman and his council, and I thank them for that.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that HCC and Environment Waikato will now make it easier for Hamiltonians to use the Overlander and the proposed Hamilton-Auckland commuter train.</p>
<p>&quot;We need bus services, timed to meet the trains, to link Frankton station to the rest of the city, and secure parking at the station. Local Greens who were collecting signatures for our petition were told by many residents that being stranded at the station on arrival was a major disincentive to using trains. This can easily be avoided through a bit of co-ordination.</p>
<p>&quot;If Toll can be convinced to put on a service for the V8s, the time would be right for the council to look at building a pedestrian bridge from the station to Commerce St, relinking Frankton to the trains,&quot; Nandor says.</p>

<p>&quot;The V8 Race does have strong support in Hamilton, but the objections submitted to the resource consent process need to be taken seriously, as most of them do raise legitimate concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;The &#39;Greening the V8s&#39; proposal that I put to Mayor Redman in April is about going beyond the RMA&#39;s requirements, but the council also needs to make sure that it adequately addresses the concerns raised within the consent application process.&quot;</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
