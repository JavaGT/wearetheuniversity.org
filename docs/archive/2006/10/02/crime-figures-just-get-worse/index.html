<p><strong>Monday, 2 October 2006, 1:46 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Simon Power<br>National Party Law &amp; Order Spokesman</p>
<p>2 October 2006</p>
<p>Crime figures just get worse</p>
<p>The Labour-NZ First Government continues to preside over ever-worsening crime figures, says National&#39;s Law &amp; Order spokesman, Simon Power.</p>
<p>He is commenting on the 2005/06 crime statistics released today.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has been crowing about how crime is down, but over the past 12 months it has increased by 7%.</p>
<p>&quot;And violent crime has continued to trend upwards since this Government came to power.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Power says that since 1999/00, violent crime has risen by 26%, from 40, 090 to 50,644 offences, with grievous assaults up 54%, and serious assaults up 30%.</p>
<p>&quot;These figures show an alarming increase in the intensity of violence across the community. Also of concern is a sharp increase across a range of crimes in the past year alone.&quot;</p>
<p>* Violent crime up 10.2%, with grievous assaults up 19%, homicides up 31%, kidnapping and abduction up 46%, intimidation and threats up 14%, robberies up 20% and serious assaults up 13%.</p>
<p>· Sex crimes up 8.2%, with sexual attacks up 10%.</p>
<p>· Dishonesty offences up 7.8%, with car conversions up 17% (to 5,611), house burglaries up 11% (to 3,914), and receiving stolen goods up 33%.</p>
<p>· Drugs and anti-social offences up 6.3%, with busts for new drugs (methamphetamine) up 50%, and drugs (not cannabis) up 19%. More clan labs (203) than ever were found.</p>
<p>· Property damage up 15%.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite Labour&#39;s pledge that they would reduce burglaries, the resolution rate has been falling over the past four years. This is all about crimes against people, and it is clear that this Government is failing to deliver safer communities.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr Power says the Government should be very concerned at increases in crime rates in places like Counties-Manukau (up 22.6%), Waikato (16.5%), Eastern (11.6%), Central (8.6%), and Northland (8.3%).</p>
<p>&quot;With crime up in 10 of the 12 police districts it is now clear that the problems are not restricted to one or two areas.</p>
<p>&quot;These figures are an indictment on the crime prevention strategies of this Government, and make a joke of the promises by Labour and NZ First to reduce crime, and their claims that they are on top of the problem.&quot;</p>
