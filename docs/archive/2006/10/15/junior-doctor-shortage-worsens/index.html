<p>Hon Tony Ryall<br>National Party Health Spokesman</p>

<p>Junior doctor shortage worsens</p>
<p>Hospitals around the country are facing huge increases in the cost of locums as the shortage of junior doctors worsens, says National Party Health spokesman Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only is the country facing a GP shortage, there&#39;s now a very real risk that many of our hospitals will not have enough house surgeons,” says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>He is commenting on reports that of expected crisis in junior doctor numbers at Canterbury hospitals, which has managers expecting 26 vacancies. Auckland is reported to have 45 vacancies.</p>
<p>Mr Ryall is also releasing information from the Ministry of Health, which shows DHBs are estimated to have paid more than $72 million last year for locum medical staff, including junior doctors.</p>
<p>&quot;This is another health workforce failure by the Government. So much money has gone into the health system but we&#39;re getting fewer operations and having trouble keeping our younger doctors in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#39;s needed is a focus on recruitment and retention. New Zealand needs to lift doctor training numbers. But also we need to address why young doctors are leaving.</p>
<p>“Clearly, we could offer more competitive salaries if personal taxes were lower. And more respect and trust from central government would help.</p>
<p>A Canterbury DHB manager is reported as saying many of the vacancies will be filled by locums, who cost 50 to 100% more than a salaried doctor.</p>
<p>&quot;The cost of temporary medical staff, or locums, increased by almost a quarter last year, to over $72 million. The cost is up almost 50% in two years. While that&#39;s not all junior doctors, it does tell you that there are considerable shortages around the country,” says Mr Ryall.</p>

<p>“Many ordinary people would wonder why some of this locum money isn&#39;t better spent on basic salaries.”</p>
