<p>Homeownership need not be an unattainable Kiwi dream</p>
<p>There are ways and means of getting more low-income New Zealanders into their first homes, but this Government is lacking the nerve and vision to do so, the Green Party says.</p>
<p>Housing Spokesperson Sue Bradford says she was disappointed, but not surprised, to hear the most recent figures from Massey University showing that New Zealand&#39;s housing affordability was at an all time low.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s totally unacceptable that our Government is allowing the gap between the haves and the have nots to grow further and further apart.</p>
<p>&quot;Increasing numbers of people all over the country have no hope of ever living the New Zealand dream of owning their own home and this is not good enough.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the Government should be more innovative when it comes to implementing new ways of getting people into their first homes.</p>
<p>&quot;For example Housing New Zealand Corporation should be willing to take more risks in finding community-based housing organisations who can provide affordable homes to low income people - sometimes through unconventional means.</p>
<p>&quot;The Housing Innovation Fund should be expanded to increased funding for third sector housing initiatives, not limited to a capped system as at present.</p>
<p>&quot;Housing New Zealand could also be playing a much bigger part making a much bigger investment in rental properties. At the moment there are people all over the country in absolutely desperate need of rental housing,&quot; Ms Bradford says.</p>
<p>&quot;With just a little more vision and a lot more courage this Government could be helping many more Kiwis into home ownership and ensuring them a more secure future.&quot;</p>
