<p>Oranges, vino and two silver awards for AUT ad students</p>
<p>Slick ads for oranges and wine have netted four AUT University advertising students silver awards at The Crowbars, Asia Pacific&#39;s most prestigious student creative awards.</p>
<p>Bachelor of Communication Studies (BCS) students Helena Karlbom and Olivia Wagner were awarded silver for their art direction of a Glengarry’s campaign. BCS students Tim Howman and Bex Radford’s copyrighting skills on a Countdown campaign were also rewarded with a silver award.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first year AUT has entered the Crowbar awards, so these wins are superb, especially as the winning work was created during the first six weeks of the course,&quot; says senior lecturer Paul White.</p>
<p>This year the Crowbar Awards attracted a record breaking 1,337 entries from 23 schools from Singapore, Malaysia, China, Thailand, the UK, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The winners were selected by panels of independent experts comprising creative and art directors, designers, photographers, film producers, film curators and film directors. The entries were judged on the basis of originality and fresh new ideas.</p>
<p>Commenting on the entries received this year, Crowbar Awards Co-Chairman Calvin Soh said, “The standard this year was leap and bounds ahead of the last.”</p>
<p>“There was a genuine effort at coming up with brand new ideas. There was a tangible freshness to the work that bode well for the future of our industry.”</p>
<p>The Crowbar Awards, run by the 4As in Singapore, are in their sixth year and are recognised internationally as one of the premier student advertising creativity and design competitions, with particular relevance to the Asia Pacific region but with a very strong international status, attracting entries from all around the world.</p>
<p>Karlbom, Wagner, Howman and Radford also received highly commended awards for craft in art direction and copyrighting at this year’sNewspaper Advertising Bureau’s Student Creative Newspaper Advertising Awards.</p>
