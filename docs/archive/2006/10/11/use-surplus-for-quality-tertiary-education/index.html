<p>Use Surplus For Quality Tertiary Education</p>
<p>With the Government poised to announce a record surplus, students are calling on Labour to invest the money in quality public tertiary education, rather than frittering it away on tax cuts.</p>
<p>“Tax cuts won’t pay for a quality public tertiary education system,” said Conor Roberts, Co-president of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).</p>
<p>“At the same time when the Government is set to post a record $11 billion surplus, Massey University students are facing a 10% fee increase, two thirds of students don’t have access to a student living allowance, our struggling tertiary institutions are underfunded and the quality of our tertiary education is suffering.”</p>
<p>“It is disappointing that Labour, who fought the last election on investing in public services, looks set to give in to tax cut hype at a time when they should be investing in our future.”</p>
<p>“It is also a shame that the media is so ready to promote tax cuts as the only outcome of having a surplus when they could be looking at other more productive and positive ways of utilising the social surplus.”</p>
<p>“This is the perfect opportunity to invest in public tertiary education. The Government should use the surplus to create a world class quality tertiary education system, where all students are supported with a living allowance while they study and the burden of fees is alleviated,” concluded Mr Roberts.</p>
