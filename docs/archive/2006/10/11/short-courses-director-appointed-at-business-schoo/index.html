<p>Short Courses Director appointed at Business School</p>
<p>Darren Levy has been appointed Director of Short Courses at The University of Auckland Business School.</p>
<p>Mr Levy (26) will oversee the delivery of nearly 300 short business courses run at the University each year for professionals, companies and organisations.</p>
<p>Mr Levy has worked for Short Courses since 1998 and has been Associate Director for the past two years. He recently graduated as one of 55 people on the Future Leaders’ programme delivered by Excelerator – The NZ Leadership Institute.</p>
<p>He will take on the challenge of ‘lifting the competency of the nation’ – a goal set by the Short Courses team when it was established ten years ago.</p>
<p>“We are very much at the centre of training needs for New Zealand business people. More than 23,000 professionals have up-skilled by attending one of our courses, so we have made a considerable contribution to the knowledge base in the business and professional sectors,” Mr Levy says.</p>
