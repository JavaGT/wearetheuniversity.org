<p>Exclusive Brethren Schools Save Government Money</p>
<p>The Minister of Education, Steve Maharey, admitted in the House today that allowing the Exclusive Brethren to open their own schools has saved the government considerable funding.</p>
<p>“Because the total pool of funds for independent schools has been capped at $40m, the enrolment of 1300 students into these schools has not cost the government a cent. Instead all that has happened is that the per capita funding for other independent schools has been reduced,” said New Zealand First Education spokesman, Brian Donnelly.</p>
<p>“The parents of existing students have been hit in the pocket because fees have had to be increased to compensate for the reduced per capita grant.”</p>
<p>“The government has saved itself $1m per annum because previously the Brethren students were home-schooled and received a home-schooling allowance.”</p>
<p>“New Zealand First is urging the Labour-led government to revisit its policy which caps the total funding for independent schools and which creates such injustices that the Exclusive Brethren situation has,” said Mr Donnelly.</p>
