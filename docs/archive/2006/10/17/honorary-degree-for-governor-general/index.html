<p>Honorary degree for Governor-General</p>
<p>The University of Auckland is to award the Governor-General, His Excellency the Honourable Anand Satyanand, an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.</p>
<p>“Anand Satyanand is one of our most successful and respected alumni and his recent elevation to the highest office in New Zealand sets the seal on a stellar career,” says Vice-Chancellor Stuart McCutcheon.</p>
<p>“As a lawyer, a District Court judge and Parliamentary Ombudsman he served with distinction over a long period. He has a well-earned reputation for sound judgment and his ability to relate to people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>“His lifelong commitment to learning and knowledge has been evident in, for example, his strong involvement in legal conferences and continuing legal education seminars,” says Professor McCutcheon. “He has maintained an enduring interest in our Law School, from which he graduated in 1970, and spent a sabbatical period there while a judge.”</p>
<p>Anand Satyanand will receive his degree on 13 November.</p>
<p>Businessman and benefactor Paul Kelly will also be made an honorary Doctor of Laws on 13 November while an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree will be bestowed on Professor Lu Yongxiang, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>
