<p>Auckland University Fee Increase Is Outrageous</p>
<p>Students are outraged with the University of Auckland’s recent 3.7% increase for undergraduate fees and 9.8% increase for postgraduate fees.</p>
<p>“We are extremely disappointed with the University Council’s decision to increase fees yesterday,” said Conor Roberts Co-president of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.</p>
<p>“Auckland’s fees are already amongst the highest in New Zealand, the University shouldn’t be placing an ever increasing fee burden on students.”</p>
<p>“Students recognise that this problem has been caused by Government underfunding of tertiary education in New Zealand.”</p>
<p>“Student debt has climbed over $8.5 billion, with 60% of that figure borrowed by students to pay high fees.”</p>
<p>“The per-student contribution from Government has dropped from where it was 15 years ago and institutions have passed the shortfall onto students.”</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s rates of public funding for tertiary institutions have fallen behind the countries we like to compare ourselves too.”</p>
<p>“In Australian Universities, their Government contributes 46% of an institution’s funding, while in New Zealand the Government only contributes 38%. In addition, fees in Australia contribute only 19% of an institutions income, while in New Zealand the Government contributes 31%.”</p>
<p>“The underfunding of tertiary education in New Zealand is resulting in ever increasing fees, institutions struggling to balance the books, low staff salaries, high student/staff ratios and the rationalisation of courses at the cost of academic endeavour such as the cutting back of Auckland’s English department.”</p>

<p>“Auckland University’s fee hike comes on the back of Canterbury University’s 5% increase and Massey University going for 10%. These increases simply cannot continue.”</p>
<p>“If we want tertiary education to be the driver of social and economic progress in New Zealand, then we need the Government to properly fund it, tertiary fees to come down and University Council’s to stop pushing the cost onto students,” Mr Roberts concluded.</p>
