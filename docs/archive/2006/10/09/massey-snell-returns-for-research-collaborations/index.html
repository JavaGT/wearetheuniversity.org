<p>Issue 18 October 9, 2006</p>
<p>Snell returns for research collaborations:<br>Olympic legend and internationally regarded scientist Associate Professor Peter Snell is about to embark on a series of research studies in New Zealand in collaboration with the University’s Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health.</p>
<p>World-class high-speed Internet link:<br>From internet star-gazing to atom-smashing, Massey academics will soon catch up with the rest of the world with the introduction of a new super high-speed Internet-style network. The Kiwi Advanced Research and Education Network was officially launched by Prime Minister Helen Clark this month, and some Massey staff may be using it by early next year.</p>
<p>Free buses a winner: One million passengers and rising:<br>A two-year trial of a free bus service offered to Massey staff and students throughout Palmerston North has succeeded beyond expectations. It is now being cited as a model for the big metropolitan cities to cut congestion, pollution and road accidents.</p>
<p>Stories of China’s prison camp brainwashing:<br>Literary and biographical accounts of the lives of writers confined in China’s prison camps have been analysed in a book co-edited by Professor Philip Williams.</p>

<p>Nutrition study seeks older men living alone:<br>University researchers are looking for men aged 75 or over who live alone for a study of how well they are eating and what puts their nutrition at risk.</p>
<p>International aviation opportunities in India:<br>The School of Aviation is calling for New Zealand aviation trainers to combine efforts and consider a joint bid to offer staff training for India’s booming aviation industry. School general manager Captain Ashok Poduval says if the bid succeeds there will be significant gains for trainers here and the national economy but the window of opportunity will not be open long.</p>
<p>Janet Frame’s writing evaluated in lecture:<br>“ Splitting linguistic atoms” was how Janet Frame once referred to her approach to writing and propensity for imbuing her work with multiple meanings. The resulting complexity of her prose is not something that should deter readers however, according to senior lecturer in English, Dr Jenny Lawn.</p>
<p>Digital photo competition: Get snapping and win:<br>Massey News and New Zealand Geographic magazine are offering a prize of a year’s subscription to the monthly New Zealand Geographic for the best photograph received this month.  </p>
<p>Winemaker’s bottles new vintage for Massey:<br>The University has launched its own wine label, courtesy of award-winning Marlborough winemaker and alumna Dr Jane Hunter.</p>
<p>Conference to pave way for Te Reo Mäori:<br>Te Mata o Te Tau, Massey University’s Academy of Mäori Research and Scholarship will host an Inaugural Mäori Language Conference in November this year. The conference is expected to be the first of its kind where papers will be presented entirely in the Mäori language.</p>
