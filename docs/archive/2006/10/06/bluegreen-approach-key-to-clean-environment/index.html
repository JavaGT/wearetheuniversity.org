<p>Hon Dr Nick Smith<br>National Party Environment Spokesman</p>

<p>Bluegreen approach key to clean environment</p>
<p>A clean environment and a strong economy can and must go together, National&#39;s Environment Spokesman Nick Smith said in releasing the discussion paper &quot;A Bluegreen Vision for New Zealand&quot; with National Leader Don Brash at Karori Wildlife Sanctuary today.</p>
<p>&quot;This paper is about New Zealand living up to its 100% pure marketing image. It takes a fresh approach by advocating the use of incentives and greater sector engagement in finding environmental solutions that work.&quot;</p>
<p>Key policy proposals include:</p>
<p>* Capping carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation and introducing a tradable emissions permit system to encourage forest plantings.</p>
<p>* A contestable sustainability investment fund offering $1 billion over 10 years.</p>
<p>* National standards and transferable water permits to ensure lakes, rivers and streams are swimmable and fishable, and the resource is allocated efficiently.</p>
<p>* Stopping unsustainable forestry and ensuring imported wood comes from sustainably managed forests.</p>
<p>* Creating new national parks at Waipoua in Northland and the Waitakere Ranges.</p>
<p>* Tighter car emissions standards for noise and pollution.</p>
<p>* Giving hunters and fishers more say in managing their recreation.</p>
<p>* Backing community conservation projects with funding to save New Zealand&#39;s unique native species.</p>
<p>* Instant deportation for visitors who deliberately breach New Zealand&#39;s biosecurity laws.</p>

<p>* Providing financial incentives for recycling and introducing a national system of recycling bins.</p>
<p>&quot;There is fertile ground for these sort of policies,&quot; says Dr Smith. &quot;The Government has lost credibility on the environment with its many policy failures on issues like climate change, energy, oceans, waste and biodiversity. People are looking for new leadership.</p>
<p>&quot;The debate on these proposals starts this weekend with National&#39;s Bluegreens Forum in the Waikato. We have scheduled more than 20 public meetings all over New Zealand before Christmas to get the public&#39;s feedback.</p>
<p>&quot;All this will help refine this package into a firm environmental policy to take New Zealand forward. National has also put the paper on the party&#39;s website - <a href="http://www.national.org.nz">www.national.org.nz</a> - for feedback.&quot;</p>
