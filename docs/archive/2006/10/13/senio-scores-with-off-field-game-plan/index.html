<p>Senio scores with off-field game plan</p>
<p>A call up to play for the Blues in the Super 14 challenge put plans to graduate in March on hold, but this week John Senio joined 1400 other graduands at AUT University’s largest ever spring graduation.</p>
<p>The halfback is graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Social Sciences, following through on a decision he made to keep his options for the future wide open.</p>
<p>“A rugby player, if he is very lucky, has 10 years at the very top level. So the sport is a short-term option,” he says. “After my playing days are over I would like to use my degree to help the youth in my community.”</p>
<p>On the rugby field he had to go up against his brother Kevin Senio, a member of the Crusaders team, but the study has held its own challenges.</p>
<p>Throughout the degree Senio has had to strike a balance between studies, training and travelling overseas for matches.</p>
<p>“At times I was travelling a couple of times a week for training and then again on the weekends for games.”</p>
<p>On-field commitments with Northland mean Senio hasn’t decided what to do with his degree but he says knowing he has options is a great feeling.</p>
