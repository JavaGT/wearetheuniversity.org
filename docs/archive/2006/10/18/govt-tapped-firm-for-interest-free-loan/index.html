<p>Govt tapped firm on shoulder for interest-free loan</p>
<p>Trevor Mallard has revealed that the Labour Government sought out computer graphics firm Right Hemisphere to offer it taxpayer-funded assistance - not the other way around.</p>
<p>Early last month, Helen Clark announced a US$8 million interest-free loan to the Silicon Valley-based firm, which has a base in Auckland.</p>
<p>National Economic Development spokeswoman Katherine Rich says answers to parliamentary questions reveal Government officials alerted Trevor Mallard to this &#39;opportunity&#39; to offer taxpayers&#39; money and he personally invited the company to make a formal proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;Many thousands of other Kiwi companies would be delighted to receive a special Government shoulder tap, but aren&#39;t so fortunate,&quot; says Mrs Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only is Trevor Mallard personally picking winners and side-stepping the processes, but he&#39;s obviously determined that only one company should get this special treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;National is concerned by Treasury predictions that this deal with one company could potentially cost the taxpayer $3 million per annum. The Government ignored Treasury advice that the loan had a &#39;low probability of resulting in net benefit to NZ&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;And Government officials and ministers shouldn&#39;t be searching the country for &#39;opportunities&#39; to give away taxpayer money, interest free, to companies.&quot;</p>
