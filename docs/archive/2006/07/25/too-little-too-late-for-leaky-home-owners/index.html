<p>Hon Nick Smith<br>National Party Building and Construction Spokesman</p>

<p>Too little too late for leaky-home owners</p>
<p>Government changes to the failed Weathertight Homes Resolution Service are too little too late for owners of leaky homes, says National’s Building and Construction spokesman, Nick Smith.</p>
<p>“The changes are minor and will not come into affect for yet another year.</p>
<p>“This is a pathetic response for the thousands living in rotting leaky homes.</p>
<p>“It is just another sad chapter in Labour’s story of ignoring, then minimising and now delaying, an issue that needed to be properly addressed four years ago.</p>
<p>“The latest changes fail to fix the problem of homeowners claiming for legal expenses. It is ridiculous to suggest they have no legal representation when confronted with as many as a dozen lawyers representing other parties.</p>
<p>“The law also needs amending to allow other building defects to be addressed as part of a claim.</p>
<p>“National will seek to amend and speed up these changes to get a fairer deal for owners of leaky homes,” says Dr Smith.</p>
