<p>21 July 2006</p>
<p>Dinner theatre at its best</p>
<p>For a memorable dining experience you can’t go past Dick’s Entertaining Guide.</p>
<p>The comedy cooking show is being held as part of the inaugural University of Canterbury arts festival, Platform (10-26 August).</p>
<p>Created and performed by Richard Till, host of Kiwi Kitchen, TV1’s new series, Dick’s Entertaining Guide is a celebration of good old New Zealand culinary fare. It’s the perfect show for those who find recipes never come out looking like they do in the cookbook, or have trouble finding the right ingredients at the local supermarket.</p>
<p>“It deals with the food that we grew up with, when there weren’t restaurants on every corner and no-one had heard of pesto,” says Mr Till.</p>
<p>Promising to talk about the politics of food and where our dinners come from in “a very enthusiastic manner”, Mr Till says a fun time will be had by all.</p>
<p>“Some people may find my stories appalling because there is widespread head-in-the-sand behaviour about not looking too closely at where our dinners come from. But there is plenty of variation in the evening, from the appallingly awful to the very funny, and finally the delicious as the audience lick their plates clean. Everyone has a great time.”</p>
<p>Performed in the manner of a television cooking show, Mr Till will cook while entertaining and the audience will be fed a delicious meal.</p>
<p>Mr Till, from the University’s Department of Theatre and Film Studies, has performed comedy cooking shows at a number of festivals around the country since 2002. Dick’s Entertaining Guide follows the successful Just Dick It and Dick Does Dinner.</p>
<p>Dick’s Entertaining Guide will be performed at the Old Queen’s Theatre, 120 Hereford St, Christchurch, on 12 and 26 August, 8.30pm, and on 15, 16 and 22 August from 7pm. Tickets are available from Ticketek.</p>
