<p>Talking Or Taking Action On The Health Workforce</p>
<p>Heather Roy<br>Wednesday, 19 July 2006<br>Press Releases - Health</p>
<p>Health Minister Pete Hodgson today admitted in Parliament that the distribution of General Practitioners around the country was creating problems, says ACT Health Spokesman, Heather Roy.</p>
<p>&quot;Surveys by the College of GPs show that almost a third of General Practitioners are looking to change jobs within five years&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;Shortages of GPs are a real problem, despite government pouring thousands of millions of dollars into primary healthcare, Primary Health Organisations, and a committee to look into workforce issues.</p>
<p>&quot;The Health Workforce Advisory Committee (HWAC) cost over $3.5 million to specifically look at this issue, but after six years, has failed to produce any practical recommendations for the government.</p>
<p>&quot;HWAC cost $934,207 last year, when - according to its website - just four publications and one media release were produced.</p>
<p>&quot;An &#39;action committee on health workforce&#39; was announced by the Minister on 26 May. Almost two months later, this group has no members, no name and no budget.</p>
<p>&quot;Finally, the Minister plans to announce progress in &#39;a few weeks&#39;. I hope the progress is more real than his &#39;action committee&#39;, which remains a figment of his imagination.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister needs to take action - not just talk about it.</p>
<p>Funding for HWAC<br>2000/01 $400,000<br>2001/02 $400,000<br>2002/03 $454, 265<br>2003/04 $710,000<br>2004/05 $980,188<br>2005/06 $934,207</p>
