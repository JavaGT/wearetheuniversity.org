<p>Hon Bill English National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>13 July 2006</p>
<p>Govt ally attacks trades policy</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English, says a major union has attacked Labour&#39;s bums-on-seats trades training policy in a private letter to Dr Cullen.</p>
<p>The letter, from Lloyd Woods, the president of the union representing tertiary staff, expresses deep concern about the &#39;dumbing down&#39; of trades training.</p>
<p>Mr Woods was writing to Dr Cullen defending the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Registration Board which was sacked yesterday.</p>
<p>Mr Woods says ITOs &#39;have generally dumbed down many qualifications in order to make sure more trainees are signed on&#39;.</p>
<p>He says people within the industry &#39;are complaining about the standard of graduates and their lack of real skills and knowledge&#39;, and the union backs the plumbing board for &#39;sticking to their guns and expecting highly skilled tradespeople&#39;.</p>
<p>Mr English says he agrees with Mr Woods&#39;s summary that &#39;increased numbers that are not backed up with increased skill levels actually achieve little&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no surer sign that the Government&#39;s skills policy is in trouble when its supporters turn on it.</p>
<p>&quot;National supports high standards across education. Labour&#39;s policies have focussed on big numbers at the expense of sound standards.&quot;</p>
