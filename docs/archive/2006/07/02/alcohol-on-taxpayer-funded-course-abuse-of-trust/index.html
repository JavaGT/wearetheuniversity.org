<p>Alcohol on taxpayer-funded course an abuse of trust</p>
<p>The Minister of Conservation must make sure someone is held accountable for young people on a taxpayer-funded course being given alcohol by tutors and supervisors, says National MP Paula Bennett.</p>
<p>She is commenting after she was contacted by a parent who had telephoned her 16-year-old son on the course, to find he was ‘having a party with the other students and tutors and was quite drunk’.</p>
<p>He was on a Conservation Corps programme run by the NZ School of Outdoor Studies, travelling around Department of Conservation land learning life skills. Three of the 12 students were under 18.</p>
<p>“It is outrageous that tutors not only allowed alcohol to be consumed but actually organised a party and that apparently DOC rangers actually sold them alcohol from their own social club,” says Ms Bennett.</p>
<p>“I understand alcohol had been consumed on at least 10 occasions on the four-week trip, all with the knowledge of the supervisor or DOC staff.</p>
<p>“This is an abuse of trust and misuse of taxpayers’ money.</p>
<p>“The parent who contacted me was appalled that she had believed her son was in safe hands only to find he was intoxicated – and not for the first time.</p>
<p>“Parents had signed a Code of Practice that said no alcohol was to be consumed, so they could have expected that the last ones to break the rules would have been the supervisors.</p>
<p>“This is a parent’s worse nightmare – they put their trust in adults but the adults break the rules.</p>

<p>“After initial ducking and diving, and parents even being told that ‘this is not a big deal’, it is good to see the Minister of Conservation is now involved. He must ensure this does not happen again on courses involving his department.”</p>
