<p>Maharey misleads over science funding</p>
<p>Science Minister Steve Maharey is misleading the public by re-announcing $61 million of Health Research Council funding, says National’s Science spokesman, Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>“His ability to re-announce research money is reaching a dizzying level.</p>
<p>“This funding was announced in previous Budgets.</p>
<p>“And just last week at the select committee it was established that the real increase for the whole Vote Research, Science and Technology was just $19.37 million.</p>
<p>“This is despite last year’s Speech from the Throne in which the Government said science was ‘critical’ to driving New Zealand’s prosperity.</p>
<p>“In the context of Labour’s billion-dollar spend on Working for Families and its billion-dollar write-off of student loan interest, $19.37million is a meagre amount for something they say they regard as critical.</p>
<p>“Steve Maharey is also trying to claim credit for something his Government has no right to claim.</p>
<p>“He said during the re-announcement of the $61 million that research funded by the Health Research Council ‘can also have important commercial spin-offs for New Zealand’, and pointed to successful research by the Liggins Institute as an example.</p>
<p>“What he neglected to say was that none of the 11 applications by the Liggins Institute this year have received any funding.</p>
<p>“Labour’s spending on research and development as a proportion of GDP has remained unchanged since they came into office.</p>
<p>“Their rhetoric does not match what they are doing in practice.”</p>
