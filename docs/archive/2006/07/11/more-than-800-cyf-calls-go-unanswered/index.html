<p><strong>Tuesday, 11 July 2006, 5:57 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Anne Tolley MP National&#39;s Associate Welfare (CYFS) Spokeswoman</p>
<p>11 July 2006</p>
<p>More than 800 CYF calls go unanswered</p>
<p>The National Party&#39;s Associate Welfare spokeswoman says the Auckland man put on hold at CYFS for ten minutes after ringing twice with an &#39;urgent&#39; tip-off does not appear to be an isolated case.</p>
<p>&quot;The perseverance of this Auckland electrician needs to be applauded. Unfortunately other New Zealanders who witness suspected child abuse are not as patient,&quot; says Anne Tolley.</p>
<p>She is commenting on reports today where the electrician attempted to report a mother who was &#39;yelling, ranting and roughly shoving her two pre-school children&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;Agreed, this may not be the most serious case on CYF books, but we all know violent behaviour can escalate over time. This has all the hallmarks of the &#39;lost&#39; Ron Burrows phone call to CYF, when he warned of the risk of abuse to his daughter, Coral-Ellen.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Tolley has released figures showing thousands of calls are still not getting answered at CYF National Call Centre, despite an improvement over the past six months.</p>
<p>&quot;The number of abandoned calls has reduced considerably. They needed to. The statistics were appalling, with almost 41,000 calls abandoned last year.</p>
<p>&quot;But, despite an improvement, we still have more than 800 calls a month going unanswered. &quot;Labour is busy telling the community to take responsibility and report suspected abuse. But surely it&#39;s the Government&#39;s responsibility to make sure there&#39;s someone who will pick up the phone,&quot; says Mrs Tolley.</p>
