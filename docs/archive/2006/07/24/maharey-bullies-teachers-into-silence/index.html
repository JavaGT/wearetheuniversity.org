<p>Maharey bullies teachers into silence</p>
<p>Teachers will be scared to speak out about the problems they have managing severe behavioural problems in the classroom because of the Education Minister&#39;s blind adherence to political correctness, says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>“Every day teachers work hard to manage a whole range of social problems on behalf of the community.</p>
<p>“Now, Labour is telling them they have to grin and bear it.</p>
<p>“Steve Maharey’s ridiculous statement about National’s position is exactly the sort of bullying behaviour from him that stops sensible discussion about a serious issue.”</p>
<p>Research by Professor John Hattie of Auckland University shows that the most negative effect on a student’s learning is disruptive behaviour in the classroom.</p>
<p>“Mr Maharey and the Principals Federation should be listening to teachers and taking note of the research instead of attacking me for raising the issue,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“It’s notable that the NZEI and the PPTA have not supported their attempts to paint the genuine concerns of classroom teachers as extremist views.</p>
<p>“Mainstreaming has had positive effects but it’s time for a more flexible attitude that balances the rights of all children, and gives teachers a fair chance to do what we ask them to do. It’s time to move back to common sense.</p>
<p>“It’s time we stopped pretending that teachers can teach much of the curriculum at all when they are up to their ears with social behavioral problems.</p>
<p>“National will offer teachers a better chance to do the job of teaching, not social working,” says Mr English.</p>
