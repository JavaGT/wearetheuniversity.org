<p>Leading psychology professor to visit Victoria</p>
<p>A former award-winning professional magician who is also one of Britain’s leading psychologists is to speak at Victoria University next week.</p>
<p>Professor Richard Wiseman, from the University of Hertfordshire, will be giving a seminar on ‘Psychology and the Paranormal’ on Monday, 10 July. He has published over 40 papers in academic journals and gained a reputation for research into unusual areas of psychology.</p>
<p>The talk will discuss why people believe in the impossible, and whether evidence supports their beliefs. It will include work relating to the possible existence of extra-sensory perception (ESP), ghosts, and fire-walking.</p>
<p>He will also be performing at an evening event held by British Council New Zealand on 11 July at the Paramount Theatre, providing an insight into certain intricacies of human behaviour such as laughter, luck and deception.</p>
<p>Dr Ann Weatherall, a Senior Lecturer in the School of Psychology, says it is exciting to have Professor Wiseman visiting.</p>
<p>“Professor Wiseman is one of the most colourful academics in the field. His work has been featured on over 150 television programmes and he is the psychologist most often quoted in the British media. We are looking forward to what will no doubt be a very entertaining and popular seminar.”</p>
<p>Professor Wiseman’s seminar is open to the public and will be held on 10 July at 12 noon in the Hunter Council Chamber, Hunter Building, Kelburn Parade.</p>
