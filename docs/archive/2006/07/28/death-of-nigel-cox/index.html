<p><strong>Friday, 28 July 2006, 3:55 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Press">Victoria University Press</a></strong></p>
<p>It is with great sadness that Victoria University Press wishes to advise that Nigel Cox passed away early Friday morning 28 July 2006.</p>
<p>One of New Zealand&#39;s best writers, Nigel was recognised at the Montana New Zealand Book Awards on Monday evening when his novel &quot;Responsibility&quot; was named a runner-up for the Fiction Award. Nigel&#39;s eloquent and moving acceptance speech was met with a standing ovation from his family, friends and colleagues in the writing, publishing and bookselling community.</p>
<p>Author of five published novels, &quot;Waiting for Einstein&quot;, &quot;Dirty Work&quot;, &quot;Skylark Lounge&quot;, &quot;Tarzan Presley&quot; and &quot;Responsibility&quot;, Nigel had recently completed a wonderful new book called &quot;The Cowboy Dog&quot; which Victoria University Press are proud to publish later in the year.</p>
<p>Nigel is survived by his wife Susanna Andrew and their children, Kate, Andrew-Jack and Frank.</p>
<p>Nigel&#39;s funeral will be held at 2pm on Monday 31 July at St. Joseph&#39;s Catholic Church, Brougham St. Mt Victoria, Wellington. In lieu of flowers donations can be made to the &quot;Nigel Cox&#39;s Children&#39;s Trust&quot; c/- Unity Books, 57 Willis St. Wellington and Unity Books, 19 High St. Auckland.</p>
<p>Nigel has been a great friend to all of us at Victoria University Press and we will miss him more than words can say.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
