<p>University of Canterbury Students Fees Protest Brings Success</p>
<p>Students protesting at the University of Canterbury yesterday were successful in delaying domestic fee setting that had been scheduled for yesterday’s university council meeting. Issues arose when UC management rescheduled fee setting from September to July, giving Canterbury students only thirteen days’ notice of the change.</p>
<p>University of Canterbury Students’ Association (UCSA) Warren Poh said he was pleased UC Vice-Chancellor Roy Sharp had listened to and acted upon the students’ complaints over UC management’s lack of consultation. “Professor Sharp showed he was willing to heed the students’ calls for domestic fee setting to be delayed,” said Poh. “We are pleased he has recognised the importance of consultation with students over issues that will directly affect them”.</p>
<p>Poh was also thrilled with the response from students, of whom approximately 1700 attended a rally to protest UC management’s actions. “Students today are often accused of apathy, and of not taking an active interest in issues that affect them”, said Poh. “Yesterday proved students are as willing as ever to stand up and make their voices heard on important issues.”</p>
