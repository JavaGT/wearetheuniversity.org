<p>Hon Bill English<br>National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>14 July 2006</p>
<p>35,000 students miss out on numeracy</p>
<p>Parents will be alarmed to find out that more than one thousand registered primary teachers are not effective at mathematics, says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>He is commenting on the release today of a report from the Education Review Office which shows that one in 10 primary teachers struggle with ‘good quality of teaching of mathematics’.</p>
<p>The teachers’ registration board says it will not let a teacher in the classroom without the right qualification and only after they have obtained registration.</p>
<p>But according to ERO, one in 10 teachers can&#39;t do the job when it comes to maths.</p>
<p>Mr English says these teachers will be responsible for fundamental development of numeracy skills of about 35,000 children.</p>
<p>“Who’s right - ERO or the teachers’registration board?</p>
<p>“If 35,000 children are missing out, parents deserve an explanation.</p>
<p>“Whoever&#39;s fault it is, the Ministry of Education should identify and retrain these teachers. Current efforts lack urgency and aren&#39;t targeted at ineffective teachers.</p>
<p>“Government policy is to wait and hope but if they wait another year, another 35,000 will suffer the consequences of low standards in the classroom,” says Mr English.</p>
