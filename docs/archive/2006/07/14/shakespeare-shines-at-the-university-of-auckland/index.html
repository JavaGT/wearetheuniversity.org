<p>Shakespeare shines at The University of Auckland</p>
<p>Sex, murder, passion, envy, greed, humour, pathos…William Shakespeare wrote it all. For four centuries, his plays and poetry have captured the imagination of students, scholars, spectators and screenwriters alike. How did he do it? Why did he do it? Did he do it?</p>
<p>These questions and more will be explored during The University of Auckland&#39;s Shakespeare in Winter lecture series (July 26-August 30), presented by the Department of English. Overlapping with the series is the Auckland Theatre Company&#39;s performance of Twelfth Night at the Maidment Theatre (July 13-August 5). Twelfth Night will be directed by acclaimed New Zealand Arts Laureate Michael Hurst, O.N.Z.M., who will speak on Inventing Shakespeare during the lecture series.</p>
<p>Other speakers include well-known international authorities on Shakespeare. Professor Dympna Callaghan (University of Syracuse, NY), the University of Auckland&#39;s 2006 Alice Griffin Fellow, will explore whether art imitates life or vice versa in Hamlet and The Comedy of Errors. Professor David Schalkwyk (University of Capetown, SA) will discuss friendship, love and service in Twelfth Night.</p>
<p>University of Auckland staff will also contribute strongly to the series. Professor Emeritus Mac Jackson will tackle the tangled question of authorship (was Shakespeare really Shakespeare?). Professor Michael Neill will examine issues of nakedness, shame, and the deconsecration of kingship in King Lear. And the University&#39;s newest Shakespeare expert, Professor Tom Bishop, will give his inaugural lecture on game-playing and competitiveness among actors in Shakespeare&#39;s plays.</p>
