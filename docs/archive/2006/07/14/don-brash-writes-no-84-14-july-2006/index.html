<p>Don Brash Writes - No. 84, 14 July 2006</p>

<p>I believe, and have consistently argued, that the Government has a responsibility to keep a careful watch on how it spends the hard-earned taxpayer dollars it takes from New Zealanders.</p>
<p>At the election last year National campaigned hard against Labour&#39;s over-taxation and its wasteful spending of taxpayers&#39; money. Since the election, even more examples have come to light.</p>
<p>In response to this I am pleased to launch a new website today, <a href="http://www.wastewatch.co.nz">www.wastewatch.co.nz</a>, highlighting examples of Labour&#39;s wasteful spending.</p>
<p>The website records some of the classic examples of Labour&#39;s wastefulness, including the millions spent to little effect at Te Wananga o Aotearoa, the $26,000 spent on the hip-hop tour and the millions spent on various tertiary courses that had no educational value - like radio sing-along courses and homeopathy for pets.</p>
<p>New examples are also noted, including the $490 million blowout in the cost of building the four new prisons, the $11 million in landscaping of the prisons, and the $1 million given to the 211 phone line pilot scheme where staff answer an average of just three calls a day.</p>
<p>The latest example comes from the Ministry of Agriculture, which spent $14,724 for 40 senior managers to attend an &quot;organisational planning feedback session&quot; at the plush Boomrock Lodge near Wellington last November.</p>
<p>That cost $7,302 for catering alone, an incredible $182 a head for a one-day course!</p>

<p>The website will be continually updated as new examples of waste come to light, and I encourage people to send in their own examples of wasteful spending by the Labour Government.</p>
<p>For too long Labour has been happy to watch your money go down the drain.</p>
<p>You can be assured that National in Government would eliminate wasteful spending of taxpayers&#39; hard-earned money, return some of it to those who earned it, and ensure the rest is spent wisely.</p>
