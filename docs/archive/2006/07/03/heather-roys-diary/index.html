<p>Heather Roy&#39;s Diary</p>
<p>The tragic deaths of twin boys Chris and Cru Kahui has still been very<br>much on the minds of the New Zealand public this week. Radio talkback is<br>still running hot and everwhere I go people express their horror at what<br>must have been a terrible end to their short lives. No charges have been<br>laid but it is widely thought that they died from injuries caused by<br>physical violence. The refusal of the family to co-operate with police<br>added to the dismay and comments by those close to the family such as<br>that the silence is due to the family being in the &quot;mystical realm of<br>tangi&quot; show that something has gone badly wrong in a society that is<br>prepared to accept firstly such behaviour, and secondly such excuses.</p>
<p>The deaths of the twins was reminiscent of the death of Lillybing<br>Matiaha at Masterton in 2000. The similarity was underlined by news that<br>Lillybing&#39;s mother, Terina Matiaha, has had twin sons this year and that<br>one died, seemingly of cot death, at Masterton Hospital on 4 June, 2006.</p>
<p>The Political Reaction</p>
<p>There was no shortage of political comment and a cross party committee<br>was convened last Wednesday at which I represented ACT. There is nothing<br>new about the Kahui case but for some reason it has caught the attention<br>of all New Zealand and at last people are crying ‘enough&#39;. It is<br>the latest in a long string of child abuse deaths, each of them equally<br>distressing when details are revealed of what these infants and children<br>suffered in their short lives. The cross party meeting was more of a<br>government briefing. A taskforce report is due to be published in two<br>weeks and the government has volunteered to share it with other parties<br>as soon as it has been through cabinet. My fear is that we will simply<br>see more meetings, more reports and more recommendations, without any<br>action. After all, we have had a Families Commission for 2 years that<br>has produced well-reasoned reports which go nowhere - our babies and<br>children are still being abused.</p>

<p>My Views</p>
<p>When I gave my maiden speech in parliament in 2002 I said the following:<br>-</p>
<p>&quot;...our current policies are failing dramatically in the social areas<br>and failing dramatically in the area of the family. As a society we are<br>failing to protect our children from abuse. Every day we seem to hear<br>heart-rending stories of abused and murdered children. Their life<br>details are so violent that I cannot read their full stories because I<br>find them too distressing.</p>
<p>To suggest change in social policy means that it is necessary to take a<br>look at the nature of the state and its relationship to the family. It<br>was once adequate for the state simply to provide for the family&#39;s<br>physical protection and the family was left to care for itself. However<br>the state has replaced the breadwinner in many homes producing<br>fatherless families.&quot;</p>
<p>Attitudes in New Zealand</p>
<p>In the reporting of the Kahui twins tragedy there has been too much<br>emphasis on race. It is true that Maori have a higher rate of child<br>abuse than the national average but the problems with the social fabric<br>in New Zealand are not confined to Maori. In fact, the problems are<br>international as shown by this quote from a British book, &quot;The Welfare<br>State We&#39;re In&quot; by James Bartholomew:</p>
<p>&quot;In the crime epidemic, children have been particularly badly hit -<br>often literally.&quot;</p>
<p>The author then reproduced a graph entitled &quot;Babies: the most commonly<br>killed people in modern Britain&quot;. Clearly, we in New Zealand, are not<br>alone with our problems. Some people have argued that murders constitute<br>only a small proportion of total child deaths and that we need to try<br>and keep things in perspective. However we all know that for every child<br>who dies, there are hundreds or thousands who endure severe beatings.</p>
<p>When a case comes to light, Child, Youth and Family (CYF) are asked to<br>investigate. They have to decide if the child is safe in their home.<br>There is no easy answer, as it takes the wisdom of Solomon to know when<br>to remove a child from a family, and the whole area is fraught with<br>uncertainty. I knew one family who lived in a small rural town. The<br>parents were having difficulty controlling the behaviour of their<br>adolescent son and were in despair. One day the son burnt down their hay<br>barn and the father administered a beating with the flex of an electric<br>kettle. The father was charged with assault and served three months in<br>jail, to the great distress of his wife who had no hope of dealing with<br>her delinquent son alone. It is hard to see who benefited from the<br>father&#39;s punishment.</p>
<p>In the storm of commentary about child abuse there has been a demand<br>that &quot;something be done&quot;. One example I heard was Brian Edwards being<br>interviewed on National Radio. He was sure that CYF should take more<br>action and that people should be &quot;educated&quot; on how to care for children.<br>He should have come clean and said that he had no idea what to do. In<br>reality CYF social workers are laden with responsibility but have little<br>power. People are quick to criticise them, and vacancies are hard to<br>fill.</p>
<p>An important statistic in the debate about child abuse is that the vast<br>majority of children who are killed by their own family are not known to<br>CYF. No complaint has been laid with them. Everyone is wise in hindsight<br>but foresight is more difficult. There are dysfunctional families by the<br>thousand but only a few have disasters as bad as the Kahui twins.</p>
<p>Chris Trotter, in his weekly DominionPost newspaper column, abandoned<br>his usually thoughtful approach to speculate who God would blame for the<br>Kahui twins&#39; death. Culprits, he concluded, include the colonial land<br>grab, &quot;thin-lipped&quot; WINZ workers and Rogernomics. He has simply written<br>a list of things he doesn&#39;t like and said they are to blame for our<br>social ills. And he claims that God thinks the same way.</p>
<p>It is easy to lay blame and the authorities are an easy target. Real<br>blame, of course, lies with those who do the abusing and it is to be<br>hoped that the Kahui twins tormentors are caught and held accountable.<br>The wider problem is that of our burgeoning welfare state. Those who are<br>able bodied should be working, drug and alcohol abuse must be tackled,<br>and inter-generational welfare promoted as unacceptable. Until the<br>causes of welfarism are addressed more babies like the Kahui twins will<br>continue to die.</p>
<p>The cross-party committee doesn&#39;t have to become just another talk-fest.<br>We (all parties) could take control and resolve to tackle some really<br>hard problems - such as welfare reform - head on. I&#39;ll be taking these<br>proposals to the table: Plunket Nurses regularly visiting all homes of<br>at-risk families, time limits on welfare payments, easy access to drug<br>and alcohol programmes, 40 hour a week time contribution in exchange for<br>the unemployment benefit and work testing for those on the DPB when<br>children go to school. The time for talk is over and the time for action<br>is now. Lets see if the Labour government and their supporters are<br>really listening.</p>
