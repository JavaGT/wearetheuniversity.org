<p>Six films made by current and former students of The University of Auckland’s Department of Film, Television and Media Studies feature in this year’s Auckland International Film Festival (July 13-30).</p>
<p>The films cover a wide range of style and content.</p>
<p>Sandor Lau directed and produced Squeegee Bandit, a hard-hitting, feature-length documentary about “Starfish”, a Maori car-window washer in South Auckland. Sandor describes himself as “New Zealand’s only Chinese-Hungarian-American”.</p>
<p>Sunil Narhsai is a New Zealand-born Indian whose four-minute short film, The Customer is Always Trite, is a humorous yet insightful look at life as a supermarket checkout cashier. The film is based on Sunil’s own experience working for eight years at a supermarket on Auckland’s North Shore. The film is directed by Greydon Little and produced by Roseanne Liang.</p>
<p>Marc Laureano is a Filipino who has lived in New Zealand for more than a decade. His 12-minute short film, Embers, depicts the terrifying dreams of a young woman in the South Island, who is waiting for her husband to return home from the Pacific War. Embers is produced by Chris Payne, who initiated the project.</p>
<p>Adam Luxton and Jeremy Dumble wrote and directed Ninety Percent, a 10-minute ensemble film about a diverse range of characters stumbling through their daily lives. And their short film, Rope, depicts a sudden burst of intensity from a suicidal man whose life has been worn down to the bone.<br>of intensity in a life that has been worn down<br>Chris White wrote and directed Loose Ends (Executive Producer, Vanessa Alexander), a nine-minute post-modern film noir set inside a towering urban hotel.
