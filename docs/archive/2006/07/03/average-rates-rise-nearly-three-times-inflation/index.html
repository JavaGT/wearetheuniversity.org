<p><strong>Monday, 3 July 2006, 3:59 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>John Carter MP<br>National Party Local Government Spokesman</p>
<p>2 July 2006</p>
<p>Average rates rise nearly three times inflation rate</p>
<p>A random snapshot of 29 local bodies nationwide reveals average rates hikes of nearly three times the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>“The Labour Government continues to heap new costs and legislative responsibilities onto councils without a second thought for the ratepayers at the sharp end of the changes,” says National Party Local Government spokesman John Carter.</p>
<p>A snapshot of 29 territorial authorities shows an average rates rise this year of about 8.39%. The North Island councils National approached are expecting an average 7.84% increase, and in the South Island the figure is 10.12%.</p>
<p>“There are also some long term council priorities being set, and spending decisions being made that will have lasting implications.</p>
<p>“For instance, Whangarei has confirmed a 7% increase for each of the next 10 years in their long term plan - that&#39;s a 96.7% increase over the decade.</p>
<p>“Whangarei home owners are essentially being told that rates will nearly double over the next ten years.</p>
<p>“Many local authorities have become pseudo tax collectors for Labour. They’ve been loaded with new responsibilities and offered the temptation to experiment with ratepayers’ money using the powers of general competence given to them by the Government.</p>
<p>“All those extra costs and added bureaucracy are now hitting property owners in the hip pocket,” says Mr Carter.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Average increase for the 29 is 8.39% (Nth Island avg increase 7.84%, Sth Is. 10.12%)</p>
