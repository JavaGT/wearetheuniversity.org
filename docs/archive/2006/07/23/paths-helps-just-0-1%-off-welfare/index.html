<p>PATHS helps just 0.1% off welfare</p>
<p>National’s Welfare spokeswoman, Judith Collins, is questioning the effectiveness of Labour’s flagship PATHS (Providing Access to Health Solutions) programme after official figures reveal just 0.1% of participants rejoin the workforce.</p>
<p>Answers to written questions from the Minister of Social Development and Employment reveal the programme, which involves recipients of sickness and invalid benefits, has helped just 151 people off welfare at a cost of $2.7 million.</p>
<p>“Numbers of people receiving an incapacity benefit have risen almost 50% under Labour. A programme that assists just 0.1% of those people back to work just doesn’t cut it, especially not at a cost of $18,000 per person,” says Ms Collins.</p>
<p>“Going on a sickness or invalid benefit should not be a life sentence, but under Labour it is rapidly becoming that way.</p>
<p>“With no incentives, assistance or obligations to get off the benefit, thousands are languishing with no prospect of returning to work.</p>
<p>“Programmes like PATHS, which help just a few and cost millions, ignore the thousands on incapacity benefits who are more than capable of contributing to the community.</p>
<p>“National would work with doctors to ensure a consistent approach to the sickness and invalids criteria. We are also examining international welfare initiatives that focus on what people can do, not what they can’t,” says Ms Collins.</p>

<p>Portfolio: Social Development &amp; Employment</p>

<p>Date Lodged:07/07/2006</p>
<p>Answer Text: The PATHS (Providing Access to Health Solutions) programme,<br>the first of its kind in the world, is aimed at helping recipients of the<br>Sickness and Invalid&#39;s Benefit into the workforce by removing, reducing or<br>managing the health problems that are preventing them from working. The<br>PATHS initiative helps beneficiaries identify the health options available<br>for their conditions, and provides access to crucial services that will<br>enable them to get back to work.The Ministry of Social Development can provide the number of PATHS<br>participants who were off benefit, and the number who had declared income<br>at some point since entering the programme, by region as at the end of<br>June 2006.As at the end of June 2006, 31 clients participating in the PATHS South<br>Auckland initiative had declared income at some point since entering the<br>programme, while 67 were off benefit.As at the end of June 2006, 16 clients participating in the PATHS<br>Wellington initiative had declared income at some point since entering the<br>programme, while 27 were off benefit.</p>
<p>As at the end of June 2006, 29 clients participating in the PATHS Bay of<br>Plenty initiative had declared income at some point since entering the<br>programme, while 32 were off benefit.As at the end of June 2006, 8 clients participating in the PATHS<br>Canterbury initiative had declared income at some point since entering the<br>programme, while 16 were off benefit.</p>

<p>Question: How much has Providing Access To Health Solutions (PATHS) cost since its inception, broken down by region and year?</p>
<p>Portfolio: Social Development &amp; Employment</p>
<p>Minister: Hon David Benson-Pope</p>
<p>Date Lodged:07/07/2006</p>
<p>Answer Text: Ministry officials have provided the attached table which<br>shows the expenditure on PATHS since its inception in each of the<br>identified District Health Board regions for the 2003/2004, 2004/2005 and<br>2005/2006 financial years.</p>
<p>The cost to operate PATHS reflects the contracted cost and health<br>intervention expenditure. It does not include any additional costs not<br>contracted for but incurred by PATHS partners; nor does it include the<br>overhead cost incurred by the Ministry of Social Development.PATHS was implemented in the Capital and Coast District Health Board<br>region from October 2004 and in the Bay of Plenty, Taranaki and Canterbury<br>District Health Board regions progressively during 2005.</p>
