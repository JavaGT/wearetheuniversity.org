<p><strong>Wednesday, 12 July 2006, 12:11 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Plumbers board sacked for high standards</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English says Labour has sacked the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Registration Board because of its commitment to high standards of workmanship in the plumbing trade.</p>
<p>He says the board has been punished for its refusal to drop its standards to fit in with Labour’s bums-on-seats attitude to trade training.</p>
<p>“Labour want big numbers through trade training courses but the plumbers won’t allow the quality of workmanship to be sacrificed in order to meet Labour’s targets.</p>
<p>“The board insisted on apprentices passing exams only if they were competent.”</p>
<p>Mr English says Labour believes any attempt to maintain high standards is elitist.</p>
<p>“This attitude will create the same problems in trade training as it has in tertiary education and NCEA – where mediocrity rules and huge amounts of public money is wasted on complicated systems that don&#39;t work.</p>
<p>“Plumbing training has been disrupted by industry politics in recent years. Labour should have let the industry sort out its problems itself, rather than taking sides.</p>
<p>“Other trades had better be careful - Labour will not tolerate anyone whose commitment to quality workmanship conflicts with Labour’s political objectives,” says Mr English.</p>
