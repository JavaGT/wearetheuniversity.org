<p>Labour not focused on waste management</p>
<p>Comments that Labour ‘continues to focus on effective and pragmatic approaches to managing waste in New Zealand’ are pure rubbish, say National MPs Nick Smith and John Carter.</p>
<p>The comments are in a recent report from the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment called ’Changing Behaviour: Economic Instruments in the Management of Waste’.”</p>
<p>The report criticises the lack of progress in obtaining national waste data deemed ’essential for designing effective policy’, despite Labour being aware of the shortfall since at least 1999.</p>
<p>“In lieu of that ‘effective policy’, we have Labour supporting the Green Party’s mad Waste Minimisation Bill,” says Mr Carter, National’s Local Government spokesman. “</p>
<p>“As it stands, this bill will do little other than ratchet up local rates and close down local businesses. In particular, the requirement on every single business and organisation to develop a waste minimisation plan is ludicrous.</p>
<p>“This would require councils to approve hundreds of thousands of plans,” says Mr Carter.</p>
<p>Dr Smith, National’s Environment spokesman, says the bill is typical Greens sledgehammer legislation that looks feelgood but is in fact total madness and a compliance cost nightmare.</p>
<p>He says the commissioner’s report does back up National’s view that prescriptive nanny-state regulation is simply not the way to go.</p>
<p>The two spokesmen say the Labour Government should amend faulty parts of the Local Government Act so councils have more choice about how to handle waste issues, rather than fostering a culture of “compliance cost creep”.</p>
