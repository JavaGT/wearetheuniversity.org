<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>17 July 2006</p>
<p>Victoria University visits Auckland</p>
<p>School principals, careers advisors, senior teachers and prospective students and their families have the opportunity to find out more about studying south of the Bombays at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand’s capital city university.</p>
<p>A recruitment evening will be held on Wednesday 26 July at Auckland Girls’ Grammar School. The evening begins with an expo at 6.30pm where guests can meet and talk to faculty staff. From 7pm, separate sessions will cover the undergraduate and postgraduate programmes on offer at Victoria University in 2007. In addition, from 5pm a special reunion for Victoria alumni will be held.</p>
<p>Before and after the presentations, guests will also have the opportunity to meet and talk to faculty staff.</p>
<p>Representing the University will be Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh, liaison officers and representatives from the University’s six faculties. Those attending will receive general information about studying at Victoria University and living in Wellington and have the chance to attend presentations from individual faculties on their degree programmes.</p>
<p>“Victoria University offers students a unique education in a socially, culturally and academically outstanding environment,” says Professor Walsh. “Wellington’s rich and varied culture adds to an ideal student lifestyle with a host of study opportunities.</p>
<p>“Victoria is one of New Zealand’s top research-led universities with teaching and research strengths in such areas as, bioscience, earth sciences, materials science, logic and computation, architecture and design, business, law, the creative arts, Māori knowledge, policy, governance and social research and teacher education.</p>

<p>“Our location in the Capital is a key to that success as it is not only the home of most of New Zealand’s leading Crown research institutes, but also of Parliament, the Executive and the Courts as well as institutions such as the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, the National Archives and National Library. Wellington is also New Zealand’s creative capital with organisations such as Weta Digital, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and the New Zealand Ballet to name but a few.”</p>
<p>Victoria, which boasted enrolment figures of 20,380 students in 2005, has also made major capital investment in extending the iconic student hall of residence, Weir House, and has recently completed a multi-million-dollar refurbishment of the Kelburn Campus Recreation Centre.</p>
