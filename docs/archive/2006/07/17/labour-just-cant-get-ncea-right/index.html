<p><strong>Monday, 17 July 2006, 9:06 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Bill English MP<br>National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>16 July 2006</p>
<p>Labour just can&#39;t get NCEA right</p>
<p>&quot;Labour simply can&#39;t continue to brush over the serious problems with NCEA when thousands of students are still getting the wrong results,&quot; says national Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>He is commenting on revelations contained in an investigative report published today by the Herald on Sunday which looks into NCEA internal assessment</p>
<p>The reports revealed:<br>- 40% of the internal assessments checked by NQZA are wrong<br>- The results aren&#39;t changed even when the assessment task is wrong<br>- Teachers can, and do, lift individual results<br>- Teachers decide which assessments they send in for checking</p>
<p>&quot;Students will never know that their result was wrong and by the time the school finds out it&#39;s too late to change the results,&quot; Mr English says.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s just not fair to students. And these slack checking systems undermine standards.</p>
<p>&quot;All Steve Maharey&#39;s done is sweep the problems under the rug.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr English says these revelations come just a few weeks after a major report showing students can pick an easy way through NCEA by sidestepping difficult subjects and exam questions.</p>
<p>&quot;The first step to fixing these fundamental problems is for Mr Maharey to acknowledge that problems actually exist. Surely a reliable exam system for our kids is the more important than Labour&#39;s embarrassment,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
