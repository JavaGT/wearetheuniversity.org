<p>Waikato Leadership Centre Builds Reputation</p>
<p>The University of Waikato Educational Leadership Centre&#39;s international reputation for transformation and leadership in education has been further enhanced.</p>
<p>Recently, the Centre organised a national institute, in both Hamilton and Christchurch, at which iNetNZ was launched. INet is the &quot;International Networking for Educational Transformation&quot; arm of the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust in England. This is an international school-collaboration, where schools can share innovation and best practice.</p>
<p>“INet’s focus is on the transformation of education focusing on philosophical, systemic and classroom learning of school transformation,” says Assistant Dean of International Development at the School of Education, Associate Professor Jan Robertson.</p>
<p>Jan said that iNet is already a well-established organisation in England, Chile, Australia and South Africa, with other emerging affiliates throughout the world. iNet holds annual conferences and develops resources that focus on personalising learning and educational transformation.</p>
<p>Jan said that although the iNet initiative initially began, in England, with secondary schools all sectors are invited to join and indeed, did by attending the launch of iNetNZ in June.<br>“INet is an exciting initiative founded by the English government to link schools and education communities internationally. The lateral sharing of creativity and innovation between educational communities internationally is its main function.”</p>
<p>Terry Wood, IT manager, St Margaret&#39;s College Christchurch said listening to specialists such as David Hargreaves and his team explaining their approach to Personalised Learning was a positive and stimulating experience.<br>“It was very helpful to hear about practical, school-based research, as it put the whole programme into context. Coming from a school that is currently evolving and looking at ways of innovating learning, it was particularly interesting to learn about what exciting programmes other schools are putting in place.”</p>
