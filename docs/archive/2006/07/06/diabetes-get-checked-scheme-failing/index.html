<p>Hon Tony Ryall National Party Health Spokesman</p>

<p>Diabetes &#39;Get Checked&#39; scheme failing</p>
<p>The uptake of free annual check-ups for people with diabetes is falling in many key affected parts of the country, says National&#39;s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>He is releasing official figures from the Ministry of Health which show that diabetes detection and follow-up rates are falling in areas such as Northland, Waikato, Rotorua, Hawke&#39;s Bay, MidCentral, Canterbury, and Otago.</p>
<p>Nationally, the number of people with diabetes getting free check-ups under the Government&#39;s &#39;Get Checked&#39; scheme slowed to only a 3% increase last year.</p>
<p>These figures have prompted Diabetes New Zealand president Murray Dear to call for a review of the programme.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is paying a lot of lip service to obesity, but its key diabetes project is running of steam and falling behind in many of the worst affected parts of the country,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand is not making the in-roads needed to get people with diabetes identified and treated. It is estimated that for every person who has diabetes, another remains undiagnosed - that&#39;s at least 100,000 undiagnosed.</p>
<p>&quot;This information confirms that the scheme needs more options for detection, treatment and follow-up.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has put aside several million for obesity projects - some of that might be better spent on getting more care for people with diabetes.</p>
<p>&quot;About 85% of people with diabetes are either overweight or obese,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
