<p><strong>Sunday, 30 July 2006, 11:32 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/AUT_University">AUT University</a></strong></p>
<p>Te reo Maori meets iPod technology</p>
<p>AUT University&#39;s te reo Maori learners now have no excuse for being late with homework - whether attending a work conference in Sydney or a hui in Hawke&#39;s Bay.</p>
<p>A trial group of 10 students at AUT&#39;s Te Ara Poutama (the Faculty of Maori Development) are using iPods to do their assignments - wherever in the world they are. Renaissance Ltd&#39;s Apple Computer Division contributed the 10 iPods for students to use on the beginner Te Tauihu paper.</p>
<p>Many people on the course are working professionals who fit their studies into busy lives. Currently, students listen to and record onto audio tapes in AUT&#39;s language laboratories then hand completed assessments to tutors. People on the pilot scheme who have computer and internet access will now use the mobile iPod technology instead.</p>
<p>Te Tauihu course content and language tools will be uploadable to the Apple video capable iPods. Waiata (song) and karakia (prayer), which are part of the programme, will be available on the iPods.</p>
<p>Volunteer students on the scheme have been selected to reflect learner diversity. Kaiako (lecturer) Hohepa Spooner says the use of iPod technology will improve accessibility and flexibility for them.</p>
<p>&quot;Our te reo Maori learners are no longer attached to a language lab on campus. The iPod introduces the concept of portability with all of the resources on hand where ever they move,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;We are responding to what our students want and making our te reo Maori courses as versatile as possible to get the best possible results. The new resource builds on our growing flexible online e-learning.&quot;</p>

<p>Apple Computer Division&#39;s national education manager Graham Prentice says iPods in the hands of pioneering teachers can be used in ways never dreamed about by the inventors.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s exciting to see a new technology being used in creative ways by innovative educators. Apple learning technologies are enabling computing devices to act as catalysts for new ways of teaching and learning, way beyond being &#39;just a tool&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>AUT University&#39;s te reo Maori courses - Te Tauihu, Te Taurapa, Te Whakapakari and Te Reo Matua 1 and 2 - are nil fee to all learners.</p>
<p>A pohiri (welcome) was held to honour the Renaissance Limited&#39;s Apple Computer Division team at AUT&#39;s Nga Wai o Horotiu Marae during Maori Language Week celebrations.</p>
<p>Ends.  </p>
