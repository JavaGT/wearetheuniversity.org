<p>Unions Look Forward to Role in Tertiary Education Reforms</p>
<p>The CTU supports tertiary education reforms that will ensure that resources are focused towards courses that meet social and economic priorities, says Carol Beaumont CTU Secretary, after today’s announcement by the Tertiary Education Minister, Michael Cullen.</p>
<p>The changes also signal much more involvement and participation of workers, and unions as part of industry involvement in tertiary education and training planning.</p>
<p>“However if this new plan is going to be successful, it will require not only re- organisation of current funding but also new investment. Everyone recognises that the sector is still under funded for what needs to be done, despite increases in recent years”, said Carol Beaumont.</p>
<p>We welcome the statement that these reforms are to assist the transformation of New Zealand into a high wage, high skill, knowledge based economy and contribute to our social and cultural development. It is therefore vital for unions to be involved in the ongoing consultation process of the reforms and their roll-out.</p>
<p>This is an ambitious plan and we commend the Minister for taking it on.</p>
