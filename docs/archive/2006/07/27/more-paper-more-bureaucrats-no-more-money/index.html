<p>Hon Bill English<br>National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>27 July 2006</p>
<p>More paper, more bureaucrats, no more money</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English says students will lose out from Labour’s new tertiary education reforms.</p>
<p>“Labour’s move to drop student-centred tertiary funding hands tertiary education back to the bureaucrats and Labour politicians who made the mess in the first place.</p>
<p>“Dr Cullen has announced a complex new system with more planning and bureaucrats to create strategies, plans and monitoring. As he says himself ‘planning will be the key concept here’.</p>
<p>“We’ve had seven years of planning, and the system is in worse shape than ever.</p>
<p>“This is all about the Government cleaning up its own mess at the expense of student choice and flexibility.</p>
<p>“Labour has proven itself to be a reckless administrator of the tertiary system, overseeing massive blowouts in low-quality courses and no strategy to change it.</p>
<p>“Why should we believe the same people who have created the mess will now turn around and suddenly become expert planners who will get everything right?</p>
<p>“Every tertiary institution thinks they will get more funding out of the new system, but the Cabinet paper states there will be no more money than is spent now.</p>
<p>“This new system will be expensive to run, meaning that the increased costs will be covered by reduced funding for students.</p>
<p>“Dr Cullen doesn&#39;t need wholesale change to stop the rorts in the system, he just needs to focus on enforcing some simple rules about course quality,” says Mr English.</p>
