<p><strong>Thursday, 27 July 2006, 4:06 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon David Carter MP<br>National Party Agriculture Spokesman<br>27 July 2006</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s rural disconnection virtually complete</p>
<p>National Agriculture spokesman David Carter says Labour&#39;s connection to rural New Zealand has now been virtually extinguished after the departure of former agriculture minister Jim Sutton.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour now does not have a farmer in its caucus, or on its list,&quot; says Mr Carter. &quot;Only Damien O&#39;Connor, a former dairy farmer, is left as someone with even a vague connection with the sector.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Though Mr Sutton was obviously a poor advocate for farmers by allowing stupid proposals like fart taxes, dog microchipping and public access across private land, his presence in Cabinet as a former farmer was better than nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;As Helen Clark starts the process of rejuvenating her caucus, we will no doubt see a line-up of fresh-faced teachers, unionists and academics - but nobody with the interests of farmers at heart.&quot;</p>
