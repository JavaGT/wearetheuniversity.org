<p>Putting Ratepayers In Control Of Local Government</p>
<p>Rodney Hide<br>Thursday, 27 July 2006<br>Speeches - Local Government</p>
<p>Auckland&#39;s residential rates are set to rise 13.8% this year.</p>
<p>In the last three years Wellington City Council&#39;s rates take has increased by 20.5%, Christchurch City Council&#39;s by 19.4% and Hamilton City Council&#39;s by 15.2%.</p>
<p>The average increase in rates, across the country, is 7%.</p>
<p>People shouldn&#39;t have to dread the arrival of their council&#39;s rates demand.</p>
<p>First home buyers shouldn&#39;t have to factor in the cost of councils when calculating their mortgage repayments.</p>
<p>Families shouldn&#39;t have to go without, to fund council services they don&#39;t use and don&#39;t want.</p>
<p>Last week I was contacted by a pensioner in Plimmerton, who was told he should sell his house if he can&#39;t pay the rates.</p>
<p>His rates bill is around $2,800. It could cost this man his house.</p>
<p>By comparison, Helen Clark&#39;s rates bill this year will be around $1,600. We expect pensioners to pay almost twice as much as the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>No wonder people often struggle to pay their rates demand. It&#39;s getting harder and more expensive to keep local government satisfied.</p>
<p>People are worried that local government is out of control, and its cost just keeps rising.</p>
<p>My Bill to cap rates increases was debated in Parliament last night. MPs will vote on it next month.</p>
<p>This would limit rate increases to the level of inflation plus 2% in any one year, or by inflation plus 4% over any three years.</p>

<p>National, the Maori Party and United Future have promised me their support, and only New Zealand First&#39;s dissent threatens to stop the public from getting a chance to have their say.</p>
<p>Limiting the growth of local government works.</p>
<p>Sydney and London have legal limits to how quickly they can grow. So do many states in the United States.</p>
<p>Some councils here are already being responsible. Hutt City Council has a strategy to raise rates no more than half a percent above inflation.</p>
<p>But capping rates increases would give relief to families around the country - especially in places like Auckland, Tauranga, Ashburton, Franklin, Kapiti, Thames and Taupo.</p>
<p>The best thing is something it&#39;s hard to put a dollar value on - ratepayers will have greater control over local authorities and local government.</p>
<p>My Bill allows for exemptions to the cap for particular projects, if they have public support.</p>
<p>The infrastructure we need - systems for transport, waste and water - will still be built.</p>
<p>Councils will not need to cut funding for libraries, swimming pools or community services.</p>
<p>It&#39;s councillors&#39; hobbyhorses, personal monuments and council junkets which would have to be cut back.</p>
<p>The upward spiral of rates is unsustainable. All families have to live within a budget - so should local government.</p>
<p>When Dick Hubbard ran for Auckland&#39;s mayoralty, he told the Gay Auckland Business Association that he was concerned about the impact rates increases had on his retired mother.</p>
<p>Thousands of pensioners in the same position as Mr Hubbard&#39;s mother will find their rates bills going up again this year.</p>
<p>We need to give councils the strength, the means and, where necessary, the direction to live within their budgets.</p>
<p>I do not claim that my Bill is perfect, and I am open to suggestions for how we can improve it.</p>
<p>But I believe it is important for ratepayers and Parliament to consider the impact of rising rates.</p>
<p>Sending my Bill to Select Committee would give the public an opportunity to discuss smarter alternatives for funding local developments.</p>
<p>Instead of councillors and a handful of interest groups controlling local government, ratepayers should hold the reins.</p>
<p>My Bill may not be perfect, but it&#39;s a start. Ratepayers deserve to be listened to, and I want them to have that chance.</p>
<p>It is time to let the people decide, and to put ratepayers back in control.</p>
