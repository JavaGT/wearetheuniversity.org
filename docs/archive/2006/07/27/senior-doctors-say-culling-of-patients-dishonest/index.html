<p>Hon Tony Ryall<br>National Party Health Spokesman</p>

<p>Senior doctors say culling of patients ‘dishonest’</p>
<p>Labour’s failing leadership of the health sector has been exposed again, this time with damning criticism from senior doctors at Christchurch Hospital, says National’s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>He is commenting on reports that 10 senior doctors at Christchurch Hospital have spoken out against Canterbury DHB’s plan to slash its waiting lists by a further 5,300 patients.</p>
<p>They say waiting list culls only hide the problem of needy patients missing out on treatment, and they have labelled the system ‘dishonest’.</p>
<p>“When senior doctors at the coalface speak out against the actions taken by DHBs as a result of threats by the Labour Government to cut costs or else, something is seriously wrong,” says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>“Labour’s failure in the health sector has been exposed by specialists, doctors and patients alike.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, senior medical specialists labelled the health system ‘rotten’, and called for new approaches to the pressing issues facing the health sector.</p>
<p>“Yet Health Minister Pete Hodgson has flailed around blaming the waiting-list crisis on everyone but the Government.</p>
<p>“The senior doctors should be taking their concerns not to the DHB but to the source of the problem – Pete Hodgson and his floundering government, who are hell-bent on shutting down bad publicity rather than doing anything to improve health services.</p>
<p>“National says we could get more elective services through smart use of the private sector, greater involvement of specialists in decision-making, cuts to bureaucracy, and moving resources into services through a greater focus on value for money.”</p>
