<p>Cancer fears for patients culled from waiting list</p>
<p>The hospital waiting list cull is accelerating as DHBs hurry to meet the Labour Government&#39;s instruction to dump any patient waiting longer than six months, says National&#39;s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;More than 11,000 patients were waiting longer than six months for a specialist appointment at the end of May - over 2,200 in Auckland, and over 1,200 at each of Waitemata, Canterbury and Capital Coast.</p>
<p>&quot;These patients must be referred back to their GPs to meet Mr Hodgson&#39;s edict that no one should be on a waiting list for longer than six months.</p>
<p>&quot;They are being sent back to the very people who said they should see a specialist in the first place.</p>
<p>&quot;What the Government is doing does not make sense in any way. Many of these people will get progressively worse and their treatment will end up costing a lot more money. This is a false economy.</p>
<p>&quot;About 900 people face the chop at Palmerston North&#39;s Mid Central DHB, and GPs are warning that cancers will be missed and go untreated as a result of the waiting list cull.</p>
<p>&quot;One local GP, Ralph Saxe, has listed some of his patients who have been culled, including many with family histories of cancer who will not now get tested:</p>
<p>· A man in his 50s with blood in his urine referred for diagnosis. · Patients over 40 with a strong family history of bowel cancer for whom screening is recommended by the Health Ministry.<br>· A patient who has been to the emergency department four times with abdominal pain.<br>· A cancer patient referred by a surgeon for specialist follow-up returned to GP care without further tests.<br>· Women with severe period pain who cannot get tests to confirm or rule out endometriosis as the cause.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark promised the country more beds. But all she&#39;s given is more desks! The bureaucracy is out of control.</p>
<p>&quot;National says its time to stop the waiting list cull. Lives are at risk as specialists and GPs have all told the Government. Yet Mr Hodgson arrogantly refuses to listen.&quot;</p>
