<p><strong>Wednesday, 26 July 2006, 11:10 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>John Carter MP<br>National Party Local Government Spokesman</p>
<p>26 July 2006</p>
<p>Ratepayers carry cost of Government buck-passing</p>
<p>National Party Local Government spokesman John Carter has released a list of 67 laws passed by Labour that have had an impact, either directly or indirectly, on rates.</p>
<p>“More and more local councils are being forced to absorb the costs of Labour’s legislation. Councils have become pseudo tax collectors.</p>
<p>“Each and every year in office, Labour has passed around 10 laws that impose new costs on ratepayers.</p>
<p>“There are dozens of laws which Labour has passed without thinking about how they hurt ratepayers, especially those on fixed incomes,” says Mr Carter.</p>
<p>The list includes:<br>1 - The No. 1 culprit is the RMA which Labour has amended nine times. The fine print forces rural councils to supply top quality drinking water to all properties. In other words, farm animals may get better drinking water - but all ratepayers will have to pay for it. There are also 14 air quality standards for councils to regulate and administer under the RMA.</p>
<p>2 - Building Act 2004. Created massive costs and delays in the issuing of building consents. Many councils are struggling to attract (and retain) the numbers of staff required to process building consents and the staff they do have are being buried under a mountain of red tape - meaning additional delays and costs for ratepayers.</p>
<p>3 - Local Government Act 2002. Gave councils extra responsibilities in the areas of community and social wellbeing. These new requirements have created additional costs for all councils, and even Local Government New Zealand has said that they have not been matched by a corresponding increase in resources. An example of costs here are the audit requirements for LTCCPs, where councils have to pay auditors tens of thousands of ratepayers&#39; dollars to check that they are consulting their communities. Many of the auditors were brought in from the UK to audit NZ communities they know nothing about.</p>

<p>Mr Carter says nanny state bureaucracy is tying our councils in costly red tape.</p>
<p>“It’s time local government started detailing for ratepayers precisely how many extra costs Labour’s lumbered them with,” says Mr Carter.</p>
