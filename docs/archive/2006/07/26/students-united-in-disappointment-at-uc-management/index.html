<p>Students united in disappointment at UC Management</p>
<p>University of Canterbury students are unhappy with Vice-Chancellor Professor<br>Roy Sharp plans to bring forward fee-setting for next years domestic tuition<br>fees. The lack of consultation and notification has forced the University<br>of Canterbury Student&#39;s Association (UCSA) to step up its attempts at<br>gauging student reaction and concern. These will be voiced at a Rally being<br>held today (Wednesday) at 2pm on the University Central Library steps.</p>
<p>The last two days have seen UCSA representatives attend a number of lectures<br>in an attempt to let all UC students know what has happened. With over<br>15,000 students to inform, UCSA representatives have been working day and<br>night to not only inform students of the domestic tuition fees increase; but<br>to let students know how the Vice-Chancellor has avoided consultation with<br>students until forced to by a recent media article.</p>
<p>The Vice-Chancellor seems to have reacted to the recent newspaper article<br>by sending an all student email out, which is unprecedented. In response<br>students have been vocal and supportive of each other. This is of note in a<br>time when the University seems to have turned its back on its own students.<br>It is an example of how the University of Canterbury student body can unite<br>and stand up for a common cause, said UCSA President Warren Poh.</p>
<p>Mr Poh said, Tomorrows rally is an opportunity for students to show their<br>dissatisfaction in the process. By voicing their concerns and turning up to<br>the Rally in numbers, we will make the Vice-Chancellor hear and see that<br>students are disappointed at the actions of the University.</p>
<p>Tomorrow University of Canterbury students will show the University<br>management that we are interested in the fee-setting process. Despite the<br>University locking us out of the process this year, we will show that we<br>care, and that the University cannot push the setting of tuition fees,<br>behind our backs, Mr Poh concluded.</p>
