<p>Ten secondary school students from throughout New Zealand were today delighted to be announced in the short list of aspiring poets in the Bell Gully National Schools Poetry Award, organised by Victoria University’s Institute of Modern Letters (IIML).

<p>The shortlisted poets will be flown to Wellington in August for a poetry masterclass with IIML director Bill Manhire, Award Judge James Brown, Chris Price and Bernadette Hall.</p>
<p>This year’s competition attracted 180 entries from Year 12 and Year 13 students throughout New Zealand. The winner will be announced at an awards ceremony in Wellington on 18 August.</p>
<p>“With only two days to go until Montana Poetry Day, we’re delighted to be able to celebrate the next generation of New Zealand poets,” says Professor Manhire. The shortlisted poets are:</p>

<p>Award judge and poet James Brown believes the competition will help all those shortlisted to develop their talent.</p>
<p>“The really great thing about this competition is that it isn’t just a case of entering a poem and then finding out whether you’ve won anything or not. The day of masterclasses will give me and others a chance to discuss the poems with the poets and suggest ways to improve them.”</p>
<p>Every shortlisted poet will be awarded a 12-month subscription to Sport, New Zealand’s leading literary journal, a 12-month membership of the New Zealand Book Council, $50 Booksellers Tokens and $100 cash.</p>
