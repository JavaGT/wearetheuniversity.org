<p>Aust launches raid on our best and brightest</p>
<p>National Party Leader Don Brash says all New Zealanders should be concerned by the latest twist in Australia&#39;s raid on our best and brightest.</p>
<p>&quot;The significance of the across-the-board tax cuts announced overnight in Australia should not be overlooked,&quot; says Dr Brash.</p>
<p>&quot;For New Zealand this means more competition for the skills that we need to keep our economy growing.</p>
<p>&quot;The Labour Government doesn&#39;t have the first clue about putting the right incentives into the economy to allow people to get ahead under their own steam.</p>
<p>&quot;In contrast, a National government would have put the right incentives in place.</p>
<p>&quot;Last month was an opportunity lost in New Zealand, because on 1 April a National government would have introduced the first tranche of its extensive tax cuts package.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead, we have seen the Australian Government yet again cut taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;Substantial tax cuts are most definitely on the agenda for the next National government.</p>
<p>&quot;By then, of course, we will have lost thousands more of our best and brightest people across the Tasman. The public can thank Labour for that.&quot;</p>
