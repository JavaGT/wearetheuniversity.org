<p>NZEI Supports Increased Investment In Environmental Education</p>
<p>Education union, NZEI Te Riu Roa, fully supports an increase in Government spending on environmental education in our schools.</p>
<p>The Greens&#39; Education Spokesperson, Metiria Turei, announced today that the Government will spend $13 million dollars over four years to support environmental education in schools. The funding comes as a result of the agreement negotiated by the Greens&#39; and Labour after last year&#39;s election.</p>
<p>&quot;The environment is not a renewable resource,&quot; says Irene Cooper, the National President of NZEI Te Riu Roa.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s essential that we teach our young people about the need to protect their environment and provide them with the knowledge and skills they&#39;ll need to create a sustainable society and economy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As principal of Hillcrest Normal School in Hamilton, I&#39;ve been involved with the Enviroschools Foundation, and applaud the Government for providing it with extra funding, as I know that it runs fabulous programmes,&quot; says Irene Cooper</p>
<p>&quot;The students at Hillcrest are involved in recycling, planting gardens and trees, establishing worm farms and a host of other environmental activities.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These provide the students with practical lessons about the world around them and about sustainability, plus they&#39;re fun.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Funding environmental education represents a sound investment in our future,&quot; says Irene Cooper.</p>
