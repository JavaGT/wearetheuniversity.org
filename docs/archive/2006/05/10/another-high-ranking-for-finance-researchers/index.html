<p>Another high ranking for Massey Finance researchers</p>
<p>The University’s Finance programme has again achieved a high ranking in a respected international measure.</p>
<p>Massey is ranked 34th amongst international business schools, as measured by the number of research papers downloaded from the eLibrary of the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) during the last 12 months.</p>
<p>The ranking places Massey at the top of the list amongst New Zealand and Australian universities, with Monash in 44th place and the University of Otago in 52nd place.</p>
<p>The downloads – a measure of the quality and relevance of the research – were largely of papers by researchers from the Finance programme.</p>
<p>Finance Professor Larry Rose says the network ranking reports are relatively new and provide a useful way for institutions to see how they are stacking up.</p>
<p>He is pleased with the network ranking: &quot;It’s consistent with other international rankings achieved by our Finance researchers and shows increasing interest in our research papers. It&#39;s also a feather in the cap of the College of Business in the run up to the Asia Finance Conference in July.</p>
<p>The network is a website devoted to the promotion of scholarship in the fields of economics, finance, accounting, management and law. SSRN was founded by Michael C. Jensen, a famous financial economist, and is run by him and other highly respected scholars. The eLibrary is co-hosted by Stanford University.</p>
<p>Since its foundation in late 1994, SSRN has grown tremendously in importance in the academic community, especially in economics. Almost all papers will now first be published on it before being submitted to an academic journal.</p>

<p>Last year the University’s Finance programme was ranked 12th out of 170 universities in the Asia Pacific region for research productivity, based on research publihed in 21 of the world’s leading finance journals from 2000 to 2004. The ranking was made in a research paper distributed globally in the Pacific-Basin Finance Journal later this year.</p>
<p>Massey Finance academics are hosting the 17 Asian Finance Conference, the most significant finance conference ever to be held in New Zealand, in Auckland from 9-12 July 2006. It is organised in conjunction with the Financial Management Association, the largest finance academic and practitioner group in the United States.</p>
