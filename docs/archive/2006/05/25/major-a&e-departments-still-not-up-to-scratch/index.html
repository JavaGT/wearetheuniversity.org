<p>Major A&amp;E departments still not up to scratch</p>
<p>New Zealand&#39;s major A&amp;E departments are still failing to see emergency patients soon enough, says National&#39;s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>And National is warning that emergency patients will wait even longer if GPs carry out their threat to stop providing after-hours care.</p>
<p>The latest Hospital Benchmark Report for the December 2005 quarter shows that no major DHB in New Zealand is meeting all three of the Government&#39;s benchmarks for triage waiting times.</p>
<p>&quot;Just four DHBs met all three benchmarks for emergency triage times. They were Tairawhiti, Wairarapa, Nelson Marlborough and South Canterbury – all DHBs located in smaller cities and towns,” says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>“Only Counties Manukau, West Coast and Otago DHBs met both the benchmarks for triage codes 1 and 2 – patients with immediate or imminent ‘life or limb threat’.</p>
<p>“DHBs are still failing to meet the target times. The huge amount of extra money being poured into the health system obviously isn&#39;t getting to where it’s needed.</p>
<p>&quot;Health Minister Pete Hodgson could fix delays in emergency care by fixing after-hours GP care. The demand for after-hours services is not being met, and the high cost has put the service out of the reach of too many people.</p>
<p>“GPs are threatening to withdraw from after-hours care in the South Island, and this would put even greater pressure on A&amp;E departments. The same rumblings are coming from GPs elsewhere.</p>
<p>&quot;But, instead of doing something about it, the Government is changing the way it measures emergency department wait times. It plans to count contact with an experienced nurse as contact with a doctor.</p>
<p>“Too much energy, money and time is being spent on Labour covering its tracks, and not enough is finding its way to the frontline,” says Mr Ryall.</p>
