<p>Budget Crumbs For Auckland Roads</p>
<p>Rodney Hide<br>Wednesday, 24 May 2006<br>Press Releases - Transport</p>
<p>The &#39;Minister For Auckland&#39; has been questioned in Parliament by Rodney Hide, MP for Epsom and the Leader of ACT, who says that Auckland missed out from the Budget&#39;s boost to transport funding.</p>
<p>&quot;Last week&#39;s Budget provided an extra $1.3 billion for transport, but crumbs for Auckland&#39;s motorists&quot;, Mr Hide said.</p>
<p>&quot;The only benefit for Aucklanders is that the Mangere Bridge will be &#39;substantially completed&#39; by the end of 2011 rather than 2012.</p>
<p>&quot;How many cars can use a &#39;substantially completed&#39; bridge on an unfinished motorway?</p>
<p>&quot;The benefits of the bridge will only be realised when the full motorway, including the Avondale Extension, is completed - and that is still a long way off.</p>
<p>&quot;Traffic congestion in Auckland costs around $750 million a year. The financial and environmental costs of going nowhere are rising.</p>
<p>&quot;Every year of delay is costing massive returns and growth - worth around $830 million a year in the western corridor alone.</p>
<p>&quot;Judith Tizard is voting for a Budget that sold Aucklanders short.</p>
<p>&quot;In just five years, Auckland will host a Rugby World Cup final. Thousands of extra visitors will need to travel around the city and get to the game on time.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not good enough to hold them up at the boundary of Helen Clark&#39;s electorate, where the Western Ring Route has stalled.</p>
<p>&quot;Government needs to start taking action on roading as if it were a national emergency - which it is now becoming.</p>
<p>&quot;In Parliament, Judith Tizard could not identify a single Auckland Issue that she has resolved in seven years as Minister. She should be fired&quot;, Mr Hide said.</p>
