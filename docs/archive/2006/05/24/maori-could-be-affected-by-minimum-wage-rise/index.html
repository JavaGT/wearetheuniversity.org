<p>Maori would be most adversely affected by a rise in the minimum wage, says an AUT senior economics lecturer.</p>
<p>Gail Pacheco studied rates of employment and inactivity among people who find the minimum wage binding in her thesis: Minimum wages in New Zealand: An empirical inquiry.</p>
<p>&quot;There are high numbers of Maori and Pacific Island people on minimum wage,&quot; she says. &quot;Together they account for more than a fifth of minimum and sub-minimum wage workers, therefore they&#39;ll attract more negative impact if the wage rise drives employers to reassess their options.&quot;</p>
<p>Pacheco says a rise in minimum wage means unskilled and young workers, especially between ages 16-19, could be displaced.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the option employers might switch to hiring people with more skills and education or older people with more experience.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My study found for Maori who find the minimum wage binding, a 10% rise in the real minimum wage would see a 15.8% point fall in employment propensity, a drop of 13.5 hours usually worked each week, a 5.7% point increase in unemployment propensity and a 10.9% point increase in inactivity, that is, not working or studying.&quot;</p>
<p>Pacheco says the minimum wage is a blunt instrument and there needs to be a more balanced debate around increasing it.</p>
<p>&quot;I want policy makers to debate and consider the negative affects of a rise in minimum wage. There needs to be some reasoning to show the positive affects outweigh the negative affects.&quot;</p>
