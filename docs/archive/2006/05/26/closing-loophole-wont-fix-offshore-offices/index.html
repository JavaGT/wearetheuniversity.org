<p>Hon Dr Lockwood Smith<br>National Party Immigration Spokesman</p>
<p>26 May 2006</p>
<p>Closing loophole won’t fix offshore offices</p>
<p>Immigration Minister David Cunliffe&#39;s claim this week that the Government is closing a loophole in guardian visas does not stand up to scrutiny because questions about its offshore immigration offices remain unanswered, says National’s Immigration spokesman, Dr Lockwood Smith.</p>
<p>The Government says it has moved to close a loophole in the Immigration Act which allowed guardians of foreign fee-paying students to gain work permits, in turn saving tens of thousands of dollars in student fees.</p>
<p>But Dr Smith says the case of a Korean man who was twice refused a work permit in New Zealand, only to be granted one in South Korea, shows the problem could be worse than the Government has acknowledged.</p>
<p>&quot;A guardian visa doesn’t automatically entitle someone to a work permit. Clearly, someone in an offshore office has been making decisions to grant work permits to people who do not meet Immigration New Zealand’s own conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;This evidence of suspect decision-making has emerged only because schools must see appropriate documentation to support any change in status from foreign fee-paying student to domestic student.</p>
<p>”Other residence and work permit approvals would not normally be scrutinised in this way.</p>
<p>”This means the guardian problem could be just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to know what the Minister is doing to put in place quality control measures to assure the integrity of Immigration New Zealand decisions around the world,&quot; says Dr Smith.</p>
