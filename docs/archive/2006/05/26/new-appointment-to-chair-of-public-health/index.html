<p>New Appointment To Chair Of Public Health</p>
<p>An expert in the evaluation of screening programmes and cancer epidemiology, Professor Ann Richardson, has been appointed to the Chair in Public Health at the Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Otago.</p>
<p>Professor Richardson graduated with degrees in Medicine (MB, ChB) from the University of Otago in 1983, became a Fellow of the Australasian Faculty of Public Health Medicine in 1990, and gained a PhD in public health in 1997. Professor Richardson has been a member of the Department of Public Health and General Practice at the School from 1995. Previously she was a clinical research fellow in the Cancer Epidemiology Unit at the University of Oxford.</p>
<p>The Vice-Chancellor of Otago University, Professor David Skegg, whose background is also in public health, says Professor Richardson is a superb teacher and health researcher.</p>
<p>“I have worked with Ann Richardson in the past, and know that she is strongly committed to scientific work that will advance the health of New Zealanders,” says Professor Skegg.</p>
<p>Other than her interests in cancer epidemiology and the evaluation of screening programmes, Professor Richardson is involved in curriculum planning and review, and in 2004 received a Vice-Chancellor’s Award for excellence in teaching.</p>
<p>She has also served on many working parties and advisory groups, and is on the steering group for Healthy Christchurch, an inter-sectoral collaboration to improve the health of Christchurch people.</p>
<p>Acting Dean, Professor Peter Joyce, says that Professor Richardson has already made, and will continue to make, an outstanding contribution to the Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Sciences through her teaching, research and service.</p>
