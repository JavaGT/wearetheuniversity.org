<p>Hysteria over &#39;migrant scam&#39; risks harming New Zealand</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s use of what it concedes is &#39;anecdotal&#39; evidence to change the work rules for guardians of overseas students is foolishly short-sighted, Green Party Education Spokesperson Metiria Turei says.</p>
<p>&quot;Immigration Minister David Cunliffe is letting himself be pushed around by his departmental bureaucrats.</p>
<p>&quot;It is another example of an immigration policy driven more by a reactionary scramble to keep alleged undesirables out, than by a balanced vision of how we should be attracting in the sort of people we need.</p>
<p>&quot;In the case of guardians applying for work permits, there is no firm evidence that this is a widespread problem. Reportedly, some 7000 people have applied for work permits since the scheme was introduced several years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has provided no independent research into whether this level was unduly high or widely driven by fraudulent intent, before the decision to change the rules was taken.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole episode smacks of the anti-Asian sentiment fostered by some elements of the current Government during last year&#39;s election campaign. I doubt whether such &#39;anecdotal&#39; evidence would be being acted upon if the guardians concerned came from England.</p>
<p>&quot;The reality is that this scheme was introduced in the wake of several notorious examples of abuse of overseas students. Changing the work rules in a way that will make it all but impossible for guardians to make a living here is a knee-jerk response that can only harm New Zealand&#39;s ability to present itself as a society that welcomes overseas students, and cares about keeping them safe,&quot; Mrs Turei says.</p>
<p>&quot;Those few who may have been deliberately abusing the system should be prosecuted, without changing the rules for everyone else, who are meeting a genuine need.</p>
<p>&quot;To save a few bucks in the short term, New Zealand risks harming its reputation among the very people that we need to attract, for our future economic well-being.&quot;</p>
