<p>New national research centre to study work</p>
<p>Gainful employment is central to most people’s lives. A new AUT University-based research centre will investigate exactly what our working culture means for New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Centre for Work and Labour Market Studies (CWaLMS) will lead New Zealand research into analysing the patterns of work during an individual’s lifetime.</p>
<p>This Friday, May 26, Speaker of the House Margaret Wilson will join academics and business leaders to launch the new national centre.</p>
<p>CWaLMS Director Professor of Employment Relations Ray Markey, from the Faculty of Business, believes the centre’s uniquely holistic approach will make it a major global research institute.</p>
<p>Work – paid or unpaid – enables profit and competitive advantage for enterprises and social and economic governance of communities, he says.</p>
<p>“CWaLMS research will focus on the whole picture. It will look at links between parts of a person’s life – from birth to education, training to employment, leaving the workplace for child-rearing and returning, to further education and retirement.<br>“Public policy and individual decisions concerning each of these stages of a person’s life affects each of the other parts. CWaLMS brings to these issues a multidisciplinary team of AUT researchers with backgrounds in law, economics, employment relations, human resource management, social policy, sociology and labour history,” he says.</p>
<p>Professor Markey is joint editor of the International Employment Relations Review and chair of the International Industrial Relations Association Study Group on Workers&#39; Participation. He is interested in regional and comparative employment relations, employee participation and labour history.</p>
<p>He has been a consultant to the Australian Department of Industrial Relations, the ILO (International Labour Organization) and a number of firms and trade unions in Australia, Britain and the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Professor Markey is the author of six books on industrial relations and labour history, and has edited seven others. He has published more than 80 articles.</p>
