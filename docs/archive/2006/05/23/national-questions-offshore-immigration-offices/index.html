<p>National questions offshore immigration offices</p>
<p>National’s Immigration spokesman, Lockwood Smith, says the problem of guardians of international students scamming the visa system may be worse than the Government has acknowledged.</p>
<p>The Government has moved to close a loophole in the Immigration Act which allowed guardians of foreign fee-paying students to gain work permits, in turn saving tens of thousands of dollars in student fees.</p>
<p>Dr Smith says he understands that, in some instances, offshore immigration officers have issued work permits to guardians who had been previously rejected by New Zealand-based immigration staff.</p>
<p>“This raises serious questions about our offshore immigration offices. If an application is declined in New Zealand how can it then be accepted in another country?</p>
<p>“It must also be asked if this kind of practice is taking place with regard to other categories of migrants. If someone is denied a residency permit, for example, in New Zealand, do they have the option of obtaining one through a New Zealand immigration office elsewhere?</p>
<p>“Labour created a loophole wide enough to drive a bus through that allowed international students to scam our schools out of tens of thousands of dollars. I am pleased they have closed that but they must now turn their attention to the wider issue of the integrity of offshore offices,” says Dr Smith.</p>
