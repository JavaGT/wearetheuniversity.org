<p>Noisy quilts wanted</p>
<p>When is a quilt not a quilt? When it is noisy says Associate Professor Joyce Stalker from the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>“Although we often think of quilts in terms of comfort and warmth, in reality they have many roles. Often they are used to celebrate, commemorate or heal. However, what we want to see are noisy quilts—ones that speak out against family violence and violence against women.”</p>
<p>This project is a joint initiative of the Human Rights Commission (HRC) and the School of Education, University of Waikato. It was created in response to statistics, which reveal that family violence and violence against women thrive in Aotearoa New Zealand. Together, they cost millions of dollars and create fear, intimidation, emotional and financial deprivation.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be a quilter to create these ‘quilts.’ Unlike many traditional quilts, the size, dimensions, techniques and materials are only judged in terms of their ability to enhance the impact of the statement, and extend the notion of ‘quilt.’</p>
<p>This international challenge is part of The New Zealand Quilt Symposium January 19-24, 2007, Manawatu, Aotearoa New Zealand. Two quilts will be selected for awards of $500 each.</p>
<p>Entry deadline for CDs/Photos is 1 November 2006</p>
