<p>Transforming education by focusing on the learner will be the key theme of upcoming educational conference to be held in Hamilton and in Christchurch in June.</p>

<p>The workshops are designed to support primary and secondary schools in personalising learning and will consist of four key themes: deep learning, deep experience, deep support and deep leadership. Participants are encouraged to bring their senior leadership teams and participate in diagnostic activities and planning exercises based on their school context.</p>
<p>International Networking for Educational Transformation (iNet) New Zealand will also be launched at the event. iNet originates from the United Kingdom and is a leading-edge school-based international collaboration whereby members can share innovation, knowledge and best practice with other schools around the world.</p>

Associate Professor Jan Robertson from the Educational Leadership Centre at the University of Waikato will also speak. Jan is an expert in Leadership Coaching.
