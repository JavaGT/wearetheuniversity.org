<p>Two sets of ‘official’ NCEA results in circulation</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English says there are two different sets of 2005 NCEA results in circulation.</p>
<p>“The aggregate statistics publicly available on the NZQA website paint a brighter picture of last year’s NCEA than those circulated to the school sector around the time of the official publication of results.”</p>
<p>The NZQA website shows that 43.3% of students sitting English standard 90055 in 2005 did not achieve it, but the statistics provided to schools for analysis show that 34.5% did not achieve.</p>
<p>Mr English says he wants to know how and why the differences in these sets of results have occurred.</p>
<p>“Is it by accident or design?</p>
<p>“When did NZQA decide to release the second set of statistics? Did they deliberately publicly release numbers that painted the NCEA in a better light?</p>
<p>“The variability of NCEA results – both between subjects and between year groups - was the single biggest issue facing the education sector in 2005.</p>
<p>“The fact that there are two sets of results in circulation leaves open the question of whether or not NZQA made changes to improve the look of the results and make it look like that problem has gone away.</p>
<p>“Steve Maharey assured students, parents and teachers that NCEA 2005 went off without a hitch. He must now explain why there are two different sets of results in circulation,” says Mr English.</p>
