<p>Biennale report misses the point</p>
<p>National Party MP Katherine Rich says an $80,000 report out today on New Zealand&#39;s participation in the Venice Biennale totally misses the point.</p>
<p>&quot;The controversy was about the selection of an anonymous artist, who refused to appear publicly to promote the work, or promote New Zealand, and whose artwork did not reflect a Kiwi flavour.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Rich says the report appears to have canvassed only the views of a selected few interested parties, including Creative New Zealand staff.</p>
<p>&quot;What we&#39;ve ended up with is a group of academics who have unanimously reached the conclusion that New Zealanders simply didn&#39;t understand the &#39;et al.&#39; work and merely needed to be educated about it.</p>
<p>&quot;But surely the question which wasn&#39;t asked is, should we be sending art work that promotes New Zealand, promotes New Zealand art and has a distinctively Kiwi feel about it?</p>
<p>&quot;I think most Kiwis question whether &#39;Fundamental Practice&#39; said anything about New Zealand, or New Zealand art.</p>
<p>&quot;Australia has previously used the Biennale as a showcase for Aborigine art and a venue to advance Australian arts and culture.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Rich, who is National&#39;s spokeswoman for Trade and Enterprise, says the suggestion of additional funding from Trade and Enterprise for the next Biennale will inevitably need to be subjected to thorough scrutiny.</p>
<p>&quot;The prospect of further taxpayer funding for this event will cause some irritation for those who don&#39;t think &#39;et al.&#39; was the right choice last time. Getting the selection criteria right is also key to securing corporate backing.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an opportunity to showcase New Zealand art and a New Zealand artist in front of the global arts community. The fact that &#39;et al.&#39; wouldn&#39;t front, and that her work didn&#39;t really say anything about New Zealand, is an issue that Creative New Zealand needs to deal with.</p>
<p>&quot;This report doesn&#39;t address that substantive issue at all,&quot; says Mrs Rich.</p>
