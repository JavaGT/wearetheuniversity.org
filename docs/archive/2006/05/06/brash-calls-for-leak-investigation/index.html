<p><strong>Saturday, 6 May 2006, 6:19 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Don Brash MP<br>National Party Leader<br>06 May 2006</p>
<p>Brash calls for select committee to investigate leak</p>
<p>National Party Leader Don Brash is calling for a select committee inquiry into the leak of confidential Budget documents.</p>
<p>“On Wednesday we saw the most serious, most damaging, most confidence-destroying leak of commercially confidential material from the Cabinet room in the history of this country.”</p>
<p>Dr Brash made the comments in a speech to the Party’s Canterbury/Westland Regional Conference in Picton today.</p>
<p>“A billion-dollar leak of Budget confidential information that could only have come from one of Helen Clark’s inner circle.</p>
<p>“The Government’s bumbling has needlessly worsened the situation for investors, and shows the Government’s complete lack of understanding about how the economy and the capital markets work.</p>
<p>“And Helen Clark can hardly complain, because it’s she who’s set the ground rules; it’s she who’s set the appallingly low standards for this administration.”</p>
<p>Before his speech Dr Brash said National would write to the Commerce Select Committee about the need for an inquiry.</p>
<p>“Parliament and the public must have an opportunity to assess for themselves what went on, who was responsible and the role of Ministers in briefing officials handling sensitive documents.</p>
<p>“Parliament trusts the executive to conduct business in a seemly manner. A leak like this is an insult to the political process,” he said.</p>
<p>“Even when the source of the leak is identified, there will still be a number of questions that both sides of the House will have an interest in making sure are answered,” said Dr Brash.</p>
