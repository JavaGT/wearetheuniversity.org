<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>22 May 2006</p>
<p>Victoria continues on growth path</p>
<p>Victoria University continues to grow, with New Zealand’s Capital City University shrugging off a flattening of enrolments in 2005 to record a $9 million consolidated surplus, its latest Annual Report shows.</p>
<p>The Report shows Victoria enrolled 20,380 students in 2005, making it an institution of more than 20,000 students for the first time. The number of equivalent full-time students (EFTS) increased by 8.6 percent to 16,436. However, when compared with the combined results of the University and the Wellington College of Education in 2004, the number of EFTS slightly decreased from 16,442 to 16,436.</p>
<p>Despite this flattening of enrolment growth, the University still achieved a consolidated surplus, before one-off items, of $9 million, leaving a surplus of $8.1 million for core University operations which will be invested in improved facilities and services for students and staff. The total surplus was $41 million, due to incorporating the assets of the College in the University’s accounts.</p>
<p>Enrolments in 2006 have since rebounded with demand from New Zealand students more than compensating for an anticipated drop in the number of international enrolments from China.</p>
<p>Professor Walsh said 2005 saw the University achieve several major milestones.</p>
<p>“Several academic staff received national and international honours for their teaching and research while the University was, for the first time, recognised as one of the world’s top 500 universities—and one of the top 100 in the Asia-Pacific region—by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s Institute of Higher Education.</p>

<p>“Following the successful merger with the Wellington College of Education, an alumni dinner, to mark 125 Years of Developing Great Teachers in Wellington, was held in October to recognise the College’s achievements and the importance of teacher education in the expanded University. This marks the beginning of an annual reunion dinner for all Victoria alumni in the Wellington Town Hall each October.”</p>
<p>Professor Walsh said in the first Performance-Based Research Fund exercise, Victoria University was named as one of New Zealand’s top three research-led universities.</p>
<p>“With the next evaluation due in July this year, we’re not resting on our laurels. During 2005 the University initiated a robust process to ensure the evidence portfolios submitted this year are of the highest calibre and best represent the quality of its research.</p>
<p>“External research income also grew significantly in 2005, increasing 22.7 percent to $22.6 million. The University is making good progress toward achieving its new strategic goal of $40 million in external research income by 2012.”</p>
<p>Professor Walsh said the New Zealand Academic Audit Unit undertook its third audit of the University, releasing its report in late August.</p>
<p>“The panel commended the University for its work in strengthening and enhancing programmes, infrastructure and finances since it was last audited in 2000. The report also provided many useful suggestions for enhancements to the University’s teaching, learning and decision-making processes.”</p>
