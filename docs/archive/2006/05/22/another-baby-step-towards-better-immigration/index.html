<p>Another Baby Step Towards Better Immigration</p>
<p>New Zealand First associate immigration spokesperson Peter Brown has commended the Government&#39;s move to close a loophole to prevent foreign student guardians cheating the visa system, but says there is much more to be done.</p>
<p>&quot;Having an immigration system that is open to fraud or any other abuse poses huge threats to New Zealand. Placing restrictions on the type of work permits granted to people who come to New Zealand as guardians of foreign students, as well as the Budget&#39;s increased funding for border security, are long overdue but welcome initiatives.</p>
<p>&quot;As part of New Zealand First’s confidence and supply agreement with the Government, we are working to ensure that a wide-ranging review of the Immigration Act and the Department&#39;s administrative practices fix many of the fundamental failings of the system.</p>
<p>&quot;In the face of huge immigration pressures, we need to initiate and encourage concrete action which will process concrete change in the best interests of all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand First looks forward to working with the Government to make sure that our other concerns are addressed also,&quot; concluded Mr Brown.</p>
