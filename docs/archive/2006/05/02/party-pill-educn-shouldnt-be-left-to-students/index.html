<p>Jacqui Dean<br>National Party MP</p>
<p>2 May 2006</p>
<p>Party pill education shouldn’t be left to students</p>
<p>Students should not be put in the position of acting as the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff when it comes to party pills, says National MP Jacqui Dean.</p>
<p>She is commenting on a project at Nelson College for Girls to create a pocket-sized card explaining the possible side effects of party pills.</p>
<p>“The fact that children 18 and younger are concerned about the dangers of party pills should be ringing alarm bells with Associate Minister of Health Jim Anderton,”says Mrs Dean.</p>
<p>“I support any education campaign about the dangers of party pills, but it shouldn’t get to the stage where school kids have to do it.</p>
<p>“There is a growing body of evidence - both anecdotal and science-based - that pills containing BZP and sold as party pills are causing serious side effects in people who take them, particularly when taken with alcohol.</p>
<p>“These party pills are bullets to the brain, and teenagers should not have to be doing the job of educating people.</p>
<p>“Young people are harming themselves. This dangerous drug culture must be shut down.”</p>
<p>Mrs Dean’s 7,500-strong petition calling for further research and much tighter controls on the advertising and sale of party pills is with Parliament’s health select committee.</p>
