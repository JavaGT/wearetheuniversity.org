<p>WELLINGTON – The top women graduates of Massey’s College of Creative Arts were honoured at the Zonta Design Awards last night.</p>
<p>Governor-General Dame Silvia Cartwright announced graphic designer Sarah Jackson as the supreme winner. Ms Jackson received $5000 while the winners in four other design fields received $1000.</p>
<p>Sarah Peters of the Zonta International Club of Wellington says Zonta, a women’s service organization, established the awards in partnership with the University and five leading businesses to recognise the top women graduates in their field of design, to promote design as a career for young women, and to acknowledge the status of women already in the design field.</p>
<p>Ms Jackson, who is now working for Clemenger Design, said afterwards, “I’m still on cloud 10. As a woman in the advertising industry, I have an intense desire to be a relevant part of an ever-evolving creative world that demands originality, substance and reward in order to make a meaningful impact.</p>
<p>“And, as a woman, my essence is to push the known boundaries of communication whilst maintaining respect for myself.”</p>

<p>The University’s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Judith Kinnear, said the college produced graduates who made “outstanding” contributions to the New Zealand and international design industries.</p>
<p>“They do this as entrepreneurs in their own businesses, such as Kate Sylvester on Cuba Street and Veronica Keucke, an awardee at the recent Mercedes Australian Fashion Week, and as employees in a range of enterprises, such as Weta, Fisher &amp; Paykel, Apple Computers, Nike and Philips,” Professor Kinnear said.</p>
<p>The five design category winners for this year are:<br>Emma Boyd, Industrial Design, sponsored by Weta Workshop<br>Sally Ford, Photographic Design, sponsored by Imagelab<br>Briar Hickling, Interior Design, sponsored by Limited Editions<br>Sarah Jackson, Graphic Design, sponsored by Clemenger Design<br>Emily Miller-Sharma, Fashion and Textile Design, sponsored by Rembrandt Suits</p>
