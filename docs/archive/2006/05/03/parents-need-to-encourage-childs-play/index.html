<p>Media release Wednesday 3 May 2006</p>
<p>Parents need to encourage child&#39;s play, says AUT study</p>
<p>New research shows a positive link between children&#39;s overall activity levels and their physical activity behaviour outside of the school environment.</p>
<p>AUT University PhD scholar Michele Cox carried out the study comparing primary school-aged children&#39;s in and out of school activity and discovered both girls and boys completed more steps after school.</p>
<p>The study recently appeared in the Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport.</p>
<p>Overall 52.4% of steps were taken outside of school and 47.6% in school. This was more pronounced among the most active children who completed 55.1% of their steps outside school, compared to 46.7% in the least active group.</p>
<p>&quot;This makes sense given there is a ceiling on the amount of physical activity a child can do within a school&#39;s structured physical education classes, organised sport and breaks,&quot; says Ms Cox.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents need to recognise this and take responsibility for getting their children moving and not load it onto schools and say &#39;you do it&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>The findings are based on 91 children aged between 5 and 11 years old from an Auckland decile 7 primary school. The children wore pedometers for three consecutive days and measurements were taken at the end of the school day and first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>The study also confirmed boys are more active than girls with a mean step difference of 2,575 steps, and while the average for both was within the recommended guidelines, the extremely high levels of some masked a large group of sedentary children.</p>
<p>&quot;The activity levels of some children, as low as 7,000 steps per day, are a real concern. So it&#39;s important that physical activity is continued to be promoted to all children, even the seemingly active ones,&quot; says Ms Cox.</p>
<p>The study also found the older the child, the more steps they do.</p>
<p>&quot;This could be because younger children are more supervised in their play or pedometers may underestimate their steps because of the children&#39;s slower total speed and the intermittent nature of their play.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Cox hopes to go onto study who parents, schools and children think are responsible for encouraging their physical activity.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect schools and parents might blame each other, but if nothing changes, obviously our children&#39;s activity rates won&#39;t improve.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Cox is also Head of Women&#39;s Football for New Zealand Soccer and is a member of the FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) Committee for Women&#39;s Football and the FIFA Women&#39;s World Cup.</p>
