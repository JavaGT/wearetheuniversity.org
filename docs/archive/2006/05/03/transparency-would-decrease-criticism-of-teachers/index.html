<p>Hon Bill English National Party Education Spokesman</p>

<p>More transparency would decrease criticism of teachers</p>
<p>Criticism of teachers would be greatly reduced if parents had easier access to information about what goes on in the classroom, says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>He is commenting on the release of a Ministry of Education-commissioned report that says teachers feel they are fighting an &#39;accumulating lack of respect&#39; from students, parents and the public.</p>
<p>Mr English says the community will continue to be critical of teachers and schools when they are left in the dark about children&#39;s progress and a school&#39;s performance, relative to similar schools.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is sitting on a huge amount of information on schools and students but its policy is to keep it from parents and the community</p>
<p>&quot;Teachers have complained about a lack of respect for years. The only way to put a stop to it is to open the black box of education and let parents see so they can replace the criticism with a genuine interest in the complex and usually successful work of teachers,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
