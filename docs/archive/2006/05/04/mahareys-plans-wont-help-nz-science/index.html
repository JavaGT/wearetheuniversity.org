<p>Dr Paul Hutchison National Party Research, Science &amp; Technology Spokesman</p>
<p>4 May 2006</p>
<p>Maharey&#39;s plans won&#39;t help NZ science</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s plans to decrease contestability in science funding will make New Zealand less competitive with the rest of the world, says National&#39;s Research, Science and Technology spokesman, Dr Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey has introduced highly competitive funding into universities,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;Why is he now planning to do the opposite for Crown Research Institutes?</p>
<p>&quot;Both Mr Maharey and his colleague Trevor Mallard have said that contestable funding moves the emphasis to quality over quantity. It appears they have not taken their own advice.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister has provided no hard evidence that his proposed changes will work, and most scientific and economic literature strongly supports contestable funding.</p>
<p>&quot;Government investment in science, expressed as a percentage of GDP, has gone down in the past six years, and now the Minister is moving to reduce our competitiveness as well,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
