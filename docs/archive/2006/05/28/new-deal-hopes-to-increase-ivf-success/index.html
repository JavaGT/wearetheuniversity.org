<p>New deal hopes to increase IVF success</p>
<p>Couples having fertility treatment may in the near future benefit from a technology developed by biotechnology company KODE Biotech Limited, an AUT University partner institution.</p>
<p>KODE Biotech signed an agreement this week with Olso Stock Exchange-listed Danish company MediCult a/s giving them exclusive global rights to KODE Biotech&#39;s Assisted Reproduction Technologies (ART) applications.</p>
<p>KODE Biotech works in collaboration with the AUT&#39;s Biotechnology Research Institute. It has an active research team of 14 people and has developed a substantial intellectual property portfolio based on KODE technology.</p>
<p>This novel technology harmlessly attaches molecules onto cells, ranging from red blood cells to embryos. It has multiple applications in medical therapeutics and diagnostics.</p>
<p>KODE Biotech&#39;s Chief Executive Officer Peter Bradley says the partnership between them and Medicult a/s ensures further development and ultimately its conversion into products for ART applications hopefully within four-five years.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking forward to working with MediCult and developing products that will bring meaningful benefits to ART customers,&quot; says Mr Bradley.</p>
<p>Although several new techniques in recent years have been implemented to increase pregnancy rates through IVF, the chance for a couple to take home a baby after one IVF treatment is still on average only 25%.</p>
<p>&quot;If our early research can be shown to produce favourable outcomes in human clinical trials, this technology will further improve pregnancy and baby-take-home rates and will be applicable within standard IVF and IVM therapies,&quot; says Mr Bradley.</p>
<p>KODE Biotech&#39;s work was supported by a Technology for Business Growth grant from TechNZ and a Growth Services Fund grant from NZTE.</p>
<p>AUT offers KODE Biotech infrastructural support while the university&#39;s PhD students have the opportunity to apply their academic skills in a commercial environment.</p>
