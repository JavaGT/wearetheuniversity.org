<p>Judith Collins MP National Party Welfare Spokeswoman</p>
<p>11 May 2006</p>
<p>Concern over turning tide on unemployment</p>
<p>National Party Welfare spokeswoman Judith Collins says the latest figures showing a rise in unemployment should send a &quot;cold shudder&quot; through the tired Labour Government.</p>
<p>&quot;Meaningful welfare reform is always easier when the economic conditions are good. Labour has squandered that opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Collins is commenting on figures that show the unemployment rate rose from 3.6 to 3.9 percent in the March quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the likelihood of growing joblessness, welfare reform should have already taken place.</p>
<p>&quot;A single core benefit, which Budget leaks are suggesting will be among the measures flagged next week, doesn&#39;t constitute meaningful welfare reform and is more about hiding the figures.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has shuffled the deck chairs and allowed thousands upon thousands of Kiwis to slip onto sickness and invalids benefits.</p>
<p>&quot;And welfare reform will become even more critical if skilled Kiwis start taking up the carrot that Australia is offering in the form of wide ranging tax cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has had no will to reform welfare. They have made some tinkering changes and the forecasts show unemployment is set to rise.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has coasted along on the good climate provided by economic conditions that have absolutely nothing to do with their policies. It&#39;s time to take welfare reform seriously,&quot; says Ms Collins.</p>
