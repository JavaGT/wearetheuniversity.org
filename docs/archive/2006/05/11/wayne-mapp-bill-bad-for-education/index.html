<p>Media Release<br>May 11, 2006<br>From NZEI Te Riu Roa<br>For Immediate Use</p>
<p>Wayne Mapp Bill Bad for Education</p>
<p>The country&#39;s largest education union, NZEI Te Riu Roa, opposes the members bill by National MP Wayne Mapp that will mean anyone who starts a new job can be sacked during their first three months and have no ability to challenge their dismissal.</p>
<p>Dr Mapp&#39;s bill is being considered by Parliament&#39;s transport and industrial relations select committee. NZEI, which has 45,000, members including 28,000 primary teachers and principals, 10,000 school support staff, and a thousand special education staff, is lodging a submission saying the bill should not be passed into law.</p>
<p>&quot;NZEI members oppose the Wayne Mapp Bill because it will have a negative impact on the education of the 750,000 children attending New Zealand&#39;s schools,&quot; says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Irene Cooper.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s because it will discourage teachers, principals and support staff from moving to different schools, particularly those that find it hard to attract staff.&quot;</p>
<p>Teaching is a mobile profession with teachers working at different schools as they grow in experience and seek to progress their career. It&#39;s common for a teacher&#39;s career to begin in a rural community or a low decile urban school that struggles to attract staff. They often move away from these schools as they gain experience then return later in their careers to take a job as a senior teacher, deputy principal or principal.</p>

<p>&quot;This mobility is good for education as it helps schools throughout the country, in all types of communities, staff their classrooms,&quot; says Irene Cooper. &quot;It&#39;s good for the students as new teachers and principals help ensure schools are exciting places for them to be, as they bring a fresh energy and new ideas.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wayne Mapp&#39;s bill will threaten this by discouraging teachers and principals from moving so freely from school to school.&quot;</p>
<p>Teachers and principals will be reluctant to sell their house and move their family to a community in another part of the country, if there&#39;s a risk their new job will be terminated during the first three months and they&#39;ll be stranded in a new area with no income.</p>
<p>&quot;We can&#39;t afford to make it difficult for teachers and principals to change schools to advance their career,&quot; says Irene Cooper. &quot;That&#39;s why it&#39;s vital for the education of our children that this bill does not become law.&quot;</p>
