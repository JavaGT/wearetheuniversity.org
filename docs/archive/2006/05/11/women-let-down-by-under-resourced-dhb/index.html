<p>Women let down by under-resourced DHB</p>
<p>Revelations that a 39-year-old Waikato woman with a breast lump was told she could not see a specialist for nine months is more evidence that there is a growing health workforce crisis, say National MPs Tony Ryall and Jackie Blue.</p>
<p>&quot;Waikato breast surgeon Dr Ian Campbell said the DHB was funded to see only 1,000 new breast cancer referrals and that was well off meeting the demand,”says Dr Blue.</p>
<p>&quot;This woman was fortunate that she had the means to be seen privately.</p>
<p>&quot;What do other women do?”</p>
<p>Mr Ryall says there are major pressure points in the health sector but workforce issues are top of the list.</p>
<p>“Without the trained workforce, there won’t be a public health service.</p>
<p>“This is a problem that won’t go away, and this woman’s experience should ring alarm bells with the Minister.&quot;</p>
