<h3>Newsworthy 5 May 2006</h3>
<p><em><strong>No. 71 Organised crime and the gangs</strong></em></p>
<p>I recently gave a speech on organised crimes and the gangs in the context of growing concern about the proliferation of hard drugs. The link to the speech is: <a href="http://www.richardworth.co.nz/2006/Speech%20-%20Northern%20AGM.htm">http://www.richardworth.co.nz/2006/Speech%20-%20Northern%20AGM.htm</a></p>
<p>The key points include:</p>
<p>* With nearly 6,000 patched members and an estimated 60,000 associates or &quot;hang-arounds&quot; ethnic, outlaw motorcycle and youth gangs in New Zealand out-number sworn police officers by nearly 9 to 1.</p>
<p>* A number of the gangs are actively involved in the peddling of drugs and the use of the proceeds of crime to establish businesses in the community.</p>
<p>* The Government&#39;s proposals in respect of new proceeds of crime legislation are flawed because there are better statutory models on which to base an asset forfeiture regime. Immigration - one nation many peoples shared values</p>
<p>There is a perception in the community that we are being over-run by immigrants who are destroying the New Zealand way of life. The perception is reinforced by adverse media comment and stereo typing of migrants.</p>
<p>Some of us overlook that immigrants fill critical shortages in our skilled workforce - about 41% of all practising doctors in New Zealand were trained overseas.</p>
<p>Immigrants improve our national demographic profile. They offset our declining birth-rate and the large and growing outflow of New Zealanders heading overseas. Only one in ten immigrants is aged over 55.</p>

<p>Immigrants also bring experiences and diversity that benefit the wider community -immigrants from the Balkans were instrumental in setting up the New Zealand wine industry; immigrants from Asia have added rich diversity to our food industry.</p>
<p>Facts about immigration</p>
<p>* One in six New Zealanders (700,000) was born overseas.</p>
<p>* In 2005 -79,000 permanent immigrants arrived in New Zealand and 72,000 New Zealanders left to live abroad.</p>
<p>* 81% of 804 employers surveyed in February 2006 rated the job performance of migrant employees as good or very good. * In 2004 there were: - 167 arrests for every 10,000 Asians in New Zealand - 320 arrests for every 10,000 Europeans, and - 1,448 arrests for every 10,000 Maori. The abuse of power by the party in power Don Brash said on 30 April 2006 in an Auckland speech: ...in the seven months since the election, politics has, to a degree, been a phoney war. Voters had a period of being weary of politics, and that is understandable, given the long election campaign, the close result, and then the time it took before a government was formed.</p>
<p>The Labour Party has also been embroiled in a huge amount of political scandal over that period. We&#39;ve had people who are Cabinet ministers for some purposes but not for others; Cabinet ministers who refuse to resign despite prima facie cases for doing so; a minister openly attacking another minister and claiming he was doing it not as a minister but as a former Far North district councillor; and then the amazing spectacle of one Cabinet minister who it now appears took the exit almost before he was tackled.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve had the shocking scandal of Labour spending half a million dollars over the legal limit on its election campaign, and using taxpayers&#39; money to do so, in flagrant breach of the rules.</p>
<p>Why the media haven&#39;t absolutely hammered Helen Clark for that disgraceful and illegal behaviour is absolutely beyond me.</p>
