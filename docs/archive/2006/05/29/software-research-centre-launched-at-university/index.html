<p>Software Research Centre launched at The University of Auckland</p>
<p>AUCKLAND 29 May 2006: A Centre for Software Innovation launched today at The University of Auckland aims to ensure the University’s expertise in computer science and software engineering is fully applied to a growing industry need.</p>
<p>Welcoming the new Centre, Dr Peter Lee, CEO of Auckland UniServices Limited, the University’s commercialisation company, said they had invested in the Centre because they saw very strong potential for growth in New Zealand’s ICT industry and a clear need to ensure New Zealand has the resources to stay ahead in a very fast-moving field.</p>
<p>“The Centre is the latest in a number of enterprises we are involved in developing at the University to ensure that specialist expertise is brought together to serve industries’ needs.</p>
<p>“We look forward to seeing the Centre helping its clients succeed and ensuring New Zealand organisations can compete with the world’s best.”</p>
<p>The Centre provides industry with a single point of access to the expertise of the University’s Departments of Computer Science, Electrical &amp;Computer Engineering and its Software Engineering Programme.</p>
<p>John Corey, the Centre’s Director, said keeping up with the very fast pace of software development was an increasingly pressing requirement. The Centre’s goal is to promote a culture of science and research among companies engaged in the development of products and services in the ICT sector, and to provide a collaborative environment for academic researchers and their counterparts in industry.</p>

<p>“The Centre will be a facilitator in the dialogue between our clients and the University’s research community – each has something to learn – each has something to contribute. Our business partners help us understand their commercial needs while we help them unlock the potential of the technology.”</p>
