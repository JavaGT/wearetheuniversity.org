<p>Nick Smith MP National Party Acting Civil Defence Spokesman</p>
<p>16 May 2006</p>
<p>Barker needs to admit we are not prepared</p>
<p>&quot;Civil Defence Minister Rick Barker has shown his contempt for the public by failing to admit the fatal flaws in New Zealand&#39;s emergency response planning,&quot; says National Party Acting Civil Defence spokesman Nick Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#39;s in total denial. Life and property are at risk but he refuses to admit his department&#39;s got major problems.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Smith is commenting on the latest criticisms of the Government&#39;s emergency planning. There has been strong criticism of central government&#39;s role by regional civil defence organisations up and down the country.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s been a serious disconnect between the Ministry, which Mr Barker is in charge of, and the grassroots organisations.</p>
<p>&quot;He cannot continue to ignore criticisms like those levelled by Canterbury Civil Defence, which says we&#39;re woefully ill-prepared; Wellington Civil Defence, which says planning is &#39;fatally flawed&#39;; and advice that suggests there&#39;s a &#39;gaping hole&#39; in the national emergency plan.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Barker still mistakenly believes the BBC was at fault for the botched response to the recent tsunami alert. It is simply ludicrous to blame a media outlet because Civil Defence in Wellington didn&#39;t answer their emergency phones.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Smith is predicting this week&#39;s Civil Defence tsunami exercise will be relatively trouble free.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s happening during office hours and they&#39;ve had plenty of warning so it should be okay. But during the only &#39;live&#39; operation recently the Ministry was found wanting.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Barker needs to understand that natural and unnatural disasters can happen at any time. His Ministry needs to be ready to go at a moment&#39;s notice.</p>
<p>&quot;He should stop passing the buck and start listening to regional civil defence operations which are always first to hit the ground during a disaster,&quot; says Dr Smith.</p>
