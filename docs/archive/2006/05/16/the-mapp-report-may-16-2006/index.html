<p>The Mapp Report</p>
<p>Innovation Forum</p>
<p>The first North Shore Innovation Forum was held with great success last Friday afternoon. Around 80 guests gathered to discuss business innovation in North Shore City and to listen to business experts, innovators, and educators.</p>
<p>Highlights of the Forum include hearing an insightful presentation by David Skilling, CEO of the New Zealand Institute, on what can be done to improve the current economic situation in New Zealand. Click here to view David&#39;s PowerPoint presentation. David set out three key requirements for the transformation of the New Zealand economy – greater savings incentives, much higher investment in research and development, and more focus on relevant higher education. His comments were backed up by several other speakers, including Professor David Raine, Deputy Vice Chancellor of Massey University, and comments from the audience.</p>
<p>Business innovators, Annette Presley, founder and CEO of Slingshot, and Jason Anderson, design manager of Adept Manufacturing, both presented case studies on how their businesses had become more innovative. These presentations gave a first hand insight into what businesses need to do to become more innovative, particularly when faced with competition from “bigger” companies.</p>
<p>In keeping with the North Shore theme, Maurice Boland from Enterprise North Shore and Mayor George Wood made presentations on what North Shore City can do to encourage and develop innovation in North Shore. Click here to view Maurice&#39;s PowerPoint presentation. We are lucky that so much effort has gone into improving North Shore’s infrastructure as this will be crucial to successfully attracting and maintaining innovative businesses.</p>

<p>A lively discussion followed the presentations, and attendees were invited to make comments and ask questions of myself, Jonathan Coleman, MP for Northcote, and David Bennett, MP for Hamilton East. It was decided during this discussion that a North Shore based innovation action group would be established to further the promotion of innovation on the North Shore. This group will be valuable in the development of key National Party policies on business and innovation.</p>
<p>Organ Donor Laws</p>
<p>North Shore resident, and long time supporter of our Takapuna office, Andy Tookey, has received overwhelming support in Parliament for his Bill to change the organ donation laws. Currently in New Zealand only 9.4 people out of every million people are donors. This is the lowest rate in the Western world.</p>
<p>Andy has been campaigning for a change to donor laws since his four-year old daughter was diagnosed with a rare liver condition at six-weeks old. It is likely she will need a liver transplant in the future.</p>
<p>Together with National MP Dr Jackie Blue, Andy has drafted the Human Tissues (organ donation) Amendment Bill. This Bill would prevent family members overturning the wishes of a registered donor.</p>
<p>Andy will be presenting a petition in support of the Bill to Parliament’s Health Selection Committee soon. If you would like to sign the online petition, or even have your say on the Bill by making a submission to Parliament then visit his website for more details: <a href="http://www.givelife.org.nz">www.givelife.org.nz</a></p>
