<p>Paula Bennett MP National Party Associate Industrial Relations Spokeswoman</p>
<p>16 May 2006</p>
<p>Are we really 39% sicker?</p>
<p>National Party Associate Industrial Relations spokeswoman Paula Bennett is calling on Labour to deny that a 39% increase in sick leave for some industries is a direct result of its clumsy Holidays Act changes.</p>
<p>&quot;Employer statements that it is costing more than $17 million in wage-bill blowouts are an inevitable consequence of a poorly designed policy that provides for relevant daily pay, including bonuses and overtime, even when an employee is sick.</p>
<p>&quot;One union has told the Otago Daily Times they do not &#39;blame some of these people for taking a couple of days off&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Employers don&#39;t have a problem if people take a couple of days off through genuine illness, but even Labour must start to question a 39% increase for some industries.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course it is the employer that directly picks up the tab, but in the long run it&#39;s the economy that suffers, as businesses are forced to pay for non-productive staff who aren&#39;t turning up for work.</p>
<p>&quot;Salary and wage earners should rightly expect to be rewarded for their efforts with a fair pay packet, and get reasonable time off when necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;But the unions should be very careful about defending what amounts to a rort of Labour&#39;s loose employment laws,&quot; says Ms Bennett.</p>
