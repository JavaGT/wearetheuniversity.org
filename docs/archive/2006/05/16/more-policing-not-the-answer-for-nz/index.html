<p>More Police; More Policing - not the answer for New Zealand Dr Pita Sharples Tuesday 16 May 2006</p>
<p>&quot;Again the Government gets it wrong&quot; says Dr Pita Sharples.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a terrible trend growing in our society for the hard-line approach to our problems and the Government is hell-bent on servicing these demands&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;More police, more prisons, stiffer penalties, a jail for twelve-year olds, preventative detention, more police powers to chase kids who &#39;might be&#39; prostitutes or graffiti artists; and micro-chipping dogs so you can catch them after they&#39;ve bitten somebody&quot;,</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa! Whoa!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When are we going to learn that the solution to many of the problems we face in our ever-so-small country will not be solved by force, by more laws and by still more laws?&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;One thousand police will not halt the domestic violence. In my electorate alone, of the last twelve murders of 2005/6, nine were domestic related; nine out of twelve people were killed by someone who loved them&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;As a society it is our responsibility to seek answers to why there is so much personal destruction within the family; this core unit of society which should be the greatest source of strength and support to individuals&quot; stated Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>&quot;To quote Judge Peter Boshier, &#39;We must ask why it is that some families seem to take within themselves, the most destructive and dysfunctional of behaviours, while others do not&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The harsh reality is we must look at the communities we are building or, are we destroying?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Many of our small towns and big city suburbs are characterized by low per capita incomes; higher levels of unemployment compared to the national average; insufficient provision of meaningful social services, insufficient community support amenities, poor levels of educational achievement; higher numbers of low decile schools; a disproportionate large young populations; and a higher number of single parent families&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it no wonder then that there are large numbers of dysfunctional families?&quot; asked Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to invest in &#39;the family&#39;; and not just some families, like the Government &#39;working for families&#39; package, which selects certain families and excludes others who are sometimes even worse off. We need to build communities, not ignore them&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps it is time to have a major review of Government spending through CYFS, Ministry of Social Development; the Department of Corrections; and all those Government Agencies which are ambulatory services.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to be creative and to seek ways to give those floundering country towns a new lease of life. We need to create more choices and more opportunities for those city suburbs which are trapped in restricted community solutions&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The emphasis must come off the &quot;more rules and more dependencies&quot; approach, and focus upon hope, development, nurturing and increased opportunity&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a beautiful country - it is now time to become more embracing; more caring; more sharing, as well as beautiful&quot;.</p>
