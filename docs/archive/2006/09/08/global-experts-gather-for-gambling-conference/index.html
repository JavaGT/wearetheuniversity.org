<p><strong>Friday, 8 September 2006, 5:22 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/AUT_University">AUT University</a></strong></p>
<p>Leading international and local experts on gambling are to attend a three-day conference at AUT University next week (subs: 13-15th Sept) to discuss the impacts of this growth industry.</p>
<p>The participants will examine the impacts of gambling on individuals, communities and societies says Professor Max Abbott, a keynote speaker and AUT University&#39;s Pro Vice-Chancellor, and Dean of the Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences.</p>
<p>&quot;A major purpose is to bring key stakeholders together and strengthen measures that will reduce gambling-related harms – to make a healthy difference.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Abbott says the conference will provide an opportunity for participants from throughout the world to discuss recent developments and innovations in gambling policy, practice and research.</p>
<p>The conference is hosted by the Gambling Research Centre, National Institute for Public Health and Mental Health Research, Auckland University of Technology and the Problem Gambling Foundation of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Discussions will range from problem gambling in the Asian community to community responsibility of addiction and gambling-related harm.</p>
<p>Leading international speaker Professor David Hodgins will describe his innovative treatment for problem gamblers, which involves self-help and telephone support. The United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration have recognised it as promising breakthrough for problem gamblers.</p>
<p>Two studies released last month – the 2002-03 New Zealand Health Survey and the Problem Gambling report – show poorer communities, Maori, and Pacific Island people, were hardest hit.</p>
