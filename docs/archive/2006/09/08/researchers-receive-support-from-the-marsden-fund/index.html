<p>The Marsden Fund has announced it will distribute $39.1 million to fund 78 new research projects nationwide, 26 of which are Fast-Start grants for outstanding new researchers. The funding will be spread over two to three years, depending on the project.</p>
<p>“Applications to the Fund are very competitive; with only a small percentage of the total number of applications successful,”said Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford. “I am delighted with the quality and range of University projects that have been funded this year; they constitute some very exciting research, with important applications socially, culturally and environmentally.”</p>
