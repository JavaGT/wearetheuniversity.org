<p>Top Linguist to lecture at Vic</p>
<p>The stories of English, Language Death and The Future of Language are the lectures to be presented by one of the world&#39;s leading commentators on language when he visits New Zealand later this month.</p>
<p>Professor David Crystal will be visiting New Zealand, from the UK, as the inaugural Ian Gordon Fellow in Linguistics at Victoria University of Wellington.</p>
<p>With over 100 books published Crystal has also been a consultant, contributor, and presenter on several radio and television programmes and series, including numerous BBC programmes since the 1980s.</p>
<p>He is currently patron of the International Association of Teachers of English as a Foreign Language (IATEFL), president of the UK National Literacy Association, and an honorary vice-president of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, the Institute of Linguists and the Society for Editors and Proofreaders.</p>
<p>Associate Professor David Crabbe, from Victoria University, has been instrumental in arranging Professor Crystal’s visit to New Zealand, and in setting up the Ian Gordon Fellowship.</p>
<p>“It will be great to have Professor Crystal at Victoria. I’m pleased to have the opportunity of arranging this visit, thanks to the generosity of the late Ian Gordon. I hope that students and members of the public take up the opportunity to attend the presentations and to learn from one of the top linguists in the world.”</p>
<p>About the Ian Gordon Fellowship</p>
<p>This fellowship was established in the final years of Emeritus Professor Ian Gordon’s life when he donated half a million dollars to the Victoria University Foundation to support his life-long passion for the study of language and his loyalty to Victoria University.</p>
<p>Well known as I.A. Gordon, he had his own radio show on National Radio and wrote a popular column on language in the New Zealand Listener. He also wrote 20 books, including A Word in Your Ear and Take My Word for It. He was an authority on the writings of Katherine Mansfield and Scottish novelist John Galt.</p>
