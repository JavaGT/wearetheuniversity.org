<p>Students Welcome Victoria Fee Decision</p>
<p>Students are welcoming the decision of the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) to reject the unjustified money grab by Victoria University.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has recognised that a 10% fee increase requires extraordinary justification, tertiary institutions now need to recognise this and find fairer income sources&quot; stated Joey Randall, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students&#39; Associations.</p>
<p>&quot;However the 5% increase in fees that Victoria students experienced this year and possibly next year are still significant and unjustifiable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The current Fees Maxima policy simply makes students the primary target of the Government&#39;s under-funding of tertiary education and only marginally stabilises fees.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fee increases of 5% per year are inexcusable. Labour likes to think it has taken the heat out of the on average 14% per year fee rises we saw from National in the 1990&#39;s, but it just seems like Labour is the same beast - only going a bit slower.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In Australian Universities, the Government contributes 46% of the institutions total funding, whilst here in New Zealand the Government contributes only 38%. It is not good enough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Also in Australian Universities, student fees only contributed 19% of the institutions income compared with 31% here, the Government shouldn&#39;t be passing the cost of an under-funded tertiary education system onto students.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We call upon the Government to recognise the under-funding of our public tertiary education system and to address this problem immediately,&quot; Mr Randall concluded.</p>
