<p>Hon Bill English National Party Education Spokesman</p>

<p>Few options for 44% of low-decile school leavers</p>
<p>More than four out of ten students at low-decile (1-3) secondary schools leave with very limited options for further study or training, says National&#39;s Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Ministry of Education claimed that just 13% of students leave school without a qualification.</p>
<p>But Mr English says Labour&#39;s definition of qualification is &quot;nonsense&quot;, and the actual proportion of students who leave school without a qualification is 27% - including 44% of school leavers from low-decile schools.</p>
<p>&quot;According to Labour, any student achieving 13 of the 80 NCEA credits required to reach level 1 NCEA has a qualification.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour might regard one sixth of the credits required for NCEA level 1 as a qualification, but no one else does.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey is misleading students and their parents by telling them a handful of credits provides them with choices when they leave school.</p>
<p>&quot;More and more trade and skills courses require NCEA level 1 as a prerequisite for enrolment. So 44% of students leaving low-decile schools have almost no chance of getting into pre-apprenticeship course.</p>
<p>&quot;The only option for them then is to pay $3,000 to $4,000 for a foundation course to get the basic qualification they didn&#39;t get at school.</p>
<p>&quot;National believes in lifting standards across the board and taking action where students fall short of the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;We would require schools to report the progress of their students towards national literacy and numeracy standards so that failure can be identified early on and something done about it,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
