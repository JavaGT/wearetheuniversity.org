<p>Leading marine scientist to speak at Victoria</p>
<p>A leading British expert on sea level change and coastal flooding is to give a public lecture at Victoria University next week.</p>
<p>Dr David Pugh, OBE, will be giving a lecture on Marine Science and Ocean Governance at Victoria University’s Pipitea Campus on 3 October.</p>
<p>Dr Pugh is hosted by Victoria University’s Centre for Marine Environmental &amp; Economic Research, in conjunction with the Institute of Marine Engineering, Science &amp; Technology (IMarEST).</p>
<p>He will address issues such as whether anything can be done to stop irreversible damage to the oceans, and how the high seas can be monitored and managed effectively, given that most are outside all national control.</p>
<p>The lecture is part of a series of presentations by Dr Pugh in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin to discuss marine science topics of current importance, and also to promote the activities of the IMarEST in the region.</p>
<p>Dr Pugh is Chairman of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, and has been involved in negotiations among Governments, in the United Nations and at many international meetings. He is also a Vice-President and Trustee of the IMarEST.</p>
<p>Dr Jonathan Gardner, Reader in Marine Biology and Director of the Centre for Marine Environmental &amp; Economic Research, says he is pleased Dr Pugh is to present the seminar.</p>
<p>“It is a privilege for Victoria to be visited by a scientist of Dr Pugh’s calibre. Human activities have had a significant and irreversible impact on our oceans and the marine environment, and David’s presentation is sure to be informative and topical.”</p>
<p>Dr Pugh’s lecture will be held in LT1 at Victoria University’s Government Building, Lambton Quay, on Tuesday 3 October from 5.30pm to 7pm.</p>
