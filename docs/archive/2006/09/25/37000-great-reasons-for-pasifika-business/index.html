<p>37,000 great reasons for Pasifika business enterprise</p>
<p>With $37,000 worth of tertiary scholarships up for grabs, Counties Manukau&#39;s top Pasifika students are preparing to showcase their entrepreneurial endeavour at a business enterprise showdown.</p>
<p>This Friday, nine teams of Year 12 and 13 Pasifika entrepreneurs from seven schools will strut their business stuff at the Plantation Business Challenge 2006.</p>
<p>Now in its second year, the competition is a platform for high school students to create a product or service and develop a business plan around it.</p>
<p>Throughout the five-day challenge, teams are mentored by Pasifika business leaders, senior lecturers and AUT&#39;s Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE AUT) business students, who advise on marketing, research, finance, HR and contingency planning.</p>
<p>On the final day, the groups will present their business plans to a panel of judges where projects are assessed against real-world criteria, such as marketability, research, product differentiation and financial viability.</p>
<p>AUT is contributing a scholarship worth up to $15,000 to study business at the university.</p>
<p>AUT Pasifika liaison Ronji Tanielu says the success of the inaugural Plantation Business Challenge means not only business people are taking notice of young Pasifika entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year&#39;s winners were contacted by a major New Zealand media conglomerate with regard to making their project a reality,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;This Challenge is more than a school competition. It&#39;s about providing young Pacific people who are interested in business, entrepreneurship and achievement with the professional business mentoring, academic support and financial assistance they deserve to achieve their ambitions.&quot;</p>
