<p>NZEI Vision For Quality Public Education</p>
<p>Zealand’s largest education union, NZEI Te Riu Roa, has today launched a position paper that sets out its members’ vision for building a quality public education service in New Zealand for the 21st century.</p>
<p>Entitled ‘QPE 4 21C: Quality Public Education For The 21st Century,’ the paper was endorsed by the 400 NZEI members attending the union’s Annual Meeting in Wellington.</p>
<p>“This paper outlines how we can build a public education service which will ensure the education of New Zealand children is of the highest quality,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Irene Cooper.</p>
<p>“It puts a stake in the ground and states emphatically where NZEI members stand on the issue of education provision in the 21st century.”</p>
<p>“We say that for the students of New Zealand to succeed the education system must be free, well resourced and universally accessible,” says Irene Cooper.</p>
<p>The quality public education service envisioned by NZEI members is based on four principles. That education is a human right and a public good. That every child is entitled to a good local school and a good local early childhood education centre. That every child is entitled to quality learning. And that teachers play a critical role in providing quality learning.</p>
<p>“We acknowledge that not all young New Zealanders are achieving their potential,” says Irene Cooper.</p>
<p>“We know that a child’s financial and social circumstances affect their learning. But we also know that a well resourced public education service can do a lot to level the educational playing field.”</p>
<p>“NZEI members believe that everyone in the country shares the responsibility of ensuring that all our children reach their potential.”</p>
<p>“We must all work together, schools, families and whanau, and governments, to identify the barriers, change the attitudes and overcome the hurdles, that are causing some of our children to fail.”</p>
<p>“We invite anyone who shares NZEI members’ passion for education to read the paper, debate it,<br>then join us in building a quality public education for the 21st century,” says Irene Cooper.</p>
