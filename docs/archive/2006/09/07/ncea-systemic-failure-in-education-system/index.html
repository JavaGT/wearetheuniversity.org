<p>NCEA: Systemic failure in education system</p>
<p>The fact that one in six students at some of the country’s most affluent schools leave with very limited options for the future shows that under-achievement is systemic in the education system, says National’s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>He has released figures showing that 27% of all students leave school without achieving the NCEA level 1 qualification –the equivalent of the old School Certificate. One in six students from high-decile (8-10) schools do not achieve the basic qualification.</p>
<p>“Many parents assume their child is guaranteed success if they attend a high-decile school, but these NCEA results prove that’s far from the case,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“More than a quarter (28.3%) of students leave a high-decile school with just Level 1 NCEA or less. Any student knows that leaving school with a Level 1 pass means limited choices and difficult access to tertiary education and training.</p>
<p>“But Labour continues to count failure as success.”</p>
<p>Last week, the Ministry of Education claimed that just 13% of students leave school without a qualification.</p>
<p>But Mr English says Labour’s definition of qualification is “nonsense”, and the actual proportion of students who leave school without a qualification is more than double that.</p>
<p>“According to Labour, any student achieving 13 of the 80 NCEA credits required to reach level 1 NCEA has a qualification.</p>

<p>“So Labour is counting the thousands of students who fail level 1 as a success. A student with just 13 credits does not have a qualification. They need 80 credits.</p>
<p>“Steve Maharey is misleading students and their parents by telling them that a handful of credits provides them with choices when they leave school,” says Mr English.</p>
