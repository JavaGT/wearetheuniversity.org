<p>Otago Researchers Gain Major Marsden Funding</p>
<p>University of Otago researchers have gained nearly $11 million to undertake ideas-driven research in the Government’s latest Marsden funding round announced today.</p>
<p>The 18 Otago projects funded out of the highly-competitive fund range from research into male brain development, Melanesian pre-history, how honey bee queens use chemicals to control their subjects; through to lasers which work as “optical tweezers” for microscopic particles.</p>
<p>Other innovative projects include investigating mechanisms behind sleep-related lowering in blood supply, which is a factor in strokes, the neuroscience behind how brains make choices and a new model of evolution and animal development.</p>
<p>Research Deputy-Vice-Chancellor Geoff White warmly congratulated the successful applicants who came from across the University’s Health Sciences, Humanities and Sciences Divisions.</p>
<p>“This is an outstanding outcome – it’s a real tribute to both their high calibre as researchers and the effort that went into putting together their top-notch applications,” says Prof White.</p>
<p>“Our researchers’ stellar performance backs up Otago’s recent ranking as New Zealand’s most research-intensive university and shows our continuing emphasis on fostering a strong research culture among staff is bearing fruit.”</p>
<p>This year, Otago received the highest number of research contracts awarded to any institution, in what is an increasingly highly-competitive funding round, he says.</p>
<p>Prof White noted that only about six per cent of the initial applications around the country were ultimately successful.</p>
