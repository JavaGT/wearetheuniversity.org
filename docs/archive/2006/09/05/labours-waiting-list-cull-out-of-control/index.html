<p>Hon Tony Ryall National Party Health Spokesman</p>
<p>5 September 2006</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s waiting list cull out of control</p>
<p>National&#39;s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall, says the Labour Government&#39;s directive to DHBs to cull their waiting lists means it is even harder for patients to get into hospital.</p>
<p>He is commenting as Waitemata DHB prepares to cull 800 patients from its waiting lists by the end of the month.</p>
<p>A report from Waitemata DHB says that as a result of the waiting list culls, &#39;some patients previously given certainty of treatment may now be declined treatment&#39;.</p>
<p>It also says that: &#39;From now on primary care will also notice tighter acceptance thresholds in some services&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Around the country, thousands of patients have been sent back to their GPs with no idea of when, or if, they will ever get their operations,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has threatened financial penalties for DHBs that don&#39;t wipe their waiting lists.</p>
<p>&quot;This waiting list cull is now out of control.</p>
<p>&quot;Doctors and specialists have said their patients need hospital care, but they are being culled by Government edict anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;And that&#39;s going to affect more and more New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;The harsh reality is that Labour&#39;s waiting list cull is forcing even more patients into paying for their own operations.</p>
<p>&quot;National says we could get more elective services through smart use of the private sector, greater involvement of specialists in decision-making, cuts to bureaucracy, and moving resources into services through a greater focus on value for money.&quot;</p>
