<p>Victoria’s tourism programme has double celebration</p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington’s Tourism programme has cause for double celebration this week.</p>
<p>Not only does the programme, in the Victoria Management School, celebrate its 10th anniversary but also being the first in New Zealand to be awarded with the internationally recognised TedQual certification.</p>
<p>TedQual certification has been awarded by the World Tourism Organization after independent external auditing of the degrees and of the University as a whole.</p>
<p>“It was a lengthy and rigorous process. The World Tourism Organization sent an Auditor over from the UK to look at the teaching curriculum, the processes, management of the School and of the University as a whole, and they reviewed our links with the tourism industry” says Professor Doug Pearce, Professor in Tourism Management at Victoria University.</p>
<p>Is it worth the effort? TedQual certification provides students, staff and employers with assurance that the quality of these degrees meets worldwide standards.</p>
<p>Professor Pearce says “we are really proud to have been awarded the TedQual certification, especially so, since we are the first university in New Zealand to receive it and the timing’s perfect with notification arriving in time to combine this celebration with those for the 10th anniversary.</p>
<p>“It’s taken a lot of hard work from a very dedicated team to create such a high quality programme but being recognised in this way makes it all worthwhile.”</p>

<p>As the 10th anniversary approaches plans are being made to develop the programmes even further in the future.</p>
<p>“Tourism is a leading sector of the economy with an increasing need for skilled staff and managers to meet the challenges of an ever competitive world. We are constantly making plans for developments to ensure we retain our position as a leading education provider in the tourism industry.”</p>
<p>The Victoria University degrees which have been awarded TedQual certification are the Bachelor of Tourism Management, Bachelor of Tourism Management (Hons) and Master of Tourism Management.</p>
<p>The World Tourism Organization, headquartered in Madrid, developed the TedQual certification system to contribute to the quality and efficiency of tourism education and training in one of the leading sectors of the economy.</p>
