<p>Teachers turned food police</p>
<p>Teachers will have to be trained experts on diet to comply with new Government rules on food in schools, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>He is commenting on the Government&#39;s plan to turn teachers into food police as part of its anti-obesity campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;Teachers don&#39;t make children&#39;s lunches, parents do, but this campaign puts all the responsibility on to teachers.</p>
<p>&quot;Education Minister Steve Maharey has said the new guidelines are an effective ban on some foods, and that the Education Review Office will monitor schools&#39; compliance.</p>
<p>&quot;But how will a teacher know whether the sausage sizzle for the netball team complies with the new rules if they don&#39;t know what&#39;s in the sausages, or whether the peanut butter sandwich is legal if it has jam in it as well?</p>
<p>&quot;If the Government wants to ban some foods and drinks then they should just go ahead and do it, and take full responsibility.</p>
<p>&quot;Teachers are too busy teaching children the basics and looking after their social problems to take on the job of food police as well,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
