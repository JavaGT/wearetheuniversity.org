<p>Hodgson hypocritical on obesity</p>
<p>Pete Hodgson has been shown up as having double standards in the obesity campaign, says National&#39;s Associate Health spokeswoman Dr Jackie Blue.</p>
<p>She is commenting following the announcement of Mission-On, a healthy lifestyles package that will effectively ban from schools foods and drinks high in sugar, fat and salt.</p>
<p>&quot;The irony is that our hospitals are littered with vending machines selling exactly these sorts of drinks and foods.”</p>
<p>Dr Blue recently surveyed the 21 DHBs about their vending machines.</p>
<p>&quot;To date, two-thirds of the DHBs have replied. They all have snack and/or drink vending machines on their sites.</p>
<p>“Auckland DHB has a whopping 50 snack and drink vending machines, and makes $144,000 profit each year from them. Counties Manukau DHB has 36 machines, and Waikato has 32.</p>
<p>“Waitemata DHB has 25 vending machines but has removed all unhealthy drink options. The contractor who provides the machines gives half the profits to a trust.</p>
<p>“Other DHBs have a varying number of vending machines but receive little or no profit.</p>
<p>“As well as being a hypocrite, Pete Hodgson is missing the point – any initiative will only be successful if there is support and buy-in from the community and, more importantly, from families,” says Dr Blue.</p>
