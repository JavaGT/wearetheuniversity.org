<p>Media Release:<br>For immediate release 22 September.</p>
<p>Students Elect New UCSA President</p>
<p>Belinda Bundy has been elected as the University of Canterbury Students’ Association (UCSA) President for 2007. Thousands of students went to the polls on Wednesday and Thursday to vote for their student representatives and the Electoral Returning Officer officially released the results early this morning. Bundy was awarded the presidency after beating her closet competition by 908 votes with a total of 1,280 votes; “I’m very pleased to have been elected and humbled by the support of so many students” she said.</p>
<p>Claire Piper was elected Vice President after polling the highest with over 1000 votes. There has not been a female president of the UCSA for ten years, and this will be the first time in recent memory the UCSA has been headed by two women. The two said that they were proud to be ushering in a new era of student representation at the University of Canterbury. Ten Executive members were also elected, and they represent a diverse range of students on campus.</p>
<p>This year’s election was hotly contested with a total of 27 candidates putting themselves forward. Outgoing President Warren Poh said he was pleased with the number of people standing for election, and noted that “…it bodes well for the future of the UCSA if there is this amount of student interest in the running of the organisation”.</p>
<p>Bundy, Piper and the Executive team assume their official duties at the beginning of 2007.</p>
