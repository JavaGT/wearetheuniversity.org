<p>Trust The People</p>

<p>Speech to the Institute of Economic Affairs, London, Friday 22 September 2006.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a huge buzz, as a Kiwi, stepping off the plane in London - the land of Big Ben, Shakespeare and &#39;mind the gap&#39;.</p>
<p>This is a journey that thousands of New Zealanders make - even though Heather Roy and I aren&#39;t joining the expatriate community for long.</p>
<p>Isn&#39;t it strange that, wherever Kiwis go, we quickly find other Kiwis to live, work and play with?</p>
<p>We love being able to travel halfway around the world, and still find little slices of New Zealand.</p>
<p>To be able to go to the Redback, the New Zealand Shop, the Walkabout or Flat White.</p>
<p>And no matter how far away we are, part of us always feels at home.</p>
<p>Popular opinion suggests that there are three main reasons people make this journey - to travel into Europe, to escape their student loan, or to seek out better job opportunities.</p>
<p>As politicians, we have come to learn. To learn about what&#39;s working here, in Ireland and in Germany.</p>
<p>We will take back those new ideas to make our own country more free and prosperous.</p>
<p>I lead a party of free-market liberals, and represent the people of the Epsom electorate.</p>
<p>We are a small but independent part of New Zealand&#39;s political landscape.</p>
<p>We remain strong and independent because we remind ourselves constantly what we stand for.</p>
<p>Freedom and prosperity.</p>
<p>Individual responsibility.</p>
<p>A better vision for New Zealand.</p>

<p>We remind ourselves of what New Zealanders are, and what we can achieve.</p>
<p>Today, Heather Roy and I are the only MPs in our Parliament advocating freedom, choice and personal responsibility, but in the 1980s, New Zealand led the world.</p>
<p>Sir Roger Douglas, the Labour Party&#39;s Finance Minister, who went on to be one of ACT&#39;s founders, introduced the free market to New Zealand&#39;s economy.</p>
<p>That Labour government gave us more freedom and choice.</p>
<p>Now ACT stands in opposition to a Labour government which is taking choices away.</p>
<p>As economists, we know what works to deliver more prosperity.</p>
<p>Small government.</p>
<p>Politicians having less control, and citizens having more.</p>
<p>That&#39;s what ACT is in Parliament to deliver.</p>
<p>Less government results in a prosperous economy, a strong society and a quality of life that is the envy of the world.</p>
<p>We will get there by trading globally, by taking care of our environment, and by trusting the people.</p>
<p>As David Cameron has said, the more we trust people, the stronger they become.</p>
<p>ACT trusts people to make their own choices - about the health and education of their family, and about their role in the economy.</p>
<p>Freedom and choice are enduring ideas.</p>
<p>We would implement them through enduring policies.</p>
<p>Enduring policies we&#39;ve already seen include the Fiscal Responsibility Act, where Government has to tell Treasury every six months about all the decisions they&#39;ve made that involve spending money. Treasury then have to prepare a four-year forecast.</p>
<p>That makes government more transparent and accountable. Politicians can no longer commit taxpayer funds in secret.</p>
<p>The effect was immediate. Every New Zealand government had run a deficit every year of my life.</p>
<p>That&#39;s how they would win votes - by spending the money now, and piling up the bills for future generations to deal with.</p>
<p>No government has run a deficit in any year since the passing of the Fiscal Responsibility Act.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve also got the Reserve Bank Act that tamed inflation.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank Governor has one objective - price stability. His inflation target is set by the Minister of Finance, publicly and in writing.</p>
<p>New Zealand now has price stability. Our politicians don&#39;t just let the printing presses rip, running up a debt tomorrow to buy an election today.</p>
<p>These laws have survived elections. Our tax and spend parties have been in government, and not repealed them.</p>
<p>Because if they did, New Zealanders would know what they were up to.</p>
<p>So what did those Acts have in common?</p>
<p>They made political decision-making more transparent and politicians more accountable to the voters.</p>
<p>So the solutions we should be advocating are precisely those.</p>
<p>The more politicians are accountable, the better decisions we will get.</p>
<p>It&#39;s when they can hide things that they get away with it.</p>
<p>We recently had a test run, when I introduced a Bill to constrain the size of local government.</p>
<p>If local councils wanted to increase their rates revenue by more than two percent above the level of inflation, they needed to ask ratepayers through a referendum.</p>
<p>That Bill nearly had the numbers to go for public submissions.</p>
<p>In the event, the Government has had to announce an inquiry into the cost of local councils.</p>
<p>The next step would be to cap central government expenditure - but only in line with population growth and inflation.</p>
<p>Politicians would have to spend within their budget - just as families do.</p>
<p>If they want to spend more money, in real terms, taxpayers would have to give their explicit consent.</p>
<p>Those are rules built to last because we&#39;d say, as a people, that if you want to take more of our money, you need to get our permission.</p>
<p>The next Bill I will take before Parliament in November is a Regulatory Responsibility Bill.</p>
<p>It says that, before making a law, Parliament has to publicly answer a few key questions.</p>
<p>Like &#39;what is this law for?&#39;</p>
<p>&#39;What will it cost?&#39;</p>
<p>And &#39;what will it achieve?&#39;</p>
<p>After a time period, the rules would have to be reviewed, to see if they work.</p>
<p>Politicians would be made accountable to the people for the regulations they passed.</p>
<p>And that would cut the cost of useless law and pointless red tape.</p>
<p>If the political parties stick to their pre-election promises, my Bill will get the support it needs to go through to public submissions.</p>
<p>We believe, in ACT, that less government and better government walk hand in hand.</p>
<p>That greater opportunity comes from having fewer barriers to trading between nations.</p>
<p>And that just as we separate church from state, we should separate the state from business.</p>
<p>Politicians and businessmen have very different incentives.</p>
<p>The incentive for business is to make money by satisfying customers.</p>
<p>Businesses need to provide what people want.</p>
<p>Unlike businesses, politicians don&#39;t go bust.</p>
<p>They don&#39;t need to provide anything.</p>
<p>But politicians feel we need to.</p>
<p>It makes us look important. Powerful. Competent.</p>
<p>Which is why, in New Zealand, the State owns power companies, a bank, an airline, the post office, radio and television networks.</p>
<p>None of our Cabinet Ministers owned a radio station, a power company or a bank before coming to Parliament.</p>
<p>We&#39;re told that these are assets held in trust for the people - but politicians without experience or proper incentives make bad trustees.</p>
<p>The people didn&#39;t choose to own them - they can&#39;t opt out.</p>
<p>Politicians appoint the managers, and taxpayers take all the risk.</p>
<p>Citizens who could put their share of these investments to better use, like having a hip operation, are denied that opportunity.</p>
<p>If State assets are the people&#39;s assets, they should be owned and managed by the people.</p>
<p>I would return shares in State owned assets to the citizens of New Zealand.</p>
<p>That would give every Kiwi a real stake in our economy.</p>
<p>New Zealand families would have real choice, real power and real opportunities.</p>
<p>Families would prosper through selling the shares they don&#39;t want to keep, and collecting the dividends on those they do.</p>
<p>Margaret Thatcher began to separate the state from business, right here in the UK, about 25 years ago. Governments around the world followed.</p>
<p>Here, as at home, there is still unfinished business.</p>
<p>Few countries opt for fast, large-scale economic reforms.</p>
<p>But many crave more freedom and greater choice.</p>
<p>By making the actions of politicians and Government transparent, and giving the people a stake in our country&#39;s economy, we can deliver that freedom and choice.</p>
<p>We can have strong citizens and prosperous economies.</p>
<p>If we trust the people.</p>
