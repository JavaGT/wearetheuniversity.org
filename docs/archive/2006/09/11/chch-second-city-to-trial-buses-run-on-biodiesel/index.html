<p>Chch second city to trial buses run on biodiesel</p>
<p>Christchurch has become the second New Zealand city after Auckland to trial some of its bus fleet on cleaner-burning biodiesel, says National Associate Environment spokeswoman Nicky Wagner.</p>
<p>&quot;The 12-month trial was a major step towards improving Christchurch&#39;s urban air quality.</p>
<p>&quot;National sees alternative fuels as part of the solution to climate change and energy security. This trial is expected to show biodiesel can be an efficient and cost-effective alternative to dirty-burning fuels.</p>
<p>``The rapid growth of passenger transport in this country is essential to controlling congestion on roads and improving air quality. We won&#39;t need to import as much imported crude oil either.</p>
<p>The trial, run by Environment Canterbury, was launched in Cathedral Square today. Ms Wagner is chairwoman of Environment Canterbury&#39;s public passenger portfolio.</p>
<p>&quot;The trial will create awareness among the public and visitors that biodiesel is a serious alternative for the future. Other cities around the world have been successfully running biodiesel buses for some years,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&quot;Four Christchurch buses will use the biodiesel blend of both plant oil and animal fat. Other types of biodiesel may be introduced into some of the buses during the trial.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand&#39;s transport sector has the fastest growing demand for energy and is responsible for 45% of New Zealand&#39;s greenhouse emissions.</p>
<p>&quot;This trial will help evaluate the potential to convert not just buses but also trucks and taxis to run on biodiesel.&quot;</p>
<p>The biggest potential source of biodiesel in New Zealand is tallow, an animal fat that is a by-product of meat processing. New Zealand produces around 150,000 tonnes of tallow a year, most of which could be made into biodiesel.</p>
