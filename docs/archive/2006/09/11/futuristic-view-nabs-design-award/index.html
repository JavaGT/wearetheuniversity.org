<p>Futuristic view nabs design award</p>
<p>A staff handbook for a fictional future company has won AUT graduate Tristan O&#39;Shannessy one of the industry&#39;s most coveted design awards.</p>
<p>O&#39;Shannessy&#39;s Earth Empire Staff Handbook 2025 was named winner of the hotly contested student graphic category at this year&#39;s BeST Design Awards on 25 August.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea is loosely based on the idea of a communist manifesto, Chairman Mao&#39;s Little Red Book and brand standards manuals,&quot; says O&#39;Shannessy. &quot;The fictional company is best described as Bill Gates meets George Bush, amplified.&quot;</p>
<p>Since completing his Bachelor of Graphic Design at AUT last year, Ponsonby resident O&#39;Shannessy has been in demand.</p>
<p>After being contacted by several of the agencies who visited AUT&#39;s end-of-year graphic design graduate exhibition, he accepted a job with large brand-design firm the Maxim Group. From there, he recently moved to smaller, up-and-coming agency Milk.</p>
<p>&quot;The move will give me a chance to work on big jobs with a small team, so lots of hands-on experience. I plan to stay with them for some time,&quot; says O&#39;Shannessy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he managed to find the time to get married and is expecting his first child in October. &quot;Life is moving fast,&quot; he says.</p>
