<p>Strikes: Will Labour finally take note?</p>
<p>National’s Industrial Relations spokesman, Wayne Mapp, says he hopes the radiographers’strike will make Labour finally acknowledge the dangerous path its union-centric employment legislation is leading the country down.</p>
<p>“This latest industrial dispute has lead to 14 hospitals grinding to a near halt and the wellbeing of thousands of patients being put in jeopardy.</p>
<p>“Though this is a terrible situation for all concerned, I hope the risks associated with this strike will cause Labour to take notice.</p>
<p>“The radiographers’ strike is just the latest in a long line of industrial disputes since Labour made changes to the Employment Relations Act in 2004. Those changes have had a multimillion-dollar impact on the economy.</p>
<p>“And it’s certainly not good enough that lives are now being put at risk.</p>
<p>“National said these changes, born of sweetheart deals with their union funders, would cause problems, and they have.</p>
<p>“Neither Labour nor the union leaders have any concern for the impact of such industrial action on families and economies.”</p>
<p>In the year to March 2006 there were 66 work stoppages resulting in an estimated $5.1 million in lost wages and salaries. This compares with 32 stoppages in the previous year.</p>
<p>“This increasing strike action marks a return to the bad old days of union domination. Labour has reduced the freedom of non-union workers and employers, making it much more difficult to do business and access essential services,” says Dr Mapp.</p>
<p>“In Government, National will remove the union preference and the ‘us v them’mentality it has brought to employment law.”</p>
