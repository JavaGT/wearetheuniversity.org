<p>Hon Bill English<br>National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>1 September 2006</p>
<p>Labour should focus on quality of qualification</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English says the Labour Government should focus on the quality of NCEA qualifications, rather than trumpeting about a small increase in the number of students completing them.</p>
<p>He is commenting on the Ministry of Education’s release today of school-leavers’ statistics, which show there has been a 1% increase in the number of secondary students gaining University Entrance.</p>
<p>The Ministry also claims that just 13% of students leave school with no qualification.</p>
<p>But Mr English says the Minister has no way of knowing whether this increase is due to improved teaching or whether it’s the result of lower standards.</p>
<p>“The Ministry’s claim that just 13% leave school with no qualification is dubious when almost a third of students fail the basic level 1 NCEA literacy standard.</p>
<p>“I find it very hard to understand how these students can gain the national qualification without a basic competency in literacy. If they can, we are all in a lot of trouble.”</p>
