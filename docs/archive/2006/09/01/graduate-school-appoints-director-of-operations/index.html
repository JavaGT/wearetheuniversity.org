<p>Graduate School appoints first Director of Operations</p>
<p>Mike Groves will lead the drive to produce world-class business talent as the first Director of Operations at New Zealand’s only Graduate School of Enterprise.</p>
<p>The Graduate School of Enterprise is the home of postgraduate and masters programmes at The University of Auckland Business School. It has been specifically designed to meet the economic challenges facing New Zealand through a focus on enterprise, leadership and world-class teaching and research.</p>
<p>Mr Groves has had a distinguished 39-year career in business. He has been at the Business School for 17 years as Senior Lecturer in Marketing, Director of the Diploma Programme and – most recently - as Director of Short Courses.</p>
<p>“Through the GSE we hope to lift the competency of the nation by providing relevant, practical learning soundly based on rigorous theory to experienced business and professional practitioners,” Mr Groves says.</p>
<p>Darren Levy has taken on the role of Acting Director of Short Courses in the place of Mr Groves.</p>
