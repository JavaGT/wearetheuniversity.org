<p>10 Unemployment Benefit Debts Total $1.2 Million</p>
<p>Parliamentary questions released by ACT Social Services Spokesman, Heather Roy, show that ten people caught defrauding the Unemployment Benefit owe debts totalling $1,256,102.28, with the largest single debt at $174,686.90.</p>
<p>&quot;Government is soft on people abusing our welfare system, and too many people effectively get away with benefit fraud&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;More than 17,000 people receiving Unemployment Benefits owed money to the taxpayer at the end of June 2006.</p>
<p>&quot;Minister for Social Development and Employment, David Benson-Pope, recently stated that his Ministry &#39;is committed to recovering any and all debt it is owed&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet these debts are being repaid at between $20 and $47.50 a week. The largest debt could take 167 years to repay.</p>
<p>&quot;Repayments are so pathetic that, in practice, the taxpayer will never be reimbursed.</p>
<p>&quot;The Unemployment Benefit exists so people can receive the assistance, support and encouragement they need to return to work. Large-scale fraud like this not only rips off taxpayers, but reflects unfairly on people in real need as well.</p>
<p>&quot;One of these cases, representing tens of thousands of dollars, was not even prosecuted.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not about bashing beneficiaries, it&#39;s about dealing with fraud.</p>
<p>&quot;I am calling on David Benson-Pope to come clean with the public about the scale of benefit fraud, and to get tough on people ripping off taxpayers&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
