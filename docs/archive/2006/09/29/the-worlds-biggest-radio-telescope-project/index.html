<p><strong>Friday, 29 September 2006, 9:47 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology">Auckland University of Technology</a></strong></p>

<p>Government support is crucial to help Australia and New Zealand win their bid to host the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), says the scientist driving New Zealand&#39;s role in the world&#39;s biggest radio telescope project.</p>
<p>The US$1 billion SKA project will let scientists probe radiation sources so distant that they must have originated about 13 billion years ago, near the beginning of the universe.</p>
<p>AUT University Professor and radio astronomer Sergei Gulyaev is delighted with today&#39;s announcement [subs: embargoed to midnight Sept 28 NZ time] that the Australia-New Zealand consortium has beaten off bids from China and Argentina/Brazil to host SKA. The only rival remaining is Southern Africa.</p>
<p>Announcing its decision, the International SKA Steering Committee said both the Australasian consortium and Southern Africa could meet the full range of requirements for the SKA.</p>
<p>But Professor Gulyaev says New Zealand may have to pull out of the project without government funding to build and maintain a radio telescope with sufficient collecting area.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a disgrace if the SKA finally lands in Australia without New Zealand being part of it,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the knowledge and technology, we have the right conditions – all we need now is the financial backing to make it a reality.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Gulyaev is director of AUT&#39;s Centre for Radiophysics and Space Research, the New Zealand partner in the Australasian SKA Consortium.</p>
<p>&quot;The consortium has worked hard on this for two years and now we have made it to the final two. For a relatively small investment, New Zealand has an unparalleled opportunity to be part of what will be one of the world&#39;s biggest science projects. It will give the country huge international prestige.&quot;</p>

<p>Professor Gulyaev says the Centre needs about $3 million to install a suitable telescope. At the moment, it is using a 6m dish belonging to Auckland amateur radio operator Brent Addis.</p>
<p>SKA will study, among other things, the centre of our Galaxy – the Milky Way – and the most powerful sources of energy in the Universe, the nuclei of active galaxies and quasar systems.</p>
<p>The core site of the Australasian bid will be in Western Australia, with satellites spread across Australia. Two/three sites in New Zealand are proposed – Warkworth and Ardmore in the North Island and Awarua and Rangiora in the South Island.</p>
<p>Sir Ian Axford, Chair of SKANZ (New Zealand SKA Committee) and former head of Germany&#39;s Max Planck Institute for Aeronomics, backs Professor Gulyaev&#39;s call for government support.</p>
<p>&quot;SKA could be the most important project of this kind ever undertaken in New Zealand, and it would bring us to the forefront of international research and development in a very exciting field,&quot; he says. &quot;The opportunity should not be missed.&quot;</p>
<p>The final site decision is expected by 2010.</p>
