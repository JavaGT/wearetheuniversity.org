<p>Hodgson condoning patient suffering</p>
<p>Health Minister Pete Hodgson must immediately instruct DHBs to get back to the negotiating table as provincial hospitals prepare for another week of disruption, says National’s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>He is commenting on reports that the radiographers’ union is ready to negotiate, but DHBs have refused.</p>
<p>“By sitting on his hands and ignoring this crisis, Mr Hodgson is condoning the suffering of patients up and down the country,” says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;He has become too distracted supporting the Mallard dirt-file and the pledge card scandal to deal with it.</p>
<p>&quot;He calls himself Labour’s strategist. He&#39;s doing a hopeless job in health, with the sector facing never-ending industrial chaos.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has been told that thousands more patients will be affected this week. Two days of industrial action disrupts all kinds of surgery and hospital care.</p>
<p>“Mr Hodgson told DHBs earlier this year he had an appetite for industrial action – patients are paying for that this week.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government must instruct its DHB negotiators to go back to the table. It’s not too late to avoid another week of disruption,” says Mr Ryall.</p>
