<p>Hon Bill English National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>4 September 2006</p>
<p>Prayers in school: parent power beats Labour</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English says parent power forced the Labour Government to back down on its &quot;loopy&quot; proposal for guidelines on religious instruction in schools.</p>
<p>&quot;But I am concerned that it took such ridicule from parents and the involvement of Anglican Bishops and the Opposition Education spokesman to inject some commonsense into the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>&quot;A guideline that makes it against the rules for children to sing &#39;How Great Thou Art&#39; at school but says it&#39;s okay to sing &#39;Whakaaria Mai&#39;, its Maori translation, defies commonsense.</p>
<p>&quot;The guideline was not a solution to a problem because there was no problem in the first place.</p>
<p>&quot;The only thing this experience has shown is just how out of touch with parents this Labour Government is.</p>
<p>&quot;The members of the school community who make up boards of trustees will always be in a better position to decide what&#39;s best for their students than will the Minister and his bureaucrats in Wellington,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
