<p>Electives crisis continues in Auckland</p>
<p>Latest figures show the chance of getting elective surgery in an Auckland hospital is worse now than six years ago, says National’s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>“Despite huge population growth in Auckland over the past six years, fewer and fewer Aucklanders are getting elective surgery. It’s a sad pattern repeated all around the country,” says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>“There’s 160,000 extra people with less chance they’ll get that operation they need.”</p>
<p>Figures from the Ministry of Health show that just 13,085 patients received elective surgery at Auckland DHB in the past year, compared to 14,003 in 2000/01.</p>
<p>At Counties Manukau, just 8,986 patients received elective surgery in the past year, compared with 10,666 in 2004/05. In 2000/01 the total was 9,835.</p>
<p>And at Waitemata DHB, just 5,722 patients received elective surgery in the past year, compared with 6,337 in 2004/05. In 2000/01 the total was 5,905.</p>
<p>In total, 11 of the country’s 21 DHBs carried out fewer elective operations this year then last year.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s a human price to this crisis, and the Government should start caring about the patients suffering at home,” says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>“Despite billions of dollars extra, the Government has failed to make any real inroads into boosting elective surgery over the past six years.</p>
<p>“Thousands of patients around the country have been culled from waiting lists, only to find they need to get even sicker to get an operation.</p>
<p>“Skimping on electives is false economy. The consequence of neglected elective surgery is that patients often develop chronic conditions that end up costing a lot more to fix.</p>
<p>“Doctors have the skills and knowledge to make life enjoyable again for so many more people. But the Government can’t organise the health system to make this happen.</p>
<p>&quot;National says elective surgery could be boosted by smart use of the private sector, greater involvement of specialists and GPs in decision-making, cuts to bureaucracy, and moving resources into services through a greater focus on value for money.”</p>
