<p>Labour school qualification figures fraudulent</p>
<p>Figures released last week on the proportion of young New Zealanders leaving school without qualifications are fraudulent, says National Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>“Under Labour, students have to gain only 20% of the equivalent of School Certificate to be counted as gaining a qualification.</p>
<p>“Labour claims only 13% of school leavers leave without a qualification. However their definition of a qualification is 13 or more credits at any level of NCEA.</p>
<p>“In fact students have to gain 80 credits to achieve the basic school qualification NCEA level One – which is equivalent to School Certificate.</p>
<p>“Twenty seven percent of students leave secondary school without Level One NCEA.</p>
<p>“So Labour is counting thousands of students who fail Level One as successes. A student with only 13 credits does not have a qualification. They need 80 credits.</p>
<p>“This is another example of Labour dropping standards to hide failure.</p>
<p>“Only those students who get the qualification should count.</p>
<p>“The reality is 27% of students leaving school have nothing to show for it, about the same proportion who fail the national standard for literacy.”</p>
