<p>Maharey in denial over school leavers&#39; stats</p>
<p>Education Minister Steve Maharey is in denial of the facts surrounding NCEA failure rates as presented by his own ministry, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey&#39;s claim that just 13% of students leave school without a qualification is nonsense. &quot;All the facts I have used to dispute his claim come straight from the Ministry of Education&#39;s own website.</p>
<p>&quot;The facts are clear:</p>
<p>o 27% of students leaving school in 2005 had not achieved NCEA level 1</p>
<p>o This is up from 20% in 2004.</p>
<p>o 44% of students leaving low-decile (1-3) schools do not have NCEA level 1</p>
<p>o 16% of students leaving high-decile (8-10) schools do not have NCEA level 1 &quot;Mr Maharey has walked away from thousands of young people who were promised a better future under NCEA but have now ended up failing,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
