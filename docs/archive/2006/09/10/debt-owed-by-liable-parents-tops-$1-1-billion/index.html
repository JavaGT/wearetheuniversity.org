<p>Judith Collins<br>National Party Welfare Spokeswoman</p>
<p>10 September 2006</p>
<p>Debt owed by liable parents tops $1.1 billion</p>
<p>The amount of debt owed by liable parents has topped the $1.1 billion mark, according to figures supplied to National’s Welfare spokeswoman, Judith Collins.</p>
<p>The figures show that at June 30, 140,365 liable parents owed $452,012,960 in child support arrears and $651,519,334 in penalty payments. This compared with 131,241 liable parents owing $192,452,098 in arrears and $188,292,302 in penalties in 2000, after Labour’s first year in office.</p>
<p>“These figures are absolutely astounding and prove yet again that Labour is making no headway whatsoever in recovering money owed by liable parents,” says Ms Collins.</p>
<p>“The amount in arrears has more than doubled and the total amount owed, including penalty, has almost tripled, from $380,744,400 to $1,103,532,294, since Labour came to power, despite promise after promise after promise that they would try harder to collect the outstanding debts.</p>
<p>“The only answer they have is to let these people write off their penalties.</p>
<p>“Well, that is not good enough.</p>
<p>“They are letting these people accumulate huge debt while leaving the taxpayer to pick up the tab.</p>
<p>“They are rewarding bad behaviour, pure and simple.</p>
<p>“Nearly half a billion dollars in arrears is huge money which could help make a real difference to thousands of children and their families.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is doing single parents and their children a grave disservice by failing to enforce the law,&quot; says Ms Collins.</p>
<p>&quot;This money must be collected and returned to the pockets of hard-working New Zealand taxpayers, but all Labour can do is refuse to admit there is a major problem.”</p>
