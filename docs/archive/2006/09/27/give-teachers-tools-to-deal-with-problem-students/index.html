<p><strong>Wednesday, 27 September 2006, 8:36 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Give teachers tools to deal with problem students</p>
<p>Teachers need more options for dealing with badly behaved students says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>He is commenting on reports from teachers today that they are now routinely dealing with violence in secondary school classrooms.</p>
<p>“The philosophy of inclusion dictates every student has to be in the classroom all the time, but it simply doesn’t work when student behaviour becomes extremely disruptive.</p>
<p>“Our society can&#39;t, and shouldn’t, expect teachers to deal with threatening knife wielding students.”</p>
<p>Mr English says research has shown that bad behaviour is the main reason teachers leave the profession early and disruptive behaviour in the classroom has been shown to have a negative impact on their classmates’ learning.</p>
<p>“Every school has to set standards for behaviour, but when that behaviour becomes extreme, schools need more options for dealing with problem students.</p>
<p>“Teachers deserve support from a community which takes responsibility for social issues and delivers teachers better tools for dealing with badly behaved students,” says Mr English.</p>
