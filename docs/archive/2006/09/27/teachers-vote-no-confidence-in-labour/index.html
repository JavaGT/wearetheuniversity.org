<p>Bill English MP<br>National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>27 September 2006</p>
<p>Teachers vote no confidence in Labour</p>
<p>“Teachers at the PPTA conference have effectively delivered a vote of no confidence in Labour’s handling of the NCEA debacle and Steve Maharey’s management,” says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>“Five years down the track, teachers at the conference are still saying there’s a long way to go before the bugs in NCEA are ironed out. That’s simply not good enough for students, and it won’t be good enough for their parents, either.”</p>
<p>The conference was discussing a recent poll of PPTA members which found about a third of teachers supported NCEA, one third did not, and the remainder still had concerns.</p>
<p>“Teachers have legitimate concerns about whether the external exams are reliable and fair, whether the internal assessment has integrity, and the effect of the credit system on student motivation.</p>
<p>“This is a crisis of confidence in one of our most important qualifications. Parents will be very worried, and they should voice that alarm to the Minister.”</p>
<p>Mr English says Labour has been in total denial about NCEA’s flaws.</p>
<p>“When the majority of teachers are unsure about whether NCEA is working properly some five years after its introduction, Mr Maharey needs to act with urgency.</p>
<p>“Instead of continually defending the obvious and numerous failures, he should be fixing them.</p>
<p>“That’s clearly the message teachers are sending and that’s the message parents should repeat.</p>
<p>“Many of the problems teachers raise can be solved, but the teachers I speak with are frustrated because their concerns continue to be ignored,” says Mr English.</p>
