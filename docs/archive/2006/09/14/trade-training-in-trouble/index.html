<p>Trade training in trouble</p>
<p>National MP Colin King says there is no hope of solving the skills shortage when so many students don&#39;t even have the option of skills training. He is referring to figures released by National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English, which show that almost 16,000 students left school last year without achieving NCEA level 1 - the equivalent of the old School Certificate.</p>
<p>&quot;This is having a huge impact on trade and skills training at a time when we face the worst skill shortage in a quarter of a century,&quot; says Mr King, who has responsibility for trade training.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be very hard to solve the nationwide skills shortage when so many young people entering the workforce don&#39;t even hold the basic qualification that the vast majority of trade and skills courses require as a prerequisite for enrolment.</p>
<p>&quot;Without NCEA level 1, school leavers who want to go on to further training have to trump up with $3,000 to $4,000 for a TOPS course to gain the basic reading and writing skills they should have learnt at school. &quot;It is totally unacceptable that so many young New Zealanders are being let down by the education system, leaving them with very few options. &quot;The best efforts of regional development agencies and local businesses to resolve the skills shortage won&#39;t succeed while so many young people aren&#39;t even making it to the starting line.</p>
<p>&quot;Until the literacy and numeracy crisis in our schools is put to bed, the transformation of our economy will remain nothing but a forlorn dream,&quot; says Mr King.</p>
