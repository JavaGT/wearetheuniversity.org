<p>OECD Report Confirms NZ’s High Fees</p>
<p>A report released by the OECD highlights New Zealand’s incredibly high tuition fees noted the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).</p>
<p>“This report shows just how high New Zealand’s tertiary tuition fees are,” said Conor Roberts, Co-president of NZUSA.</p>
<p>“When the OECD compared us with other countries, it highlighted our high fees and comparably low levels of government funding of tertiary education.”</p>
<p>“Whilst New Zealand has a high level of participation in tertiary, we also have a high drop out rate. Participation is not good enough, students need to be supported to achieve in Tertiary Education.”</p>
<p>“Charging students such high fees makes it hard for students to stay in study and that is part of the reason for our high drop out rate.”</p>
<p>“We call upon the Government to immediately increase its contribution to public tertiary education in order to fund the tertiary education system that New Zealand needs.”</p>
<p>“It is no surprise that those countries with high public funding of tertiary education and low fees, have a high GDP and low drop out rates. An adequately funded Tertiary Education system is important for our economic and social future,” concluded Mr Roberts.</p>
