<p>AUS Condemns University Ban on Supermarket Petition</p>
<p>The Canterbury Branch of the Association of University Staff has condemned an order from university management to remove an online petition supporting locked-out supermarket workers.</p>
<p>The petition was gathering names of university employees to add to a statement declaring that they would boycott all Countdown, Woolworths, Fresh Choice, Supervalue and Foodtown supermarkets in protest against the management lock-out of workers.</p>
<p>The AUS at Canterbury, who last week made a $1000 donation to the affected families, said that the petition gave people at the university a practical way to contribute to the well-being of the wider community.</p>
<p>&quot;The affected workers are among the lowest paid and most vulnerable members of our community and I know there is overwhelming sympathy and support for them among my colleagues at the university&quot;, said Canterbury Branch President David Small.</p>
<p>Dr Small also pointed out that all New Zealand universities have a statutory obligation to act as &#39;critic and conscience of society&#39; which was consistent with this sort of community-spirited action. He challenged university management to cite a single example in the last year of a management initiative that was designed to fulfill that responsibility.</p>
<p>Dr Small said that freedom of expression, the open exchange of ideas and an engagement with the community were fundamental to the health of a university and that these were being threatened by management acting like the &#39;thought police&#39;.</p>
<p>A version of the petition that is not web-based attracted 136 signatures from staff in its first hour.</p>
