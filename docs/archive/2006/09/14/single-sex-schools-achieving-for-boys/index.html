<p>Single-sex schools achieving for boys</p>
<p>Ten per cent more boys attending single-sex schools leave with a qualification than their peers at co-ed schools, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education figures show that while 31% of all boys leave school with no qualification, just 21% of boys at boys&#39; schools leave with nothing.</p>
<p>Only 14% of girls attending single-sex schools leave without a qualification, compared with 24% of all girls.</p>
<p>&quot;These figures show that it is worth investigating the culture and teaching practices at single-sex schools to gain a better understanding of what&#39;s working,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;The disparity in achievement levels between students at single-sex schools and students at co-ed schools may be related to the fact that single-sex schools tend to be higher decile.&quot;</p>
<p>Just 16% of students leaving high-decile (8-10) schools leave without NCEA level 1, compared to a staggering 44% from low-decile (1-3) schools.</p>
<p>&quot;But, whatever the reason, the difference between boys&#39; and girls&#39; success is significant and cannot continue to be swept under the carpet,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
