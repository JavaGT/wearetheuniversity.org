<p>Students Appear in Front of Select Committee</p>
<p>Students will be appearing in front of the Transport and Industrial Relations Select Committee this morning to speak against National MP Wayne Mapp’s Employment Relations (Probationary Employment) Amendment Bill</p>
<p>“Students will be appearing in front of the select committee to argue against the introduction of the 90 days with no rights at work bill,” said Conor Roberts, Co-president of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.</p>
<p>“Students can see that they are going to get done over by this bill and will be highlighting the negative consequences of giving employees no rights when they start work.”</p>
<p>“Many thousands of students finish studying at the end of November then go out and get a job for the summer, starting back at University or Polytechnic again at the end of February. This bill would mean that for that three month period they would have no rights at work.”</p>
<p>“Students need stable employment during that period in order to save up for the high costs of tertiary education the following year, however National’s bill would strip them of the proper rights at work that New Zealanders currently take for granted and leave them open to exploitation.”</p>
<p>“We will be encouraging the select committee to recommend that this bill does not proceed because of the many negative consequences for student employment that will follow if it passes,” concluded Mr Roberts.</p>
