<p><strong>Wednesday, 25 January 2006, 1:34 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions">New Zealand Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p>$12 min wage needed sooner rather than later</p>
<p>The Council of Trade Unions will be campaigning for public support in 2006 for the speedier introduction of a $12 minimum wage for all workers.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Unite Union community panel in Auckland today, CTU President Ross Wilson said the CTU joined with other concerned community representatives in calling for a minimum wage increase now, and an end to youth rates.</p>
<p>&quot;A $12 minimum wage is totally justifiable on both equity and economic development grounds,&quot; said Ross Wilson. &quot;The CTU wants the government to phase in a minimum wage of two thirds of the average adult wage, as recommended by the International Labour Organisation, and we see an increase to $12 now as a step in that direction.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The CTU also supports the removal of the age differential for the minimum wage by scrapping youth rates. We support fair pay for a fair day&#39;s work, and we look forward to campaigning alongside other community groups this year for the abolishment of youth rates and a speedier increase in the minimum wage to $12 per hour,&quot; said Ross Wilson.</p>
<p>&quot;Poverty only exists in New Zealand as long as we continue to tolerate it. The low wages that far too many New Zealand workers are paid has a direct impact on thousands of poor families, and contributes to our unacceptable rates of child poverty. Action is needed now on New Zealand&#39;s low wage crisis, and an immediate increase in the minimum wage would make a real difference to many low paid workers,&quot; said Ross Wilson.</p>
