<p>Using Exercise To Counteract Depression In Older People</p>
<p>The potential benefits of regular activity for nearly 200 older people with depression are to be tested in a University of Auckland study that begins this month.</p>
<p>Principal investigator Dr Ngaire Kerse from the University&#39;s School of Population Health said there is a link between levels of disability and depression in older people.</p>
<p>&quot;It becomes a depression cycle. Disability levels lead to depression, and depression leads to disability, creating a downward spiral for older people.</p>
<p>&quot;We know physical activity and exercise programmes benefit individual health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes, as well as improving the overall quality of life, and reducing falls.</p>
<p>&quot;There is also growing evidence that regular exercise helps to improve a person&#39;s mood.</p>
<p>&quot;My fellow researchers and I want to evaluate the impact of a home-based activity programme that also involves a level of social participation. We will examine how it affects quality of life, the way people function day to day, and depressive symptoms,&quot; said Dr Kerse.</p>
<p>The randomised study will recruit participants through large general practices in the Auckland region. Seriously ill or suicidal patients will not be included.</p>
<p>Participants in the intervention group will be visited at home by a trained nurse and instructed in an acceptable home based activity programme that will include goal setting, progressive resistance training and walking</p>

<p>Those in the control group will receive social visits from a person interested in issues for older people.</p>
<p>Dr Kerse said if the study shows that exercise has a positive impact, the findings will be significant for the future management of health issues among older people with depression.</p>
<p>&quot;If a person&#39;s ability to function and their quality of life improve as a result of daily exercise, then we would also expect a decline in the impact of depression on overall health status, and reduced demand for health care.&quot;</p>
<p>General practitioners in the Auckland region interested in finding out more about this study can contact Dr Ngaire Kerse on 09 373 7599, extension 84467.</p>
<p>The study is funded by a New Zealand Health Research Council grant.</p>
