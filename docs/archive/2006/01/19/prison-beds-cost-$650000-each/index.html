<p>Simon Power<br>National Party Law &amp; Order Spokesman</p>
<p>19 January 2006</p>
<p>Prison beds cost $650,000 each</p>
<p>National&#39;s Law &amp; Order spokesman, Simon Power, says the construction budget blow-out at Otago and Springhill prisons has pushed the cost per bed into the stratosphere.</p>
<p>- The original cost per bed at the 335-bed Otago (Milburn) prison was $462,000, based on the original cost of $155 million. That has spiralled to $650,000, based on the latest Government costing of the prison of $218 million.</p>
<p>- The original cost of a bed at the 650-bed Springhill prison was $283,000, based on the original construction cost of $184 million. That has more than doubled to $585,000 per bed, based on the latest cost of $380 million.</p>
<p>&quot;These figures speak for themselves,&quot; says Mr Power.</p>
<p>&quot;You could buy a very good house in both these areas for the cost of one cell. Real Estate Institute figures show the median house price in the Springhill area is $195,000 and in the Milburn area $130,000.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s rich of Damien O&#39;Connor to blame the blow-out on higher costs of materials and labour when Cabinet papers quoted by the NZ Herald show that half of the extra money needed for Springhill - $50 million - is due to &#39;omissions from previous estimates&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;It is also very concerning that he is now allowing Corrections to use cash earmarked for other projects, such as maintenance at Mt Eden, to cover the increased construction costs.</p>
<p>&quot;He must assure the public that deferring such projects will not compromise security at our prisons.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a shambles of the highest order.&quot;</p>
