<p><strong>Thursday, 26 January 2006, 2:46 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>26 January 2006</p>
<p>John Key MP</p>
<p>National Party Finance Spokesman</p>
<p>20,000 lost jobs a bodyblow to workers</p>
<p>Finance Minister Michael Cullen today put a number on the job losses the country can expect from the economic slowdown.</p>
<p>He told Holmes on radio this morning that about 20,000 people could lose their jobs from the slowdown this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Twenty thousand jobs lost is a huge price to pay for squandering the golden years,&quot; says National Finance spokesman John Key.</p>
<p>&quot;No wonder the Government is running around like headless chooks now they&#39;ve finally calculated just how many Kiwis will lose their jobs from the rapidly slowing economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government had the perfect opportunity over the past six years to build a more competitive economy. Instead they used the time to implement policies that only serve to make us less competitive and workers more vulnerable.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday&#39;s admission by Dr Cullen that any business tax reform is a long way off will send a chilling reminder to New Zealand workers that this Government has no solutions to a problem that could soon see as many as 20,000 of them pay with their jobs.&quot;</p>
