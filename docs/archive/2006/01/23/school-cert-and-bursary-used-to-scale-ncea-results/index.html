<p><strong>Monday, 23 January 2006, 12:53 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>School Cert and Bursary used to scale NCEA results</p>
<p>Education Minister Steve Maharey has admitted that old School Certificate and Bursary results have been used to scale this year’s NCEA marks, says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;Education authorities have for years criticised School Certificate and Bursary as out of date and unfair,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“Yet, in answers to Parliamentary questions the Minister of Education has revealed that old School Certificate and Bursary results have been used to scale this year’s NCEA marks.</p>
<p>“The answers showed that the old School Certificate and Bursary marks were used alongside analysis of past NCEA results and consultation with markers.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the clearest indication yet that Labour are backtracking to the old scaling system.</p>
<p>“It is also a promising indication that Steve Maharey and the extremists in the education bureaucracy are losing the battle over NCEA.</p>
<p>“National will keep fighting to preserve standards and to make sure students get the benefit of fair and consistent assessment,” says Mr English.</p>
