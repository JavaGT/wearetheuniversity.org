<p><strong>Green Party saddened by death of Nelson Mandela</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party expressed sadness at the passing today of Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>“Nelson Mandela’s life showed how one person’s struggle against the injustices of apartheid and colonisation made a difference,” said Green Party Co-leader Russel Norman.</p>
<p>“Despite Nelson Mandela’s imprisonment and ill treatment at the hands of the South African regime, he, more than anyone else, helped to move his country forward to a new era of democracy.</p>
<p>“Despite Nelson Mandela’s extraordinary achievements he was also a very humble man that readily acknowledged the part others inside and outside South Africa had played in apartheid’s overthrow.</p>
<p>“Our hearts go out to the thousands of others who played their part in the struggle that Nelson Mandela lead. Today will be a great day of sadness for all those who played their part in fighting against the iniquities of apartheid.</p>
<p>“Nelson Mandela was also an inspiration to indigenous people all around the world,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“Whenever visiting countries where indigenous peoples had suffered through colonisation, Nelson Mandela would make certain to highlight past wrongs and suggest ways forward.</p>
<p>“For many New Zealanders and especially Maori who had opposed the Springbok tour of 1981, Nelson Mandela was an inspirational figure.</p>
<p>“His efforts and life since leaving prison and becoming South Africa’s first democratic President have shown the world that justice is inevitable for all oppressed people,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“Nelson Mandela’s story will continue to give hope to all people who suffer under unjust regimes.”</p>
