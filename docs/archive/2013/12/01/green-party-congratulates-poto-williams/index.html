<p><strong>Green Party congratulates Poto Williams on Christchurch East by-election result</strong><br> <br>The Green Party is congratulating Poto Williams on her win in the Christchurch East by-election and says the result highlights a significant decline in support for National in Christchurch.<br> <br>&quot;I want to congratulate Poto on her win. She fought a good campaign and I wish her the best of luck representing the good people of Christchurch East,&quot; said Green Party Christchurch East candidate David Moorhouse.<br> <br>“I am really proud of the campaign we ran. I want to thank all the volunteers and supporters who got in behind it and made it such a success.<br> <br>“We increased our candidate vote from 4.7 percent at the last election to 7 percent tonight. That is a great improvement.<br> <br>“We proposed real solutions on important issues like housing and received a very positive response from the thousands of people we spoke to.<br> <br>“We developed a solid policy platform to fix the big problems in Christchurch. As a party we are in better shape now than going into the campaign.<br> <br>“Through this campaign we built a great team of volunteers. I thank them and appreciate their time and dedication,” said David Moorhouse.<br> <br>“The result highlights the decline in the National Party’s support in Christchurch. Before the by-election there was much talk of them taking out the seat, but in the end they were a long way off,” said Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman.<br> <br>“National’s support has plummeted. At the last election discredited former MP Aaron Gilmour achieved 35.8 percent of the candidate vote in Christchurch East. Tonight Matthew Doocey could only muster 26 percent of the vote. <br> <br>“Christchurch East electors have made sure that National did not increase their majority in Parliament and the result means that National will continue to have to rely on the discredited ACT and United<br>Future parties to govern,” said Dr Norman.<br> <br>ENDS</p>
