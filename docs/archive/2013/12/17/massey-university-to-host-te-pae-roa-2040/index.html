<p>Massey University to Host Te Pae Roa 2040: Hui Taumata 30 Years On and 30 Years Ahead</p>
<p>“I’m pleased to announce that Massey University will host Te Pae Roa 2040: Hui Taumata 30 Years On and 30 Years Ahead,” states Assistant Vice Chancellor Māori and Pasifika, Dr.Selwyn Katene.</p>
<p>“Next year marks 30 years since the inaugural Hui Taumata, held in 1984. From that time Māori development has accelerated, especially as many hapū and iwi embark on various post-settlement investments. Next year is therefore an opportune time to take stock of the path Māori development has taken and where that journey might head in the future as Aotearoa New Zealand moves towards the bicentennial celebrations of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi”.</p>
<p>“The Conference themes will explore the issues, challenges and opportunities facing Māori in the future including the desire to balance economic, social, cultural and environmental dimensions and the balance between current and future generations. Leading Māori thinkers and experts in the field will discuss and debate the themes identified.”</p>
<p>A Steering Committee, chaired by Emeritus Professor Sir Mason Durie has been established and further details will be published over the next few months.</p>
<p>“The Conference will be held at the Albany Campus of Massey University, Auckland, on September 2 - 3, 2014.</p>
<p>Te Pae Roa 2040 is an opportunity not to be missed and Massey University is pleased to be able to host the event.”</p>
