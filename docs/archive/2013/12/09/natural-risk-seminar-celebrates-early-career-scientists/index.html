<p><strong>Risk Interpretation and Action: Fellows seminar in New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>Early December 2013, 25 talented, early career scientists will come to New Zealand to develop new, interdisciplinary perspectives on the ways in which people interpret risks and how they respond based on these interpretations. During a week-long seminar, the 25 early career scientists will join a number of senior scientists, including David Johnston (Joint Centre for Disaster Research, Massey University, New Zealand) and Richard Eiser (University of Sheffield, United Kingdom), to explore if and how a recently published framework for response to natural hazards (Eiser et al 2012; <a href="http://bit.ly/116mM6k">http://bit.ly/116mM6k</a>) can be integrated across scientific disciplines and cultural contexts.</p>
<p>The seminar is co-sponsored by the World Social Science Fellows programme of the International Social Science Council (ISSC), the Risk Interpretation and Action working group of the Integrated Research on Disaster Risk (IRDR) programme, the IRDR International Center of Excellence, Taipei, the international START Secretariat, and the Royal Society of New Zealand. It will be hosted by Massey University in Wellington and University of Canterbury in Christchurch.</p>
<p>The 25 early career scientists come from all over the world and have been selected as so-called Fellows in a competitive process. The organising partners are proud to welcome them to their international networks and we expect they will bring exciting new perspectives on risk interpretation and action to the seminar. The Fellows are:</p>

<p><strong>Wendy SAUNDERS</strong></p>
<p>Land use planning is one tool available to manage natural hazards. Key to this is being able to interpret hazard information, translate that to risk, and on to policy. Dr Wendy Saunders&#39; research has involved developing a framework for decision makers that focuses on the consequences of natural hazard events (i.e. health and safety, economic, critical buildings, buildings, and social/cultural land uses), then the likelihood of an event occurring - rather than the primary focus being on likelihood. Consequences from insignificant to catastrophic are quantified and qualified. This assists decision makers in understanding and interpreting the risks, and to determine if they are acceptable, tolerable or intolerable.

Mr Schenk&#39;s research focuses on infrastructure-related planning and decision-making in the face of uncertain and dynamic climate change. He is working with stakeholders in Rotterdam, Singapore and New York to explore how they might effectively work across organizational, institutional and interest-based boundaries to mitigate climate-related risks and make robust decisions. He uses role-play simulation exercises extensively in both his research and consulting work to engage stakeholders and collaboratively explore issues.</p>
<p><strong>Fabiola SOSA-RODRIGUEZ</strong></p>
<p>Dr Fabiola Sos-Rodriguez is a teacher and researcher at the Autonomous Metropolitan University (UAM), Mexico. She was a postdoctoral researcher in the Faculty of Environment, University of Waterloo, Canada and obtained her PhD in Urban and Environmental Studies and Master’s degree in Urban Studies in El Colegio de Mexico, Mexico.</p>
<p>Dr Sosa-Rodriguez&#39;s research has been focused on analyzing the physical and the human components of risk in order to have a comprehensive knowledge of people’s exposure, perception and responses. She has worked with different types of risks, including water-related, climate and seismic in several countries, for example, Mexico, Canada, Venezuela and Ecuador.</p>
<p><strong>Victoria SWORD-DANIELS</strong></p>
<p>Dr Victoria Sword-Daniels is an interdisciplinary scientist, interested in the interface between natural hazards and social sciences in order to find ways of understanding and reducing risks faced by societies that are exposed to hazards. She is employed as a Knowledge Exchange Fellow on the Increasing Resilience to Natural Hazards (IRNH) consortia projects, jointly funded by the social and natural research councils in the UK (ESRC-NERC). Her fellowship aims to increase the impact of the IRNH research projects through collaboration, building interdisciplinary networks and by embedding research findings into policy and practice. Her PhD explored the complexities of living and working with extensive volcanic risk in Montserrat, West Indies.

<p><strong>Suzanne VALLANCE</strong></p>
<p>Dr Suzanne Vallance began teaching full-time at Lincoln University, New Zealand, in 2008 having completed her PhD on the topic of urban sustainability in New Zealand. Dr Vallance has a growing reputation as a human geographer with a particular interest in environmental/risk management and participatory planning/activism in urban areas. Through her own work and supervision, she has participated in debates about the meanings and practices associated with urban sustainability and resilience, and ways in which formal and informal planning approaches diverge (often with ‘perverse effects’). Through her work on gardens, sprawl, vacant spaces, seafood gathering, the commodification of community and civic expertise, she seeks a better understanding of people’s collective (human and non-human) attempts to shape the world in which they live, according to their needs, aspirations, and their awareness and framing of risk. The recent devastating earthquakes in Canterbury have added a distinct edge to her work in this area and she currently has Marsden Fast Start funding to compare and contrast the contingent planning strategies associated with various ‘emergent’ and ‘insurgent’ publics and community-led planning networks.</p>
<p><strong>Xinlu XIE</strong></p>
<p>Dr Xinlu Xie is interested in sustainable urbanization and the influences of urbanization on risks and disasters, especially the vulnerability and adaptation of climate change. She currently works on risk perception of urban residents since urban disaster risks and losses are rising because of activities of unplanned land use, lacking of public participation, lacking of insurances and such.</p>
<p>Dr Xie graduated from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) with a Ph.D. in economics in 2011. She has worked on climate change risks and adaptation at the <em>Institute for Urban &amp; Environmental Studies</em> of <em>CASS</em> (IUE-CASS) for two years. She also works with natural scientists on disaster data sharing which needs cooperation with social scientists. She has studied the vulnerability and adaptation of Beijing after the 721 rainstorm in 2012 together with her colleagues.</p>
