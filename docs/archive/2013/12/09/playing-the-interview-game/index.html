<p><strong>Playing the interview game</strong></p>
<p>Victoria University graduand Ewa Kusmierczyk has discovered the key to success in job interviews—and it&#39;s more than just what you say, or how you say it.</p>
<p>She says it’s all about the small things which help to develop trust between the interviewer and the candidate, and which are often taken for granted.</p>
<p>Ewa, who will graduate next week with a PhD in Applied Linguistics, studied 18 recorded interviews in minute detail, observing how speech, gaze, gesture, and documents are used to negotiate a shared understanding of what is required as an answer. This process, she says, relies on using multiple channels of communication.</p>
<p>“The candidate has limited time to pick up on the signals, and any misinterpretation can be taken as a reflection of incompetence.”</p>
<p>For example, when an interviewer points to a candidate&#39;s CV while asking a question, this is likely to be a signal that specific information or a specific example is expected.</p>
<p>The candidate will meet this expectation if they make a direct reference to a particular experience in the CV.</p>
<p>Ewa says actions that accompany speech, such as gesture, have an important role to play, especially when things are not going well.</p>
<p>“Gestures can carry information that is not expressed in speech. Mimicking the other person’s gestures and speech in particular helps link the interpretations and create a feeling of understanding.</p>
<p>“Because the interviewer typically holds the power, some candidates can feel at a disadvantage. This is particularly relevant where skilled migrants, and especially non-native speakers, are competing against New Zealanders.”</p>

<p>Ewa gathered data from mock interviews with graduate students and by working with an international recruitment agency which allowed her to video real interviews.</p>
<p>In addition to showing her how trust is built up, close to 30 hours of data uncovered a feature relevant to interviews in New Zealand—the so-called “tall poppy syndrome”.</p>
<p>“Candidates are obviously expected to present themselves as positively as they can but there is an implicit expectation that they will soften their self-promotion,” says Ewa.</p>
<p>Softening strategies include humorous comments, story-telling, or using intonation, gaze and gesture to engage the interviewer.</p>
<p>Ewa is putting her knowledge into practice by working for NZUniCareerHub—an initiative involving career services at seven New Zealand universities which matches graduates and employers.</p>
<p>Longer term she hopes to find work helping organisations to look at the way they think about, and approach, interviews. “Bad employment choice is a costly business,” she says.</p>
<p>Ewa graduates with a PhD in Applied Linguistics on Thursday 12 December at 1.30pm.</p>
