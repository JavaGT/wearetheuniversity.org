<p><strong>Wednesday, 11 December 2013, 5:03 pm</strong><br><strong>Speech: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong><br>New Zealand First Leader<br>11 December 2013  </p>
<p><strong>Adjournment Debate Speech<br>Wednesday 11 December 2013</strong><br><strong>Parliament Buildings</strong></p>
<p>On behalf of New Zealand First we want to thank all of the many people who make Parliament function effectively</p>
<p>Their commitment, integrity, and professionalism ensure that the New Zealand Parliament runs in a smooth way.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people to acknowledge - the Speaker’s office, the Clerk’s Office, the Hansard reporters, all the library staff, and the telephonists.</p>
<p>We appreciate the cheerful messengers and security staff for their hard work in keeping us all safe (and under control)</p>
<p>And, of course the cleaners. They deserve a special thanks—and a pay rise.</p>
<p>And if we have overlooked anybody, our apologies.</p>
<p>We want to acknowledge the support and dedication of NZ First staff who have helped make us such an effective team in serving the public .</p>
<p>However it’s harder to be kind to the people over there who are doing a runner after spending another year wrecking the place.</p>
<p>They don’t want to face scrutiny for a nano-second longer.</p>
<p>It’s been a great year for their cronies but more kicks in the teeth for ordinary people.</p>
<p>Never before in the history of human endeavour has so little been done for so many - for the benefit of so few.</p>
<p>Let’s list some of those non-achievers non-achievements:</p>
<p>• The dream of owning your own home – Just about gone<br>• High performing state assets like power stations – just about gone<br>• Public broadcasting – just about gone<br>• Job opportunities for young – just about gone<br>• Our manufacturing industry – just about gone.<br>• Our best dairying farmland – just about gone.<br>• The foreshore and seabed – just about gone<br>• The member for Epsom – just about gone – to court first<br>• The leaker for Ohariu – he’s just about gone<br>• The member for Warner brothers, Sky City, Rio Tinto – just about gone – following his memory which was gone a long time ago.<br>• Our friends in the Maori Party – just about gone<br>• In fact this is the most “just about gone” government in history.<br>Somebody should have told “the just about gone” brigade they don’t actually own New Zealand.</p>

<p>This country is not “The National Party and Limpets Limited”.</p>
<p>It actually belongs to the people and the leaders are supposed to be guardians.</p>
<p>This lot guard only their mates pockets and foreign companies.</p>
<p>Ordinary kiwis are not considered.</p>
<p>This country is losing jobs at an alarming rate – so what do the political pygmies do?</p>
<p>Give what jobs there are to foreigners.</p>
<p>What about bringing in tens of thousands of foreign students to study here – then giving them work visas!</p>
<p>How dumb is that!</p>
<p>And what about giving Full New Zealand pensions to people who have been here only ten years?</p>
<p>What other country has a leadership this stupid?<br>The ghost of Ebeneezer Scrooge stalks the corridors of the callous.</p>
<p>This Government has brought ordinary Kiwis no Xmas Cheer and the Scrooges will have no change of heart.</p>
<p>We in New Zealand First try to bring a message of hope – that this country can be a better place.</p>
<p>There are some of us who remember that New Zealand once tried to be fair and to look after its people – especially the young and the old.</p>
<p>Let me assure you we will be back fresher, faster, fearless and more ferocious next year to hold the government to account.</p>
<p>This is a fair warning.</p>
<p>But finally let me say New Zealand First is the party of traditional values.</p>
<p>We wish all New Zealanders a Happy Xmas and a very good New Year!</p>
