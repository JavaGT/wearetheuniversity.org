<p>Lab launch marks New Zealand first</p>
<p>New Zealand’s first cyber security lab will be opened at the University of Waikato on Tuesday, coinciding with the launch of a new qualification, the Master of Cyber Security degree.</p>
<p>The lab, dubbed CROW (Cyber Security Researchers of Waikato), will focus on returning control of data to data owners by focussing on research addressing data security from a user-centric perspective. It will develop innovative solutions to allow users to know what happens to their data, particularly when it is stored in a cloud environment.</p>
<p>With the increasing dependence on information technology and the global rise of cyber security threats, the launch addresses a growing need to train skilled and ethical cyber security professionals and develop new technology to protect New Zealand&#39;s critical infrastructure and economies.</p>
<p>The lab has a large-scale cloud computing test bed for realistic testing and verification of its tools and senior lecturer Dr Ryan Ko says it will run along six themes: provenance; user-centricity; security visualisation; security economics; hardware security and tools and datasets.</p>
<p>It will also contribute to teaching New Zealand’s first Master of Cyber Security degree, subject to approval by Universities New Zealand CUAP (Committee on University Academic Programmes).</p>
<p>Dr Ko says while many people study computer science and software development, there is a growing need for more cyber security specialists.</p>

<p>“I think, especially in New Zealand, there is a lack of mainstream education on cyber security so our aim is to train ethical security professionals. There is a lack of such training at university level.”</p>
<p>Data privacy and accountability are new areas of research and study which will grow over time and cyber security experts were highly sought after, Dr Ko says.</p>
<p>“Data security education is still a fledgling area and a good area for the University to get into early. We want to be one of the top cyber security regional hubs in the Asia/Pacific region in five years.”</p>
<p>Dr Ko is an acknowledged expert in cloud computing security and last year received the Ron Knode Service Award for his volunteer work with the not-for-profit Cloud Security Alliance (CSA). He has been involved in cloud computing from the earliest days, working for HP&#39;s Cloud and Security Lab from 2010 to 2012, volunteered as a research director for the Singapore chapter of the CSA and is founder of the CSA Cloud Data Governance Working Group.</p>
<p>The launch will take place on Tuesday, 3 December at 4pm at F-G Link at the University of Waikato.</p>
