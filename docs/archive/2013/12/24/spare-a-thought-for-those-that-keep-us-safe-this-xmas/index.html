<p>Jacinda Ardern<br>Police and Corrections Spokesperson</p>

<p><strong>Spare a thought for those that keep us safe this Xmas</strong></p>
<p>This Christmas we should spare a thought for those who work tirelessly to keep us safe, including police officers and prison staff, says Labour’s Police and Corrections spokesperson Jacinda Ardern.</p>
<p>“Thousands of Corrections Department workers and Police will put on a uniform at Christmas and do what they do everyday – try to make a difference within our justice system.</p>
<p>“I am constantly impressed by the people I meet working within our prisons. They are there because they believe they can make a difference to people’s lives.</p>
<p>“It is a tough job though. While the Minister of Corrections has set herself a target to reduce the number of assaults against prisons staff by 50 per cent, the reality is that incidents have increased by much more than that in just the past few years.</p>
<p>“Prison officers and police are amongst those who treat Christmas like any other work day.</p>
<p>“My father was a police officer and I remember plenty of Christmases at my house where we would all patiently wait for dad to come home from his shift before celebrations could start. When you’re little you don’t understand it, but it’s a reality for thousands of uniformed staff out there. I want to thank them for that,” Jacinda Ardern says.</p>
