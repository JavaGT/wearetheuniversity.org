<p><strong>UC student and Games contender seeking to break the two minute barrier</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>December 23, 2013</strong></p>
<p>University of Canterbury (UC) student and top New Zealand middle distance runner Angela Smit wants to run a personal best time and break the two minute barrier for the 800 metres during the New Zealand domestic season this summer.</p>
<p>Smit recently returned from training in the UK after competing earlier in the world championships at Moscow.</p>
<p>She ran her fastest time for the 800m (2m 00.03s) at the World University Games in Kazan four months ago and qualified for the world championships: See her race here:<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hnJM7ZjDtc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hnJM7ZjDtc</a>.</p>
<p>``I am semi-peaking for the bigger races in New Zealand and Australia in March, so that would be good time to have a crack at a fast time. Otherwise, I would definitely love to try and break the two minute mark in one of my targeted races leading up to the Commonwealth Games.’’</p>
<p>Smit has received a performance grant from Sport New Zealand for being ranked among the top 16 athletes in the world over her favoured distance.</p>
<p>She is already gearing her training toward the national championships to be held in Wellington on March 28 to 30.</p>
<p>``As well as the nationals, I plan to run in the Australian championships, the Sydney Classic, the Sylvia Potts Classic, the International Track Meet and some races in Europe.</p>
<p>``I really hope to get into some World Diamond League events again and race in some of the bigger meets around Europe and the UK before the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in July.</p>

<p>``I’m so excited about the season ahead and it’s not unrealistic to think of a medal for Glasgow. It will be really tough, but winning a medal is my goal. My first goal is to make the 800m final and then I would love to win a medal for New Zealand.</p>
<p>``I will return to UC next year as a student. I love the balance between studying and training or racing. I am excited about UC’s future. It is like no other university, especially after the Government gave UC $260 million toward its $1.1 billion rebuild programme.</p>
<p>``UC is already such a great place to study and grow. For me, running with great support from the Uni and the UC Sport programme really helps. The extra $260 million will make UC even more desirable, which is very exciting.</p>
<p>``I was born in this beautiful city, grew up here and I travel a lot for my running, but there is something extra special about Christchurch and Canterbury. I love this place, and there is nowhere quite like New Zealand.</p>
<p>``It is very exciting to think what the city will be like even in five years’ time.</p>
<p>``I am studying towards a Bachelor of Arts in education and psychology and there are so many interesting courses to take. The location is awesome. It is so close to everything. The staff are very helpful.</p>
<p>``There are lots of nice places to study and meet with friends on campus and, really importantly for me, is the sport set up which is great with an awesome UC Sport programme.’’</p>
