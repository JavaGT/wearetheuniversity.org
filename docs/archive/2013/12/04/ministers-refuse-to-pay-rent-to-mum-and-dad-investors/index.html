<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters<br>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>4 December 2013</p>
<p><strong>Ministers Refuse To Pay Rent to “Mum and Dad” Investors</strong></p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters says the Government is acting like a shonky finance company by refusing to pay a debt racked up by the government-owned company Learning Media.</p>
<p>When Learning Media was winding up, it paid a creditor (Westpac) by the Government pumping about five million dollars into it by using share offers. However it has not paid the rental on the building Learning Media occupied – a building owned by Kiwi investors.</p>
<p>Mr Peters today asked the Education Minister why she was allowing Learning Media to welch on a debt.</p>
<p>“The Government made sure there was enough money to pay a foreign bank and its mates but as usual Kiwis are getting their noses rubbed in the dirt.</p>
<p>“It is absolutely appalling that two Ministers – of Education and Finance – could allow a state owned company to default on money it owes through a legitimate government transaction.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says the Government has offered the building’s owners a pittance on a “take it or leave it” basis and he says this is simply not acceptable.</p>
<p>“Remember how the Government paid its mates who invested in South Canterbury Finance nearly $1.6 billion dollars when the company went under?</p>
<p>“For the sake of little over a million dollars the Ministers should try to restore some credibility and pay the rent incurred by Learning Media,” says Mr Peters.</p>
