<p><strong>Latest OECD findings point to major failure of government education policies</strong></p>
<p>The big drop in New Zealand’s student achievement in recent years is a direct result of a failure of this government’s education, economic and social policies, says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President Judith Nowotarski.</p>
<p>Mrs Nowotarski says the results are a clear wake up call to the government.</p>
<p>She says the Minister of Education has overseen one of the biggest drops in our student ranking in recent years.</p>
<p>The OECD PISA results, measuring 15 year old student achievement in science, maths and reading, shows that since 2008 New Zealand has had one of the fastest-growing rates of inequity as well as a corresponding decrease in student performance.</p>
<p>“Across the board New Zealand’s performance has dropped on all the scores and this is something that the government should be ashamed of. It shows its policies are nothing short of disastrous.”</p>
<p>“For five years the government has been obsessed with collecting unnecessary and irrelevant data when it should have been focussed on making a difference for students.</p>
<p>“The Minister is being misleading when she claims that this decline is a long-running trend. By far the biggest drop in achievement has occurred since 2009.</p>
<p>“This government’s obsession with data combined with no solutions for failing education policies has been a disaster for many New Zealand children. Instead of working with teachers and schools to improve education, the government has been hell-bent on dismantling our public education system.</p>

<p>“Countries that have a higher level of equity also have better achievement outcomes for all students. Eighteen percent of New Zealand children now live in poverty and the student achievement gap reflects the impact that poverty has on students’ learning.</p>
<p>“All the findings are saying the same thing. It’s now time for the government to start to look at what really works in education.</p>
<p>“We need the government to work with teachers and schools to restore our education system to its previous top performing level instead of having one of the fastest levels of decline in the OECD.”</p>
