<p>AUT first New Zealand university to partner with ANZBC</p>
<p>AUT University and the ASEAN (Association of South East Asia Nations) New Zealand Business Council (ANZBC) announced a partnership last night at a formal reception held at AUT. This partnership is the first of its kind between a business council and a university in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“AUT promotes itself as ‘the university for the changing world’ and, certainly, the economic growth and vibrancy of the ASEAN region has been one of the key changes in our world over recent decades, so it is logical that AUT would seek to strengthen ties with ASEAN nations,” says AUT Vice Chancellor Derek McCormack.</p>
<p>The partnership sees AUT becoming a ‘gold’ sponsor of ANZBC. The partners will work together on several initiatives to enhance and expand the performance of AUT in ASEAN markets, and contribute to the enhancement of the profile of New Zealand in ASEAN education markets.</p>
<p>Alister Lawrence, Chairman of the New Zealand ASEAN Business Council says, “The partnership between AUT and the ASEAN NZ Business Council is not only important for the two organisations involved, but also for New Zealand. It will facilitate links between a fine academic institution in New Zealand with the business community of the ASEAN countries, and lead to further growth in the number of students achieving qualifications based around New Zealand learning systems, and hence the profile of New Zealand with future business and government leaders.”</p>

<p>AUT and ANZBC will co-operate on matters including, but not limited to:</p>
<p>· The AUT annual ASEAN strategy.</p>
<p>· The internationalisation of AUT.</p>
<p>· Independent and professional advisory services on Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam.</p>
<p>· The hosting of joint events on ASEAN topics.</p>
<p>· Further promoting New Zealand research and academics in the ASEAN markets.</p>
<p>AUT’s Pro Vice-Chancellor International Professor Nigel Hemmington says, “This important new partnership is central to AUT’s strategy to build long-term mutually beneficial relationships in the ASEAN region – not just to recruit students but also to work with education, business, industry and government.”</p>
<p>AUT’s ASEAN strategy is strategically aligned with the New Zealand Government and the NZ Inc ASEAN strategy promoting better connections, influence, integration and boosting our economic return from the region for AUT and indeed New Zealand.</p>
