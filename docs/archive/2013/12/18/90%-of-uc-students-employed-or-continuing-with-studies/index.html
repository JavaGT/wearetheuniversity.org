<p><strong>90 percent of UC students employed or continuing with studies, new survey shows</strong></p>
<p>December 18, 2013</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury (UC) is committed to producing graduate students who are fully suitable for employability.</p>
<p>UC’s latest graduate survey released today confirms this with 90 percent of graduates either employed or continuing with their studies, UC Student Services and Communications director Lynn McClelland says.</p>
<p>Of the 1034 graduates who were working full time, more than 85 percent indicated they were either working in their ideal employment or were stepping in the right direction. About 80 percent of this cohort reported that their current employment either met or exceeded their expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;Initial indications suggest UC will increase its number of students next year as the Canterbury recovery and rebuild takes shape.</p>
<p>&quot;The graduate survey result is an outstanding achievement for a University ranked among the top three percent in the world, according to the latest QS rankings.</p>
<p>&quot;A significant increase in jobs is expected in the region as the rebuild for the future steps up, which is an opportunity few cities in the world ever have.</p>
<p>&quot;UC has already spent $160 million this year as it revamps buildings on campus and we are expected to spent $1.1 billion on remediation over the next 10 years. UC is a key part of the rebuild and as our student numbers begin to grow we enter an exciting phase of the post-quake process.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of opportunity for graduates and students to take an active part in shaping the city’s future. Christchurch is destined to be the most exciting city in Australasia for the next decade,&quot; McClelland says.</p>
<p>The survey looked at 2012 graduates about six months after leaving the university to gain a better understanding of employment patterns and occupations and to identify areas where the university could better prepare graduates for their careers and further education. A total of 78 percent of graduates from the field of technology and engineering were employed full-time.</p>
