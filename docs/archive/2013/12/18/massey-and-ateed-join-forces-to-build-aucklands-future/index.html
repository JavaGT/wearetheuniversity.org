<p><strong>Wednesday, December 18, 2013</strong><br><strong>Massey and ATEED join forces to build Auckland’s future</strong></p>
<p>Massey University and Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development (ATEED) are joining forces to help build the Auckland region through social, economic and community research and development.</p>
<p>A memorandum of understanding signed today by Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey and ATEED chief executive Brett O’Riley covers a range of programmes and will look at developing the Albany campus as an innovation hub for the North Shore.</p>
<p>Mr Maharey says the region is ready for a centre to consolidate innovative ideas. “We want to have the Albany campus seen as the focal point for Auckland North innovation – bringing business and local government here – and we’re impatient to get on with our building strategy. We think it will be a real game changer for the region to have a facility that was built specifically for the movement of ideas – from idea to practical delivery.”</p>
<p>With the Albany campus celebrating its 21st anniversary in 2014, alongside the 50th anniversary of Massey becoming a university, the agreement highlights the coming of age of the Albany campus and its ability to help drive growth regionally and nationally.</p>
<p>Mr O’Riley says the formal relationship is a great fit for ATEED’s economic growth priorities on behalf of the Auckland Council: “Massey University is one of Auckland’s world-class tertiary institutions, and the memorandum reflects ATEED’s principle of long-term collaboration.”</p>

<p>The university already has an agreement with Auckland Council under the Auckland Knowledge Exchange Hub umbrella, with Massey and council researchers working on projects involving identifying ethnic precincts in Auckland.</p>
<p>Mr O’Riley says ATEED will welcome the university’s important contribution to two of its priority actions for Auckland – using targeted research to grow the city’s level of innovation, and developing highly skilled graduates who will help to improve the region’s workforce capability.</p>
<p>“ATEED’s North area office has already developed a positive relationship with the university’s ecentre, which is doing great things in the ICT space – one of Auckland’s priority industries. The university is part of the Albany-Takapuna nexus, which is the northern gateway to Auckland’s strengthening innovation corridor, which runs south to Auckland Airport,” he says.</p>
<p>The regional development strategy matches Massey University’s vision for the campus and its contribution to the region, Mr Maharey says. “We really do want to be the hub of innovation, and we are keen to be seen as the driving force of Auckland North, with a real focus on being an academic institution of world standing in this innovation area that we know is what the country wants, and what countries around the world want.”</p>
