<p><strong>Sunday, 8 December 2013, 8:06 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party">The Maori Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>MEDIA STATEMENT</strong><br><strong>Maori Party</strong><br><strong>8 December 2013</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris McKenzie to run for Te Tai Hauauru</strong></p>
<p>“He’s smart beyond his years, gets both our young and old people, loves our people and really wants to make a difference for them.”</p>
<p>That’s the endorsement Tariana Turia has given for Chris McKenzie who was today announced as the Maori Party candidate to run for the Tai Hauauru seat in next year’s general elections.</p>
<p>“Chris has proven he’s a fighter for the people of his iwi and now he’ll be able to share that quality with the people and iwi of Tai Hauauru,” says Mrs Turia, who has held the Tai Hauauru seat since 2002 and will retire next year.</p>
<p>“I know Chris will be mustering all the knowledge, skills, courage, energy and aroha he has for the people and iwi of Tai Hauauru to ensure he serves them well.</p>
<p>“Chris knows how our people work, how the system works and with him at the helm, I have no worries retiring because I know our people will be in good and capable hands,” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“A vote for Chris McKenzie is a vote to protect and grow what Tariana has fought so hard for – Whanau Ora, maintaining the Maori seats, addressing poverty as a collective responsibility and Maori training initiatives just to name a few,” said Maori Party president Naida Glavish.</p>
<p>Chris (Ngati Raukawa, Waikato-Tainui) is a political strategist with a senior management, small business governance and iwi leadership background.</p>
<p>He is a father of four, and he and his wife Mal, moved to Tawa from his home town of Tokoroa.</p>
<p>His work has included being the lead Treaty settlement negotiator for Ngati Raukawa, a self-employed consultant, education manager at Raukawa Trust Board and teacher at Tokoroa High School.</p>
<p>He is a member of the Te Ohu Kaimoana electoral college, former chairman of the Raukawa Settlement Trust and just recently gained a Masters Degree in Business Administration.  </p>
