<p><strong>Thursday, 5 December 2013, 8:53 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>NZ Awash with Immigrant Crime</strong></p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters says the $120 million drugs and property bust yesterday shows that Immigration New Zealand and its political masters have no idea they are bringing organised crime into the country.</p>
<p>More than 330kg of pseudoephedrine was seized in the bust and it is believed to have been smuggled in from China in shipping containers.</p>
<p>Mr Peters says it is significant that interpreters for the Mandarin, Cantonese and Korean languages were needed in court, although all of the accused are permanent residents or New Zealand citizens.</p>
<p>“We have warned for many years that successive governments were blindly importing people without any idea of their criminal backgrounds and this case proves it.</p>
<p>“There was obviously some immigration fraud because of the language issue and the fact that crime was being carried out on such a massive scale.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says there was a lone voice at Immigration New Zealand warning against fast track visas and the shonky visa arrangements organised by the present government.</p>
<p>“There will be many more cases of organised crime surfacing in the forthcoming months and years and it has been helped by lax immigration policies and a dysfunctional department.</p>
<p>“When governments allow the Mr and Mrs Bigs of the Asian Drugs World into New Zealand they expose thousands of New Zealanders to lives of misery and crime.</p>
<p>“It’s long past time to start securely guarding our borders against people who use our residency and citizenship laws to commit crime,” says Mr Peters.</p>
