<p>Kiwis send a message to Key with big asset sales no vote</p>
<p>New Zealanders have sent an overwhelming message to the National Government: stop your failed asset sales programme now, Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman said today.</p>
<p>Preliminary results in the asset sales referendum show 67% voted &#39;no&#39; to asset sales.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders have sent John Key a clear message: stop the asset sales,&quot; said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“The National Government must now listen to New Zealand and cancel the sale of Genesis Energy.</p>
<p>&quot;John Key has arrogantly labelled Kiwis who oppose asset sales as extremists but tonight we have shown that by a margin of two to one Kiwis are against privatisation, and it is Mr Key who is out of touch with mainstream New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The Government did everything it could to undermine the referendum. It dumped it at the end of the year, and recklessly rushed through asset sales prior to the referendum. But New Zealanders have turned out in droves to say no more.</p>
<p>“The public of New Zealand has ignored John Key’s insults and spoiling tactics; they have turned out in force to say ‘no’ to asset sales.</p>
<p>“This is a very high ‘no’ vote and a very good turnout for a postal vote. It is unambiguous. The Government must stop its privatisation agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to congratulate the New Zealanders who took the time to take part in the referendum. I also want to thank both the 327,000 people who signed the petition to trigger the referendum and the thousands of volunteers who collected signatures.</p>
<p>“This referendum is not only a clear and unambiguous rejection of National’s current privatisation programme. It also means that no future government can claim a mandate to sell the public’s assets. We have not only stopped the current asset sales in their tracks; we’ve stopped future sales as well,” said Dr Norman.</p>
