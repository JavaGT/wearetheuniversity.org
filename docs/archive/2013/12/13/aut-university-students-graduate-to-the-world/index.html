<p><strong>AUT University students graduate to the world</strong></p>
<p>This week as many university students prepare to graduate with their undergraduate degrees, nine AUT students will also be packing their bags and preparing to jet off to the USA for their first taste of work-life inside a global organisation.</p>
<p>The nine students, who are about to graduate from a range of AUT degree programmes, will soon call New York, San Francisco or Los Angeles home for up to three months, taking up residence in businesses that align with their area of study such as Saatchi &amp; Saatchi NY, Westpac Americas and Paramount Recording Studios. The students are the first recipients of the AUT InterNZ international scholarship programme – the first of its type for a New Zealand University – designed to grow leadership skills in a global context through full immersion in the local market and culture.</p>
<p>AUT University’s Vice Chancellor Derek McCormack says: “We saw the need to create more opportunities for New Zealand young achievers to tune and expand their capability through the experience of working and living in global markets with different business cultures. We are starting the AUT InterNZ programme in the United States – a hugely significant market – but with the aim of extending it to other parts of the world.</p>
<p>_“_The AUT InterNZ programme will help our brightest and best to acquire an understanding of business in a global context with experiences that will enhance their skills and capabilities in ways that are sure to be attractive and beneficial to New Zealand employers.</p>
<p>“Our industry-host partners in the United States participating in the programme’s inaugural year are superb – recognised leaders in finance, business re-structuring, design, technology, social innovation, sport and entertainment.”</p>
<p>The seed funding for the AUT InterNZ programme was raised in 2012 at the Al Gore, Global Leader’s dinner event, supported by sponsors including Westpac Bank and AUT University.</p>
<p>The scholarship covers return air travel and transfers to the destination city, US visa administration costs, travel and health insurance, plus a living and accommodation allowance.</p>
<p>The 2014 AUT InterNZ industry host partners are:</p>
<p>• Westpac Americas, New York</p>
<p>• Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, New York</p>
<p>• Play Rugby USA, New York</p>
<p>• Red Antler, New York</p>
<p>• The B-Team, New York</p>
<p>• Public Restaurant (AvroCo Hospitality Group), New York</p>
<p>• Zolfo Cooper, New York</p>
<p>• Paramount Recording Studios, Los Angeles</p>
<p>• Kiwi Landing Pad, San Francisco</p>
<p>The long-term plan is to expand the programme in the United States as well as to launch it into other markets.</p>
