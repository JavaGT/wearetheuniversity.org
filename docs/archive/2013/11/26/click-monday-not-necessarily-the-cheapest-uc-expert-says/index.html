<p><strong>Click Monday not necessarily the cheapest, UC marketing expert says</strong></p>
<p><strong>November 26, 2013</strong></p>
<p>Click Monday is not necessarily the cheapest day of the year to buy goods, a University of Canterbury (UC) marketing expert says.</p>
<p>As seen last night, Click Monday is quickly becoming an online shoppers&#39; dream as people seek out cheaper prices on products that may make great Christmas presents, Associate Professor Ekant Veer says.</p>
<p>``Unfortunately, many savvy buyers are slowly finding out that the click Monday sales, although enticing, are not necessarily the cheapest price during the year nor are the products the current &#39;trendy&#39; products, but being old lines and out of date products.</p>
<p>``As such, Click Monday is more akin to excitement and mob mentality associated with purchasing behaviour, rather than rational savings behaviour or utility maximisation.  </p>
<p>``That is, people get all geared up thinking they&#39;ll get a saving but, in reality, they&#39;re getting caught up with the excitement of the event. It&#39;s not the same as Black Friday shopping (in the US), which has a lot more of a personal aspect to their behaviour. You actually see people fighting for limited stock, so you are willing to fight more for something you don&#39;t really need.</p>
<p>``There will be a definite spike in online sales, worldwide, not so much in New Zealand as local retailers are not so on-board or prevalent as they are overseas. Our major online retailing site is Trademe, which is more of a peer to peer retailer, rather than a business to consumer retailer, which is where the biggest savings are.’’</p>
<p>Black Friday is the Friday after Thanksgiving in the US where shoppers go nuts at sales, Professor Veer says. Shoppers become a mob in places and fights break out in stores while people try to get discounts.</p>
<p>``Look at the Black Friday YouTube videos. It&#39;s crazy!’’</p>
<p>More than 60 New Zealand retailers began offering discounts to online shoppers today through a 24-hour pre-Christmas sale that started 7pm last night.</p>
<p>The promotion, Click Monday, is the first attempt in New Zealand to emulate a popular event in the United States known as Cyber Monday and which has spread to Australia and China.</p>
<p>The Click Monday website is offering deals from retailers that include Ezibuy, Hallensteins, MightyApe, Fishpond, Countdown, Pascoes, Bendon, Icebreaker, Macpac and Toyworld.</p>
