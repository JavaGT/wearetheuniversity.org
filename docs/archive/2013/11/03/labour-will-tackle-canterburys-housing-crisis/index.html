<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Labour will tackle Canterbury’s housing crisis</strong></p>
<p>Labour will tackle Canterbury’s housing crisis head-on by building 10,000 affordable KiwiBuild homes in the region in the first four years of the programme, Labour Leader David Cunliffe says.</p>
<p>“Rents in quake-affected areas of Christchurch, Waimakariri and Selwyn are sky-rocketing.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment estimates up to 7400 people are living in insecure housing. Many more are living in overcrowded or substandard conditions.</p>
<p>“The Ministry estimates there is a 7000-house shortfall. This must be addressed and Labour’s pragmatic plan will do just that.</p>
<p>“Labour will also back efforts to revitalise New Brighton by working with the community, local businesses and the City Council. We will fast track the rebuilding of this suburb into a vibrant and modern beachside community.</p>
<p>“Through KiwiBuild we will ensure there are affordable houses in New Brighton. A revamp of the retail precinct will free up space for 200 new homes, with further development creating potential for up to 500 new dwellings.</p>
<p>“The New Brighton Community Revitalisation Project will kick-start our KiwiBuild programme  beginning with existing government and council land assets. It is a marker for more to come.</p>
<p>“Labour will also investigate the use of appropriate Red Zone land and properties as a stop gap measure for temporary accomodation. It is senseless to demolish houses when there is a pressing need for rental accommodation.</p>
<p>“Where it is safe and feasible, we will look at renting homes on the edge of the Red Zone, near houses that have been retained.</p>
<p>“The time has come for the Government to stop denying there is a housing crisis in Canterbury. Labour is prepared to take action,” David Cunliffe says.</p>
