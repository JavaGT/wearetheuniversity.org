<p>Students back union&#39;s plan for tertiary education</p>
<p>Today Victoria University of Wellington Students&#39; Association President Rory McCourt supported the Tertiary Education Union&#39;s $1b plan for fixing New Zealand&#39;s university and polytechnic sector, announced today at the union&#39;s annual conference.</p>
<p>McCourt said &quot;Under this government, our universities are going backwards with more and more prescription, micro-management and competition rather than trust, autonomy and collaboration.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders expect our universities to be the critic and conscience of society, to hold up a mirror glass and challenge the way we see ourselves and our choices. They expect us to do more than address the labour shortages of today. We&#39;ve forgotten that. We&#39;ve replaced knowledge centres with jobs factories, and that&#39;s unwise.” he said.</p>
<p>McCourt applauded the recommendations to address education quality and access in the union&#39;s Blueprint, but said more work could be done to address the weekly level of student allowances and living cost loans.</p>
<p>&quot;When 1 in 6 students live in abject poverty by their third year, and a majority can&#39;t borrow enough each week to eat, or heat their flats; something is seriously wrong in this land of plenty&quot; said McCourt.</p>
<p>&quot;We support the TEU&#39;s call for more access to student allowances and restoration of funding to our universities and polytechnics. Education should be for all, not just a few&quot; concluded McCourt.</p>
