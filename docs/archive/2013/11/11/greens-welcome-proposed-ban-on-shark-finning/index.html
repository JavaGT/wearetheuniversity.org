<p><strong>Greens welcome proposed ban on shark finning</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party today welcomed the Government’s announcement that New Zealand will finally ban shark finning.</p>
<p>Today the National Plan of Action – Sharks was released and it contains a proposal to ban shark finning. Shark finning is the practice of killing a shark, cutting off its fins and discarding the carcass back to sea.</p>
<p>“Shark finning is a hugely wasteful practice, and I’m delighted that the Government have finally acknowledged that we can’t allow this activity to continue in our waters,” Green Party oceans spokesperson Gareth Hughes said.</p>
<p>“The Greens have been calling for a ban on shark finning for over 5 years, and it is great that the Government has finally woken up to the importance of this issue,” said Mr Hughes.</p>
<p>“98 other countries have already banned shark finning, so continuing it was always a big risk to our international brand.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders wouldn’t want an elephant killed for its tusks or a rhino for its horns, and sharks shouldn’t be killed and dumped at sea just for their fins.</p>
<p>“I am urging the Government to implement a ‘fins naturally attached’ policy, which is a simple, cheap and easy to enforce measure requiring vessels to keep the whole shark, rather than discarding carcasses at sea, encouraging full utilisation.</p>
<p>“I would like to congratulate the New Zealand Shark Alliance and all parties in Parliament who came on board with the campaign to persuade National to do the right thing.</p>

<p>“It’s heartening that we now have cross-party consensus to ban shark finning in New Zealand waters.”</p>
<p>The proposal will now be released for a 4 week public consultation period, with a final decision due around Christmas.</p>
<p>“I’m confident that the thousands of Kiwis who have spoken up against shark finning will submit again, and secure this momentous win for sharks,” said Mr Hughes.</p>
<p>“The Minister’s decision today marks a victory in the Greens’ work to save sharks, and I’m happy to support this draft plan.”</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
