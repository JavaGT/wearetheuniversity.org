<p><strong>New Hunter Fellows announced</strong></p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington has announced its four latest Hunter Fellows, who will be recognised in a ceremony in the University’s iconic Hunter Building next month.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says he is delighted to have the opportunity to recognise the valuable contributions made by the late Rosemary Barrington, Clare Galambos-Winter, David Lawrence and Peter Osborne.</p>
<p>“Hunter Fellows are people who have made a substantial contribution to Victoria University through their time, expertise, networks or personal resources,” says Professor Walsh.</p>
<p>The Hunter Fellowship was first presented in 2003 by the University Council, replacing the previous Award for Distinguished Service. Since then Victoria University has recognised 23 dedicated members of the University community through the Hunter Fellowship.</p>
<p><strong>The Hunter Fellowships will be presented on Monday 2 December 2013 in the Council Chamber, Hunter Building, Kelburn Parade at 6pm.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 2013 Hunter Fellows</strong><br><strong>Rosemary Barrington</strong><br>Rosemary’s association with Victoria spanned nearly five decades. As a student, she was International Affairs Officer and Women’s Vice-President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA), and was instrumental in forming the first crèche at Victoria. In more recent years, she served the University at the highest level, as a University Council member since 1999 and as Chancellor of Victoria from 2002-2004. During her life, Rosemary was an active campaigner for equality for women and human rights.</p>
<p><strong>Clare Galambos-Winter</strong><br>Clare is a significant supporter of Victoria University and nurtures the training of young musicians. A Holocaust survivor, Clare came to New Zealand from Hungary in 1948, joining the newly formed New Zealand Symphony Orchestra as a violinist and playing for the Orchestra for 33 years. When she finally laid down her bow in her eighties, Clare gifted her two violins to the New Zealand School of Music and established endowed scholarships in violin performance. She also funds a Prize in Holocaust Studies at Victoria to promote understanding and tolerance.</p>
<p><strong>David Lawrence</strong><br>David Lawrence is one of New Zealand’s most prolific theatre directors who has made a important contribution to Victoria University’s Summer Shakespeare programme. David has been directly involved in nine Summer Shakespeare productions. He has been a member of the Summer Shakespeare Board for the past three years, is currently co-chair, and mentors directors of Summer Shakespeare productions.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Osborne</strong><br>Peter Osborne has been part of the Old Boys University Rugby Football Club for more than 60 years and has made a substantial contribution to rugby at Victoria. As a student, Peter played fullback for the club and went on to serve as a club administrator for many years. He has been president and captain and has worked tirelessly organising coaches, teams and the club in many capacities. He also assisted with fundraising for the redevelopment of Boyd-Wilson Field in 2010.</p>
