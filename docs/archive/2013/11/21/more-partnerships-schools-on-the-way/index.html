<p>More Partnerships Schools on the way</p>
<p>“I welcome Minister of Education Hon Hekia Parata’s announcement of the second application round for Partnership Schools | Kura Hourua to open day one, term one, in 2015” ACT Leader John Banks said today.</p>
<p>“Partnership Schools are here to stay. They will be a permanent part of our education system.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe any future Government will abandon New Zealand’s world leading model, Mr Banks said.</p>
<p>“What Partnership Schools do is give educators greater flexibility in return of greater accountability for getting better results for some of New Zealand’s most vulnerable students.</p>
<p>“What is not to like in that?</p>
<p>“These learners deserve to be a productive part of New Zealand’s future. I want them to know that we value them and their potential.</p>
<p>“They deserve the opportunity of a world class education. Partnership Schools help make that opportunity real for more of our young.</p>
<p>“I want parents to know that Partnership Schools offer them a greater choice to find the school best suited to the needs of their child.</p>
<p>“I am also confident that just as the first five partnership schools are attracting interest from dedicated, committed educators, the next five will too.</p>
<p>“To the PPTA and NZEI unions I say get over it and get on board if you really value education and talented educators,&quot; Mr Banks said.</p>
