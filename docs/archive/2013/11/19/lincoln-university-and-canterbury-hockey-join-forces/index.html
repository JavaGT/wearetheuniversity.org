<p><strong>Lincoln University and Canterbury Hockey join forces</strong></p>
<p>Lincoln University has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Canterbury Hockey that provides English language tuition for international students who also wish to undertake intensive hockey training and skills development.</p>
<p>The agreement largely mirrors an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in June this year between the Canterbury Rugby Football Union, the Canterbury Crusaders franchise and Lincoln University to provide English language tuition and development coaching for international rugby athletes in the Sevens code.</p>
<p>Lincoln University’s contribution to the MoU with Canterbury Hockey includes tuition in reading, listening, speaking and integrated writing through the University’s Foundation Studies and English Language Division. The University will also provide strength and conditioning training, conduct seminars in mental skill development and nutrition, and provide fitness assessments through its Recreation Centre.</p>
<p>The programme has a 12 week duration with the first intake expected to commence 24 March 2014.</p>
<p>The MoU was signed by Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor, Dr Andrew West and Canterbury Hockey’s Chief Executive, Rod Templeton.</p>
<p>“The English language and sports programmes are an exciting opportunity for international students to experience the specialised strengths of the university and the sporting bodies. Students can improve both their English and sports skills, and at the same time be exposed to university life and sporting elites within the New Zealand context” says Dr Lorraine Petelo, Director, Foundation Studies and English Language Division, Lincoln University.</p>
<p>Lincoln University has a long-standing relationship with Canterbury Hockey through its Sports Scholarship programme. The programme allows for student athletes to take an undergraduate degree while receiving comprehensive training and coaching over the duration of their study. The scholarship also covers university tuition fees.</p>
