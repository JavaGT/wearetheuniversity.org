<p><strong>UC researchers undertaking cricket study over summer</strong></p>
<p><strong>November 14, 2013</strong></p>
<p>A University of Canterbury (UC) sports scientist is supervising a summer scholarship cricket research project to gain an understanding of where a batsman is likely to hit a ball from certain types of deliveries. </p>
<p>Dr Carl Petersen, who has carried out significant cricket research overseas, will supervise UC summer scholarship student Rob Genet on the project to help coaches and captains.</p>
<p>``Teams traditionally keep a lot of their performance analysis information in-house. We will attempt to publish some useful findings that will help captains in positioning their field, based on the delivery type the bowler is attempting to bowl. The bowler will still need to execute their skill to optimise the information effectively,’’ Dr Petersen says. </p>
<p>``All forms of professional cricket typically target opposition and look historically at how particular batsmen have performed and their methods of dismissal to devise strategies on how to dismiss a batsman.</p>
<p>``This research will take a longer term look and is more generic as to the probability distribution over a whole series of games, across a wider range of players.</p>
<p>``Setting the field, and providing information as to where a ball is and more importantly, is not likely going to be hit will aide in field placing and devising bowling strategies, especially in the shorter forms of the game. </p>
<p>``We will be researching a mixture of international T20 and one day cricket internationals, analysing data collected from many games. </p>

<p>``Most professional and international cricket sides now recognise the value of video recordings by employing a professional match analyst. A camera is used to log each ball that is bowled, which is then coded by various software applications to enable quick database retrieval.</p>
<p>``My recent research has determined the magnitude of performance indicators in contributing to limited over match success in both forms of the limited game.</p>
<p>``This summer study will determine the wagon wheel distributions of 24 bowling delivery types and their resultant batting placement outcomes,’’ Dr Petersen says.</p>
<p>Genet recently completed a research project on fast bowling accuracy and fatigue for his degree course.</p>
<p>About 150 UC students will be undertaking scholarship research projects this summer. On top of that, almost 1000 students have applied to take part in summer courses.</p>
<p>Around 600 tradesmen will be on campus over the summer as the University’s building remediation programme ramps up.</p>
