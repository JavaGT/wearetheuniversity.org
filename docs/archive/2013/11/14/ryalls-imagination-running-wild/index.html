<p>Ryall’s imagination running wild  </p>
<p>It is clear Health Minister Tony Ryall is doctoring statistics around the number of patients being dumped off waiting lists, Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“It is outrageous that the Minister claims there isn’t a problem when almost daily we are hearing of people not being able to access health services, waiting months to see a specialist, or not receiving proper care.</p>
<p>“Just two months ago Mr Ryall told Parliament that as of June this year just 20 patients nation-wide had been waiting longer than six months to be assessed or have surgery.</p>
<p>“He either has a vivid imagination or is making it up because information provided to me by district health boards paints a very different picture.</p>
<p>“For instance, at Waikato as of June 2013 there were 376 patients listed as having been waiting longer than six months while MidCentral had 161 people in the same situation.</p>
<p>“Another eight DHBs said they didn’t even collect the data. So, if they couldn’t provide me with it, where did Mr Ryall get his information from?</p>
<p>“With rising demand for healthcare services and rising numbers of people who are turning up at accident and emergency departments because they can’t afford to see a GP the problem isn’t going to disappear, as much as Mr Ryall would like it to.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of patients are now receiving letters telling them they need an operation, but because it can’t be done in Tony Ryall’s time frame they are dumped off the list.”</p>
