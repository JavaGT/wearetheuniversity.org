<p>14 November 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Transport Minister embarrassing on climate change</strong></p>
<p>Transport minister Gerry Brownlee&#39;s refusal to accept that man-made climate change is real is both deeply embarrassing and deeply concerning says Labour&#39;s climate change spokesperson Moana Mackey.</p>
<p>“The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report considers man-made global warming &quot;extremely likely&quot; - an elevation from the IPCC&#39;s 2007 assessment which classified it as &quot;very likely&quot;. While this might seem like semantics to some, in scientific terms it is extremely significant.</p>
<p>“It reflects the overwhelming scientific consensus that it is human activities that have caused the problem and that only a change in human behaviour can mitigate the most serious impacts of climate change on our planet.</p>
<p>“It is extraordinary that in this day and age senior Ministers in the National Government are still debating the science of climate change.</p>
<p>“I wonder whether Minister Brownlee thinks that the thousands of scientists around the world who have been working on this issue for decades are mistaken, lying, or perhaps participating in a global conspiracy to fool us all?</p>
<p>“It&#39;s as ridiculous as his claim that he was set up by TV3 to look foolish. His antiquated views on climate change are what embarrassed him - nothing else.</p>
<p>“Transport accounts for 19% of New Zealand&#39;s greenhouse gas emissions and 42% of our carbon dioxide emissions. It has been the single fastest growing sector with emissions increasing 63% since 1990. New Zealander&#39;s can have no confidence that Minister Brownlee will do anything to reduce transport emissions.”</p>
