<p><strong>Culturally targeted education vital to curb drownings</strong></p>
<p>Water safety messages need to be adapted for Auckland’s increasingly diverse and growing ethnic population as more migrants drown in our seas, rivers and lakes, says Massey University sociologist Distinguished Professor Paul Spoonley.</p>
<p>He is speaking at the WaterSafe Auckland forum today [Friday, 15 November] on the challenges of water safety and drowning prevention in the context of supercity Auckland’s ethnic diversity.</p>
<p>Half, or ten of the twenty, who drowned in the region last year were of Māori, Pasifika or Asian descent, according to statistics, up from the five-year average of 48 per cent.</p>
<p>“Immigrants typically choose Auckland because of the quality of the lifestyle, including the physical environment,” Professor Spoonley says. “But they bring new approaches to leisure and the use of that environment. How do – and should – local organisations respond?”</p>
<p>“The rapidly changing ethnic demographics of Auckland challenge organisations like WaterSafe Auckland, especially if these new Aucklanders are to remain safer around water.”</p>
<p>Sandy Harrop, CEO WaterSafe Auckland, says her organisation is looking at ways to “meet this challenge in delivering water safety education that meets the needs of all Aucklanders.”</p>
<p>Drownings occur in specific activities such as rock fishing, where Chinese and Koreans in particular feature predominantly, she says. “But many incidents involving other Asian groups are increasing, with Indians being the most common,” says Ms Harrop. “There have been at least three fatal drownings to date this year involving people of the Indian ethnicity, and numerous rescues as well.”</p>

<p>Professor Spoonley, who has been researching and writing on New Zealand’s immigration, employment, social and economic trends for over 30 years, says, “the most obvious growth concerns Asian communities who are expected to grow from about five per cent of Auckland’s population in 1991 to 27-28 per cent in the 2020s.”</p>
<p>He says the most significant reason immigrants give for coming to live and work in Auckland is the quality of life, including the city’s physical environment.</p>
<p>“Asians – and other immigrants – enjoy the sea, lakes and rivers of Auckland but they do not always appreciate some of the challenges and dangers. The challenge is how best to ensure that they enjoy the facilities, remain safe and appreciate the cultural values of Auckland.”</p>
<p>“The new multiculturalism of Auckland means that some of the things organisations have done in the past no longer apply – or need to be tweaked so that the message gets through. The challenge is always whether new immigrants understand what is safe – or not – around water.”</p>
<p>Professor Spoonley will discuss WaterSafe Auckland’s future challenges in the delivery of its services; and in relation to the various ways people use the city’s coastline and aquatic assets for social connections, community wellbeing and economic development.</p>
<p>The Regional Water Safety and Drowning Prevention Forum is at the Marine Rescue Centre, Solent Street, Mechanics Bay, from 9am on Friday, 15 November.</p>
