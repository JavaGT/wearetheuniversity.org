<p><strong>Eleanor Catton wins top Canadian literary prize</strong></p>
<p>Eleanor Catton has won the prestigious Canadian Governor General’s Literary Award for fiction for her novel <em>The Luminaries.</em> The announcement was made today at a ceremony in Toronto. The Governor General’s Award follows Ms Catton’s Man Booker Prize win last month in London.</p>
<p>Speaking from the award ceremony in Toronto, Ms Catton said she was absolutely delighted with her win.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very moved that <em>The Luminaries</em> has been recognised by the office of the Canadian Governor General and the Canada Council for the Arts,” she says.</p>
<p>Ms Catton’s New Zealand publisher Fergus Barrowman, of Victoria University Press, says the Governor General’s Award is another great accolade for a novel that is proving to be as popular with readers as it is with critics and judges.</p>
<p>Since its release in August, <em>The Luminaries</em> has sat on the top of the New Zealand best-seller charts, and total New Zealand sales will top 50,000 when current back orders are filled from the next reprint.</p>
<p><em>The Luminaries</em> was one of five finalist fiction titles for the CAD$25,000 award. Former winners include internationally acclaimed authors Margaret Atwood, Alice Munro and Michael Ondaatje. Ms Catton was born in Canada, making her eligible for the prize.</p>
<p>“I am excited that national literatures around the world are becoming more porous and more accepting of difference,” says Ms Catton, “and on a personal level, it&#39;s very nice to have more than one home.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Catton will return to New Zealand in January 2014 and will be a guest at a number of Writers and Readers Festivals next year, including Wellington in March and Auckland in May.</p>
