<p>Dr Shaun Barker wins Waldemar Lindgren Award</p>
<p>University of Waikato Senior Lecturer Dr Shaun Barker, who joined the University’s Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences in November 2012, has been awarded an international young scientist award by the Society of Economic Geologists (SEG). The Waldemar Lindgren Award of the Society of Economic Geologists is made annually by SEG to a young scientist whose published research represents an outstanding contribution to the science of economic geology at an early stage of his or her career.</p>
<p>Dr Barker is originally from Otago University where he completed a BSc(Hons) (2004). He then undertook doctoral studies at The Australian National University (completed 2007) before taking up a post-doctoral position at the University of British Columbia until his appointment to the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>Dr Barker has published strongly in the international literature and this award recognises in part his use of new and emerging analytical techniques to address various problems that had previously been difficult to solve.</p>
<p>Many of the previous 46 recipients of the Lindgren Award have gone on to distinguished careers in academia, industry, or government research organizations (or some combination of these).</p>
<p>Dr Barker has been invited to receive his award at next year’s SEG conference in Colorado in September 2014, his travel and conference costs being met by SEG. A citation and acceptance speech from the 2014 meeting will be published in the journal Economic Geology.</p>
