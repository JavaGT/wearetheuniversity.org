<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong><br>New Zealand First Leader<br>20 November 2013</p>
<p><strong>Serious Errors at Immigration “Visa Factory”</strong></p>
<p>Immigration New Zealand has become a rubber stamping visa factory to cover up the numbers of Kiwis leaving the country, Rt Hon Winston Peters claimed in Parliament today.</p>
<p>In Parliament, he asked the Prime Minister why the Immigration Minister had not been sacked for putting quantity over quality when decisions were made about which applicants were to be allowed into New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The Auditor General pointed out in 2009 that immigration target setting should be reviewed to ensure the quality of visa and permit decisions but that has been ignored and the situation is now worse.</p>
<p>“Immigration New Zealand’s own internal quality assurance results indicate that more than 20 per cent of decisions are of poor quality.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters pointed out that this level of deliberate incompetence meant that thousands of questionable people were coming into New Zealand and he claimed the Minister was well aware of the situation.</p>
<p>“The Minister knows what is happening but is ignoring it to achieve positive net immigration to neutralise and disguise the number of New Zealanders leaving for Australia.</p>
<p>“Immigration officials are working on a quota based system and ignoring their own policies as they rubber stamp applications to please their political masters.</p>
<p>“Our information – from Immigration New Zealand itself – says this situation is leading to many low quality migrants coming to New Zealand with resulting fallout such as under-employment and further burdens on taxpayers.”</p>

<p>Mr Peters also claimed that INZ wasted taxpayers’ money flying 30 people from around the world back to New Zealand to take part in a lavish eating, drinking and talking conference in Wellington recently.</p>
<p>“The Minister himself turned up at the trough without a thought for the poor taxpayers footing the bill.</p>
<p>“There is a culture of abuse, carelessness and disrespect at INZ and it must be brought under control,” said Mr Peters.</p>
