<p>Chris<br>HIPKINS</p>
<p>Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>Megan<br>Woods</p>
<p>Associate Education (Christchurch) Spokesperson</p>
<p>20 October 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  </p>
<p><strong>Education about people, not profits</strong></p>
<p>The National government’s agenda to corporatize and privatise the education system is becoming clearer by the day, Labour says.</p>
<p>“Not content with introducing privately run charter schools, the Government is now considering using Public Private Partnerships for all of the school rebuilding work required in Christchurch,” Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins said.</p>
<p>“Clearly there is no limit to the National Party’s profit-making ambitions when it comes to education. They’re even willing to use the Canterbury earthquakes as an excuse to corporatize and privatise schooling.</p>
<p>“PPPs will take the power away from local communities and hand it straight to private and corporate interests. They will see money that should be going into education instead being paid out in shareholder dividends.</p>
<p>“Decisions around school rebuilds should be based on what’s best for education, not what’s going to maximise profits for the private sector,” Chris Hipkins said.</p>
<p>Labour’s Associate Education spokesperson Megan Woods is concerned that local schools in Christchurch are being shut out of critical decisions being made around the rebuild.</p>
<p>“Hekia Parata made it very clear in Parliament today that the local Christchurch community will have no right of veto over the use of PPPs for school rebuilds.</p>
<p>“It’s yet another example of people in Christchurch having central government decisions imposed on them without ever having the chance to have a meaningful say.</p>
<p>“Our local communities in Christchurch could end up with new buildings they have little or no control over the use of. That is not right,” Megan Woods said.</p>
