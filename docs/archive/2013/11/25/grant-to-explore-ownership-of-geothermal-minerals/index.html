<p><strong>Grant to explore ownership of geothermal minerals</strong></p>
<p>University of Waikato law professor Barry Barton has received a $69,000 grant to carry out a study of the ownership of rights to minerals found in geothermal fluids.</p>
<p>Geothermal water and steam produced for electricity generation and heating contain dissolved minerals and gas which may have commercial value.</p>
<p>One question in unlocking that value is ownership.</p>
<p>The law on the matter is not clear, and various claims can be made to the minerals under different legislation and different rules of law.</p>
<p>Professor Barton will examine the different possibilities under the current law, and will consider desirable law reform in order to provide clarification.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment grant is part of a two-year $400,000 GNS Science project, From Waste to Wealth: Commercial Recovery of Products from Geothermal Fluids. Professor Barton says it is a pleasure to be working on an interdisciplinary project with GNS Science geothermal specialists that could find new value in geothermal resources.</p>
<p>“New ways of looking at our resources may improve the efficiency of our use of them, and improve the environmental outcomes,” he says.</p>
<p>“There is an interesting but complex legal question at the heart of the matter.”</p>
<p>Professor Barton is Director of the Centre for Environmental, Resources and Energy Law.</p>
