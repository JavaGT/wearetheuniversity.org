<p><strong>The shame project</strong></p>
<p>Psychology student Samantha Brennan is undertaking New Zealand’s first study on shame and resilience for her PhD at Waikato University.</p>
<p>Samantha is conducting a series of interviews with Pākehā New Zealanders over the age of 18 who identify with the topic and are will to discuss their experiences with shame.</p>
<p>Established research has found that shame is a contributing factor in many psychological and health problems that affect New Zealanders - depression, anxiety and stress to name a few.</p>
<p>“Shame is a common emotion, experienced by just about everyone at some times in their lives, but it is not commonly spoken about,” says Samantha.</p>
<p>Her PhD is titled ‘Shame and resilience among Pākehā New Zealanders’ and she hopes that her research will ultimately help more New Zealanders to achieve resilience in their lives.</p>
<p>Shame and resilience are both areas Samantha is passionate about. “I first became interested in shame research when I stumbled upon a video presentation given by Brené Brown and I strongly resonated with the experience of shame in the way it was presented.”</p>
<p>“I recognised shame as a powerful motivator in my own life, and I appreciated being able to reflect on and critically analyse its influence in my research.”</p>
<p>The mother of two has found through her interview discussions that we may actually need shame.</p>
<p>“As I talked to more people, I started to realise that we actually need shame in our lives, although it’s unpleasant, it’s actually useful. For one, it helps us to keep a monitor on relationships and repair them when we need to.”</p>

<p>She says shame can also cause people to question their identity which in turn strengthens character.</p>
<p>Samantha’s supervisor Dr Neville Robertson says that shame is inherently social and cultural.</p>
<p>“We learn what we should be ashamed about from the people around us and from the wider culture. Thus it makes sense to study shame within a particular cultural context and as far as we can tell, no one has studied shame with a Pākehā context.”</p>
<p>Samantha says that almost everyone experiences shame, but not everyone experiences the negative effects of shame.</p>
<p>“Some people can overcome shame, going on to lead healthy, resilient lives and a goal of my research is to find out what allows some people to thrive and develop resilience in the face of adversity.</p>
