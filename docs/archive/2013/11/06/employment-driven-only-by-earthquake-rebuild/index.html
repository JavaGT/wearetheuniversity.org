<p><strong>Wednesday, 6 November 2013, 12:09 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Employment driven only by earthquake rebuild</p>
<p>There are now 45,000 more Kiwis out of work since National took office, Labour’s Employment spokesperson Grant Robertson says.</p>
<p>“Household Labour Force Survey figures released today show the total number of people classified as jobless rose by 12,500 in September 2013 to 257,900.</p>
<p>“Without the Christchurch rebuild, the unemployment rate nationwide would be 6.5 per cent.</p>
<p>“When it comes to jobs, Christchurch is the only driver keeping New Zealand’s head above water. Relying on national disasters is not a jobs plan.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile many regions are being hit with job losses; in Shannon the tannery has closed and in Rotorua the sawmill has been shut down. Unemployment is up in a number of regions including Northland, Waikato, Gisborne-Hawkes Bay and Southland.</p>
<p>“National has broken its promise to New Zealanders on jobs. They promised in 2011 to create 170,000 new jobs. Yet in the past two years they have created only 53,000. That is more than 63,000 new jobs short of what they need to reach their target.</p>
<p>“National is busy telling New Zealanders the economy is on the up and there are jobs for those who want them.</p>
<p>“However, 150,000 Kiwis are still struggling to find jobs to feed their families and pay their rents and mortgages.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is also falling behind other countries, with our OECD ranking by unemployment rates dropping in the June quarter from 12th to 13th of 34 countries.</p>
<p>“A Labour government would take a hands-on approach to economic growth. We would work with the regions and industry to ensure our once vibrant communities don’t become ghost towns,” Grant Robertson says.</p>
