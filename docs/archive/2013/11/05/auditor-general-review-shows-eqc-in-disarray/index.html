<p>Earthquake Commission Spokesperson</p>
<p>5 November 2013               MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Auditor General review shows EQC in disarray</strong></p>
<p>Gerry Brownlee must pull his head out of the sand and act on the Auditor General’s scathing report on the Earthquake Commission, says Labour’s Earthquake Commission spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
<p>“The Auditor General’s findings that EQC is in disarray are nothing new to the people of Canterbury. They have been trying to tell Gerry Brownlee this for years but he has stuck his fingers in his ears.</p>
<p>“Mr Brownlee must listen to the Auditor General and take action.</p>
<p>“The report says EQC communicated badly with homeowners, provided inconsistent information and is making Cantabrians wait for long periods with no information.</p>
<p>“It says a fifth of homeowners have been dissatisfied with repairs, including quality and the time it took.</p>
<p>“It also says EQC took too long to allocate repair slots to vulnerable people.</p>
<p>“That’s simply not good enough. Cantabrians wanted to have faith in EQC but they have been let down.</p>
<p>“Cantabrians didn’t need an Auditor-General report to tell them how bad things were at EQC. But Gerry Brownlee does. Maybe now he will accept that, under his watch as minister, EQC is in disarray.</p>
<p>“Cantabrians realise the earthquakes were an unprecedented series of events and EQC had to gear up but three years on is far too long for EQC to start to lift its performance. The people of Canterbury have been telling the government EQC hasn’t been working for years. It is time for Gerry Brownlee to take action and do his job,” says Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
