<p>NZ’s Universities Sign Cooperation Agreement with France</p>
<p>28 November 2013</p>
<p>Stronger academic cooperation between New Zealand and France to enhance the quality of university education and research is a step closer with an agreement signed today at the French Embassy by Universities New Zealand - Te Pōkai Tara and its French equivalent the Conférence des Présidents d’Université (CPU).</p>
<p>The New Zealand–France Academic Links agreement includes university staff and student exchanges, sharing of research, and facilitating connections between academics in teaching and research.</p>
<p>Professor Roy Crawford, Chair of Universities NZ, says that with about 55 formal relationships between New Zealand and French universities already in place, the agreement formalises and complements both countries’ long standing relationship in the education sphere.</p>
<p>“Education is a key aspect of the wider bilateral relationship and best secures enduring people-to-people links, particularly with alumni adding to the spirit of partnership and cultural understanding.”</p>
<p>The agreement, signed by Professor Crawford and Mr Legadec the President of the University of New Caledonia and a CPU representative, will provide a smoother pathway towards academic cooperation by offering information on the equivalence of New Zealand and French qualifications.</p>
<p>Professor Crawford says that research and science collaboration is also a key part of the agreement to encourage academics to pursue further joint research programmes.</p>

<p>“Teaching and research are interdependent, and this is strongly reflected in the agreement which seeks to enhance the quality of both. Research partnerships between French and New Zealand universities are already happening, often involving postgraduate students also, but we’d like to build on these and explore further possibilities for research collaboration.”</p>
<p>He says the excellent reputation of both countries’ universities bodes well for future cooperation and mutual benefit.</p>
<p>France is in the top 20 source countries of international students for New Zealand, with half of the students studying at Bachelor’s level and almost a quarter completing PhDs. France offers a suite of scholarships for New Zealand students to study in France.</p>
