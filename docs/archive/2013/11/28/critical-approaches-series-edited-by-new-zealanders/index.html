<p>Critical Approaches series edited by New Zealanders</p>
<p>Massey health psychologists Professor Kerry Chamberlain and Associate Professor Antonia Lyons will act as series editors for an important new series of health texts Critical Approaches to Health by major UK publisher, Routledge.</p>
<p>As editors, they will commission and edit a series of inter-disciplinary texts that will present critical thinking on significant health issues for researchers, practising health professionals and postgraduate students in health-related disciplines.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to be taking up this initiative as it relates well to our research agendas in the Critical Health Psychology Group at Massey,” says Professor Chamberlain.</p>
<p>“This will be the first major book series that will specifically consider health issues from a critical perspective. We plan to solicit texts that cover a diverse range of health topics and to have a strong stable of leading international authors contributing.”</p>
<p>The international series will take a wide-ranging approach to health, involving issues such as gender and health, obesity, medicalisation, palliative care, the use of health technologies, and the health issues of migrants and other marginalised groups.</p>
<p>Each volume in the series will provide a critical approach and will be relevant to students and practitioners across the social sciences.</p>
<p>Professor Chamberlain and Dr Lyons are authors of the major critical health psychology text Health Psychology: A Critical Introduction (Cambridge) and their research in critical health psychology has been published in a wide variety of international peer-reviewed journals.</p>
