<p>Candidate highlights CERA&#39;s &#39;dictatorial&#39; business acquisition</p>
<p>ACT candidate Gareth Veale today spoke out against the Christchurch Earthquake Rebuild Authority&#39;s compulsory acquisition of the Ministry Nightclub.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry has a twenty-year history as a popular warehouse music venue, attracting countless music lovers and students to the city centre,&quot; said Veale, who is standing in this week&#39;s Christchurch East by-election.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the earthquakes the owner has been working hard to re-plan, rebuild, and reopen the venue, at huge personal cost.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet now, CERA has decided, as they so often do, that they know best. They have effectively confiscated Ministry, paying the owner a nominal sum so that they can demolish the venue to make way for a bus station and other pet projects. They&#39;re even charging the owner demolition fees.</p>
<p>&quot;Locals now lack any decent-sized venue for gigs, and will be forced to travel to Wellington or Auckland to see their favourite acts live.</p>
<p>&quot;This is merely one example of CERA&#39;s dictatorial attitude towards the rebuilding of Christchurch - it&#39;s almost as though they are using the earthquakes as an excuse to reform the city according to their own preferences. The property rights of business owners and home owners in Christchurch are rarely considered as CERA pushes through its agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;The worst of it is, neither National or Labour are willing to strongly speak out against CERA&#39;s actions.</p>
<p>&quot;If Christchurch home and business owners want to send a message to government that they want greater respect for property rights, they should vote for a party that has a history of standing up for those rights.</p>
<p>&quot;That party is ACT.&quot;</p>
