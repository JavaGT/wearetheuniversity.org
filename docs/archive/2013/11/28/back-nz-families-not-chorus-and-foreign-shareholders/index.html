<p><strong>Thursday, 28 November 2013, 3:14 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Tracey Martin MP<br>Spokesperson for Communications &amp; IT<br>28 November 2013</p>
<p>Back New Zealand Families, Not Chorus And Its Foreign Shareholders</p>
<p>New Zealand First is challenging the Government to back New Zealand families on copper broadband pricing, rather than surrendering to pressure from Chorus and its foreign shareholders.</p>
<p>Communications and IT spokesperson Tracey Martin says the Government is proposing to ignore the Commerce Commission’s final pricing recommendation to lower copper broadband prices and instead impose a higher price for copper broadband users.</p>
<p>Ms Martin says that Kiwi families will end up paying more than they should for their internet in another shonky deal crafted by the Government.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First supported the final recommendation from the Commerce Commission establishing lower copper broadband prices, and opposes any deal that puts the interests of a publicly listed company ahead of New Zealand families and businesses.</p>
<p>“We will vote against any legislation that seeks to overrule the Commerce Commission’s final pricing recommendation or that tries to delay its implementation from 1 December 2014.</p>
<p>“This Government has courted controversy with the Sky City Convention Centre, a multi-million dollar prop up for Rio Tinto, film subsidies for Warner Brothers, a bailout of South Canterbury Finance, and now it wants to set up yet another deal for their mates at Chorus rather than putting the interests of all New Zealanders first.</p>
<p>“Chorus made a profit of $171 million last year so to turn to its Government mates to ask for the taxpayer to provide them more money is simply outrageous,” says Ms Martin.</p>
