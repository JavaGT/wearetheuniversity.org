<p><strong>Green Party welcomes Bennett’s support for rental housing warrant of fitness</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party welcomes Social Development Minister Paula Bennett’s support for a warrant of fitness programme for all private landlords, and are calling on her cabinet colleagues to implement the programme, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>The Green Party campaigned in 2011 to institute a warrant of fitness programme for all rental accommodation as a key part of its measures to tackle child poverty. Earlier this year the Greens further expanded on this policy in its Home for Life housing announcement.</p>
<p>“The Green Party has long advocated for a warrant of fitness for all rental accommodation, so it is heartening to see the Social Development Minister come out in support of the policy,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>On TVNZ’s Q + A programme this morning, Minister Bennett said that she was an advocate for bringing in a warrant of fitness scheme and extending it out to all private landlords.</p>
<p>“It’s time for Minister Bennett’s fellow National Party colleagues to stop dragging chain and implement this policy which will make a huge difference to the lives of New Zealand children living in poverty,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
<p>“A warrant of fitness programme now has broad cross-party support, with the Labour Party recently coming out in support, and now a National Party Minister.</p>
<p>“This policy is overdue. Substandard rental houses are making our kids sick with debilitating conditions like asthma, rheumatic fever and glue ear.</p>
<p>“A warrant of fitness scheme to ensure warm healthy rentals will make positive change a reality for the hundreds of thousands of children living in cold, inefficient homes,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
