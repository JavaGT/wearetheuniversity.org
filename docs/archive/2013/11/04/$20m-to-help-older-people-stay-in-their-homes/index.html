<p><strong>Scott Simpson</strong><br><strong>MP For Coromandel</strong></p>
<p><strong>Media Release</strong><br><strong>04 November 2013</strong></p>
<p><strong>$20m to help older people stay in their homes</strong></p>
<p>Coromandel MP Scott Simpson has welcomed a $20 million funding boosts to help older New Zealanders stay in their own homes longer.</p>
<p>Waikato District Health Board is among nine health boards across the country which will receive additional finance to support older people who wish to continue living at home. The money will be targeted at individuals with more complex needs, for example those requiring more frequent assessments and more personal care hours.</p>
<p>“In terms of our population, Coromandel has the second highest proportion of seniors in the country so for our area this additional funding is hugely positive,” said Mr Simpson.</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s aging population is not news. But we also know older people are staying healthier and more active than ever. Often, with support, they can retain that independence for longer. This new funding will help provide more options for older people and their families when it comes to deciding where and how they would like to live.”</p>
<p>Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew said the funding will be distributed over the next four years and will be allocated to DHBs based on their share of the older population.</p>
