<p><strong>Monday, 18 November 2013, 6:21 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/AUT_University">AUT University</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Mobile social media, mobile technologies, production and aesthetics to be explored at MINA2013</strong></p>
<p>From November 18 to 22, AUT University will be the home of a series of events exploring mobile technologies in film, education, business and creativity.</p>
<p>The week begins with a two-day mobile filmmaking workshop, and moves into the third International Mobile Innovation Screenings and Mobile Creativity and Mobile Innovation Symposium for academics and industry.</p>
<p>The events are co-hosted by MINA (Mobile Innovation Network Aotearoa), Colab (AUT University) and School of Art &amp; Design (AUT University) in collaboration with the School of Design at the College of Creative Arts (Massey University, Wellington).</p>
<p>From November 18 – 19, MINA co-founders, Laurent Antonczak (AUT University) and Max Schleser (Massey University) will be leading an intensive workshop that will give an overview of the many styles and techniques used to create films using a mobile phone. Max and Laurent will explore the ideas, scripting, shooting and editing processes to enable participants to produce their own film; whether it&#39;s an educational video, experimental film or the next viral hit.</p>
<p>And to see how experts from around the world create stunning mobile clips, there will be two International Mobile Innovation Screenings on November 21 and 22. Films from right across the globe will be displayed, showing the amazing filmmaking that can be done just off a smartphone whether they are pocket films, mobile-mentaries or smartphones films.</p>

<p>Schleser and Antonczak, curators of the screenings and mobile filmmakers themselves, said the screening will open people’s eyes to the opportunities and technology they are carrying around in their pockets.</p>
<p>“Mobile filmmaking has been around for about a decade, but in the last two years we have seen a shift to HD camera technology that even allows slow-motion filmmaking and simultaneously filmmakers have completed short films all on smartphones using apps for editing. This opens up a new dimension for filmmaking,” says Schleser.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to host an international event in Auckland and to promote New Zealand knowledge and expertise within such eclectic mobile area,” says Antonczak.<br>ends</p>
