<p>University to host Titanium Conference</p>
<p>In partnership with the University of Waikato, the Titanium Industry Development Association (TiDA) will host the International Titanium Powder Processing, Consolidation and Metallurgy Conference in December in Hamilton.</p>
<p>The conference will promote titanium powder and processing, consolidation processes, alloy development and applications.</p>
<p>Keynote speaker Associate Professor Brian Gabbitas from the University’s Engineering Department is one of an international range of speakers who will present at the conference.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Gabbitas will deliver an overview paper on the titanium research the University has been carrying out over the past three years. The title of his paper is Thermo Mechanical Processing of Titanium and Titanium Alloys by Powder Metallurgy.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to commercialise the work that has already been done and therefore we have to look at processing titanium powder economically,” he says. “Research is being focused on economical production whilst maintaining good mechanical properties.”</p>
<p>Associate Professor Gabbitas says titanium can be used in place of stainless steel in many applications because it has good corrosion resistance properties and has the highest strength-to-weight ratio of all the engineering alloys. This makes titanium alloys attractive in applications where weight saving is important.</p>
<p>About 90 people are expected to attend the conference, with more than half of those coming from overseas. The conference runs from December 2-4 and is being held at the University of Waikato. For more information visit <a href="http://www.tida.co.nz">www.tida.co.nz</a> .<br>ends</p>
