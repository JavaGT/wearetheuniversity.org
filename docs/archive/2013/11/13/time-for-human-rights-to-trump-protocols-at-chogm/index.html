<p><strong>Time for human rights to trump protocols at CHOGM</strong></p>
<p>The Key Government is hiding behind Commonwealth protocols to avoid criticising the regime of Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa, Green Party human rights spokesperson Jan Logie said today.</p>
<p>As host of this Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting (CHOGM), Sri Lanka automatically becomes the chair in office of the Commonwealth for the following 2 years. The process has been followed ever since the role of chair in office was established in 1999. Despite this, any leader of a sovereign nation such as New Zealand could object to this occurring.</p>
<p>“John Key could quite easily at CHOGM issue a statement to the effect that New Zealand opposes Sri Lanka chairing the Commonwealth for the following two years,” said Ms Logie.</p>
<p>“Our Prime Minister could also lobby other countries in the Commonwealth who are concerned by the human rights situation in Sri Lanka to oppose Sri Lanka carrying on as chair.</p>
<p>“Just because a process has been followed since 1999 doesn’t mean New Zealand has to go along with that process.</p>
<p>“We are an independent nation.</p>
<p>“It is morally repugnant that a regime involved in war crimes is the nominal head of the Commonwealth for the next two years.</p>
<p>“Thousands of civilians were killed during the close of the civil war and as yet Sri Lanka refuses to investigate and prosecute those responsible for these war crimes.</p>
<p>“Sri Lanka is a country that has breached the Commonwealth’s own principles and New Zealand has so far been extremely weak in expressing any sort of censure.</p>
<p>“New Zealand needs to take a stand for human rights by doing all it can to stop Sri Lanka chairing the Commonwealth for the next two years.</p>
<p>“Even if this stand is unsuccessful it is far better to have tried to do something than nothing whatsoever,” said Ms Logie.</p>
