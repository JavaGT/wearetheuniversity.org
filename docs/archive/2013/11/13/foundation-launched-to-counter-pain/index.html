<p><strong>Foundation launched to counter pain</strong></p>
<p>PhD graduate Dr Giresh Kanji is set to fulfil a career ambition this month with the launch of The New Zealand Pain Foundation, a charitable organisation aimed at completing research and educating people with both physical and mental pain.</p>
<p>The Foundation, which will be formally launched in Wellington on Friday November 15, also aims for money raised via sponsorship to be used for research, supporting Masters postgraduate students AT Massey studying neck pain, back pain, obesity migraine and depression as well as providing funding for randomised control trials.</p>
<p>Foundation board of trustee member, Associate Professor Rachel Page from Massey’s College of Health, says the foundation has a particular point of difference with its health treatment goals.</p>
<p>“What is really different about this foundation is not relying on drugs as the means for treatment of pain but researching other methods of treatment/diagnosis for pain and associated conditions such as depression, obesity and insomnia.”</p>
<p>Dr Kanji, who is a qualified medical doctor specialising in muscoskeletal pain, graduated with a doctorate in Health Sciences from Massey University in May. The completion of his PhD coincided with the launch of the Sport and Pain Clinic, a venture that he founded that has benefited greatly from his studies and his quest to eliminate people’s pain.</p>
<p>“I wanted to find the cause of people’s pain and reduce their pain scores to zero (zero being no pain, ten being the worst pain imaginable). If a patient’s pain could not be eliminated I hoped to find its cause, as the most frustrating thing for patients is not knowing what is causing their pain.”</p>

<p>His PhD researching headache pain, undertaken at the Institute of Food Nutrition and Human Health, completes a trifecta of qualifications from Massey University, which also include a Postgraduate Diploma in Business Information and a Masters in Management.</p>
<p>He now plans to apply knowledge from all three degrees to the successful management of The New Zealand Pain Foundation.</p>
<p>His vision is that support for the foundation will enable it to build on his initial work by providing further insights into pain and researching a wide range of self treatments for common pain conditions.</p>
