<p><strong>Good IT infrastructure essential during organisational change</strong></p>
<p>New research has found that having adequate information technology (IT) infrastructure in place is critical to successful restructuring.</p>
<p>The investigation, carried out by Professor Benoit Aubert and Dr Val Hooper from Victoria University of Wellington’s School of Information Management, with co-researcher Anne-Marie Croteau from Concordia University in Canada, shows that firms with adequate IT infrastructure in place improve their performance after restructuring, while those without experience detrimental effects as a result of the organisational change.</p>
<p>“If your data and supporting infrastructure are well-organised and flexible, information will continue to flow effectively, even during a restructure—but to try and implement change with weak infrastructure is just shooting yourself in the foot,” says Professor Aubert.</p>
<p>“Part of it is a matter of effort and rigour in ensuring data and supporting processes are correct. It is not just the money a company pours into IT—at the core it is a management issue that large and small companies have to tackle,” he says.</p>
<p>“If data is wrong, poorly organised or not able to be shared, it won&#39;t help you—so even if a company has high-speed broadband, it won’t lead to increased productivity unless other key infrastructure components are there.”</p>
<p>Professor Aubert says essential technical infrastructure should be easy to upgrade or scale, enhance connectivity and be compatible for multiple platforms and interfaces.</p>

<p>Essential organisational infrastructure elements include policies, processes and ownership rules that ensure data remains accurate, unambiguous and able to be shared between different stakeholders; rules and standards to manage internal information flows and IT assets; and competent IT personnel who understand the business context of the organisation.<br>The research analysed survey data from 425 companies in New Zealand and Canada.</p>
