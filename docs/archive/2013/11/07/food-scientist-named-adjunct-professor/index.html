<p><strong>Thursday, November 7, 2013</strong><br><strong>Food scientist named Adjunct Professor</strong></p>
<p>Plant &amp; Food Research scientist Dr Roger Hurst has been appointed Adjunct Professor at Massey University.</p>
<p>Adjunct Professors are distinguished members of the community, recognised by Massey for their academic or professional qualifications, who are invited to carry out teaching and student supervision in their field of expertise.</p>
<p>Dr Hurst is Science Group Leader of the Food &amp; Wellness Group at Plant &amp; Food Research, a Crown Research Institute.</p>
<p>His group has a long-term and productive research collaboration with Massey’s Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health and the School of Sport and Exercise investigating the effects of berry fruit on gut health and exercise recovery/performance.</p>
<p>This appointment provides an additional link between Dr Hurst’s group and Massey.</p>
<p>Massey Professor in Nutritional Physiology Marlena Kruger says the appointment builds on an already strong relationship between Dr Hurst and the University.</p>
<p>“Dr Hurst brings significant expertise in the areas of health benefits by polyphenols from fruit and research areas of gut health and immunity,” she says. “He has a significant track record of being funded by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.</p>
<p>“Dr Hurst can contribute significantly to the postgraduate teaching in human nutrition as well as human physiology. He has demonstrated excellence in scholarship, personal achievement and has proven capacity and leadership in Foods for Health.”</p>
<p>Plant &amp; Food Research and Massey University are partners in FoodHQ, New Zealand’s international centre for collaborative food research that also includes AgResearch, Fonterra, the Riddet Institute and the BCC.</p>
