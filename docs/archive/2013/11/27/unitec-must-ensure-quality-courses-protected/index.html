<p><strong>Wednesday, 27 November 2013, 11:28 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Unitec must ensure quality courses protected</p>
<p>Unitec’s decision to make 50 design and visual arts department staff redundant raises serious concerns about the future quality of the highly regarded programme, Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Grant Robertson says.</p>
<p>“The loss of jobs will be tough on the staff. It appears there will only be 17 full-time positions in the restructured department which means many people will be without a job.</p>
<p>“The design and visual arts department at Unitec is well regarded and it is hard to understand what would justify the loss of those who have built that reputation.</p>
<p>“Unitec insists the restructuring is not about money, but about getting closer to industry and having more involvement from industry in the teaching process.</p>
<p>“It is important the programme has close links with industry, but that should not compromise the quality of teaching and the students’ experience.</p>
<p>“Students in the programme need an assurance from Unitec they will continue to receive quality teaching that develops skills which are applicable across the industry.</p>
<p>“With such dramatic staff cuts, and few full time staff remaining, there are serious questions to be answered about quality assurance for this programme.</p>
<p>“Design is an important part of a prosperous future New Zealand economy. We cannot afford to see the quality of programmes in this sector compromised,” Grant Robertson says.</p>
