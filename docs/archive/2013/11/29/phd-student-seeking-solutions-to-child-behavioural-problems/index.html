<p>UC health sciences PhD student seeking solutions to child behavioural problems</p>
<p>November 29, 2013</p>
<p>A University of Canterbury (UC) health sciences PhD student is investigating a different approach to finding solutions to child behavioural and emotional problems.</p>
<p>Studies have shown about five percent of New Zealand primary school children are anti-social and about 30 percent of seven-year-old children in Dunedin have been reported by their parents and their teachers with a high level of behavioural problems.</p>
<p>UC’s Vanessa Loh is working with parents of young children with behaviour problems. She is using a new play-based approach which is different from the usual interventions, and may be of significant interest to some parents and the community.</p>
<p>``Rather than the traditional behavioural approaches, I am applying parent-child play relationships to achieve self-directed changes in child behaviour.</p>
<p>``There is a direct connection between how children feel and how they behave. When children feel good about themselves, they will act and behave in the same way.</p>
<p>``Theorists emphasise that by using play to allow a child to feel heard, understood, cared about and accepted, they become more social and mature in their behaviour, which ultimately initiates self-responsible and co-operative behaviour.</p>
<p>``Child behavioural problems are regarded as a form of expression of deeper emotions or thoughts, which sometimes involve the child’s misunderstanding his or her parents’ intentions.</p>

<p>``Therefore, parents are trained to be the `play therapist’ for their children in order to identify the emotion and thought, and their meanings, by developing a therapeutic relationship with their children in home play sessions as well as in their daily living.</p>
<p>``Parents help their children to improve their self-worth, which ultimately initiates self-directed change and behavioural and emotional regulation in the children.</p>
<p>``My research project includes an individualised five-session family play-based programme. I have experience in counselling families with behavioural and emotional problems in their young children.’’</p>
<p>Loh is studying under the supervision of UC’s Associate Professor Kathleen Liberty and Associate Professor Karyn France.</p>
<p>Her project will be an experiential process for parents and children. Loh will provide a set of play session toys and a live demonstration of a child-centred play session with the child for each family.</p>
<p>To better support the families, some sessions can be carried out at the family home, if preferred. There is also a possibility of follow-up support. Parents who have concerns about the behavioural or emotional problems of their three to six year old children can contact Loh for more information about her research project.</p>
