<p><strong>New builds latest casualty of National’s failed housing policy</strong></p>
<p>A drop in the number of new building consents has blown a hole in the Government’s housing policy, Labour Leader David Cunliffe says.</p>
<p>Statistics out today show the seasonally adjusted number of new dwellings, excluding apartments, fell by 2.3 per cent in October.</p>
<p>“Just this week we had the Registered Master Builders Federation warning LVR lending restrictions were jeopardising thousands of new builds. Today we have confirmation.</p>
<p>“John Key indicated late last month that the Government was tracking consents week by week and said numbers were actually <a href="http://www.interest.co.nz/news/66950/key-says-auckland-building-consents-oct-1-start-high-lvr-limit-govt-puts-nz5-mln-americas">increasing in Auckland</a>. He was wrong.</p>
<p>“We have already seen first home buyers locked out of the Kiwi dream. Now we are seeing the Government and the Reserve Bank pulling in opposite directions.</p>
<p>“The Reserve Bank can’t be blamed for being concerned about financial stability. It has been pushed into a corner by National’s failure to get a grip on the housing crisis.</p>
<p>“Increasing the supply of affordable homes is vital.</p>
<p>“John Key and his Government didn’t think through the implications of LVRs. Now they should take responsibility for the collateral damage: First home buyers and a drop in building consent numbers.”</p>
