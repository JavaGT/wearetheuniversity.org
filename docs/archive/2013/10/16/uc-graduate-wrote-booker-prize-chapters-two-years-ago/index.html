<p>UC graduate wrote Booker Prize chapters while UC’s Writer in Residence two years ago</p>
<p>October 16, 2013</p>
<p>Christchurch-educated Eleanor Catton, who today won the prestigious Man Booker Prize, wrote chapters of the award-winning book The Luminaries while Writer in Residence at the University of Canterbury (UC) in 2011.</p>
<p>Catton has, at 28, become the youngest author to ever win the award. Her novel, The Luminaries, is set in 1866 gold-rush Hokitika. She is the second New Zealander to win the Booker, with Keri Hulme winning in 1985 for The Bone People.</p>
<p>UC’s Acting Head of English, Christina Stachurski, says Catton received her Bachelor of Arts degree at UC after three years of study in 2005.</p>
<p>``We recognised Ellie as a writer of some exceptional talent and she was appointed Writer in Residence in 2011 when she wrote chapters of The Luminaries while based here on campus.</p>
<p>``Keri Hulme, was also UC’s Writer in Residence here on campus when she won her prize for The Bone People, so that’s a remarkable achievement for our Department and for UC.</p>
<p>``But today we are just so proud of Ellie. She worked in an office down the hallway here. She is a lovely person, unpretentious and fun to have around. Her father, Dr Phillip Catton, was a senior lecturer in philosophy here too,’’ Stachurski says.</p>
<p>Eleanor Catton was today presented with the award, one of the world&#39;s highest literary prizes, by the Duchess of Cornwall during a ceremony at the Guildhall in London.</p>
