<p>Victoria University congratulates graduate Eleanor Catton whose novel <em>The Luminaries</em> has won the prestigious Man Booker Prize 2013 announced this morning.</p>
<p>At 28, Ms Catton is the youngest person ever to have been awarded the prize. <em>The Luminaries</em>, her second novel, was up against works by well-established writers such as Colm Toibin, Jim Crace and Jhumpa Lahiri.</p>
<p>In 2007 Ms Catton completed the Master of Arts in Creative Writing from Victoria University’s International Institute of Modern letters at Victoria University of Wellington. <em>The Luminaries</em> and Ms Catton’s first novel <em>The Rehearsal</em> are both published by Victoria University Press.</p>
<p>Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says the University is immensely proud of Ms Catton’s achievement.</p>
<p>“It is an outstanding achievement for Eleanor, for Victoria University and for New Zealand literature. It is also a testament to the calibre of the creative writing and publishing capability at Victoria.”<br>Ms Catton’s New Zealand publisher, Fergus Barrowman of Victoria University Press, who attended the prize ceremony at Guildhall in London, says he is thrilled at Ms Catton’s triumph.</p>
<p>“We are delighted for Ellie and for the further international recognition the Man Booker Prize will bring <em>The Luminaries</em>. It’s a big ambitious book written by a fearlessly intelligent and talented writer. It’s a novel for readers who love great storytelling and it’s wonderful that the judges have chosen to recognise that with this illustrious prize.”</p>

<p>Victoria University Press say the book has been selling extremely well since and is now onto its fifth print run.</p>
<p><em>The Luminaries</em> is a West Coast gold-rush murder story, set in Hokitika in the 1860s. It is wide in scope with a large cast of characters and a richly patterned structure which stretches over 848 pages.</p>
<p><em>The Luminaries</em> was published in August 2013 and quickly achieved tremendous international critical success which has been topped off by the 2013 Man Booker Prize win.</p>
