<p><strong>One man band leads Pasifika concert</strong></p>
<p>Pasifika music coordinator at Te Kōkī New Zealand School of Music, Opeloge Ah Sam, has a pivotal role at this weekend’s “We are Pasifika” concert marking 20 years of the Manukau Symphony Orchestra.</p>
<p>In what could almost be described as a one-man band role, he is an adviser, scriptwriter, lyricist, arranger, and composer of the concert that celebrates South Auckland’s Pasifika community within an orchestral context.</p>
<p>The concert involves 12 orchestral pieces, performed by 85 players in the orchestra backed by 11 choirs.</p>
<p>Mr Ah Sam was determined to ensure that the concert would be representative and significant and not conform to easy stereotypes.</p>
<p>“All too often ‘Pasifika’ is focused around Samoa, Tongan and Fijian cultures,” he says.</p>
<p>“I wanted it to be more representative of the entire Pasifika community and so, for example, 11 Pacific languages are used within the texts. I’ve included three ‘Western’ arias – because they say something valid about the way Pacific people express themselves musically.”</p>
<p>Mr Ah Sam, who teaches at Massey’s Wellington campus, says the experience is connected to his PhD topic <em>Modern Expressions of Samoan Identity through Music Composition.</em> “It’s really about access and finding other ways of expressing ourselves musically as Pacific people in modern ‘Western’ society, and how to do this in a respectful manner so that both parties go away having gained something from each other.”</p>
<p><strong><em>We are Pasifika</em> will be held on October 19 at the Vodafone Events Centre, 770 Great South Road, Manukau, Auckland. Tickets are available on TicketDirect.</strong></p>
