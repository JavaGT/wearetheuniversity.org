<p><strong>Tuesday, October 15, 2013</strong><br><strong>Massey team wins Engineers Without Borders challenge</strong></p>
<p>A team of Massey University engineering students has won the top award in this year’s Engineers Without Borders New Zealand University Challenge.</p>
<p>David Mountain and Akshay Kumar, from Massey’s Albany campus, beat teams from Massey’s Manawatu campus, Canterbury and AUT Universities in last night’s final in Auckland.</p>
<p>The competition for first-year university students uses a team-based design approach focused on community-based sustainable development projects. This year, teams were asked to meet some of the engineering challenges faced by communities in Timor Leste.</p>
<p>The Albany team focused on the problem of housing design in the town of Codo, in the Lautem District of Timor Leste, which is susceptible to extreme weather. They designed a long-lasting roofing system that is easy to construct and resistant to high winds, heavy rain and possible earthquakes. To do this, they employed materials easily found nearby to design a bamboo and used tyre roof that can stand up to the elements better than other designs. It is also cheaply made and easily installed.</p>
<p>The team from the Manawatū campus, comprising Matthew Bridle, Nathan Hickey and Samuel Nepia, looked at the issue of water supply and quality in the same town. The team designed a water cart and a chlorination agent to remedy these issues. The cart was of a robust design to suit the rough landscape around the village, while chlorination provides a quick way for the water to be cleaned, ready for drinking and cooking.</p>

<p>School of Engineering and Advanced Technology Professor of Product Development Allan Anderson says it is a “great achievement for Massey and a credit to all the students involved and to the course coordinators, supervisors and mentors on both campuses”.</p>
<p>He says the challenge gives first-year students the opportunity to solve real-world problems. &quot;Project-based learning is key to what we do at Massey and this particular challenge makes the teams work together to come up with solutions that will actually make a difference. The Engineers Without Borders project is especially beneficial as it encourages the students to consider the cultural, social, environmental and economic impact of their engineering solution.”</p>
<p>The winning team will go on to represent New Zealand at the Australian challenge finals in Melbourne in December.</p>
