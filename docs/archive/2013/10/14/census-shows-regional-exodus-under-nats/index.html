<p><strong>Census shows regional exodus under Nats</strong></p>
<p>Census data being released tomorrow will depict a widespread exodus from the regions as provincial New Zealanders flee small towns forgotten by the National Government, Labour Leader and Regional Development spokesperson David Cunliffe says.</p>
<p>“Labour understands data being released tomorrow will show Kiwis are leaving towns that have been gutted by the hands off approach of this National Government.</p>
<p>“Something must be done to turn around the compounding effect on our regions of an aging population and a loss of opportunities.</p>
<p>“Job losses, factory closures, government cut backs and the shutting of branch offices have left people in the regions with no choice but to leave in droves.</p>
<p>“Manufacturing is stagnating, economic development has been limited to glossy brochures and a few roads, mortgage restrictions are being unfairly applied to the provinces and tax biases are driving money from the regions into the Auckland property market.</p>
<p>“More than 27,000 people from Waikato have moved to Australia since the last Census, 22,600 from the Bay of Plenty and 11,500 from Northland.</p>
<p>“Over the same period 4,800 workers have lost their jobs in the Manawatu-Wanganui region, 4,700 in Otago and 3,400 in Gisborne-Hawkes Bay. Meanwhile, real median weekly incomes have dropped since the last Census by $45 in Southland, $50 in Waikato and $24 in Taranaki.</p>
<p>“A Labour government will revitalise our manufacturing and export industries and breathe life back into provincial New Zealand. We will be a hands-on government which will work with regional New Zealand to get the best out of our provinces.</p>
<p>“A Labour government will harness our innovation potential and can-do attitude by funding research and development and creating a value-added economy which benefits all New Zealanders,” David Cunliffe says.</p>
