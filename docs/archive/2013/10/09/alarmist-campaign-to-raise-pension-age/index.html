<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters<br>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>9 October 2013</p>
<p><strong>Alarmist Campaign to Raise Pension Age</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First has again warned against the concerted campaign to soften up the public to fundamental changes to the New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) scheme.</p>
<p>This follows the draft recommendations from the Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement calling for a debate on raising the age of eligibility, along with changing the formula to which NZS payments are decided.</p>
<p>Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters says that it is clear the campaign has a number of fronts and protagonists but the overall intent is obvious.</p>
<p>“It is to smash and destroy the wide consensus that has developed among New Zealanders on the broad parameters for superannuation.</p>
<p>“Raising the pension age is a quick fix to a ‘crisis’ created by those promoting the private pensions industry. At only 4.3 per cent of GDP, NZS is far more affordable than many OECD countries, where it can be up to 8 per cent of GDP.</p>
<p>“The issue is not the age of eligibility. The National Government stopped paying into the New Zealand Superannuation Fund in 2009, a seriously short-sighted move, with the Finance Minister not expecting payments to resume again until 2020/21.</p>
<p>“Full superannuation is also paid to more than 42,000 migrants who have been here for at least 10 years – even if they have made little or no contribution to the economy.</p>
<p>“In our view the best way to meet future pension liabilities is to get serious growth back into our economy and to take a closer look at who we actually allow to collect New Zealand Superannuation”, says Mr Peters.</p>
