<p><strong>Time to leave Phillipstown in peace</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party welcomes today’s High Court ruling that the decision to close Phillipstown school was unlawful, and urges the Minister not to challenge the decision and leave the community in peace, Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said today.</p>
<p>The High Court in Christchurch has today ruled that Education Minister Hekia Parata’s decision to close Phillipstown School is unlawful, because the consultation process failed to meet the requirements of the Education Act.</p>
<p>“Today’s decision is great news for the students, parents, teachers and the community in Philipstown, who have fought so hard to keep their school open,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
<p>“This ruling is a further indictment on Hekia Parata’s poor performance as Education Minister.”</p>
<p>This is now the second High Court ruling overturning the Minister’s decision to close a school. Her decision to close Salisbury School in Nelson was also subject to a judicial review in December 2012 and was ruled unlawful as well.</p>
<p>“Judicial review is a check on proper process, and clearly she’s failed at that,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
<p>“It is time for the Government to stop putting the children and families of Christchurch through this stress and keep Phillipstown school open.</p>
<p>“Christchurch East needs good schools with good community support. Phillipstown School has a strong roll, a strong community and operates as a hub in their area. There is no justification for this closure.</p>
<p>“Hekia Parata needs to move on and not challenge this decision. This community deserves support, not further uncertainty.”</p>
