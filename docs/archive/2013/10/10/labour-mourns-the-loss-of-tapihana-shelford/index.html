<p><strong>Labour mourns the loss of Tapihana Shelford</strong></p>
<p><em>E rere i runga i nga parirau o Tawhirimatea haere i runga i te ara o nga rangatira o nga kingi me te rawa kore haere atu ra haere oti atu e ...</em></p>
<p>“The New Zealand Labour Party extends its deep sympathy to the family of Tapihana Shelford, a friend and committed stalwart,” Hauraki-Waikato MP Nanaia Mahuta said.</p>
<p>“Tapihana was hugely respected throughout New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The great-grandson of Paraire Karaka Paikea and grandson of Tapihana Paraire Paikea, both of whom represented Northern Maori, he initiated the Morehu Youth Movement and was a keen advocate for rangatahi and their contribution to the Ratana Movement.</p>
<p>“He was mentored and inspired by the late Te Reo Hura and Dame Te Atairangikaahu.</p>
<p>“Tapihana forged alliances between Te Iwi Morehu and Labour by creating numerous opportunities to discuss the relevance of Te Tiriti O Waitangi, a legacy set out by Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana and continued by Tapihana’s grandfather.</p>
<p>“He was well-versed on matters pertaining to the Ratana movement and he was a confident orator who understood the important relationships that connected Morehu to iwi throughout the country.</p>
<p>“Considered a diplomat and a gentleman by all who knew him, Tapihana provided constant support and advice to former Labour Prime Minister Helen Clark. More recently, he was instrumental in spearheading a renewed relationship between Ratana and the Labour Party.</p>
<p>“Tapihana was passionate about progress for his people in Te Uri o Hau along the Kaipara harbour.”</p>

<p>“As we mourn his loss we remember his contribution, he was a gentle giant of a man who served his people with solid determination to see the betterment of the Maori people,” Nanaia Mahuta said.</p>
<p><em>Noreira e te rangatira, haere ki o matua tupuna. Haere ki te torona o Ihoa. Takoto pai mai e te hoa, e te rangatira.</em></p>
<p>A contingent of Labour MPs will attend Tapihana Shelford’s tangi at Otamatea on Sunday.</p>
