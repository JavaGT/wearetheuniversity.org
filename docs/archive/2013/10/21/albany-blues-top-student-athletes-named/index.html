<p>World surf lifesaving champion and swimmer Laura Quilter and hockey player Hugo Inglis were named the sportswoman and man of the year at the BNZ Albany Blues Awards last night.</p>
<p>The Blues Awards, presented in association with BNZ, are awarded to students in recognition of their outstanding achievements in both sport and academic studies. Previous recipients include Hamish Bond, Lisa Carrington, Simon Child and Juliette Haigh.</p>
<p>Ms Quilter is studying towards a Bachelor of Communications and was a member of the New Zealand team that competed and won the world rescue championships in surf lifesaving in Adelaide in November. The 4x50 metre obstacle relay team won gold and set a new world record, and Ms Quilter gained an individual bronze in the 50 metre manikin carry. She is the Auckland Women’s 100 metre backstroke champion, for which she received the Jean Ponder Memorial Shield, and competed in the World University Games in Russia in July.</p>
<p>Mr Inglis is a fourth-year student studying towards a Bachelor of Business Studies, majoring in Finance with a minor in Politics. He has played 107 international tests for the New Zealand men’s hockey team, debuting in 2009. He also played at the London Olympics in 2012. Mr Inglis was part of the New Zealand men’s team that reached the semi-finals of the World Hockey League, eventually placing fourth. They were also fourth in the Azlan Shah Cup.</p>
