<p>United stand needed against National attacks on universities</p>
<p>As the University of Auckland Council meets to set fees today it is important that the university sector unites to combat attacks being driven by Steven Joyce and the National government, Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Grant Robertson says.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce’s time as Tertiary Minister has seen consistent under-funding of universities and persistent cuts to allowances and loans.</p>
<p>“His latest plan involves removing the student and staff voice from University Councils.</p>
<p>“This is a concerted, anti-democratic agenda that undermines the very values that universities stand for.</p>
<p>“The response from institutions, staff and students must be unified - to show Mr Joyce that his agenda will not be accepted.</p>
<p>“National’s cuts will mean increasing numbers of New Zealanders will miss out on tertiary education or go further into debt. This is short-sighted, adds to inequality, and limits not only the potential of individuals but the country as a whole. Education is not a cost to be cut as Mr Joyce sees it, but an essential investment in our future.</p>
<p>“At the fee setting meeting today it will once again be students who will be putting the case about the impact of fee rises. Student and staff representatives play a vital role in ensuring that Councils understand the impact of these decisions on the university as a whole.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce’s plan to take away their automatic right to representation at the Council table is anti-democratic and wrong. Labour opposes these changes and will reverse them if they are passed into law before the election.</p>
<p>“Labour wants to work with Councils, staff and students to develop a quality, accessible and affordable tertiary education system.</p>
<p>“The University of Auckland Council has the opportunity today to send a message to the government that its approach is wrong. By doing that it will also be protecting the rights of students and staff to be heard on critical issues,” Grant Robertson said.<br>ends</p>
