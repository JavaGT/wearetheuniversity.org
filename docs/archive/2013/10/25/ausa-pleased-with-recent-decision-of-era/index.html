<p><strong>Friday, 25 October 2013, 4:47 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_Students_Association">Auckland University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>AUSA pleased with recent decision of Employment Relations Authority.</strong></p>
<p>Press Release<br>25th October 2013<br>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>The Auckland University Students’ Association is pleased with the decision of the Employment Relations Authority regarding its actions in ending the employment of its former General Manager, Tom O’Connor.</p>
<p>In June, the 2012 AUSA President Arena Williams, 2013 AUSA President Daniel Haines and 2014 AUSA President Cate Bell all gave evidence in AUSA&#39;s defence of dismissing Tom O&#39;Connor.</p>
<p>Daniel Haines, current AUSA President said “We were firmly of the belief that we needed to take action to protect the interests of students and the Association, and the Authority has agreed that our actions were appropriate. No employer wants to have to take such action, but we are pleased to be vindicated.”</p>
<p>The Association no longer employs a General Manager and has changed its structure to ensure that the Association can continue to provide strong advocacy and services for and on behalf of students.</p>
