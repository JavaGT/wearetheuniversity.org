<p><strong>Sharing the stage with Lorde</strong></p>
<p>He may not be as well known as a certain Ella Yelich-O’Connor, aka Lorde, but University of Waikato senior lecturer Te Kahautu Maxwell got to share the limelight with the chart-topping pop star during the APRA Silver Scroll Awards in Auckland on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>While Lorde won the big award, the Silver Scroll, for her hit song <em>Royals</em>, Te Kahautu picked up the APRA Maioha Award, celebrating contemporary Māori music, for the song <em>Ruaimoko</em>, which was performed by his niece Maisey Rika –a University of Waikato alumna - and Anika Moa.</p>
<p>Te Kahautu - Te Whakatōhea, Te Whānau ā-Apanui, Ngāi Tai, Ngāti Awa, Tuhoe, Ngāti Porou and Ngāti Maniapoto - wrote the song while Mahuia Bridgman-Cooper composed the music.</p>
<p>Te Kahautu says the song was a lament written after the devastating 2011 Christchurch earthquake.<br>“That inspired me to write the song, that’s what it’s about, the Maori god of earthquakes and eruptions. I composed a song about what he was doing, devastating Christchurch. It’s a lament and pays tribute to the people who lost their lives and what the residents of Christchurch were going through, being homeless and displaced.”</p>
<p>He had largely forgotten about the song until he was invited to the awards evening.<br>“I thought I was going there just to support my niece,” he says.<br>“I didn’t even know I was up for an award.”<br>“It was a bit of a shock really. I don’t really listen to songs I’ve written so I just went for Maisey.”<br>While the win was totally unexpected, it’s not the first song Te Kahautu has written.</p>
<p>He is an expert in tikanga Māori and has a strong background in the performing arts, as a composer of haka, mōteatea, waiata-ā-ringa and poi, but <em>Ruaimoko</em> was his first foray into contemporary music.<br>And quite a successful foray, as it turns out.<br>“I’m quite impressed really,” he says.<br>So are we.</p>
