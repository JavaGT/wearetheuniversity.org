<p><strong>Mental Wellbeing for Young People is Essential</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is urging the Government to provide substantial support for young people and their mental wellbeing.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Association of Counsellors has revealed that there is a shortage of counsellors available for young people to talk to when they are having problems.</p>
<p>Social policy spokesperson Asenati Lole-Taylor says the Government needs to immediately address the inadequate student counsellor ratio within schools, in order to protect and promote the mental wellbeing of young people.</p>
<p>“Counsellors are the first point of contact for many young people who want to discuss and seek advice on issues that affect them.</p>
<p>“Support mechanisms and resources need to be accessible for young people so that help is readily available when they need it.</p>
<p>“It’s much better to have a fence at the top of the cliff, rather than an ambulance waiting at the bottom.</p>
<p>“In the 2011/2012 financial year period, 91 young people aged between 10-19 years old took their own lives.</p>
<p>“Far too many young people are leaving us too soon, and the Government should do their utmost best to ensure that student counsellor ratios and resources are up to standard”, says Mrs Lole-Taylor.</p>
