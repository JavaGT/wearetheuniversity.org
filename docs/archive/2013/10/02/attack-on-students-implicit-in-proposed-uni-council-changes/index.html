<p><strong><em>For Immediate Release</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Attack on students implicit in proposed university council changes</strong></p>
<p>“The government is attacking student representation on university councils,” said OUSA President Francisco in response to the release of the Review of the Legislative Settings for University Governance today.</p>
<p>“This is faith-based policy that fails to show any evidence of problems caused by the current mixed representation and skills model of university governance. It would be more credible if the Minister provided even just one example of the problems of the current model that includes students. Students’ expectations are that a substantial case ought to be constructed if there is to be a change.”</p>
<p>“This report has the whiff of an all-nighter pulled to crank out a forgotten piece of assessment. This isn’t even a C- job. It is an anaemic anonymous 11 page document that compares poorly with the comprehensive Review of Tertiary Education Governance conducted by Professor Meredith Edwards the Director the National Institute for Governance of the University of Canberra in 2003”.</p>
<p>“Professor Edwards’ review said there were no significant problems in institutional governance but that several areas for improvement were identified in many areas. That review considered that ‘Good governance is about both achieving desired results and achieving them in the right way.’ Part of good governance is stakeholder inclusion, like students.”</p>

<p>“The New Zealand tertiary education system, under current governance arrangements has produced more qualifications and graduates than ever before. Or so announced the Minister yesterday. It is difficult to reconcile the ‘we’re doing a great job’ story line with the ‘the governance of universities needs to change’ story line”, said Mr Hernandez.</p>
<p>“Māori expect good representation as a natural part of good governance”, said Gianna Leoni, the Tumuaki of Te Roopū Māori. “The number of Māori students have increased at this university making it even more important these gains are sustained with Māori and student voices in governance. We will be making our expectations heard.” said Ms. Leoni.</p>
<p>“Students are increasingly, the customers, consumers and co-producers of their education. The current paper relies on the Minister having some discussions with vice-chancellors and chancellors, and taking no account of student or other stakeholder views. This is not the approach that students or the university would consider good practice,” said Mr Hernandez.</p>
