<p>Early childhood education hui to showcase quality learning</p>
<p>Ensuring continued high quality early childhood education in the face of government cuts to the sector will be the focus of a two-day hui in Auckland.</p>
<p>The hui, organised by NZEI Te Riu Roa starts tomorrow (Friday 18 October).</p>
<p>It will showcase some of the best practice in early childhood education and bring together many key practitioners and early childhood education experts from around the country.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa early childhood representative Sarah Schubert says this is about trying to ensure we maintain “five-star” quality education for children in their early years because this is the best education investment that any government can make. This is particularly important for children who are vulnerable.</p>
<p>Research shows that qualified teachers are key to ensuring quality education.</p>
<p>However, she says that funding cuts to early childhood education have meant that many kindergartens and community-run centres are now struggling to retain qualified staff.</p>
<p>“Kindergartens and centres have committed to retaining 100 per cent qualified teachers because that is the best way to ensure that children get quality early childhood education.</p>
<p>But that’s becoming increasingly difficult because in 2010 the Government decided to reduce kindergarten funding to the level of only 80 per cent qualified teaching.</p>
<p>This has meant that kindergartens and centres are struggling to raise money in the community and parents are faced with increased costs. And this is particularly difficult for communities in poorer areas.</p>

<p>Sarah Schubert says it has now reached the point where the funding shortfall is having an impact on quality.</p>
<p>“Professional development for teachers is one casualty and we’re also starting to see kindergartens opting for other measures such as employing unqualified relievers.”</p>
<p>However she says the focus of this hui is to ensure that successful practice is shared and developed.</p>
<p>Across the education sector, collegiality and opportunities such as this for learning and sharing best practice are vital for quality education.</p>
<p>Keynote speakers include Professor Richie Poulton, Director of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Research Unit, which conducts the Dunedin longitudinal study, one of the most detailed studies of human health and development ever undertaken.</p>
<p>He’ll talk on the importance of the ECE sector for New Zealand’s future.</p>
<p>Another keynote speaker is Anne Smith, Emeritus Professor from the University of Otago’s College of Education. She specialises in childhood studies and children’s rights and has been involved in research, advocacy, and policy-making on childhood issues in New Zealand for almost 40 years.</p>
