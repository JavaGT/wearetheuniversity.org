<p>Police seek information after Harewood assault</p>
<p>Tuesday, 22 October 2013 - 3:46pm</p>
<p>Canterbury</p>
<p>Christchurch Police are appealing for information after a woman was assaulted at a Harewood Park early yesterday morning.</p>
<p>The incident occurred at around 2.30am yesterday [Monday 21 October] at Nunweek Park.</p>
<p>Detective Sergeant Richard Quested says a woman aged in her twenties parked her car on Wooldridge Road, outside the park, in order to use the toilet.</p>
<p>&quot;She found the toilets were locked and was walking back to her car when she was attacked from behind,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;The woman was pushed to the ground, head butted and hit in the face. While on the ground her attacker has attempted to sexually assault the woman, but was disturbed by a passing street sweeping machine.</p>
<p>&quot;The woman clawed at the man&#39;s face and pushed him off, and was able to run back to her car and drive away.</p>
<p>&quot;She has suffered cuts and bruises but fortunately was not seriously injured.&quot;</p>
<p>The offender is described as being between approximately 167cm (5ft 6in) and 177 (5ft 10in) tall, of medium build with a &#39;beer belly&#39; and a moustache. He was believed to be wearing a black cap with a black hoodie pulled up over the cap.</p>
<p>Detective Sergeant Quested says Police are appealing for any information from members of the public who may have been in the area at the time.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to hear from anyone who was driving through or in the vicinity of Nunweek Park between 2 and 3am on Monday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;If anyone has seen a man of this description, or any other suspicious people or activity around the park, we urge them to contact Police as soon as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Anyone with information is asked to contact Constable Pamela Cox on (03) 3725710 or Christchurch police on (03) 3637400.</p>
<p>Alternatively, to provide information anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
