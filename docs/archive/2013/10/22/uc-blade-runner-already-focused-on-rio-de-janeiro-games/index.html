<p><strong>UC blade runner already focused on Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro</strong></p>
<p><strong>October 22, 2013</strong></p>
<p>With just his first weekend in training behind him, University of Canterbury (UC) blade-running student Liam Malone is already fine tuning and focusing on qualifying for the Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in September 2016.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old UC commerce student, who lost both legs at the age of two, has been trialing his first ever pair of running-blades in a bid to become New Zealand&#39;s most successful sprinter at the next Paralympics.</p>
<p>``My goal is to reach Rio. That is my focus. To define what it would take to win the gold at this stage is difficult. It is definitely possible but I need to focus on building my platform to develop day by day.<br>That&#39;s how I work.</p>
<p>``But I believe it&#39;s realistic for me to be the best and I have the potential to be the best. But realism and potential don&#39;t win medals. Hard work does and that&#39;s what I have to do before I go anywhere.</p>
<p>``A lot of work will need to be done to qualify for Rio. There are the world champs in 2015, and, to qualify, I need to gain sufficient world rankings by competing in certain events. A huge amount of focus will go into getting out of the blocks as fast as fast as possible, as a bilateral amputee sprinter that&#39;s where my time will be lost or gained. </p>
<p>``Developing strength and power in my hamstrings, quads and glutes to be able to put as much energy into the blades, so in return I get the maximum amount of drive out of each step. </p>

<p>``The quality of technology among para-athletes is so even it will come down to the minor elements on the day and a lot of mental focus.’’ </p>
<p>Malone is working this week on his prosthesis, making adjustments to the sockets which fit to the blades. He is the only known bilateral amputee sprinter in the country. See a YouTube interview on his first day of training here: <a href="http://youtu.be/Dxw6TuLOrxI">http://youtu.be/Dxw6TuLOrxI</a>.</p>
<p>The Wellington athletics championship in March will be his first competitive event on the blades. He will compete in the sprints and relay against able-bodied athletes as much as he can.</p>
<p>Malone says he has been overwhelmed by support from UC Sport run by Grant Robertson.</p>
<p>``Grant has developed a programme to begin developing my strength, power and speed. I&#39;ve also attended UC sports psychology seminars. They have set up slow motion cameras to help with the analysis of aligning the blades to the sockets. </p>
<p>``UC has been fantastic. What is special about UC is the communal identity that everyone&#39;s so connected. This is a great place to study. The abundance of societies is truly awesome. The library is a pretty cool place too. The first time I went to the library I was overwhelmed by the sheer size of it.</p>
<p>``Rochester and Rutherford Hall has been incredible. I&#39;ve made friends there who will remain friends forever. Being part of the rebuil  </p>
