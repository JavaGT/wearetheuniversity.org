<h5>University of Waikato student Tracey Burgess-Jones will graduate this month with a PhD.</h5>
<p>It will be the third time she’s graduated from the University of Waikato, but PhD student Tracey Burgess-Jones wouldn’t miss it for the world.</p>
<p>“Graduation is a real recognition of what you’ve achieved, and it’s easy to underestimate the power of that. Graduation is a full-stop in my studies, a validation that I set myself a goal, and achieved it.”</p>
<p>In 1999 Tracey began a course of study that has culminated in a PhD. She has a Bachelor of Science in Biology, and a Master of Science in Biology, studying the population genetics of sea-grass.</p>
<p>This year she will graduate with her PhD, which has taken her to some chilly places she never imagined going to study lichens.</p>
<p>After being awarded an Antarctica Scholarship, Tracey made several trips down to the ice where she carried out research on lichens in temperatures as low as -30C.</p>
<p>“The air is different. The landscape is so huge. It’s hard to put words on what it is that is so addictive about Antarctica,” she says. “It’s a sensory deprivation and sensory overload at the same time.”</p>
<p>As part of the Antarctic scholarship, Antarctica New Zealand provided logistical support, flights, accommodation at Scott Base, field gear, tents, food, clothing, helicopter support and safety personnel in the field. Helicopter New Zealand provided a stipend.</p>

<p>Now complete, her PhD thesis is titled Population Genetics and Photobiont Selectivity in Antarctic Lichens.</p>
<p>The mother of two daughters aged five and 25 says that it’s been about trying to achieve harmony between study and other aspects of her life.</p>
<p>“Finding the balance between being the kind of parent I needed to be while still maintaining a high work output has taken a lot of effort.</p>
<p>“While studying I’ve got married, had another daughter, done renovations, had some health setbacks and bought a lifestyle block. Just because you’re studying, doesn’t mean the rest of your life stops. You just have to make it all work together.”</p>
<p>Tracey will graduate at Claudelands Events Centre at 2pm on 14 October.</p>
