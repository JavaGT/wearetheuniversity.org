<p>Puppets of Darkness Take Over</p>
<p>&quot;By the pricking of our thumbs...&quot;</p>
<p>This October sees a new adaptation of Shakespeare&#39;s tragedy of over-weening ambition, Macbeth, brought to the stage by Victoria University of Wellington performance club, Dionysiac. This production focuses strongly on the eponymous character and his wife. Director, and script editor, Neal Barber anchors his production in the way the witches treat the Macbeths are their puppets. &quot;Instead of seeing the witches as bit players who stop by every now and then to make sure the seeds of their prophecies are finding fertile ground, we have the witches constantly watering those seeds to ensure proper flourishing&quot; says Mr Barber of the concept.</p>
<p>Changing the focus allows the production to work with just seven actors. &quot;The first things to go were all the minor characters and sub-plots.&quot; Any characters lucky enough to survive Mr Barber&#39;s axe are all played by the witches who, quite literally, construct the world in which the Macbeths are immersed. &quot;The action is much more direct with a much larger percentage devoted to watching the Macbeths&#39; relationship unfold rather dallying on irritating sub-plots about the equivocatory powers of wine or that the English are &#39;liberating&#39; Scotland from a nasty, naughty man.&quot; Our actions are not our own when the agents of malevolence control the way we see the world.</p>
<p>About Dionysiac</p>
<p>Dionysiac is an Incorporated Society formed in March 2013. It was started by a group of current students at Victoria University of Wellington with a couple of the University&#39;s Alumni. Dionysiac aims to allow members to improve their performance skills by participating in productions presented for the public&#39;s enjoyment. Macbeth is Dionysiac&#39;s first production.</p>
<p>About the Creatives</p>
<p>Neal Barber - Director: Neal graduated with a BA (Hons) in English and a PGDipArts in Theatre Studies from the University of Otago and is currently studying towards his PGDipIS at VUW. During his undergraduate, he directed productions at the Globe and Fortune Theatres in Dunedin and for Spectrum Theatre at the University of Virginia. His directing highlights include the New Zealand Premiere of Claire by C.E.

This production is not only Neal&#39;s debut directing for Dionysiac but also in Wellington...</p>
<p>Taryn Meltzer - Movement Director: Taryn has been dancing all her life in a variety of styles, but for the last eight years she has focused on belly dance. While she has been involved in a variety of productions as a dancer, singer, and actor Macbeth is her first opportunity to be part of the production team, focusing on mood, choreography, and general witchy creepiness. She has very much enjoyed pushing actors around while muttering about animal spirits and leading from the shoulder blades.</p>
