<p><strong>Poroporoāki mo Vapnierka (Vapi) Kupenga</strong></p>
<p><em>Aue e te tuahine, kua ngaro atu koe i tenei ao</em><br><em>Hoki atu ki tua o te ārai</em><br><em>Hoki atu ki ōu tupuna</em><br><em>Moe mai i runga i tō moenga roa e hine, moe mai, moe mai, moe mai rā</em></p>
<p>It is with sadness that the Māori Party farewell the vivacious and staunch daughter of Ngāti Porou, Vapi Kupenga.</p>
<p>“Vapi was an amazing woman. She is well known for her aroha for people, her tireless advocacy for Maori, and for her particular Ngāti Porou flair,” said Tariana Turia.</p>
<p>“She was never afraid to speak her mind. She had a sharp intellect, and an equally sharp tongue, but you always knew where you stood with her, and that is a quality I always admired.”</p>
<p>Dr. Pita Sharples said “Vapi walked in so many different spaces with ease and confidence. She has been a secondary school teacher, a University lecturer, a broadcaster, and a consultant. She has worked in education for many years, and there is a whole generation of rangatahi who have learnt from her and with her. A beautiful speaker of te reo Māori, she also helped to create a body of Māori language resources for use by this generation and future generations.”</p>
<p>“She was passionate about politics, and ran for parliament in Tāmaki Makaurau. She would have made a formidable MP, in fact I would have quite enjoyed seeing her in action – it would have been an amazing sight.”</p>
<p>“She lived in Auckland for many years, and during her time there chaired Te Taura Here o Ngāti Porou ki Tāmaki Makaurau. She epitomised a staunch Ngāti Porou woman, always proud of her iwi, and always pleased to share that passion with anyone and everyone.”</p>

<p>“During her time in Auckland, she was kōkā, and Nanny to everyone. Always welcoming, always opening her arms and finding people to awhi. She was a beautiful singer, and her knowledge of history was always amazing. She was a connection home for many, and a valuable source of mātauranga Māori,” said Dr. Sharples.</p>
<p>“She truly has had an amazing life. Her children and her mokopuna are a testament to her wonderful character. She will be sorely missed,” said Te Ururoa Flavell.</p>
<p>“We mourn her loss, and extend our heartfelt aroha to her whanau and the communities within which she walked.”</p>
