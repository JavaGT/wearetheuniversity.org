<p>Give Us A Break – 1000&#39;s join nationwide tea break event</p>
<p>Thousands of workers in hundreds of workplaces around the country are taking part in a nationwide tea break this morning to celebrate the tea break, before the Government changes Employment Law to take away the automatic right to a rest or meal break, says CTU Secretary Peter Conway.</p>
<p>Peter Conway said “we have over 900 workplaces registered for this event around the country, in workplaces like milk factories, schools, supermarkets, hospitals, factories, and universities. Workers are getting together with their workmates for a morning tea/smoko/tea break at their workplaces. They will be talking about why the tea break is so important and sharing their thoughts through our <a href="http://fairnessatwork.tumblr.com/">Fairness at Work Tumblr site.</a> “</p>
<p>“Workers are outraged at the prospect of losing their tea break.”</p>
<p>“Workers understand this law is designed to reduce their pay and attacks even the most basic work rights, like the tea break which is essential for rest, a chance to talk to workmates and important for health and safety. They are very worried about how this law will impact them and their families.”</p>
<p>“This event is part of a broad campaign against these changes. Workers are standing up for fair employment laws that encourage collective bargaining as the way to higher wages in productive and safe workplaces, not changes that undermine bargaining and make it even harder for workers to get ahead,” said Peter Conway.</p>

<p>Information about rest and meal breaks</p>
<p>Under the current law your employer is obliged to give you (at the minimum) a paid 10-minute break for every four hours you work in a stretch plus a 30-minute meal break if you work more than four hours. You can agree when you take these breaks but if you don’t they will be spread evenly throughout the working day.</p>
<p>The proposed changes mean that where your employer believes they can’t reasonably provide breaks (or if you agree) then they can make you work without any meal or rest breaks at all. Where this occurs they’re required to compensate you for this (for example with an extra allowance or by letting you go home early).</p>
