<p><strong>Locals protest mineral prospecting in Schedule 4</strong></p>
<p>Coromandel locals are today protesting the prospecting of minerals by Sea Group Holdings Limited in a Schedule 4 area – an area the National Government has promised to protect from mining, the Green Party said.</p>
<p>Green Party mining spokesperson Catherine Delahunty along with Coromandel Watchdog and concerned locals are peacefully protesting the prospecting activities of Sea Group Holdings Limited who are prospecting for minerals in McGreor Bay of the Coromandel, which is under Schedule 4 protection. Schedule 4 areas are not allowed to be mined. This morning around 100 residents blocked the company from taking mineral samples in the harbour at low tide.<br>“This peaceful action today is to highlight that New Zealanders love and want to protect our national parks and wild places; they don’t want to see them dug up,” said Ms Delahunty.</p>
<p>“Conservation Minister Nick Smith claims that companies are prospecting in Schedule 4 in order to gain information that will help them mine areas outside of Schedule 4, but that is blatantly not the case,” said Ms Delahunty.</p>
<p>“Sea Group Holdings Limited has made it clear that it intends, after prospecting, to mine the inner waters of the Coromandel currently protected under Schedule 4.”</p>
<p>Company director Marcus Jacobson said, &quot;The first step is just working out what&#39;s there and then it&#39;s about identifying the best method and approach. It could be dredging but it wouldn&#39;t be the whole harbour, it would only be a defined area and, again, we&#39;d have to go through the resource consent process.”</p>

<p>“Companies clearly think this Government will allow them to mine in Schedule 4, but we are here today to remind them and the National Government that mining in Schedule 4 is against the law, and we will fight to protect these precious places,” said Ms Delahunty.</p>
<p>“The Government’s decision to allow minerals exploration on Schedule 4 conservation land betrays New Zealanders’ expectations of what they marched to protect in 2010.”</p>
<p>In 2010, tens-of-thousands of New Zealanders marched down Queens Street in Auckland to oppose the National Government’s plans to remove 7000 ha from Schedule 4.</p>
<p>“The National Government appears to be prepared to re-write history and break their promises about protected land and mining. Why else would they let companies prospect for minerals on land off-limits to mining?” said Ms Delahunty.</p>
<p>“To reassure New Zealanders that our National Parks and most precious conservation land won’t ever be open for mining, the Government should stop allowing minerals prospecting and exploration there.”</p>
<p>Since the Government’s promise in 2010 to keep mining out of Schedule 4 areas, the Government has granted ten mineral prospecting and exploration permits in Schedule 4 areas, including two in the inner waters of the Coromandel.</p>
