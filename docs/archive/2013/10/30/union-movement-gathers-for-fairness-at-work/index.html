<p><strong>Union movement gathers for ‘Fairness at Work’</strong></p>
<p><em>Adapted from an article for Kai Tiaki Nursing NZ. By Grant Brookes, delegate for the New Zealand Nurses Organisation (NZNO) and Fightback member.<br>October 29, 2013</em><br><a href="http://fightback.org.nz/2013/10/29/union-movement-gathers-for-fairness-at-work/">http://fightback.org.nz/2013/10/29/union-movement-gathers-for-fairness-at-work/</a></p>
<p>132 delegates, representing nearly 300,000 union members, met in Wellington on 9-10 October.</p>
<p>The Council of Trade Unions Biennial Conference 2013 examined the issues facing working people in New Zealand since the last gathering in 2011, and debated how to promote “Fairness at Work” as we face a fork in the road over the next two years.</p>
<p>Down one possible path, our future will see the end of guaranteed meal breaks, a loss of bargaining power, rising inequality and growing insecurity at work.</p>
<p>But the good news, conveyed in a speech to the Conference by Green Party co-leader Metiria Turei, is that we are heading towards election year with the momentum to create a different future.</p>
<p>Former NZNO organiser Jeff Sissons, now working as the CTU General Counsel, began by giving an overview of where we’re at now.</p>
<p>The proportion of workers belonging to a union fell from 50% to just over 20% during the 1990s, he said, as the National Government removed the legal right to belong to a union, in breach of our international human rights obligations.</p>
<p>The Employment Relations Act, passed by the Labour-led government in 2000, enabled unions to halt the decline. But it wasn’t enough to generate any real recovery, and workers in many jobs (especially in the private sector) are still without union protection.</p>

<p>As a result, New Zealand had the fastest growing gap between rich and poor of any developed country over the last 20 years.</p>
<p>Jeff Sissons discussed international research by two British epidemiologists, Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, showing that this inequality is behind many of today’s public health problems, from obesity, to mental illness and child mortality from accidents. And New Zealand’s income gap is still growing.</p>
<p>The Conference also launched a major new CTU report on the silent epidemic of insecure work (<a href="http://union.org.nz/underpressure">http://union.org.nz/underpressure</a>). Under Pressure: Insecure Work in New Zealand shows that at least 30% of New Zealand’s workers – over 635,000 people – are now in jobs without guaranteed hours, ongoing certainty of employment, or employment rights like sick leave, holidays, safety at work and freedom from discrimination. These workers often lack sufficient income and are powerless to change their situation.</p>
<p>CTU President Helen Kelly said the problem of insecure work could affect up to 50% of New Zealand’s workers. It has spread far beyond groups like young people working in fast food and is now creeping into the “good jobs” in health, banking, higher education and in government departments.</p>
<p>Helen Kelly mentioned the 120 staff employed in Elderslea Rest Home in Upper Hutt, who were told in July that management wanted to remove permanent rosters and roster them all casually, according to occupancy.</p>
<p>National’s latest changes to the Employment Relations Act will accelerate these trends and bring the problem of insecure work to more and more workplaces.</p>
<p>But in a keynote address, newly-elected Labour Party leader David Cunliffe spelled out his commitments for working people (<a href="https://www.labour.org.nz/media/speech-ctu-conference">https://www.labour.org.nz/media/speech-ctu-conference</a>).</p>
<p>“Labour will immediately raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. We will support the campaign for a Living Wage for all New Zealanders. A Labour Government I lead will scrap National’s unfair employment law changes – in the first hundred days.</p>
<p>“There will be no more fire at will without even an explanation. There will be no more attacks on collective bargaining, giving employers the right to opt out of good faith process. There will be no more attacks on vulnerable workers. There will be no more taking away smokos and lunch breaks.</p>
<p>“We will restore the protections for our most vulnerable workers currently contained in Part 6A of the Employment Relations Act.</p>
<p>“We will scrap youth rates because they violate the principle of equal pay for equal work. We will work to ensure pay equity. Labour will extend paid parental leave to a minimum of 26 weeks, as set out in Sue Moroney’s Member’s Bill.</p>
<p>“The Labour Government I lead will turn back the tide of anti-worker legislation that has been flowing from the Key Government for the last five years.”</p>
<p>Both Cunliffe and Metiria Turei signaled support for an overhaul of employment laws, tying into CTU efforts to move beyond the Employment Relations Act and further strengthen unions, collective bargaining and security at work.</p>
<p>“Labour will implement a new employment relations framework based on industry standard agreements”, said Cunliffe, “whereby working New Zealanders have a real choice to get together and negotiate better pay and conditions with their employers.”</p>
<p>But it also appeared that Cunliffe is straddling a contradiction. “These changes are not a one-off”, he said. “They need to be an enduring part of a New Zealand that finds common ground between productive workers and good employers.”</p>
<p>What happens when there is no “common ground”?</p>
<p>Cunliffe plugged his appointment of unionists Andrew Little, Darien Fenton and Carol Beaumont to industrial relations positions. But his speech to the Conference was silent about his appointment of neo-liberal hardliner David Parker to the finance portfolio.</p>
<p>“New Zealand needs a strategic shift in economic management”, he said, “from a cost-based strategy that treats workers as commodities whose cost is to be minimised, to one that sees workers as an integral part of a system that creates high value products and services”.</p>
<p>Does this verbal sleight-of-hand conceal two economic management strategies which are essentially the same?</p>
<p>The contradiction was also clear in Cunliffe’s response to a question from the Conference floor about the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He expressed support for PHARMAC, but also reiterated his party’s conditional support for the free trade deal threatening our state drug-buying agency.</p>
<p>How Cunliffe’s contradiction would play out in practice in a Labour-led government will depend on how unions respond.</p>
<p>Metiria Turei credited our movement with opening up the possibility of a different future, a path that is “good for people, good for the planet”.</p>
<p>“Workers and their unions are among those at the heart of the gathering momentum”, she said. “Thousands have joined rallies and stood up against National’s attacks”.</p>
<p>Helen Kelly called on us to “continue the local activism to get workers on the roll and out in the election campaign – not just to vote – connecting all the campaigns to make wages and work a key election issue” (<a href="http://union.org.nz/news/2013/speech-nzctu-president-helen-kelly-nzctu-biennial-conference-2013">http://union.org.nz/news/2013/speech-nzctu-president-helen-kelly-nzctu-biennial-conference-2013</a>).</p>
<p>The next step, she said, is the referendum on the sale of Meridian Energy, Mighty River Power, Genesis Power, Solid Energy and Air New Zealand, to be held between 22 November and 13 December.</p>
<p>NZNO supports the Save Our Assets campaign because warm homes, power prices and ultimately electricity privatisation are a health issue.</p>
<p>“We need to use events like the asset sale referendum to maximum advantage”, said Helen Kelly. “Delegates in workplaces can facilitate the voting in the asset sale referendum – get people who do not get a paper to get on the roll, and check that those with a paper cast their vote.</p>
<p>“We then need to keep the momentum going into next year. We can make the difference.”</p>
