<p><strong>Tuesday, 29 October 2013, 9:37 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Pulitzer Prize winner to teach at Victoria</p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington will launch a new programme in creative science writing by bringing Pulitzer Prize-winning American science writer Professor Deborah Blum to the capital to show how it’s done.</p>
<p>Professor Blum, who is the author of five books, including the New York Times bestseller The Poisoner’s Handbook, will teach a one-day workshop as part of an intensive four-week summer course in creative science writing, which is being offered for the first time at Victoria.</p>
<p>The course, a joint initiative by the International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML) and the Science Faculty at Victoria, is open to students in all disciplines and will explore a diverse range of non-fiction science writing possibilities, including essays, articles, memoirs, travel writing and biographies.</p>
<p>Science in Context senior lecturer Rebecca Priestley, who is also a leading science writer and Listener columnist, will be co-teaching the course with noted Wellington poet and essayist Ashleigh Young. Dr Priestley says having Professor Blum present to students gives them a unique opportunity.</p>
<p>“New Zealand doesn’t have a strong tradition of teaching science writing or science communication to undergraduates so we’re incredibly lucky to have Deborah Blum here to provide an international context and inspiration to our students.</p>
<p>“Our long-term goal is to make Victoria University a centre of excellence for teaching students how to communicate complex scientific ideas in an engaging way.”</p>

<p>While in Wellington, Professor Blum will also give a fully-subscribed masterclass to a small group of writers and scientists through Victoria University’s Centre for Lifelong Learning, and a public lecture at the Royal Society of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Professor Blum is a professor of science journalism at the University of Wisconsin and also writes a popular science blog, Elemental.</p>
<p>IIML director Damien Wilkins says, “We&#39;re excited to be partners in a course that aims to help bring the full range of creative expression to bear on the endlessly fascinating knowledge and debate that science generates.”</p>
<p>Applications for the creative science writing course, CREW 352, close on 1 November. To find out more, visit <a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz/modernletters">www.victoria.ac.nz/modernletters</a></p>
