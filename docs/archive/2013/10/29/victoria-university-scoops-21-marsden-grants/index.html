<p><strong>Victoria University scoops 21 Marsden grants</strong></p>
<p>Victoria University researchers have scooped 21 prestigious Marsden grants, the largest number ever received by the University.</p>
<p>The Marsden Fund supports research excellence, allowing New Zealand’s best researchers to explore ideas at the forefront of their disciplines.</p>
<p>Victoria researchers received 21 out of 109 grants funded nationwide, worth $11.2 million. The funding consists of 13 standard grants and eight Fast Start grants for emerging researchers.</p>
<p>Of the 21 successful Victoria researchers, 16 are in the Faculty of Science and five of those are in the School of Biological Sciences.</p>
<p>Professor Charles Daugherty, Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Research), says the results are confirmation of the strength of research capability at Victoria.</p>
<p>“The successful projects demonstrate the diversity and breadth of research being carried out at Victoria, as evidenced by Victoria’s Performance Based Research Fund (PBRF) ranking, in April of this year, as first among New Zealand universities based on the research performance of its academic staff.</p>
<p>“Particular highlights are the enhancement of Victoria’s growing reputation as a leader in the sciences and further evidence of the calibre of our Law School. This is the second year in a row that a Marsden grant has been awarded to one of Victoria’s law staff which is an outstanding achievement.</p>
<p>“We are also particularly pleased with receiving both Standard grants, to support outstanding senior researchers, and eight Fast Start grants as they support New Zealand’s researchers of the future.”</p>
<p>Projects to win funding range from research into invasive wasps, seismic risk, climate change and human fertility to the personal impact of religion and spirituality, young people’s mental health and New Zealand’s Bill of Rights Act.</p>
