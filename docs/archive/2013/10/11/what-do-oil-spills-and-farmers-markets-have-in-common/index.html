<p>11 October 2013</p>
<p><strong>What do oil spills and farmers’ markets have in common?</strong></p>
<p>This year’s University of Waikato Three Minute Thesis (3MT) final will be a multi-national event with PhD students from the USA, Russia and New Zealand taking part.</p>
<p>The 10 doctoral finalists will have three minutes to talk about their research and present it to a lay-audience with the winner taking home $3000 and going on to represent Waikato at the Trans-Tasman 3MT competition next year.</p>
<p>Fulbright scholar Sarah Lockwood from Tauranga is presenting on her research into the Rena oil spill crisis. Her research aims to better understand the unique organising and communicating dynamics of Generation Y volunteers.</p>
<p>Travis Bartosh from the US has been working on analysing language themes from farmers’ markets to understand how the markets engage with the processes of globalisation.</p>
<p>Steven Farnworth from Te Awamutu will present on whether or not New Zealand is prepared for the legal fallout from a Deepwater Horizon-sized oil well blowout. His thesis explores international liability and compensation models to find the answers.</p>
<p>The 3MT final will be hosted by comedienne Michele A’Court and starts at 7pm at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts on October 22. The event is free and all are welcome to attend.</p>
