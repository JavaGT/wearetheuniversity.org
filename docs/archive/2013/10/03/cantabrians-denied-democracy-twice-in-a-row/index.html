<p>Cantabrians denied democracy twice in a row</p>
<p>Cantabrians have again been shut out of local democracy by the National Government, which has banned them from electing their Environment Canterbury representatives for the second election in a row, says Labour’s Local Government spokesperson, Su’a William Sio.</p>
<p>“National continues its push to usurp local government rights and reduce community input despite outrage by Cantabrians over their treatment.</p>
<p>“Despite Nick Smith promising that ‘whatever the circumstances the next regional council elections in Canterbury will take place no later than the elections scheduled for late 2013’, the Government has delayed elections for Environment Canterbury (ECan) until 2016.</p>
<p>“Not only are Cantabrians being denied a vote for their ECan representatives for another three years, but the Government’s move continues to prevent appeals by the general public to the Environment Court on resource management.</p>
<p>“Even strong opposition from the Human Rights Commission, who submitted that the policy means the Government would be in breach of its international obligations, seems to have fallen on deaf ears.</p>
<p>“This government has given itself and its ministers the powers to ride roughshod over the environmental priorities of local and regional communities and is simply wrong from a human rights perspective”, said Su’a William Sio.</p>
