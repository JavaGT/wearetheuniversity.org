<p>Health Spokesperson<br>3 October 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Ryall’s fairy dust at work again</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of the most vulnerable Kiwis, already struggling to access health care services, look set to be further disadvantaged despite claims to the contrary from Tony Ryall, says Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/more-funding-low-cost-gp-practices">Mr Ryall claims</a> that funding for the very low cost access (VLCA) scheme has increased 85 per cent in the past six years, with a top-up of $4 million this year.</p>
<p>“As usual he’s gilding the lily with a very large dollop of fairy dust.</p>
<p>“Ministry of Health Estimates (below) show that since National became Government funding has gone from $39.1 million in 2009/10 to $42.7 million in 2013, a 9.1 per cent increase.</p>
<p>“The $4 million equates to a $5.60 subsidy per person per year, and is $146 million less than the cash injection pumped into Solid Energy this week.</p>
<p>“Not only that, there are also thousands of high-needs patients unable to access cheap healthcare because the practices they are enrolled with don’t meet VCLA criteria, and clinics facing closure because of cost pressures.</p>
<p>“Mr Ryall needs to listen to the advice of Chief Science Advisor Peter Gluckman and base his policies on actual evidence.</p>
<p>“The evidence in this instance is staring him in the face.</p>
<p>“There are more than a million Kiwis classified as high-needs. These are the people who are turning up at emergency departments and not picking up prescriptions because they can’t afford to see a GP or pay for their medication.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately for them this Government has yet to come to grips with that fact that a comprehensive health package should not only reduce inequalities in accessing healthcare, but also tackle the root causes of that equality.</p>
<p>“It’s time to rethink how and what we fund ( see attached speech) and provide for those with the highest health inequalities.”</p>
