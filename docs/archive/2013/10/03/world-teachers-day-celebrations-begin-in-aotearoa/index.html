<p>3 October 2013</p>
<p>Immediate Release</p>
<p>World Teachers’ Day celebrations begin in Aotearoa/New Zealand</p>
<p>The global celebrations for World Teachers’ Day (5 October) will begin at dawn with a ceremony and powhiri in Gisborne – the first place in the world to see the sun.</p>
<p>Principals, teachers and support staff, parents and kids will gather on the beach to mark the start of the day and a year of events to celebrate quality teaching and learning.</p>
<p>Gisborne’s Mayor, Meng Foon will speak at the celebration along with local kaumatua and educators.</p>
<p>NZEI National President Judith Nowotarski says it’s important that October the 5th is a celebration of quality teaching and learning.</p>
<p>As part of the celebrations, a “tokotoko” or talking stick to symbolise the passing on of stories, knowledge and learning left Aotearoa for New York earlier in the week for the launch of a Year of Action for education.</p>
<p>The tototoko was presented to Education International President Susan Hopgood at the NZEI Te Riu Roa Annual Conference in Rotorua.</p>
<p>With its design representing the four winds – peoples from the four corners of the earth – the tokotoko reinforces the message that sharing the values and successes of quality public education is critically important.</p>
<p>International celebrations will be marked by Education International (EI – the global union federation that represents education professionals worldwide) and other education unions around the world launching the Year of Action in New York and Paris.</p>
<p>Celebrations will also be visible online where students and parents will have an opportunity to go online and thank a teacher.</p>
<p>World Teachers’ Day, held annually on 5 October since 1994, aims to mobilise support for teachers and to ensure that the needs of future generations will continue to be met by teachers.<br>ends</p>
