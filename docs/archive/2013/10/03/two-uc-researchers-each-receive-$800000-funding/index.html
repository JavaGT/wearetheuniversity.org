<p><strong>Two UC researchers each receive $800,000 funding for research</strong></p>
<p><strong>October 3, 2013</strong></p>
<p>Two University of Canterbury (UC) researchers have each received $800,000 of Rutherford Discovery Fellowship funding over five years to further their research.</p>
<p>Biological sciences researcher Dr Daniel Stouffer will look at a theory of evolution in ecological networks while civil and natural resources engineer Dr Brendon Bradley will investigate the mysteries of unresolved ground motion and geotechnical case-histories from the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes.</p>
<p>Dr Bradley will analyse data from the earthquakes and will apply world-leading research expertise to understand severe ground motions in the Christchurch urban area and extensive liquefaction and damage to structures and infrastructure. </p>
<p>His research will have a national and international impact in the assessment and mitigation of earthquake hazards in major cities.</p>
<p>Dr Bradley has covered a wide range of earthquake engineering issues relating to ground shaking, analysis of structures and geotechnical systems, and methods for assessing seismic performance. </p>
<p>He has been heavily involved in numerous aspects of the earthquakes, as well as monitoring the impacts of the 2011 Tohoku, Japan, earthquake and the 2009 Samoan tsunami.</p>
<p>Dr Stouffer aims to use the five year funding to develop a general understanding of evolution in ecological networks. In particular, he will investigate the ecological and evolutionary implications of species&#39; interactions for the persistence and viability of species populations.</p>

<p>His research will help to develop strategies to preserve the diverse and complex ecological communities that form a key part of New Zealand&#39;s national identity and biological heritage.</p>
<p>UC’s School of Biological Sciences has now won four Rutherford Discovery Fellowships which is the highest concentration in any tertiary department in the country. Dr Anthony Poole, Dr Paul Gardener and Professor Jason Tylianakis are other UC biological science researchers to receive Rutherford grants.</p>
<p>The fellowships are designed to develop and foster future leaders in the New Zealand science sector. They are funded by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand.</p>
