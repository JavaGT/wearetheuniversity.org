<p>8 October 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Bizarre report won’t help struggling regions</strong><br>National has finally realised it is being hit in the regions and has released a bizarre report in a desperate attempt to cover up the damage it has caused, says Labour Leader David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“The regions are struggling under National. They have been ignored for five long years. Labour is speaking up for the regions and putting our time and efforts into the provinces.</p>
<p>“National is running scared, it knows it is losing support. The Government’s report simply catalogues historical spending across all services, including welfare, education and health.</p>
<p>“This data is more than a year old and has nothing to do with regional development and investment.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t show the real problems facing the regions.</p>
<p>“Since 2008 incomes in Tasman, Nelson, Marlborough and West Coast have fallen by 3.3 per cent and in Gisborne and Hawkes Bay by 2.6 per cent[1].</p>
<p>“In the last year house prices in Wanganui have fallen by 4.6 per cent and in Southland have fallen by 6.6 per cent.</p>
<p>“Over 4600 people have the left Waikato for Australia in the past year, along with 1800 from Northland.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce and Bill English clearly don’t get it. They have lost touch with the regions.</p>
<p>“Today I have been with my entire caucus in Dunedin to hear the concerns of local people and businesses. It is clear people in the regions are furious with this Government.</p>
<p>“Labour is listening to small town New Zealand,” David Cunliffe says.</p>
