<h5>Stephen Clark graduates today with a Bachelor of Arts majoring in te reo Māori.</h5>
<p>Today ( October 8) Stephen Clark graduates with a Bachelor of Arts that he began 30 years ago.</p>
<p>What started as a BA majoring in English in 1983, has now become a BA, majoring in te reo Māori.</p>
<p>Stephen, who is a Māori Land Court Judge, an alternate Judge of the Environment Court and a member of the Waitangi Tribunal, says there were many factors that delayed completion of his BA.</p>
<p>“First I moved to Auckland to study law in 1985, which took three years, followed by study for the Professionals course. Then I started working as a lawyer in 1988 initially in Auckland and then for 18 years in Hamilton. The demands of a busy legal career and a young family have meant study had to fit in around other aspects of my life, but I’m very happy to be finishing this degree now.”</p>
<p>Based in Hamilton, Stephen is a former Melville High School student. He graduated with an LLB from the University of Auckland in 1988 and was admitted to the Bar in the same year. Stephen also received a Graduate Diploma in Dispute Resolution from the University of Waikato in 2007.</p>
<p>Of Ngāti Maniapoto and Ngāti Hāua descent, Stephen says there were three main reasons that drove him to complete the BA.</p>
<p>“It was important to me to finish what I started. Also, speaking te reo Māori is encouraged in my line of work. Most importantly I really wanted to support my son and daughter who both attended kōhanga reo, and currently attend Tōku Māpihi Maurea Kura Kaupapa Māori.</p>

<p>During the time he has been studying at Waikato, Stephen has seen big changes both in the physical environment at university and the way in which students study.</p>
<p>“When I first started studying, the resources we used were books, pens and paper, whereas now everyone has a laptop or iPad, all assignments are typed, lecture notes are available on Moodle, the internet is regularly cited and presentations are made with the assistance of PowerPoint.</p>
<p>Stephen will graduate on Tuesday, 8 October at Te Kohinga Mārama Marae at the University of Waikato.</p>
