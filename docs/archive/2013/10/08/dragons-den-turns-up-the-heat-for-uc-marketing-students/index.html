<p><strong>Dragons’ Den turns up the heat for UC marketing students</strong></p>
<p><strong>October 8, 2013</strong></p>
<p>More than 175 University of Canterbury (UC) marketing students in 35 groups are feeling the heat this week in a Dragon’s Den style business competition.</p>
<p>They will be pitting their proposals to judges who will narrow down the numbers until a winning team is found.</p>
<p>Students have been given the task to develop a new product that could be marketed in a New Zealand supermarket and launched under the wing of an existing corporation in the fast moving consumer goods category.  They are allocated an imaginary budget of $1.5 million to achieve a launch on a national basis, UC marketing lecturer Associate Professor Dave Fortin says. </p>
<p>``Students involved this year are working toward their Bachelor of Commerce degree and this task is part of their requirement for a marketing management course.  There are three Dragons (or judges) that will hear all the presentations and provide comments over a three-day period. </p>
<p>``There will be a winner for each of the four categories of: beverages, snacks, breakfast food and dairy/frozen goods.  A Grand Prize Gold Dragon winning team will be announced on Wednesday (October 9).</p>
<p>``Last year, the grand prize winners were invited to present their proposal to well-known chocolate maker Whittaker’s in Wellington. The students involved were Sandy Austin-Fraser, Lucy Shearer, Jonathan Nabbs and Tim Phillipson. </p>
<p>``It was a pivotal learning experience for the students and a real world opportunity to connect with the New Zealand business community.’’</p>
<p>This is just one of many activities that students enrolled in a Bachelor of Commerce degree are involved in and is based on a UC philosophy of active learning promoted by Professor Fortin, based on his experience in the advertising agency business. </p>
<p>UC is ranked as the No.1 school in New Zealand for studying marketing and tourism based on the 2013 PBRF rankings.</p>
