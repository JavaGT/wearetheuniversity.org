<p><strong>Graduate wins top global design prize</strong></p>
<p>Global design organisation Red Dot has presented Massey University industrial design graduate Stacey Kenny with its top prize, the Luminary Award, for her design of an urban hen house to rehome spent laying hens.</p>
<p>Ms Kenny, 22 from Auckland, who was only one of three nominees worldwide eligible for the award, was presented with her prize that includes $5000, at a glittering awards ceremony in Singapore on Friday night.</p>
<p>The awards are recognised by designers as an international seal of quality for the prize winner and their centre of learning - in this case the School of Design at Massey’s College of Creative Arts on the Wellington campus.</p>
<p>Along with Ms Kenny, three other Massey graduates were placed in the industrial design categories, putting them in the top 6 per cent of nearly 4400 entries from 56 countries. A further five Massey graduates were placed in the communication design categories (judged in Berlin), which received 6800 entries from 43 countries.</p>
<p>Ms Kenny’s Nest Urban Hen House entry was the final project for her design degree at Massey.</p>
<p>The design allows spent hens to recover their productivity and lay eggs for many years after being retired from commercial farms. A rotating cage gives the hens access to fresh grass, while the light in the roosting perch can be adjusted to help the birds, which are typically light-sensitive after a life as a caged battery hen.</p>
<p>Ms Kenny, who returns home on Monday, estimates that the average life of a battery hen could be doubled to eight years through the use of her design.</p>
<p>Since completing the design last November, the Auckland-based designer has been employed as an industrial engineer at door manufacturer CS For Doors.</p>
