<p><strong>CTU Welcomes Canterbury Health and Safety Funding</strong></p>
<p>The CTU is welcoming the Government&#39;s commitment to fund a dedicated health and safety programme targeting the Canterbury rebuild.</p>
<p>$10.7 million over the next four years is being allocated to the Canterbury programme as part of Government&#39;s Working Safer package.</p>
<p>&quot;The building of Government and industry capacity in the Canterbury region to make construction safer is essential,&quot; says Paul Watson, CTU Canterbury Rebuild Recovery Coordinator.</p>
<p>&quot;However, real success in meeting safety objectives will involve a partnership approach with all parties, including workers and their unions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Working Safer&#39;s strengthening of worker participation and systems at the workplace is a positive step. The CTU and unions in Canterbury have a major role to play in actively supporting and educating workers and their representatives so they can play a genuine role in keeping workplaces safe,&quot; says Paul Watson. &quot;We look forward to a legitimate tripartite approach to construction safety and the leadership role the union movement plays in the safe rebuild of Christchurch.&quot;</p>
<p>Paul Watson said that unions are a partner with employers and the Government in the Safe Rebuild project in Canterbury which is supported by Government funding.</p>
