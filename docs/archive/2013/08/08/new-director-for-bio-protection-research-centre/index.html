<p>Media Release<br>8 August 2013<br><em>- for immediate release</em></p>
<p><strong>New Director for Bio-Protection Research Centre</strong></p>
<p>The South Island’s only national Centre for Research Excellence – located at Lincoln University – has today announced the appointment of Professor Travis Glare to the position of Director. </p>
<p>Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor, Dr Andrew West, made the announcement, saying that Professor Glare will bring a strong blend of fundamental and applied research experience to his leadership of the Centre.  &quot;His previous experience in university and CRI roles provides an excellent foundation for fostering collaboration across the many research institutes making up this national Centre of Research Excellence.  Working at the forefront of new technologies for bio-protection of New Zealand&#39;s economically important primary industries, Professor Glare has a critical appreciation of the valuable role the Bio-Protection Research Centre can play.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bio-Protection Research Centre is one of seven designated Centres of Research Excellence funded by the Tertiary Education Commission.  It is hosted by Lincoln University and integrates across the strengths of its four partner institutes – Lincoln University, Massey University, AgResearch and Plant &amp; Food Research.  It also includes collaborations with several other national and international research institutes.  The Centre&#39;s primary goal is to strengthen the value of New Zealand&#39;s pastoral, horticultural and forestry industries through research to generate next generation bio-protection (biosecurity and bio-control) solutions.</p>

<p>Professor Glare is an applied entomologist specialising in the development of biological controls for insect pests and has been involved with the Bio-Protection Research Centre since its inception in 2003.  Prior to taking up a professorial role at Lincoln University in 2009, Professor Glare held senior management positions in AgResearch.  His research leadership is illustrated through authorship of more than 100 refereed research publications and book chapters.  He also holds nine patents related to biological control of insect pests.</p>
<p>Chair of the Board for the Research Centre, Dr John Hay, says &quot;Professor Glare has a strong international reputation for blending fundamental research with practical outcomes.  He appreciates and is ready to address strategic challenges facing the Bio-Protection Research Centre, as it responds to Government expectations for Centres of Research Excellence and the National Science Challenges, while also ensuring its research paves the way for the next generation of bio-protection solutions needed by New Zealand&#39;s primary industries.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Glare was awarded a PhD from the Australian National University in 1988.  His subsequent research has included a strong focus on entomopathogenic fungi and bacteria, and their potential application as biological control agents for plant pests, including grass grub, clover root weevil and white-spotted tussock moth.  He is currently an Editorial Board member for the Biocontrol Science and Technology journal and the Journal of Biopesticides and has served regularly on assessment panels for Government research funds. </p>
<p>Professor Glare will take up his position, based at Lincoln University, on 19 August 2013.</p>
