<p>Will sparks fly at the Destiny Book launch?</p>
<p>Massey University Associate Professor Peter Lineham will launch his book on the Destiny Church on Thursday, and he’s invited Bishop Brian Tamaki and Pastor Richard Lewis to speak.</p>
<p>“They’ve certainly said they’re coming to the launch. Brian will denounce the book or may try to convert the audience – he may not even show,” says Dr Lineham.</p>
<p>Destiny: the life and times of a self-made apostle is the first truly objective and independent account of the church, its people and the infamous man behind it – Bishop Brian Tamaki. It offers a scholarly and imminently readable theological study of a charismatic Christian movement.</p>
<p>“I dropped a copy out to them as soon as one was available because I wanted to be respectful,” he says. “Hannah Tamaki sent me a text saying it should have been proof-read first, and she was happy to have a photo taken with her and the book. She’s wearing her $90,000 ring. Here’s clear proof that I did get insider access.”</p>
<p>The book contains a media analysis, including the hostility of the mainstream media and its use by the Destiny Church. Dr Lineham wanted to move beyond the anti-church attacks to delve deeper into the movement.</p>
<p>“Part of my point is that this is a really interesting movement to just understand – you don’t have to attack them. That’s the real motivation of the book,” he says. “As a result, we’ll understand something that’s going on in New Zealand when all everybody ever talks about is religious decline. Well, here you’ve got – it’s not exactly religious decline – it may not be booming as it once was, but it’s a force to be reckoned with.”</p>

<p>Although his research points to a move away from the church by its rich white congregation, Dr Lineham says money is still flowing for its new multi-million dollar “City of God” in South Auckland.</p>
<p>“They take free gifts very willingly. I was out there on New Year’s Eve – they invited me to come to the first service in the new building in the City of God. It was quite a delightful event, but everyone had to bring their own seats because they weren’t well advanced with the building – they’re still not well advanced in the auditorium. But I discovered before I got there that everybody was expected to bring $1000. Clearly I wasn’t expected to bring $1000 because I wasn’t told when I was invited… I got a special blessing from the Bishop because he went around and prayed for everybody. There were about 2000 people there.”</p>
<p>Dr Lineham says writing the book took a bit of work, but he considers it worthwhile.</p>
<p>The launch will be held on the third floor of the Albany campus library starting at 4.50 pm.</p>
<p>Copies of the book will be available to purchase on the night for $38.00.<br>ends</p>
