<p><strong>Christchurch showcasing innovation, engagement and improved quality of life</strong><br> <br><strong>August 4, 2013</strong><br> <br>Christchurch is using its recovery phase as an opportunity to showcase innovation, community engagement and improved quality of life for residents and migrants, a University of Canterbury (UC) lecturer says.<br> <br>UC tourism researcher Dr Girish Prayag says any city that goes through a big event has the ability to recover and grow as vibrancy returns to the city.<br> <br>``The growth in nightlife will contribute to the city’s appeal. Nightlife when combined with other aspects of the tourism offer such as improved infrastructure, new tourism products and gastronomic experiences can have a positive impact.<br> <br>``The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment figures show that in the six months to June the number of international visitors has gone up on the same period last year, to 575,429 visitors, while the domestic market also improved last year.<br> <br>``The outlook for Christchurch is promising. Lonely Planet named Christchurch one of the top 10 cities in the world to visit this year. That will certainly attract visitors,’’ Dr Prayag says.<br> <br>Christchurch and Canterbury Tourism says Christchurch has seen a huge increase in vibrancy and creativity over the last two years.<br> <br>``Visitors to Christchurch will definitely appreciate more choice and convenience that has come from the increased nightlife within the city,’’ says Rowan Townsend, General Manager Marketing at Christchurch and Canterbury Tourism.<br> <br>``The next few months look incredibly positive for Christchurch. We have around 600 hotel beds coming back on board, the Tram reopening, the Arts Centre markets, the Transitional Cathedral along with many restaurants, bars and key events like the New Zealand Cup and Show Week.’’<br> <br>Christchurch Airport chief executive Jim Boult says there is a noticeable air of optimism across Christchurch business circles, with genuine anticipation of significant progress being made this year and into the near future.<br> <br>``Rebuilding the city means renewing it for the future, an opportunity few cities in the world ever have. It is expected to cost about $40 billion, which will inject an enormous amount into the local economy. The city can be built back better than it was before, increasing its value to the region and New Zealand as a whole.<br> <br>``There is a lot of investment and support for the city, as well as opportunity for many people to take an active part in shaping the city’s future. Christchurch is destined to be the most exciting city in Australasia for the next decade.’’<br> <br>Canterbury Employers’ Chamber of Commerce chief executive Peter Townsend says the hospitality sector has shown the same remarkable resilience as the rest of the business community.<br> <br>``We are seeing a rapid rise in offerings around the city. Pockets of increasing activity such as in Lincoln Road are attracting good support. Getting a range of good offerings back into the central city will take time but already people like Anthony Gough are showing the way.<br> <br>``Getting the hospitality offering right will be a challenge given the different rates of recovery for different areas in wider Christchurch, but I have no doubt the sector will continue to rise to that challenge.’’<br>Latest figures released by UC researcher Dr Sussie Morrish show 794 restaurants and bars are now open in Christchurch, compared with just 566 in January last year.<br> <br>The region continues to see significant increases in student employment opportunities in Canterbury. Student Job Services says it had 5650 job vacancies in the first seven months of this year, compared to 3579 for the same period in 2011.</p>
