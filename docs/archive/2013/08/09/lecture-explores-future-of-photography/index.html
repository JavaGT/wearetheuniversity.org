<p><strong>Lecture explores future of photography</strong></p>
<p>Massey University’s annual Peter Turner Memorial Lecture and Symposium this year looks to the past for hints as to the future of photography.</p>
<p>Professor Geoffrey Batchen, an internationally renowned photographic historian, teacher, writer and curator based in Wellington will deliver the 2013 lecture on Friday August 16. His talk will consider the future of photography while tracing a history of photography’s dissemination, from the daguerreotype era to today.</p>
<p>Distinguished Professor Anne Noble describes Professor Batchen, who teaches the history of photography at Victoria University, as “one of New Zealand’s hidden gems…yet in Wellington he goes virtually unremarked outside the field of photography. Given our strength in photography at Massey Wellington, we felt it was incumbent on us to celebrate this modest expert on our doorstep.”</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2008 the annual lecture has become a must-attend event on the calendar for photographers, gallery curators, educators and photography enthusiasts. The lecture was established in memory of the late Peter Turner – photographic historian, curator, author, editor, publisher and teacher.</p>
<p>The following day, the photography programme Professor Noble leads at the College of Creative Arts hosts an associated one-day symposium featuring New Zealand and international photographers, artists, writers curators and researchers.</p>
<p>This year the symposium will generate discussion and share perspectives on the expansion of contemporary photographic practices, technologies and contexts; impacts of change on the creation, dissemination and archiving of contemporary photography and how the writing and study of the histories of photography informs understanding of where photography will fit in the future cultural landscape.</p>
<p>“The ubiquity of photography today poses real challenges for many of us who work as professional photographers, artists, writers and curators,” Professor Noble says.</p>
<p>“As one of our symposium speakers, US photographer Doug Rickard points out, photography has become a ‘universal language’. Doug’s work for example, uses Google StreetView. The symposium is an opportunity for the New Zealand photographic community to hear how a range a engaging speakers are continuing to explore the possibilities of photography.”</p>
