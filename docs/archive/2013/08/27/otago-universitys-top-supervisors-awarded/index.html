<p>Otago University’s Top Supervisors Awarded</p>
<p>The Otago University Students’ Association and the University of Otago are proud to announce the winners of the OUSA 2013 Supervisor of the Year Awards.</p>
<p>“The awards recognise the supervisors that go above and beyond for their students during their post graduate study.” Said Francisco Hernandez, OUSA President, “Supervisors are key to the process of researching, guiding, proofing and submitting a student’s thesis.</p>
<p>The supervisors are nominated and voted for by students, and each year OUSA receives hundreds of nominations for supervisors which is tribute to the University of Otago staff.</p>
<p>“These award recipients represent the supervisors who stand out and help students not only in their study but assist students in the directions their lives take after studying.” Said Mr. Hernandez, “I’m sure more often than not they also have their fair share of tears thrown their way as well as submission deadlines creep closer!”</p>
<p>The award recipients come from all divisions of the University as well as recognising the top over all Supervisor, the New Supervisor of the year and a very Special Posthumous Commemoration for Dr. Tamar Murachver from the University of Otago Psychology Department.</p>
<p>The award ceremony will be Monday 26th August 3pm to 4.30pm in the Main Common Room, Student Union Building.</p>

<p>Quotes from students about Dr. Roslyn Kemp:</p>
<p>“Awesome supervisor who always looks out and supports her students. Not afraid to push us to make sure we are making the most of our opportunities such as presenting at conferences. Also has a lot of trust in us in letting us direct our research.”</p>
<p>“She&#39;s so helpful and understanding with regards to project matters, has boosted my confidence as a person and a scientist, and shown me that no matter where I come from that my set of lenses are useful and can be applied to a research field. She has made me realise my full potential and continues to lay down challenges to overcome so that I can grow more.”</p>
<p>“Ros goes above and beyond what is expected of any supervisor. All questions are answered, her students are her priority, and the effort she puts in for us is unquestionable.”</p>
<p>Quotes from students about Associate Professor Jacinta Ruru:</p>
<p>“I would not have decided to do an LLM at Otago if it wasn&#39;t for her. In fact I would not be professionally where I am if it wasn&#39;t for her excellent supervision and mentoring over the years.”</p>
<p>“She in consistently caring, flexible, thoughtful, wise and generous in her advice, responds quickly, guides appropriately, and is simply excellent.”</p>
