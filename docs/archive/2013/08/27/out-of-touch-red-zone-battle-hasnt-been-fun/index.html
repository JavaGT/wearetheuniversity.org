<p>Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson<br>27 August 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Out of touch: Red Zone battle hasn’t ‘been fun’</strong></p>
<p>John Key’s claim that the drawn-out legal battle for Red Zone property owners has ‘been fun’ is offensive and he should apologise, says Labour’s Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson Ruth Dyson.</p>
<p>“John Key’s reaction to the court decision that requires Earthquake Minister Gerry Brownlee to reconsider his unfair half-RV offer to Red Zone property owners has offended a lot of Cantabrians.</p>
<p>“Today he said: ‘One option is the Government says ‘thanks very much. It’s been a lot of fun. If you don&#39;t want to take the offer, that&#39;s where it’s at’.’</p>
<p>“How on earth can he possibly call a drawn-out legal battle for people who are losing tens of thousands of dollars due to a massive earthquake ‘fun’?</p>
<p>“That is out of touch. That is arrogant.</p>
<p>“Instead of accepting the ruling the Government is looking to appeal. Presumably that’s because Mr Key is having so much fun. It won’t be fun for the Red Zone owners.</p>
<p>“The 50 per cent offer the Government made to owners of insured commercial premises and owners of bare sections in the residential Red Zone was found to flout the law and leave property owners out of pocket.</p>
<p>“John Key claims that he is helping these owners because they don’t have insurance. But it’s bare land or commercial land - it couldn’t be insured in the first place. If an owner had started building they would get a 100 per cent RV Government offer. The difference is unfair and the legal arguments about it are not fun at all.</p>
<p>“John Key needs to do two things immediately. First, apologise to the Red Zone land owners. Second, stop the appeal,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
