<p>Pace-bowler nabs cricket contract with Northern Knights</p>
<p>A strong season on the cricket pitch has seen University of Waikato student and right-arm pace-bowler Tony Goodin land a six-month contract with the Northern Knights starting on 1 October.</p>
<p>The former Mount Maunganui College student is now in his final semester of a Bachelor of Sport and Leisure Studies.</p>
<p>Tony says he was “pretty stoked” when he heard about his selection for the Northern Knights.</p>
<p>“It was a lot of hard work but it’s what I’ve always wanted to do. I hope it will lead to playing for New Zealand one day.”</p>
<p>His contract with the Northern Knights is a reflection of the great season Tony has had with Bay of Plenty Cricket, being named Bay of Plenty Cricketer of the Year in 2012-2013 after smashing the club’s all-time most wickets in a season record with 44 wickets in 12 appearances. His performance with Bay of Plenty helped the team retain the coveted Hawke Cup.</p>
<p>Tony started playing cricket “in the back yard with the old man” before going through Kiwi Cricket then on to play for the Mount Maunganui Cricket Club as a junior.</p>
<p>Tony says he is looking forward to his season with the Knights, especially as he and the team’s coach James Pamment go back a long way. Pamment coached him at the Mount Maunganui club when he was only seven years old.</p>
<p>And what he likes most about cricket? “Every game is different and you always have good guys around you.”</p>
