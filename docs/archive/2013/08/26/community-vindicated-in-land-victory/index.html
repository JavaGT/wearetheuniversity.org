<p>Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson<br>26 August 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Community vindicated in land victory</strong></p>
<p>Red-zone property owners have been vindicated this afternoon following a <a href="http://www.3news.co.nz/Court-overturns-redzone-buyout-offer/tabid/423/articleID/310657/Default.aspx">court decision</a> that requires Earthquake Minister Gerry Brownlee to reconsider his unfair half-RV offer, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Ruth Dyson.</p>
<p>The 50 per cent offer the Government made to owners of insured commercial premises and owners of bare sections in the residential red zone has been found to flout the law and leave property owners out of pocket.</p>
<p>“This is a victory for residents and for fairness,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>“Labour has said from the outset that the Government decision was unfair. John Key said no one would be worse off as a result of his Government’s offer, and today’s verdict proves that many, many people were.</p>
<p>“The Government’s policy and inflexible timelines saw families signing away their only assets. All those affected asked for was to be offered rateable value in the same way as every other red zone property was offered.</p>
<p>“There has always been a lot more at stake here than the cost of land alone. People invested in their land and for many it represented their single most valuable asset. All they wanted was a fair say and equal treatment.</p>
<p>“Today’s recognition that these residents are in the right is a win for the common-sense approach Cantabrians have taken with their grievances. It is a proud day for the community in Canterbury,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
