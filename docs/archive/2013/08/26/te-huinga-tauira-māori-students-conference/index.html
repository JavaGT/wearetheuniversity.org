<p>Te Huinga Tauira Māori Students’ Conference focusses on leadership</p>
<p>This year’s Te Huinga Tauira National Māori Students’ Conference is being hosted by Te Waiora o te Whare Wānanga o Waikato, a university group with a Māori focus, at the University of Waikato. It is the first time the group has hosted the four-day event, which starts on 29 August.</p>
<p>The conference will bring together 250-300 Māori students from universities around the country to take part in activities such as manu kōrero (speech competition), hākinakina (sports), kapa haka (performing arts), presentations and workshops.</p>
<p>Workshops include hoe waka, where students will participate in waka ama activities, taonga pūoro (the history of traditional Māori instruments and their uses), Tū Tauā (traditional Maori weaponry) and tātai whetū (presentation of Māori star constellations and pūrākau).</p>
<p>The conference also features renowned guest speakers: University of Waikato Professor of Tikanga Māori Pou Tēmara, Labour MP for Hauraki-Waikato Nanaia Mahuta, kapa haka advocate Te Rita Papesch, creator of Te Aho Tūroa and Te Rāranga Tira Māori youth programmes Te Rawhitiroa Bocsh, and Ninakaye Taane Tinorau, manager of Tiki Taane and TikiDub Productions.</p>
<p>Te Waiora o te Whare Wānanga o Waikato was established in 2010 and fosters Māori students to actively contribute towards all aspects of university life (academic, cultural, sporting and social). Te Waiora provides a whānau during their time at university.</p>

<p>This year, Te Huinga Tauira’s theme is leadership. The conference aims to provide an insight into the Māori world and how Māori perceive leadership, fostering and developing leaders among the attendees.</p>
<p>Te Waiora President Kristin Ross says that now the conference has been put together, “it’s time to get excited”.<br>“The highlight will be Māori students coming together for four days and celebrating being Māori,” she says.<br>“We have selected a panel of prominent figures within the Māori world to present their views on leadership, how it applies to Māori students, and how it can enhance their studies or careers.”</p>
<p>The public is welcome to attend the powhiri at the University’s Te Kohinga Mārama marae at 1pm on Thursday 29 August, and also kapa haka performances on Friday 30 August from 2.30pm at The Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts on the university campus.</p>
<p>Te Huinga Tauira is on at the University of Waikato from Thursday 29 August until Sunday 1 September 2013.</p>
