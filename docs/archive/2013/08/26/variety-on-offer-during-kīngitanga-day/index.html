<p><strong>Variety on offer during Kīngitanga Day</strong></p>
<p>Graphic design, guns and going across the ditch are among a wide ranging line up of subjects being discussed at this year’s Kīngitanga Day at the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>Kīngitanga Day, being held on 12 September, is a free public annual event that celebrates the University’s relationships with the Kīngitanga and with iwi from across the nation. It will see a number of prominent academics, leaders and kaumātua taking part in lectures, seminars and other activities on campus.</p>
<p>Artist, designer and researcher Johnson Witehira, of Ngāpuhi and Whanganui descent, is speaking about <em>Design Practises with a Focus on Māori Design Patterns.</em> His popular artworks have resulted in the creation of the first set of Māori alphabet blocks.</p>
<p>He’s also the winner of a Chorus digital art competition, with the prize including an all expenses trip to New York where his work was shown on 34 digital billboards in Times Square.</p>
<p>Dr Maria Bargh, from Victoria University of Wellington, will discuss Māori involvement in the private military security industry and Dr Tahu Kukutai – from Waikato University’s National Institute for Demographic and Economic Analysis (NIDEA), will talk about Māori in Australia, based on evidence from Australia’s 2011 Census.</p>
