<p>Landmark symposium looking at Christchurch’s resilience</p>
<p>August 26, 2013</p>
<p>A landmark symposium looking at Christchurch’s resilience following the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes will be held at the University of Canterbury (UC) tomorrow.</p>
<p>Two leading UC management researchers, Dr Bernard Walker and Associate Professor Nilakant Venkataraman, will talk about how organisations responded in Christchurch.</p>
<p>Planning for a disaster is good practice for businesses – however the disaster often doesn&#39;t align with the plan. Organisations need to be adaptive when this happens, Dr Walker says.</p>
<p>Accounting and information systems postgraduate student Tracy Hatton will outline what happened to Christchurch’s central business district (CBD) retailers.</p>
<p>``With the CBD cordoned for two years, many retailers looked to be out of business. What has really happened to these retailers? I’ll discuss this next week,’’ Hatton says.</p>
<p>Postgraduate student Charlotte Brown will explain the tricky insurance issues and whether they have been a help or hindrance to recovery.</p>
<p>Insurance is an important part of business recovery following a disaster. Brown will say what has been learned about commercial insurance policies from the earthquakes.</p>
<p>Dr John Vargo, co-leader of UC’s Resilient Organisations, will talk about disaster recovery which is a difficult and challenging process.</p>
<p>``Sometimes good things look bad and bad things have a silver lining during this complex process,’’ Dr Vargo says.</p>

<p>Dr Erica Seville, co-leader of UC’s Resilient Organisations, will present 13 leading indicators of an organisation’s resilience and method for tracking an organisation’s resilience over time.</p>
<p>The symposium is open to the public. Representatives from the Canterbury Earthquake Authority (CERA) and the Christchurch City Council plus people from organisations in Auckland and Wellington will be attending.</p>
