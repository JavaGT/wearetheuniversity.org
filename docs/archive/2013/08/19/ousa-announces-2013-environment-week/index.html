<p><strong>OUSA Announces 2013 Environment Week</strong></p>
<p>The Otago University Students’ Association and the University of Otago are this week joining up with several student clubs to promote the OUSA Environment Week.</p>
<p>“The OUSA and the students of Otago are passionate about supporting environmental ideas and this is a week where we can provide good events that highlight issues and give the right information to future decision makers,” said Francisco Hernandez, OUSA President.</p>
<p>The OUSA Environmental Week is in its second year with a full programme of events. Students will have the opportunity to get hands on in everything from creating a sustainability strategy right through to doing a spot of gardening in the campus garden. Along with films there will be speakers, presentations and an Environmental Quiz night held at Re:Fuel bar on campus.</p>
<p>As part of the week the OUSA have set up the Student Sustainability Network Facebook page which will look to be a base for those passionate about the environment and sustainability at Otago and providing a great place for events to be communicated to the wider following.</p>
<p>“Otago is already moving forward with sustainability initiatives and this will be a place that people can connect as we push out ideas and events,” said Hannah Payne-Harker, OUSA Environmental Officer. “The Student Sustainability Network aims to create and maintain an integrated platform for University of Otago environmental groups, which empowers university students to engage with environmental activities and facilitate communication between environmental groups.”</p>
<p>Public and media are welcome at all events unless mentioned in the description.</p>
