<p><strong>Playing its part in Pacific: Lincoln University signs new MOU with PNG</strong></p>
<p>Lincoln University has expanded its involvement in providing educational outcomes to the people of Papua New Guinea by signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the Sohe electorate of Papua New Guinea’s Northern Province.</p>
<p>The new MOU falls under what is known as Lincoln University’s LincWantok programme and mirrors the already well-established relationship the University has with the North Fly electorate in the Western Province; a relationship which provides educational opportunities through the provision of academic programmes, training, research collaborations, consultancy, and sponsorship in such areas as environmental management, tourism, agribusiness and English language instruction.</p>
<p>The MOU captures the priorities of the Sohe District Development Plan in building human resource capabilities, promoting and investing in primary sector enterprises, and creating business opportunities for the local community.</p>
<p>The agreement was signed by Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor, Dr Andrew West, and, from Papua New Guinea, the Vice Minister (Treasury), the Honourable Delilah Gore.</p>
<p>“Lincoln University’s connection with PNG through the LincWantok programme is not only the talk of my community in Northern Province, but the talk of the whole country,” says Delilah Gore.</p>
<p>“Lincoln University can help us develop our land. We have rich volcanic soils, very fertile for growth,” she said. “We grow orchids, and this month in my electorate we are having a floriculture show. In particular, I would like to know how Lincoln University can help us develop a floriculture industry.”</p>
<p>The LincWantok programme is a Lincoln University initiative aimed at reaching communities in the South Pacific such as Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu in the interest of marrying the University’s specialist capabilities with the needs and aspirations of South Pacific communities.</p>
<p>“Our job with the LincWantok programme is to make peoples’ lives better in the South Pacific. It’s that simple,” says Dr Andrew West. “The LincWantok model works. It’s a partnership between equals.”</p>
