<p><strong>Victoria hosts conference to chart China’s global course</strong></p>
<p>China has become the world’s second largest economy within just three decades, and an international conference next week will examine the impact this has had on the rest of the world.</p>
<p>‘China’s Global Course: China, the World Economy and New Zealand’ is a two-day conference presented by Victoria University’s New Zealand Contemporary China Research Centre, which will explore trends and emerging patterns of China’s international trade, investment and activities in other international economic sectors, including New Zealand.</p>
<p>“We have attracted a number of leading international scholars and policy analysts for this conference, who we expect to provoke some interesting discussions,” says Professor Xiaoming Huang, Director, New Zealand Contemporary China Research Centre.</p>
<p>“Although researchers have paid close attention to how China has changed in the process of global economic integration and participation in the institutions of global economic governance, much less attention has been paid to China’s economic impact abroad.</p>
<p>“This conference promises to shed light on how the Chinese economy influences the economy, politics, society and policies of countries around the world, including discussion and debate on how New Zealand fits into the picture.”</p>
<p>Sessions at the conference will cover topics ranging from China’s economic rise, China in world trade, Chinese investment, finance and capital flows, Chinese international business and enterprise, China and international economic governance, as well as a discussion panel on the challenges and opportunities for New Zealand companies doing business with China.</p>
