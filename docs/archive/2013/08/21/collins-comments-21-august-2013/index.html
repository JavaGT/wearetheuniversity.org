<p>It’s fantastic to see so many businesses in our community recognised for their hard work and determination.</p>
<p>I’m thrilled to hear three Papakura businesses have been named as finalists in the Westpac Auckland South Business Awards. Congratulations Best Bars Ltd, Happy Valley NZ Ltd and Spookers Ltd!</p>
<p>You should be very proud of your achievements. Best Bars Ltd is up for four awards including Medium to Large Business of the Year and Happy Valley NZ Ltd is up for three awards including Small Business of the Year. Spookers Ltd has been named as finalist for the Excellence in Innovation Award. I look forward to speaking at the awards dinner on the 27th September.</p>
<p>It’s been a busy few weeks in Papakura and I’ve really enjoyed getting out and about in the electorate, meeting many of you and sharing in your successes. Keeping in touch with you all in the community is the best part of being MP for Papakura.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to host Prime Minister John Key when he visited Papakura this month. We had a fantastic time with the students at St Mary’s Primary School who gave us a very warm welcome.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister thoroughly enjoyed spending time with Rooms 9 and 10 students and reading <em>Herbert the Brave Sea Dog</em>. I thank Principal David Tennent and the St Mary’s community for their hospitality.</p>
<p>We also caught up with the teams at Drury Lane Pharmacy and HEB Construction, who look after civil construction projects, not only in Papakura but nationwide.</p>

<p>I was delighted to open the new Rosehill Satellite Unit at Kereru Park Campus on Friday. The new unit provides special needs classrooms for between 15 and 20 children in mainstream school environments and boosts their confidence and self-esteem by providing education tailored to their needs. Rosehill School satellite units have already been successfully established at Rosehill Intermediate and Rosehill College.</p>
