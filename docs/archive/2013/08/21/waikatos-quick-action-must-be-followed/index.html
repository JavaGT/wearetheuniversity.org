<p>Waikato’s quick action must be followed</p>
<p>Communities across the country must follow the swift action in Waikato to tackle the sale of illegal psychoactive products, says Labour&#39;s Associate Health Spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway</p>
<p>“The first charges under the Psychoactive Substances Act have been laid against an individual illegally selling unapproved psychoactive products. That’s great news for the people of Waikato who are taking control of the sale of these drugs in their community.</p>
<p>&quot;The swift action of the Waikato Police and District Health Board should be followed across the country. They have sent a clear signal to those who refuse to operate within the law that the eyes of their communities are upon them. The message is clear: Work by the rules or face the consequences.</p>
<p>“The 28 day transition period is now behind us. It is time to start weeding out people who do not wish to operate within the new law</p>
<p>“As the regulatory regime develops, it is important for central government, local government, police, health and community agencies to work together to reduce the harm related to psychoactive substances.</p>
<p>“That includes councils establishing local plans to take control of the sale of legal highs in their communities.</p>
<p>“In my view, local plans should address three issues: Capping the number of stores in a community, regulating the location of stores - especially regarding proximity to schools and other education providers - and setting the hours stores may be open.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s why, as a local MP, I am calling on my own council to exercise its right to adopt a local plan for legal highs,” says Iain Lees-Galloway.</p>
<p>Iain Lees-Galloway has started a petition asking the Palmerston North City Council to adopt a local plan for legal highs (available here). It has received the support of 560 people to date.</p>
