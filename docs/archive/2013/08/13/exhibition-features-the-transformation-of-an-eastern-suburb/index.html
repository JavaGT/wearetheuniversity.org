<p><strong>Major UC exhibition to feature the transformation of an eastern suburb</strong></p>
<p><strong>August 13, 2013</strong></p>
<p>A major University of Canterbury (UC) exhibition, <em>Thx 4 the Memories,</em> featuring the 2010 and 2011 Christchurch earthquakes will open in the city next week.</p>
<p>The exhibition is the first stage of a larger 10 year Place in Time project documenting the red zoned eastern suburb of Avonside as it transitions from Christchurch&#39;s second oldest suburban area to wet / park land.</p>
<p>As a Place in Time and Christchurch Arts Festival exhibition, the exhibition next week will feature edited down versions of comprehensive oral histories of Avonside residents.</p>
<p>These oral histories were compiled and written by UC senior arts lecturer Glenn Busch and are accompanied by portraits by Bridgit Anderson and landscape images by photography lecturer Tim Veling.</p>
<p><em>Thx 4 the Memories</em> will be mounted along Worcester Boulevard, between the Arts Centre&#39;s market square and Cathedral Square, on 50 double sided outdoor frames.</p>
<p>``The show will lead the public back to the heart of the city. The exhibition can be seen in direct relation to the city&#39;s dramatically altered physical landscape, plus it will extend past the entrance of the Christchurch City Council buildings,’’ Veling says.</p>
<p>``It will give the people of Avonside an assertive and positive collective voice that in essence is representative of the broader situation in other red zoned Christchurch suburbs.</p>
<p>``The work speaks of the psychological, physical and social implications of what was the biggest peace time disaster in New Zealand&#39;s history.</p>
<p>``It carries an essential message for the rest of New Zealand in that the situation in Christchurch has set a precedent for how we as a country can handle future disasters.’’</p>
<p><em>Thx 4 the Memories</em> exhibition is also available to travel to other centres and forms part of the Christchurch Arts Festival. It opens August 22 and will close September 22.</p>
<p>Since 2000, Place in Time the Christchurch Documentary Project has been recording the city of Christchurch and a cross-section of its people through photography, oral history and documentary writing. The project has now produced an extensive archive including a number of exhibitions, books and educational projects. Place in Time is housed at the UC’s School of Fine Arts.</p>
