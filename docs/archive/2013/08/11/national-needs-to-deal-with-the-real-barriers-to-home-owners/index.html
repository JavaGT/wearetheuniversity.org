<p><strong>Sunday, 11 August 2013, 2:49 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>David<br>SHEARER<br>Labour Leader<br>11 August 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>National needs to deal with the real barriers to home ownership</strong></p>
<p>Tweaks to KiwiSaver will be little consolation to the thousands of would-be home owners searching this weekend’s property pages for an affordable home, Labour Leader David Shearer says.</p>
<p>“Changes to Kiwisaver rules and an increase in price caps are worth supporting, but much more is needed to take the heat out of the property market.</p>
<p>&quot;After five years in office and five years of soaring house prices, National’s offering today is disappointing. Prospective home buyers would have been anticipating a major announcement rather than more tinkering.</p>
<p>&quot;National needs to address the two major drivers of house prices - the shortage of affordable homes and speculators. It&#39;s time to stop dancing around the problem and offer some real solutions. First home buyers need affordable options.</p>
<p>Labour’s KiwiBuild policy will build 100,000 affordable homes over 10 years to increase the supply of entry-level housing.</p>
<p>“I am also determined to reduce speculation-driven demand in our housing market. Labour will restrict sales to overseas speculators and clamp down on speculators here through a capital gains tax on houses bought over and above their own home.</p>
<p>&quot;Kiwis should be at the head of the queue when it comes to home ownership. My plan will give first home buyers a realistic chance to get into an affordable home that they can call their own.&quot;  </p>
