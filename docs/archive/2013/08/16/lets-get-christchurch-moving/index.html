<p>16 August 2013  MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Let’s get Christchurch moving</strong></p>
<p>Urgent action is needed to get Christchurch moving, says Labour’s Christchurch Transport spokesperson Megan Woods.</p>
<p>“Earthquake Minister Gerry Brownlee has revealed that he doesn’t think Canterbury’s much awaited central city transport plan is a priority.</p>
<p>“This claim is nonsense. Anyone trying to get around Christchurch will tell you the roads are not coping, they are messy, and they are slow-moving.</p>
<p>“The Minister was supposed to have passed Canterbury’s transport plan by Cabinet five months ago. In response to questioning, the Minister’s office claimed that the rebuild was simply <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/transport/9044784/Transport-plan-hits-speed-bump">not at the point where the transport plan was considered vital to the recovery.</a></p>
<p>“There are some good initiatives in the draft plan. Along with expected upgrades to our roads there are also genuine attempts to build a 21st century city that sees public transport, walking and cycling as real transport options.</p>
<p>“An approved transport plan is not a nice to have, it’s fundamental to the rebuild of the city.</p>
<p>“While people are frustrated with road works they do agree our roads need to be fixed. What they shouldn’t have to put up with is work moving at a snail’s pace.</p>
<p>“The reality is that residential and commercial development is occurring all over the city and we need a transport plan to match that. People need to be able to move around their neighbourhoods and their city. The CCDU transport plan is the key to this transport network.”</p>
