<p><strong>OUSA and OPSA Announce Double Rainbow</strong></p>
<p>On Monday the 19th at 10:30am, the OUSA and OPSA Presidents will be meeting to sign a memorandum of understanding between their organisations will focus on the extension of OUSA’s Queer Support services to Otago Polytechnic students.</p>
<p>The agreement will allow queer and questioning Otago Polytechnic students to have the opportunity to seek specific help, advice and advocacy around issues related to sex, sexuality and gender identity.</p>
<p>“This MOU in many ways recognises and formalises the current relationship that the two associations have in regards to these services.” Said Neill Ballantyne, OUSA Queer Support Coordinator, “It also seeks to clarify how the arrangement operates and means that the services will be more widely promoted on the polytechnic campus.”</p>
<p>“This is a very encouraging step for queer and questioning students which will mean that more people are aware of the support available to them.” Said Mr. Ballantyne, “It should also mean that both of our campuses are more warm and welcoming to the rainbow communities.”</p>
<p>OUSA Queer support provides one-to-one pastoral care and advice, peer support and group support. They also work to raise awareness of queer issues through a range of events and educational seminars. The aim is to create a more queer-friendly campus through staff training programmes, policy development and advocacy.</p>
<p><em>The word queer in this context is used as a composite term which includes all forms of sex, sexualities and gender identities.</em></p>
