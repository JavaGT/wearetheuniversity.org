<p><strong>Linguistics postgraduate wins UC thesis-in three-minutes award</strong></p>
<p><strong>August 16, 2013</strong></p>
<p>A linguistics PhD student studying English accents in non-native speakers has earned $5000 for winning the University of Canterbury’s fourth annual Thesis in Three annual event.</p>
<p>Ksenia Gnevsheva spoke at a packed lecture theatre on campus last night for three minutes about non-native English accents. Her prize money will be spent on research-related issues.</p>
<p>Biological sciences student Olivia Burge won $2000 for coming second with her presentation on regeneration within the Awarua-Waituna wetland complex, while mechanical engineering student Steven Banerjee received $1000 for third place following his talk on parallel cellular chips.</p>
<p>Fifteen students who reached the final were each given just three minutes to explain the what, why and how of their thesis. Funding was provided by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor’s Office.</p>
<p>Organiser of the event Professor Lucy Johnston said all the presentations were outstanding which made a difficult job for judges Andrew Ramsay (UC Students Association Vice-President); Associate Professor Janet Carter and Emeritus Professor John Burrows.</p>
