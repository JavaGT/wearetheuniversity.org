<p><strong>Media Release</strong></p>
<p><strong>McClay says Kawerau to get $15.6m school facilities</strong></p>
<p>Local MP Todd McClay has welcomed the Government’s $15.6 million investment for education in Kawerau.</p>
<p>“Tarawera High School plays an important part in supporting the local community and its young people and I am glad to have played a role in attracting more than $15.6 million to build new facilities on the existing Tarawera High School site.</p>
<p>“Kawerau students deserve the best educational opportunities we can offer them and this announcement of fresh funding will deliver on this opportunity,” Mr McClay said.</p>
<p>“With the merge of the College and Intermediate at the start of this year, there was some concern among the community in regards to education. In response I’ve been working alongside school principal Helen Tuhoro and Mayor Malcolm Campbell to ensure the best outcome possible.</p>
<p>&quot;Whilst an initial $6m had been committed at the time of the merger further investigation showed that the existing buildings were in many cases beyond repair. This increase of funds to $15.6m means that we can now get on and build a school Kawerau can be proud of,&quot; Mr McClay said.</p>
<p>“This latest announcement by the Government will work to ensure our students have modern facilities to meet the challenges of the 21st century.</p>
<p>“The school will now be completely refurbished including the installation of essential weather tight and earthquake resilient infrastructure. Facilities such as the library and gym will be upgraded and a further $880,000 will be available for new furniture, equipment and technology,” Mr McClay said.</p>
<p>Mr McClay said that he would like to thank Ministers Parata and Kaye for their support of education in Kawerau and Principal Tuhoro and Mayor Campbell for their commitment to young people in the town.</p>
