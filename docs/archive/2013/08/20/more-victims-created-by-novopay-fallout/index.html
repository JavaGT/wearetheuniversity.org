<p><strong>More Victims Created By Novopay Fallout</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First says the flawed Novopay system is creating new problems that are impacting on children’s learning in the classroom.</p>
<p>Today marks the first anniversary of the very expensive Novopay payroll system and Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says Fixit Minister Joyce is blind to the very real issues the debacle is causing.</p>
<p>“The principal of a small rural school has told me it is unable to fund resources for students because the Board of Trustees can’t sign off last year’s financial reports.</p>
<p>“Without audited annual accounts, schools can’t apply for additional funding from charities and grants which are vital to top up the insufficient state funding.</p>
<p>“That school is now financially stressed attempting to maintain current programmes let alone develop their ICT programme or even fix the sandpit.</p>
<p>“When a principal is not able to purchase a vital resource for students something is seriously wrong.</p>
<p>“This is another side effect of Novopay and it is hitting the front line of education. It must be fixed fast,” says Ms Martin.</p>
