<p><strong>Thursday, 15 August 2013, 10:39 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato">University of Waikato</a></strong></p>
<p>15 August, 2013</p>
<p><strong>New Zealander of the Year to headline Kīngitanga Day</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand of the year Distinguished Professor Dame Anne Salmond will be one of the keynote speakers for this year’s Kīngitanga Day, taking place 12 September at the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>Dame Anne, a Professor of Māori Studies and Anthropology at the University of Auckland, was announced as the 2013 New Zealander of the Year for her services in Māori and Pacific studies.</p>
<p>She will be joined by Ngāi Tahu head Sir Mark Solomon, who has been announced as the second keynote speaker for the day.</p>
<p>Kīngitanga Day is an annual event at the University of Waikato and features prominent academics, leaders, and esteemed kaumātua from across the country taking part in lectures, seminars and other events.</p>
<p>Professor Linda Smith, Pro Vice-Chancellor Māori at the University, says Kīngitanga Day is an opportunity not only to engage widely with the public and the community, but to showcase the cultural diversity of the University.</p>
<p>“While there will be central activities that do focus on the relationships with the Kīngitanga and with Māori communities more generally, the programme is open to reflect the University’s diversity and its various expressions of excellence across all areas,” she says.</p>
<p>“We have a unique relationship with Waikato-Tainui and the iwi of our catchment area, we have a high proportion of Māori students, and we’re well known for our strengths in applying Māori language and knowledge across our Faculties. These attributes are a part of our Māori distinctiveness and cultural diversity, and are part of the reason why we celebrate Kīngitanga Day.”</p>

<p>Lectures, seminars, and performances will be running throughout the day at various venues on campus.</p>
<p>There will also be workshops on haka and raranga (traditional Māori weaving) on offer.</p>
<p>Kīngitanga Day kicks-off at 10am, Thursday 12 September campus wide. For more information visit <a href="http://www.waikato.ac.nz/events/kingitanga">www.waikato.ac.nz/events/kingitanga</a></p>
