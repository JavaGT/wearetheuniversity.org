<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong></p>

<p><strong>Victoria researcher solves 40 year-old math problem</strong></p>
<p>A Victoria University of Wellington mathematician has experienced his own eureka moment, solving a 40 year-old mathematical problem.</p>
<p>Professor Geoff Whittle, from Victoria’s School of Mathematics, Statistics and Operations Research, has been working with colleagues Professor Jim Geelen (Canada) and Professor Bert Gerards (Netherlands) to solve a problem posed by the famous mathematician and philosopher Gian-Carlo Rota in 1970.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the trio realised that, after more than 15 years of work, they had achieved all the essential ingredients to prove Rota’s Conjecture.</p>
<p>Geoff visited the United Kingdom last month to break news of the discovery to mathematics colleagues at a conference where he was a guest speaker.</p>
<p>Rota’s Conjecture relates to a specialised area of mathematics known as matroid theory, a modern form of geometry, which Geoff specialises in.</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on distance and angles, matroid theory investigates properties of structures which don’t change under projection—for example, whether or not three points are always on a line, or four points are on a plane.</p>
<p>The theory investigates geometric structures that can be completely different from those in our world, and Rota’s Conjecture is a way of using mathematics to recognise these alternative structures.</p>
<p>“I like to compare it to Kafka’s Metamorphosis story, where a man wakes up and realises he has transformed into an insect—the way he views the world changes entirely,” says Geoff. </p>

<p>“Matroid theory is all about visualising a world of new geometrical structures and developing ways of describing the big, overarching structures which would emerge.”</p>
<p>Although he has been working on proving Rota’s Conjecture for a long period of time, Geoff says the hard work will really begin now, as the team starts writing up the results of its work.</p>
<p>“Resolving Rota’s Conjecture is really special, and the product of many, many years of collaborative work.</p>
<p>“Now, we have a lot of writing to do, which I expect to take several more years—as well as many hundreds of pages of journal articles.”</p>
<p>“It’s a little bit like discovering a new mountain—we’ve crossed many hurdles to reach a new destination and we have returned scratched, bloodied and bruised from the arduous journey—we now need to create a pathway so others can reach it.” </p>
<p>Head of School Dr Peter Donelan is also excited about the news, which he believes will attract international recognition.</p>
<p>“This will be regarded as one of the outstanding mathematical achievements in recent years,” he says.</p>
<p>Geoff has been based at Victoria University since 1992, when he joined the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Operations Research as a lecturer. He was promoted to Reader in 1997 and to Professor in 2001.</p>
<p>Geoff is recognised as a world leader in the field of discrete mathematics. He has spent time as a visiting research fellow at Merton College, Oxford and is a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand. In 1996, his achievements were recognised with the New Zealand Mathematical Society’s Research Award.</p>
