<p>NZ children lose again</p>
<p>Today’s decision by the Court of Appeal dismissing an appeal by the Child Poverty Action Group condemns children whose parents are without employment to on-going poverty, Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said today.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeal has dismissed an appeal by the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) challenging part of the Working for Families package introduced in 2004.</p>
<p>“The in-work tax credit (IWTC) has lifted thousands of children out of poverty but hasn’t helped the one in five children whose parents study or are on a benefit,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>“Children deserve better treatment in the law and in policy than this decision gives them.</p>
<p>“I am very disappointed. CPAG have been unrelenting advocates for children and we support them 100 per cent.</p>
<p>“While the courts may think the discriminatory impact of the on-benefit rule it is not out of proportion to the goal of incentivising people into work. We don’t,” Mrs Tūrei said.</p>
<p>“We would extend the in -work tax credits to the children of beneficiary and student families.</p>
<p>“234,000 Kiwi kids live in families supported by a benefit and don&#39;t get the IWTC. The IWTC would deliver an extra $60 a week for our poorest families with 1 to 3 children, and $90 a week for those with 4 children or more.</p>
<p>“We will continue to campaign against discrimination and for equity for children and their families regardless of today’s decision by the Court of Appeal, said Mrs Turei.</p>
<p>“We will put children at the heart of politics, not on the periphery.</p>
