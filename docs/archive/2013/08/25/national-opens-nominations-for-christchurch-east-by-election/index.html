<p>Media Statement       <br> <br><strong>National opens nominations for Christchurch East By-election</strong><br> <br>Nominations for the National Party’s candidate to contest the upcoming Christchurch East By-election open tomorrow (Monday 26 August).<br> <br>National Party Canterbury Westland Regional Chair Roger Bridge says the Christchurch East seat has been held by Labour since 1922 and notes that a sitting Government has never won a by-election in a seat it does not hold.<br> <br>&quot;But here in the Canterbury region the National-led Government has a good story to tell with its focus on the rebuild, a strong growing economy, and improving public services for our families.&quot;<br> <br>Mr Bridge says he expects a talented field of prospective candidates will put themselves forward for selection. <br> <br>“National has never held the seat, so we enter into this challenge with our eyes open.  But we will run a strong local campaign, founded on the firm belief that we have the best plan to improve the lives of Christchurch East locals and New Zealand as a whole.&quot;<br> <br>Mr Bridge says the National-led Government has provided unwavering support for Canterbury since the devastating earthquakes and the communities are beginning to see positive results as the rebuild gathers momentum.<br> <br>“We recognise history is not on our side, but never enter a contest aiming for second place.”<br> <br>Nominations close at 5pm on Wednesday 4 September and are welcome from National Party members.  The successful candidate is likely to be announced in the middle of September.<br> <br>ENDS</p>
