<p>Asset sales must stop now</p>
<p>The National government must immediately stop the asset sale programme until a referendum is held to let New Zealanders have their say on the future of their assets, Grant Robertson Labour Deputy Leader said.</p>
<p>&quot;The success of the petition to hold a referendum on asset sales is a clear indication to the government that it should put a halt to its sale of our public assets.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders deserve the chance to have their say on the future of our energy companies and airline. Any further move by the government to sell goes against the democratic process that is now under way.</p>
<p>&quot;In the 2011 election, more people voted for parties who were against the sale of assets than those who supported the sales. John Key cannot claim a mandate to sell assets. He should let New Zealanders have their say.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to pay tribute to the thousands of people who got signatures for this referendum. This is their victory. I want to particularly acknowledge Roy Reid from Grey Power for his leadership, and for all those in the Keep Our Assets coalition.</p>
<p>&quot;These assets were built up by former generations of New Zealanders for the benefit of future generations. They should be kept in public ownership, so that we all benefit, not just the 2% who can afford to buy shares. Today we have the opportunity to send the clear message to National that New Zealanders want to keep our assets.&quot;</p>
