<p>Spotlight on Kapiti for Writers Read event</p>
<p>Writers Thom Conroy, Hamish Clayton and Lawrence Patchett will explore Kapiti in history and fiction at the next Writers Read evening.</p>
<p>The event will be held at the Palmerston North City Library on Wednesday September 11, and at Massey University’s Wellington campus on Thursday September 12.</p>
<p>Massey Senior Lecturer in Creative Writing Dr Thom Conroy, who is one of the guest readers, says the series this year has been a great success, with a diverse and exciting line-up across the University’s three campuses.</p>
<p>Next week’s event will feature readings and interactions between all three writers as well as exchanges with the chairs – Massey lecturer Philip Steer in Palmerston North and senior tutor Tina Makereti in Wellington – and questions and answers from the audience.</p>
<p>“Usually the Writers Read events have single speakers, but we thought we would mix it up a little for this event and group three writers together for what we hope is a new mix of reading and conversation on a topic that all of our work shares — the historical role of the Kapiti and the surrounding region,” Dr Conroy says.</p>
<p>“Hamish Clayton and Lawrence Patchett are two writers whom I admire for their very different approaches to historical subjects. In the case of Clayton, history is rendered in mythological and deeply poetic terms. Patchett, on the other hand, seems to be out to ‘normalise’ history and make its characters realistic in a way that resists romanticisation.”</p>
