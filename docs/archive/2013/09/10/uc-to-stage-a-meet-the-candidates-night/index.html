<p>UC to stage a meet the candidates’ night with elections critical to Christchurch’s future</p>
<p>September 10, 2013</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury (UC) will stage a speed-voting meet the candidates event for all Christchurch City council election candidates in the run up to next month’s local body elections.</p>
<p>The September 25 event, which is open to the public, is being organised by UC’s School of Political and Social Sciences and will be held in UC’s C2 lecture theatre.</p>
<p>Organiser Dr Bronwyn Hayward says the elections are critical for the city’s future.</p>
<p>``Never before in our history have we faced so many issues and Christchurch is at a crossroads. The rebuild of the city is a major event in New Zealand’s history,’’ Dr Hayward says.</p>
<p>Three years on from the earthquakes, Christchurch will recover and become a more multicultural, open, caring and innovative city. Robust elections next month could really help.</p>
<p>``We can reclaim a more active, more compassionate and more critical perspective on democracy and resilience. Drawing on our community’s experiences, I argue that the future for Christchurch could be more inclusive, more creative and more socially just.</p>
<p>``It is incumbent on us to consider how can we maintain and sustain democracy in a dynamic and changing world,’’ Dr Hayward says.</p>
