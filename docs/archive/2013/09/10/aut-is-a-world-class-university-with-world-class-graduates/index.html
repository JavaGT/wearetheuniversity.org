<p><strong>Tuesday, 10 September 2013, 1:31 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/AUT_University">AUT University</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>AUT is a world-class university with world-class graduates</strong></p>
<p>The 2013 set of QS world rankings has placed AUT University in the top 500 for the second year, improving its position by twenty places. To be once again in the top 500 is a great indicator of the teaching, learning and research that is being undertaken at the university.</p>
<p>International rankings are important domestically, but even more so for off-shore students when weighing up their study options. Being ranked does make AUT an attractive prospect, and the growth in international student numbers is beneficial to Auckland and New Zealand.</p>
<p>“To have jumped up 20 places in this prestigious international ranking is an accomplishment for AUT as this recognition is proof of the high quality and consistency of the education offered here and our outstanding graduates,” Says Derek McCormack, AUT University Vice Chancellor.</p>
<p>There are currently over 10,000 universities in the world of which the QS system considers 3000 and ranks the top 500. For all of New Zealand’s comprehensive universities to now be in the top 500 (5% of universities world-wide) is a notable achievement.</p>
<p>The QS World University Rankings® have been in existence since 2004 and the QS Intelligence Unit was formed in 2008 to meet the increasing public interest for comparative data on universities and organisations, and the growing demand for institutions to develop deeper insight into their competitive environment.</p>
<p>Auckland University of Technology is a university for the changing world, an increasingly powerful force for learning and discovery. A contemporary, connected and relevant study destination, it has differentiated itself through its commitment to widening university access and participation, and its engagement with business, industry and communities.</p>

<p>• AUT, New Zealand’s fastest growing university, has an enrolment of around 19,000 equivalent full-time students across three campuses – City, North Shore and Manukau.</p>
<p>• QS World Rankings ranks AUT in the top 500 (or top 5%) of the world’s universities.</p>
<p>• The 2012 Australasian Survey of Student Engagement (AUSSE) report found that AUT outperformed all three benchmark groups on all measures of student engagement, including academic challenge, active learning, student and staff interactions, supportive learning environment, enriching educational experiences and work integrated learning.</p>
