<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>26 September 2013  </p>
<p><strong>Kiwi Sailors Fought Bravely But Bigger Resources Won</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First has praised the Kiwi sailors who came within a whisker of winning back the America’s Cup but in the end lost to big money and home team rules.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters says hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders around the world tried to “will” the Kiwi yacht to the finish mark and to their credit Team New Zealand fought to the end.</p>
<p>“It was one of the moments when we must remember that for a small nation we are up there with the best in the world and credit must be given to everyone associated with the cup project.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says it’s also time to reflect on what we are capable of achieving and he points out that the winning boat was actually built in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“A Kiwi boat won the America’s Cup, but with an owner from the USA,” says Mr Peters.<br><strong>ENDS</strong> </p>
