<p><strong>Further Inaccurate Data from National Standards</strong></p>
<p>The Government is failing to learn from its past mistakes of publishing inaccurate data at the expense of students says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>An independent study commissioned by the Ministry of Education has found teachers&#39; use of the national standards last year lacked dependability.</p>
<p>Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says with no way of knowing how many of last year&#39;s national standards results are correct, the Government is repeating the NCEA experience of a decade of inaccurate data publication.</p>
<p>“Can we expect another ten years of flawed data with national standards?</p>
<p>“This will have a major impact on another generation of students, their families and place further stress on teaching staff.</p>
<p>“The Government ignored warnings from teachers and unions not to publish the data, and this report adds to their concerns.</p>
<p>“It is alarming that the so-called evidence will enable the Minister to challenge the professional judgement of teachers and school leaders.</p>
<p>“Will this report provide justification for Minister Parata to put the Progress and Consistency Tool (PaCT) back on the mandatory table after her earlier about-face?</p>
<p>“The published data does nothing at all for individual student wellbeing, progress and achievement.</p>
<p>“Instead it could be used as ammunition and fired at individual teachers under the guise of performance pay,” warns Ms Martin.</p>
