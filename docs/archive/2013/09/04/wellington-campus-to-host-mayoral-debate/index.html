<p>Wellington campus to host mayoral debate</p>
<p>Wellington is about to go to the polls to choose its next mayor and Massey University, in conjunction with the Dominion Post, is hosting a debate to let the public hear all six candidates’ views on the key issues.</p>
<p>Two earlier events organised by Massey’s Wellington campus and the daily newspaper, narrowed the key challenges facing the city down to infrastructure, amalgamation into a ‘super city,’ the Wellington brand and the city’s ability to attract investment and talent.</p>
<p>From 5.30pm on Thursday September 12, hear what incumbent Celia Wade-Brown, and her challengers for the mayoral chains, Rob Goulden, John Morrison, Karunanidhi Muthu, Jack Yan and Nicola Young, have to say about these issues to help voters decide who they want to lead Wellington for the next three years.</p>
<p>The debate is being held with support from the Wellington Employers’ Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey, who is chairing the series of debates, says each of the events has progressively pointed a way forward for the city.</p>
<p>“If the first Wellington debate threw up many ideas about how Wellington could succeed and the second one showed us the way these ideas could be implemented, it’s now up to the mayoral candidates to tell the city what they intend to do.”</p>
<p>Wellington Mayoral Debate: 5.30pm, Thursday September 12, Museum Building, Massey University, Entrance D via Tasman St.</p>
