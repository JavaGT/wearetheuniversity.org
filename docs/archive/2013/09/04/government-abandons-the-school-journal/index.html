<p><strong>Tracey Martin MP</strong></p>
<p>Spokesperson for Education<br>4 September 2013  </p>
<p><strong>Government Abandons the School Journal</strong></p>
<p>The Government has forced the closure of Learning Media by making it compete unfairly in a tight competitive publishing market says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>Today Learning Media announced it is no longer financially viable and is to be wound down.</p>
<p>Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says the School Journal is a Kiwi institution and is under threat of being relegated to the scrap heap in spite of Government assurances.</p>
<p>“Learning Media was identified in the Digital Literacy Inquiry as having a valuable role in ensuring local resources were developed not only in the area of the written word but in the digital development of educational applications.</p>
<p>“The removal of the government contract assurance has thrust Learning Media directly into a fiercely competitive marketplace while requiring them to provide free resources to the education sector.</p>
<p>“It is a sad day not only for Learning Media staff, but all the writers and contributors to the School Journal and the thousands of children who may now miss out on growing up with this fabulous publication,” says Ms Martin.</p>
