<p><strong>UC economists to give public talk on money</strong></p>
<p>September 4, 2013</p>
<p>University of Canterbury (UC) economists Stephen Hickson and Eric Crampton will give a public talk in the Christchurch central city tomorrow night about money.</p>
<p>Hickson will ask people at the Physics Room in the CBD to think about money and why society has money.</p>
<p>&quot;How did we end up with the money system we have? For something to be useful as money, what must it be able to do?</p>
<p>&quot;In order to do these things, what must money be like? In today’s modern economy, money is really just bits of paper but it can cause a couple of big problems.</p>
<p>&quot;One is when everyone decides to go and get their money out of the bank at the same time and there just isn’t enough to go around.</p>
<p>&quot;The other is when a government misbehaves and decides to print too much money, usually to try and pay its own bills.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Crampton will help people who may be bamboozled by economics and want to understand how it all works.</p>
<p>&quot;I’ll explain the gap between economics the public understands and what economists know about economic policy issues.&quot;</p>
