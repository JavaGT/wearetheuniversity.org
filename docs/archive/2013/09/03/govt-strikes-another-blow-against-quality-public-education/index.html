<p><strong>Government strikes another blow against quality public education</strong></p>
<p>The Government is continuing its disastrous and unfair education policies with today’s release of further ropey and misguided National Standards data.</p>
<p>“National Standards are unfair and misleading. They do not represent a real picture of a school or community’s education,” says NZEI National President Judith Nowotarski.</p>
<p>“Pitching schools against each other is the wrong path to take in order to address the causes of educational under achievement.</p>
<p>“The Government knows that last year’s data was inaccurate and that means that it is impossible to assess any improvement in learning across a school or a region.</p>
<p>“Publishing poor quality data in ever increasing detail doesn’t make it any more reliable.<br>“This is another stage in a seriously harmful education policy. Unfortunately the big losers will be students who are struggling and those from poorer backgrounds.</p>
<p>“It is particularly concerning that the Minister is claiming the data is valuable when the Government has admitted that it has not been moderated, is not accurate, and is not a true reflection of how well a school is performing</p>
<p>“There is even a disclaimer on the Ministry of Education’s own website advising that care is needed when considering the data. The Ministry itself says this data should not be used as a basis for ranking schools as this would be misleading and harmful.</p>
<p>“So why is the Minister of Education continuing with this misleading and harmful policy?”</p>
