<p>Students win big in global design awards</p>
<p>Nine Massey design graduates have won international recognition in the Red Dot global design awards.</p>
<p>One designer, 22 year-old Aucklander Stacey Kenny, is among only three in the world to be nominated for Red Dot’s top prize, the Luminary Award.</p>
<p>College of Creative Arts Pro Vice-Chancellor, Professor Claire Robinson, says “we already knew we had some phenomenal talent in this country, but this level of success is unprecedented. The international Red Dot awards are a distinctive seal of quality that recognises our Wellington School of Design as a world leader, and sets our students apart on the global stage.”</p>
<p>Along with Ms Kenny, three other Massey graduates were placed in the industrial design categories, putting them in the top 6 per cent of nearly 4400 entries from 56 countries. A further five Massey graduates were placed in the communication design categories (judged in Berlin), which received 6800 entries from 43 countries.</p>
<p>She will learn whether she has won the Luminary award at a ceremony in Singapore in late October. Ms Kenny’s Nest Urban Hen House entry was the final project for her design degree at Massey.</p>
<p>The design allows spent hens to recover their productivity and lay eggs for many years after being retired from commercial farms. A rotating cage gives the hens access to fresh grass, while the light in the roosting perch can be adjusted to help the birds, which are typically light-sensitive after a life as a caged battery hen.</p>

<p>Ms Kenny estimates that the average life of a battery hen could be doubled to eight years through the use of her design.</p>
<p>Since completing the design last November, the Auckland-based designer has been employed as an industrial engineer at door manufacturer CS For Doors. She is looking forward to attending the awards ceremony in Singapore.</p>
<p>“It’s an awesome opportunity to meet people in the design industry. I’ve been told it’s a great place to get your name out there.”</p>
