<p><strong>OUSA Supports NZUSA Student Food Bank Findings</strong></p>
<p>The Otago University Students’ Association supports the New Zealand tertiary students’ calls that student finances are at a crisis point.</p>
<p>The latest OUSA information supports the findings that have come to light as a result of a survey recently conducted by New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).</p>
<p>The survey, conducted by NZUSA of 17 students’ organisations highlight the stresses that students are under as they bear the brunt of rising living costs set against a sinking lid on allowances.</p>
<p>“OUSA has seen the impact these cuts have made to students and we’ve seen a 12% increase in demand for food bank packages so far this year compared to 2012.” Said Francisco Hernandez, OUSA President. “Students are being hit hard by the tight job environment in Otago and the cuts to student support.”</p>
<p>More than 4000 food parcels or grocery vouchers were distributed last year and NZUSA estimates that Tertiary Education Institutions (TEI’s) also distributed as much as $4 million last year in emergency assistance.</p>
<p>“These figures are too high,” says Pete Hodkinson, President of New Zealand Union of Student Associations, “The current Government has made cuts to student support every year since 2008, and while the government claims that they are each small cuts, the cumulative effect on students who struggle to make ends meet is seriously underestimated.”</p>

<p>Problems for students have also been caused by excessive delays by the government organisation that distributes student allowances and loans, Studylink. NZUSA’s research shows that Studylink simply hasn’t had the systems or the people to cope and students have borne the brunt of this.</p>
<p>“Studylink has been a real issue for a number of years, and OUSA has worked successfully to have Studylink on campus as a trial this year, an initiative we will be pushing to happen again in 2014.” Says Hernandez.</p>
<p>The NZUSA Food bank and Hardship survey shows that the support available is genuinely needed, with financial help often tied to receiving budgetary advice and other support.</p>
<p>“It’s not that students make choices – other than to study – that get them into trouble, it’s just that student support isn’t enough to live on and more and more students are struggling to find sufficient work to cover the shortfall,” said Hodkinson.</p>
<p>As well as the food banks and hardship provision, and despite their own precarious positions since the advent of voluntary membership, students’ associations are looking to expand their activities to help support desperate students.</p>
<p>“OUSA is currently serving free breakfasts daily which this week have seen up to 50 students attending each day,” said Hernandez, “We’ve also secured a contract with a local company to sell frozen home style meals for $5.00 a meal which have been really popular.”</p>
