<p><strong>Greens celebrate suffrage with Generation Y</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party is encouraging a new generation of 18 to 20 year old women to use their power as we celebrate the 120th anniversary of New Zealand becoming the first country in the world to grant women the right to vote.</p>
<p>As part of its “Love Democracy, Use your Power” campaign, Green MPs have spent the last month visiting schools and universities speaking to senior students and encouraging them to use their power and get involved.</p>
<p>“We think Suffrage Day is a huge cause of celebration for women in New Zealand and all throughout the world,” Green Party women’s spokesperson Jan Logie said.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure young people know that having a voice and participating is what makes a democracy really work,” Ms Logie said.</p>
<p>“As the only party in Parliament with more women MPs than men, the Green Party knows that in order to have a democratic voice, women need to use their power and get involved in the issues they care about.</p>
<p>“Women have fought and won many battles but it’s too early to rest on our laurels as some big issues still remain.</p>
<p>“The battle for pay equity, and adequate pay parental leave are real, contemporary issues that women face today.</p>
<p>“When women’s hourly earnings are on average 12 to 15 percent less than men, we still need to fight for equal and equitable pay.</p>
<p>“When women make up 51 percent of the population but only 32 percent of the MPs in Parliament the fight for full suffrage continues.</p>

<p>“When one in three women still experience psychological or physical abuse from their partners we still have much work to do to keep them safe.</p>
<p>“It’s important that we all continue the proud tradition of the suffragettes by making sure we stand up for the things we feel strongly about. We don’t all need to be politicians, there are lots of ways to participate in our democracy and stand up for the things we believe in,” said Ms Logie.</p>
