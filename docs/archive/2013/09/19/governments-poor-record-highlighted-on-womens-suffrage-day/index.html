<p><strong>Thursday, 19 September 2013, 5:01 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Sue<br>MORONEY<br>Women’s Affairs Spokesperson</p>
<p>19 September 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Government’s poor record highlighted on Women’s Suffrage Day</strong><br>To mark Suffrage Day Labour has put the Government&#39;s poor record on supporting women, particularly in the areas of Labour, Justice and Tertiary Education, under the spotlight in Parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear that women are being disadvantaged by laws and policies being implemented in these areas by National and Jo Goodhew, as Minister of Women&#39;s Affairs, is allowing it to happen,&quot; Labour&#39;s Spokesperson for Women&#39;s Affairs, Sue Moroney said.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only has her Ministry stopped providing gender implication statements on proposed law changes going to Cabinet, but she also is looking the other way while Simon Bridges prepares to meddle with a court decision on equal pay for women already on low wages.</p>
<p>&quot;It is shocking that the Minister admitted today that she isn&#39;t giving the Minister of Labour any advice on his plan to intervene in the Kristine Bartlett equal pay decision. This has been a breakthrough decision for women on low pay and Ms Goodhew should be involved.</p>
<p>“This Government doesn&#39;t care about the impact an eight per cent interest rate on legal aid bills will have on women fighting domestic violence and custody issues, either.</p>
<p>“And it is in denial about the impact its policies are having on women&#39;s ability to participate in industry training and tertiary education.</p>
<p>“New Zealand was the first country in the world to give women the vote. Labour gave New Zealand its first woman MP and its first elected woman Prime Minister.</p>
<p>“That a National government, 120 years on from that first vote, is still legislating to the detriment of more than half of the population is nothing to celebrate.”</p>
