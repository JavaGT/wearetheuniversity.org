<p><strong>Collins Comments</strong></p>
<p>With local elections just around the corner, it’s time to start thinking about who we want to lead our cities, districts and regions.</p>
<p>Election papers will be sent out from today and voters will have until noon on Saturday 12 October to vote for mayors, councillors and members of our local and community boards, licensing trusts and other organisations.</p>
<p>Voting can be quick and simple if taken one step at a time. Being aware of who is running and what they stand for can also simplify the process for when your voting papers do arrive.</p>
<p>Aucklanders have 17 mayoral candidates to choose from, as well as councillors to represent the 20 wards that make up our city, so there are plenty of candidates to consider.</p>
<p>It’s fitting that this year’s local elections coincide with the 120th anniversary of Suffrage Day, celebrated this week. Women fought for and won the right to vote 120 years ago and we owe it to them to use it!<br><strong>*</strong><br>Recently I met with our Manurewa-Papakura councillors Calum Penrose and Sir John Walker,  Bruce Pulman Park project manager Marie Stechman and Trustee Bruce Pulman. We discussed the excellent work continuing between AUT University and the Bruce Pulman Park Trust that will provide a campus in Papakura focused on sport and recreation. Once this goes ahead it will be a fantastic facility available not only to AUT University students but also the wider community. It is well placed to complement the work in sport and community the Bruce Pulman Park Trust has undertaken over many years.</p>

<p>I always enjoy my visits to early childhood centres when I’m back in the electorate.  This month I joined the team at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nznationalparty/9828973194/">First Steps Daycare</a> to mark the launch of their <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nznationalparty/9828994575/in/photostream/">JUMP JAM  programme</a>, promoting fitness. It’s great to see healthy habits encouraged and I know future First Steps children will benefit from this programme too.</p>
<p>It was fantastic to present <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nznationalparty/9827716654/">Papakura West Kindergarten</a> with a cheque from the New Zealand Glass Environment Fund, which supports schools for environmental projects. Papakura West Kindergarten applied for the grant to fund a butterfly house and extend planting in their outdoor space. I wish them all this best with this project.</p>
