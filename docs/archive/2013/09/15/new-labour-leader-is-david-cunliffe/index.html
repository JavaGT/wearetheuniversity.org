<p><strong>ENDS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Labour Party Leadership Election</strong><br><strong>Results</strong><br>15 September 2013<br><strong>HOW THE VOTING SYSTEM WORKS</strong><br>The system which we have adopted is <strong>single round preferential voting system</strong>. The winner will need to gain the support of a simple majority of the entire Electoral College. That will require all voters to return individual ballot papers detailing the preference votes cast for each candidate. The first preference votes cast for each candidate will then be aggregated nationally, <strong>appropriately weighted according to the strength of vote attached to each voter</strong>, across all three sections of the Electoral College. If no candidate gets a simple majority of the Electoral College votes in the first round, the Electoral College result will be recalculated, eliminating the candidate with the lowest percentage of Electoral College and redistributing those votes according to expressed preferences until one candidate exceeds the 52% threshold.</p>
