<p><strong>French flair proves Supreme winner</strong></p>
<p>Thomas Dietz and Etienne Moly launched their products on Bastille Day 2012, aiming to capture the essence of great French food in 100 per cent natural, preservative-free New Zealand-made products.</p>
<p>Tonight their company, TOMeTTE, was declared the winner of the Supreme Award at the 2013 New Zealand Food Awards.</p>
<p>The awards judges said TOMeTTE took traditional family recipes and turned them into tasty convenience meals without any deterioration in quality. They had to learn to make ready-to-eat meals that reheated well and also manage the food’s short shelf life.</p>
<p>The Auckland company, which also won the Convenience and Meal Solutions Award and the Processing Technology Award, was not the only French-influenced company to take home an award. Last year’s Supreme Award winner, Paneton Bakery, won the Bakery Award, beating out previous winner Andre’s Kitchen.</p>
<p>The annual awards, hosted by Massey University, are the premier competition for New Zealand food producers. University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey congratulated TOMeTTE and all the award winners at the event.</p>
<p>“Winning the New Zealand Food Awards is the pinnacle of achievement for any food producer – and TOMeTTE’s success shows that great flavour and strong technical know-how can create a world-class product from beautiful New Zealand food. All the award winners tonight should be very proud that their products and processes have withstood scrutiny by the experienced and expert judging panel, and were shown to be innovative leaders in their categories.”</p>

<p>The newest category – Healthier Choice – was won by newcomers Blue River Dairy with its Sheep Milk Powder. Described by the judges as “very New Zealand” the milk powder is an alternative option for those allergic to cow’s milk.</p>
<p>The battle of the beverages was won by Christchurch-based Aroha Drinks, while Pure Delish took out the Cereals and Breads Award. Fonterra’s boutique Kapiti Passionfruit and Yoghurt ice cream won the Confectionery and Snacks Award. The New Zealand Herald BITE Gourmet Award was won by Culleys, with their Green Chile Hot Sauce.</p>
<p>Inghams Waitoa Free Range Butterfly Chicken won the AsureQuality Food Safety Award, and MMC Tradelink’s exciting new Water Buddies, with glow-in-the-dark effects won the Flavour Packaging Design Award.</p>
<p>The KPMG Export Award was hotly contested, with previous award winners Alpine Origin Merino and Mt Cook Alpine Salmon pitted against newcomers The Collective, which won the award. The judges said The Collective’s approach in the establishment of channels to international markets was impressive, alongside its appetite to innovate in packaging and new consumer groups.</p>
<p>The Rabobank Business Innovation Award went to Christchurch-based A. Verkerk Limited, who impressed the judges with their focus on developing new products and their innovative approach to the environment and sustainability, with investment in new energy technology.</p>
<p>The Countdown Grocer’s Choice Award went to The Collective, with judges saying their entry showed originality in the choice of flavours, packaging and product targeted at kids. The Massey University Research and Development Award was won by Hubbards Foods Amazing Muesli, with judges commenting on their customer-focused product development strategy to ensure the product delivered to customer expectations.</p>
<p>All winners will be able to display the NZ Food Awards quality mark on their winning products for the next year.</p>
<p>Later this year the finalists and winners will have the opportunity to attend business capability-building workshops run by KPMG and Rabobank, and retail and commercialisation sessions run by Countdown.</p>
