<p>Associate Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>30 September 2013           MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Minister’s decision-making on trial once again</strong></p>
<p>Education Minister Hekia Parata’s controversial decision to close and merge Christchurch schools goes on trial again today, with Phillipstown School seeking a judicial review of its proposed merger with Woolston, says Labour’s Associate Education spokesperson Megan Woods.</p>
<p>“Today’s hearing sends a clear signal to the Minister that the local community feels let down by her decision and demonstrates a Government running roughshod over the people of Canterbury.</p>
<p>“Good on the board for being determined enough to stand up for the safety and wellbeing of children attending their school.</p>
<p>“Board members have argued all along that the rationale for the merger was flawed, and I am with them all the way in their last ditch effort to challenge the Minister’s proposal.</p>
<p>“This isn’t the first time Hekia Parata’s decision-making has been before the courts; a resolution to close Salisbury School was successfully challenged earlier this year, with the court finding she had abrogated her responsibilities.</p>
<p>“The manner in which Mrs Parata has carried out the school closures and mergers in Christchurch is just a further example of her failure to engage with the community, and once again she is being forced to defend her decisions,” said Megan Woods.</p>
