<p><strong>UC mechanical engineering students win tertiary engineering design competition</strong></p>
<p><strong>September 30, 2013</strong></p>
<p>A University of Canterbury (UC) team of mechanical engineering students have won the annual Australasian tertiary engineering design competition in Sydney.</p>
<p>The team of four undergraduate engineers -  Matthew Purdy (captain), James Francis, Emma Sirett and Guus Jans - received more than $3000 for winning the final of the Warman competition.</p>
<p>A total of 16 teams took part including the University of Auckland and Auckland University of Technology.</p>
<p>The UC team was so impressive and convincing that it was not required to take part in the run-off final.</p>
<p>Senior lecturer Dr Don Clucas says the UC team won a trophy that means they may require extra baggage in returning to New Zealand. </p>
<p>``There was an exhaustive process of local competitions to find the best UC mechanical engineering team to send.  This is a spectacular achievement and should be recognised at least as well as any international sporting achievement,’’  Dr Clucas says.</p>
<p>For the engineering design competition the students had to design, build and compete with a device to achieve certain tasks.</p>
