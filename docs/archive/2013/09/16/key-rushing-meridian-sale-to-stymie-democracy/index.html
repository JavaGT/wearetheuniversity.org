<p><strong>Key rushing Meridian sale to stymie democracy</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister John Key is arrogantly rushing through the sale of Meridian Energy before New Zealanders can have their say in the coming asset sales referendum, Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman said today.</p>
<p>The Government announced today that it would sell shares in Meridian Energy on October 29. The Government is yet to announce a date for the citizens-initiated referendum, which must be held after the Keep Our Assets petition gathered over 327,000 valid signatures. The Government has spent at least $124 million on the asset sales so far and the net foregone profits from the Mighty River Power sale are costing $2.3 million a week. Mighty River Power shares are currently trading 13% below their listing price.</p>
<p>“John Key is arrogantly rushing the Meridian sale when he should be waiting for Kiwis to have their say in the asset sales referendum,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“There’s no excuse for Mr Key to push ahead with the sale of Meridian at the same time as he refuses to set a date for the asset sales referendum.</p>
<p>“The Mighty River Power sale was an expensive disaster and Meridian is shaping up to be even worse.”</p>
<p>Those who bought shares in Mighty River Power on the back of National’s $6.5 million taxpayer-funded ad campaign have lost an average of a thousand dollars each so far. The total cost to the Crown of the asset sales is at least $124 million and is rising every day.</p>

<p>“Kiwis won’t be tricked by another expensive ad campaign from Mr Key using public money,” Dr Norman said.</p>
<p>“After the Mighty River flop, people won’t have a bar of Meridian. Even the Government is only predicting ‘tens of thousands’ of retail investors in Meridian, compared to the 250,000 they wrongly predicted would buy Mighty River shares.</p>
<p>“A sensible, fiscally responsible government would listen to New Zealanders and abandon these costly asset sales.”</p>
