<p>24 September 2013</p>
<p>A Modern Letters Weekend</p>
<p>The achievements of Victoria University’s International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML) will be celebrated this weekend at a gathering which will bring together some of New Zealand’s leading contemporary writers.</p>
<p>“This weekend is about showcasing our outstanding graduates, celebrating a vibrant community and having a good time,” says Damien Wilkins, Director of the IIML.</p>
<p>As part of the celebration, the documentary 13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird, will screen at the Paramount Theatre on Saturday 28 September. It was made by documentary filmmaker Richard Riddiford and supported by Victoria University’s Research Office.</p>
<p>Filmed in 2012, it offers the first extended view inside the community of writers based around the IIML and Victoria University Press.</p>
<p>Featuring leading figures such as Bill Manhire, Fergus Barrowman, Elizabeth Knox and Ken Duncum, the film explores the teaching of creative writing and profiles some of the newer generation of writers, including Man Booker Prize shortlisted novelist Eleanor Catton, Pip Adam, Tina Makereti and Lawrence Patchett.</p>
<p>Mr Wilkins hopes the film explodes a few myths about the Wellington literary scene.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening, the IIML’s first-ever alumni reading event will take place at Circa Theatre.</p>
<p>“While we’ve always been active through our various public outreach programmes, we’ve never held an alumni event, so it’s a very special couple of days,” he says.</p>

<p>An exciting mix of poets, scriptwriters and fiction writers will take part, including Carl Shuker, Hinemoana Baker, Frankie Samuel, Kirsten McDougall, Gavin McGibbon, Gigi Fenster, Lawrence Patchett, Martha Hardy Ward, Ashleigh Young, Eli Kent, Rob Hack and Kerry Donovan-Brown.</p>
<p>The idea for the evening reading is that each year of the Masters in Creative Writing taught at the IIML is represented by one writer.</p>
