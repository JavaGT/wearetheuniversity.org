<p>Regional Development Fund Slashed And Squandered</p>
<p>A Government fund intended for regional specific projects to grow the economy has instead been used to fund the organisation Kiwi Expatriates Abroad (KEA), says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce said in response to written questions from New Zealand First that KEA had in the past two financial years received $900,000 funding from the Regional Development and Industry (RDI) Fund.</p>
<p>The RDI Fund itself was slashed by the Government from $3.9 million in 2011/12 to just $200,000 in the current financial year.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters says while KEA is a worthy organisation it should not qualify for grants through the RDI Fund.</p>
<p>“Cutting the RDI Fund to just $200,000 a year is a disgrace and yet more evidence that the Government is ignoring the very real plight of regional New Zealand.</p>
<p>“But to then give what little is left to an organisation focused on New Zealanders living abroad, instead of funding regional-based projects, is little short of criminal.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says over the past two years only three entities received RDI funding.</p>
<p>“Organics Aotearoa received $37,599, the West Coast Memorial Centre $3.5 million, and Canterbury Business Recovery $55,708.</p>
<p>“That is the extent of the Government’s regional economic stimulus from this fund.</p>
<p>“No wonder small town New Zealand is slowly shutting up shop and joining the exodus to Australia,” says Mr Peters.</p>
