<p><strong>Steven Joyce in denial over Education Ministry in crisis</strong></p>
<p>Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce is delusional over the dysfunctional leadership of the Education Ministry, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>Mr Joyce claims there are no problems in the Ministry and Education Minister Hekia Parata isn’t to blame for the golden handshake awarded to Education Secretary Lesley Longstone.</p>
<p>Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says if Minister Parata is blameless for the failed working relationship, then what really went wrong?</p>
<p>“Ms Longstone’s resignation has been a costly exercise for taxpayers, with Prime Minister John Key implying the $267,953 in severance pay is nothing in the scheme of things.</p>
<p>“Plenty of teachers could offer suggestions of where the money could be better spent on education.</p>
<p>“Mr Key and his Government are clearly out of touch, with the Prime Minister appearing to think that he is still working as a money trader with Merrill Lynch.”</p>
<p>Ms Martin says months after Ms Longstone left her role, nothing’s been done to improve a Ministry in crisis.</p>
<p>“Teachers still face on-going problems with the Novopay system while the Government fails to take decisive action to fix the bungled pay roll system.</p>
<p>“The Government’s relentless attack at the heart of education smacks of arrogance,” says Ms Martin.</p>
