<p><strong>Wednesday, 6 March 2013, 12:21 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>6 March 2013<br><strong>_____________________________________________________</strong><br><strong>Is it lack of rights or the pull of home that prompts Māori return migration to NZ?</strong></p>
<p>Victoria University researcher Paul Hamer would like to hear from Māori who’ve returned to New Zealand from Australia as he investigates what prompts people to move home.</p>
<p>Mr Hamer, an Adjunct Research Associate at Te Kawa a Māui/School of Māori Studies, has previously published several papers on Māori in Australia, including a major report for Te Puni Kōkiri in 2007.</p>
<p>He is now looking at why Māori choose to leave Australia and return to New Zealand, as well as the state of Māori rights in Australia as New Zealand citizens.</p>
<p>“You usually hear that Māori return to New Zealand for cultural and whanau reasons,” he says. “However, since the 2001 changes that heavily restricted New Zealanders’ access to government services, benefits and higher education in Australia, I am wondering whether these reasons are also playing a part.”</p>
<p>Mr Hamer is also conducting a survey that asks Māori still living in Australia how they have been affected by the 2001 changes. Each survey is anonymous and takes 10 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>If you are of Māori descent and have returned to New Zealand from Australia please fill out this survey: <a href="http://vuw.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV%5C_d6BuVKV9ssBNKDj">http://vuw.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV\_d6BuVKV9ssBNKDj</a></p>
