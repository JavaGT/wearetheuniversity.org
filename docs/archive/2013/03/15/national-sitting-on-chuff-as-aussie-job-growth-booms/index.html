<p>Grant<br>ROBERTSON<br>Employment spokesperson</p>
<p>15 March 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>National Sitting On Chuff As Aussie Job Growth Booms</strong></p>
<p>The news that Australia has seen record job growth in the past month should be a wake-up call for a National government asleep at the tiller on job creation, Labour’s Employment spokesperson Grant Robertson says.</p>
<p>“Figures just released show that in February Australia had the <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/jobs-data-extraordinary-result-ellis/story-fn3dxiwe-1226597363117">biggest increase in job growth</a> in a decade, with 71,000 jobs created and unemployment at 5.4% despite an increase in people participating in the workforce.</p>
<p>“The contrast could not be starker in New Zealand. Over the last year 30,000 jobs have been lost while unemployment is at 6.9%. And that that would be 8.4% if more than 30,000 people had not given up on finding work.</p>
<p>“The government has failed New Zealanders with its hands-off-the-wheel, leave-it-to-the-market approach.</p>
<p>“No wonder the Ernst and Young survey of more than 200 businesses released last week showed that 70% of businesses here rated the government’s record on job creation at average to very poor.</p>
<p>“This is a government whose only plan for the economy is to sell assets.</p>
<p>“What is needed is a hands-on approach where the government rolls up its sleeves and gets alongside businesses and workers to help create jobs.</p>
<p>“That is what Labour would do. We would pull the big levers - like changing monetary policy and giving Kiwi firms a fair go at government contracts - and the small levers, such as more support for businesses to take on apprenticeships and for small businesses to grow.”</p>
<p>“Unless this government gets off its chuff we will be waving goodbye to tens of thousands more New Zealanders as they head to Australia.”.</p>
