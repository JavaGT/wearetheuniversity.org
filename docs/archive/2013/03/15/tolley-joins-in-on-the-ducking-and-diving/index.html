<p>15 March 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  </p>
<p><strong>Tolley Joins In On The Ducking And Diving</strong></p>
<p>Police Minister Anne Tolley is the latest to join in on the ducking and diving trend sweeping through the National Cabinet, says Labour’s Law and Order spokesperson Kris Faafoi.</p>
<p>“In response to leaks that major cuts are in store for the Waikato policing region, Anne Tolley has taken to the new craze to hit the Government - blaming someone else.</p>
<p>“With Waikato towns facing the loss of dozens of jobs, Anne Tolley’s response is that it’s the responsibility of Police to make resourcing decisions. That is no defence when she is the Minister responsible for budget cuts which are forcing police to slash their front-line.</p>
<p>“Front line policing is under increasing pressure as our officers are asked to do much more with much less. The massive restructuring underway in Police is about slashing costs to meet budgets. Anne Tolley has put that pressure on Police.</p>
<p>“These cuts will affect services in the Waikato, but the restructuring is happening nationwide. I am aware of other areas in New Zealand where similar decisions are imminent.</p>
<p>“Our confidence in Police is extremely high, but our Government is putting that at risk. And when the hard questions are being asked of the Minister all we get is ducking and diving,” said Kris Faafoi.  </p>
