<p>DAVID SHEARER<br>FROM RECOVERY TO LEGACY</p>
<p><strong>Grassroots Innovations: An Example to Follow</strong></p>
<p>Just over a week ago I stood with many of you in Latimer Square to mark the two year anniversary.</p>
<p>We remembered that in the most difficult circumstances Cantabrians found the best in themselves.</p>
<p>In the midst of the destruction and tragedy, people came together. The community responded.</p>
<p>Our first responders, Cancern, Wecan, The Farmy Army, the Student Volunteer Army, Gap Filler, Greening the Rubble, Rebuild Christchurch, the Rangiora Earthquake Express, Adopt a Christchurch Family, the Ministry of Awesome… the list goes on … These are local innovators. They didn’t wait to be asked, they saw a need and acted.</p>
<p>They inspired us, offered us hope, and they still do.</p>
<p>They showed us the strength of communities and how much can be achieved at the grassroots.</p>
<p>They offer the example for the future.</p>
<p>Before I got into politics, I worked for 20 years in disaster recovery for the United Nations.</p>
<p>I headed relief operations in Sri Lanka, Lebanon, Iraq and others.</p>
<p>As you would expect, every operation, every place was different, but they shared many things in common.</p>
<p><strong>National: Recovery From the Beehive Down</strong></p>
<p>Emergencies always begin with a top-down command structure when emergency services and relief agencies arrive to help.</p>
<p>But over the following weeks and months, there needs to be a fundamental shift: to bottom-up leadership:</p>
<p>Democracy. Inclusiveness. Listening.</p>
<p>Advertisement - scroll to continue reading</p>
<p>Genuine engagement with people.</p>
<p>Partnership.</p>
<p>After a crisis, people need leaders who are supportive and walk alongside them.</p>
<p>When people are involved in the decision-making, they become stronger as individuals and communities.</p>
<p>The act of empowerment, after a disempowering event, speeds recovery.</p>
<p>My years in the field taught me – and this is reinforced by experts across the globe – that a topdown recovery is the opposite to best practice.</p>
<p>Yet that’s what we have here in Christchurch.</p>
<p>It has resulted in an ever-growing government department accountable only to Wellington.</p>
<p>Far too often meetings are called in Wellington and decisions are handed down from there too.</p>
<p>Every time I’m in Christchurch the message gets stronger: “We’re not being listened to.&quot;</p>
<p>“We’ve been steamrolled.&quot;</p>
<p>“There’s no collaboration.&quot;</p>
<p>“Decisions are made without us.&quot;</p>
<p>“There seems to be another agenda.&quot;</p>
<p>“We’re ignored.&quot;</p>
<p>This is not fair, it’s not right, it’s not the kiwi way.</p>
<p>Hekia Parata’s plan to close and merge schools is the prime example.</p>
<p>After the endless disruption of the earthquakes, schools have become a refuge, a place of healing for kids.</p>
<p>When I headed disaster and relief operations re-opening schools was a priority that followed immediately after water, food, shelter and sanitation.</p>
<p>Why? Because getting kids back to familiar routines and playing with their friends worked better than thousands of hours of trauma counselling.</p>
<p>In disasters, schools are often a place – sometimes the only place – where kids can feel safe, more so than their own home.</p>
<p>And nowhere is that felt more than in Christchurch.</p>
<p>I recall a mother at a meeting at Ouruhia School I attended saying:</p>
<p>“I have a child at this school, and when there’s an earthquake during school when I’m at work, I know she’s safe, both emotionally and physically.&quot;</p>
<p>Schools aren’t just learning institutions: they’re centres of our communities.</p>
<p>So the Government’s announcement last year to close 13 schools and merge 18 – many of which didn’t need to be closed, was wrong in so many ways.</p>
<p>It made me angry because the ones who were asked to bear the brunt of that decision were our kids.</p>
<p>And because it profoundly failed to understand communities or involve them in their future.</p>
<p>Of course Hekia Parata quickly responded with a ‘charm offensive’ that was, frankly just plain offensive.</p>
<p><strong>Labour: A Different Approach</strong></p>
<p>The National Government sees democracy as a barrier to its plans.</p>
<p>It is taking advantage of a tired, distracted and devastated city to push those plans through.</p>
<p>I believe the people of Christchurch are calling out for a style of leadership that is both inclusive and engaging.</p>
<p>One that is also respectful of the diversity of views and opinions that Cantabrians have never been afraid to express.</p>
<p>At the end of last year we delivered a questionnaire to every household in Christchurch – 130,000 went out – asking you how you thought the recovery was going.</p>
<p>Nearly 90 per cent of the people that responded wanted more consultation from the Government.</p>
<p>Their message is clear: You can’t rebuild Canterbury from the top floor of the Beehive.</p>
<p>As Prime Minister I will approach decision-making differently.</p>
<p>It’s an approach that I know from my own experience delivers results.</p>
<p>The reality is that the recovery will take years, a generation.</p>
<p>That’s why I have committed Labour to a bi-partisan or perhaps, under MMP, a multi-partisan, approach to the recovery.</p>
<p>And in taking office in 2014 I will extend an offer to the current National ministers and all local MPs –to participate in the Christchurch recovery in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>But it’s also our job to hold the government to account – to bring about the best outcome.</p>
<p>And that means understanding the hopes and fears of people here.</p>
<p>We have relied heavily on our MPs – and we are truly fortunate to have dedicated great people: Lianne, Ruth, Clayton, Megan and Rino.</p>
<p>All have been touched by the quakes. Their story is the story of so many others.</p>
<p>I want to make sure that, in Government, we are in touch with the reality you face before we make decisions – not after.</p>
<p>That’s why, today, I’m committing to holding public meetings around the region every six weeks.</p>
<p>Not to talk at people. But as an opportunity to engage with Cantabrians, to work out how we can best represent your concerns, take your ideas forward.</p>
<p>Senior members of my caucus will also be here regularly.</p>
<p>From health, housing, and education to transport, employment and tertiary education, all of these portfolios are critical to Canterbury.</p>
<p>Our Canterbury MPs need more support from their colleagues.</p>
<p>Through this approach I see the chance not just for a rebuild, but for a revitalized economy.</p>
<p>An economy bigger than one stadium. A stadium is not a strategy for the future.</p>
<p>My sights for Canterbury are higher than the Government’s.</p>
<p>I see the opportunity to build a legacy that outlasts the recovery.</p>
<p>I believe the Canterbury rebuild could be the model for what New Zealand should be: a high value, job rich, diversified economy.</p>
<p>We know we cannot put ever more cows on grass.</p>
<p>Last year manufacturing’s contribution to our economy was three times larger than tourism. And double that of agriculture, forestry and fishing.</p>
<p>We also know that countries like Denmark – a country with an agriculture industry of a similar size to ours – have a higher standard of living because their manufacturing sector is bigger.</p>
<p>Danish kids go on to work in Denmark, because their industries generate high value jobs.</p>
<p>That’s the sort of future I want for Canterbury.</p>
<p>That’s why I’m committed to a plan that looks beyond the rebuild.</p>
<p>One that is focussed on the opportunities that will both speed the recovery and sustain Canterbury’s long-term future.</p>
<p><strong>A Legacy that Outlasts the Recovery</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Manufacturing</em></strong></p>
<p>Opportunities like manufacturing. Canterbury is a centre of export manufacturing in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Each time I speak to the people at Tait Electronics, for example, I am reminded that every job created in manufacturing generates between two and five jobs outside.</p>
<p>The core business of Tait has led to opportunities in service and retail.</p>
<p>We need more companies like this in New Zealand.</p>
<p>But that requires the right policies to encourage them to grow.</p>
<p>Tom Thomson from Elastomer Products was at our manufacturing inquiry. He put it well when he said: “the problem here is … we have a three-year electoral cycle and a feeling that supporting your manufacturing base is somehow cheating”.</p>
<p>Supporting manufacturers and exporters is not cheating. It’s good economics.</p>
<p>My approach will be ‘hands-on’, leading a smart, active government that will grow innovative businesses and jobs.</p>
<p>I’ve made clear commitments to back our manufacturers.</p>
<p>Here are 5 immediate actions we will undertake in 2014: 1. We will change our monetary policy so job-creating businesses aren’t hamstrung by our exchange rate. The high and volatile dollar is costing us export opportunities – and therefore jobs.</p>
<p>2. We will expand KiwiSaver to grow our ability to invest in New Zealand businesses.</p>
<p>3. We will introduce a capital gains tax so the right incentives are there to drive investment into productive businesses – and out of the Auckland property market.</p>
<p>4. We will bring back R&amp;D tax credits to encourage companies to innovate.</p>
<p>5. We will put Kiwi companies first in line when it comes to the Government’s $30 billion worth of procurement spending.</p>
<p>These policies – and other ideas – are being further tested as part of the manufacturing inquiry that opposition parties are leading together.</p>
<p>I thank those of you who have contributed to the inquiry.</p>
<p>6<br>One of the things we’ve been hearing from manufacturers is the challenge they face in finding skilled workers.</p>
<p>That’s one of the reasons I think we should be looking at the untapped potential of our young people.</p>
<p><strong><em>Training and Employment</em></strong></p>
<p>I went to university in Canterbury.</p>
<p>It was the best year’s education of my life. It taught me to think critically. I thank the staff for that.</p>
<p>But it’s one example of how tough things are down here right now. The university is facing a $67 million deficit.</p>
<p>We can’t afford to let it fail. Its health will determine the success of Christchurch.</p>
<p>That’s why Labour is committed to a strong university at the heart of the city.</p>
<p>Our next generation needs the skills to do the jobs we’re asking of them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our graduates in the fields of science, engineering, and computer science are flatlining – whereas we have accountants and lawyers in abundance.</p>
<p>Nowhere in New Zealand is there a bigger opportunity than right here in Canterbury.</p>
<p>Half of the estimated 30,000 jobs generated by the rebuild will be filled by foreigners.</p>
<p>Two years ago we knew there would be rebuild and we would need skills.</p>
<p>Why didn’t the government move with war-time urgency to up-skill some of the 90,000 young people not in work or education.</p>
<p>Instead it said there was no need to plan – the market will take care of it, hands-off is best.</p>
<p>Here are two simple ideas to help young New Zealanders into the workforce.</p>
<p>1. Pay employers the equivalent of the dole when they take on an unemployed young person as a new apprentice for the first year.</p>
<p>2. Institute a One-in-a-Million programme.</p>
<p>The quid-pro-quo for Kiwi companies being at the front of the queue for significant Government contracts is that they take on an apprentice or trainee for every $1 million of tax payer dollars they receive on a multi-year contract.</p>
<p>One trained Kiwi for every one million dollars spent on labour. Simple.</p>
<p>Rebuilding Canterbury offers the opportunity to help young New Zealanders build a career.</p>
<p>And in return we get the next generation of tradespeople.</p>
<p>It’s not that hard really. But it means rolling up your sleeves and getting hands on. Not leaving it to the market.</p>
<p><strong><em>Housing</em></strong></p>
<p>Housing is another area in desperate need of action.</p>
<p>Whether because of damage, or workers pouring into Canterbury, people are struggling to find affordable houses to buy or rent.</p>
<p>The housing market is failing Cantabrians.</p>
<p>Prices have soared.</p>
<p>Affordable housing is urgently needed.</p>
<p>Our KiwiBuild policy will put 100,000 families into their first home over 10 years.</p>
<p>For those first home buyers who are saving hard, the prospect of warm, dry, affordable homes is generating huge excitement.</p>
<p>The government issues bonds to fund the first build and as each new house is sold, the money is used to build the next.</p>
<p>We pay the bond holders back at the end with the final sale. Simple.</p>
<p>It’s what can be done with a government prepared to be hands on.</p>
<p>Construction companies we have contacted, tell us that building in bulk will give economies of scale to bring down prices substantially.</p>
<p>That in turn will take pressure off the rental market.</p>
<p>Too many Cantabrians have been forced to put their lives on hold while they search for a new home.</p>
<p>You’ve been living with this for two and half years now. You deserve the chance to move on.</p>
<p><strong><em>Canterbury reclaiming the recovery</em></strong></p>
<p>You deserve a voice in the future of your region.</p>
<p>Above all, the people of Canterbury must come first and be a real part of the recovery.</p>
<p>Under CERA, the functions of councils have been engulfed. Elections have been cancelled and appointees installed.</p>
<p>You have lost the ability to have a say in your own future.</p>
<p>My commitment is to give Canterbury its voice back.</p>
<p>1. We will commit to the establishment of a CERA board.</p>
<p>This will give an opportunity for local, independent and respected voices to be heard on the rebuild.</p>
<p>Central government should provide oversight and intervene only when necessary.</p>
<p>That’s why I want to see CERA collaborate and partner with the three local authorities in a way that works for each of them.</p>
<p>2. We will call fresh elections for ECan in 2015.</p>
<p>3. We’ll establish an independent insurance commissioner for those Cantabrians stuck in a battle with their insurance company.</p>
<p>Cantabrians need someone standing in their corner.</p>
<p>Most can’t afford the money it costs to go toe to toe with an insurance company.</p>
<p>They need an independent voice, with the power to stand up for the little guy.</p>
<p>We’ll also ask the commissioner to initiate a review of our entire insurance industry.</p>
<p>People need to be confident that they know what they’re getting when they’re buying insurance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for too many Cantabrians that hasn’t been the case.</p>
<p>4. Finally, we will also commit to funding some of the test cases that Canterbury residents have been forced to take themselves.</p>
<p>It’s wrong that tired exhausted Cantabrians are being left alone to battle insurance giants to get access to the compensation that is rightfully theirs.</p>
<p>This year we’ll look at ways to rebuild the city while preserving as much of its heritage as possible.</p>
<p>Let’s be prudent with what we decide to demolish today. Let’s pause if we think it might be saved for another day.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Recovery means salvaging what matters, rebuilding communities and revitalizing Canterbury’s economy.</p>
<p>It means fresh thinking – shifting to a diversified high value economy.</p>
<p>An economy powered by industries such as high-tech manufacturing that builds on the hightech expertise of Tait, Hamilton Jet and other outstanding examples.</p>
<p>Christchurch can lead the way for the rest of the country.</p>
<p>It means rethinking our urban environment – putting a Kiwi stamp on the rebuild – sustainable materials, energy efficient – or energy generating, new technologies.</p>
<p>It can mean zero energy buildings, efficient public transport, and green spaces.</p>
<p>Christchurch has the potential to be one of the most inspiring urban design projects in the world.</p>
<p>And it can be an equitable city. Where planning ensures that everyone gets a share of the rewards – from decent housing, to skills training, and to jobs.</p>
<p>My great fear is that people are not being involved as they should be.</p>
<p>And without them, we will not think creatively enough, nor aim high enough.</p>
<p>Instead decisions will be top down, made by those who strive for the ordinary, the status quo.</p>
<p>Canterbury can lead the way for the 21st century.</p>
<p>But we need to be bold.</p>
<p>We need decisions from the grassroots up, not the Beehive down.</p>
<p>The legacy of Christchurch’s recovery should be equal to the courage of those who have endured and a tribute to those who were lost.</p>
<p>That’s a very high bar. But it is what we should expect if we are to leave this region with the legacy it deserves.</p>
