<p>Phil<br>GOFF<br>Defence Spokesperson</p>
<p>04 March 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  </p>
<p><strong>Inadequate training reckless and wrong</strong></p>
<p>The Government was reckless and wrong to put Rugby World Cup requirements ahead of proper pre-deployment training for Kiwi soldiers bound for Afghanistan, says Phil Goff, Labour’s Defence spokesperson.</p>
<p>“The Minister of Defence and the Government stand condemned by the fact that the Warrant Officer in charge of the training was not confident CRIB 19 was adequately prepared before leaving for Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“The first responsibility of any Government sending troops into a war zone is to do everything it can to ensure their safety. Their preparation and training are critical.</p>
<p>“By cutting pre-deployment training, apparently because of Rugby World Cup commitments, the Government left the CRIB19 training officer feeling he had no choice but to deploy the force, despite his belief that it was not adequately prepared.</p>
<p>“The Minister of Defence should never have allowed this to happen. Clearly the Defence Force was unable simultaneously to carry out its duties for the Rugby World Cup and properly prepare its people for Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“This is further evidence that the Government’s cut in Defence Force personnel by more than a thousand in 2011/2012 has reduced the Defence Force’s capability to properly carry out its roles.</p>
<p>“The problem for CRIB 19 was made worse by being required to stay in Afghanistan for an extra two months. The Court of Inquiry heard that the extension without any leave left troops exhausted at the end of the tour.</p>
<p>“A combination of cuts in training, including the component on stress management and identification, and longer deployment will have significantly increased the risk to our troops.</p>
<p>“The National Government has a lot of explaining to do,” Phil Goff says.</p>
