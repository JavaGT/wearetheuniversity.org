<p><strong>More Than 150 Cafés, Restaurants And Bars Have Opened In Christchurch Since Christmas</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>March 4, 2013</strong></p>
<p>More than 150 cafes, restaurants and bars have opened in Christchurch since Christmas, a University of Canterbury (UC) senior marketing lecturer said today.</p>
<p>A total of 692 bars, cafes and restaurants have now reopened in Christchurch following the 2011 earthquakes, UC’s Dr Sussie Morrish said.</p>
<p>``Although many outlets have yet to reopen, the space is slowly being filled by new cafes or bars coming onto the scene since the earthquakes such as the Spice Paragon at Bush Inn and The Monday Room restaurant and bar on Moorhouse Avenue,’’ Dr Morrish said.</p>
<p>``Many restaurants have also relocated to other parts of the city. Some have also been renamed. Interestingly, Merivale is becoming an entertainment hub judging by the popularity of the restaurants, bars and cafes in the area.</p>
<p>``Overall, the outlook is looking good as the rebuild gathers pace. The central business district (CBD) will become vibrant again as more premises reopen. However, the positive thing is that entrepreneurial businesses are seizing the opportunity to get themselves established and repositioning their brands as the supply struggles to keep up with the demand.</p>
<p>``However they should not be complacent. Customers can be quite vocal with any dissatisfaction and word-of-mouth soon spreads. Online comments have also become a common medium for venting frustration so it is best to manage these expectations.</p>

<p>Christchurch&#39;s Central City Business Association manager Paul Lonsdale said the UC research project was providing very helpful information.</p>
<p>``I expect that the reduction of hospitality outlets is the main reason the ones currently in operation being so busy. Valentino&#39;s has reopened on St Asaph Street, Dux Dine has opened on Riccarton Road and The Twisted Hop on Ferry Road in Woolston. Sala Sala is due to open on Papanui Road.</p>
<p>``There are a huge number of new cafes and restaurants opening now on a weekly basis with Duo on Rolleston Ave and Venitu (formerly Portifinos) on Colombo Street (north) just opened.</p>
<p>``I believe the UC and, in particular, Dr Morrish&#39;s work is hugely important as research highlights the demand versus need and it will be getting that balance right to ensure that part of the industry is able to deliver a sustainable offer for Christchurch,’’ Lonsdale said today.</p>
