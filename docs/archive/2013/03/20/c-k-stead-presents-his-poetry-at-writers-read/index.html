<p>One of New Zealand’s best-known authors, C.K. Stead, is guest speaker at the first event in Massey University’s 2013 Writers Read series, at Albany on March 27.</p>

<p>Professor Stead will be reading from and discussing his most recent work: his new book of poems <em>The Yellow Buoy: Poems 2007 - 2012</em>, published last month, and the novel <em>Risk</em>, which was published in late 2012.</p>
<p>He has published numerous books of poetry, essays and literary criticism, as well as 12 novels and two books of short stories. His <em>Collected Poems 1951-2006</em>, published by Auckland University Press, appeared in 2008. A memoir of his early life, <em>South West of Eden</em>, appeared in 2009.</p>
<p>Professor Stead’s lecture will be held in the Round Room of the Atrium Building on Wednesday March 27, starting at 12 noon. It is free to anyone wishing to attend.</p>
