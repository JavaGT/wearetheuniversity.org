<p><strong>GE fungus leak breaks regulations</strong></p>
<p>The unapproved release of a genetically engineered fungus is massive wake up call to our environmental regulators, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has confirmed today that a genetically engineered (GE) fungus has been found outside of its approved containment facilities at Lincoln University’s campus.</p>
<p>“It’s absolutely not acceptable that almost two weeks after this breach the Ministry still doesn’t know how it occurred,” said Green Party genetic engineering spokesperson Steffan Browning.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders are constantly reassured that GE organisms are contained securely when used in research, but here we have another example of those restrictions not working.</p>
<p>“We deserve answers now about what has gone wrong here, and how the Ministry are going to assure it doesn’t happen again.</p>
<p>The Ministry confirmed that wild strains of this fungus are widely spread in the environment.</p>
<p>“There are questions to be asked about any risk of cross contamination into wild species.</p>
<p>&quot;The question is, how far has this unacceptable GE fungus spread? Either by insects, soil or water from the unapproved facility,” said Mr Browning.</p>
<p>Lincoln University and Crown Research Agencies have previously been implicated or found responsible for other GE experiment breaches, with some trials closed down.</p>
<p>“Our clean, green brand that adds value to our agricultural exports, depends on our GE free status,” said Mr Browning.</p>
