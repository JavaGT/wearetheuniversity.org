<p><strong>Waikato student’s film about loneliness makes festival final</strong></p>
<p>A Waikato student’s short film about sadness and loneliness felt by youth will be screened at the upcoming Uni Shorts International Short Film Festival.</p>
<p>Former University of Waikato student and aspiring director Miguel Efondo is one of five finalists in the experimental/non-narrative category.</p>
<p>His film Triste follows one character who is sitting alone in a room. Visibly distressed, the character is antagonised by shadow-puppets to an ever increasing wall of white noise before hiding behind a smiling mask.</p>
<p>“I’m originally from the Philippines, my family moved to New Zealand in 2008. The film is about how you cannot conceal sadness, even by wearing a smiling mask.</p>
<p>“Its inspiration was drawn on my own experiences. When I first came here I didn’t know anyone and I was sad. I missed my friends back home and I tried to reach out to other people here but I wasn’t successful. Maybe it was because of the culture difference, or maybe it was because I was just so shy. You kind of exist with a ‘happiness mask’ on and project happiness when really you’re anything but.”</p>
<p>Miguel filmed Triste over one night to meet a video production assignment. It was an alternative idea when his first film was supposed to be filmed outside but it rained the whole week. A second night was spent editing and mastering the film.</p>
<p>“I want to become involved in the film industry in New Zealand and thought if I signed up for as many film festivals as possible, it would help get my name out there.”</p>

<p>As well as being shown at Uni Shorts, Triste will also be shown at the Wellington Underground Film Festival this weekend, 21 - 23 March.</p>
<p>Miguel finished his Bachelor of Media and Creative Technologies majoring in Screen and Media and Design Media last year and is now at Unitec in Auckland studying Script Writing.</p>
<p>The Uni Shorts 2013 festival will be held on 13-14 April at Auckland’s Unitec Institute of Technology. Thirty finalists were chosen from nearly 200 short film entries that were submitted from film schools and universities around the world.</p>
