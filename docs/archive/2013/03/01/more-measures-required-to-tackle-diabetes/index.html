<p><strong>More Measures Required To Tackle Diabetes</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First says our fast-food mentality and over-consumption of sugary drinks must be tackled if we are to reverse an impending diabetes epidemic.</p>
<p>Health spokesperson Barbara Stewart says a University of Otago study which found 19 per cent of Kiwis over the age of 15 had a glucose metabolism disorder which often leads to diabetes made for grim reading.</p>
<p>“The terrible statistics in the report are a clear warning that urgent action must be taken to curb the impending explosion in the rate of diabetes.</p>
<p>“We need to change our take-away mentality, our obsession with sugary drinks, and get tough on companies loading fat and sugar into food and drink products.”</p>
<p>Mrs Stewart says more preventative diabetes measures are also urgently required.</p>
<p>“Green Prescriptions are a good start but are not the full answer.</p>
<p>“There needs to be a full national strategy to tackle our burgeoning obesity and diabetes epidemics, including a national diabetes screening programme.</p>
<p>“The cost of establishing coordinated strategies and screening programmes would quickly be recouped through the massive health savings it would generate,” says Mrs Stewart.</p>
