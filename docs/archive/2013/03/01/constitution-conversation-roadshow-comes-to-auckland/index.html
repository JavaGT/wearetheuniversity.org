<p>NZUSA release; Friday 1st March</p>
<p>Constitution Conversation Roadshow Comes to University of Auckland</p>
<p>The Auckland University Students&#39; Association (AUSA) will be hosting a discussion about the state of New Zealand&#39;s Constitution at a &#39;Big Questions&#39; day being held on the campus this Monday 4th March.</p>
<p>The afternoon of the &#39;Big Questions&#39; day - a joint initiative between AUSA and NZUSA (the NZ Union of Students&#39; Associations) - will focus on issues being explored by the Constitutional Advisory Panel and their promotional campaign called the &#39;Constitution Conversation&#39;.</p>
<p>A forum of university students will be led by panel members Dr Ranginui Walker and Bernice Mene, along with AUSA President Dan Haines and NZUSA president Pete Hodkinson. Issues that will be focused on include the Bill of Rights, Treaty of Waitangi, Maori representation and electoral matters such as whether a three year term of Parliament is long enough.</p>
<p>The morning of the &#39;Big Questions&#39; day will focus on policies being reviewed by the Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement Income, with discussion to be facilitated by Commission research manager Malcolm Menzies. The major issue being debated is the fairness of the expectation that the future working-age population - including current students for whom retirement income is an abstract concept - will be able to shoulder the burden of supporting an ageing population.</p>
<p>The day is part of a roadshow that NZUSA President Pete Hodkinson commenced this week (25 Feb), with similar events already held at Otago University and Lincoln University.</p>
<p>From Auckland he will travel on to Waiariki Institute of Technology Students&#39; Association in Rotorua on Wednesday, and Victoria University of Wellington Students&#39; Association on Friday. Constitutional Advisory Panel members who will take part in these events are Professor Linda Huiwai Smith (Rotorua) and Deborah Coddington (Wellington).</p>
