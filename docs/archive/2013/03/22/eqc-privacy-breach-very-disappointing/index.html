<p>Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson<br>22 March 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>EQC privacy breach very disappointing</strong></p>
<p>The breach of 9700 people’s privacy by the Earthquake Commission is very disappointing, especially given the amount of stress Cantabrians are under, Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Lianne Dalziel said.</p>
<p>“On top of everything Cantabrians have faced in the past two and a half years, this is more stress for them to cope with. It’s the last thing they needed. The EQC must get in contact with those affected as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“I give EQC credit for fronting up to their mistake. But there is a culture of privacy breaches happening in government, following the ACC, MSD and IRD breaches. Thousands of people have had their privacy breached in the past year.</p>
<p>“It seems extremely lax to send such a vast amount of private information by email. Everything must be done to prevent this happening again.”</p>
