<p><strong>Slick idea wins UC business competition</strong></p>
<p><strong>March 21, 2013</strong></p>
<p>University of Canterbury (UC) student Troy Scott has won a competition that encourages UC students to share their business ideas.</p>
<p>The Napkin challenge, which is part of the entre programme to educate students in business development, requires students to submit their business ideas on a small paper napkin.</p>
<p>Scott’s idea was a snakeskin-type product, like a slick, to put over mountain bike tyres to save cyclists buying different tyres, providing versatility and cost effectiveness.</p>
<p>The ``Funniest Idea Award’’ went to student Lachie Watson for his a moving basketball hoop target in urinals. He said it was a great way to meet new people in a competitive environment.</p>
<p>``Most Innovative’’ went to a fast food tray activated rubbish bin door opener to avoid the unhygienic alternative of using hands. This idea was submitted by Sean Gardner.</p>
<p>``Most Beneficial to Students’’ category was won by Brad Darling for a phone app that uses a communication technique to open doors at UC through UC identity cards.</p>
<p>``Most Plausible’’ went to Nicole Evans for sewing the top bed sheet to the bottom bed sheet to save time during bed making.</p>
<p>The Napkin Challenge is the first of many competitions in the annual entre programme.</p>
<p>Later this year students will compete for $75,000 worth of prizes in the annual $75K Challenge.</p>
