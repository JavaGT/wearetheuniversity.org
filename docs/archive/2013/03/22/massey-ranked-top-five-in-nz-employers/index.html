<p><strong>Massey Ranked Top Five in NZ Employers</strong></p>
<p>Massey University has been ranked number five of New Zealand most attractive employer brands in the annual Ranstad Awards, an international survey conducted across 14 countries. It was also the education sector winner.</p>
<p>The New Zealand awards were presented in Auckland last night, with Air New Zealand topping the list, followed by New Zealand Customs Service, the Department of Conservation and Television New Zealand. Massey was the highest ranked educational institute, ahead of AUT University (10th), Victoria University of Wellington (12th), and the University of Auckland (13th).</p>
<p>Research company ICMA International conducts the survey, asking 160,000 respondents to rate employers by 17 factors including the financial health of the organisation, its management and leadership, job security, career progression opportunities, good learning and development opportunities, work-life balance, environmental and social awareness, salaries and benefits, workplace culture and whether it offers quality products and services.</p>
<p>Massey Assistant Vice-Chancellor (People and Organisational Development) Alan Davis received the award on the University&#39;s behalf.</p>
