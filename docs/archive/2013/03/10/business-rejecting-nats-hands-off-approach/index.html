<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Business rejecting Nats hands-off approach</strong><br> <br>National’s hands-off approach to the economy is not only costing thousands of jobs, it’s also losing them the support of business, says Labour’s Employment spokesperson Grant Robertson.<br> <br>“Almost 70 per cent of businesses surveyed by  Ernst &amp;Young say the Government’s approach to job creation is average or poor. That’s a shocking indictment on a government that claims it’s the friend of business.<br> <br>“The same survey showed that 70 per cent of the business community rate the Government’s ability to develop a business growth agenda as poor. Perhaps that’s because Steven Joyce took a year to explain his Business Growth Agenda and it was nothing more than a bunch of glossy re-announcements.<br> <br>“We know the public are losing faith in John Key’s hands-off approach. But now it’s clear business is concerned as well.<br> <br>“And they are right to be worried, a net 30,000 jobs have been lost over the last year. The economy is stagnating, power prices are increasing and the overvalued dollar is crippling exporters and manufacturers. The Government needs to change tack.<br> <br>“Businesses want a Government that will work alongside them and help them get the opportunities they need to grow and create jobs. National has clearly failed to do this.<br> <br>“Labour will take a more hands-on approach and tackle the big issues. We will focus on improving the skills in our workforce such as using our apprenticeships for the dole scheme and training people who lose their jobs. Our KiwiBuild policy to build 100,000 new homes will create significant growth opportunities.<br> <br>“We will change the Reserve Bank’s tunnel-vision mandate of inflation-targeting and give wider scope to take into account jobs and the exchange rate. And we are determined to create a clean, smart and diversified economy that creates opportunities for everyone,” says Grant Robertson.<br> <br>ENDS</p>
