<p><strong>Pacific Geopolitics Under Spotlight At Otago Foreign Policy School</strong></p>
<p>This year’s University of Otago Foreign Policy School will bring together an impressive line-up of national and international speakers to explore key geopolitical issues facing the Pacific.</p>
<p>The speaker line-up features leading scholars along with representatives from diplomatic, development and political spheres, including former Fijian Prime Minister Major-General Sitiveni Rabuka and former New Zealand Ambassador Michael Powles.</p>
<p>The Otago Foreign Policy School, which is in its 48th year, gathers academics, students, policymakers, diplomats and members of the public to discuss and debate pressing issues in international affairs. It is being held at St Margaret’s College on the University’s Dunedin campus from Friday 28 June until Sunday 30 June.</p>
<p>Titled “Pacific Geopolitics in the 21st Century”, the latest School will focus on themes including the United States and China’s growing engagement in the Pacific, the uncertain prospects for Fiji’s return to democracy, Pacific nations’ efforts to reach the Millennium Development Goals, and the extent to which countries can work together at a regional and sub-regional level to address issues central to the above areas.</p>
<p>School Co-Director Dr Iati Iati says he anticipates that given the issues being addressed, and who the presenters are, this will be one of the marquee events in New Zealand for Pacific geopolitics for quite some time.</p>

<p><strong>About the Foreign Policy School</strong></p>
<p>Since its inception in 1966, the University of Otago Foreign Policy School has developed into one of the premiere events in New Zealand&#39;s international calendar. Originally started as a workshop on foreign affairs issues, the School soon attracted the attention of New Zealand&#39;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade which recognised its value as a weekend retreat for officials.<br>Representatives from other government bodies such as the Prime Minister&#39;s office and the Ministry of Defence, as well as academics, journalists, diplomats, members of the private sector and NGOs, and interested members of the public also participate regularly.</p>
