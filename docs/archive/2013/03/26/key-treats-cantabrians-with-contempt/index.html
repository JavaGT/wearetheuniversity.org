<p><strong>Tuesday, 26 March 2013, 3:26 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>David<br>SHEARER<br>Labour Leader<br>26 March 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  </p>
<p><strong>Key Treats Cantabrians With Contempt</strong></p>
<p>John Key has today arrogantly dismissed the concerns of 83,000 Canterbury households whose private information was breached by playing the fool and refusing to take action to prevent it happening again, says Labour Leader David Shearer.</p>
<p>“Under John Key’s watch, there have been serious breaches of New Zealanders’ private information at the Ministry of Social Development, ACC, IRD, Work and Income, Novopay, Corrections and now EQC.</p>
<p>“This isn’t just a simple case of human error. It’s clear evidence of a serious and widespread problem with the security of our Government information systems. Yet this Prime Minister’s response is to simply laugh, shrug his shoulders and say ‘oh well, it’s just like putting the wrong address on an envelope’.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders expect their privacy to be taken seriously and protected. It’s astonishing that John Key can be so cavalier in the face of a breach of this magnitude. He has so far refused to give any undertaking that he will deal with the concerns raised by this incident.</p>
<p>“John Key and his ministers would rather point the finger than pull their finger out and ensure that there are adequate software protections in place to avoid the unauthorised release of New Zealanders’ confidential information,” said David Shearer.</p>
