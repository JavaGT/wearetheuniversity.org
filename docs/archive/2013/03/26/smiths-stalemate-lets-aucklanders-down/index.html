<p>Phil<br>TWYFORD<br>Housing Spokesperson</p>
<p>26 March 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Smith’s stalemate lets Aucklanders down</strong></p>
<p>The stalemate between Nick Smith and the Auckland Council over the city’s Unitary Plan shows the Government’s housing policy is in disarray, says Labour’s Housing spokesperson Phil Twyford.</p>
<p>“The decision to set up a working party of government and council officials to <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/bernard-orsman/news/article.cfm?a_id=67&objectid=10873626">‘get on top’</a> of Auckland’s housing crisis is just another stalling tactic from a Minister with no new ideas and no plan.<br>“One minute Nick Smith is accusing Len Brown of killing the dreams of Aucklanders. The next he is saying he and Len are in the same paddock.<br>“This is a face-saving exercise for Nick Smith who has obviously been told to downplay his public brawling with the council.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder reports of the post-meeting press conference described awkwardness and confusion as the Mayor and Nick Smith tried to explain precisely what the ‘working party’ would be doing.</p>
<p>“Aucklanders will be disappointed. They now face six to nine weeks of political and bureaucratic chin-wagging on top of years of preparation and input into the Unitary Plan.</p>
<p>“The Government’s position of not giving legal effect to the Unitary Plan for three years was last night justified by Nick Smith as a way to ensure community engagement.</p>

<p>“The thousands of Aucklanders who submitted on the Unitary Plan won’t see it that way. This has everything to do with what the Government wants – and very little to do with what Aucklanders want.</p>
<p>“Nick Smith has talked a big game when it comes to addressing Auckland’s housing supply, but his prescription is policy-lite. Just weeks ago he promised to break the ‘stranglehold’ of land supply. Now he has <a href="http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/auckland/news/nbnat/1068020009-auck-s-housing-problems-could-affect-whole-country---nick-smith">admitted</a> that if Auckland&#39;s housing problems are allowed to get worse, they&#39;ll affect the whole country.</p>
<p>“One thing is for sure -- the Minister’s lack of leadership, vision and his inability to offer up any alternative solutions will see Auckland’s progress stalled, Phil Twyford said.</p>
