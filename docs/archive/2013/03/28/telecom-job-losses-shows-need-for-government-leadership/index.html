<p><strong>Telecom job losses shows need for government leadership</strong></p>
<p>The loss of around a thousand jobs at Telecom will be a hard blow for the families of these workers and highlights the need for a government strategy to boost the ICT sector, Green Party ICT spokesperson Gareth Hughes said today.</p>
<p>Telecom has announced that it will axe between 930 and 1230 jobs by the middle of this year.</p>
<p>“The loss of around a thousand highly-skilled, well-paid jobs at Telecom will be devastating for those workers and their families, as well as their communities – the Green Party’s thoughts are with them,” said Mr Hughes.</p>
<p>“How many of these skilled workers will leave for Australia in search of stable work and higher pay?</p>
<p>“We need to give skilled Kiwis a reason to stay in this country but there’s no strategy from the National Government to create and protect Kiwi jobs.</p>
<p>“The Greens have launched an ICT policy that will make the Internet faster and cheaper with a second international cable. We also think the Government should back New Zealand’s ICT industry by making government agencies consider the wider economic benefits to New Zealand of supporting the local ICT industry when making purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>“That will provide a huge boost to our ICT industry and create job opportunities for workers like those losing their jobs at Telecom.</p>
<p>“Where’s the innovative thinking from National? How much longer can they just shrug their shoulders and ignore the growing ally job of losses?,” said Mr Hughes.</p>
