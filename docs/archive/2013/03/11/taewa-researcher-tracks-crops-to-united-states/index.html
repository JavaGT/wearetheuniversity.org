<p><strong>Taewa researcher tracks crops to United States</strong></p>
<p>A Massey University researcher will travel to the United States later this year to better understand the history of taewa (Maori potato), kumara, and Indian corn.</p>
<p>Dr Nick Roskruge was awarded a Fulbright Travel Scholarship that will see him based at Cornell University in New York State for two months, beginning in April.</p>
<p>He will be based at Cornell’s International Institute for Food, Agriculture and Development.</p>
<p>“The idea is to do some presentations on my research to date,” he says. “But I will also do some more research on the origin and distribution of these three key crops.”</p>
<p>Part of Dr Roskruge’s work is science-based – looking at the genetics of the crops – but he also works with the communities of interest to hear oral histories that will help plot the crops’ dispersal.</p>
<p>Comparing production systems between communities and continents also provides insight to the knowledge systems around these crops.</p>
<p>Indian corn originates from Central America – Arizona and Mexico – while kumara comes from the northern tropical parts of South America and taewa originates further south in the Andean mountains and temperate Chile.</p>
<p>“I want to find out how these crops moved out from these origins,” he says. “This all happened before Spanish settlement there, so talking to indigenous groups is important.”</p>
<p>Dr Roskruge will travel across the United States to Washington to meet with the Makah Native Americans in Neah Bay, near the Canadian border.</p>

<p>“I have done some work with them in the past, as they have several ancient varieties of crop there that I hope to find out more about. They know a lot about the early movement of boats around the Pacific.”</p>
<p>He hopes to marry these two strands of research together into a book tracking the dispersal of the three crops through both scientific research and the stories told by indigenous people.</p>
