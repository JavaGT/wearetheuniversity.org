<p><strong>Scholarships address teacher shortage</strong></p>
<p>A shortage of qualified teachers in Tokelau has prompted its Government to set up scholarships for students to study at Massey.</p>
<p>Six Tokelauan students will be in Palmerston North for the next three years to study towards their teaching degrees.</p>
<p>There is currently a shortage of qualified and experienced teachers and the majority of its teachers do no have any qualifications.</p>
<p>As a New Zealand territory, Tokelau’s Government wants its teachers to receive the same qualification as kiwi teachers do.</p>
<p>To become a teacher in Tokelau students can attend the University of the South Pacific, but its teaching degree does not meet the education standards in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Most of the group on scholarship are studying the Bachelor of Education, but some are taking other degrees to be able to teach particular subjects at secondary school level.</p>
<p>The youngest of the group, Sebastiano Wright, 18, is taking a short course in university preparation and will then go on to study for a Bachelor of Science majoring in biological sciences.</p>
<p>All of the group have been to New Zealand before but it will be the longest time they have been away from home.</p>
<p>Pule Manuele says the scholarship allowed for three of her five children to come and live in New Zealand with her. She was a teacher in Tokelau but is not qualified under New Zealand requirements.</p>
<p>“Some of us have been lucky enough to have our family come out with us,” she says. “It is daunting though but we’re excited at the same time. There are many differences like the [Manawatū] campus is the same size as one of our islands. There are supermarkets, there is lots of entertainment, big buildings and high staircases.”</p>
<p>Ben Taufua, project manager for the Pasifika at Massey strategy, says Massey was chosen as the preferred university because of its relationship with the Tokelauan Government.</p>
<p>“We (Massey) have connections and relationships with some key people in the Tokelauan Government,” he says. “We need to value this beginning and look to build on it. Our opportunities with Tokelau are endless.”</p>
