<p><strong>Teachers meet to discuss collective agreement</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of primary teachers from all over the country will be meeting from March 12-22 to discuss their collective agreement negotiations. Around 27,000 primary teachers are covered by the collective agreement.</p>
<p>The meetings will be from 12-22 March starting at 1.30pm.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa Vice President Frances Guy says that as well as discussing the offers from the Ministry of Education and the union’s response, the meetings will be looking at wider education issues that frame the negotiations.</p>
<p>“There has been a lack of respect shown toward teachers over the past year or so and there are many issues where the Government response has not been up to standard.</p>
<p>“This includes the handling of Novopay, the closure and merger of Christchurch schools, and the implementation of National Standards and league tables.</p>
<p>“Teachers are not happy about the Government’s Global Education Reform Movement (GERM) agenda which would lead to competition rather than collaboration, more inequity in schools and communities and standardisation in learning rather than meeting an individual’s needs.”</p>
<p>She says schools have consulted with their community widely so that parents have plenty of notice of the meetings and time to make arrangements for their children.</p>
