<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>7 March 2013</p>
<p><strong>Climate Science And Future Climate Governance</strong></p>
<p>One of New Zealand’s leading climate scientists will discuss political and governance issues important to climate change in his inaugural lecture on Tuesday 12 March.</p>
<p>Professor David Frame will examine some of the weaknesses of the Kyoto Protocol, as work begins on an international post-2020 climate agreement, and give his analysis of emerging political tensions between different parts of the developing world about climate change. He will also discuss the need for innovation in the development of international initiatives aimed at limiting climate change.</p>
<p>Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says Victoria’s inaugural lecture series is an excellent opportunity for professors to give an insight into their specialist areas of study with friends, colleagues and the wider community.</p>
<p>“Inaugural lectures have a proud history at Victoria, and are an excellent opportunity for the University to celebrate and acknowledge our valued professors,” says Professor Walsh.</p>
<p>Professor Frame is Director of the New Zealand Climate Change Research Institute at Victoria University. His work as a physicist has included collaborations with economists, policy specialists and other scientists to carry out ground-breaking research into climate change modelling. He joined Victoria University in 2011 from Oxford University, where he was previously Deputy Director of the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment.</p>

<p>The Institute was established at Victoria in 2008 to develop interdisciplinary research into all aspects of climate change. Since then, it has published a significant output of climate research, including a series of nine reports on community vulnerability, resilience and adaptation to climate change.</p>
<p>Last year, the Institute hosted more than 200 contributing authors to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fifth assessment report, and was recently named as one of the world’s top environmental think tanks.</p>
<p>Spaces for Professor Frame’s inaugural lecture are limited. People interested in attending are advised to register for the free event as soon as possible.</p>
