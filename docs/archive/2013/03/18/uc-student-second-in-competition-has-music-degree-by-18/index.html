<p><strong>UC Student Second In National Competition Has Music Degree By The Age Of 18</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>March 18, 2013</strong>  </p>
<p>A University of Canterbury (UC) student, who has just finished runner-up in the national concerto piano competition, has earned a Bachelor of Music degree at the age of just 18.</p>
<p>Stephen Watson, who was home schooled, took just full two years to receive his degree and graduated at the end of last year, still only 18.</p>
<p>UC’s Director of Music Professor Robert Constable said Watson was one of the youngest students ever to graduate from the music school.</p>
<p>Watson is doing honours this year studying piano performance under Professor Michael Endres.</p>
<p>``I was 15 when I started part-time study at UC, taking first-year piano performance and music theory,’’ Watson said today.</p>
<p>``Although I have completed my MusB I decided to continue with Honours this year and graduate with MusB (Hons.), D.V., next year.</p>
<p>``I have performed in many concerts both solo as well as a member of an ensemble in and around Christchurch.</p>
<p>``I have performed regularly in the Outstanding Young Musicians Series of the Music Centre of Christchurch. In 2011, I performed in the Lewis Eady Emerging Artists Series in Auckland and am scheduled to perform again in the series later this year.’’</p>
<p>Watson played Franz Liszt&#39;s Piano Concerto No. 2 in A major to finished second in the national concerto competition in Christchurch last weekend.</p>
<p>He said he always liked the piece and it was recommended by Professor Endres.</p>
<p>``For me, the best thing about studying at UC is the quality of the tuition and in particular being able to study with Professor Endres who is an outstanding pianist and teacher,’’ Watson said.  </p>
