<p><strong>Wednesday, 13 March 2013, 4:40 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong><br>New Zealand First Leader<br>13 March 2013</p>
<p><strong>Solid Energy a Micro-Meddled Mess Thanks to the Government</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First says the Government has micro-meddled Solid Energy into bankruptcy while the company was using borrowed money to pay out dividends.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters says having Solid Energy pay out sizeable dividends when it was losing a serious amount of money has a whiff of fraud about it.</p>
<p>“At the very best it is a case of bungling incompetence which matches the financial disaster with South Canterbury Finance (SCF).</p>
<p>“In that instance, the Government allowed the SCF guarantee to investors to blow out by hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>“The scenario now playing out with Solid Energy comes after Finance Minister Bill English authorised the struggling company to increase debt to $300 million – some of which must have been used to pay dividends.</p>
<p>“The Government would have us believe that it has business expertise. The reality is they didn’t have a clue what they were doing in regards to Solid Energy or SCF.</p>
<p>“It is hard to conceive of a Minister of Finance with so many bungles under his belt as this man,” says Mr Peters.</p>
