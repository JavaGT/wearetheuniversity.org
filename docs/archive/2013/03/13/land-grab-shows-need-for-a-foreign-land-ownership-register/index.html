<p><strong>Land-Grab Shows Need for a Foreign Land Ownership Register</strong></p>
<p>The time is long overdue for the introduction of a comprehensive register of foreign ownership of New Zealand land, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>No one knows how much New Zealand land is in foreign ownership with estimates on foreign control of our farmland alone ranging from one per cent to 8.7 per cent.</p>
<p>Under existing law, Overseas Investment Office approval is only required if foreign nationals intend to buy “sensitive” land with business assets worth more than $100 million.</p>
<p>It creates an inaccurate picture of foreign ownership of New Zealand farmland.</p>
<p>However, there is also no register of foreign land ownership in regards to New Zealand residential property.</p>
<p>Associate Finance spokesperson Andrew Williams says a Foreign Land Ownership Register Member’s Bill is being drafted which would establish the true extent of foreign land ownership.</p>
<p>“The latest example is the sale of eight Waikato dairy farms, totalling 3205 hectares, to Swedish pension fund Forsta AP-fonden.</p>
<p>“But the register needs to go much further and incorporate all New Zealand land in foreign ownership, including residential property.</p>
<p>“Failure to have such information on hand could mean that a massive chunk of New Zealand is sold from under our feet without us even knowing – and the process has already started.</p>
<p>“It’s not just New Zealanders who need to be aware of the great Kiwi land grab.</p>
<p>“Political parties also need accurate land ownership information so they can adopt appropriate policies,” says Mr Williams.</p>
