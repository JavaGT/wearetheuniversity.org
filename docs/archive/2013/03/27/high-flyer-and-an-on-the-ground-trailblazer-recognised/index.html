<p>Media Release<br>27 March 2013<br><em>- for immediate release</em></p>
<p><strong>A ‘high flyer’ and an ‘on-the-ground’ trailblazer recognised in Lincoln University awards</strong></p>
<p>A leader in business, and an engineering and water trailblazer are recognised by Lincoln University with its top achievement awards announced today. The awards – one honorary doctorate and one medal – will be presented at the University’s Graduation Ceremony on Friday 12 April 2013.</p>
<p>“John Palmer, well known for his chairmanship of Air New Zealand has been awarded an honorary doctor of commerce, and Dr Terence Heiler, who has spent his career engaged in sustainable water management and irrigation, has been awarded the Lincoln University Bledisloe Medal” says Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor Dr Andrew West.</p>
<p>“John, a graduate of Lincoln, has a track record of successfully leading change and strategic development in businesses undergoing significant transformations in various industries. Since his appointment to chair the Air New Zealand board in 2001, he has governed them through a hugely successful period of rebuilding.</p>
<p>“A former long-serving staff member and doctoral graduate Dr Terry Heiler has been instrumental with the integrated simulation design of irrigation systems throughout New Zealand that remains to this day. Terry’s capacity to see the ‘big picture’ and to establish and implement meaningful action plans in farms systems are two fundamental traits that have distinguished his career.</p>
<p>“These two gentlemen have made a significant, notable and most positive impression on New Zealand. It gives the University great pleasure to publicly acknowledge their respective achievements in conferring these awards at Graduation this year.”</p>
<p><strong>Mr John Palmer, Honorary Doctor of Commerce</strong>: Since completing a Bachelor of Agricultural Science in 1968, majoring in Farm Management and Economics at Lincoln University, John Palmer has become a leader in governance, with major contributions in a wide range of industries, including kiwifruit, airline, energy and banking. It was as chairman of the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board that John first came to national prominence. Previous governance roles include Trust Bank Canterbury, Wrightson Ltd and Solid Energy. Mr Palmer’s current governance roles include chairman of Air New Zealand, since 2001 and in 2012 he was appointed chairman of Rabobank New Zealand Ltd, a part of the leading international agribusiness banking organisation.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Terence Heiler, Bledisloe Medal</strong>: Dr Terence (Terry) Heiler has a passion for engineering and water that has stimulated his life’s work. A doctoral graduate and former long-serving staff member of Lincoln University, Dr Heiler led Lincoln University’s thrust into the commercial research and development sphere, transforming a number of organisations. He left Lincoln University in the mid-1990s to pursue private consultancy work specialising in water management and irrigation and has been involved in some 40 projects in 20 different countries. In 2006 he was appointed inaugural chief executive of Irrigation New Zealand (INZ) before retiring in 2010. Currently Dr Heiler is an advisory board member for the National Infrastructure Unit, a Treasury unit assisting the Government to lift the sustainable growth rate of the economy, and is on the Regional Committee of the Canterbury Water Management Strategy.</p>

<p><strong>About the Awards</strong><br>The Lincoln University Council established an Honorary Degrees Committee in November 1992 to enable it to confer higher doctorates <em>honoris causa</em>, with the first honorary doctorates awarded in 1993. An honorary doctorate is awarded to a person who has an established connection with Lincoln University to recognise their achievement in his or her chosen field.</p>
<p>The Bledisloe Medal, initiated in 1930 by the late Viscount Bledisloe, former Governor-General of New Zealand, is awarded to a former student or past or current staff member of Lincoln University who, in the opinion of the Lincoln University Council, has made an outstanding contribution in his or her chosen field, advanced New Zealand&#39;s interests, and/or brought credit to Lincoln University.</p>
