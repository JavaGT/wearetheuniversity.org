<p><strong>Government Flouts High Court Ruling Over Salisbury School</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First says it is unacceptable that the Government has ignored a High Court ruling to keep Salisbury School open and instead is trying to shut it through dodgy backdoor politics.</p>
<p>Disability Issues spokesperson Barbara Stewart says this year Salisbury School has a record low number of pupils which is all down to the Government’s behind-the-scenes meddling.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Education has received more than nine applications since September that could have boosted role numbers had they not been declined.</p>
<p>“The special needs students that attend Salisbury School need the stable social and learning environment it provides.</p>
<p>“Instead they are going to place these young girls education in jeopardy by forcing them into mainstream schools. That is unfair.”</p>
<p>Mrs Stewart says the Government won’t even listen to Salisbury School, having declined the chance to visit the school and hear their ideas.</p>
<p>“All this Government cares about is money. They need to start heeding the High Court ruling and look after the futures of deserving young New Zealanders,” says Mrs Stewart.  </p>
