<p><strong>Wednesday, 27 March 2013, 1:02 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong><br>New Zealand First Leader<br>27 March 2013  </p>
<p><strong>Christchurch Overstayer Must Leave New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is asking why the Government hasn’t kicked out overstayer Harmon Wilfred who remains living in Christchurch despite failing twice to be granted NZ citizenship.</p>
<p>Mr Wilfred was also declined refugee status after he renounced his US citizenship after claiming there was a vendetta against him by high-placed US officials.</p>
<p>This week it was revealed that Mr Wilfred’s main trading company, La Famia No 2 Ltd, was put into liquidation owing nearly $300,000 to Inland Revenue. General creditors are owed $246,000.</p>
<p>Mr Wilfred’s business affairs in New Zealand are littered with similar financial disasters.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters says there is no way Mr Wilfred should still be living in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“He is an overstayer.</p>
<p>“He has no legal right to be living here yet the Government has done nothing to move him on.</p>
<p>“The folly of that decision can now be counted in taxpayer dollars through his failed company.”</p>
<p>“Reading Mr Wilfred’s turgid history beggars belief.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says Mr Wilfred received the support of National MP David Carter, now the Speaker of the House, to remain in this country.</p>
<p>“In his written letter of support Mr Carter praised Mr Wilfred for his ‘considerable business interests’, and said Mr Wilfred and his Canadian wife Carolyn Dare-Wilfred were ‘committed, contributing members of our Christchurch community’.</p>

<p>“Let’s see if Mr Carter will reiterate that support to Mr Wilfred’s former employees, general creditors, and Inland Revenue who are collectively owed hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>“The reality is Mr Wilfred should either seek Canadian residency so he can legally live there with his wife, or the Government should deport him to the US.</p>
<p>“There should be no ifs, buts, or maybes. Mr Wilfred is an overstayer who must be dealt with now,” says Mr Peters.  </p>
