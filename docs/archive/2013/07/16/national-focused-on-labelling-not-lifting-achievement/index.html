<p><strong>National focused on labelling – not lifting achievement</strong></p>
<p>Labelling a third of Year 8 students as failures will do nothing to lift achievement and highlights many of the problems with the National Government’s approach, says Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins.</p>
<p>“National rushed the introduction and implementation of national standards without a trial and despite many legitimate concerns being raised by the teaching profession. It’s no wonder things aren’t going to plan.</p>
<p>“Any reports that achievement is waning deserve consideration, but the government’s first port of call should be teachers themselves. Tick-box data sets, which teachers have said can be ropey and unreliable, will not get to the bottom of underachievement in our schools.</p>
<p>“Continually measuring the problem won’t do anything to fix it. We don’t need national standards to know which students are falling behind, countless studies have already told us.</p>
<p>“We don’t need national standards to identify the solutions either, we already have some excellent professional development programmes that have successfully raised achievement amongst students who have typically struggled.</p>
<p>“We all want to raise our kids’ performance, but telling them they aren’t meeting the mark, without offering extra support to succeed is no use to anyone.</p>
<p>“Tying teachers up with data-laden deadlines isn’t helping our kids get ahead either.</p>
<p>“What teachers are telling me is that they are fed-up with this government’s own-goal approach to education. The focus cannot continue to be on data collection and labelling, our education policy must be centred around students.”</p>
