<p><strong>Expert to discuss building sustainability into public landscapes</strong></p>
<p>Australian architect Perry Lethlean will visit Victoria University next week to deliver a free public lecture on how cities can incorporate sustainable ideas into urban design.</p>
<p>The lecture, titled <em>Waterfront work and public infrastructure by building sustainability into public landscapes</em> will focus on the role of landscape and nature in shaping the form, quality and character of our cities, and will be followed by a question and answer session.</p>
<p>Mr Lethlean’s experience varies from the preparation of large-scale urban design frameworks and master plans, to the detailed design of urban spaces, master planning and design of tertiary institutions and working with Local and State Government agencies.</p>
<p>He has led the successful implementation of complex landscape and urban projects such as the Geelong Waterfront Redevelopment, Forest Gallery at the Melbourne Museum and the Wynyard Quarter in Auckland.</p>
<p>Before the public lecture, Mr Lethlean will present a Masterclass for Master’s students from Victoria’s Faculty of Architecture and Design about waterfront infrastructure and best practice for a liveable city.</p>
<p>His visit is supported by the New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects Education Foundation.  </p>
