<p><strong>UC student wins trip to Melbourne in Asia-Pacific Naked CEO competition</strong></p>
<p><strong>July 16, 2013</strong></p>
<p>A University of Canterbury (UC) fourth year business student, Nicole Van Dugteren, is one of six Asia-Pacific winners in the Australian-organised Naked CEO Boardroom competition.</p>
<p>The event is run by professional accounting organisation CPA Australia which is one of the largest accounting bodies in the world.</p>
<p>Van Dugteren’s prize is a four night visit to Melbourne later this month. She will receive two days of mentoring from the CPA chief executive Alex Malley and will sit in on CPA board meetings.</p>
<p>To qualify for Melbourne, students were asked to submit an accounting question to the CPA chief executive Alex Malley via The Naked CEO website (<a href="http://www.thenakedceo.com">www.thenakedceo.com</a>). The six best questions were judged by Malley. The five other winners are from Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
<p>The July 24 to 26 trip gives the winners a look at the day to day role of an accounting chief executive. CPA Australia is a global professional accountancy body with 132,000 members in 116 countries.</p>
<p>The visit will help Van Dugteren bridge the gap between theory and the raw reality of life on the road to leadership success.</p>
<p>This is the third year in a row a UC student has won the major CPA Australia competition. In 2011 Tim Brand won the Make Your Mark competition and a trip to Sydney to meet Commander Neil Armstrong, the first person to land on the moon.</p>
<p>Last year, Pip Widdon won the New Zealand Big Break competition and a trip to Melbourne to compete in the grand final, presenting her business case for The Make-a-Wish Foundation to a panel of judges.</p>
