<p>Wheel clamping company runs money-making racket</p>
<p>A wheel clamping company is fleecing unsuspecting mums and dads, picking their kids up from school, of thousands of dollars, Labour MP for Mt Roskill Phil Goff says.</p>
<p>A supermarket car park, opposite Mt Roskill Primary School, is a popular point used by parents of three schools wanting a safe place to pick their children up from.</p>
<p>“I understand the concern of retailers who want the car park available for their customers.</p>
<p>“But the NZ Wheel Clamping Company is using enforcement as a money-making racket, with motorists copping hefty charges for parking there for less than two minutes.</p>
<p>“The company takes photos of cars using the car park, some of which belong to supermarket shoppers, then follows up with a bill for $100.</p>
<p>“If that’s not paid within two weeks ‘administration fees’ are charged, adding hundreds of dollars to the original bill, and debt collectors may be called in.</p>
<p>“In one case a local business owner - who used the park for a total of one minute while he opened a garage adjacent to it - had a $100 fee imposed. Another who parked outside an empty warehouse for two minutes was clamped and had to pay $200.</p>
<p>“Worse, a number of parents with English as a second language have received bills of up to $500 for being in the car park for minutes without realising they were doing anything wrong.</p>
<p>“The company is fleecing people who can ill-afford it. Yes, there is a problem for the retailers, but this is not the answer.”</p>

<p>Mr Goff has called a meeting of local school principals, board representatives and Auckland Transport to try to find a solution.</p>
<p>“In the meantime people should know that advice from the Automobile Association and Consumer Affairs is that the Wheel Clamping Company has no statutory authority to fine people,” he said.</p>
<p>“Rather than pay the bill people should invite the Company to take the matter to a Disputes Tribunal.”<br>ends</p>
