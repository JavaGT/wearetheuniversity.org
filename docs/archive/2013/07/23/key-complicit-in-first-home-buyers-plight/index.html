<p><strong>Key complicit in first home buyers’ plight</strong></p>
<p>John Key must be kidding with his claim today that first home buyers are a priority for the National Government, says the Labour Leader David Shearer.</p>
<p>“The dream of home ownership is already beyond the reach of hundreds of thousands of Kiwis, and when the Reserve Bank introduces limits on high Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) lending things will only get worse.</p>
<p>“John Key’s Government gave the Reserve Bank the power to use LVRs knowing full well it could add $50-60,000 to the deposit for an average Auckland house.</p>
<p>“Who will be able to afford to find that sort of money? Certainly not first home buyers.</p>
<p>“John Key wants the New Zealanders to believe that the problems facing first home buyers are nothing to do with him. In fact they are a direct result of his inaction.</p>
<p>“The National Government has failed to address the real issues in the housing market. John Key’s out of touch, and he’s put the interests of property speculators ahead of people looking to buy their first home.</p>
<p>“Labour will roll up its sleeves and tackle both supply and demand. We will build 100,000 affordable homes over 10 years for first time buyers. We’ll tax property speculation to take the heat out of the market. And we will protect first home buyers with an interim exemption from LVRs until the rampant housing market is brought under control.</p>
<p>“Labour’s plan will give first home buyers hope, and a realistic chance to get into an affordable home that they can call their own,” says David Shearer.</p>
