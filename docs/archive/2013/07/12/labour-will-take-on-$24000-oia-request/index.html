<p><strong>Friday, 12 July 2013, 1:02 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour will take on $24,000 OIA request</p>
<p>Labour’s newly appointed Earthquake Commission spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove says he will take on the OIA from a Canterbury community group that EQC disgracefully proposed to charge $24,000 for information.  </p>
<p>“The Wider Earthquake Communities Action Network of Canterbury (WECAN) was told by the Earthquake Commission that it would be charged $24,000 just to respond to a simple request for information. That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p>“This is a community group that is trying to help earthquake victims, advocate for them and get them information. But it has no money. They can’t afford to pay for this. The people of Canterbury want solutions. I’m going to help get them.</p>
<p>“As an MP the Ombudsman has ruled I am entitled to OIAs free of charge. I have today spoken to WECAN’s Sarah O’Brien. She has given me her OIA and I will lodge it with EQC as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“I extend this offer to other community advocacy groups that are being charged for their right to request official information. The people of Canterbury have a right to answers without being handed a bill a lawyer would be proud of.</p>
<p>“I will get stuck in and help the people of Canterbury. Cantabrians want solutions and faster progress in this recovery. To get that faster progress they need information, not a bill. I will do my best to get that information for them,” says Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
