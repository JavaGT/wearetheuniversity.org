<p>Government commits $90 million to AUT’s Manukau Campus</p>
<p>AUT University’s Vice Chancellor, Derek McCormack, welcomes the announcement by the Prime Minister, Rt Hon John Key, alongside the Ministers of Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment and Māori Affairs, today that the government will provide 4100 new equivalent full time students (EFTS) to the value of $90 million to support AUT’s Manukau campus expansion.</p>
<p>Mr McCormack thanked the government for their faith in AUT, “We have a part to play in increasing university access for all. AUT has increased student placements by 12,000 and last year alone celebrated 7000 graduates. We now have the ability to grow the Manukau campus student enrolments.”</p>
<p>During his announcement the Prime Minister John Key stated, “Tertiary education is a passport for success in modern life. It’s not just about skills, but the pride that graduates bring to their families. One family member enjoys success at university and the rest will follow. They become a role model for their family and community.</p>
<p>“AUT has brought AUT University to the heart of the Manukau community. What is being offered is in line with what the community needs and the expanded campus will contribute to that growth.”</p>
<p>In March 2010 the Prime Minister officially opened the Manukau campus and in December 2012 the first 200 students graduated, 50 of whom gained postgraduate qualifications. AUT is on track this year to have 750 enrolments on Manukau campus and 1000 by 2014.</p>
<p>The Hon Steven Joyce also made a public commitment to the growth of tertiary education in South Auckland, “It is no longer enough to have school qualifications as there is greater competition for skilled jobs. We need to lift provision in Auckland, and in particular in Manukau, as the growth in youth population is twice that of the national rate.</p>

<p>“We have a goal of 55% of all 25-34 year olds having a tertiary education qualification in New Zealand. A huge amount of work needs to be done to reach this target and I am confident that AUT, as the best young and vibrant university in New Zealand, will contribute to this.”</p>
<p>Further to the statements made by the Prime Minister and Steven Joyce, Hon Dr Pita Sharples expressed his support of the announcement. “Māori are the first to be laid off in tough times and the last to be re-employed, and we know that is the result of an education gap. A one-size-fits-all approach to education does not work – we need to provide choice for our Māori and Pacific students. AUT strives to provide this choice and deserves the title the University of the Changing World.”</p>
<p>The first commitment of the university will be to provide a wider variety of majors to enable more students to complete their full degree on campus.</p>
