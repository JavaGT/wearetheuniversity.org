<p>MPs’ chance to do the right thing</p>
<p>The Green Party welcomes the decision of the Speaker to allow a personal vote on the New Zealand International Convention Centre as an opportunity for MPs to vote with their conscience and help protect people from the harm of problem gambling.</p>
<p>Parliament’s Speaker David Carter has written to the whips of all political parties to let them know that the first reading of the NZICC Bill tomorrow will be treated as a personal vote.</p>
<p>The Green Party believes it is not too late for MPs to use their personal vote tomorrow to protect Aucklanders, children and families against the dangers in this Bill.</p>
<p>“This is the time for Auckland MPs, and for those with a history of concern about the dangers of gambling, to make a stand for what is right for their people,” Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said.</p>
<p>“This is a dirty deal that seeks to trade the safety of people off against a supposedly free convention centre. It breaches the protections in the Gambling Act, defies the rule of law and gives a special privilege to SkyCity that no other person or business in New Zealand is allowed.</p>
<p>“This is a real opportunity for MPs to make their vote count for the people and issues that matter to them.</p>
<p>“I’m confident that MPs will look seriously at the evidence from the Government that shows that thousands of children will be harmed by this legislation and will not want their name associated with it.</p>
<p>“This is also an opportunity for Aucklanders and anyone who cares about the damage inflicted on children and families from problem gambling, to contact their MPs and make their feelings known.</p>

<p>“Together we can see this disastrous Bill defeated at its first hurdle,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
