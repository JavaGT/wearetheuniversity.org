<p><strong>Wednesday, 10 July 2013, 6:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National’s tertiary target falls short</p>
<p>Minister of Tertiary Education, Stephen Joyce is failing to meet his own better public service targets. His attempts to get more New Zealanders qualified to level 4 are missing the mark, says Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Megan Woods.</p>
<p>“In Parliament today Mr Joyce attempted to put a positive a shine on concerning projections. He may have been claiming that “very good progress” was being made towards the 2017 target of 45,000 people aged between 25-34 achieving a level 4 or higher qualification, but weighing on his mind must have been the 25% projected shortfall on this target.</p>
<p>“Budget papers show that Treasury predicts the Government will fall 11 250 people short of their better public service target. Treasury estimated that 3 500 people would come through migration, leaving a gap of 7750 people.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong with setting targets and striving to achieve them, but the National Government has explicitly set out to dampen demand for tertiary education.</p>
<p>“Treasury also suggests that to meet the targets the minister will need to ‘stimulate additional demand’. National is doing the opposite.</p>
<p>“Minister Joyce and the National Government need to stop treating education as a cost to be cut and squeezing the sector for every penny.</p>
<p>If they’re truly committed to achieving these coveted targets they set for themselves, they should treat education for what it is, an important investment in our country’s future.”<br>ends</p>
