<p><strong>Award-winning UC graduate opens art exhibition at Ilam Campus Gallery</strong></p>
<p><strong>July 10, 2013</strong></p>
<p>University of Canterbury (UC) award-winning fine arts graduate Laura Marsh has opened an exhibition at the Ilam Campus Gallery.</p>
<p>Marsh has a fine arts degree from UC and is the current recipient of the Olivia Spencer Bower Foundation Award.</p>
<p>Her exhibition, which runs until August 2, is titled <em>Home is Where the Gorse is.</em></p>
<p>``My intention for my year as the Spencer Bower recipient was to further my Masters project.</p>
<p>``This exhibition is in response to my experience of reconnecting to my home, the South Island, after living in the Auckland region for six years.</p>
<p>``I was looking to remedy a sense of dislocation I had defined during my Masters. I came to understand that this was part of being a descendant of colonial settlers to this land.</p>
<p>``Through returning home I have gained a greater love for my homeland and a deeper understanding and acceptance of what it means to be a South Islander.</p>
<p>``This exhibition is a collection of artefacts representing this journey,’’ Marsh says.</p>
<p>The Olivia Spencer Bower Foundation Award was set up in 1987 and is building a reputation as an outstanding art award.</p>
<p>Among the previous winners includes UC graduate and outstanding New Zealand artist Seraphine Pick, who won in 1994.</p>
