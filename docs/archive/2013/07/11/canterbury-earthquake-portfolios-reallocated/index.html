<p><strong>Canterbury earthquake portfolios reallocated</strong></p>
<p>The Labour Leader David Shearer has today named new spokespeople in two key Canterbury earthquake portfolios.</p>
<p>The minor reshuffle follows Lianne Dalziel’s decision to stand for the Christchurch mayoralty.</p>
<p>Clayton Cosgrove will take over responsibility for the Earthquake Commission, while Ruth Dyson becomes Canterbury Earthquake Recovery spokesperson.</p>
<p>Wigram MP Megan Woods also picks up an Associate Education role, working with Chris Hipkins on Christchurch schools. The new delegation comes on top of her work as Associate Transport spokesperson for Christchurch.</p>
<p>“Lianne Dalziel will stay on as Associate Justice and Civil Defence and Emergency Management spokesperson. I’ve appointed Louisa Wall as associate Civil Defence and Emergency spokesperson and it is my intention that she will take over the full role when Lianne Dalziel leaves Parliament.</p>
<p>“Lianne Dalziel has done sterling work as Labour’s Earthquake Recovery and EQC spokesperson. She has stood up for the people of Christchurch and driven Labour’s grassroots approach to tackling the rebuild. I thank her for her hard work and commitment, and know she will continue to support and advocate for Cantabrians.</p>
<p>“But given her bid for the Christchurch mayoralty, Lianne agrees that the time is right for others to step into those roles.</p>
<p>“In Clayton Cosgrove and Ruth Dyson, Labour has two of its most experienced and capable MPs ready to take over. They are in touch with the reality of the challenges the city and the region face, and they will do an outstanding job.</p>

<p>“I’m also pleased to give Megan Woods an expanded role in the vital area of Christchurch schools. Since her election in 2011 she has proved herself to be a talented MP, and is more than ready to take on extra responsibility.</p>
<p>“Labour has a great team of Christchurch MPs, and I know this new line-up of spokespeople will continue Labour’s record of fighting hard for the people of Christchurch,” says David Shearer.</p>
