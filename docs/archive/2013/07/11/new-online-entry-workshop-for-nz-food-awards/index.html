<p>New online entry workshop for NZ Food Awards</p>
<p>The clock is ticking for companies to enter the 2013 NZ Food Awards, and this year organisers are offering an online workshop to help companies complete the entry form.</p>
<p>National Events and Sponsorship Director Denise Armstrong says offering the online workshop will provide companies with answers and information in advance of the closing date.</p>
<p>“For companies taking that first step of entering the NZ Food Awards, the online workshop is a great opportunity to demystify the process, and get some advice from the experts. It also offers previous entrants a chance to work out what other categories they could enter and help boost their company’s profile.</p>
<p>“It’s a chance to think a little differently, and could mean uniting the marketing and food technology teams in a business for their best-ever entry in the NZ Food Awards,” she says.</p>
<p>The online workshop will be held from 12 noon until 1pm on July 12, with experts ready and willing to answer questions. To access the online workshops, participants need to download Adobe Connect, and then access it here: connect.massey.ac.nz/nzfoodawards</p>
<p>Offering online support is not the only new component to this year’s awards. Adding its expertise as a supporting sponsor is digital brand agency Flavour. The Napier-based company specialises in marketing communications for the food and beverages sector, with clients across the primary industries – from growers through to producers and manufacturers.</p>

We’re savouring the opportunity to support New Zealand’s growing food and beverage manufacturers and producers.”</p>
