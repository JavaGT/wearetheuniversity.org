<p><strong>Thursday, 11 July 2013, 4:16 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>David<br>SHEARER<br>Labour Leader</p>
<p>11 July 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>John Key’s legacy – more problem gambling</strong></p>
<p>“John Key’s backroom deal with casino operator SkyCity will leave a trail of misery in its wake,” says Labour leader David Shearer.</p>
<p>“This deal shows just how out of touch John Key is. As a direct result of this deal there will be 8000 extra problem gamblers. And New Zealanders agree – that’s why 60 per cent of them are opposed to it.</p>
<p>“This deal has been dodgy since day one. John Key has traded away a law change that he knows will increase problem gambling.</p>
<p>“The bill allows SkyCity to significantly expand its gambling facilities, with more pokies and more gaming tables. It gives the casino the freedom to introduce ticket in – ticket out systems, cashless gambling and the ability to increase playing limits.</p>
<p>“Worst of all it tries to bind the hands of future Parliaments for 35 years. That is outrageous, and Labour will fight this bill every step of the way.</p>
<p>“Although the National-led Government has done the deal, Parliament is sovereign and a future Labour Government reserves the right to change gambling laws should we consider the cost to the community is too high.</p>
<p>“Labour supports the building of an international convention centre in Auckland. But getting problem gamblers to fund the project is morally wrong.</p>
<p>“John Key might think building an international convention centre is his legacy to Auckland. But the truth is that the legacy of this deal will be the damage done to thousands of families because of increased problem gambling,” says David Shearer.</p>
