<p><strong>UC researcher investigating impacts of mining in New Zealand on Iwi</strong></p>
<p><strong>July 11, 2013</strong></p>
<p>A University of Canterbury (UC) researcher is investigating the impacts of mining in New Zealand on iwi.</p>
<p>At UC’s Ngai Tahu Research Centre, Sarah Down is exploring the legal issues and evolving negotiations occurring between iwi, corporations and the Crown over mining in New Zealand.</p>
<p>``This is unchartered territory in many ways and will contribute to a wider understanding of how indigenous peoples participate in, or are excluded from, decisions concerning natural resources.</p>
<p>``While there is a substantial body of literature on indigenous peoples and the extraction of natural resources in Australia, Canada, the United States and other countries, there has been very little written on this subject in New Zealand.</p>
<p>``This issue is topical given the New Zealand Government’s plans for greater exploitation of natural resources, particularly in Northland and Taranaki.</p>
<p>``Onshore exploration blocks in Taranaki, the North Island&#39;s east coast, and three offshore areas of Cape Reinga-Northland are being offered up for petroleum exploration.</p>
<p>``Plans for further exploitation of New Zealand’s natural resources have come at a time in New Zealand’s history when iwi are more visible in public arenas and are able to exert greater pressure on governments and extraction industries morally, politically and legally.</p>
<p>``Increasing knowledge about legal rights and iwi ability to influence decisions over natural resources is important as overseas research has demonstrated this as a key factor in creating the best outcomes for communities and, more specifically, indigenous peoples.</p>

<p>``How iwi choose to respond and their ability to influence decisions that are made is sure to be an issue for iwi in future years as they consider the impacts such developments have on their ancestral lands and their people. Natural resource extraction is an issue which puts at the forefront how indigenous people define themselves, their relationship to the land, and their futures.</p>
<p>``I want to look at rights guaranteed to iwi as indigenous peoples under international law and domestic legislation with a particular emphasis on the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
<p>``It is important to remember that many of the areas where mining has been proposed are places where there are few economic opportunities, with Northland being a prime example. Recent Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment figures show that 44.9 percent of Maori in that area are unemployed.”</p>
<p>However, whether the economic benefits of mining will flow back to iwi is another question. Examples from other countries show that, in reality, the indigenous people receive little benefit, although the ability of the local people to drive a hard bargain tends to have a major bearing on outcomes, Down says.  </p>
