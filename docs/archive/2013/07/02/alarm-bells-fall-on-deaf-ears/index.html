<p>Lianne<br>DALZIEL<br>Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson<br>MP for Christchurch East</p>
<p>2 July 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Alarm bells fall on deaf ears</strong></p>
<p>Revelations that Gerry Brownlee knew nothing about the accreditation issue bedevilling the Christchurch City Council until just over a fortnight ago, will raise a few eyebrows, even amongst his own colleagues, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Lianne Dalziel.</p>
<p>“Just yesterday in his post-Cabinet press conference, Prime Minister John Key said that consenting was ‘core business’ for the council. Yet today, Earthquake Minister Gerry Brownlee -- who John Key put in charge of Canterbury’s recovery -- brushed it off as detail he couldn’t be expected to be across.</p>
<p>“What rubbish. Issuing consents is about building -- we are in the midst of a r_ebuild_ – I’m not sure what could be more important to a minister tasked with recovery than ensuring that the city is, in fact, recovering.</p>
<p>“The difference in opinion between Mr Key and Mr Brownlee is just more evidence of a lack of communication and leadership.</p>
<p>“The September IANZ report warned the Christchurch City Council that continued accreditation beyond May 2013 was dependent on a satisfactory outcome of that assessment, and yet nothing was said to the Minister by his department or by his ministerial colleague, Maurice Williamson.</p>
<p>“That’s poor handling, plain and simple.</p>
<p>“In the first instance the IANZ report should have set off alarm bells within the council. That warning should have been loud enough to be heard in CERA next door.</p>
<p>“According to the legislation that gives the government extraordinary powers, CERA was established ‘to facilitate, co-ordinate, and direct the planning, rebuilding, and recovery of affected communities, including the repair and rebuilding of land, infrastructure, and other property’.</p>
<p>“It seems the authorities weren’t just asleep at the wheel, they forgot to put air in the tyres, petrol in the tank and start the motor,” Lianne Dalziel said.</p>
