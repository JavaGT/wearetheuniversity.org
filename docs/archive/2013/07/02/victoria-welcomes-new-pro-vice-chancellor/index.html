<p>Victoria welcomes new Pro Vice-Chancellor</p>
<p>Professor Mike Wilson has joined Victoria University as the new Pro Vice-Chancellor of Science, Engineering and Architecture and Design.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says he is delighted with Professor Wilson’s appointment.</p>
<p>“Professor Wilson has an established record of strategic, academic and administrative leadership and will bring valuable experience to the high performing teams in these faculties.”</p>
<p>Professor Wilson was previously Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physical Sciences at the University of Leeds, where he also held a Chair in Applied Mathematics. Prior to being appointed Dean he was Head of the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds.</p>
<p>His career began as a PhD student with the Radio Astronomy Group in the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, where he specialised in astrophysical fluid dynamics. After moving to Leeds as a research fellow, Professor Wilson worked with colleagues to develop innovative numerical simulations of astrophysical jets, which were the first of their type.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Professor Wilson became involved in the field of computer-aided geometric and functional design and was a co-inventor of a new method for the design of surface shape, known as the Partial Differential Equation Method. The method has received widespread international recognition and has been applied in ship and aircraft design.</p>
<p>Professor Wilson has significant experience working with research colleagues, business and industry partners on international research projects and gaining external funding grants.</p>
<p>He replaces Professor David Bibby, who has retired but will be working with the New Zealand Climate Change Research Institute at Victoria University.</p>
<p>In addition to his role as Pro Vice-Chancellor of Science, Engineering and Architecture and Design, Professor Wilson also takes up the position of Dean of the Faculty of Science.</p>
