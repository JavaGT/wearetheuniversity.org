<p><strong>Lincoln University’s rural leaders programme aims to address shortage</strong></p>
<p>Lincoln University’s Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme is helping to shape the future of agribusiness and rural affairs in New Zealand, with applications opening 1 August for aspiring leaders to complete the course in 2014.</p>
<p>Accepting 20 applicants each year, the Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme has strict selection criteria, and is designed for people who have demonstrated their commitment to rural New Zealand and shown willingness to take on leadership roles.</p>
<p>Lincoln University has been involved with the leaders programme since 1976, when it was launched with a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, USA. The yearlong programme will next year celebrate its thirtieth intake of students in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme Academic Director Dr. Patrick Aldwell says by the end of this year, a total of 650 ‘Kelloggers’ will have completed the course – many of whom have gone on to become very successful within the rural sector.</p>
<p>“There have been participants that have gone on to do extraordinary things for rural New Zealand,” says Dr. Aldwell. “But the main aim of the course is to help to establish the next generation of leaders. There’s a real shortage in the rural community as current leaders are beginning to withdraw.”</p>
<p>Age is no barrier when it comes to completing the programme. This year, Lincoln University has selected their youngest attendee — Mary Johnson, who is 22 years old.</p>

<p>“It’s important for young people to do the course, as they are the future of rural New Zealand,” says Dr. Aldwell. “But it is just as significant for those already established in the industry. For course attendees aged between 40 and 60 years, it can be really beneficial – opening their eyes to new opportunities and new ways of thinking. It can also expand their horizons and facilitate entry into new roles, such as mentoring.</p>
<p>“The programme offers participants the confidence to take ‘the next big step’ and encourages people to step outside their comfort zone. It also places an emphasis on networking – utilising the knowledge, skills and experience of those who have completed the course in the past.”</p>
<p>Past course attendees form a successful and well-informed network of rural people, says Dr. Aldwell. To leverage this connection, each intake of new course members are given the contact details for past participants, who are able to be called upon for advice, mentorship and information.</p>
<p>“Networking is key, not only within each course, but also within the wider Kellogg network,” says Dr. Aldwell. “If someone wants to take the next step, or do something different, they can contact someone in that field for guidance and support.”</p>
<p>While the leadership programme is highly regarded throughout the rural and agriculture sectors, one of the misconceptions about the course is that it is just for farmers. Dr Aldwell says the course is focused on the wider rural community.</p>
<p>“The Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme is not just for those who work specifically in rural or agriculture businesses, but is open to anyone who lives and works within a rural area or community,” says Dr. Aldwell. “Over the years, we’ve had a wide range of applicants – from nurses to school principals, and bankers to politicians. This year, one of our successful applicants is a veterinarian – a first for the course.”</p>
<p>Lincoln University awarded Murchison veterinarian Michael Lilley a Kellogg scholarship to attend the course as part of his first prize win at the 2012 Young Farmer Contest. The 2011 Young Farmer Contest winner, William Grayling, is also attending this year’s Kellogg course through a Lincoln University scholarship.</p>
<p>Dr. Aldwell says another important network is the long-standing partnerships formed with the programme’s sponsors, including DairyNZ, Beef + Lamb New Zealand, Deer Industry New Zealand, Pipfruit New Zealand, and Zespri International.</p>
<p>“These ongoing relationships are not just about funding,” says Dr. Aldwell. “They are also about different industries contributing to the programme for the benefit of the participants and rural economy. It is important for our up-and-coming leaders to learn how different parts of the rural community can be impacted by the same issues, and also how to work together with other industries to overcome challenges, as well as develop new opportunities.”</p>
<p>The Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme incorporates residential workshops, seminars and personal study over an 11-month period. The first stage is a ten-day residential induction course at Lincoln University at the beginning of the year, where participants focus on the dimensions that make a leader.</p>
<p>In the second, non-residential phase, participants select a topic of interest and complete a research project, which is presented to their fellow Kellogg participants in phase three at Lincoln University. The course then moves to Wellington for two and a half days for attendees to study the mechanism of government and the political process. They are also able to interview chief executive officers, politicians and other industry leaders about the practical nature of their leadership styles.</p>
<p>Applications for the 2014 Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme open in August 2013. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/krlp">www.lincoln.ac.nz/krlp</a>.</p>
