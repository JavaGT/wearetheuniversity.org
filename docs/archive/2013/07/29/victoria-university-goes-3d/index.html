<p><strong>Monday, 29 July 2013, 9:57 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Victoria University goes 3D</strong></p>
<p>A kiwi feather cloak, a jug from 1890 and samurai armour from 1735 are just some of 100 objects that will be filmed in 3D in a new partnership between Victoria University and Te Papa.</p>
<p>As the first university in New Zealand to work with 3D production, Victoria University’s Film Programme is partnering with Te Papa to create 3D images of objects from the museum’s collection. They will be assisted by experts from Weta Workshop’s miniatures department.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to learn more about 3D technology so that it can be incorporated into Victoria’s film production and theory classes next year. However, film lecturer and award-winning documentary filmmaker Dr Paul Wolffram says he wanted to learn about the University’s new 3D camera through a project that would benefit the community.</p>
<p>“Our project will create a resource for Te Papa while also giving us the opportunity to learn about the process of 3D image creation in a controlled environment,” he says.</p>
<p>“Te Papa has a mandate to allow public access to its collections—this is a way to help them do this safely without causing damage to precious objects.”</p>
<p>“Museums around the world are looking at 3D technologies—including imaging techniques and 3D printing—to provide new and exciting ways to view, interact with and better understand museum objects,” says Philip Edgar, Manager Digital Collections and Access at Te Papa.</p>
<p>“Te Papa is very excited to be part of the 3D filming partnership with Victoria University and begin exploring these technologies.”</p>

<p>The Film Programme is inviting staff, students and alumni to participate in the project, which is headed by Victoria staff members Dr Paul Wolffram and Dr Miriam Ross, along with three-time Oscar winner for visual effects Alex Funke.</p>
<p>“There is no ‘how to’ book on the subject, so we will learn by doing,” says Dr Wolffram.</p>
<p>“We are fortunate to have the assistance of experienced cinematographer Alex Funke, who works for Weta Workshop and has taught a film production course at the University in the past.”</p>
<p>The first meeting of the 3D production initiative will take place at Kelburn Campus on Thursday 1 August at 6.30pm. Anyone who is interested in being part of the project should email <a href="mailto:miriam.ross@vuw.ac.nz">miriam.ross@vuw.ac.nz</a>.<br>ends</p>
