<p><strong>Women’s Week Set to Highlight Gender Issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>29th July through to the 2nd of August</strong></p>
<p>The Otago University Students’ Association is set for a week that aims to shine a light on some of the issues today’s women are facing in society with the return of the OUSA Women’s Week.</p>
<p>“This year marks the 120th anniversary of women’s suffrage in New Zealand, a move that we as New Zealanders are proud of and celebrate.” Said Stevie Jepson, OUSA Welfare Committee member, “The 2013 OUSA Women’s Week will continue that celebration, as well as take a deeper look into the challenges that we still face.”</p>
<p>The week includes highlights such as; a debate on the Babe of the Day Facebook pages, workshops on poverty, legal rights and polyamory; and workshops by abortion law expert, author, and journalist, Dr. Alison McCulloch, as well as Otago academics and community leaders.</p>
<p>“It’s about having a discussion and engaging with the issues that are relevant. Such as abortion law reform, gender and pay equality, and by pointing out the various ways sexism is engrained in our society.” Said Sam Allen, OUSA Women’s Representative.</p>
<p>The week-long stall in the Main Common Room will be a place for students to add words or pictures to a wall celebrating women in our community, as well as a place to make badges, find out more information, and watch the legendary Buffy television show over lunch time.</p>
<p>All events are open to all genders, to the public, and are free.</p>
