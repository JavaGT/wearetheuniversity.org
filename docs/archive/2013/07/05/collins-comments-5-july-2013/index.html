<p><strong>Collins Comments</strong><br>It’s great to be back home after a week-long <a href="http://t.co/FV069B41F9">Leadership Decision Making Programme</a> at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in the United States. It was fantastic to meet and learn alongside some very intelligent and talented leaders from around the globe.</p>
<p>The discussions reinforced the many complex factors behind the way that we make decisions as individuals and also as a collective society. As a Government we have to make sure we take all these varying factors into account when deciding what is in the public’s interest.<br>*</p>
<p>Keeping these thoughts in mind I went straight back to work on Monday with the release of an <a href="http://www.judithcollins.co.nz/index.php?/archives/407-Feedback-sought-on-alcohol-law-regulations.html">alcohol discussion document</a>. This document invites public feedback on proposed regulations that will give effect to the new alcohol laws.</p>
<p>This Government is committed to placing stricter controls on the sale, supply, and promotion of alcohol. We know families, community groups and businesses all have an interest in this issue.</p>
<p>The discussion document covers proposed regulations relating to:<br>• Local alcohol policies<br>• Licensee obligations<br>• Licensing system<br>• Defining grocery stores<br>• Qualifications needed for obtaining a manager’s certificate<br>• Evidence of age documents<br>• Infringement offences<br>• Alcohol control areas<br>• Remote sales<br>• Licensing and community trusts</p>

<p>Everyone will have a view on the ways and extent that alcohol should be controlled in our community. Many of you have raised these opinions and solutions with me as your local MP.</p>
<p>I encourage you to make a submission on these proposals so that your views are taken into account when final decisions are made about the regulatory framework for the alcohol laws.</p>
<p>Submissions can be made up to <strong>26 July 2013</strong> to <a href="mailto:alcohol@justice.govt.nz">alcohol@justice.govt.nz</a> (please include “Regulations submission” in the subject line of your email) or posted to the Ministry of Justice, Vogel Centre, DX SX10088, WELLINGTON (Attention: Chris Bourne).</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Finally, I look forward to having the Minister of Defence, Hon Dr Jonathan Coleman, in Papakura as guest speaker at a light lunch on Friday 12 July. If you are interested in attending, please contact Mrs Chris King for further details on 09 267 2574.</p>
<p><strong>Hon Judith Collins</strong><br>MP for Papakura</p>
