<p>Murder, mystery and secrets laid bare in Writers on Mondays</p>
<p>A vast astrological murder mystery and award-winning anti-memoirs of Scottish writer Janice Galloway headline the 2013 season of Writers on Mondays, an annual literary event series presented by Victoria University’s International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML).</p>
<p>Wellingtonians will get a first look at The Luminaries, the extraordinary follow-up to internationally acclaimed author Eleanor Catton’s much-praised début novel The Rehearsal.</p>
<p>Later in the series, audiences are invited inside the moving but unsentimentally rendered childhood and adolescence of Janice Galloway in This is Not About Me and All Made Up (Scottish Book of the Year, 2012), and into the dark side of Scotland that’s revealed in her short fiction.</p>
<p>The series starts on 15 July with novelist Carl Shuker—winner of the 2006 Prize in Modern Letters—whose return to New Zealand to take up the 2013 Creative New Zealand/Victoria University Writer-in-Residence position coincides with the release of his latest book, Anti Lebanon, a cross-genre political thriller and horror novel set in the Arab Spring.</p>
<p>The following week, Kate Camp unpacks the suitcase of poems she brought home from her prestigious Creative New Zealand Berlin Writers’ Residency.</p>
<p>Next, two exciting new writers—Emma Martin and Amy Head—offer their take on the art of contemporary short fiction in conversation with Emily Perkins.</p>
<p>To mark National Poetry Day, Writers on Mondays present an opportunity to hear some of the Best New Zealand Poems in the popular annual reading.</p>

<p>On 26 August, Dave Armstrong guides audiences on an expedition into the blogosphere with Wellington bloggers Danyl McLauchlan and Giovanni Tiso who have earned themselves hordes of online followers with their respective blogs, The Dim-Post and Bat, Bean, Beam.</p>
<p>In September the series looks to the New Zealand literature of the future with a tour of début poetry collections by three diverse new-generation poets—Ashleigh Young, Therese Lloyd and Amy Brown.</p>
<p>Damien Wilkins, Director of IIML, says, “The wonderful combination of new voices and established writers makes this series a brilliant fixture on the literary calendar.”</p>
<p>Writers on Mondays events run from 12.15–1.15pm at The Marae, Level 4, Te Papa, except for: Short Sharp Script 1 &amp; 2: Circa Theatre, Mon 23 and 30 September, 12.15–1.15pm</p>

<p>12.15–1.15 pm, The Marae, Level 4, Te Papa, except for:</p>
<p>· Short Sharp Script 1&amp;2—Circa Theatre</p>
<p>15 July The Method Actor: Carl Shuker</p>
<p>‘Brash and fearless’, is how the New York Times described Carl Shuker’s first novel, The Method Actors, which won him the 2006 Prize in Modern Letters. His latest novel, Anti Lebanon, has just been published in the United States, where Publishers Weekly reviewed it as ‘a haunting and riveting account of war, loss, and exile’. Shuker is this year’s Creative NZ/ Victoria University Writing Fellow. Chair: Damien Wilkins.</p>
<p>22 July Snow White’s Coffin: Kate Camp</p>
<p>May saw the release of Kate Camp’s fifth poetry collection, Snow White’s Coffin. Written during her spell as the 2011 Creative New Zealand Berlin resident, the book renews the spooky and measured lyricism we have come to love in her poems. The recipient of the 2011 New Zealand Post Book Award joins chair Jane Stafford to discuss what gets charmed and what gets buried in the work at hand.</p>
<p>29 July Two Tough Girls: Emma Martin and Amy Head</p>
<p>‘A short story is a love affair, a novel is a marriage’, writes author Lorrie Moore, a short story is a photograph; a novel is a film. We welcome Emma Martin and Amy Head to discuss these important distinctions and share from their eagerly-awaited debut story collections, Two Girls in a Boat and Tough. Hear what these exciting new writers think about the craft of contemporary short story-writing and the perils and delights of a first publication. Chair: Emily Perkins.</p>
<p>5 August The Luminaries: Eleanor Catton</p>
<p>Internationally acclaimed author Eleanor Catton discusses her second, much-anticipated novel, The Luminaries. Set in Hokitika during the gold rush of 1866, and described as an ‘astrological murder mystery’, the book draws immediate comparisons to the vast and macroscopic novels of the 19th century. In conversation with Fergus Barrowman, Catton will describe the origins, mysteries and fates that led to this extraordinary new work.</p>
<p>12 August Best New Zealand Poems 2012</p>
<p>In honour of National Poetry Day on 16 August, Chris Price introduces a taster of the poets whose work was chosen by last year’s editor, Ian Wedde, for the online anthology Best New Zealand Poems 2012. Featuring Sarah Jane Barnett, James Brown, Zarah Butcher-McGunnigle, Geoff Cochrane, Siobhan Harvey, Helen Heath, Gregory O’Brien, Harry Ricketts and Ashleigh Young.</p>

<p>Scottish writer Janice Galloway is celebrated for her work across many forms, including short stories, novels, prose poetry, collaborations with visual artists and opera libretti. Most recently her ‘anti-memoirs’, This is Not About Me and All Made Up, have won wide acclaim, including Scottish Book of the Year. Her writing is valued for its ‘lethal accuracy’, lyricism and compassion. A special opportunity to hear this engaging author read from and discuss her work with Emily Perkins.</p>
<p>26 August Writing the Unspeakable: Danyl McLauchlan and Giovanni Tiso</p>
<p>In the age of the blog, how is the written word received, rated, and disseminated? Does worldwide and instantaneous access to writing put new pressures on the writer? Danyl McLauchlan and Giovanni Tiso have earned themselves hordes of online followers with their respective blogs, The Dim-Post and Bat, Bean, Beam and now McLauchlan has moved into the world of print with his novel Unspeakable Secrets of the Aro Valley. Join chair, Dave Armstrong, to hear them talk the tech, speak the unspeakable and more.</p>

Last year saw the release of Therese Lloyd’s Other Animals and Ashleigh Young’s Magnificent Moon, two stunning debuts.
