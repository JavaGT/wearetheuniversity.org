<p><strong>UC welcomes Ministerial appointments</strong></p>
<p>July 26, 2013</p>
<p>University of Canterbury Chancellor Dr John Wood has welcomed the announcement of four Ministerial appointments to the University of Canterbury Council.</p>
<p>“It’s a supportive mix blending current high-performing appointees with new appointments who bring both additional financial expertise and a strong link to our friends and colleagues at Lincoln University,” Dr Wood said.</p>
<p>The two reappointments are of current Pro-Chancellor, Ms Sue McCormack, a lawyer specialising in property matters with Mortlock McCormack Law, and Ms Catherine Drayton, a chartered accountant with extensive experience in audit and risk matters at management and governance levels.</p>
<p>Mr Bruce Gemmell, managing partner of Ernst and Young’s Christchurch practice, has been appointed to both the University of Canterbury and Lincoln University councils bringing broad expertise from the financial advice sector to the Council tables.</p>
<p>The fourth appointee is Mr Tony Hall, currently Pro-Chancellor of Lincoln University. His appointment to the Canterbury Council will be reciprocated with the appointment of Dr Wood to the Lincoln Council.</p>
<p>“The Minister’s approach of a common appointment and cross appointments to the two Councils is a very positive initiative which offers complementary skill sets to us and Lincoln, our closest neighbours and our oldest friends in the New Zealand university sector, Dr Wood said. “It will help us to build on the close collaboration that already exists between the two institutions.”</p>
