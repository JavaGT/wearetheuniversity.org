<p>Green economy in the spotlight</p>
<p>Does the ‘green economy’ stand up under scrutiny?</p>
<p>This question will be explored in an upcoming public lecture hosted by Victoria University—The Green Economy: Mythical or Meaningful?—by Sir Frank Holmes Visiting Fellow Professor Daniel Fiorino who will consider the green economy from the perspective of its advocates and its critics.</p>
<p>Professor Fioriono says the effects of a growing population combined with ever-increasing standards of living will, at some point, push the limits of global ecosystems, even if more sustainable measures are undertaken. His lecture will address the reasons for this and what can be done about it.</p>
<p>“Clearly, all nations must redesign policies and institutions to meet human needs in less ecologically stressful ways, although the political hurdles are formidable,” he says.</p>
<p>Professor Fiorino will present lectures and take part in several events while based at Victoria University from 29 July–9 August.</p>
<p>The Sir Frank Holmes Visiting Fellowship in Policy Studies was established at Victoria University last year by the family of influential economist, the late Sir Frank Holmes, to facilitate debate and generate advice on important contemporary public policy issues in New Zealand.</p>
<p>What: Public lecture by Professor Daniel Fiorino, American University, The Green Economy: Mythical or Meaningful?</p>
<p>When: Tuesday 6 August, 5.45pm reception followed by the lecture at 6.30pm</p>
<p>Where: Soundings Theatre, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Cable Street, Wellington</p>
<p>Cost: Free<br>ends</p>
