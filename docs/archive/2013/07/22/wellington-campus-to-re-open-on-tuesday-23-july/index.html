<p><strong>Wellington Campus to Re-Open On Tuesday, 23 July</strong></p>
<p>The Massey University Wellington Campus will re-open tomorrow (Tuesday, 23 July) after assessments have identified just superficial damage to buildings following the earthquakes yesterday. .</p>
<p>The Campus was closed today (Monday) in order that a comprehensive assessment of University buildings and facilities could be undertaken.</p>
<p>Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Robert Anderson says the all clear has been given for all students and staff to return to the Campus tomorrow. “If circumstances were to change over the course of the rest of today, further information/announcements will be posted on the Massey website and Facebook page.” Professor Anderson says staff or students can also call the University Contact Centre 0800 Massey 627 739.</p>
<p>The Albany and Manawatū Campuses have remained open. Professor Anderson says the impact on the Manawatū Campus has been minor. In Wellington a welfare centre was set up yesterday on the ground floor of The Cube residential hall, on the corner of Taranaki and Webb Streets, to offer assistance and support to students.</p>
<p>Further updates will be posted on the University’s website <a href="http://www.massey.ac.nz">www.massey.ac.nz</a> and Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/masseyuniversity">https://www.facebook.com/masseyuniversity</a></p>
<p><strong>Frequently asked questions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Are all Massey University campuses closed?</strong></p>
<p>No, the Wellington Campus is the only campus that is closed for Monday 22 July. The Manawatū and Albany Campuses are open. This closure is purely precautionary as we assess all of our buildings following the recent earthquakes. We have had specialist staff on site working building-by-building. This assessment is now complete and the Campus will be opened from 0830 Tuesday morning 23 July. If circumstances change we will provide updates via our website and our Facebook page <a href="http://www.massey.ac.nz">www.massey.ac.nz</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/masseyuniversity">https://www.facebook.com/masseyuniversity</a></p>

<p>Lecturers will be asked to reschedule lectures and tutorials, as appropriate, to minimise the disadvantage to our students.</p>

<p>All buildings have been thoroughly checked and cleared for entry.</p>
<p><strong>Is The Cube Residential Hall safe?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, an inspection of The Cube has been carried out by University staff and only superficial damage to the building was found. A further inspection on the seismic joints of the building will be carried out by a structural engineer as an additional precaution. The Cube was built after the 2004 building codes were introduced and the building meets the requirements of that code.</p>
