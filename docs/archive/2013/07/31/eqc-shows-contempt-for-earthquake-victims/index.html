<p>Clayton Cosgrove<br>Earthquake Commission Spokesperson</p>

<p><strong>EQC shows contempt for earthquake victims</strong></p>
<p>A community group, who advocate for earthquake victims, has again been stonewalled by petty and stupid Government obstruction, Labour’s Earthquake Commission spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove says.</p>
<p>“I took on the case of the Wider Earthquake Communities Action Network of Canterbury (WECAN) a fortnight ago after the group was told by the Earthquake Commission that it would accept its OIA request but it wanted $24,000 to process it.</p>
<p>“I took that OIA request over and resubmitted it in my name so the community group wouldn’t be charged. Today I get <a href="http://img.scoop.co.nz/media/pdfs/1307/Letter_from_EQC.pdf">a letter from EQC</a> stating that they are extending the timeframe to September 9 to ‘make a determination and prepare a response’ to my request.</p>
<p>“So EQC want more time to determine whether they will accept my OIA request, the same OIA it had already accepted when WECAN lodged it.</p>
<p>“Gerry Brownlee ought to kick some backsides in EQC and stop this petty obstruction. However, the Minister is culpable because he knew about this – all OIAs from MPs are run through the Minister’s office.</p>
<p>“This is ridiculous. It is showing contempt for earthquake victims and a community group trying to help them.</p>
<p>“I will be laying a complaint with the ombudsman.”</p>
