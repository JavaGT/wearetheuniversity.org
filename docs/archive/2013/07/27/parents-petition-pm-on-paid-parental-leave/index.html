<p>Parents petition PM on paid parental leave</p>
<p>Supporters of Labour’s plan to extend paid parental leave are petitioning John Key in the hope that his next policy U-turn will be to renege on his threat to veto the bill.</p>
<p>“I have accepted 2000 postcards asking John Key reconsider his opposition to extending paid parental leave to allow babies and families the support they need in the first few months,” Labour MP and sponsor of the Bill Sue Moroney said.</p>
<p>&quot;John Key has already received at least 3000 e-postcards protesting against the veto and now thousands more are on the way.</p>
<p>“Like its initial dismissal of the breakfast in schools scheme National simply doesn’t want to admit that this is a good, cost effective idea that the taxpayer can afford.</p>
<p>“National’s threat of financial veto was a knee-jerk, undemocratic response to a social policy that is affordable and popular with New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“National is developing a habit of running roughshod over democratic process, and Kiwis are voicing their concerns with John Key directly.</p>
<p>“Suggesting the bill is unaffordable and irresponsible is a feeble political tactic. Open debate and accurate costings flushed out in the select committee process, will make it obvious that extending paid parental leave is in New Zealand’s best interests.</p>
<p>“The taxpayer deserves value for money and there is a strong business case for this Bill. I look forward to debating the facts at the second reading in September,” Sue Moroney said.</p>
