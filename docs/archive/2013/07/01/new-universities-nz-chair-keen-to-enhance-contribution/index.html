<p>New Universities New Zealand Chair keen to enhance universities’ contribution</p>
<p>1 July 2013</p>
<p>Professor Roy Crawford, Vice-Chancellor at the University of Waikato, has been appointed Chair of Universities New Zealand – Te Pōkai Tara.</p>
<p>Universities NZ represents and advocates on behalf of the country’s eight universities to promote the interests of students, staff and the higher education sector.</p>
<p>Professor Crawford says that as Vice-Chancellor at Waikato for the past eight years he has been tremendously impressed at how closely the universities work together.</p>
<p>As Chair he will be focussed on promoting a stronger working relationship with the government to enhance the contribution of universities to New Zealand’s economic and social development.</p>
<p>“The universities collectively are a very important national asset, but to a large extent they are under-utilised in New Zealand. Universities can make a major contribution to the national economy</p>
<p>by developing a well-educated workforce, undertaking research in a broad range of areas, providing informed, evidence-based input towards policies and strategies, and providing an independent</p>
<p>forum for discussing important national and international issues.”</p>
<p>He will also aim to promote stronger research collaboration between the universities, crown research institutes and other research organisations to address complex, multidisciplinary issues facing modern societies.</p>
<p>Professor Crawford is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering and previously held the senior Pro-Vice-Chancellor position at Queen’s University in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where he had special responsibility for research and development.</p>
<p>He has a BsC, PhD and DSc from Queen’s University and has published eight books and over 300 papers. He has also served on numerous government panels and research grant committees.</p>
<p>Professor Crawford takes over from Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh, who will serve as Deputy Chair until the end of 2013.</p>
