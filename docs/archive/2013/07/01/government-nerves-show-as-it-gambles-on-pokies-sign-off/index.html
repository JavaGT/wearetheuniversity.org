<p><strong>Government nerves show as it gambles on pokies sign-off</strong></p>
<p>Another delay in signing the pokies for convention centre contract reveals Government nervousness about drafting a legally and morally dodgy deal, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>“Huge legal concerns expressed by several experts about this dirty deal will have sent the Government scrambling for legal cover,” said Green Party gambling spokesperson Denise Roche.</p>
<p>“It is no surprise lawyers for both parties have yet to settle on the terms of a deal when Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce has conceded the Bill of Rights was not even considered when drafting the heads of agreement.</p>
<p>“The Bill of Rights and the rule of law is the basis of our constitution. This is about there being one law for us all, and us all being equal before it.</p>
<p>“But the National Government wants to take the unprecedented step of making one law for one set of people – its mates at the casino. Legal experts such as Auckland University Emeritus Professor Jim Evans have said that is against the spirit of our constitution.</p>
<p>“Transparency International, the global corruption watchdog, has criticised the fact the convention centre will be “paid for by gamblers and their families” which it says means the deal lacks the accountability and transparency required of a Government procurement.</p>
<p>“The pokies for convention centre deal is an international embarrassment and will be a national tragedy if it&#39;s allowed to go ahead.</p>
<p>“If the contract is ever signed, there will still be time for either Peter Dunne or Act’s John Banks to use their single vote to do something for the good of the people and vote down the law changes needed to seal this dirty deal.</p>
<p>“One vote is all it will take,” Ms Roche said.</p>
