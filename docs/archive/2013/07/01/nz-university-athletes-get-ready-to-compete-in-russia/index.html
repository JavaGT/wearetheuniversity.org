<p>NZ university athletes get ready to compete in Russia</p>
<p>A team of 37 athletes are set to represent New Zealand at the 27th World University Summer Games commencing in Kazan, Russia, from this Saturday 6 July and running through to Wednesday 17 July.</p>
<p>Competitors in the New Zealand team will be pursuing medals in aquatics, athletics, gymnastics, rowing, sambo (martial art), table tennis and weightlifting (see the breakdown below).</p>
<p>The athletes are accompanied by a support crew of 20 people, under the leadership of Pete Wardell as Chef De Mission.</p>
<p>The Games – also known as the Universiade – are held every two years. This year’s Games in Kazan are being billed as “the first high-profile multi-sport event in the history of modern Russia” and are predicted to attract 13,500 participants (up from 7,844 at the 2005 event).</p>
