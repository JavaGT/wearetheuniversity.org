<p><strong>Get Back to Basics Minister</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First says the latest Year 8 National Standards data on math and writing achievements reinforces that the close to 20 million dollars spent to date has been an exercise in data gathering rather than improving learning outcomes for our kids.</p>
<p>Information released to Radio New Zealand under the Official Information Act shows that a third of students enter secondary school without reaching writing and maths standards.</p>
<p>“If this data is to be believed then the fact that these same students reach 15 years of age and are then topping the PISA testing data internationally can mean only one of three things” says Education spokesperson Tracey Martin. </p>
<p>“Either the National Standards data is flawed, the PISA testing is flawed, or our secondary schools are performing miracles in the first three years of attendance by these students.</p>
<p>“Minister Parata recently sponsored one of the creators of the PISA tests to visit New Zealand so I would be surprised if she believed PISA is flawed.  And while I think very highly of our secondary schools New Zealand First is once again reinforcing its policy that the obviously flawed National Standards need to be scrapped.</p>
<p>“It’s time the Government went back to basics by concentrating on the fundamentals of consultation and dialogue with the experts in this sector as we work for a better education for all New Zealand children,” says Ms Martin.</p>
