<p><strong>Book award winners for Victoria University Press</strong></p>
<p>Two Victoria University Press authors are the recipients of this year’s New Zealand Society of Authors (NZSA) Best First Book Awards at the New Zealand Post Book Awards announced today.</p>
<p>Poet Helen Heath has won the NZSA Jessie Mackay Best First Book for Poetry Award with her collection <em>Graft</em>, and fiction writer Lawrence Patchett has won the NZSA Hubert Church Best First Book for Fiction Award for his short story collection <em>I Got His Blood On Me.</em></p>
<p>Victoria University Press Publisher Fergus Barrowman says: “We’re delighted that two of our first books have done so well, and congratulate both our writers on winning these prestigious awards”.</p>
<p>Ms Heath, whose collection features a number of poems about scientists and was also the first book of poetry to ever be shortlisted for the 2013 Royal Society of New Zealand Science Book Prize, says: “Considering the strength of many first poetry books this year, I&#39;m immensely humbled by the judge&#39;s decision to pick <em>Graft</em> for this award”.</p>
<p>Mr Patchett, whose collection tells stories of time-travel, frontier conflict and early Pakeha and Māori relationships, says: “It’s a great boost for me and encouragement to keep writing, I’m really thrilled about it”.</p>
<p>Both writers are graduates of the International Institute of Modern Letters at Victoria University, with Mr Patchett holding both a Master’s and Doctorate from the Institute. Ms Heath holds a Master’s and is currently enrolled in PhD study.</p>
