<p><strong>Green Party will build Auckland city rail link</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party has today launched a major campaign to get the Auckland City Rail Link built and is accusing the Government of standing in the way of transforming Auckland into a modern vibrant city.</p>
<p>“A fast, frequent and affordable rail system is a smart way of transforming Auckland into a modern vibrant city, and the Green Party wholeheartedly supports moving Auckland forward,” said Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman.</p>
<p>“Aucklanders want transport choices. Study after study has shown that the rail link is the best option for dealing with the gridlock crisis on Auckland’s motorways so that those using cars can get around easier.</p>
<p>“If only 10 percent of commuters switch from using a car to getting on a train then the motorways will be freed up. It is a smart solution that will improve productivity and travel times.</p>
<p>“Modern vibrant cities have multiple ways of getting around. We are committed to providing Auckland, our international city, with a world class rail network that provides fast and frequent trains all over the city.</p>
<p>“The National Government is locking Aucklanders into last century’s concrete jungle, permanently stuck in traffic jams. The Green Party wants to transform Auckland into a modern city with modern rail.</p>
<p>“The Government has got its transport priorities all wrong. It plans to spend billions on uneconomic gold plated motorways rather than freeing up traffic gridlock in our cities.</p>

<p>“The Greens have been advocating for a city rail link for many many years. We are proud to have played an essential role in forcing the last Government to commit to electrification of the Auckland rail network which was an essential precursor to the rail link being built.</p>
<p>“We are now proud to be standing alongside the city council, local business, commuters, unions and the overwhelming majority of Aucklanders who want to finally get the rail link built,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>The Green Party campaign, called Reconnect Auckland, aims to connect with tens of thousands of Aucklanders to build pressure on the Government in Wellington to deliver at least 60 percent of the funding of the proposed rail link. The campaign also aims to increase the public’s awareness of the benefits of the rail link</p>
<p>“There is some misunderstanding about the rail link. The rail link is not a loop around the city, but rather a way of unlocking the capacity of the rail network across the region,” said Green Party transport spokesperson Julie Anne Genter.</p>
<p>“It will allow trains to run both ways through Britomart, enabling more frequent services and faster travel times. It will allow for east and west connections and free up the possibility of rail to the airport.</p>
<p>“The business case for the rail link is overwhelming. It will create jobs, increase productivity and free up the motorways. It is a much better spend than the Government’s proposed motorway expenditure,” said Ms Genter.</p>
