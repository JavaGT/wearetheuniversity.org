<p><strong>Friday, 26 April 2013, 10:40 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Jacinda<br>ARDERN<br>Social Development Spokesperson<br>26 April 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>National Fails Financially Stressed-Out Kiwis</strong></p>
<p>A new survey showing that many Kiwis are stressed out about money and struggling to afford rising household costs like power bills proves the case for Government action to bring down prices, says Labour’s Social Development Spokesperson Jacinda Ardern</p>
<p>“Hard-working New Zealanders are feeling the pinch. They’re living from payday to payday. Budgeting services say rising power prices are piling even more pressure on them.</p>
<p>“That’s why Labour will act to bring down the average household’s annual power bill by between $230 and $330. We don’t think it is fair that electricity companies continue to make super profits while Kiwis dread the thought of opening their next power bill.</p>
<p>“John Key says people aren’t paying too much for their power. He’s determined to let the power companies continue as they are while people struggle to pay their household costs. People choose to buy shares. They can’t choose to buy electricity.</p>
<p>“Budgeting services say many New Zealanders are living on a financial cliff where an unexpected bill can push them over the edge. They’re struggling to cover basic costs let alone save for a rainy day or to buy their own home.</p>
<p>“Labour will ease the pressure on first-home buyers by building 100,000 homes at an affordable price. This policy and our power plan will create thousands of jobs and stimulate our economy.</p>
<p>“Government is about acting in the best interests of the people. It’s about using the power you have to make a real difference to people’s lives.</p>
<p>“But under National, New Zealanders aren’t getting ahead. They’re doing their bit but National isn’t backing them by doing its part too.</p>
<p>“Families are hurting. The Salvation Army says more ‘white collar’ clients are asking for food parcels. People are falling behind on their rent or debt payments.</p>
<p>“Many workers can’t earn enough to support their families. A report last year by Bryan Perry showed median household incomes have dropped and 21 per cent of children are living in poverty – up from 15 per cent in 2007.</p>
<p>“So where is National’s much-promised brighter future?” said Jacinda Ardern.</p>
