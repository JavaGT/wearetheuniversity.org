<p><strong>Friday, 26 April 2013, 4:14 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Williams MP</strong><br>Spokesperson for Veterans’ Affairs<br>26 April 2013</p>
<p><strong>Groser’s Travel Costs Should Go to RSA Veterans</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is urging the Government to make Trade Minister Tim Groser repay his exorbitant, job seeking travel costs and give the money to the RSA to help veterans gain access to health and social services.</p>
<p>Mr Groser has reportedly spent $250,000 of taxpayers’ money in three months globetrotting all over the world unsuccessfully trying to land the job of head of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>Veterans’ Affairs spokesperson Andrew Williams says it is disgraceful that the Government gave only $150,000 to the RSA this week but was prepared to let Mr Groser spend $100,000 more than this chasing a plum international job.</p>
<p>“This says a lot about this government and its priorities. It is prepared to be penny pinching on the one hand and let veterans struggle to gain access to health and social services but on the other will throw sacks of money towards a job for one of its boys.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister should tell Mr Groser to repay the money immediately and do the decent thing towards veterans who served their country and the cause of peace and democracy.</p>
<p>“Tens of thousands of New Zealanders honoured the fallen at Anzac Day services yesterday and the Government should do the right thing towards those still alive and in need of help today,” says Mr Williams.</p>
