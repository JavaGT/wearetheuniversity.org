<p><strong>Top line-up for inaugural indigenous research conference</strong></p>
<p>The University of Waikato’s Te Kotahi Research Institute will host its inaugural indigenous research conference - He Manawa Whenua - at the Claudelands Events Centre in Hamilton in June.</p>
<p>The conference will feature more than 150 individual presentations from international and local speakers involved in indigenous research.</p>
<p>Organiser Herearoha Skipper says it will prove interesting to everyone, not just academics and experts.</p>
<p>“It’s a diverse line-up that covers a wide range of areas,” she says.</p>
<p>“Anybody interested in listening to indigenous perspectives will find the conference exciting and engaging. There are all different types of presentations and everyone has got a different kaupapa.”</p>
<p>Among the international keynote speakers are Waziyatawin, a Dakota writer, teacher, and activist from the Pezihutazizi Otunwe (Yellow Medicine Village) in south-western Minnesota, Aboriginal rights activist Nala Mansell-McKenna from Tasmania, Dr Jo-Ann Archibald, Associate Dean for Indigenous Education and Director of the Native Indian Teacher Education Program at the University of British Columbia and Dr Debra Harry, a Northern Paiute woman from Nevada who is a global leader in the movement to protect the rights of Indigenous peoples to their genetic resources, indigenous knowledge.</p>
<p>New Zealand presenters include Professor Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Dr Rangi Matamua, Moana Jackson, Dayle Takitimu, Ani Mikaere and Pania Papa.</p>

<p>The conference’s international keynote speakers will spend the days leading up to the conference attending community workshops being held in Auckland, Whanganui, Whakatane and Otaki ahead of the opening pōwhiri at Tūrangawaewae Marae in Ngāruawāhia on Sunday, June 30.</p>
<p>The conference proper runs from Monday, June 30 to Wednesday, July 3 and runs on three themes: innovation, well-being and inspiration.</p>
<p>With the conference taking place at the same time as Te Wiki O Te Reo Māori (Māori Language Week) both the opening and closing presentations will be presented in te reo Māori, although there will be translators on hand.</p>
<p>Conference spaces are limited and registrations are now open.</p>
