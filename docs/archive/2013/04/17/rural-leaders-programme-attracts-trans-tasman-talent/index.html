<p><strong>Rural Leaders Programme Attracts Trans-Tasman Talent</strong></p>
<p>Lincoln University’s Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme is not only highly regarded within the New Zealand rural and agriculture sector, but its reputation extends across the Tasman, with the course accepting its first Australian participant this year.</p>
<p>The programme has welcomed Mary Johnson as the first Australian to join the course and also the youngest applicant in its 34-year history.</p>
<p>Lincoln University has recently formed a five-year partnership with the Australian Beef Industry Foundation and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ). The partnership will sponsor young Australians, like Mary, who have demonstrated a commitment to the rural industry.</p>
<p>“I found out about the programme through my line of work at Cattle Council Australia and then through the Australian Beef Industry Foundation,” says Ms. Johnson. “I did some of my own research and found that the Kellogg programme is all over the world, so I jumped at the opportunity.”</p>
<p>Lincoln University has been involved with the leaders programme since 1976, when it was launched with a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, USA. Only 20 applicants are accepted each year.</p>
<p>Ms. Johnson says despite the programme being based in New Zealand she finds Australia’s rural opportunities and challenges very similar.</p>
<p>“Australia and New Zealand – both being in the Pacific – share a lot of the same features and opportunities in terms of location and trade,” says Ms Johnson. “A lot of the challenges that apply to New Zealand are the same for Australia too, so there are quite a lot of parallels, especially in terms of our rural industries.”</p>
<p>Ms. Johnson says the programme has so far given her the opportunity to regroup and take a step back to review what she wants to achieve and future career progression.</p>
<p>“I can’t wait to jump start my career,” says Ms. Johnson. “For me, the programme is a lot about personal and professional development. The skills we learn in networking and communication are skills we can use for the rest of our lives.”</p>
<p>The programme places an emphasis on networking and communication, says Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme Academic Director, Dr. Aldwell.</p>
<p>“Former course attendees form an important alumni network that every participant is able to utilise for advice, mentorship and information. Each year, previous ‘Kelloggers’ come back to talk with current students about their experience and the opportunities that followed. ”</p>
<p>Dr. Aldwell says the programme has been designed to foster leadership within the rural sector and the wider rural community.</p>
<p>“The programme is not just for those who work specifically in rural or agriculture businesses, but also anyone who lives and works within a rural area or community,” says Dr. Aldwell. “Over the years, we’ve had a wide range of applicants – from nurses to school principals, and bankers to politicians.”</p>
<p>The Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme incorporates residential workshops, seminars and personal study over an 11-month period. The first stage is a ten-day residential induction course at Lincoln University at the beginning of the year, where participants focus on the dimensions that make a leader.</p>
<p>In the second, non-residential, phase, participants select a topic of interest and complete a research project, which is presented to their fellow Kellogg participants in phase three at Lincoln University. The course then moves to Wellington for two and a half days for attendees to study the mechanism of government and the political process. They are also able to interview chief executive officers, politicians and other industry leaders about the practical nature of their leadership styles.</p>
