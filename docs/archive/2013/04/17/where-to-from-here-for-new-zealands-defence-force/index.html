<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>17 April 2013</p>
<p><strong>Where to from here for New Zealand’s defence force?</strong></p>
<p>A symposium to be held in Wellington next month will review the role New Zealand’s defence forces have played in Afghanistan, Solomon Islands and Timor Leste and discuss their future in a new security environment.</p>
<p>Called <em>After the Missions</em>, the event, to be held on 22 May, will be co-hosted by Victoria University’s Centre for Strategic Studies and the New Zealand Institute of International Affairs.</p>
<p>Professor Robert Ayson, Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies, says the return of New Zealand’s forces from overseas deployments requires a rethink of their role.</p>
<p>“The conclusion of these commitments brings home to us that New Zealand is entering a new security period in which we should test our assumptions about the role of our defence forces and how they work with other agencies,” says Professor Ayson.</p>
<p>At the symposium, leading analysts from Australasia will consider the lessons from recent long deployments of New Zealand forces, the views of New Zealand’s friends and partners, the shape of the future security environment, and the role New Zealand’s forces might play in it.</p>
<p>Professor Ayson says these questions were discussed when New Zealand was campaigning for a seat on the United Nations Security Council and that discussion should be on-going.</p>
<p>“If New Zealand wants to remain active in international and regional security,” Professor Ayson says, “we need to be thinking about our new options.”</p>
