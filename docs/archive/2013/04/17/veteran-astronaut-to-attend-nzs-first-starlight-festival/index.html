<p><strong>Veteran Astronaut To Attend NZ’s First Starlight Festival</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>April 17, 2013</strong></p>
<p>An astronaut who has travelled almost 27 million miles in space and has orbited the earth 990 times will be the key speaker at the first New Zealand starlight festival in Tekapo later this year.</p>
<p>Recently retired United States astronaut Marsha Ivins will present at the festival which is being organised the Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve Board in partnership with the University of Canterbury (UC).</p>
<p>One of the organisers, UC astronomy professor John Hearnshaw, said Ivins was a veteran of five Shuttle missions, including one to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The October 11 to 13 event has been organised to celebrate the creation of the International Dark Sky Reserve in the Mackenzie Basin and at Aoraki/Mt Cook National Park. The Dark Sky Reserve has been approved by the International Dark Sky Association which is the international body giving accreditation for Dark Sky Reserves and Dark Sky Places world-wide.</p>
<p>``The Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve is the world’s largest such reserve, the first in the southern hemisphere and the first to be declared with gold tier status, the highest that can be accorded,’’ Professor Hearnshaw says.</p>
<p>``Its formation is recognition of the pristine skies of the Mackenzie which are essentially completely free of light pollution. UC is part of the Dark Sky Reserve, being the operator of the observatory at Mt John above Tekapo.</p>

<p>``We are seeking to promote star-gazing and astro-tourism, as well as promoting our astronomical research at Mt John University Observatory.’’</p>
<p>Professor Hearnshaw said up to 1000 people will attend the event which will showcase scientific, cultural and educational events around the themes of stars, space and the environment.</p>
<p>A competition relating to the starry night sky or the harmful effects of light pollution has also been launched for New Zealand school students. The winner will meet Ivins, be given a small astronomical telescope and be invited to visit UC’s Mt John Observatory above Tekapo.</p>
