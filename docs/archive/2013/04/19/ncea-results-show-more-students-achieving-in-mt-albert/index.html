<p>NCEA results show more students achieving in Mt Albert</p>
<p>List MP Melissa Lee welcomes the news that more kids in Mt Albert are passing NCEA Level 2 or higher. “In 2012 82 per cent of 16-year-olds achieved at least NCEA Level 2. This is 4 per cent more than passed in 2011,” Melissa Lee said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is fantastic news. I want to say congratulations to all our hard working students, and thank you to all the parents, teachers, principals, and community members that helped our kids achieve this.”</p>
<p>The final NCEA results from 2012 show that 68 per cent of 16-year-olds achieved NCEA Level 2 last year – up 2 per cent from 2011.</p>
<p>“We know the better the school education, the better the opportunities for further education, employment, higher wages, and a better living standard,” Melissa Lee said.</p>
<p>“That’s why National set a Better Public Services target of 85 per cent of all 18-year-olds having achieved NCEA Level 2 or an equivalent qualification in 2017.</p>
<p>“We set it at all 18-year-olds because we want to capture everyone, including those students who gained the qualification in another learning environment.</p>
<p>“I believe making sure all children get a good education is the most important thing our Government can do to raise living standards and create a more competitive and productive economy for all New Zealanders – one of National’s priorities this term.”<br>ends</p>
