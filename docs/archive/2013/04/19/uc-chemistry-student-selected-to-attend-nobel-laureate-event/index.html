<p><strong>UC Chemistry Student Selected To Attend Nobel Laureate Event In Germany</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>April 19, 2013</strong>  </p>
<p>University of Canterbury (UC) PhD chemistry student Sandra Atkinson has achieved a once in a lifetime opportunity to participate in the 63rd Lindau Nobel Laureate meeting to be held at Lindau in Germany from June 30.</p>
<p>Atkinson is one of 625 students from 78 countries chosen to attend. Atkinson will meet 35 Nobel Laureate winners to exchange knowledge and ideas, to share their enthusiasm for science and to establish new contacts.</p>
<p>The event will include lectures, discussion sessions, master classes and panel discussions. Among the main topics will be green chemistry and biochemical processes and structures.</p>
<p>Applicants from around the world were ranked against a list of criteria which included intellectual skills and interest in science and research.</p>
<p>``My PhD research, supervised by Dr Sarah Masters, is concerned with determining the structures of molecules that only exist for very short periods of time,’’ Atkinson says.</p>
<p>``Using all of this information, a bit like a detective, the structure and identity of the molecule in question is deduced. My research provides information for other scientists to apply within their work, understanding their chemical reactions which are crucial in so many areas of life - drug design, invention of new materials, food safety, fuels and microelectronics.’’</p>
<p>The Nobel Laureate meetings bring together the most esteemed scientists of their times with outstanding young scientists from all over the world.</p>
