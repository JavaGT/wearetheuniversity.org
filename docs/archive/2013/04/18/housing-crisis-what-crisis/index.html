<p>Housing Spokesperson</p>
<p>18 April 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Housing crisis, what crisis?</strong><br>National’s token response to the Christchurch housing crisis will be little comfort to Cantabrians facing another winter in temporary and substandard housing, says Labour’s Housing spokesperson Phil Twyford.</p>
<p>“Despite official advice that 7,400 Cantabrians are officially homeless, Housing Minister Nick Smith continues to stick to his line that Christchurch’s housing shortage is ‘a challenge but not a crisis’.</p>
<p>“Nick Smith has no answers of any substance to Christchurch housing challenges: rising rents, a shortage of rental housing, and emergency housing under stress.</p>
<p>“That’s not to mention the 80,000 homes yet to be repaired whose inhabitants will have to move out while the work is being done, or the 15-20,000 construction workers expected over the next two years. There’s also 8000 new homes needed to cope with population increase.</p>
<p>“These numbers, from the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment show that the Christchurch housing crisis will get a lot worse before it gets better.</p>
<p>“It needs a bold Government intervention to deliver both temporary and affordable housing but instead National prefers to leave it to a market that has been devastated by losing 11,000 houses to the quake.</p>
<p>“The Government’s response - to deliver <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/business/the-rebuild/8509569/40-new-homes-for-eastern-suburbs">40 houses</a> in the Eastern suburbs on top of only 83 units in the temporary villages - is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>“While the Government sits on its hands, thousands of Cantabrians are facing another winter in un-insulated sleep outs, in cars, squashed into someone else’s spare room, or paying hundreds of dollars a week to live in a caravan.</p>
<p>“This is not a case of ‘a little going a long way’. It is a sign that the Government is out of touch, and ill-equipped to deal with an escalating crisis,” Phil Twyford said.</p>
