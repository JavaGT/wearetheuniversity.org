<p><strong>Labour Leader congratulates MP on top honour</strong></p>
<p>Labour Leader David Shearer today congratulated MP Raymond Huo on his appointment as Honorary Professor at one of the top law schools in China.</p>
<p>Raymond Huo says The China University of Political Science and Law is the largest legal institute in the world. It has produced 200,000 graduates in the past 50 years and is the source of judges and top lawyers in China today.</p>
<p>He says the university has established exchange programmes with some of the top law schools in the world and is currently talking with Victoria University of Wellington about similar programmes.</p>
<p>David Shearer says the appointment is recognition of Raymond Huo’s achievements.</p>
<p>“By promoting shared arrangements between New Zealand and China in areas such as trade and education, Raymond has helped to underpin the growing relationship and mutual understanding between our two countries.</p>
<p>“He is an accomplished lawyer and MP, with a proud record of representing Chinese New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“In April last year he was awarded with a ‘Green Angel Hi-tech Award’ by clean technology firm LanzaTech and giant steel company Shougang Group, recognising his work in promoting LanzaTech in China.</p>
<p>“Raymond Huo will receive his formal Honorary Professor title when he visits China this month as part of an official New Zealand delegation,” David Shearer said.</p>
<p><em>Raymond Huo graduated from China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing in 1990 moving to New Zealand in 1994. He initially worked as a journalist at the NZ Herald and then returned to his legal profession and practiced law in Auckland. He became Labour’s first Chinese-born MP in 2008. Raymond has published seven books and a number of articles.</em></p>
