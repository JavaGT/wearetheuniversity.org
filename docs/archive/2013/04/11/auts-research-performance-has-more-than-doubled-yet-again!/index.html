<p><strong>AUT’s Research Performance Has More Than Doubled Yet Again!</strong></p>
<p>The results from the 2012 PBRF assessment show that AUT University has almost doubled the number of academic staff members who have been assessed as research active since the assessment in 2006, bringing the total to over 450.</p>
<p>Since 2003, the very first PBRF assessment, the number of AUT academics that have been assessed as research active has increased by almost 220 percent as announced today by Tertiary Education Commission (TEC). This is the second largest increase and biggest proportional increase. AUT, Auckland, and Otago Universities have had the most significant increases in the number of research active staff according to the assessment.</p>
<p>The number of AUT academics rated in the higher calibre categories of A and B is almost three times greater than in 2006. As a result indicative PBRF funding for AUT has more than doubled, an increase of 125 percent since 2006.</p>
<p>The assessments show that AUT research is performing well in many disciplines including: engineering; language, linguistics and communications; health; computing and maths; management, accounting and finance; education; and art and design.</p>
<p>AUT Vice Chancellor, Derek McCormack, says we have achieved our aim to double our PBRF research results since last round.</p>
<p>“AUT has barely begun its research journey; we still have a long way to go, but we are well underway.”</p>
<p>AUT’s increased research activity enhances the high quality of the university in other areas where it already strongly performs relative to other universities in graduate employment, successful student completion rates and widening university participation and growth in enrolments at both bachelor and postgraduate levels.</p>
<p>“Our research development is targeted to support our mission of producing knowledge and graduates that are well fitted to making strong contributions to industry, the professions, and the community,” says Derek McCormack.</p>
