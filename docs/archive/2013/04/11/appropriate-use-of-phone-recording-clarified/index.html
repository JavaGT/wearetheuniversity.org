<p>11 April 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Appropriate use of phone recording clarified</strong></p>
<p>Concerns about the appropriate use of phone recordings by government agencies were clarified by the Privacy Commissioner today, say Labour MPs Lianne Dalziel and Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders can be reassured that when a government agency or business says they are recording a phone call for quality or training purposes it cannot use that information for anything else.</p>
<p>“This is a basic principle of privacy that all New Zealanders expect.</p>
<p>“However, the inappropriate use of phone recordings has been highlighted by EQC’s response to one of its security breaches, where people felt they had not been treated seriously.</p>
<p>“In a recent case, a Canterbury woman had contacted EQC to say they had emailed information about someone else’s property claim. She said that EQC had treated it like a joke and just laughed it off.</p>
<p>“EQC then used its <a href="http://www.eqc.govt.nz/sites/public_files/Privacy-breach-fact-sheet-April-3.pdf">Privacy Breach Fact Sheet</a> as an opportunity to respond to the complaint saying; “It has also been alleged in media that EQC staff “laughed off” a privacy breach notification. EQC records call centre contact and a review of the relevant calls showed that the caller was treated respectfully,” Lianne Dalziel said.</p>

<p>Labour MP, Clayton Cosgrove, who originally raised this particular breach, said he was surprised to learn that EQC had chosen not to contact the person who had a justifiable complaint having received someone else’s information.</p>
<p>“EQC should have dealt with the claim directly. Refuting this claim in a fact sheet for general distribution is appalling. This is an inappropriate use of the information and EQC should know better,” Clayton Cosgove said.</p>
<p>“I am pleased that the Privacy Commissioner was able to clarify the proper use of phone recordings today. I hope that EQC now understand that they have just added insult to injury and created another breach of privacy,” Lianne Dalziel said</p>
