<p>Tertiary Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>11 April 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Lack Of Decent Housing Hits University Roll</strong></p>
<p>In the wake of enrolments at Canterbury university being lower than forecast, the Government’s report into housing pressures in Christchurch highlights yet another potential barrier to studying at the university, Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Megan Woods says.</p>
<p>“The report shows rental accommodation in the traditional student areas to be under real stress with a dramatic decrease in availability and a sharp rise in rent.</p>
<p>“Availability of affordable rentals - classed as houses for rent below $300 - has declined in these areas by up to 64 per cent, while overall availability of rentals has declined by as much as 45 per cent. The average cost of rent for remaining houses has spiked in these areas by between 35-39 per cent, the sharpest increase across the country.</p>
<p>“For students living in these areas, the flatting situation is dire. I’ve heard stories of overcrowded flats with students turning lounges into extra bedrooms and I’m increasingly hearing from students who are turning to food banks and hardship grants just to get by.</p>
<p>“If we are serious about the future of the university we need to look carefully at why enrolment figures are declining. There is no one single reason, but this report makes clear that a lack of suitable accommodation is one of them.</p>
<p>“We need to ensure that factors including the availability and affordability of rental housing are looked at seriously.”</p>
