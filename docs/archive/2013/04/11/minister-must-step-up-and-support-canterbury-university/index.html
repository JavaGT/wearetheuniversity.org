<p>Megan<br>WOODS<br>Tertiary Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>11 April 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Minister must step up and support Canterbury University</strong></p>
<p>The Government needs to stop contradicting itself and give a definitive answer on whether it is committed to the continuation of a broad-based and research-intensive University of Canterbury, says Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Megan Woods.</p>
<p>“The University has been clear. It needs to know by October whether the Government is going to provide the funding it needs.</p>
<p>“On the one hand we have Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce committing to the <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8535101/Canterbury-Uni-to-run-on-empty-by-next-year">October deadline</a> on the proviso that the university submits a business case on time.</p>
<p>“On the other, his colleague Bill English, in Parliament today refused, to commit to that same deadline.<br>“It is not business as usual for Canterbury University, nor is this about a nice-to-have cash injection. This is about the university’s survival.</p>
<p>“Canterbury University, its students and the wider community deserve to know where they stand.</p>
<p>“This was a well-performing institution running large surpluses before the quakes. The Government should not be playing games with its future.</p>
<p>“National’s contradictory and hands-off approach in its time of need is doing the people of Christchurch and all New Zealanders a disservice,” Megan Woods said.</p>
