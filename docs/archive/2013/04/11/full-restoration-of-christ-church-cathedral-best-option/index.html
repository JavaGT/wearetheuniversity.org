<p><strong>Denis O’Rourke MP</strong><br>Christchurch Earthquake Issues spokesperson<br>11 April 2013</p>
<p><strong>Full Restoration of Christ Church Cathedral is the Best Option</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First believes the iconic status of the earthquake-damaged Christ Church Cathedral means it should be fully restored – but at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p>Christchurch Earthquake Issues spokesperson Denis O’Rourke says the trust charged with caring for the building should be replaced under new legislation.</p>
<p>“The cathedral is an important part of Canterbury’s social fabric as well as being the region’s most important heritage building.</p>
<p>“It essentially belongs to everyone and as such any new legislation should include trustees from the wider community, not just from the Anglican Church.”</p>
<p>Mr O’Rourke says while the iconic nature of the cathedral means it should be fully- restored, that should not be carried out under an open cheque book policy.</p>
<p>“A full examination needs to be undertaken to see how the restoration can be undertaken at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p>“It should be remembered that the cathedral was originally built using significant sums of public money.</p>
<p>“Any funding plan could replicate this with funds potentially coming from Christchurch City Council, government heritage funds, public donations and sponsorships.</p>
<p>“These sorts of revenue streams would not only assist in reconstruction but are also another reason why a new Cathedral Trust must include trustees from across the community,” says Mr O’Rourke.</p>
