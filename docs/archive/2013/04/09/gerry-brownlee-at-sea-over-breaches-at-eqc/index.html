<p>Lianne<br>DALZIEL<br>Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson<br>Earthquake Commission Spokesperson<br>9 April 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Gerry Brownlee at sea over breaches at EQC</strong></p>
<p>Gerry Brownlee has no idea what is happening behind the scenes at EQC and has clearly misunderstood what has caused the massive security breaches, says Labour’s Earthquake Commission spokesperson Lianne Dalziel.</p>
<p>“Gerry Brownlee is a technophobe and it shows. He has no idea what has gone wrong at EQC and is causing more problems than he’s solving. He needs some help and fast.</p>
<p>“All communications at EQC ground to a halt at his direction – including the Commission’s Twitter account. The heavy-handed lockdown of social media is perplexing given the nature of the breaches involves pivot tables and excel spread sheets.</p>
<p>“It is difficult to for a mass security breach to occur in 140 characters. It’s unlikely Gerry Brownlee knows that though, as he didn’t even know EQC had a Twitter account.</p>
<p>“His latest edict is that EQC should send emails, but not attachments. That logic is perplexing. You can communicate a lot of information in an email, whether or not that information is contained in an attachment or in the body of the email.</p>
<p>“It is quite clear there are serious problems at EQC. They need to be fixed and fast. Gerry Brownlee doesn’t know what to do. I’ll give him some help to start with – teach the staff how to use pivot tables.</p>

<p>“Instead of sorting this out, Gerry Brownlee has blamed everyone else including the people who received the messages.</p>
<p>“I now find out EQC blocked me from their Twitter account before it was shut down. Shooting the messenger is not the answer. And shutting down communication even further is just an insult to those people who are desperate to know where they stand and what’s holding them up,” says Lianne Dalziel.</p>
