<p><strong>By Dr Michael Irwin</strong></p>
<p>To be successful learners in the 21st century boys need to be creating, inventing, problem solving and learning to take risks.</p>
<p>The common perception is that boys are rough and destructive and take too many risks –¬ they get hurt; they break things and leave a trail of mess and destruction. Statistically this is true – more boys have accidents and end up in Accident and Emergency or are disciplined for unwise or stupid decisions by school or police.</p>
<p>So, what’s to be done? Lock them inside with the latest electronic entertainment?</p>
<p>Keeping boys inside and wrapping them in cotton wool is not the answer. It’s harmful and can restrict boys’ physical, emotional, social and cognitive development and potential.</p>
<p>Most boys from an early age have greater muscle mass and strength than girls. They also have a more developed motor skills system, which allows them to kick, throw, and hit a ball a great deal further and with more skill than most girls of the same age.</p>
<p>If we want boys to be able to use their strength without hurting others they need time outside playing – running, jumping, climbing and crashing and bashing into other boys. Boys need rough and tumble play with Dads, big brothers and peers where they can test their strength in a happy, fun and supervised way. If they don’t have these opportunities to learn to develop and control their physical strength they can really hurt others. In learning to control their strength boys will gather a bruise, scrape a knee or have a cry but that is part of learning about self and life.</p>
<p>I often work with young boys aged five and six creating objects out of wood. A lot of energy and imagination go into these objects, which these young boys take great pride in. They learn to use hammers, nails, glue guns and drills. For many of them it is their first time creating with wood and tools because at home they are not allowed such tools or freedoms.</p>
<p>They need to receive hammers, nails, string, magnifying glasses, bug catchers, torches and multi-tools in their Santa sack or for their birthdays. Boys can play happily outside for hours absorbed in building, creating, discovering, learning to take risks, and letting their imaginations and sense of adventure run wild. Boys need to be given the tools to create and invent if they want to be successful learners.</p>
