<p><strong>Emeritus Professor title for Chemistry stalwart</strong></p>
<p>About 30 friends, family and former colleagues attended a ceremony at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts on 5 April to see Professor Brian Nicholson receive the title Emeritus Professor from University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford.</p>
<p>Professor Nicholson, who retired from the University’s Chemistry Department last year after 37 years, has been one of the University’s most prolific science authors and his contribution played a key role in the University’s Chemistry Department being rated the best in New Zealand in the 2003 and 2006 Performance-Based Research Fund assessments.</p>
<p>Prof Crawford praised Prof Nicholson’s outstanding contribution through having more than 285 articles published in international journals.</p>
<p>“It is probably one of the most impressive records I have dealt with in my time,” Prof Crawford says.</p>
<p>Prof Nicholson, who was always more comfortable wearing a lab coat than the tie he donned for the ceremony, says his distinguished career was not something he had planned.</p>
<p>“People talk about career paths but my career has been a series of lucky, unplanned happenings,” he says, “with being offered a position at the University of Waikato in 1975 turning out to be one of the luckiest”.</p>
<p>“But it’s been fun. I am really pleased with this award, which formalises continuing links with the University, and I will follow the progress of the Chemistry Department with interest.”</p>
