<p>Two reasons to celebrate</p>
<p>Ash Puriri is used to being in the spotlight – he’s a veteran of global cruise ship entertainment, an opera singer and songwriter – but today [Tuesday 9 April] he’s sharing centre stage with his wife Karleen as they graduate at Waikato University’s Te Kohinga Mārama marae.</p>
<p>Ash of Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāti Rongomai-wahine and Ngāti Porou is graduating with a Masters in Management Studies and Karleen, Waikato Tainui, will be conferred with a Bachelor of Electronic Commerce. There’ll be plenty of whānau there to support them this afternoon including their four children aged 11 to 16.</p>
<p>The family lived on Australia’s Gold Coast for about ten years, but returned to New Zealand to be closer to whānau. Ash already had a Graduate Diploma in Business and studied an MBA at Auckland University, but was encouraged by academic Sir Tamati Reedy to return to tertiary study. “Sir Tamati has been a mentor of mine and he’s had a long association with Waikato University and the Management School. He said I should follow in his footsteps.”</p>
<p>And not being one to side-step a challenge, Ash completed his masters and is now adviser in Māori and Enterprise Development to the dean at Waikato Management School and studying for his PhD.</p>
<p>He continued working on cruise ships while he studied for his masters. “It worked well. I could study and write in my cabin undisturbed, no phone calls, and as I was studying issues in Māori tourism, the ship provided many opportunities for me to engage with real global tourism issues.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile back in Hamilton Karleen was completing the third year of her BECom. “I used to be a photographer, I had my own business but with rapidly changing technologies, I wanted to learn more about how those technologies were influencing and changing business.”</p>
<p>She became adept at juggling study and four children. “There were plenty of late nights, but I think as an adult student I had a lot more understanding and experience about life and business and that helped my learning.”</p>
<p>Karleen made the most of the opportunities that university offered. She was part of a trio that went to Canada for an international IT student case-competition. “We were the first team from a New Zealand university to take part in the event. The experience was a real-eye opener. We do things a bit differently than the North Americans. We’re more ‘nuts and bolts’, less showy. But we learnt so much by participating.”</p>
<p>Karleen was also a keynote presenter at last year’s FOMA conference. The Federation of Māori Authorities represents over 130 Māori authorities with an estimated natural resource asset value of approximately $37 billion dollars. She spoke about e-commerce and how she sees it impacting Māori business in the next 50 years. “And I hope that’s where my future lies. I’m now looking for work, preferably in iwi development, in a business that’s wanting to move forward in the global economy.”</p>
<p>But she hasn’t dismissed further study. “I feel I’ve still got a lot more to learn. This degree has whetted my appetite for more – just not yet. The time is right for me to be working.”</p>
<p>Ash Puriri began his doctoral study this year. From his research, he plans to develop a model for sustainable Māori tourism enterprise – one that embraces Kaupapa Māori philosophy and doesn’t compromise or commodify Māori culture.</p>
<p>Right now though, it’s just about enjoying their graduation day.</p>
