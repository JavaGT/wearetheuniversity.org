<p>Reports show tick-box approach to kids’ health failing</p>
<p>The Government’s tick-box approach to health is failing our kids says Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King.</p>
<p>Two reports released within days of each other raise concerns about the Government’s efforts, or lack of, in both asthma and rheumatic fever prevention.</p>
<p>University of Canterbury PhD student Rachel Webb’s study on the links between home heating and hospital asthma admissions shows a clear correlation between school holidays and asthma admissions.</p>
<p>“When kids are at home in cold, damp and mouldy conditions their health suffers.</p>
<p>“Instead of looking for fast, flash political wins it’s time the Government required all rental properties to be insulated with affordable, non-polluting heating. That is why Labour has committed to a healthy home guarantee.</p>
<p>“The Government’s failings don’t stop with asthma prevention. The latest evaluation of its rheumatic fever prevention programme shows a lack of follow-up on kids’ throat swabs is affecting their health.</p>
<p>“The report says that even if there was adequate follow-up after swabbing, the programme is in danger of failing because it doesn&#39;t address the underlying causes of the disease such as un-insulated housing, poverty and a lack of access to health care.</p>
<p>“The Government needs to take a holistic approach to children’s health.</p>
<p>“Labour is taking the linking factors between children’s health and housing seriously. The growing inequities in our society must be addressed through policies that are linked across a range of portfolios.” Annette King said.</p>
