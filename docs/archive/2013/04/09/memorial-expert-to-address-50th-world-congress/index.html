<p><strong>Media Release</strong><br>9 April 2013<br><em>- for immediate release</em></p>
<p><strong>Lincoln University Memorial Expert To Address 50th World Congress</strong></p>
<p>Associate Professor and Head of the School of Landscape Architecture at Lincoln University Dr. Jacky Bowring will deliver a keynote address at the 50th International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) World Congress, drawing on her research on memory and landscape, including as an advisor for a memorial of the Canterbury February 22 earthquake.</p>
<p>The 2013 congress has attracted attendees from 63 IFLA member countries and will take place from 10 April until 12 April in Auckland. The international forum also marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects.</p>
<p>In her keynote address on Friday 12 April, Dr. Bowring discusses a key area of her expertise – ‘landscapes of memory’.</p>
<p>“A key issue for us as we rebuild is how to balance the head and heart – how we manage the tension between the pragmatics of rebuilding with the emotions of doing so,” says Dr. Bowring.</p>
<p>“The situation in Christchurch has extended our understanding of how important the landscape is to our sense of place. Many people have expressed their passion for our landscapes in ways they may not have otherwise done, including the importance of memory in our attachment to these places. Many of the high profile contests over the fate of heritage buildings and areas of damaged landscape show how polarised people’s beliefs can be.</p>

<p>“Remembering and resilience are closely related, as our recollections of past disasters can help prevent future damage and losses of life. Our memories also provide us with cultural resilience – a strength that comes from knowing our place and where we have come from.”</p>
<p>Dr. Bowring says the theme for this year’s international forum encourages examination of Christchurch’s post-earthquake response.</p>
<p>“The theme for this 50th IFLA World Congress will focus on knowledge sharing around the challenging issues facing our local and global environments and how we, as the landscape profession, can and should participate in the shaping and management of the future,” says Dr. Bowring.</p>
<p>“The Canterbury post-earthquake environment offers us the unique opportunity to examine how we use landscapes in the city – how we used our open spaces to set-up bases immediately after the major quakes, and also how we can design our shared landscapes to better fulfill such a purpose in the future.”</p>
<p>Dr. Bowring’s analysis of the Canterbury response will be included in a combined research project with visiting professor and fellow congress keynote speaker Dr. Paula Villagra, from Chile. The global project will examine landscapes for emergency and restoration in earthquake prone cities. Dr. Villagra will visit Christchurch following the IFLA congress, with Dr. Bowring travelling to Chile to continue the research in May.</p>
<p>The IFLA Master of Ceremonies is also a representative from the teaching faculty at Lincoln University – Professor of Landscape Architecture, Simon Swaffield.  </p>
