<p><strong>Tracey Martin MP</strong><br>Spokesperson for Education<br>5 April 2013</p>
<p><strong>Government Must Untangle Novopay Tax Web</strong>  </p>
<p>New Zealand First says the Government must send in payroll experts to individual schools to unravel what could be significant tax headaches for staff from Novopay’s continued blunders.</p>
<p>Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says with a new financial year kicking off, there’s likely to be confusion over the amount of tax teachers owe, when they have been wrongly paid.</p>
<p>“How can teachers put in accurate tax returns if it’s still not clear exactly how much they’ve earned over the past 12 months?</p>
<p>“Teaching couples with joint bank accounts have such a confusing mess between them that it’s becoming impossible to unravel.”</p>
<p>Ms Martin knows of a couple where one has been over-paid by thousands of dollars but they’ve had to put that money towards living costs because the other hasn’t been paid at all.</p>
<p>“Will Novopay have sorted out the problem in time so they can repay the debt? What are the tax implications for them?</p>
<p>“Minister Steven Joyce needs to sort out the mess by putting experts into each school cluster, enabling staff to go over their individual issues.</p>
<p>“It’s not teachers’ responsibility to make sure Novopay has done its job properly.</p>
<p>“Mr ‘Fix-it’, you’ve already had to call off the debt-collectors – do staff now have to fear the taxman?</p>
<p>“How much more pressure can this botched system put on staff?</p>
<p>“Clearly there’s no capability to manage the beast that is Novopay,” says Ms Martin.  </p>
