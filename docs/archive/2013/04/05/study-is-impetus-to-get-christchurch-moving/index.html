<p>Megan<br>WOODS<br>Associate Transport (Christchurch) Spokesperson<br>5 April 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Study is impetus to get Christchurch moving</strong></p>
<p>Research that ranks Christchurch as the 5th most congested city in Australasia shows how important it is to get our transport infrastructure right, says Labour’s Associate Transport spokesperson for Christchurch, Megan Woods.</p>
<p>“The findings of <a href="http://static.stuff.co.nz/files/TrafficCongestion.pdf">the TomTom study</a> aren’t surprising. I’ve heard the same concerns about congestion and traffic issues from locals for the past two years.</p>
<p>“The aftermath of the earthquakes is an opportunity to rethink transport in Christchurch.</p>
<p>“Getting it right is not a nice to have, it’s critical to ensuring we have a modern, world-class city.</p>
<p>“We need to think about connected modes of transportation, prioritising active transport and ensuring adequate provisions are in place to connect the inner-city with the suburbs.</p>
<p>“It was encouraging to hear the council’s <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8508885/Push-for-cycleways-gains-momentum">new guidelines</a> for the design of cycling facilities and I think the results of this study prove the Council is right to be bold.</p>
<p>“People in Christchurch have been patient since the earthquakes, but no one can expect them to wait a couple of decades for transport to be sorted out.</p>
<p>“The Government and Council cannot become complacent. Both must show the people of Christchurch that they are willing to get Canterbury’s transport moving,” Megan Woods said.</p>
