<p><strong>Wednesday, 10 April 2013, 1:00 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Celebration is in order for Lincoln University graduands</strong></p>
<p>On Friday 12 April another group of well-rounded and passionate graduands will receive their qualifications from New Zealand’s specialist land-based university, Lincoln University.</p>
<p>Five-hundred and sixty-seven (567) new degree, diploma and certificate holders will receive their Lincoln University qualification, either in person or <em>in absentia</em> at graduation. Held over two ceremonies, 230 will receive their qualification in person, in the morning and 232 will receive their qualification in person, in the afternoon, at the Lincoln Event Centre.</p>
<p>Forty-two doctorates will be awarded, an increase of seven from 2012, in areas such as insect biological control, Māori management, molecular genetics, plant science and finance.</p>
<p>Lincoln University has held graduation at the Lincoln Event Centre since the 2011 earthquake. Doing so means graduands walk in procession from outside the iconic Ivey Hall (Library) at the University, through Lincoln township to the Lincoln Event Centre – a symbolic leaving behind of the University as they graduate.</p>
<p>Starting at 10.15am, the morning ceremony is for the Faculty of Commerce and during that ceremony an honorary Doctor of Commerce will be awarded to John Palmer. An alumnus of Lincoln University, graduating in 1968 with a Bachelor of Agricultural Science, majoring in Farm Management and Economics, Mr. Palmer is a leader in business and governance, with major contributions in a wide range of industries, including kiwifruit, airline, energy and banking.</p>

<p>The afternoon ceremony, starting at 2.15pm, is for the Faculty of Environment, Society and Design and the Faculty of Agriculture and Life Sciences. During that ceremony, Dr. Terence Heiler will be awarded the Lincoln University Bledisloe Medal. Dr. Heiler is an international consultant in natural resources, specialising in water management and irrigation. He is a doctoral graduate and former long-serving staff member of Lincoln University and was chief executive of a number of the University’s associated commercial entities.</p>
<p>For Lincoln University, ‘land-based’ goes far beyond just the land, and acknowledges that the value-add is through sophisticated innovations across the entire value chain. Land-based encompasses how we use the land for food, recreation, commerce and so on. These graduates are now equipped to find integrated solutions for issues currently facing land-based industries. Using the knowledge and skill set they have acquired during their time at Lincoln University, they are able to make a significant contribution to the New Zealand economy and further afield.</p>
