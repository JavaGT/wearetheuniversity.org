<p><strong>The Auction: A Comic Chamber Opera In One Act</strong></p>
<p>The University of Waikato Conservatorium of Music presents the world premiere of <em>The Auction</em>, a one-act comic opera by composer Janet Jennings, as part of the A Semester Opera Showcase concert.</p>
<p>A PhD graduate of the Conservatorium, Jennings wrote both the libretto as well as the music.</p>
<p>“The opera takes a look at what having (or trying to get) a ‘home’ means to New Zealanders. The auction becomes a crucible in which nine characters are forced to consider how they manage their lives,” says Jennings.</p>
<p>The opera is staged as an on-site auction (mortgagee sale) of a two-bedroom flat in run-down suburb.</p>
<p>Familiar hazards such as the auction process itself, mortgagee sales, pushy real estate agents, leaky buildings, and “property sharks” are all part of the action.</p>
<p>Senior vocal lecturer David Griffiths describes the piece as a delightful excursion into the world of personal and social conflict with some hilarious, unpredictable outcomes.</p>
<p>Janet is directing the production, with Francis Cowan and David Griffiths accompanying on piano.</p>
<p>Janet’s work is familiar to Hamilton concert goers. Her arrangement of Poi E was recently sung and played at Sunset Symphony by the Hamilton Festival Choir and Waikato Symphony Orchestra.</p>
<p>One of Janet’s choral works, Matariki, was recently performed by the Hamilton Civic Choir under conductor Rachael Griffiths-Hughes, and will feature on the choir’s 2013 CD.</p>
<p>The Auction will be performed as part of the Conservatorium of Music Opera Showcase, Friday 12th April 7pm, at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts, University of Waikato.</p>
