<p><strong>Inaugural Donor for Cross-cultural Research Centre</strong></p>
<p>Wellington, 4 April 2013 - The Centre for Applied Cross-cultural Research, part of Victoria University of Wellington, is delighted to announce that Dr Chan-Hoong Leong of the National University of Singapore has become its inaugural Alumni Donor.</p>
<p>Established in 2004, the Centre for Cross-Cultural Research responds to the challenges of globalisation, migration and growing cultural diversity through sound theory and research.</p>
<p>Chan-Hoong says the Centre offers an intellectually stimulating environment for conducting scholarly research on acculturation and intercultural relations. He says “There are many opportunities to interact with renowned academics in the field, while at the same time there is room for reflection and space to forge lifelong friendships and camaraderie with fellow graduate students.”</p>
<p>He goes on to say “The Centre offers is a unique learning journey that no other cultural research centre in the world could parallel. Wellington City, New Zealand’s capital and the city where CACR is located, is known to be socially and intellectually enriching.”</p>
<p>“The city is recognised for its cosmopolitan outlook, the vibrant Arts scene, its inclusive social climate and cafe culture, and its liberal, forward-thinking, and often thought-provoking perspectives on humanities and social sciences. It is a renaissance city in every sense of the word.”</p>
<p>Chan-Hoong says he was inspired to make an Alumni Donation as a way to give back to the Centre and the School of Psychology at Victoria University of Wellington. He says “I would not be where I am now without the generous support of this institution.”</p>
<p>Dr Chan-Hoong Leong graduated from Centre in 2005, and is currently a senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies, National University of Singapore.</p>
