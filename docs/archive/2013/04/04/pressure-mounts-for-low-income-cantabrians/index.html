<p><strong>Thursday, 4 April 2013, 4:48 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Phil<br>TWYFORD<br>Housing Spokesperson</p>
<p>4 April 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Pressure mounts for low-income Cantabrians</strong></p>
<p>Today’s <a href="http://www.dbh.govt.nz/UserFiles/File/Publications/Sector/pdf/christchurch-housing-report.pdf">report</a> into housing pressures in Christchurch, unsurprisingly reveals low-income Cantabrians are bearing the brunt of the city’s housing crisis says Labour’s Housing spokesperson Phil Twyford.</p>
<p>“Since the earthquakes people across Canterbury have been under a lot of pressure.</p>
<p>“Today’s report shows rising housing insecurity in the city, with thousands of Cantabrians living in inadequate or overcrowded homes. Steeply rising rents coupled with a shortage of rental properties, especially in the ‘affordable’ bracket, mean low-income families are being particularly hard hit.</p>
<p>“The report says there has been a 60% decrease in “affordable” rentals --- that is; properties rented for under $300 per week---since the earthquakes.</p>
<p>“That’s a substantial drop and one that will be keenly felt by struggling Cantabrians,” Phil Twyford said.</p>
<p>“Many families are down to a single income as a result of the earthquakes and these pressures add unnecessary strain to an already stressful situation.</p>
<p>“The report states that the decrease in available rentals was driven by the loss of two and three bedroom homes– a point that underlines the pressure on families.</p>
<p>“Competition for housing is also on the rise with former red zone residents pushing up demand.</p>

<p>“On every measure Christchurch has been under great housing stress. It is clear the Government&#39;s response to the situation has been woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>“Today’s report should be a wakeup call for the Government. Instead of dancing on the head of a pin denying there is a housing crisis, the Government needs to pull its finger out and take decisive action to deal with Christchurch’s housing problems,” Phil Twyford said.</p>
