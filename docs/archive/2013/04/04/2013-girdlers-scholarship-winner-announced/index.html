<p><strong>2013 Girdlers’ Scholarship winner announced</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>4 April 2012</strong></p>
<p>Kerry Mackereth is looking forward to “experiencing the most revered place of higher learning in the world” when she begins studying for a degree at the Faculty of Human, Social and Political Science at Cambridge University later this year. The 18-year-old former Diocesan School for Girls and current University of Auckland student, has won the 2013 Girdlers’ Scholarship to study at Cambridge’s Corpus Christi College.</p>
<p>“To attend Cambridge at such a young age is the type of experience that students like myself would usually only dream of,” says Kerry.</p>
<p>Administered by Universities New Zealand-Te Pōkai Tara, the Scholarship is funded by the Girdlers’ Company, which traces its foundation back to medieval times as a craftsmen’s guild. The award, worth £25,000 per annum, is offered to one New Zealand “all-rounder” each year.</p>
<p>“We are delighted with Kerry’s well-deserved selection,” says Peter Trimingham of the Girdlers’ Company. “In addition to her outstanding academic abilities, she has a strong sense of social justice and personal integrity.”</p>
<p>“The Girdlers take great pride in supporting this award, which is symbolic of the Company’s warm and close relationship with New Zealand since 1933.”</p>
<p>Kerry will be New Zealand’s 49th Girdlers’ Scholar.</p>
<p>During her time at Diocesan School for Girls, Kerry excelled in her studies, and was named school Dux in 2012. She was awarded a University of Auckland Scholarship for 2013.</p>

<p>Kerry takes a keen interest in world affairs and was involved in the Human Rights Council and Model United Nations conferences.</p>
<p>In future, Kerry is looking to specialise in politics and international relations to pursue a career as a diplomat or to undertake a postgraduate degree in law specialising in international or human rights law. Kerry also has aspirations to work at the United Nations, the International Court of Justice or another non-governmental organisation. She is keen to return to New Zealand one day to work in politics or foreign affairs.</p>
<p>In addition to her academic excellence, Kerry has shown great dedication to charity work, such as Habitat for Humanity, and was recognised with a ZONTA National Young Woman Award in Public Affairs in 2012 for her community involvement.</p>
<p>Kerry is passionate about music and has sung and played piano for many years, and was a member of her school’s jazz band and chamber orchestra. She has also participated in sports including swimming, hockey and fencing.</p>
