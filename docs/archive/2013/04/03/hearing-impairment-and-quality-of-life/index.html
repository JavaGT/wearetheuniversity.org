<p>Hearing Impairment and Quality of Life</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Canterbury are seeking participants for a nation-wide study examining the effects of hearing impairment on quality of life.</p>
<p>It is estimated that one in six New Zealanders experiences hearing impairment, the effects of which can be seen in many aspects of life, including emotional, social, and work-related effects.</p>
<p>Previous research from overseas has shown that perception of quality of life is influenced by many variables, including age, gender, relationship status, socioeconomic status, employment status, sexual orientation, degree of hearing impairment, and use of hearing aids.</p>
<p>To date, there has been no research examining how these variables impact on how adults in Aotearoa/New Zealand feel about their quality of life.</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to examine the perception of quality of life in adults with hearing impairment. Information from this project may help improve clinical practice and engagement in Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p>
<p>Eligibility Criteria</p>
<p>- Over 18 years of age</p>
<p>- Any degree of hearing impairment</p>
<p>- Complete and return (postage paid):</p>
<p>o Two short standardized questionnaires</p>
<p>o One information sheet</p>
<p>o The results of the hearing test</p>
<p>Both hearing aid users and non-users are welcome, as are those of any gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, relationship, employment and educational status.</p>
<p>Participants will receive a diagnostic hearing test (free of charge) at a clinic local to them, and a petrol voucher to assist with the cost of travel to the clinic.</p>
<p>This project has been approved by the University of Canterbury Human Ethics Committee. Results from this study may be published, however anonymity and confidentiality of participants is ensured.</p>
