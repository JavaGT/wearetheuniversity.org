<p>A top model, a former Olympian and a budding bionics engineer are among the students crossing the stage at Massey University’s Albany graduation this week.</p>
<p>Hosanna Horsfall, who came third in the inaugural New Zealand’s Next Top Model competition, and former Olympic swimmer Moss Burmester will both graduate on Wednesday with a Bachelor of Business Studies. Ms Horsfall’s major is in international business, while Mr Burmester’s degree is in entrepreneurship and small business.</p>
<p>The engineer behind the REX Reach robotic stroke rehab device, Wendy Xue, will graduate with a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in product design engineering on Tuesday.</p>
<p>This year more than 1,100 students, including 20 doctoral candidates, will be capped in five ceremonies across three days.</p>
<p><strong>Doctoral Graduates</strong><br>Teo Susnjak, a former professional tennis player who represented New Zealand in the Davis Cup, graduates on Tuesday with a PhD in science. It’s a crowning achievement for the Orewa resident, who didn’t finish his high school education due to his tennis commitments. His thesis on <strong>machine learning algorithms</strong> developed new strategies for the efficient processing of large data streams.</p>

<p>Nutrition lecturer Kathryn Beck tackled the issue of <strong>iron deficiency in young women.</strong> She developed a dietary assessment tool that highlighted factors to consider when identifying and treating young women with this condition. Ms Beck is also the nutrition advisor for Massey’s High Performance programme, supporting New Zealand’s future sporting stars. She wrote her thesis while working as a lecturer and raising her two children, Cameron (3) and Amy (14 months).</p>
<p>Gabrielle Beans Picón studied the <strong>evolutionary history of the Antarctic Adélie penguin</strong>, with results showing the population has repeatedly expanded and shrunk in response to Antarctic climate change.</p>
<p>Taisia Huckle researched the <strong>drinking patterns and alcohol-related harms among young people</strong> after the liberalisation of alcohol policy changes. She says more effective restrictions are needed to reduce alcohol-related harm among young people in New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>Māori and Pasifika Celebrations</strong><br>Māori and Pasifika graduates will also be honoured with ceremonies to acknowledge the special place the students have at the University. The Pasifika celebration will be held on Wednesday evening at the Sir Neil Waters Lecture Theatre and the Maori celebration will be held at the Royal New Zealand Navy Marae on Thursday.  </p>
<p><strong>New Academic Robes</strong><br>This year a new set of academic regalia will be unveiled. Designed by a team from the College of Creative Arts School of Design, the new academic regalia will be worn by the Chancellor, Pro-Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor and University Registrar at all future graduation events.</p>
<p>The deep blue garments were crafted from superfine merino wool from the Haldon Range in Marlborough. A unique fabric weave was commissioned which references New Zealand and Massey University’s identity. Each gown features the Massey University Coat of Arms, and the neckbands feature an interpretation of the Whakarare pattern (a stylised leaf pattern) embroidered on either gold or silver satin.</p>
<p><strong>Live Streaming</strong><br>Massey streams its graduation ceremonies live on the internet. Friends and family can watch the ceremonies from anywhere in the world. Following the ceremony, the videos are made available on Massey’s YouTube channel, where graduates can create a custom link to the exact moment they cross the stage and share it with others. Check out our Graduation Live website and share this link with anyone who wants to watch live.</p>
