<p><strong>Foster-Bell to Become New National MP</strong></p>
<p>Career diplomat Paul Foster-Bell is set to return from overseas next month to become the National Party’s newest parliamentarian.</p>
<p>“I have written to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade to formally advise that, if offered the vacant parliamentary seat arising from the retirement of Dr Jackie Blue MP, I would accept and resign my position with MFAT,” said Mr Foster-Bell.</p>
<p>“It has been an honour to serve our national interests offshore during my time as a diplomat. I am delighted to have been able to contribute to our country’s economic growth through enhanced business links with the affluent Gulf States,” added Mr Foster-Bell.</p>
<p>“I am looking forward to returning to Wellington to support John Key’s National-led Government, to champion our trade and economic relationships with other countries, and to serve the capital’s electors and communities,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr Foster-Bell was National’s candidate for Wellington Central in the 2011 General Election, and is the next candidate on National&#39;s list after Paul Quinn, who advised on Monday that he would decline the list place available to him.</p>
<p>Mr Foster-Bell is currently on posting with MFAT as Deputy Head of Mission at the New Zealand Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. His previous appointments include Deputy Director for the Middle East and Africa, Deputy Chief of Protocol, First Secretary and Consul at the New Zealand Embassy in Tehran, and Regional Manager within MFAT’s Security Directorate.</p>
<p>He is an archaeologist by training, has a business diploma from the University of Otago, and also studied history at Oxford.</p>
<p>He is expected to take up his parliamentary duties on 28 May.</p>
