<p>Exploring the impact of poverty on children’s learning</p>
<p>Some schools have developed new initiatives to reduce the impact of child poverty on learning, and Victoria University is bringing together experts to discuss these innovative approaches.</p>
<p>Accent Learning, a division of Viclink, will host the symposium in Wellington on 24 May 2013.</p>
<p>Topics will include the impact of child poverty on society and education, who owns the problem, multi-agency solutions, the perspectives of different groups, and proactive solutions already found by schools.</p>
<p>Geoff Todd, Managing Director of Viclink, says these subjects are topical and timely. “This event provides an opportunity for dialogue between community leaders, school leaders and other interested parties to help find solutions.”</p>
<p>Deidre Vercauteren, Viclink Education Programme Manager observes: “We too often hear of the barriers created for learning when children are hungry, or tired, or worse.”</p>
<p>Guest speakers includes Dame Iritana Tawhiwhirangi, an advocate of Māori language education and the Kōhanga Reo movement; Professor Jonathan Boston, Co-chair of the Expert Advisory Group on Solutions to Child Poverty and Director of the Institute for Governance and Policy Studies at Victoria University; and Donna Provoost and Kirsten Sharman, Principal Advisors to the Children’s Commissioner.</p>
<p>Primary school principals Kiri Smith and Eddie Uluilelata will talk about the practical steps their schools have taken including activities such as Zumba and math clubs, parents/teacher ‘cuppa and catch-up’ and students and parents involvement in the Waka Ama (outrigger canoes) competitions.</p>
