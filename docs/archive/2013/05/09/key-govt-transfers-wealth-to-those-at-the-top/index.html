<p>Key Govt transfers wealth to those at the top</p>
<p>Mighty River Power’s shares have been transferred from all New Zealanders to corporates and a small minority of already well off New Zealanders, Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman said today.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Bill English last night revealed that only 113,000 individual New Zealanders bought shares in the Mighty River Power offer with an average purchase of $8220 worth of shares. The Government claimed over 440,000 New Zealanders had pre-registered to buy shares.</p>
<p>“There aren’t too many mum and dad investors with the ability to put down $8,220 on a share portfolio,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“The latest data shows that the median household has just $1,700 in the bank. Clearly, most families don’t have thousands for a punt on the stock-market.</p>
<p>“Only the wealthiest two or three percent of New Zealanders have stumped up to buy shares in Mighty River Power.</p>
<p>“The Key Government’s privatisation of our state owned energy companies is seeing a transfer of wealth from all New Zealanders into the hands of a few.</p>
<p>“Also profiting from this failed privatisation will be the brokers and advertising agencies hired by the Government to implement their flawed policy,” Dr Norman said.</p>
<p>“Now is time for the Key Government to tell the public of New Zealand just how much this sale has cost.</p>
<p>“The public deserve to know how many tens of millions of dollars will be transferred to the brokers and advertising agencies profiting from the sale of our state owned assets.</p>

<p>“John Key’s asset sales program has always been a con.</p>
<p>“The truth is now coming out. This is a policy that transfers wealth to private investors and does nothing to assist ordinary New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“The Green Party’s NZ Power plan will lower power prices for Kiwi families and businesses.</p>
<p>“The public now have a clear choice between National, which represents the interest of a few wealthy investors, or the Greens, who offer solutions for all New Zealanders,” said Dr Norman.<br>ends</p>
