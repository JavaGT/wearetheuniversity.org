<p><strong>UC chemistry expert believes art can help deliver smart science graduates</strong></p>
<p><strong>May 29, 2013</strong></p>
<p>A University of Canterbury (UC) chemistry expert believes that art holds the future key to delivering smart science graduates.</p>
<p>Communication is a crucial skill that employers look for in graduates and UC researcher Dr Sarah Masters says UC science students have been collaborating with arts students for a special exhibition project.</p>
<p>``The ability to communicate clearly and concisely to a lay audience is a vital skill and one that is adaptable to many different employment situations.</p>
<p>``Our chemistry students have utilised this opportunity to hone their verbal communication skills and collaborate with a set of art students that they may not otherwise have interacted with in a professional capacity.</p>
<p>``Art students are also communicating in an interpretive, visual and creative manner, while the curatorial students are communicating with each other and the wider community to pull a public exhibition together,’’ Dr Masters says.</p>
<p>The public art exhibition, as a result of discussions between science and art students, will open at UC’s Ilam Campus Gallery on Thursday.</p>
<p>The exhibition, <em>Communication Is The Key To Every Healthy Relationship,</em> is the culmination of a new investigation by science students to engage in science communication.</p>
<p>The ability of science students to communicate effectively is highlighted in the Government’s recent 10 National Science Challenges.</p>
<p>In the challenges, New Zealand scientists it was said science communication, science literacy and the application of knowledge in public sector was crucial to the country’s future development.</p>
<p>The need for a greater appreciation and understanding of science was necessary for knowledge to be well diffused to the policy, private and community sectors, Dr Masters says.</p>
