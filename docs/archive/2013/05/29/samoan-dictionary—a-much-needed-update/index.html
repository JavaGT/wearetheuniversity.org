<p><strong>Samoan dictionary—a much needed update</strong></p>
<p>A Victoria University academic aims to use his newly acquired skills to create an updated Samoan language dictionary on the web, as well as a larger collection of work documenting the language.</p>
<p>In February, Galumalemana Alfred Hunkin, Senior Lecturer in Samoan Studies, Va&#39;aomanu Pasifika, was sponsored by Victoria to attend an intensive five-day workshop where he gained new skills in preparing a body of text using the web and in writing dictionary entries.</p>
<p>As a result, his collection of 300,000 words of spoken and written Samoan, collated for his Victoria University Master&#39;s degree in 2001, was loaded onto internationally renowned website Sketch Engine (<a href="http://www.sketchengine.co.uk/">http://www.sketchengine.co.uk/</a>), alongside other world languages.</p>
<p>He now plans to use this database to build a larger collection, or corpus, of one million Samoan words with the assistance of other scholars and the Sketch Engine people in England.</p>
<p>“Samoan is a threatened language, and it needs all the help it can get to survive,” says Mr Hunkin.</p>
<p>“The real possibility of producing dictionaries in this way is not only exciting, but it would be a very useful tool for learners who use the web regularly to learn languages.”</p>
<p>Mr Hunkin says dictionaries are central to learning and understanding a language.</p>
<p>“It is particularly important for Samoan to have a modern and easily accessible dictionary for people around the globe who want to learn the language, and also for translation purposes.</p>
<p>“It will also help to retain and maintain the language, outside as well as inside Samoa.”</p>
