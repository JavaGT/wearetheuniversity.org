<p><strong>Wednesday, May 29, 2013</strong><br><strong>Setting international students up for success</strong></p>
<p>International students choosing to study in New Zealand are now assured of greater support as they transition from high school to university, thanks to a new agreement between Massey University and Takapuna Grammar School.</p>
<p>The agreement, signed in a ceremony at the Albany campus, provides international students with a clear and supported pathway through a foundation year of academic studies. This will help set them up for success as they progress to tertiary study at Massey University.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says the collaboration is a sign of maturity and indicates just how far the relationship between the University and Takapuna Grammar has come.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be signing this agreement. Takapuna Grammar School has an enormous reputation that has grown over the years. This collaboration is a fantastic idea, and will help serve the North Shore area’s ambitions to become an international destination.”</p>
<p>Takapuna Grammar Board of Trustees Chair Mark McCall says the agreement is a fantastic opportunity, and the result of a lot of hard work between both organisations.</p>
<p>It’s a sentiment shared by the school’s principal, Simon Lamb: “We see Massey University as our local university, and it’s important to forge connections on the North Shore. This foundation studies programme will attract top quality international students with sustainable benefits for the area, as they transition through to tertiary study.”</p>
<p>As part of the programme, lecturers from Massey will to speak with students, and will encourage campus visits to explore study options and meet with academic staff and current students.</p>
<p>Mr Maharey says there is also potential for other schools to opt into this agreement.</p>
