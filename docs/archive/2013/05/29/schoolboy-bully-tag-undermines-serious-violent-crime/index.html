<p><strong>‘Schoolboy Bully’ Tag Undermines Serious Violent Crime<br>Press Release by ACT Party President John Boscawen<br>Wednesday, May 29 2013</strong></p>
<p>The suggestion by Victoria University Criminologist John Pratt that second striker Elijah Whaanga is nothing more than a ‘schoolyard bully’ who is being unfairly punished by the three strikes regime is absolute rubbish, ACT Party President John Boscawen said today.</p>
<p>Mr Pratt made the comments on Radio New Zealand’s Nine To Noon show today.</p>
<p>“The so-called ‘schoolyard bully’ is, in reality, a violent young man with over 72 convictions. He is exactly the type of criminal three strikes was intended to target,” Mr Boscawen said.</p>
<p>“Mr Whaanga’s first strike was for two aggravated robberies where he made threats of violence while armed and hit one victim over the head numerous times for $68 and a skateboard.</p>
<p>“His second strike and final warning was for another two aggravated robberies where once again he attacked two separate victims.</p>
<p>“Mr Pratt tries to make excuses by focusing on what Mr Whaanga took, claiming it is unfair for someone to be sentenced to a second strike for stealing a mere $68 and a skateboard. It’s not what he took, but the violence that he used to do it which is the issue.</p>
<p>“Three Strikes targets New Zealand’s worst repeat violent offenders to keep them off our streets.</p>
<p>“Mr Whaanga now has two and a half years, while he is serving his sentence, to address his problems and become a productive citizen. If he doesn’t change his ways, and commits another strike offence, he will go to jail for a very long time,” Mr Boscawen said.</p>
