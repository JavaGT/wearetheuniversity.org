<p><strong>Parata’s Budget Announcement Dodges Real Issues</strong></p>
<p>Education Minister Hekia Parata still hasn’t explained how the government is going to fill the $114 million hole left in the education budget as a result of her backdown on bigger class sizes, Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>National has announced today that it will use $80.5 million of its operating funding to support parents and communities to lift educational achievement.</p>
<p>“While I’m sure additional support for students with behavioural needs will be welcomed by schools and communities, the reality is Hekia Parata is skirting round the real issues.</p>
<p>“This is money that’s being shuffled around-- it’s not a funding increase.</p>
<p>“Hekia Parata’s decision to close special residential schools was always going to mean National would have to put money into initiatives like the Incredible Years Parent and Teacher programmes.</p>
<p>“I applaud the commitment to mental health programmes for teenagers, but if Hekia Parata is really concerned about student engagement, she should re-think her decision to axe funding for Te Kotahitanga. It has a proven track record of lifting student achievement and stopping kids from dropping out.</p>
<p>“Ms Parata’s budget announcement today gives little insight into the actual state of the books – that’s a telling sign.</p>
<p>“Instead of tinkering round the edges her time would be better spent addressing the challenges our education system faces,” Chris Hipkins said.</p>
