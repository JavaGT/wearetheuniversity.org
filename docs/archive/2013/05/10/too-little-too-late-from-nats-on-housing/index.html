<p><strong>Too little, too late from Nats on housing</strong></p>
<p>The Government’s housing accord will not solve the country’s housing affordability crisis, and is too little too late, says Labour Leader David Shearer.</p>
<p>“The Government has had almost five years to tackle housing affordability. I welcome the fact they’ve finally woken up to this issue – but National’s proposals don’t go nearly far enough.</p>
<p>“Making more land available for development is a good idea. But by itself, it won’t cut it. It won’t ensure that affordable homes are actually built.</p>
<p>“This announcement is woefully short on detail. It talks about ‘clear requirements’ for affordable housing, but is silent on how many affordable homes will be built and how much they will cost.</p>
<p>“Currently just 5 per cent of new homes built are in the affordable range. There is nothing in today’s announcement that will change that.</p>
<p>“Labour’s KiwiBuild policy is a bricks and mortar solution. Rather than sitting on the side-lines the next Labour Government will oversee the building of 10,000 affordable homes a year right across the country.</p>
<p>“Labour’s Capital Gains Tax will also help take the heat out of the housing market, by making property speculators pay their fair share.</p>
<p>“And instead of holding an inquiry into the cost of materials, as National is proposing, KiwiBuild will use the economies of scale to drive down those costs. It will be the largest public building project in 50 years, and will also create thousands of jobs and training opportunities.</p>
<p>“It’s not rocket science. There is a shortage of affordable homes in Auckland and around the country. The government I lead will roll up its sleeves and build the quality, entry level homes that the market is failing to deliver and sell them to first home buyers,” says David Shearer.</p>
