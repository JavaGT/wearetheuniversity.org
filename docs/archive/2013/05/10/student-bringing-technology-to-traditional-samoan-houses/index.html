<p><strong>Student bringing technology to traditional Samoan houses</strong></p>
<p>Using modern technology in the construction of traditional Samoan homes is the aim of research by Victoria University architecture student, Carinnya Feaunati.</p>
<p>Carinnya, who graduates with a Bachelor of Architectural Studies next week, is one of only a handful of Pacific women to earn this degree from Victoria. Although born in Wellington, she is a frequent visitor to Samoa where flooding regularly threatens homes.</p>
<p>“Our family fale (house) is on the beach and every year we have to sandbag it against floodwaters. It’s a result of temporary thinking—people want fales that are cheap to build but aren’t necessarily functional.</p>
<p>“I come from a perspective of finding ways to honour culture and traditional, while also providing a more practical housing solution. Things like raising the fale, building retaining walls, using steel and better use of concrete in construction are some of the issues I’m interested in.”</p>
<p>Carinnya, who is now studying for her Masters of Architecture, admits a “strong streak of social responsibility” runs through her.</p>
<p>“My main interests are humanitarian work, disaster relief construction and low cost housing design. I have a huge love for the Pacific and our people and hope to direct my thesis towards research into stronger infrastructure and architecture that retains and embraces cultural traditions.”</p>
<p>In 2012, she spent a month in Nepal working with Leprosy Mission New Zealand, an experience that helped foster her passion for improving the housing stock of third world countries.</p>

<p>Carinnya also recently completed a three month internship, with Fletcher Construction in New Plymouth, on the rebuild of the Taranaki Base Hospital. “That was an interesting project because I got to see things from the contractors’ perspective. Plans would change daily and the contractors had to adapt. It was useful for my work as an architect.”</p>
<p>Her dream job would be to work for the UN Humanitarian Development sector but, until then, she is busy mentoring young Māori and Pacific architecture and design students as part of Victoria’s Te Rōpū Āwhina programme, supporting the Pasifika Students’ Council and singing in the University’s Pasifika ensemble choir.</p>
<p>Carinnya believes she wouldn’t have progressed so far without the support of her family, church and wider community.</p>
<p>“It’s one of the reasons I want to focus on Pacific housing issues for my thesis, to give something back to my community.”</p>
<p>Carinnya graduates with a on Bachelor of Architectural Studies on Tuesday 14 May at 6pm.</p>
