<p><strong>Student fares a regional issue</strong></p>
<p>This week over 200 students’ crowded Victoria University of Wellington’s new Hub building to share their stories on the cost of public transport in Wellington, and called on the Greater Wellington Regional Council to extend the student discount to university and polytechnic students.</p>
<p>Students who use public transport to commute to and from university from Kapiti, Featherston, Lyall Bay, Wainuiomata and Upper Hutt shared their stories and experiences with Regional Councillors Paul Bruce, Prue Lamason, and Peter Glensor at Victoria University Students’ Association’s (VUWSA) Fairer Fares Forum.</p>
<p>VUWSA President Rory McCourt said that the Forum gave Councillors the opportunity to hear about real challenges faced by local students on a daily basis, and discuss possible solutions. Many students said it was unfair that high school students, an overwhelming majority of whom lived at home supported by their parents, received a discount while university and polytechnic students faced high rents and power bills, yet paid full fares on buses and trains.</p>
<p>Pacific student Sela Vea said each day she pays $11 per day for public transport from Newlands, while Sam Kearns doles out $8 to get to Vic from Lyall Bay.</p>
<p>Stevie Hancox-Monk spoke about how she spends $111 per week commuting from Featherston each day, and Jennie Denston spends $300 per month from Kapiti.</p>
<p>The majority of students who spoke had to take a combination of trains and buses to reach their destination.</p>
<p>McCourt said the stories showed it was an issue for the community across the region.</p>
<p>&quot;On Wednesday we heard real stories about the struggle and hardship expensive public transport is causing for students and their families from Kapiti to Featherston through to Wainuiomata and Lyall Bay,&quot; said Mr McCourt.</p>
<p>&quot;This is about our community saying that affordable public transport for everyone is key to keeping Wellington a vibrant, thriving region. University and polytechnic students have got to be a big part of realising that vision,&quot; said Mr McCourt.</p>
<p>Responding to Prime Minister John Key&#39;s recent statement that Wellington was &#39;dying&#39;, McCourt said Mr Key&#39;s comments should be a warning to local leaders to develop a strong vision for a vibrant Wellington, backing Victoria University and its students.</p>
<p>McCourt said that while the Fairer Fares campaign already had the support of many regional councillors, and there was still time to convince more.</p>
<p>&quot;Our region could very well start dying, unless we have local leadership that builds a more vibrant Wellington,&quot; said Mr McCourt.</p>
