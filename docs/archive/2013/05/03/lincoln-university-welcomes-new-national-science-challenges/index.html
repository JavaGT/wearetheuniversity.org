<p><strong>Lincoln University welcomes the new National Science Challenges</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand’s specialist land-based university welcomes and supports the Government’s new National Science Challenges.</p>
<p>The National Science Challenges are clearly identified social, environmental and economic opportunities and difficulties that face New Zealand. The Challenges framework announced by the Government describes these opportunities and difficulties using lucid, intelligible terms accessible by the general public rather than describing them using obtuse, somewhat unintelligible scientific disciplines accessible only to specialist audiences. The choice to do this makes the National Science Challenges inclusive at all levels of society and this is of real benefit to scientists. Scientific research funding will be available within the Challenge framework.</p>
<p>“The last time scientific priorities were set this clearly and concisely was in 1995. I applaud the Government for its gumption and its foresight in doing this, and I applaud its determination to back research and development in these austere economic times” says Dr Andrew West, Vice-Chancellor of Lincoln University.</p>
<p>“The framework of National Science Challenges is grounded in the practical reality of opportunity and difficulty. This is refreshing because the National Science Challenges balance social, environmental and economic imperatives. University academics and Crown Research Institute scientists can – and will - now demonstrate their initiative and creativity by populating these National Science Challenges with high-quality, relevant and exciting scientific programmes” says Dr West.</p>
<p>Lincoln University is up for the challenge and will be a leading participant in helping populate those Challenges relevant to its three main themes of:<br>• Feeding the world<br>• Protecting the future<br>• Living well</p>
