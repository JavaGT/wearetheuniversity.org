<p>Clare Curran<br>MP South Dunedin</p>
<p>3 May 2013</p>
<p><strong>Introducing my Youth Parliamentarian</strong></p>
<p>Dunedin South Youth MP, Kate Gardner and Dunedin South MP Clare Curran will kick off Youth Week by supporting the Youthline appeal this weekend. Youth Week starts this weekend, 4th – 12 May with activities throughout the country.</p>
<p>Youthline has been supporting New Zealand youth for over forty years, offering free, non-judgmental counselling and advice. Youthline volunteers provide support and development for New Zealand young people including support on cyber bullying and issues related to drug taking.</p>
<p>Youthline volunteers last year answered almost 200,000 calls and over 350,000 texts from young people.</p>
<p>Kate Gardner was selected earlier last term from a competition where she produced a 2 minute Youtube movie on how Dunedin would be in the year 2020. She will represent Dunedin South at the Youth Parliament in July in Wellington.</p>
<p>Kate is a year 13 student at Bayfield High School and is very interested in politics. She is passionate about young people being more involved in the community and decision making and was disappointed that more young people did not try out for the Youth Parliament opportunity.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, <strong>Saturday 4 May</strong>, Kate and I will be collecting together for YouthLine, out and about around South Dunedin. <strong>12pm – 1pm outside the Warehouse</strong></p>
<p>ENDS</p>
