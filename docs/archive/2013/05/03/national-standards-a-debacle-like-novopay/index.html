<p>New Zealand First<br>Tracy Martin MP<br>Spokesperson for Education</p>
<p><strong>National Standards – a Debacle Like Novopay?</strong><br> <br>There is increasing concern National Standards results are flawed and the Government is using flawed data to make educational achievements look better than they actually are says New Zealand First.<br> <br>Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says the Ministry of Education is set to publish National Standards for reading, writing and mathematics this month and questions whether these results can be trusted.<br> <br>“Many principals are alarmed to see that last year’s adjustment to the test has caused inflated results, with students achieving far higher than expected.<br> <br>“It’s particularly noticeable in some of the lower decile schools, where I’ve been told results are 20 to 30 per cent higher than in the past.<br> <br>“This shows there’s a massive flaw in the testing, producing inflated results and wrong data.”<br> <br>Ms Martin says no one can argue with the need to have a high standard of achievement but even the Ministry has acknowledged there’s a problem.<br> <br>“How can schools trust the data? They need accurate information to target support where it’s needed the most and this can’t happen when test results don’t match reality.<br> <br>&quot;The Government will relish the chance to claim its National Standards have made a difference when voters head to the polls in 2014, but parents want to know the true picture and they’re not getting it.<br> <br>“With the National Standards publishing date fast approaching we urge the Government to stop National Standards becoming another debacle like Novopay,” says Ms Martin.<br> <br>ENDS  </p>
