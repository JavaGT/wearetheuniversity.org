<p><strong>National Science Challenges and funding boost welcomed by Universities</strong></p>
<p>2 May 2013</p>
<p>The Government’s National Science Challenges and additional funding to advance these have been welcomed by Universities New Zealand –Te Pōkai Tara, which supports a more strategic and collaborative approach to research.</p>
<p>“Research, Science and Technology are essential to our nation’s economic and social development, and the universities which are at the heart of this effort and delivering world-class research, look forward to contributing to the Challenges,” says Universities NZ Research Committee Chair Professor Stuart McCutcheon.</p>
<p>“The Challenges are in areas where the universities are already active and will build on existing collaborations, such as those between the Universities and the Crown Research Institutes (CRIs).”</p>
<p>Professor McCutcheon says our universities also have strong global links and partnerships with international researchers that will assist in addressing the Challenges. “They are constantly engaged in the international exchange of ideas, data and knowledge.”</p>
<p>“The country’s eight universities are keen to enhance collaboration, both within New Zealand and internationally. We also want to embark on developing new inter-institutional research networks to strengthen research linkages.</p>
<p>“Pooling our resources will draw on the best knowledge and research practices to advance innovation and development.”</p>
<p>Professor McCutcheon says the Centres of Research Excellence (CoREs), which usually have several universities and CRI’s as partner organisations, provide a very useful model for implementing the Challenges.</p>
<p>“The CoREs have been one of the major success stories of the New Zealand research scene in the last decade and this is in part because they are linked to universities where they have access to a wide range of researchers, as well as postgraduate students.”</p>
<p>“The universities look forward to forging even stronger connections, and working with the Government, research organisations and industry to contribute to the nation’s future prosperity and well-being.”</p>
