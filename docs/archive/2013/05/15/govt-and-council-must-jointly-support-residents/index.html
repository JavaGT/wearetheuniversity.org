<p><strong>Govt and Council must jointly support residents</strong></p>
<p>Renewed support for Christchurch’s Residential Advisory Service - which the government soft-launched a month ago - is a step forward, but is missing a crucial element, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Lianne Dalziel.</p>
<p>“The service should include advocacy as well as technical advice and support. That means better collaboration with the local council and community.</p>
<p>“Information is all many people are seeking. But others are looking for someone to advocate for them.</p>
<p>“People need someone on their side and, in some cases, that means assistance to take their insurer to court. I suspect that this is what has deterred the government from expanding the service, especially now that it has been taken to court over the residential red zone decisions.</p>
<p>“It is particularly ironic that the government made today’s announcement from the red zone. Time’s up for those residents – this service won’t help them at all.</p>
<p>“For some reason the Government seems to have failed to get the council on board, meaning the council has sought a more community-oriented initiative.</p>
<p>“The best outcome would be to connect the two ideas – the RAS offering a triage, advice and mediation option, and the council-funded community initiative providing much needed advocacy in conjunction with existing legal services like community law support.</p>
<p>“That would be a win-win. The last thing people need is for the government and the council to be haggling over what’s best for them,” Lianne Dalziel said.</p>
