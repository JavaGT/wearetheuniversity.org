<p><strong>“Too Little, Too Late” for Christchurch Home Owners</strong></p>
<p>News that the Residential Advisory Service will assist Christchurch home owners with insurance problems from tomorrow is a case of too little, too late for many of those affected says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>It has now been 27 months since the February 2011 earthquake, when most of the damage to houses occurred.</p>
<p>Spokesperson for Christchurch Earthquake Issues Denis O’Rourke says that in those months, thousands of Cantabrians have been struggling with a bewildering range of serious insurance problems.</p>
<p>“Many homeowners have had to resort to the courts in order to get action on their insurance claims.</p>
<p>“Others cannot afford the time, effort, cost and stress that is involved and have just given up.</p>
<p>“The new advisory service is welcome, but it should have been set up two years ago.</p>
<p>Mr O’Rourke recommends that the service provide a limited advocacy service where it is justified in specific cases.</p>
<p>“In addition there should be special provisions made for expanded legal aid eligibility for advice on insurance issues.</p>
<p>“The Government&#39;s delayed response to the insurance needs of Cantabrians is another headache that those affected don’t need to deal with,” says Mr O’Rourke.</p>
