<p>Annette<br>KING<br>Health Spokesperson</p>
<p>15 May 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Public paying for squeeze on DHBs</strong><br>District Health Boards could be forced into debt as they struggle to cover wage and KiwiSaver costs, Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“Since July 2012 boards have had to pay employer contributions to KiwiSaver, squeezing already tight DHB budgets.</p>
<p>“Many are not receiving enough funding to cover the basic costs of salary and wage increases plus the additional costs of KiwiSaver forced on them by the Government – let alone any other new spending.</p>
<p>“Given that Mr Ryall has told DHB chairs they have to ‘identify specific actions’ in order to ‘live within their means’, they either having to cut services, go into debt, or bill patients for services once provided at no cost.</p>
<p>“Worse, the costs of KiwiSaver increased last month, so unless Mr Ryall pulls something astonishing out of Thursday’s budget hat, we’re looking at even more DHBs hitting the wall.</p>
<p>“Ironically this is all happening at the same time Mr Ryall’s ‘Better, Sooner, More Convenient Health Care in the Community’ policy is being cemented in, with GPs being asked to pick up work previously carried out in hospitals.</p>
<p>“As Medical Association chair, Dr Paul Ockelford, said earlier today they also need funding for this.</p>
<p>“It’s time Mr Ryall was honest about his intentions. If the Minister wants people to pay for the services they receive in hospital he should spell it out.<br>“Sneaky moves to shift costs onto the community, only discovered when patients are presented with the bill, are unacceptable.</p>

<p>“If he needs an example he should talk to David McFarlane, a 75-year-old Canterbury man who is paying hundreds of dollars a month to have skin cancer lesions removed by a GP instead of having it done for free at the hospital.</p>
<p>“A National government did the same thing in the 1990s, placing cash registers in hospitals. If we are going back to the future, Mr Ryall should fess up now and quit his attempts to sugar coat the issue.”</p>
