<p><strong>Urgent Couriers Selected As Finalist In AUT Business School 2013 Excellence In Business Support Awards</strong></p>
<p>Urgent Couriers has been selected as a finalist in the 2013 AUT Business School Excellence in Business Support Awards.</p>
<p>Recognised for excellence in the Business $5m - $10m turnover category, Urgent Couriers will join other finalists across 11 categories in this years’ AUT Excellence in Business Support Awards.</p>
<p>For Dean of AUT Business School Dr Geoff Perry, being aligned with the awards provides an important opportunity to build on the Schools existing engagement with industry.</p>
<p>Dr Perry said: “The Excellence in Business Support Awards are regarded highly among industry, providing organisations the chance to benchmark their performance alongside others in their field. As a Business School, it’s important for us to celebrate the businesses that contribute to the economic development of our region, so that together, we can continue to add value to the changing world of business.”</p>
<p>The robust entry and evaluation process of the awards enables finalists to reflect on how effectively their organisation achieves business excellence in all key areas including leadership and planning, customer and market focus, provision of business support, evaluation and improvement, and business results.</p>
<p>Finalists now have until 14 June to submit their final applications. The winners will then be announced on 5 September at a black-tie gala dinner in Auckland. The AUT Business School Supreme Award will be chosen from the category winners.</p>
