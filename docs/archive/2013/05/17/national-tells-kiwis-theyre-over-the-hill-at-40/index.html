<p><strong>Friday, 17 May 2013, 3:20 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>National tells Kiwis they’re over the hill at 40</strong></p>
<p>Slashing eligibility to student allowances for over-40s is proof that the government has no commitment to supporting people wanting – or needing to – further educate themselves, says Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson, Megan Woods.</p>
<p>“This move takes opportunity away from a group of people in mid-career.</p>
<p>“There are not many people who would consider 40 to be old, let alone too old to learn new skills. They deserve the Government’s backing not abandonment.</p>
<p>“We live in an ever-evolving world, one that requires most people to retrain at some stage over their working life, and one where people are being made redundant on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>“For the government to turn its back on any New Zealanders wanting to better themselves is alarming.</p>
<p>“It is also a significant shift for the National Party. It used to encourage life-long learning. Under Steven Joyce it no longer does. </p>
<p>“His claims that students can still take out a loan is disingenuous. Many will have minimal income and part-time work is scarce.</p>
<p>“The Government is already aware of a link between a drop in post graduate numbers – deferring study because of financial pressures - and previous cuts to allowances.  This move will drive yet more students from tertiary education.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce talks about an ‘innovation-led’ economy. In doing so, he misses the point of needing a skilled workforce to achieve that.</p>
<p>“It seems that Steven Joyce’s sole goal as Minister of Tertiary Education is to dampen demand and drive people away.</p>
<p>“He sees education as a cost to be cut. Labour sees it as an investment in our future.”</p>
