<p>When David beat Goliath</p>
<p>Posted by Clare Curran on May 13th, 2013</p>
<p>In Opposition most days are a battle. Every now and then there’s a victory which makes it all worthwhile. It might be a constituent’s battle against inequality and injustice in our system. Or it might be a moment when there is a shift in industry direction which you just know will have a positive, even profound impact.</p>
<p>Last Thursday such a moment occurred. It was a David and Goliath moment for New Zealand and it’s worth celebrating.</p>
<p>In the hub-bub of the week’s emotional tributes to (our) Pakerura Horomia, the blinding spotlight on (their) Aaron Gilmore, David Shearer’s framing of the Budget as being one “for the boardroom, not the smoko room” and the introduction under urgency of two draconian and frightening pieces of spy legislation which will reverberate on our justice system and our telco industry, there was a relatively under-reported but likely momentous outcome to a three year battle to protect New Zealand’s burgeoning software industry. An outcome which will protect an important export industry for New Zealand’s economic future.</p>
<p>This is no small victory. It is, in effect, a signal to the world that New Zealand is a good place to grow a software business. And in time it may stimulate our tertiary education and training sector to wake up and realise what potential we have for significant growth in the weightless economy and in weightless exports.</p>
<p>But what a journey it has been. One which has pitted the might of the multinational software companies led by Microsoft and IBM and the bloated patent attorney sector against New Zealand’s innovators who united (90% +) to oppose what they saw as one of the biggest threats to their future.</p>
