<p>Leading UK businesswoman delivering key addresses in Christchurch</p>
<p>May 16, 2013</p>
<p>A leading businesswoman in the United Kingdom who studied at the University of Canterbury (UC) will speak at key events in Christchurch next week.</p>
<p>Katherine Corich, a finalist in the New Zealander of the Year in the UK, will be a speaker at the Inspire Canterbury event in the city and will also address staff and students at UC on Monday (May 210).</p>
<p>London-based Corich is a former winner of the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year (twice), a finalist in the UK National Business Awards and was a former Aveeno Business Woman of the Year.</p>
<p>Her company Sysdoc is a founding supporter of CEISMIC, the UC online database of earthquake photos and stories.</p>
<p>Corich says UC has always been a fantastic centre for higher learning.</p>
<p>``However, it now has the added element of being able to say that it has been through the full lifecycle from natural disaster to recovery. It is great challenge that defines cities, institutions and people. Christchurch and the university have experienced this journey and students and staff are part of a special place in history.</p>
<p>``For those students who choose UC they are ready to embrace change and to meet challenges head on. Those students care deeply about the environment, natural events and rebuilding new futures. These are characteristics that employers need and love. Students at UC are setting themselves up for positive futures.</p>

<p>``Students will grow stronger from being in the heart of the Christchurch rebuild and experience the vibrancy of an emerging identity that will be Christchurch of today, tomorrow and the future.</p>
<p>``Students realise they are part of that re-energising phase of a great city. If students are combining an education at UC with the life experiences that only Christchurch can give you, then they will be unique in a world that needs more positive change makers,’’ Corich says.</p>
<p>Her company Sysdoc has expanded services to offer business process design, training, learning by simulation, games design, change management and the design and build of online / mobile knowledge portals.</p>
<p>Its clients include Jaguar Land Rover, McLaren, Vodafone, Reed Elsevier, Fonterra, Westpac, Shell and Chevron.</p>
<p>``Industry sectors we work with include utilities, telecoms and media, retail, travel and transport, oil and gas, motor vehicle manufacturing, consumer goods supply chains, sustainability and the public sector.</p>
<p>``We deliver services to more than 70 countries and we now run the concept of a ‘pop up’ office in addition to our bricks and mortar locations. This enables us to be project ready in any location in the world within 48 hours. Being experts in process design, we have redefined and optimised how to go global using a rapid response model.’’</p>
<p>Corich is a board member of Women in Leadership (WIL) Europe and the Liverpool Mayoral Development Corporation and is a Fellow of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce.</p>
