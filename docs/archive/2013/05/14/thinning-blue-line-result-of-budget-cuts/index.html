<p>Police Spokesperson</p>
<p>14 May 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Thinning blue line result of Budget cuts</strong></p>
<p>National should take the blame for more than 200 police officers leaving the force over the last eight months, says Labour’s Police spokesperson Kris Faafoi.</p>
<p>“There are 219 fewer police officers now than there were at the end of June last year.</p>
<p>“This government talks a big game on law and order, but clearly doesn’t play one.</p>
<p>“It has failed to back frontline officers with resources and some of our top cops have walked as a result.</p>
<p>“Continued belt tightening has put our police officers under increasing pressure to do much more, with much less.</p>
<p>“Funding cutbacks have also meant the Police College in Porirua has only trained half the number of police recruits that it did in 2011.</p>
<p>“The realities of Anne Tolley’s Budget cuts are kicking in. With fewer recruits coming through and a loss of institutional knowledge, our police force is looking thin on the ground.</p>
<p>“The even sadder reality is that the Minister is unlikely to go into bat for them in this week’s Budget,” Kris Faafoi said.</p>
