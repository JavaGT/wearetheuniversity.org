<p>Immediate Release</p>
<p><strong>Unfortunate experiment to be unleashed on NZ children</strong></p>
<p>Teachers are warning against allowing New Zealand students to become part of the Government’s charter school experiment.</p>
<p>The legislation allowing for the setting up of charter schools is going through its second reading in Parliament today and looks set to pass into law next week.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa National Secretary Paul Goulter says unfortunately it appears that the Maori Party will not back away from supporting the discredited charter school legislation.</p>
<p>He says this is a very sad time for New Zealand’s quality public education system – one which has been consistently performing near the top of the OECD.</p>
<p>“Overseas evidence shows that charter schools do not benefit children’s education and do nothing to lift education system performance.</p>
<p>“Charter schools are a discredited experiment in schooling being pursued through a discredited “teapot” coalition deal.</p>
<p>“At no time has the Act party leader John Banks been able to tell us how charter schools will help to lift educational achievement for struggling students.</p>
<p>“This is because charter schools are not about providing good quality education but about how to privatise our quality public education system.</p>
<p>“This legislation is the start of a new era of allowing unqualified and unregistered people to teach New Zealand children, with only limited accountability and no need to follow the National curriculum.</p>
<p>“This, combined with privatising our public education system, is a disaster for New Zealand children.”</p>
