<p>The University of Auckland is pleased to report that that everyone was evacuated successfully and there were no injuries following the fire in the student cafe at its Epsom Campus Monday 13th May,</p>
<p>It is believed that the fire started in the kitchen, however this has not been confirmed. A full investigation is currently underway to confirm the cause. The Fire Service was called to the scene immediately and quickly had everything under control. There has been extensive damage to the cafe which may be closed for up to six months for restorative work. Meanwhile a temporary cafe will be established as a medium term measure to provide cafe services for the Faculty.</p>
<p>All classes have resumed as normal at the Campus, with some relocated from the affected campus blocks. The Sylvia Ashton-Warner Library remains closed Tuesday 14th for further air-testing, and is expected to reopen Wednesday 15th May.</p>
