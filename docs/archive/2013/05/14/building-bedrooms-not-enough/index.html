<p>Phil</p>
<p>TWYFORD</p>
<p>Housing Spokesperson</p>
<p>14 May 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Building bedrooms not enough</strong>  </p>
<p>Today’s move by the Government to act on overcrowded state houses is a drop in the bucket when hundreds of thousands of families are living in crowded private sector rentals thanks to a lack of affordable housing, says Labour’s Housing spokesperson Phil Twyford.</p>
<p>“There is a direct correlation between our unaffordable housing market and the overcrowding many of our families are forced to bear.</p>
<p>“Today’s announcement may offer families in state houses some relief, but gives those in the private rental market little hope.</p>
<p>“That is why Labour has announced KiwiBuild – a bold, bricks and mortar solution that will give Kiwis a fair go.</p>
<p>“Too many of our kids are dying from preventable diseases because of cramped conditions. That is why Labour is pushing a healthy home guarantee alongside KiwiBuild to ensure all rental properties in New Zealand are warm and dry.</p>
<p>“Only a Government-backed building programme can be sure to deliver affordable homes and reduce the pressure families’ face.</p>
<p>“Today’s announcement promises to deal with overcrowded state houses. National is going to need a more comprehensive strategy if it is to really deal with our housing woes,” Phil Twyford said.</p>
