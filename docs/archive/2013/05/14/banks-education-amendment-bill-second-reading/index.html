<p><strong>Education Amendment Bill, Second Reading<br>Speech by Associate Minister of Education John Banks<br>Tuesday, May 14 2013</strong></p>
<p>I rise to speak in favour of the second reading of the Education Amendment Bill.</p>
<p>The Bill provides the legal framework for Partnerships Schools | Kura Hourua.</p>
<p>I want to join with the Hon Hekia Parata in thanking Dr Cam Calder the Chair of the Education and Science Committee and the members of the Committee for their hard work.</p>
<p>They have improved the Bill. The first change is to require the existing independent review option to now be a mandatory term of all sponsorship contracts.</p>
<p>I can advise the House that officials are working on some default dispute resolution options that will be focused on the educational needs of the student. These will be superior to arrangements in most state schools.</p>
<p>The second change is a partial extension of the jurisdiction of the Ombudsmen to suspensions, stand-downs, exclusions and expulsions. This change both protects the students and ensures sponsors who are non-government organisations have their status preserved.</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge all those who took the time to make a submission to the Committee. Even when we disagree, I know that our education system can only improve with the passionate engagement of learners, parents and educational professionals.</p>
<p>This Bill as it relates to Partnership Schools is drawn from a proposal in the ACT and National Confidence and Supply Agreement. That proposal was given life by the Partnership Schools Working Party ably led by Catherine Isaac whose work shaped this Bill.</p>

<p>Partnership schools spring from the values of the ACT Party. In education we believe in parental choice and the funding following the child whatever the school type.</p>
<p>We know that in education, one size does not fit all.</p>
<p>In essence we believe in the transformative potential of education.</p>
<p>That is why we backed Aspire Scholarships last term and why we promoted Partnership Schools this term.</p>
<p>Every child has potential however humble their origins.</p>
<p>Every child has inherent value.</p>
<p>And every child deserves the opportunity to get a world class education.</p>
<p>No member in their heart-of-hearts can say that New Zealand is delivering on that.</p>
<p>So this Bill is important. It will determine whether this House is on the right side of history.</p>
<p>I believe we will stand with young Māori and Pasifika who deserve to discover the spark of learning.</p>
<p>We will stand with those with learning difficulties or from low socio-economic backgrounds who yearn to achieve.</p>
<p>We will stand with the dedicated educators including Māori and Pasifika educators who are able to inspire and lead and achieve for our most vulnerable learners.</p>
<p>We will stand with the proposition that greater freedom to educators should be coupled with higher levels of accountability.</p>
<p>Partnership Schools offer an important option for address the endemic problem of underachievement of our most venerable leaners.</p>
<p>The good news is that the current education system works well for the majority of our young people. Our best students are best in the world.</p>
<p>There is more good news. There have been significant recent gains for Pasifika students and slight gains for Māori.<br>The bad news is that still too many of our vulnerable students are being left behind. In terms of equity, which is the size of the gap between our highest and lowest achievers, we are among the worst of OECD countries.</p>
<p>The good news is that Partnership Schools are on the way.</p>
<p>Being a first world nation means five out of five students gaining the knowledge and skills to be successful citizens in the 21st Century.</p>
<p>This country has huge potential. However we waste that potential because of the continuing disparity that characterises our education system.</p>
<p>Partnership Schools will help target the problem of underachievement.</p>
<p>In the Partnership School model, the Crown enters into a contract with a sponsor, who operates the school.</p>
<p>Sponsors vary from school to school and could be, for example, groups of parents, not-for-profit community groups, businesses, churches, Iwi or Pasifika groups, or Trusts.</p>
<p>The term ‘partnership’ captures the essence of what these schools represent – a partnership between the Crown, the business sector and the community.</p>
<p>They will introduce more choice, and more flexibility, into our education system.</p>
<p>More choice for parents – who will have greater freedom to choose the education that best suits their children’s learning needs.</p>
<p>And more flexibility – as Partnership Schools will have greater freedom around how they operate.</p>
<p>They will be given more autonomy from the usual rules and regulations under which state schools are required to operate.</p>
<p>This includes the freedom to offer a different curriculum so long as it can be mapped against the New Zealand curriculum and its principles and qualifications framework, and adaptable operating hours.</p>
<p>They must employ teachers who are trained and qualified in their fields, but they may, in certain, limited circumstances, be teachers who are not registered with the Teachers’ Council.</p>
<p>This flexibility will allow them to do things differently. They will be allowed to use new and diverse approaches to teaching and learning, and property and school organisation.</p>
<p>They can focus on specialist areas of learning, such as art, music or sport, and they can answer a particular need in their community, such as for faith-based schooling or holistic development.<br>In exchange for this flexibility, Partnership Schools will have higher levels of accountability with a unique evaluation framework.</p>
<p>I’m pleased to advise the House that we have received 35 applications from potential sponsors for Partnership Schools.</p>
<p>They are currently being considered by the Authorisation Board, an expert panel of independent advisors.</p>
<p>The Authorisation Board will make recommendations to the Minister of Education.</p>
<p>No final decisions will be made, or contracts with potential sponsors entered into, until this Bill is passed. Contracts are expected to be in place by the middle of this year.</p>
<p>This ensures successful sponsors have enough time to prepare their schools to open in 2014.</p>
<p>Can I once again express my appreciation for the work of the Select Committee. Can I also place on record my appreciation for the support of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Education and the Maori Party for Partnership Schools.</p>
<p>Roll on day 1 term 1 2014</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
