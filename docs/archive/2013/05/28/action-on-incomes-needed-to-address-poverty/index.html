<p>Action on incomes needed to address poverty</p>
<p>The Government’s final response to recommendations made by the expert advisory group on solutions to child poverty is a cop out leaving the extensive work carried out by the Children’s Commission largely ignored, the Green Party said today</p>
<p>The Children&#39;s Commissioner&#39;s &#39;Solutions to Child Poverty&#39; report called for action to improve family incomes to ensure all New Zealand children get a good start in life and can fulfil their potential.</p>
<p>“Ironically on the same day John Key announced a Food in Schools programme, Child Poverty Action Group headed to court seeking a declaration that the in-work tax credit is unjustified discrimination against the children of beneficiaries,” said Green Party children’s spokesperson Holly Walker.</p>
<p>&quot;The in-work tax credit had lifted thousands of children out of poverty but hasn&#39;t helped the one in five children whose parents study or are on a benefit,&quot; Ms Walker said.</p>
<p>“The Government is discriminating against this group while simultaneously coming to the realisation that we have a responsibility for the children of these families to have food.</p>
<p>“The Children&#39;s Commissioner&#39;s expert report recommended a universal child payment as a key step towards ensuring all our children have the best possible start in life. The Government should listen to that recommendation.</p>
<p>&quot;We support a universal child payment as the best and fairest way to ensure that all children, not just some, have the opportunity to have a good life, and a fair, bright and prosperous future.</p>
<p>“We will also instigate a national poverty measure and implement the recommendations of the Children&#39;s Commissioner so that the right information is collected in order to be able to tackle child poverty at its source.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ve got all the evidence we need for comprehensive policy to end child poverty. What will it take to make the National Government wake up and do something to save a whole generation of children?”</p>
<p>ends</p>
