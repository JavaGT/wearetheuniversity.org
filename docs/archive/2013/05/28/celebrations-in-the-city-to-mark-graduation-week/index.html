<p><strong>Tuesday, 28 May 2013, 5:07 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University">Massey University</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, May 28, 2013</strong><br><strong>Celebrations in the city to mark graduation week</strong></p>
<p>More than 670 graduates will have degrees conferred by Massey University at two separate graduation ceremonies in Wellington on Thursday.</p>
<p>Features of the ceremonies at the Michael Fowler Centre include the awarding of the 500th Bachelor of Communication degree since the programme’s inception a decade ago, and graduation addresses by guest speakers comedian Raybon Kan and alumnus and footwear designer Kathryn Wilson.</p>
<p>Massey’s four senior officers, the Chancellor, Pro-Chancellor, Vice Chancellor and University Registrar will be bedecked in newly designed graduation gowns that embrace New Zealand’s distinctive identity while respecting traditions harking back to medieval times. The designs reference the mana and prestige of the korowai (Maori cloak) making the most of New Zealand wool, while retaining the gravitas of the old regalia.</p>
<p>The 673 graduands include National Party MP Shane Ardern who is graduating with a Graduate Diploma in Rural Studies as well as seven doctoral recipients.</p>
<p><strong>Doctoral graduates</strong></p>
<p>Noeline McIntyre investigated issues, tensions and challenges related to special education policies and practices in New Zealand through the narratives of nine families with children with special needs.</p>
<p>Jeff Simpson investigated the meaning and impact of narcissistic personality style on a group of graduates’ performance over a two-year period from the start of their corporate careers.</p>

<p>Ryan Holland Investigated why Pasifika and Maori success in sport had not translated into sport governance roles.</p>
<p>Giresh Kanji researched the cause of tension-type headaches, examining more than 600 medical papers and textbooks.</p>
<p>Brett Hunt investigated the impact anxiety, depression and cognitive factors associated with anxiety (such as worry) have on everyday risk-taking behavior.</p>
<p>Heide-Marie Strauss investigated two different screening methods used in assessing dementia in New Zealand. Results showed that the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Assessment-Revised (ACE-R) is the most suitable screen in terms of diagnostic sensitivity and meeting other clinician needs.</p>
<p><strong>Maori and Pasifika celebrations</strong></p>
<p>Māori and Pasifika graduates will also be honoured with ceremonies to acknowledge the special place the students have at the University. The Māori graduation ceremony is on Thursday at the Wellington campus marae and the Pasifika ceremony is on Friday in the Great Hall of the Museum Building.</p>
