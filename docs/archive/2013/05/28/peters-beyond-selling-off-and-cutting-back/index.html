<p><em>Beyond Selling Off and Cutting Back</em></p>
<p>To understand anything about selling off and cutting back we need to first jump back seventy years to the words of a great Hungarian thinker – Karl Polanyi.</p>
<p>In 1944 he said - &quot;To allow the market mechanism to be sole director of the fate of human beings and their natural environment...would result in the demolition of society&quot;.</p>
<p>Last century, during the times of politicians like Roger Douglas – the “market mechanism” took over.</p>
<p>And, as predicted the demolition of society started and has continued to this day.</p>
<p>In essence, the market rules our lives.</p>
<p>It is a brilliantly contrived situation created by those who stand to benefit most from it.</p>
<p>These people are the very rich – the finance industry, Wall Street, currency speculators – those at the top of the financial heap.</p>
<p>They control governments – not the other way around.</p>
<p>They are truly global thinkers. Instead of wrecking one country at a time – they can hit half the globe.</p>
<p>Look at the global financial crisis and the shocking damage to some countries like the so-called PIGS.</p>
<p>Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain – even the United States.</p>
<p>This global crisis was created in the first place by the leaders of the banking and financial system in the United States.</p>
<p>Advertisement - scroll to continue reading</p>
<p>They built a system of shonky loans and packaged them as gilt edged securities.</p>
<p>The banks went on orgies of lending to make huge profits.</p>
<p>When the loans went bad governments had to step in and bail them out.</p>
<p>Despite that global crisis the same market-led madness is the prevailing mood in the Beehive.</p>
<p>The cut back culture flows alongside the asset sales mindset.</p>
<p>The marketeers hate the thought of any of their profits going in taxes of any kind.</p>
<p>They expect the state to guard their wealth, educate their children and pave their roads.</p>
<p>But those services are for others to pay for.</p>
<p>One of the core beliefs of these marketeers is that the state has no part to play in business – and that anything and everything can be sold.</p>
<p>Meanwhile countries that have not been sucked into this market madness are doing very nicely – barely twitching.</p>
<p>Countries such as Singapore and Norway.</p>
<p>Let’s list the effects of selling off and cutting back in New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>SELLING OFF</strong></p>
<p>1. Taxpayer-owned forests sold to the United States, China and Japan. We lost the Forest Service.</p>
<p>2. The Post Office was sold – we lost ownership of our telecommunications and a big savings bank.</p>
<p>3. Telecom has ripped billions from the New Zealand economy, businesses and homes.</p>
<p>4. The sale of parts of our power generation. The results? High prices and cold people.</p>
<p>5. The government printing office – sold for a song.</p>
<p>6. The National Film Unit – sold for a song.</p>
<p>7. Fishing quotas worth billions of dollars – they were the first state assets handed out in an obscene transfer of wealth from the state to private companies.</p>
<p>8. The sale of the State Insurance Office and the result that can be seen in the faces of Christchurch homeowners trying to recover from the earthquakes.</p>
<p>9. The sale of dairy farms to United States, China and European interests.</p>
<p>10. The sale of Railways in the nineties. Asset stripped and then the state had to take it back.</p>
<p><strong>CUT BACK CULTURE</strong></p>
<p>1. Everywhere you look you see the costs that reliance on self- regulation, the ideology of the “free market” and a culture of cut backs is inflicting on New Zealand.</p>
<p>2. The tragedy of Pike River was a consequence of an under-funded and under resourced mines inspection service.</p>
<p>3. The leaky home fiasco was a consequence of the Bonfire of the Regulations in the early 1990s - and now there are also hundreds of leaky classrooms that need to be fixed.</p>
<p>4. Cut backs in the Department of Conservation are now leaving great swathes of the conservation estate and many endangered species at risk.</p>
<p>5. Our railway system is being dismantled by stealth with actions such as the closure of the Napier – Gisborne Line and the Hillside workshops in Dunedin.</p>
<p>Border protection has been compromised and mismanaged which allowed the Psa bacteria to devastate the Kiwifruit industry.</p>
<p>The Novopay debacle where a botched contract was given to an Aussie company on spurious grounds has caused endless cost and confusion to the education system.</p>
<p>Police numbers are down and morale in the Defence forces is falling as cut backs and ill-considered restructuring takes its toll.</p>
<p>And of course there is the lamentable state of Immigration NZ – where a seemingly perpetual state of poor performance appears to be Government policy.</p>
<p>The Government is full of bluster and hot air.</p>
<p>In election year National promised 170,000 extra jobs.</p>
<p>Where are they?</p>
<p>All their hopes are being pinned on putting an extra million people in Auckland in less than three decades.</p>
<p>This is madness.</p>
<p>Auckland cannot cope with its present population.</p>
<p>Roads are gridlocked.</p>
<p>The transport system is in meltdown.</p>
<p>There is a housing crisis of both availability and affordability.</p>
<p>There is huge pressure on hospitals, schools and other social infrastructure.</p>
<p>Auckland needs time to breathe and to get on top of its problems.</p>
<p>The Government’s policy to pour another million people into the City of Sails is truly dumb.</p>
<p>Most of the newcomers are coming from abroad.</p>
<p>They are buying up houses and investing in real estate.</p>
<p>The housing price bubble is growing at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>Every day we hear of another serious issue facing Auckland.</p>
<p>There is a limit to the amount of bad news the people can withstand.</p>
<p>When taxpayers in Invercargill, New Plymouth, Nelson and Napier have to pay extra taxes to finance infrastructure for another million people in Auckland, they will start feeling aggrieved.</p>
<p>Especially when local projects are ditched because of Auckland demands.</p>
<p>The fact is there are any number of politicians and commentators who will tell you how they are going to solve Auckland’s problems.</p>
<p>But if they don’t wind back the huge influx of outsiders to Auckland as part of their plans to give Auckland a chance to get on top of its problems then these politicians and commentators are talking pixie dust.</p>
<p><strong>SUPERANNUATION</strong></p>
<p>There is a serious flow on effect to New Zealand pensions.</p>
<p>In the past great numbers of immigrants have come to New Zealand to work a substantial part of their working lives, pay taxes, and contribute to New Zealand.</p>
<p>No one begrudges them getting Superannuation when they turn 65.</p>
<p>But of late New Zealand taxpayers are paying pensions to thousands of immigrants who have done little to contribute to this economy.</p>
<p>We are an offshore retirement home for many from China.</p>
<p>It stems from that country’s official policy of a married couple allowed only one child.</p>
<p>One skilled immigrant from China can come with a spouse and a child.</p>
<p>That means a man and his wife can bring both sets of parents here under the parental reunion policy.</p>
<p>So, we employ one and then get a whole extended family on the health and welfare system of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Last year the number of skilled migrants from China was matched by an equal number of people coming here under family reunion.</p>
<p>Parent migrants go straight on to our health system the day they are granted residency.</p>
<p>The biggest hits are on New Zealand Superannuation.</p>
<p>A migrant only has to be resident for 10 years, and from age 65, is entitled to FULL New Zealand Super without any requirement to work.</p>
<p>No other country in the world has a universal pension at this level of generosity.</p>
<p>You spend your lifetime struggling and you get the same pension and health entitlements as a parent from abroad who comes here at age 55 – and contributes nothing!</p>
<p>It is simply not fair and an abuse of New Zealand’s welfare and health systems.</p>
<p>Asian studies professor Manying Ip, of Auckland University, has warned that if the trend continues, it will bring new health, housing and socio-economic challenges.</p>
<p>When licensed immigration adviser Jimmy Lee says that having too many elderly Chinese migrants here “could end up a liability for the country” then it’s time some took off the blinkers and looked at what is happening.</p>
<p>Last week when we discussed the effects of a million extra people in Auckland, and pointed out the down side of this, there were predictable screams of outrage.</p>
<p>For many years we have questioned the wisdom of immigration policies that bring a highly disproportionate number of ageing people from one country because of that country’s family policy.</p>
<p>Our population, and the number of taxpayers, simply cannot sustain the cost of this.</p>
<p>New Zealand First has this quaint old fashioned idea that we should look after our own people first.</p>
<p>We emphasise that we stand up for the most vulnerable groups – the young and the old.</p>
<p>We believe that it is insane – indeed criminally insane – to allow elderly New Zealanders to be cold in their homes while we pay full pensions to people who have been here only ten years and have contributed nothing.</p>
<p>Nearly 65,000 people have come into New Zealand on the family reunion policy over the past fifteen years.</p>
<p>When all these people receive superannuation – the bill to the New Zealand taxpayers will hit a billion dollars!</p>
<p>This is the real reason that some political parties are trying to lift the retirement age while others want the pension reduced.</p>
<p><strong>NEW ZEALAND FIRST POLICY</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First has a plan to ensure that our pensions are fair and sustainable.</p>
<p>We have to look after our own people first and be fair to taxpayers.</p>
<p>Our scheme is based on the years of residence in New Zealand between the ages of 20 and 65 years.</p>
<p>Very simply, a person of 10 years residence, like the cases explained will be entitled to roughly a quarter of New Zealand Super.</p>
<p>And nothing more!</p>
<p>This is not criticising people as individuals.</p>
<p>It is simply stating the need for a sensible policy in place for those middle aged migrants coming here under the parent category.</p>
<p>Life expectancy at 65 is about another 20 years – so that’s equivalent to $350,000 from NZ Super and NZ taxpayers with no requirement to work!</p>
<p>We face an ageing population and a flood of retirees returning from abroad – the last thing we need is to add to it!</p>
<p>New Zealand First has a solution – to put in place sensible and sustainable immigration ratios and strictly apply them.</p>
<p>Of the total number of people granted permanent residence in any one year we say no less than 75 per cent should be skilled migrants.</p>
<p>Of the remaining 25 per cent we would use the following allocations for:</p>
<p>• Family reunion</p>
<p>• Parent reunion</p>
<p>• Humanitarian or refugee.</p>
<p>And we would cap parent reunion at the same percentage for all countries – so no one country has an unfair advantage as happens now.</p>
<p>This would put an end to the situation we had in 2012, where China hogged over 50 per cent of the parent category quota, disadvantaging parents from all other countries.</p>
<p><strong>OVERSEAS PENSIONS</strong></p>
<p>Now there is another problem and it covers the people who:</p>
<p>• Come to New Zealand after contributing to a pension scheme overseas.</p>
<p>• Are ex-pat Kiwis returning home</p>
<p>• ‘The Section 70s’ – who get stripped of their overseas pension and get New Zealand superannuation instead.</p>
<p>We say this is unfair.</p>
<p>Section 70 migrants and expat Kiwis who have worked overseas and bring overseas pensions home should keep them.</p>
<p>They can’t expect to receive full NZ superannuation as well but they can expect the proportion of super that their taxes have paid for while working here.</p>
<p><strong>FUTURE</strong></p>
<p>Our future lies in exporting.</p>
<p>We make some of the world’s best food.</p>
<p>We innovate and improvise.</p>
<p>Our beautiful country will always attract visitors.</p>
<p>With sensible conservation policies, the waters around us could sustain a great fishing industry.</p>
<p>We have to grow and process our raw materials ourselves.</p>
<p>We have to help our manufacturers and exporters so they in turn can provide jobs.</p>
<p>We have to be a lot smarter.</p>
<p>We cannot hang the hopes of future generations on waiting on tables while living in rented flats.</p>
<p>We have to provide a future for New Zealanders within New Zealand.</p>
<p>We can’t keep exporting our young talent.</p>
<p>We have to follow in the footsteps of the people who built this country on sound economic and social principles – not the experimentalists perpetually in pursuit of the “silver bullet”.</p>
<p>If we are to survive – we have no other choice.</p>
