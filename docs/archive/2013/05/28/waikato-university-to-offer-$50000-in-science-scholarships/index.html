<p><strong>Waikato University to offer $50,000 in science scholarships</strong></p>
<p>Ten new research scholarships valued at $5000 each are up for grabs in B Semester, from the University of Waikato’s Faculty of Science &amp; Engineering.</p>
<p>The School of Science Masters Research Scholarships are offered in specific, predetermined areas of research including volcanology, coastal systems, geothermal systems, aquatic ecology, plant ecology, plant ecophysiology, chemistry, extremophile microbiology and Antarctic microbiology.</p>
<p>Applicants should be eligible to enrol for the first time in a Master of Science in B Semester 2013 and must have an excellent academic record.</p>
<p>“These scholarships present a unique opportunity for top students to work alongside top researchers who have identified a range of interesting and novel research topics,” says Dean of Science &amp; Engineering, Professor Bruce Clarkson.</p>
<p>Microbiologist Professor Craig Cary is just one of the supervisors available for the scholarship projects. Prof Cary will offer a student the chance to work towards understanding the distribution and function of Antarctic terrestrial microbial communities. As part of a large international terrestrial Antarctic program this project will focus on examining microbial communities in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica.</p>
<p>In addition, one successful candidate will work with Dr Adrian Pittari on research looking at giant pyroclastic flows from the early Taupo Volcanic Zone and deciphering ignimbrites from the Mangakino caldera.</p>
