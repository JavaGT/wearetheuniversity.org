<p>Su’a William SIO</p>
<p>Pacific Island Affairs Spokesperson</p>
<p>20 May 2013  MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Pacific Ministry Set Up to Fail</strong></p>
<p>Budget cuts to the Ministry for Pacific Island Affairs will only increase pressure on a community already suffering high unemployment, low incomes and growing inequality says Labour’s spokesperson for Pacific Island Affairs Su’a William Sio.</p>
<p>“In this Year’s Budget National slashed $861,000 from the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs - a significant cut for a small agency tasked with lifting outcomes for our fastest growing population.</p>
<p>“It comes at a time when Pacific underachievement is at its most severe. A <a href="http://www.salvationarmy.org.nz/research-media/media-centre/local-news/pacific-peoples-making-progress/">report</a> from the Salvation Army, published today, says Pacific people have been hardest hit by the recession and without support risk being left behind when the economy picks up.</p>
<p>“Too many Pacific people are unskilled, unsupported and not reaching their potential.</p>
<p>“Pacific Island Affairs Minister, Hekia Parata, has failed to stem growing inequity and Pacific people are losing out as a result.</p>
<p>“In the lead up to the Budget, National trumpeted additional places for Maori and Pacific students in trades schools. What it delivered was a $200,000 cut to skills training and employment programmes for youth in Auckland.</p>
<p>“Hekia Parata’s $330,000 cut to community and stakeholder engagement activities will also undermine efforts in areas like education and ECE participation where significant gains have been made.</p>

<p>“Cancelling $253,000 in funding for business and skills training is short-sighted considering the Pacific community desperately needs to up-skill.</p>
<p>“Overall, the Minister’s cuts weaken the Ministry&#39;s ability to perform basic functions such as ensuring Pacific peoples’ earnings are on a par with other New Zealanders. This specific measure has been highlighted in the Salvation Army Report which reveals Pacific incomes have only increased by $2 in the last five years compared to $54 dollars for New Zealanders at large.</p>
<p>“National has denied suggestions that plans are afoot to disestablish or merge the Ministry but the nine percent funding cut in Budget 2013 suggests otherwise – the Ministry is being set up to fail,” Su’a William Sio said.</p>
