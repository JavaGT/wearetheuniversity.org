<p><strong>Quake Outcasts File Judicial Review Proceedings</strong></p>
<p>The news that forty owners of vacant land and uninsured red zone property owners have filed judicial review proceedings in the High Court today against the Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery and the Chief Executive of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority has been welcomed by New Zealand First.</p>
<p>Canterbury Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Denis O’Rourke says that the case arose because the government made offers to purchase the properties for only 50 per cent of their 2007 land value.</p>
<p>&quot;These people&#39;s rights have been trampled on, and they have been the subject of unlawful discrimination when other red zone property owners have received government offers of 100 per cent of the 2007 rating value.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister’s decision to establish red zones destroyed the market value of these properties which gives rise to full and fair compensation.</p>
<p>“Legal action is the proper course when the Minister has rebuffed all attempts to get a review of his decision.</p>
<p>&quot;It is high time that the Government offered the full 2007 land value made to other red zone property owners. It should not be necessary for people to sue the Government to get fair treatment&quot;, says Mr O’Rourke.</p>
