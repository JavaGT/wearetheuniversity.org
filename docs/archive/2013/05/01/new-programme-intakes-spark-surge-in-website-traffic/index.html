<p><strong>New programme intakes spark surge in website traffic</strong></p>
<p>Social media traffic to Massey University’s International Students website has increased 500 per cent since the announcement of a new Spring enrolment “window” aimed at prospective students from Europe, North America, Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>The programmes are open to all students, including those from New Zealand, and because they start in August, September and November, are particularly attractive to northern hemisphere students who complete their studies in the middle of the calendar year.</p>
<p>While it is too soon for any additional enrolments to be confirmed, staff from Massey’s International Office are delighted with the increase in visits to its Facebook page, which has surged from just over 2000 “likes” in the middle of April to more than 12,500 at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Academic and International) Professor Ingrid Day says the new intake provides students with the opportunity to study in New Zealand soon after receiving their final exam results.</p>
<p>“Traditionally, the start of the second semester wasn’t suitable for some international students to begin their studies at Massey as they hadn’t received their high school results,” Professor Day says. “We have taken this on board and are now able to offer a new intake in August and September, allowing these students to commence studies here in New Zealand without having to wait until semester one the following year.</p>
<p>“We have specifically targeted interest from prospective international students and we are seeing good results from our campaigns.”</p>

<p>Students commence their study in an initially accelerated programme, moving straight into their second year in February of the following year, effectively shaving time off their overall programme duration.</p>
<p>The new intakes offer degree programmes at Massey’s Auckland (Albany) campus.</p>
<p>• Bachelor of Engineering and Bachelor of Food Technology<br>• Postgraduate Diploma in Business and Administration (Marketing)<br>• Master of Professional Accountancy and Finance<br>• Master of Management (Marketing)<br>• Postgraduate Diploma in Business and Administration (Management)<br>• Master of Management (Management).</p>
<p>A suite of pre-degree programmes is also being offered at all three of Massey’s campuses to supplement the new intake.</p>
<p>The university’s approach to its internationalisation programme has also been recognised by rankings issued by the QS World University Rating Agency, which show that Massey was awarded a five-star rating for internationalisation.</p>
