<p><strong>Friday, 24 May 2013, 2:44 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Arrangements for the Selection Process for the Labour Candidate in Ikaroa-Rawhiti</strong></p>
<p>The selection process will take place this weekend with three hui, in the Hutt Valley, Tolaga Bay and Taradale. All hui will be open to all Labour members, including the 700+ paid-up Party members in the Ikaroa-Rawhiti Electorate, and qualifying members of Labour’s affiliates. The formal sessions of the hui are closed to media. Party Leader David Shearer and a number of other Labour MPs will also be present at the Taradale hui.</p>
<p>At each hui the six candidates – Hayden Hape, Molly Keelan-Pare, Henare O’Keefe, Tamati Olsen, Shane Taurima and Meka Whaitiri – will speak for up to 10 minutes, and answer questions from Party members. Members will then indicate their candidate preference (in order); those votes will be counted at the final hui in Taradale. Also at that Taradale meeting we will start with the election of a floor delegate to be on the Panel, joining three representatives of New Zealand Council (Moira Coatsworth, Soraya Peke-Mason and Rudy Taylor) and one from the Labour Electorate Committee. The result of the candidate preference vote also counts as one vote on the Panel, making a total of six.</p>
<p>The hui locations are as follows:<br><strong>Friday 24th May 7pm – Kokiri Marae, 7-9 Barnes Street, Seaview, Lower Hutt<br>Saturday 25th May 2pm – Hauiti Marae, Hauiti Road, Tolaga Bay, East Coast<br>Sunday 26th May 10am – St Joseph’s Maori Girls College, 25 Osier Road, Taradale, Napier</strong></p>
<p>The Panel is scheduled to start its’ deliberation around 1.30pm on Sunday at the selection venue, and a result is expected late that afternoon. The Party President and the successful candidate will do a media stand-up outside the venue shortly after that.</p>
