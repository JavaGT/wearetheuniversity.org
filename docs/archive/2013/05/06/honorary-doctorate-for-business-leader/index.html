<p><strong>Honorary Doctorate for business leader</strong></p>
<p>One of New Zealand’s most accomplished investment bankers, Rob Cameron, will be awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Commerce during Victoria University’s May graduation.</p>
<p>Mr Cameron is a Victoria alumnus who, during a distinguished career, has influenced national economic policies and advised on some of New Zealand’s largest commercial transactions.</p>
<p>Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says Mr Cameron’s drive to succeed in his chosen field epitomises the attributes the University seeks to instil in graduates.</p>
<p>“Rob has pursued his career with energy, passion and determination and he has made significant and influential contributions to both the public and private sectors in New Zealand, as well as being a positive influence in the growth and governance of Victoria University.”</p>
<p>After graduating from Victoria University with a Bachelor of Commerce and Administration with First Class Honours in the 1970s, Mr Cameron received a prestigious Harkness Fellowship to complete postgraduate studies at Harvard University.</p>
<p>On his return to New Zealand, Mr Cameron worked at the Treasury as a Section Head in the Economics Division and was a principal architect in the development of the state owned enterprise model during the early 1980s.</p>
<p>He went on to hold senior positions at Jarden &amp; Company and Fay Richwhite &amp; Company, before establishing Cameron Partners Limited in 1995, a business which has become one of New Zealand’s foremost investment banks.</p>

<p>Mr Cameron has received numerous accolades for his economic and financial expertise, including being made a Fellow of the Institute of Financial Professionals New Zealand. He recently chaired the Capital Markets Development Taskforce, which made recommendations that have led to major policy changes in areas affecting New Zealand’s capital markets.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Mr Cameron has supported not-for-profit organisations including serving as a member of the Board of Trustees of Special Olympics New Zealand. He currently sits on the board of KEA, which encourages expatriate New Zealanders, and friends of New Zealand, to increase their contribution to the country.</p>
<p>Mr Cameron has also supported Victoria University for many years, through roles such as Advisory Board membership for Victoria Business School and Board Chair of the Institute for the Study of Competition and Regulation. He was a member of the University Council between 1998 and 2001 and received a Hunter Fellowship in 2003, in recognition of his ongoing and valuable contributions.</p>
<p>Mr Cameron will receive his honorary degree during the Victoria University graduation ceremony for Victoria Business School which takes place on Tuesday 14 May at 1.30pm.</p>
