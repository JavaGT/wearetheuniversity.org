Each institute is offering a doctoral scholarship worth $22,000 a year plus fees for three years’ full time study, and a masters scholarship worth $12,000 that includes a fees component of $3,500.</p>
<p>“Our Research Institutes all support major research platforms that have been successful in winning contestable research funding, and so this is an exciting time for postgraduate research at Waikato University,” says Pro Vice-Chancellor Postgraduate Professor Kay Weaver. “This gives 12 students a fantastic opportunity to work with some of Waikato’s best researchers on relevant and topical issues.”</p>
