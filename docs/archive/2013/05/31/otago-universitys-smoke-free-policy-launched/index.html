<p><strong>Otago University’s smoke-free policy launched</strong></p>
<p>The University of Otago will become fully smoke-free from 1 January, 2014.  The University’s revised smoke-free policy, launched officially today, applies to all campuses and recognises strong support from staff and students for a smoke-free setting. </p>
<p>Announcing the move, Vice-Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne said the University’s smoke-free policy will enhance the outstanding environment offered to staff and students who work and study at Otago.</p>
<p>The University’s Smoke-free Campus Implementation group expects many benefits to follow the new policy’s introduction.  International evidence suggests litter problems reduce, disputes due to second-hand smoke exposure decline, and staff and students enjoy better health.</p>
<p>Professor Norman Sharpe, Medical Director of the Heart Foundation, applauded the University’s decision.  “Creating smoke-free environments brings many health benefits and gives tangible support to the more than eighty percent of smokers who regret having started smoking, and who wish to quit.”</p>
<p>Staff and students who smoke may access support via on-campus Quit advisors, as well as existing health and safety services.  The University is supporting domestic staff and students who smoke and who wish to become smoke-free by subsidising the dispensing fee charged when smokers redeem Quit cards for nicotine replacement treatments.</p>
<p>Professor Hayne says Otago is unique among New Zealand universities in the support it is offering to assist staff and students who smoke and who wish to quit.</p>
<p>“We know many smokers find quitting a challenge and we want to offer the best support we can to those who want to become smoke-free,” Professor Hayne says.</p>
<p>Dr Jan Pearson, Health Promotion Manager at the Cancer Society, commended the approach taken. “It is very encouraging to see the support that is being provided to smokers; the University of Otago has set a new benchmark that we hope other large employers will follow.”</p>
<p>Details on accessing support can be obtained through the University’s Smoke-free website: <a href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/smokefree">http://www.otago.ac.nz/smokefree</a></p>
