<p><strong>Lincoln University’s rural leaders programme a family tradition</strong></p>
<p>For the Luxton family, completing Lincoln University’s Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme has become something of a family tradition. Not only was former Minister of Agriculture John Luxton one of the very first participants of the course in New Zealand, several other family members have also gone on to do the course, including his daughter Nicola, and current course attendee, Richard.</p>
<p>Highly regarded internationally, Lincoln University’s Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme is helping to shape the future of agribusiness and rural affairs in New Zealand. The course is designed for people who have proven their commitment to rural New Zealand and have shown eagerness to take on leadership roles. Only 20 applicants are accepted each year, with applications now open for aspiring leaders to complete the course in 2014.</p>
<p>Lincoln University has been involved with the leaders programme since 1976, when it was launched with a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, USA. The yearlong programme will next year celebrate its thirtieth intake of students in New Zealand.</p>
<p>John Luxton completed the course in its inaugural year in 1979, and currently holds the role of Chairman at dairy industry organisation, DairyNZ. Mr. Luxton says he holds the Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme in high regard, referring to it as a “trailblazer” course. </p>
<p>“The Kellogg programme was the first time the wider sector got together to focus on leadership,” says Mr. Luxton. “It’s not just for people from across the primary sector, but also outside it as well. It’s about future rural leaders coming together and giving perspective on the agriculture industry.”</p>

<p>Mr. Luxton says anyone who works and lives in rural New Zealand will benefit from the programme’s core features – developing solid leadership skills, building confidence, learning about the forces that impact New Zealand agribusiness, and establishing networks.</p>
<p>“I think the programme is useful for most walks of life, not just the rural sector,” says Mr. Luxton. “Many people in different roles in the rural community would see the course as being useful in their own industries as well.</p>
<p>“I had a 25-year reunion with my fellow Kelloggers and many have gone on to hold various leadership and governance roles on producer Boards, local and central government, and meat and dairy companies. Others have taken on leadership roles in the education, health and banking sectors.”</p>
<p>Mr. Luxton remains involved in the course, returning to speak to new attendees and offer advice. DairyNZ is a key sponsor of the programme, as well as Beef + Lamb New Zealand, Deer Industry New Zealand, Pipfruit New Zealand, and Zespri International.</p>
<p>Nicola Luxton completed the programme in 2003. Nicola has a double degree in law and geography, as well as a Masters in Resource, Environmental and Planning. After practicing law for a period, she now oversees a dairy, sheep and beef farm in South Taranaki.</p>
<p>Nicola says she valued the opportunity to experience the broader industries within the rural sector. “I did the course the year we went farming,” says Nicola. “It was a great way to start my new farming career and gave me a solid grounding. The programme not only introduced me to the wider rural sector, but also allowed me to form networks with current and future leaders.”</p>
<p>Richard Luxton is partway through this year’s programme. Richard owns a share milking business in Waikato and was previously a Corporate Farm Supervisor for MyFarm, managing several farms in the Canterbury region. Having studied governance last year, Richard was looking for ways to progress his career and thought it was an ideal time to receive the most benefit from the course.</p>
<p>“The Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme really stands out – if you look at the agriculture industry, a lot of high profile leaders are Kellogg alumni,” says Richard. “It’s well regarded and, upon completion of the course, you definitely get noticed.”</p>
<p>As well as furthering his own skill-base, Richard is excited about other opportunities that will arise from the programme. “Meeting other people and being inspired by their success is something to look forward to,” says Richard. “The network channels will hopefully open new doors as I progress through my career.”</p>
<p>The Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme incorporates residential workshops, seminars and personal study over an 11-month period. The first stage is a ten-day residential induction course at Lincoln University at the beginning of the year, where participants focus on the dimensions that make a leader.</p>
<p>In the second, non-residential phase, participants select a topic of interest and complete a research project, which is presented to their fellow Kellogg participants in phase three at Lincoln University. The course then moves to Wellington for two and a half days for attendees to study the mechanism of government and the political process. They are also able to interview chief executive officers, politicians and other industry leaders about the practical nature of their leadership styles.</p>
