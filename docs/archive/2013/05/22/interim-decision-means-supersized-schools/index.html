<p><strong>Interim Decision Means Supersized Schools</strong></p>
<p>The Government needs to take note of the concerns of Christchurch parents who do not want their schools supersized, Green Party associate education spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said today.</p>
<p>Education Minister Hekia Parata this afternoon announced that four Christchurch schools will close to form a super-school. Aranui High School, Aranui Primary, Wainoni and Avondale will be closed to form one facility catering for Year 1 to Year 13 students.  One school proposed to merge, Chisnallwood Intermediate, will stay open.</p>
<p>“Bigger schools do not mean better schools,” said Ms Delahunty.</p>
<p>“The vast majority of the feedback to the Government has been that parents, children and their community do not want the Government to push through mergers and mega-schools.</p>
<p>“Communities still reeling from the trauma of the Christchurch earthquakes now have to deal with more upheaval and change with proposed school mergers set for 2017. </p>
<p>“It is great news that Chisnallwood will be allowed to remain open and it is better that children, their parents and school communities have a decent amount of time to plan for the mergers.</p>
<p>“There is a suspicion though that the Government is using Christchurch communities to experiment with supersizing schools and that this policy could move beyond Christchurch.</p>
<p>“Christchurch families have suffered from years of trauma caused by the earthquakes.  These families should not be put through any more stress through badly managed school closures,” Ms Delahunty said.</p>
