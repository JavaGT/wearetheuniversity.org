<p><strong>New Auckland Home for the Rialto Channel 48hours Filmmaking Contest</strong></p>
<p>The countdown to the Rialto Channel 48Hours Filmmaking Contest is on, and AUT University is excited the Auckland leg of the national competition will call the AUT Sir Paul Reeves Building home.</p>
<p>“AUT University is thrilled to be partnering with the 2013 Rialto Channel 48HOURS Filmmaking contest”, says Desna Jury, Dean of AUT’s Faculty of Design and Creative Technologies.</p>
<p>“In 2013 we are delighted to be able to give the Rialto Channel 48HOURS Auckland competition a new home in the recently-opened Sir Paul Reeves Building on AUT’s City Campus. This state-of-the-art facility is the perfect base from which to launch this year’s competition and with it the careers of some of the brightest emerging filmmakers in the country.”</p>
<p>AUT’s Programme Leader Television Diane Musgrave has given entrants her top tips for the 2013 competition, being held this weekend, May 24 to May 26.</p>
<p>1. Story is everything – make it a good one<br>2. Get as organised with gear, crew, actors and props as you can beforehand.<br>3. Ensure a clear division of responsibilities for each person<br>4. Now you can think outside the box – be creative<br>5. Have a good time.</p>
<p>The Sir Paul Reeves Building houses the University’s newest facilities including: performance, television, motion, radio and sound studios, video walls, exhibition spaces, Student radio station ‘Static 88.1fm’, Computer labs, lecture theatres, cafes, study spaces and the Convergent Media Centre - designed to operate as a contemporary newsroom.</p>
