<p><strong>Pen Pushers Win with School Mergers</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First says “super-sizing” Christchurch schools will do nothing to improve education and will only create jobs for pen pushers.</p>
<p>Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says Education Minister Hekia Parata is failing to listen to schools and their communities yet again, by forcing Avondale Primary into a super school merger, when it strongly opposed it.</p>
<p>Avondale is merging with Aranui, High, Aranui Primary and Wainoni.</p>
<p>“There’s at least some good news for Chisnallwood Intermediate students , staff and community who can now put the merger anxiety behind them.</p>
<p>“But schools are emotionally worn out with months of worrying about what lay ahead for them. Today’s news that Aranui High, Aranui Primary, Wainoni and Avondale will form a super school will not end the stress and heartache.</p>
<p>“The schools now have 28 days to respond, but on past record, Avondale in particular may very well feel they’re fighting a losing battle.</p>
<p>“Big mergers make schools easier to run but are not in the best interests of students because they’re too big and impersonal and children can lose their sense of belonging.</p>
<p>“Super schools are great for administrators and bean counters but are not child-focused institutions,” says Ms Martin.</p>
