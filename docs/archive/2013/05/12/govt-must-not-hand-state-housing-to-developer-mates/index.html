<p><strong>Govt must not hand state housing to developer mates</strong></p>
<p>A Government plan to transfer Housing New Zealand properties to the community sector must be not be seen as a chance to abdicate responsibility for vulnerable state tenants or to benefit the Government&#39;s developer mates, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>Housing Minister Nick Smith has announced plans to transfer up to 12,000 Housing New Zealand properties to the community housing sector in a bid to scale back the Government&#39;s role in social housing.</p>
<p>&quot;While growing the role of the community housing sector is an important element of solving the current housing crisis, this looks on the surface like a plan to hand over control of state housing to corporate housing developers,&quot; Green Party housing spokesperson Holly Walker said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a big difference between genuine, non-profit community housing providers, and corporate housing developers who set themselves up as pseudo community providers.</p>
<p>&quot;So far the Governments new Social Housing Fund hasn&#39;t shown adequate ability to differentiate between these in its criteria for awarding funds, so there is a real concern that if Nick Smith&#39;s plan is fast-tracked the beneficiaries will be National&#39;s developer mates, not the thousands of families in urgent need of affordable housing.</p>
<p>&quot;This feels more like this Government just wants to pull out of social housing as much and as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s important that the Government retains its responsibility for the wellbeing of low-incomes families and ensures that tenants in state, community, and private rental accommodation are all living in safe, secure, appropriate housing.</p>

<p>&quot;Transferring properties to the community housing sector shouldn&#39;t be seen as a chance to abdicate Government responsibility for the outcomes of those tenants.</p>
<p>&quot;If carefully managed, with a high degree of Government oversight and responsibility, growing the community housing sector is a very good idea.</p>
<p>&quot;Community providers can be more flexible and deliver appropriate housing for the particular needs of their tenants.</p>
<p>&quot;However, if Nick Smith just wants to get out of the game as quickly as possible the results could be disastrous,&quot; Ms Walker said</p>
