<p><strong>UC Researcher Dr Eileen Britt Awarded Scholarship Named After CTV Building Victim</strong></p>
<p><strong>May 7, 2013</strong></p>
<p>A University of Canterbury (UC) psychology researcher Dr Eileen Britt has been awarded a new scholarship named after CTV building victim Susan Selway.</p>
<p>Susan Selway was a graduate of the postgraduate diploma in clinical psychology programme at UC. After graduating she was a temporary lecturer for the clinical psychology programme and was studying for a PhD in psychology at the time of her death. She was a highly respected clinician in the Christchurch community.</p>
<p>The scholarship was established by the Auckland Branch of the New Zealand College of Clinical Psychologists and the College National Council to help Canterbury members of the College attend continuing educational events.</p>
<p>The scholarship will help Dr Britt attend the International Symposium of Motivational Interviewing in Melbourne next week.</p>
<p>She will be speaking at the Melbourne conference on research she has undertaken with health sciences colleague Dr Mark Wallace-Bell evaluating training motivational interviewing within the context of a university-based course.</p>
<p>``Motivational Interviewing is an evidenced based conversational approach which has been demonstrated to be effective in facilitating behaviour change, including health behaviour change. </p>
<p>``Because of this there is a broad range of health practitioners, such as nurses, dieticians, dental therapists, physiotherapists, social workers and counsellors, who are interested in learning motivational interviewing, and there is a great deal of interest in the most effective training methods.’’</p>
