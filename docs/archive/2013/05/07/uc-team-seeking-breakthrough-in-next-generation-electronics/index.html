<p><strong>UC Research Team Seeking Breakthrough In Next Generation Electronics</strong></p>
<p><strong>May 7, 2013</strong></p>
<p>Could technology developed at the University of Canterbury (UC) be the key to next generation electronics?</p>
<p>A UC team is seeking a breakthrough nano-technology for computer microchips. If successful, it would mean that a Kiwi developed technology could become the next hot item in integrated circuit manufacture.</p>
<p>Computers and other electronic devices have been getting smaller, faster and more functional over the last 30 years.</p>
<p>UC mechanical engineering professor Susan Krumdieck says in 2010 the previously rapid growth in transistor density slowed down.</p>
<p>``This is primarily because the physical limits of properties of materials at the nano-scale are starting to feature in the function of the transistor. </p>
<p>``Researchers have been looking into different materials that might be able to be scaled down further. However, the work-horse of the electronic world – silicon – is still the best material for building semi-conductor electronics.</p>
<p>``Researchers at the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (Imec), a world leading Belgium-based research company in nano-electronics, are working on an idea for the next generation of ever-smaller circuits. </p>
<p>``They work in innovative partnerships in ICT, healthcare and energy. Their research is typically three to 10 years ahead of industry.</p>
<p>``At a recent international conference in Ireland, a researcher from Imec approached me to discuss my ceramic coating technology.</p>

<p>``He had not found any other way, but he thought that the chemical process technology used to produce thin ceramic material films that I had developed here at UC could provide a solution. We are continuing research in this area,’’ Professor Krumdieck says.</p>
<p>UC mechanical engineer Dr Catherine Bishop, chemistry lecturer Dr Sarah Masters, Associate Professor Maan Alkaisi and Professor Krumdieck are starting work on a research project to step up the game in nano-electronics.</p>
<p>The research seeks to both develop and fine tune the processing conditions to create the material Imec is seeking.</p>
