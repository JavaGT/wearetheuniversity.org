<p>CTU Media Release</p>
<p>7 May 2013</p>
<p>Living wage at The Warehouse welcomed</p>
<p>The Council of Trade Unions has congratulated The Warehouse Group and FIRST Union for putting in place steps for a living wage for retail workers at the company.</p>
<p>&quot;Hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders are living on substandard wages that make it impossible for them to fully participate in society,&quot; said Helen Kelly, CTU President.</p>
<p>&quot;Alleviating the hardship faced by many families can only be addressed when we lift workers&#39; wages to a living wage level and today&#39;s announcement is a big step forward for retail workers.&quot;</p>
<p>Helen Kelly said it was welcome that a large employer like the Warehouse could see the benefits of moving to a Living Wage, and it contrasted with Foodstuffs supermarkets Pak n Save and New World, who were isolating themselves as a low wage and youth rates employer.</p>
<p>&quot;The Warehouse understands that by paying better wages, it will retain a loyal workforce and build a better business. Their work with FIRST Union to improve wages and conditions at the Warehouse is a very positive move.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is good to know that in an environment where the government is actively introducing laws to cut workers&#39; pay and conditions and increase inequality that firms like The Warehouse can see the benefits of a moving to higher wage economy. Other firms should follow suit and consumers should support those that do so,&quot; Helen Kelly said.</p>
