<p><strong>Tuesday, 7 May 2013, 5:28 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_Students_Association">Auckland University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Press Release- 07/05/13</strong></p>
<p><strong>Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA)</strong></p>
<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject: IT ALL COMES OFF FOR A CAUSE</strong></p>
<p>Melodie Joseph is a student at the University of Auckland and this afternoon at 3pm in the student Quad she will be shaving her hair at an Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA) event to raise money and awareness for Leukaemia &amp; Blood Cancer New Zealand.</p>
<p>Melodie will be part of 10,000 people shaving their hair for Leukaemia &amp; Blood Cancer New Zealand. She is just one person fundraising for the estimated 10,000 New Zealanders living with a blood cancer or condition like Leukaemia.</p>
<p>“This is an extremely important event for Leukaemia &amp; Blood Cancer New Zealand, as it is the signature fundraising event for the charity. Leukaemia &amp; Blood Cancer New Zealand receives no funding from the government,” says Joseph.</p>
<p>The shaving will take place in the Student Quad. Her hair has grown over a metre. There will be an ‘aucti on’ on the day for the right to cut her hair off. The longer part will be made into a wig and donated to cancer patients.</p>
<p>Afterwards, on looking students will also be asked to volunteer to have their heads shaved. The right to shave each student’s hair will also be ‘auctioned’ off individually to other students to raise further funds on the day.</p>
<p>“When we hear about how much people suffer from cancer, we feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude for our lives. Cancer shouldn&#39;t be a part of someone&#39;s life. Life is meant to be lived, not endured, or passed in suffering.”</p>

<p>“Shaving my head for cancer is barely a sacrifice for me; it’s a reminder that I have been blessed and is able to give back to my fellow human beings.”</p>
<p>Leukaemia &amp; Blood Cancer New Zealand is the national charity dedicated to supporting Leukaemia patients and their families. That support can last for months or even years.</p>
<p>Other students will also be shaving their hair to help raise funds for the cause. Students and friends of the cause are encouraged to support Melodie and Shave for a Cure: Tuesday 7th May, 3.00pm, University of Auckland City QUAD</p>
