<p><strong>Minister needs to keep to Novopay timetable promise</strong></p>
<p>The Minister for Novopay Steven Joyce’s decision to stick to the beleaguered payroll system pending the outcome of the Ministerial Review provides a degree of certainty for school staff but he needs remember his promise to have the problems fixed by June.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa Past President, Ian Leckie says there are still 25-thousand problems to be sorted out and that gives some indication of the extent of the debacle.</p>
<p>“We are pleased that the Minister has acknowledged that schools were never adequately resourced or supported to adopt the decentralised business model and that it is still causing a lot of stress for school support staff and principals.”</p>
<p>“This has been a big learning exercise for the Ministry of Education and it is critical that those lessons drive action in the future.”</p>
<p>Mr Leckie says it is particularly important that schools and principals are consulted and listened to before any further action is taken as a result of the review.</p>
<p>“We also need to identify which Minister signed off on the debacle and expect that to be revealed as the inquiry unfolds.”</p>
<p>The Government has agreed to write off small overpayments of less than $100 per pay period up to a maximum of $300.</p>
<p>“We welcome this pragmatic approach as it will take unnecessary stress away from staff who might otherwise be subject to a collection process.”</p>
