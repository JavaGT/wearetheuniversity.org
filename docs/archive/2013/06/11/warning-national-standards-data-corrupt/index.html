<p>Warning – National Standards Data Corrupt</p>
<p>New Zealand First says today’s release of National Standards data should come with a warning label for parents that the information is “completely useless”.</p>
<p>Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says parents will take one look at the data on reading, writing and maths and think that their children are doing well in the classroom but they are being misled.</p>
<p>“This is because the Ministry has admitted itself that the testing was flawed. Earlier this year, the results from the e-asTTLE writing test produced outcomes that were higher than students had actually achieved.</p>
<p>“The Ministry admitted there was a problem, so adjusted the marks downwards without telling schools which means there will be inconsistencies in the data.</p>
<p>The Education Minister claims today’s data shows Pasifika children in particular recorded the greatest improvement on last year, but the data doesn’t reveal that the performance of Maori and Pasifika students was already rising under successful programmes such as Te Kotahitanga, which have now been scrapped.</p>
<p>“What use is this shonky information? Parents should ignore it. It’s another example of this Government putting New Zealand’s education reputation at risk,” says Ms Martin.</p>
