<p><strong>Private funding of new Aranui school may mean loss to local community</strong></p>
<p>Government plans to allow private companies to build and own the new supersize Aranui school development could severely compromise the concept of it as a community campus, NZEI Te Riu Roa warns.</p>
<p>NZEI Canterbury Area Council Chair Sandra Spekreijse says despite the fact that the Government is still in its consultation phase with the community, it is clear that plans to involve private sector developers in a Public Private Partnership (PPP) are already underway.</p>
<p>Cabinet papers released to NZEI reveal that the Minister delayed the proposed date of the opening of the new school by one year in order to allow for the consideration of a PPP deal, under which private companies design, build and finance the school and are responsible for maintaining them, generally for 25-30 years, before returning to Crown ownership.</p>
<p>“The only PPP school project in New Zealand so far at Hobsonville Point ended up costing taxpayers $1.5 million more than it was claimed it would save.</p>
<p>“The original date proposed that the new school be opened in January 2016. The Minister has delayed the date to January 2017 specifically to allow for development of the PPP proposal.</p>
<p>Christchurch people will be justifiably angry and concerned about this, “ Sandra Spekreijse says.</p>
<p>“They deserve a community education campus that reflects the social and cultural needs of the community. It is important that facilities are accessible to the wider community and that there is a sense of community ownership in the new school.</p>

<p>“The private sector model will be clearly motivated by profit and will therefore lose the community focus. Does this mean, for instance, that community groups will have to pay market rent for things like adult education classes or to use the gymnasium and so on? We now have serious concerns that the concept of a community campus will be severely compromised.</p>
<p>“This is another blow to the Christchurch community. We know that schools provided an important hub for communities following the earthquakes and Christchurch is still suffering in the aftermath. The Government needs to support Christchurch communities instead of removing a key community focus. “</p>
