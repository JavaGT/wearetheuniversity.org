<p><strong>First public viewing of the Shadows of Shoah Exhibition at AUT</strong></p>
<p>Opens: 11 June 2013 | General public: 12-28 June 2013 | School bookings: 17-21 June 2013<br>Venue: Sir Paul Reeves Building, AUT University, Corner Mayoral Drive and Governor Fitzroy Place, Auckland</p>
<p>The Shadows of Shoah exhibition is designed to reach a generation for whom the Holocaust may seem to hold little historical relevance or significance. It is a unique multidisciplinary artistic and educational work; using photography and original music to present selected episodes from survivors&#39; experiences in a brief and compelling format.</p>
<p>Shadows of Shoah is the work of New Zealand photographer, composer and designer Perry Trotter with research and interviews by Sheree Trotter. It was launched by the Prime Minister Rt Hon John Key in January 2013 and will be opened at AUT by His Worship the Mayor Len Brown on 11 June 2013.</p>
<p>“The Shadows of Shoah exhibition, which I was pleased to help launch while marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day, will help remember those who died, recognise the struggle and suffering of those who survived, and help prevent these atrocities happening again. It will also help share some of the overwhelming stories of survival with the world. I encourage you to take some time to view this exhibition. It is important that we remember, in order to learn”, Rt Hon John Key, Prime Minister.</p>
<p>AUT University is proud to be the first public venue for the Shadows of Shoah Exhibition. The Sir Paul Reeves Building is also home to AUT’s School of Communications. As appropriate for ‘The University for the Changing World’ the building is regarded as one of the most contemporary media teaching and learning spaces in this hemisphere and is a fitting location to host this important exhibition, which specifically tries to connect with media-savvy young people.</p>
<p>The exhibition is an interactive experience that utilises multiple HD projectors, HD monitors, motion sensors, custom control software, control PCs, LED lighting and audio equipment – all housed in a 7.76 m diameter circular enclosure. Exhibition entry is limited to seven people every three minutes and a complete viewing takes 21 minutes.</p>
