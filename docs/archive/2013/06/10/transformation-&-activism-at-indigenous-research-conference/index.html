<p>The University of Waikato’s Te Kotahi Research Institute is hosting it’s inaugural indigenous research conference - He Manawa Whenua - at the Claudelands Events Centre in Hamilton in July.</p>
<p>The conference will feature more than 150 individual presentations from International and local speakers involved in indigenous research. Key themes in the keynote presentations are of transformation and activism within research and communities. Professor Linda Tuhiwai Smith is hosting the event and joins Dr Rangi Matamua in the opening session that includes Dr Matamua celebrating Te Wiki o Te Reo Maori with a discussion of the term ‘He Manawa Whenua’ in te reo Maori. Professor Smith follows with an exploration of the relationship between activism, transformation and Indigenous Research. Dr Leonie Pihama, member of the organising committee says the conference “will bring together a range of Indigenous researchers to share research and to engage in conversations about the role of research in creating positive change for our whanau, hapu, iwi and communities”.</p>
<p>Among the international keynote speakers are Waziyatawin, a Dakota writer, teacher, and activist</p>
<p>from the Pezihutazizi Otunwe (Yellow Medicine Village) in south-western Minnesota, Aboriginal rights activist Nala Mansell-McKenna from Tasmania, Dr Jo-Ann Archibald, Associate Dean for Indigenous Education and Director of the Native Indian Teacher Education Program at the University of British Columbia and Dr Debra Harry, a Northern Paiute woman from Nevada who is a global leader in the movement to protect the rights of Indigenous peoples to their genetic resources, indigenous knowledge.</p>
