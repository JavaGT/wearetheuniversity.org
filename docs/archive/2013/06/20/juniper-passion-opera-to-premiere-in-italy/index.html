<p><strong>Juniper Passion Opera to Premiere In Italy</strong></p>
<p>University of Waikato composer Michael Williams is set for the world premiere live performance of his multi-media opera <em>The Juniper Passion</em> in Italy this Friday 21 June.</p>
<p>The opera is set around the Basilica at Monte Cassino, Italy, during World War II and the CD was launched on Anzac Day, last year.</p>
<p>“The Juniper Passion is not your traditional opera,” says Williams. “Each singing character has a dancer as an alter ego.”</p>
<p>The overarching story is based on fact, but the characters are fictional – a Benedictine monk, a German officer and New Zealand soldier.</p>
<p>Michael Williams is a well-known figure in New Zealand composition and has received commissions from most of the country&#39;s major musical institutions including the NZSO, NBR New Zealand Opera and Chamber Music New Zealand and his music is regularly broadcast on Radio New Zealand Concert.</p>
<p>University of Waikato Distinguished Alumnus and historian Dr Chris Pugsley provided valuable historical insights about the battle, the bombing of the abbey and its aftermath which were later translated into the musical retelling of the story, including electronic sound effects, chamber orchestra and even the new Auckland Town Hall organ.</p>

<p>Former staff member and current Unitec lecturer John Davies was the librettist on the opera which was nearly four years in the making. </p>
<p>The libretto for the opera is dedicated to Richard Ferguson Davies – John Davies’ father who fought in the 1944 battles.</p>
<p><em>The Juniper Passion</em> also features singer Julia Booth, a Waikato alumna, and staff members David Griffiths and Rachael Griffiths-Hughes from Music.</p>
<p>The world premiere of <em>The Juniper Passion</em> will be Friday 21 June in Teatro Romano, Cassino, Italy. The tour continues with further performances on 22, 23, 25 and 26 June throughout Italy.</p>
<p>The premiere performance is being live-streamed and can be viewed either live or at a later date by people who choose to purchase a ticket.
