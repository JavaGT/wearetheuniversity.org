<p><strong>University of Waikato ranked in Top 50 worldwide</strong></p>
<p>In less than 50 years the University of Waikato has grown into a world leading institution with the potential to become a future global leader.</p>
<p>That’s the view of Phil Baty, the editor of the Times Higher Education (THE) university ranking publication, which has just confirmed the University of Waikato is among the world’s Top 50 tertiary institutions under 50-years-old.</p>
<p>Its 46th spot in the latest rankings is an improvement of 12 places on 2012, a result University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says is a huge achievement and further confirmation the University is making its presence felt on the world stage.</p>
<p>The new ranking showed the University of Waikato’s focus on sustained improvement was paying dividends and Prof Crawford thanked all staff for their continued commitment.</p>
<p>“This is a tremendous credit to all the staff in the University,” he says.</p>
<p>The rankings are particularly important for the University’s efforts internationally and would be well received by both international students and the growing number of tertiary institutions the University of Waikato has developed close relationships with.</p>
<p>“We look forward to continuing our progression on the world stage and cementing our reputation as one of the exciting new breed of global universities,” he says.</p>
