<p><strong>Te Ururoa Flavell –MP for Waiariki</strong><br><strong>Budget Debate - Wednesday 5 June 2013</strong></p>
<p>Tēnā koe, Mr Assistant Speaker. Ka nui te mihi ki a tātou. Talofa lava. There is a saying in Maoridom that goes something like this: Tama tū, tama ora; tama moe, tama mate. Loosely translated it says something like “Those who are productive will survive and those who sit back will die or perish.” It is a message that has been widely reflected, I think, in Budget 2013.</p>
<p>It reflects the thinking that our whānau will reap the rewards of security in jobs and increasing the income that comes into the homes, and that is important. It is the concept behind Whānau Ora , that together we can achieve the transformation we need to stand on our own two feet and craft our future. But it also could apply that those of us who turn up to Parliament each day and focus on making gains for our people can expect to see results.</p>
<p>This Budget is a pragmatic Budget driven by the needs of the people. It is a Budget that allocates resources that matter, and resources to enable our whānau to stand tall and to stand strong. I want to focus on three things that represent the gains that we of the Māori Party have fought so hard for in this year’s funding, namely, opportunity, support, and sustenance.</p>
<p>The Māori Party has a track record of seizing opportunities, taking big decisions quickly, and grabbing the moment to make the difference. We have been elected into this place to make everything count, to open the doors, and to ensure that the voice of tangata whenua is interwoven throughout every vote, every departmental balance sheet, and every ministerial portfolio. So this Budget builds on that powerful precedent established by Whānau Ora to do what is right for all of our whānau.</p>

<p>A basic moral test for any Parliament is how our most vulnerable members are faring. The Māori Party has always taken steps to protect those of our whānau who are facing challenges, te pani me te rawa kore, and this Budget is an opportunity, a good opportunity, to put resources where they matter most: in our homes, in our kōhanga, in our kura, in our marae, in our daily lives. One of the highlights for us is in the dedicated investment in Māori and Pasifika trades training. It is not just about the $43 million—and that is absolutely sizable—it is about the focus of working in partnerships with iwi, with hapū, with Māori and Pasifika communities, the community groups, and with the employers in the tertiary education organisations. Everyone will be in the same room talking to one another, making sure that Māori and Pasifika learners have the support of vocational training, apprenticeships, qualifications, and even perhaps the cost of the tools themselves.</p>
<p>We have another saying that goes something like this: nā tōu rourou, nā tōku rourou, ka ora te iwi. Working together we can make it happen. That collective and collaborative approach, which Whānau Ora has delivered on and He Kai Kei Aku Ringa, the Māori economic development strategy is built upon, comes together in the form of Marae CBD. This, I believe, is a fantastic initiative, one that the Māori Party campaigned on in the 2011 elections, and I have to say it is revolutionary in its making.</p>
<p>What we see occurring with Marae CBD is the opportunity to restore our marae to thriving hubs of social, cultural, and economic activity to their whānau. It is a great day indeed when $1.2 million is set aside to invest in the entrepreneurship that is marae-led and marae-based. We have worked hard to make sure that we provide all of our children with the best possible chance of success and it starts from early childhood education participation. This Budget delivers $172 million in new investment in early childhood education with the funding targeted to support our most vulnerable communities and is focused on making a big impact amongst Māori and Pasifika communities. That is an opportunity not just in setting a pathway of educational success for our mokopuna, but also to improve upon quality and leadership to make sure that all of our babies are equipped for a brilliant future.</p>
<p>Of course an opportunity can be realised only if we have the courage and the strength to actually last the distance and that is why a second policy plank for our Budget pledges this year has been on support. We knew that to achieve our aspirations to lift whānau incomes it is not just about jobs and training and further education, it is about the dollars and the cents coming into the household.</p>
<p>There are two particular packages that we are proud of having pioneered and that is the emphasis on microfinance and the support for financial literacy. This Budget brings with it a commitment to pilot a partnership with NGOs and financial institutions. In my electorate of Waiariki the Awhi Credit Union has been working for years to help its own families help themselves. It is about mutual self-help. Today we welcome the move to support the provision of low or no interest loans for low-income borrowers. Too many of our families have been caught in a stranglehold of loan sharks who strip them of their dignity and rob them of their finances. I am sure you in your electorate, Mr Assistant Speaker, recognise some of that. This Budget, hopefully, supports them.</p>
<p>Of course, our biggest hope was that we could act on lifting the minimum wage, but, unfortunately, the Government failed on that account—unfortunately, yet again. Perhaps the highlight for us in this year’s Budget has been in the practical support we have pushed for in the area of housing. I want to congratulate our co-leader Tariana Turia for the massive $100 million of home insulation, and, particularly, its focus on low-income households, and those with children or high health needs.</p>
<p>We are also excited about the commitment to trial a warrant of fitness for Housing New Zealand properties and then leading on to other social housing providers. I believe it is a genius idea promoted by the expert advisory group on poverty and it is about supporting our families to thrive in a warm, dry home. This Budget also attempts to address overcrowding, or, more to the point, to support so many of our whānau who know the value of living collectively and choose to live together. Project 324 putting another 2,000 extra bedrooms on to existing homes is a novel approach, I think, of responding to the needs of whānau.</p>
<p>Of course one of the obvious reasons we have focused on healthy homes is to deal with some of the appalling health indicators that have beset Māori and Pasifika communities and whānau for far too long. It beggars belief that despite 9 years of plenty the Labour Government it did nothing to address the rheumatic fever. This Budget almost doubles what we originally achieved with the $24 million signed up to in the relationship accord with National. Tariana Turia has gained another $21 million for rheumatic fever prevention and all credit to her for that fight to keep our children alive.</p>
<p>Another boost and another important health announcement was the $35 million boost of new funding to prevent diabetes and heart disease that took place, I believe, today. When we are talking about survival, that brings me to the third major platform of the Māori Party influence on Budget 2013 and that is, of course, Te Reo Māori me ngā tikanga. From unlikely quarters, one of the first Tweets this afternoon was from Morgan Godfrey, celebrating the fact that papakāinga housing and Te Reo Māori had been increased.</p>
<p>For the benefit of Mr Harawira, who has clearly has not read the Budget, let me count a couple of things that he should have noted: $12 million to support and retain teachers in Māori language immersion education, $8 million for a new Māori language research fund, $5.9 million for priority learners to gain National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) level 2—that is, Māori—an increase of the Mā Te Reo funding of $2.5 million, 30 new scholarships to attract Māori and Pasifika candidates into the teacher education area, and funding for new kura with $134 million for capital funding announced by the Assistant Minister of Education Nikki Kaye. It is one of the most dedicated announcements of funding for Māori medium education that we have ever seen in many years and all credit to my colleague Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>In closing, it is not all good news. Of course, we have asked for a lot more and we still stand resolute in our opposition to the sale of State assets, which has bankrolled this Budget. We have some issues around the welfare reform work stream, and we are deeply concerned at the lack of emphasis on wise environmental stewardship, kaitiakitanga . That aside, this Budget is still about whānau and we hope that it does produce the benefits that we set out in negotiating with the National Party. Ka nui te mihi. Kia ora tātou.</p>
