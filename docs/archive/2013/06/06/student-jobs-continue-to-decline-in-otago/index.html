<p><strong>Student Jobs Continue to Decline in Otago</strong></p>
<p>Student Job earnings are continuing to decline as Student Job Search releases its latest figures for the year to end of May 2013.</p>
<p>“Dollars earned and worker weeks are down on last year and have been down all year. The OUSA had hoped these numbers would turn around but they have remained poor; so far it looks like a bad year for students earning through part time jobs.” Said Hernandez.</p>
<p>Worker weeks were down 7 percent from 6,390 to 6,004 and dollars earned also slumped 7 percent.</p>
<p>“We realise times are tough for students. The job market is tough, and student support is being squeezed. That’s why OUSA is doing our bit to help struggling students by making it cheaper for students to eat on campus by providing free student breakfasts during exams, $3 lunches and looking into cheap dinner deals.” Said Francisco Hernandez, OUSA President.</p>
<p>Student Job Search is a free service for employers and students and can be accessed via <a href="http://www.sjs.co.nz">www.sjs.co.nz</a></p>
