<p><strong>Thursday, 6 June 2013, 8:58 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clare Curran</strong></p>
<p>Communications and IT Spokesperson                       </p>
<p>6 June  2013  MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Why the Delay For Key to Block Huawei?</strong></p>
<p>Chinese technology giant, Huawei, is believed to have been blocked from delivering fibre services and equipment on the taxpayer funded ultrafast broadband programme, says Labour’s Communications and IT spokesperson Clare Curran.</p>
<p>It is believed the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) has stepped in to block the company from the government-led broadband initiative.</p>
<p>“Three of the four New Zealand security echelon partners have outright rejected Huawei’s involvement in their government broadband roll out. The fourth, the United Kingdom, is said to bitterly regret approving a contract with the Chinese company after a forensic audit costing more than £20 million uncovered thousands of bugs in the telco system.</p>
<p>“John Key today confirmed that he knew that Chorus had rejected Huawei’s bid but would not confirm whether he had authorised or instructed the GCSB to intervene,” Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>Huawei already has contracts with two smaller ultrafast broadband providers based in the central North Island and around Christchurch, as well as a contract to deliver rural broadband.</p>
<p>Last year the government announced a multimillion dollar procurement agreement with providers of mobile and data services to public sector agencies, including Huawei phones.  In April this year, Telecom announced it would partner with Huawei to provide 4G mobile services in New Zealand.</p>

<p>“We know that the UK’s own Government Communications Headquarters has an agreement with Huawei, allowing it to vet its devices and source codes for bugs covering British Telecom, but John Key would not reveal whether a similar arrangement exists between GCSB and Huawei in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Having championed Huawei in 2010- virtually offering them contracts on a plate - John Key should be embarrassed that he has had to renege, following pressure from our major security partners.</p>
<p>“John Key’s willingness to strike up a deal before the proper process was followed is no surprise. The Prime Minister would do well to remember that New Zealand’s not a business. You can’t cut deals without proper consultation, especially where our top security partners are concerned.</p>
<p>“The question that remains is why it took so long for John Key to act,” Clare Curran said.</p>
