<p>Ross Robertson <br>Associate Spokesperson for Disarmament</p>
<p>6 June  2013     MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>NZ Plays Part In Historic Signing of Arms Trade Treaty</strong></p>
<p>The signing of a landmark arms trade treaty by 67 member states from around the world has been welcomed by Labour’s Associate Spokesperson for Disarmament and Parliamentarians for Global Action (PGA) President, Ross Robertson.</p>
<p>“I applaud the governments, parliamentarians, civil society, international and regional organisations and the hundreds of thousands of dedicated individuals who have worked tirelessly towards getting this arms trade treaty (ATT) adopted and signed.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is also to be congratulated for being among the first signatories at the historic event held earlier this week.</p>
<p>“This is another important milestone as we embark on our collective goal of enforcing the ATT, aimed at curbing the multibillion-dollar global arms trade, within the shortest possible time frame.</p>
<p>“PGA launched its Campaign for Ratification and Implementation of the ATT on the day of adoption of the ATT on 2nd April, 2013, and already many of our Members are making significant inroads in persuading their governments to sign.</p>
<p>“We expect our members to remain fully galvanized as we now also – in parallel – initiate the process of moving forward with ratifications of the ATT in the Parliaments in over 100 countries worldwide in which PGA Members are active and present.</p>
<p>“I believe that the ATT will, as UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has stated, have a real impact on the lives of those millions of people suffering from the consequences of armed conflict, repression and armed violence,” said Ross Robertson.</p>
