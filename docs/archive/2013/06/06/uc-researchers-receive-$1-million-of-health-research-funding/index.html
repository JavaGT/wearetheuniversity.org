<p><strong>UC Researchers Receive $1 Million of Health Research Funding</strong></p>
<p><strong>June 6, 2013</strong></p>
<p>A University of Canterbury (UC) health researcher has received more than $650,000 of Health Research Council funding to help critically ill patients breathe more easily.</p>
<p>UC mechanical engineering professor Geoff Chase will research how to better support intensive care patients who require breathing support via mechanical ventilation to survive and recover.</p>
<p>Professor Chase says the application of mechanical ventilation can be very variable and difficult, resulting in significant added risks to patients, as well as significant added costs.</p>
<p>The main reason for this difficulty is the inability to directly measure patient-specific condition and response to therapy without invasive, time consuming testing.</p>
<p>This research uses novel, clinically validated models of human lung mechanics with clinical data to identify validated metrics of patient condition and responsiveness to therapy.</p>
<p>These will be used to track condition and guide treatment. The results will clearly define for the first time the evolution and time course of respiratory disease in the intensive care unit (ICU) and demonstrate the ability of engineering model-based methods to optimise mechanical ventilation to improve patient care, and outcomes and reduce cost.</p>
<p>Mechanical ventilation is a costly intensive care therapy affecting up to 50 percent of patients or around 8000 patients in New Zealand a year at a cost of $15 million per year.</p>

<p>Patients requiring mechanical ventilation stay in intensive care 70 percent longer and the cost is 140 percent more than other ICU patients.</p>
<p>``This research will improve health outcomes for all New Zealanders including Maori who are over-represented in the cardiovascular disease and respiratory health statistics that are leading causes of ICU admission and mortality,’’ Professor Chase says.</p>
<p>Another UC researcher, health science professor Ann Richardson, from the UC Wayne Francis Cancer Epidemiology Research Group, has also received $333,221 of Health Research Council funding to research issues relating to breast cancer. Over 2700 New Zealand women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year and over 600 of them die annually.</p>
<p>Professor Richardson says the causes of breast cancer are not fully understood.  Although some important risk factors have been identified it is likely that other risk factors have not.</p>
<p>``It is known that a virus can cause breast cancer in mice and previous research by our team suggested that a virus may be important in human breast cancer. </p>
<p>``We will test stored blood samples from a group of women who donated blood samples to find out whether patterns of exposure to the virus cytomegalovirus differ for women with breast cancer compared with women who do not have breast cancer. </p>
<p>``If this research supports a link between the cytomegalovirus virus and breast cancer it could lead to the worldwide prevention of a significant proportion of breast cancer, for instance by immunisation in early childhood,’’ Professor Richardson says.</p>
<p>Her project will be undertaken in collaboration with researchers in Dunedin, Norway and Finland.</p>
<p>Since the Wayne Francis Cancer Epidemiology Research Group was established at UC in June 2011, it has received $548,623 in research grants from the Canterbury Medical Research Foundation, the Genesis Oncology Trust and the Health Research Council. </p>
<p>This year UC introduced a Bachelor of Health Sciences degree, providing a new opportunity for research-informed teaching in the health sciences.</p>
