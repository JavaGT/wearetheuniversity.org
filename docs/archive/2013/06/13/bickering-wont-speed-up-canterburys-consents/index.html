<p>Ruth Dyson<br>MP for Port Hills</p>

<p><strong>Bickering won’t speed up Canterbury’s consents</strong></p>
<p>Building and Housing Minister Maurice Williamson and Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee’s hands-off approach to the building consent process in the quake-ravaged city won’t impress Cantabrians, says Labour MP for Port Hills Ruth Dyson.</p>
<p>“We are all frustrated with delays, but blame games and buck-passing won’t help anyone.</p>
<p>“Disciplining the council with a time-out by revoking its accreditation to grant building consents is not the progress Cantabrians are looking for.</p>
<p>“Today in Parliament Maurice Williamson said that his department, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, had worked extensively to ensure the council met its statutory obligations.</p>
<p>“Surely that work and lack of progress was fed back to the Minister? To suggest the Ministry was unable to provide a detailed update is ridiculous, given the “extensive work” the Minister said it undertook.</p>
<p>“It looks as though a lack of communication between the Ministers, officials and council is to blame for the current situation.</p>
<p>“The last thing the City needs is another slagging match between government and council about whose process is to blame.</p>
<p>“Maurice Williamson’s tit for tat with Bob Parker over the percentage of building consents completed is also unhelpful.</p>
<p>“If the Minister was aware that the council was behind schedule he should have picked up the phone. A Minister crying foul about a stalled recovery won’t garner any support.</p>
<p>“If Mr Williamson and Mr Brownlee were on top of their portfolios they would pre-empt issues like this before they blow up.</p>
<p>“All Cantabrians want to see is their council and responsible ministers making progress.</p>
<p>“Instead, what they are getting is a re-enactment of Punch and Judy,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
