<p>Codes and ciphers: unravelling the mathematics of the internet</p>
<p>The important role mathematics plays in safely and accurately transmitting information across the internet will be the focus of a public talk in Rotorua next week, being given by Dr Dillon Mayhew, a mathematician from Victoria University.</p>
<p>Dr Mayhew’s talk ‘Codes and ciphers – the mathematics of the internet’ will explore how the modern world has been transformed by the ability to send and receive information instantaneously across the globe.</p>
<p>He will be discussing, in a non-technical way, some of the mathematical principles involved in encrypting confidential information including the role of prime numbers, and the concept of public key cryptography.</p>
<p>“Our world has been completely changed by the ability to send and receive information immediately from almost anywhere on our planet,” says Dr Mayhew.</p>
<p>“The use of codes and ciphers is an important way of making sure that confidential, or secret, information transferred across the internet stays that way.</p>
<p>“We use these in everyday online transactions, such as with banks and companies like Amazon, but they are also used by governments for transferring high-level secret information and, for these situations, more complex codes are required.</p>
<p>“For this to occur, however, a trade-off often has to be made and I’ll be speaking about this balance between efficiency and security in my talk,” he says.</p>
<p>Dr Mayhew is a Lecturer in Victoria University’s School of Mathematics, Statistics and Operations Research. He studied both mathematics and music at Victoria as an undergraduate, before receiving a prestigious Commonwealth Scholarship to complete his PhD in mathematics at the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>In his spare time, Dr Mayhew plays French horn in the Wellington Orchestra.</p>
<p>He will be travelling to the United States later this year, to work with colleagues in the Mathematics department at Princeton University.</p>
<p>Dr Mayhew’s Rotorua lecture is part of the Royal Society of New Zealand’s 10x10 lecture series.</p>
