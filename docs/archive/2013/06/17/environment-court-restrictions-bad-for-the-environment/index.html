<p><strong>Restricting access to Environment Court is bad for the environment</strong></p>
<p>Restricting access to the Environment Court will be a disaster for environmental protection and is yet another attack by this Government on our democracy, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Judith Collins this morning denied that there were further plans to abolish the Environment Court but National Government plans to restrict access to the Environment Court, remain unchanged.</p>
<p>“The Government’s Resource Management Act changes will restrict the ability of New Zealanders to protect the places they care about,” Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman said today.</p>
<p>“This National Government has also removed the right of appeal on plans and policy statements to the Environment Court in Canterbury, and is currently in the process of restricting appeal rights to the Court in Auckland.</p>
<p>“We need environmental rules that protect the places we live and love.</p>
<p>“Restricting access to the Environment Court will just lump more costs onto ratepayers and everyday New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“The only people who benefit from these changes will be the lawyers,” Dr Norman said.</p>
