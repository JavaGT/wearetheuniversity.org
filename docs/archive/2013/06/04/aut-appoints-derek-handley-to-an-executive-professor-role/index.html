<p><strong>AUT appoints Derek Handley to an Executive Professor role</strong></p>
<p>Derek Handley, one of New Zealand’s most well-known entrepreneurs, has taken up an Adjunct Executive Professorship at AUT.</p>
<p>Handley is CEO of The B Team, and Chairman of the recently launched mobile advertising company Snakk and Derek McCormack, AUT’s Vice Chancellor, sees his Executive Professorship as offering great benefits to AUT.</p>
<p>“Derek’s contribution to business and innovation is inspirational and his insights will be invaluable to our students’ thinking about enterprises or working in business. He is able to provide both a New Zealand and a global perspective. His reputation in international business and entrepreneurship brings much to the University” says Vice Chancellor Derek McCormack.</p>
<p>As Executive Professor, Derek Handley will work with Dr Geoff Perry, Dean of AUT’s Business School, and his first task will be to make a public address on Tuesday 4 June 2013 from 1:00-2:00pm in the Forum area of AUT’s Sir Paul Reeves Building. At the event Derek will be talking about his successes and failures while beginning and building multiple international start-ups, highlighting techniques for designing one’s life dreams and making them happen.</p>
<p>Derek Handley worked alongside Sir Richard Branson and Jochen Zeitz to start the B Team, which is a global leadership collective aimed at making business work better for people and the planet in order to meet the challenges of the 21st century. He is also a Sir Peter Blake Trust Leader, KEA World Class New Zealander and was the Ernst &amp; Young ‘Young Entrepreneur of the Year’ in 2009.
