<p>Government in denial over state of manufacturing</p>
<p>No amount of National Party spin can disguise the decline of the manufacturing sector in New Zealand, says the Labour Leader David Shearer.</p>
<p>“John Key wants Kiwis to believe that all is well in manufacturing. But he is kidding himself. The facts paint a very different picture.</p>
<p>“In the last year alone 17,000 jobs have been lost in manufacturing. Manufactured exports outside of the primary sector are in long-term decline and have fallen by 17 per cent in real terms since 2008.</p>
<p>“The truth is that the Canterbury rebuild and the primary sector are the only real drivers of manufacturing activity – and growth in the meat industry is largely a result of farmers sending more stock to the works because of this year’s drought. That is hardly a success story.</p>
<p>“New Zealand cannot continue to rely so heavily on the agriculture and dairy industries to create our high-value jobs. It’s just not sustainable.</p>
<p>“The Opposition’s report into manufacturing charts a path towards a stronger more diversified economy. An economy that will create and sustain high-skill, high-pay jobs need to keep our best and brightest in New Zealand rather than Australia.</p>
<p>“We need a smart, active government that will back our manufacturers and exporters. Labour will tackle our overvalued and volatile dollar, encouraging innovation through R&amp;D tax credits and give Kiwi companies first crack at government contracts.</p>
<p>“John Key might be satisfied watching the sad decline of manufacturing, but I’m not. The government I lead will get serious about supporting our manufacturers and building a high-skill, high wage economy,” says David Shearer.</p>
