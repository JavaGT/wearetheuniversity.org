<p>18 June  2013   MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Simon Bridges misleads Parliament</strong></p>
<p>Simon Bridges&#39; refusal to meet with International Labour Organisation (ILO) officials to discuss his government&#39;s employment law changes shows his disdain for international workers conventions, and confirms he misled Parliament, says Labour&#39;s spokesperson for Labour Issues Darien Fenton.</p>
<p>&quot;Two weeks ago Mr Bridges told Parliament that he would ask the ILO whether his Employment Relations Amendment Bill breached international conventions.</p>
<p>“Now he has landed in Geneva, it seems he’s had a change of heart.</p>
<p>&quot;There are two serious issues here. The first is that our employment laws specifically recognise ILO conventions. The government has ignored advice that its employment law changes will breach these.</p>
<p>“A breach of this nature could expose New Zealand to a complaint from the ILO, which is as serious as it is unnecessary.</p>
<p>&quot;The second is that Simon Bridges has misled Parliament in his reply to an oral question and in doing so, misled the hundreds of thousands of Kiwi workers who rely on the Minister to be true to his word.</p>
<p>&quot;If he&#39;s not going to seek advice from the ILO, we have to wonder why he is in Geneva at all,” Darien Fenton said.</p>
