<p>Lincoln University to host agri-business forum</p>
<p>On Wednesday 3 July Lincoln University will be hosting on campus the AgriTech Exec Forum 2013, an intense, one-day, case study-based programme of learning where participants are immersed in debates about what defines success and failure for real New Zealand agri-tech firms going global, enriched by facilitated, roundtable discussions with business peers.</p>
<p>The forum is hosted by Lincoln University and Waikato University, with support from National Fieldays Ltd, Canterbury Development Corporation, and the Waikato Innovation Park. It is focussed on how New Zealand companies with products and services for the agri-sector can grow by going global.</p>
<p>“The forum has been designed to be interactive and for participants to have in depth discussions with real entrepreneurs and business leaders,” says AgriTech Exec Forum Organiser and Dean of Lincoln University’s Faculty of Commerce Dr Hugh Bigsby.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day participants would have had the opportunity to question, debate, challenge and learn from real-life stories on how other New Zealand companies have navigated through economic changes within New Zealand and how they were able to expand, and tap into offshore markets. For example, lessons about going into China, developing supply chains, SME’s journey into international markets from the challenges of remoteness of New Zealand, etc.”</p>
<p>It has been designed for leaders of companies that may be looking to:</p>
