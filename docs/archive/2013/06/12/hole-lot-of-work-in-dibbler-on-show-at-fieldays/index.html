<p><strong>Hole lot of work in dibbler on show at Fieldays</strong></p>
<p>Seems a fairly simple thing to dig a straight hole but it took University of Waikato senior lecturer in engineering Dr Mike Duke and his team several months to perfect a machine which drills holes accurate enough to ensure pine cuttings grow straight.</p>
<p>The hole-drilling dibbler was built from scratch at Waikato University for treestock company ArborGen, which uses it to drill holes in nursery beds for pine cuttings to be planted in.</p>
<p>Cuttings which don’t grow perfectly straight are rejected before being planted out into forests and Dr Duke says the machine has helped the company improve productivity by an estimated 30%.</p>
<p>“They had a lot of rejects because the holes were not straight and varied in depth,” Dr Duke says.</p>
<p>ArborGen NZ’s Operations Manager Mark Ryan says: “We are New Zealand’s largest nursery producer of pine trees for the forest sector. The company plants many millions of trees each year and reject trees are a significant and unwanted expense.”</p>
<p>The dibbler – which is towed behind a tractor - is entirely computer controlled and can be adjusted for different types of tree, varying soil hardness, holes of different depths and to operate at varying speeds.</p>
<p>“It’s all adjustable from the cab,” Dr Duke says.</p>
<p>“It’s a very professional piece of machinery that is now fully operational and doing a great job.”</p>
<p>Dr Duke is putting the dibbler on display at the National Agricultural Fieldays – which run from today to Saturday at Mystery Creek, near Hamilton. The University of Waikato is a strategic partner of Fieldays.</p>

<p>It will be on show in the Innovation Centre where it’s entered into the annual innovation competition and while Dr Duke doesn’t expect to win, it’s a good opportunity to show off the work being done by Waikato University academics, many of whom have a proven track record in the agritech field.</p>
<p>“The main objective is to demonstrate real-world solutions in the local agritech industry,” he says.</p>
<p>The $110,000 project was jointly funded by the company and TechNZ.</p>
