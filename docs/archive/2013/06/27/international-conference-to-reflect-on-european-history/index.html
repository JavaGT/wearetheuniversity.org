<p><strong>International conference to reflect on European history</strong></p>
<p>Some of the world’s leading academics on European history will gather in Wellington next week to reflect on cohesion and division in Europe from the 18th to the 21st centuries.</p>
<p>They will be attending the Australasian Association for European History’s 23rd biennial conference at Victoria University from 2-5 July.</p>
<p>Speakers include Professor Joanna Bourke, internationally-esteemed scholar of British and European history from Birkbeck University of London, who will discuss the modern European commitment to human rights; Professor Peter McPhee from the University of Melbourne, who will explore the increasingly aggressive assertions of ethnic identity and exclusiveness that have been emerging in Europe since 2008; and Geoff Eley from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, who will focus on democratic political development in 19th and 20th century Europe.</p>
<p>The conference is supported by Victoria University, the University of Western Australia, the University of Otago and the EUC Network.</p>
<p><strong>There is a charge for this conference, with full registration or one day options. For more information visit <a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz/hppi/research/conferences/faultlines">http://www.victoria.ac.nz/hppi/research/conferences/faultlines</a></strong></p>
