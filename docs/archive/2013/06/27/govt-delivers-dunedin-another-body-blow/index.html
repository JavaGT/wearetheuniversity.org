<p>Govt delivers Dunedin another body blow</p>
<p>The National Government has again showed its disdain for Dunedin, sending another 73 hard working locals to the dole queue with little hope of finding alternative employment, Labour Dunedin MPs Clare Curran and David Clark said.</p>
<p>“NZ Post job losses will hit our region hard. 73 Jobs in Dunedin, and further losses in Otago-Southland region contribute to a total of 500 jobs nationwide being cut”, the MPs said.</p>
<p>“While some new jobs are being created they are in just three cities. By contrast most workers losing their jobs are in the provinces. New Zealand Post admits just five per cent will be able to relocate to take the new jobs on offer.</p>
<p>“These losses follow a string of job losses, most notably over 100 jobs from Hillside Workshops in the last year and 192 from Summit Wool spinners in Oamaru. Losses have also occurred at O’Brien’s in Mosgiel, Delta and Port Otago to name a few.</p>
<p>“Countless Government agencies have been closed or gutted in Dunedin with remote call centres replacing face to face contact for our most vulnerable. The Government has cut 154 full-time state sector jobs in Otago over the last three years.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile the National Government supports Sky City and speculators in Auckland’s property market. While the Christchurch rebuild is providing work for some, disaster recovery is not a sustainable economic plan.</p>
<p>“Dunedin has to stand up for itself. Our elected leaders, thinkers and the business community need to come together and commit to a set of actions to take our city forward in the next decade.</p>
<p>“The National Government has deserted the regions, and it has deserted Dunedin,” The MPs said.</p>
