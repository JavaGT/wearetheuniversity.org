<p>Seven Massey students win NZFGW scholarships</p>
<p>Seven Massey students received scholarships presented by the North Shore Branch of the New Zealand Federation of Graduate Women (NZFGW) at a ceremony held on campus recently. The three first-year students and four postgraduate students received awards totalling $15,000.</p>
<p>The postgraduate awards were presented by Assistant Vice Chancellor Research and Enterprise Professor Brigid Heywood, and the guest speaker was Associate Professor Anne Dupuis from the School of People, Environment and Planning.</p>
<p>The 2013 NZFGW North Shore Branch Scholar of the Year awarded to PhD student and new mother Michelle Ingram, along with a $5000 prize. Ms Ingram’s research focuses on plaque-type psoriasis, and aims to find out if supplementation with Vitamin D is an effective treatment. Having given birth to her son that same week, Ms Ingram was unable to attend the ceremony, so her supervisor, Dr Pamela Von Hurst from the Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health, accepted the award on her behalf.</p>
<p>Amy Montagu, currently in her second year of study towards a Doctorate of Clinical Psychology, was awarded $3000. Ms Montague also juggles motherhood with study, and says winning the award is fantastic. “It helps with childcare and research expenses. Nobody seems to have a landline these days, so my phone bills are pretty high.” Her research is based on a guided self-help programme for people with depression and anxiety. In addition to using a specially-designed book, participants also receive support from Ms Montagu either face-to-face or over the phone.</p>
<p>Masters of nutrition and dietetics students Briar Emmett and Georgia Wakefield were each awarded $2000 to go towards their research costs. Ms Emmett’s research focuses on the post-discharge nutrition of pre-term babies who are at high risk of developing certain vitamin deficiencies. Babies born after 32 weeks, and before 37 weeks gestation don’t receive a key vitamin D and iron supplement, and Ms Emmett’s research also includes testing maternal vitamin D levels.</p>
<p>Ms Wakefield’s research focuses on evaluating the outcomes of the Garden to Table project, currently run in Auckland schools, on children’s fruit and vegetable intake. She hopes to share her research findings at a conference in Brisbane with researchers evaluating the Stephanie Alexander kitchen garden programme in Australia.</p>
<p>NZFGW Academic Dress Committee chair Margaret Ellett presented the three first-year tertiary study awards to Grace Barlow, formerly of Long Bay College and now studying for a degree in nursing, former Albany Senior High School student Hayley Edmond, studying for a degree in social work, and Paula Farmer, who attended Rangitoto College, and is now studying for a Bachelor of Science.</p>
<p>The North Shore Branch of the NZFGW first presented awards in 1999, with one postgraduate and one first-year award presented. Since then, they have awarded over $256,000 in scholarships to help women with their studies.</p>
<p>NZFGW Awards Committee Chair Frances Bell says funds are raised through the voluntary work of branch members, who help with the herculean task of providing the academic regalia for graduation ceremonies on the North Shore.</p>
<p>“Our commitment to raising these funds reflects the value we all place on education, and especially, on its importance in opening up opportunities for women.”</p>
<p>In addition to the awards presented, the NZFGW also supports mature women beginning tertiary study through scholarships offered through the New Horizons for Women Trust.  </p>
