<p><strong>Master’s Student Explores Sound Through Movement</strong>  </p>
<p>The desire to create electronic music prompted Victoria University Master’s student Byron Mallett to design Sonoromancer, a computer programme that turns movement into sound.</p>
<p>Sonoromancer creates a smoke-like interpretation of a person’s body movements using an Xbox 360 Kinect camera coupled with a projector. The result is a unique composition of audio and visual elements, with each movement making a different sound.</p>
<p>“You have to think about how your movements will create sound, which causes people to move differently depending on the sound they want to hear back,” says Mr Mallett.</p>
<p>Mr Mallett spent three months on the project as part of Victoria’s new Computer Graphics programme, set up in 2012 in collaboration with Weta Digital and other local industry partners.</p>
<p>The project was inspired by previous ideas about using sensors to control effects applied to live violin performances. The idea was developed into a programme that creates electronic music rather than just enhancing it.</p>
<p>“I was caught by surprise to see how people interacted with the programme as a method of physical expression rather than as solely a musical tool.”</p>
<p>The project was initially designed for musicians, but evolved into a piece which allows people with little musical knowledge to participate in spontaneous musical composition.</p>
<p>Mr Mallett plans on improving Sonoromancer to make it suitable for multiple performers and to develop the visual aspect of the programme.</p>
<p>“I&#39;d love to see the project reach a stage where I can distribute it to others and see the different creations people will make.”</p>
