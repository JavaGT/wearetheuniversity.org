<p><strong>Friday, 1 February 2013, 2:57 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/LUSA_-_Lincoln_University_Students">LUSA - Lincoln University Students</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Steering group to include LUSA President</strong></p>
<p>On 29th January, Lincoln University announced it will commence a reform of its qualifications. It has now been comfirmed that students have a conduit into the process with the Lincoln University Students’ Association President, Kent Lloyd being accepted onto the Steering Group.</p>
<p>“We knew a new Vice--Chancellor would bring a new vision for Lincoln that would result in change and we are looking forward to being part of that process. Students want a chance to be heard at all levels around the University,” says Lincoln University Students’ Association President, Kent Lloyd.</p>
<p>The Steering Group will include a number of staff from the Vice--Chancellor’s Office, the three faculty Deans, a representative from the TEU and the LUSA President. The overall process will be lead by Assistant Vice--Chancellor, Academic Programmes and Student Experience, Professor Sheelagh Matear.</p>
<p>Aside from having input, LUSA’s main focus is protecting the interests of present and future students. “We recognize that some existing qualifications may be changed but this won’t happen overnight and would have to happen over a reasonable period. Further to this, we acknowledge there could be benefits from the pathways that new qualifications may create,” concluded Lloyd.</p>
