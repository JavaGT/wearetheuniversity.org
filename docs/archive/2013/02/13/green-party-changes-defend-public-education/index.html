<p><strong>Green Party changes defend public education</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party is promising to integrate Charter Schools into the public education system as it outlines a caucus reshuffle focussed on defending the public education system and eradicating child poverty.</p>
<p>The major change in the reshuffle is that Co-leader Metiria Turei will take overall responsibility for education, with Catherine Delahunty taking on associate spokesperson responsibilities.</p>
<p>“Our public education system has never been under as much threat as it is from the National Government today and children are the ultimate victims of this,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
<p>“We will vigorously defend our public education system on behalf of children, parents and schools.</p>
<p>“The Salvation Army’s State of the Nation report today revealed the education gap between wealthier kids and poorer kids is growing once again.</p>
<p>“That’s a huge indictment on the John Key Government which seems hell bent on making children, especially poor children, pay the ultimate price for its political agenda.</p>
<p>“We believe that a strong, free, inclusive public education can transform lives, families, communities and societies and is pivotal to eradicating poverty.<br>.<br>“That’s why two of our most senior MPs will work on education.</p>
<p>“Catherine has done a fantastic job and is a well-respected MP on education in Parliament and within the sector. As Associate she will be responsible for ECE, adult education, Christchurch renewal and curriculum issues,” Mrs Turei said.</p>

<p>Mrs Turei will retain overall responsibility for social issues.</p>
<p>The Green Party also announced it would integrate charter schools into the public education system as soon as there is an opportunity.</p>
<p>“Charter Schools are a waste of money, and are completely counter to everything Kiwis love about our world leading public education system,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
<p>“We will ensure teachers are trained professionals and that every child enrolled at a Charter school is better off under the changes.</p>
<p>“We will stand up for students, parents, schools, and teachers, and introduce creative and innovative policies that fight vigorously for good public education that’s free, and inclusive of all children.</p>
<p>As part of the reshuffle, David Clendon will now have responsibility for the Justice Portfolio and Julie Anne Genter picks up Commerce, Associate Finance and Economics and Associate Climate Change.</p>
<p>David is passionate about Justice and Julie Anne Genter is a rising star regularly embarrassing the Government about its failed case for the Roads of National Significance.</p>
