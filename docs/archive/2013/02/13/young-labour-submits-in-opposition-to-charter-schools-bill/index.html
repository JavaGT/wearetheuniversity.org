<p>Young Labour Submits in Opposition to Charter Schools Bill</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s plans for charter schools are a stealth privatisation of education, and fail to give communities control over their schools, say Young Labour Policy Officer Keir Leslie.</p>
<p>He says: “Schools funded by the government that don&#39;t have to employ qualified teachers, that don&#39;t have to listen to their communities, that aren&#39;t covered by the OIA, aren&#39;t accountable to the Ombudsmen and Auditor General, and that don&#39;t have to follow the national curriculum are an awful idea.”</p>
<p>“Young Labour hopes that the Committee listens, and says to the government that it isn&#39;t OK to use New Zealand&#39;s most vulnerable as guinea pigs”.</p>
<p>“Coming just days before the government announces school closures in Christchurch, we&#39;d like to see the government listen, and put education before ideology.”</p>
<p>“Young Labour very much wants New Zealand to be at the centre of educational reform and innovation, but we know that this ideologically driven privatisation of education is not the innovation we need.”</p>
<p>“This move away from teacher professionalism and educational quality is a straightforward assault on the New Zealand values of opportunity, fairness and equity.”</p>
<p>Young Labour member, Joe Davies, says “I went to Linwood College, a decile 2 school in the eastern part of Christchurch.”</p>
<p>“It taught me many values and morals that I will hold beyond this day – Linwood College was where students wanted to go to school.”</p>
<p>“Linwood College is exactly the kind of school that the Ministry of Education is going to use as its guinea pig. A test rat of the partnership school experiment.”</p>
<p>The Education and Science Select Committee will be hearing Young Labour&#39;s submission from 10 am Friday 15th February at the Wigram Air Force Museum, Christchurch.</p>
