<p>Real sense of optimism in Christchurch, John Key says at UC</p>
<p>February 22, 2013</p>
<p>There was a real sense of optimism in Christchurch now, Prime Minister Hon John Key said at the University of Canterbury campus today during the second anniversary of the 2011 earthquake.</p>
<p>There was also greater expectation of what Christchurch will become, he told leading UC academics, senior management staff and students.</p>
<p>``I am absolutely convinced this will be the most liveable city in New Zealand once the rebuild has been completed. For obvious reasons we never get the chance to plan a city the way that we are now planning the new and modern Christchurch. This will be an incredible</p>
<p>place to live.</p>
<p>``UC is an integral part of Christchurch. It is a magnificent university and one of the gems in the crown. It’s a great university.</p>
<p>``I remember my time at UC extremely fondly and times like orientation week. In my time here during O-week we would have a champagne breakfast of beer and sausages then studied our butts off for six weeks before exams.’’</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said New Zealand needed students pouring out of institutions like UC into companies and organisations to help make New Zealand stronger.</p>
<p>Earlier, he chatted freely with students during UC’s Orientation Week clubs day, signed shirts and put his autograph on a playhouse to be auctioned on TradeMe for charity by UC’s Student Volunteer Army.<br>ends</p>
