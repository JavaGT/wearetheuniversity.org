<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader<br>27 February 2013</p>
<p><strong>PSA Kiwifruit Bacteria Entered NZ From China Says Expert</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huge Court Cases Bound To Follow</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First warns that Government cuts to biosecurity will lead to another disaster to match the Psa kiwifruit bacteria outbreak which has been identified as reaching the country in a consignment of anthers from Shaanxi Province in China to Kiwi Pollen Ltd in June 2009.</p>
<p>It is understood that Otago University associate professor Russell Poulter undertook genetic analysis to trace the Psa bacteria which he found had entered New Zealand from China through Kiwi Pollen Ltd.</p>
<p>Estimates put the damage Psa will do to our kiwifruit industry at about $900 million.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters says Government assurances that it has been objective and rigorous in investigating the biosecurity breach are hollow.</p>
<p>“The Government is going about an inquiry seeking to avoid the truth because that means countless expensive court cases for failing to exercise a duty of care.</p>
<p>“There is no doubt that the Government’s lax biosecurity allowed the Psa virus to enter New Zealand undetected from China.</p>
<p>“Psa continues to cause havoc in the kiwifruit industry. Jobs have been lost and massive financial and mental pain inflicted on innocent fruit growers.</p>
<p>“Of real concern are Government cuts to biosecurity which have significantly weakened our border controls. They include the loss of 25 frontline staff since 2008, and $2 million of cuts to biosecurity budgets since 2009.</p>

<p>“It’s obvious that the Government hasn’t learned anything from the Psa outbreak but New Zealand First is willing to give it a short, sharp lesson.</p>
<p>“Biosecurity needs to be beefed up to prevent the devastation of other important primary industries, not cut back to save a few dollars.</p>
<p>“Sadly, National thinks that short term savings outweigh the long term risks of another alien body entering our country and causing billions of dollars damage.</p>
<p>“How wrong they are,” says Mr Peters.</p>
