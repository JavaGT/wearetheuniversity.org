<p><strong>17,000 drop in manufacturing jobs last year</strong></p>
<p>Over 17,000 manufacturing jobs were lost last year, showing the sector needs new ideas and action to halt its decline, says Labour’s Finance spokesperson David Parker.</p>
<p>“2012 was a bad year for workers in the manufacturing sector. There were 17,200 fewer people in jobs at the end of it with the number falling every quarter. It doesn’t come as a surprise with jobs cuts being announced every week.</p>
<p>“Summit Wool Spinners is the first big jobs cut announcement of the year. It shows how precarious manufacturing is.</p>
<p>“John Key doesn’t seem to realise that behind the 17,000 figure are Kiwis trying to find another job and families struggling to pay the bills.</p>
<p>“National refuses to take action on manufacturing. They’ve left that up to Labour and our fellow opposition parties to set up the Manufacturing Inquiry.</p>
<p>“A strong manufacturing sector creates good jobs that pay good wages. That’s something Kiwis desperately need. It also boosts exports. That reduces the staggering $10 billion gap between what we buy and pay in interest and what we sell offshore that we as a country need to close.</p>
<p>“Modern manufacturing using new technology is the future for better jobs, more exports and higher incomes. That’s how we support the thousands who lost their jobs last year.”</p>
