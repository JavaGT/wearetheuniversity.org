<p><strong>Cycling black spots need priority action from Govt</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party today called on the National Government to properly fund safer cycle ways in light of a recent study that reveals several key accident black spots for cycling.</p>
<p>The Dunedin School of Medicine has released an interactive map highlighting streets with high ‘dooring’ risks for cyclists. These streets include Tamaki Drive in Auckland, Victoria Street in Hamilton, and Riccarton Rd in Christchurch. ‘Dooring’ refers to the opening of a car door on a passing cyclist, often resulting in serious injury or death.</p>
<p>“New research sets out some clear priorities for urgent road improvements,” said Green Party transport spokesperson Julie Anne Genter.</p>
<p>“The National Government now needs to front up with the cash to protect some of our most vulnerable road users.</p>
<p>“A relatively small investment in safer cycling infrastructure is often all that’s required to ensure the safety of cycling through these accident black spots.</p>
<p>“‘People opening car doors on cyclists is a significant safety threat, and smarter road design is the best way to reduce the hidden risk.</p>
<p>“The National Government hasn’t made road safety a priority during their time in office, especially for walking and cycling.</p>
<p>“The current budget for walking and cycling is pitiful, constituting just 1.3 per cent of the total $12.3 billion land transport spend.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders of all ages have a right to get around on a bicycle safely.</p>
<p>“The Government should prioritise smart green transport options like cycling because they are low-cost, low-carbon, and great for health.”</p>
