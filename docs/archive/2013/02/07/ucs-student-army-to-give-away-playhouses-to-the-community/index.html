<p>UC’s student army to give away playhouses to the community</p>
<p>February 7, 2013</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury’s Student Volunteer Army (SVA) will auction a child’s playhouse this month on Trade Me with all proceeds going to the Ronald McDonald house.</p>
<p>A second playhouse gifted to the SVA will be donated to a Christchurch pre-school or family. Each playhouse has an estimated value of $1600.</p>
<p>SVA president Bridget Williams said the playhouse project signalled the start of the student year at UC and they had set up five platoons to provide even more voluntary work in Christchurch. The platoons were named creativity, muscle, green, dish it up, baking and outreach.</p>
<p>Our creativity platoon is mostly fine arts students who will brighten up the university and Christchurch by doing creative things. They will work with Gap Filler to help fill the negative spaces around the city.</p>
<p>``The muscle platoon will be made up of students who are keen to do some physical labour. If there’s a service project that requires moving bricks, building things or cleaning houses they will do it.</p>
<p>``Our green platoon will be mostly made up of forestry students or anyone who cares about the environment.</p>
<p>``Dish it up platoon students will help the hungry. They will work with the Salvation Army and host soup kitchens. Later in the year we plan to pick a neighbourhood that has suffered a great deal and we want to throw a street party.’’</p>
<p>She said out-reach platoon students will help charities and families. Volunteering will start on Clubs Day on February 21.</p>
<p>Williams said the days of shovelling liquefaction were hopefully over for SVA students and would be replaced by a raft of community service projects this year.<br>ends</p>
