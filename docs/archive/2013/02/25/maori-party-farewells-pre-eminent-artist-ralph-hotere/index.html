<p><strong>Maori Party farewells pre-eminent artist Ralph Hotere</strong></p>
<p><em>Te Aupouri, Ngapuhi nui tonu, kua whakarerea tatou ko te whanau o Hotere, ko nga iwi katoa, ko nga tohunga toi huri noa i te ao!</em><br><em>E te rangatira, kua hinga koe, kua moe koe, kua timata to hokinga wairua atu ki o tipuna.</em><br><em>Takahia te ara whanui a Tane, ma Mitimiti, ma Te Oneroa a Tohe, ma Te Rerenga Wairua ki te Po!</em><br><em>Haere ki o hoa, ki a Hone Tuwhare ma, ki a Arnold Wilson, ki a Katerina Mataira, ki a Buck Nin ma - ki tera reanga i whai i te pae tawhiti.</em><br><em>Haere ki te puna o te whakapono, ki a Hone Papita ma, ki te huinga o te kahurangi.</em><br><em>Nau nga tikanga Maori i whakauru ki nga momo toi o te ao! Nau ano nga momo toi katoa i whakamāori!</em><br><em>Waiho o mahi ataahua hei whakamaumaharatanga ki a koe.</em><br><em>Haere, haere, haere atu ra!</em></p>
<p>The Maori Party are saddened by the loss of one of our great New Zealand artists, Hone Papita Raukura ‘Ralph’ Hotere no Te Aupouri, and remember fondly the contribution that he has made to our nation.</p>
<p>Dr. Pita Sharples said “Ralph Hotere was well known internationally for his wonderful artworks, but he was also a much loved man who was respected within our Maori communities.”</p>
<p>“He was an old friend of mine, and we used to hang out regularly while we were all living in Auckland during the 60’s. He was as humble as they came. Despite his obvious talents, he would never accept praise, he tangata whakaiti, he tangata humarie.”</p>

<p>“More than an artist, Ralph’s artworks encapsulated much of the struggle that tangata whenua were facing during his time. He was an activist; he was a thought provoking philosopher; and he was an advocate for Maori rights.”</p>
<p>“He may have been a quiet man, but he certainly found a way to communicate his thoughts about the world through his artwork. And he obviously had a wonderful understanding of the world around us.”</p>
<p>“We are proud of his achievements both here in Aotearoa and internationally – he pushed boundaries, he led the way for New Zealand art, and as a result he has earned his place in our history.”</p>
<p>“He was born in Mitimiti (Hokianga), and schooled at Hato Petera College in Auckland. Everywhere he stepped throughout his life, he made an impact. He moved to the other end of the motu - to Dunedin, but also travelled the world to refine his craft.”</p>
<p>“He took our culture to the world, and he took our aspirations as tangata whenua and enticed people to engage in our history and our stories. He had refined artistic skill, but he was also a story teller at heart, and it was our Maori stories that he told so well.”</p>
<p>“He will be sorely missed, and we send our aroha and condolences to his whanau. Moe mai, moe mai e te rangatira.”</p>
