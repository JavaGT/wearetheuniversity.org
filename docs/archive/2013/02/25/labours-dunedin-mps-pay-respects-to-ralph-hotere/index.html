<p>25 February 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Labour’s Dunedin MPs pay respects to Ralph Hotere</strong></p>
<p>Dunedin&#39;s electorate MPs David Clark and Clare Curran have paid their respects to Port Chalmers artist Ralph Hotere, ONZ, who died yesterday in Dunedin aged 81.</p>
<p>&quot;Ralph&#39;s works were highly sought after. His admission to the Order of New Zealand reflected his contribution to our identity and sense of place. He was a retiring man who made extraordinary use of ordinary objects.</p>
<p>&quot;Ralph&#39;s Aramoana work played an important role in saving the wetlands at the Otago Harbour mouth. History shows he was on the right side of many social issues and a tireless campaigner.</p>
<p>Labour Leader David Shearer said earlier: “Ralph Hotere was one of this country’s most important contemporary artists. His works were provocative and thoughtful. He boldly tackled controversial political issues and challenged our way of thinking.</p>
<p>“We send our sincere condolences to the family and friends of Ralph Hotere as they mourn his passing.”</p>
<p>&quot;His significance stretches beyond Port and beyond Dunedin, but we in particular will mourn the loss of one of this city&#39;s most loved and distinguished citizens,&quot; Clare Curran and David Clark said.</p>
