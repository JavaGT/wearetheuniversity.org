<p>David<br>SHEARER<br>Labour Leader</p>
<p>25 February 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Fresh caucus line-up focused on the future</strong></p>
<p>Labour Leader David Shearer has today unveiled a new look line-up of MPs who are energised and excited about the challenge of creating a fresh and better future for New Zealand.</p>
<p>“My Shadow Cabinet includes a mix of new talent and experienced hands. They are raring to go and keen to get stuck in to tackling the issues that matter most to Kiwis.</p>
<p>“My decisions today have been driven by the need to appoint the best people to deliver Labour’s solutions for the critical challenges facing New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The changes start at the top with my deputy Grant Robertson taking responsibility for jobs. There is no bigger challenge facing this country. Under National, Kiwis are hurting. The country is rudderless and people are losing hope. That must change.</p>
<p>“David Parker will have a new off-sider with David Clark taking on the Economic Development portfolio with a particular emphasis on green growth and finding ways to diversify our economy. This is a well-deserved promotion for a rising star.</p>
<p>“Annette King and Phil Twyford have also been promoted to the Front Bench with the portfolios of Health and Housing respectively. These are key concerns for New Zealanders and that’s why I have appointed two of our top performers to these roles.</p>
<p>“Chris Hipkins thoroughly deserves his appointment to full-time Education spokesperson. He’s done an outstanding job of holding Hekia Parata to account on behalf of parents and their children.</p>

<p>“Other newcomers to the top 20 include Andrew Little who is taking on Justice and will mark the Prime Minister in the Tourism portfolio. Megan Woods picks up Tertiary Education and has roles in Science and Innovation and Christchurch transport issues.</p>
<p>“Sue Moroney has deservedly earned her return to the top 20 with her strong performance on the paid parental leave campaign and in early childhood education. She’ll also take on the big job of ACC.</p>
<p>“Shane Jones’ position remains unchanged. He has a place held for him on the front bench contingent on the Auditor-General’s final report. He is a talented politician with an important contribution to make.</p>
<p>“I’m proud to lead this new team on the road to 2014. Labour will offer Kiwis a clear choice for change and a new direction for New Zealand.</p>
