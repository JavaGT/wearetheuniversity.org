<p><strong>Former UC guest lecturer and artist-in-residence Ralph Hotere remembered</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>February 25, 2013</strong></p>
<p>The University of Canterbury (UC) is exhibiting some of its Ralph Hotere prints on campus this week in tribute to one of the greatest New Zealand artists who died at the weekend.</p>
<p>Hotere was widely regarded as one of New Zealand&#39;s most significant artists. He was a guest lecturer and artist-in-residence at UC in 1984 where he collaborated with several printmakers at the School of Fine Arts to produce a number of etchings and lithographs.</p>
<p>UC art collection curator Lydia Baxendell said today Hotere produced a number of his most known prints while at the UC School of Fine Arts.</p>
<p>``A number of our graduates will remember him during his posting to UC and they will feel honoured to have been taught by one of the finest artists of our time,’’ Baxendell said.</p>
<p>UC has nine Hotere works in its collection of more than 5000 works, which is one of the biggest collections of any university in New Zealand.</p>
