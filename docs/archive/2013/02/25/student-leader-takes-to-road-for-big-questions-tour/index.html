<p>Student Leader Takes to Road for Big Questions Tour</p>
<p>Pete Hodkinson, current president of the NZ Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA), begins a nationwide road trip this week to speak with students about some of the ‘Big Questions’ being consulted on with agencies such as the Constitutional Advisory Panel and the Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement Income.</p>
<p>“Students have been really encouraged by the way that the Panel and the Commission have sought to work with us, to engage in a serious discussion about topical issues that will affect them for the rest of their lives and that will shape our future society,” says Pete Hodkinson, NZUSA President.</p>
<p>“Topics like the types of constitutional change that could be possible in New Zealand over the next generation, and questions about what’s fair and what’s not fair when it comes to spreading the burden of paying to support an ageing population.</p>
<p>“Ensuring that students have a voice in debates of such national importance, as they should, is a universal priority for our members this year. This is a year in which we will be striving to ensure that all students across all campuses get their voice back and are listened to, across all of the issues that matter to students – in an organised, structured, independent and representative way”.</p>
<p>Peter Hodkinson’s road trip will begin in Invercargill, travel north to Auckland and end in Wellington with Big Question focus workshops being held as follows:</p>
<p>* Dunedin - Tuesday 26 February: Otago University Students’ Association</p>
<p>* Christchurch - Thursday 28 February: Lincoln University Students’ Association</p>
<p>* Auckland - Monday 4 March: Auckland University Students’ Association</p>
<p>* Rotorua - Wednesday 6 March: Waiariki Institute of Technology Students’ Association</p>
<p>* Wellington - Friday 8 March: Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association</p>
