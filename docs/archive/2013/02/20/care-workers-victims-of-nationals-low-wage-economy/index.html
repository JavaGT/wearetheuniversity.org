<p><strong>Care Workers Victims of National’s Low Wage Economy</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is dismayed that the Government is refusing to increase the pay of thousands of residential aged care staff.</p>
<p>The Health Select Committee has just released a report which ignored the calls from more than 10,000 people for proper funding of the aged care sector.</p>
<p>Health spokesperson Barbara Stewart says New Zealand First holds serious concerns over the Government’s unfair treatment of residential aged care workers.</p>
<p>“As part of New Zealand First’s 2005 confidence and supply agreement with Labour we boosted funding by $580 million over the next two budgets.</p>
<p>“But post-2008 and National ignored the sector and failed to inflation-adjust the increase New Zealand First worked so hard to get.”</p>
<p>Mrs Stewart says for the Government to continue ignoring calls for care workers to get a pay increase is inexcusable given that thousands of workers are currently underpaid, and the workforce is predicted to double over the next decade.</p>
<p>“It is yet another example of the Government showing disregard for working New Zealanders by turning our country into a low-wage economy,” says Mrs Stewart.</p>
