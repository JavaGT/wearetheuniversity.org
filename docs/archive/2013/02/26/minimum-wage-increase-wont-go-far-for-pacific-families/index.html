<p>Su’a William Sio<br>Pacific Island Affairs Spokesperson</p>
<p>26 February 2013</p>
<p><strong>Minimum wage increase won’t go far for Pacific families</strong></p>
<p>National’s measly 25 cents an hour increase to the Minimum Wage does not give hope to those on low incomes, says Labour’s Pacific Island Affairs Spokesperson Su’a William Sio.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately for low income earners an extra ten bucks a week -- less tax-- is not going to go far.</p>
<p>“National has again shown only a token interest in lifting wages. It has given up on closing the wage gap with Australia and is abandoning thousands of families to a life of hardship.</p>
<p>“Four out of ten of the Kiwi children living in poverty come from working families. Today’s announcement gives them little relief.</p>
<p>“Struggling workers, especially those in the Pacific community, have embraced the Living Wage campaign because they know it will make a material difference in meeting soaring food, petrol and power bills.</p>
<p>“Labour would lift the minimum wage to $15 an hour immediately. That would put an extra $50 a week in the pockets of full-time minimum wage workers, and make a real difference to their lives.</p>
<p>“We are also getting in behind the campaign for a living wage of $18.40 an hour. That would buy families the basics they need.</p>
<p>“This Government has consistently failed the most vulnerable in our society. For Pacific families this is more of the same,” Su’a William Sio said.</p>
