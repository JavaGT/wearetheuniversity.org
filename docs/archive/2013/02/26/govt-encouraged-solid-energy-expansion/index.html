<p>**Govt Encouraged Solid Energy’s Expansion But Never Required A Business Case<br>**<br>The National Government encouraged Solid Energy expansion plans but never required it to submit a business case for its ambitious but ultimately futile $2 billion lignite developments, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>Information released under the Official Information Act confirms that Solid Energy never provided a business case for the proposed multi-billion dollar lignite expansion to Treasury or the shareholding ministers.</p>
<p>“The National Government failed to provide adequate oversight of the ambitious expansion plans of the state’s coal miner,” said Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman.</p>
<p>“The shareholding ministers and Treasury’s Crown Ownership Monitoring Unit are responsible for providing this oversight but they manifestly failed.</p>
<p>“But more than that, John Key was actively encouraging the expansion of Solid Energy’s lignite plans.”</p>
<p>John Key said to an Invercargill audience on 3 June, 2011 that, ‘At the moment companies like Solid Energy are growth companies and we want them to expand in areas like lignite conversion’.</p>
<p>“It is desperate stuff to now blame Solid Energy’s failings on a speech from Trevor Mallard in 2007,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“Like South Canterbury Finance before it, the National Government’s complacency has cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>“National is failing at the basics of good economic management and oversight.”</p>

<p>Dr Norman also questioned the Government’s attempt to paint Solid Energy’s demise as a failure of its clean energy investments.</p>
<p>“The majority of Solid Energy’s asset write-downs (or impairments) were dominated by its investments in underground mines, as reported by Solid Energy’s CEO when presenting the 2012 Annual Report,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“The closure of the Huntly and Spring Creek mines as a result of falling coal prices and the high New Zealand dollar have had a disproportionately bigger negative impact on Solid Energy’s bottom line than its investments in clean energy.</p>
<p>“In fact, the National Government’s decision to end the Biodiesel Grant then remove minimum biofuel requirements destroyed the business case for Solid Energy’s prior investment in biodiesel.”</p>
