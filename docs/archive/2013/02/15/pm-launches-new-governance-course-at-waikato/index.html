<p><strong>PM Launches New Governance Course At Waikato University</strong></p>
<p><strong>A new postgraduate qualification, targeted at directors of New Zealand companies, was officially launched today by Prime Minister John Key at the University of Waikato.</strong></p>
<p>The University of Waikato’s Management School and Te Piringa - Faculty of Law have worked together with the NZ Institute of Directors to develop the Governance and Leadership Programme, which is a Postgraduate Certificate specially designed for company directors, board members, trustees and councilors.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Key was delighted by the university’s initiative. “Waikato University produces world-class graduates that are making an enormous contribution all over New Zealand. Waikato is absolutely doing the right thing and I wish them all the best.”</p>
<p>Highlighting recent events, Mr Key said all too often businesses blame market forces or the government for its financial failure. “But all too often poor governance is to blame for a business falling over.”</p>
<p>“Governance is vitally important for the success of any organisation. It doesn’t matter whether it is a business, government or even a school, it all starts at the top. We need to produce our own successful business leaders if we are to succeed on the world stage.”</p>
<p>Mr Key said it is important for directors to understand their roles and responsibilities. “They represent the shareholders and their interests, and they must govern ethically and responsibly.”</p>

<p>University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says headlines around the world suggest many organisations don’t understand the vital role governance plays, “And that is no different in New Zealand. This course is in direct response to the needs of the New Zealand business community and its introduction is both timely and important.”</p>
<p>The Institute of Directors (IoD) has been involved in creating the programme and says the course complements its own director development programme. IoD Vice-President Stuart McLauchlan says directors need to be seen as professionals. “Recently we have seen a lot of New Zealand companies collapse and as a result seen many directors face prosecution. This course will go a long way to address these obvious needs. We are delighted to congratulate the University of Waikato on this initiative.”</p>
<p>The nine-month programme will be taught by staff from the Waikato Management School and Te Piringa - Faculty of Law and will cover finance, corporate law, ethics, governance, strategy and leadership. Participants will also complete a final project on their own organisation. The first intake takes place on 1 April.</p>
