<p><strong>Green Party Supports Living Wage</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party is calling on the Government to follow the lead of conservative politicians like London Mayor Boris Johnson and adopt a living wage for all Government employees and contractors.</p>
<p>The launch today of a campaign for employers to sign up to a living wage of $18.40 for their employees is supported by the Green Party who believes central and local Government and profitable employers should be the first to sign up.</p>
<p>“The Government can use its power as a large employer to make a radical improvement to the lives of thousands of low paid employees and contractors by guaranteeing them a living wage,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>“A true living wage gives low paid New Zealanders the opportunity to lead a good life and offers them and their family a shot at a fair future.</p>
<p>“This issue is not a left versus right one. The conservative Mayor of London Boris Johnson has championed the living wage and British Prime Minister David Cameron has also voiced support.</p>
<p>“It is unethical that any person working for the Government earns less than the minimum required to live a basic existence.</p>
<p>“It is time for John Key to offer low paid Government workers and their families a truly brighter future.</p>
<p>“A living wage makes economic sense. It reduces the need for other Government transfers and empowers workers.</p>
<p>“A living wage will help to close the wage gap with Australia and can help stop the exodus of Kiwis looking for better wages overseas.</p>

<p>“A living wage is achievable, for the Government and profitable employers it is simply a matter of priority and choice.</p>
<p>“Many Chief Executives in the public sector earn salaries of more than $300,000 while those that clean and maintain their buildings subsist on the minimum wage. We can pay decent wages when we choose to.</p>
<p>“This issue should not be characterised as a choice between wages and jobs. Profitable employers could sign up today without having to cut a single job.</p>
<p>“Many employers, such as those in the banking sector, are currently making good profits, yet their cleaners would earn less than a living wage.</p>
<p>“Profitable employers, especially those who send big dividends offshore each year, need to make a bigger commitment to New Zealand and local workers by signing up to a living wage now.”</p>
