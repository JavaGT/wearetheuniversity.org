<p>Clayton<br>COSGROVE<br>Spokesperson for SOEs<br>14 February 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Contact cuts show SOE sales pure idiocy</strong>  </p>
<p>Contact Energy’s decision to cut 100 employees because the electricity market is flat shows the Government’s push to sell two state-owned electricity companies this year is just plain stupid, says Labour’s SOEs spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
<p>“Contact Energy is cutting jobs and $40 million in spending because the electricity market is so flat. Putting a company on the market when demand for its product is low is madness. Yet this Government wants to sell two electricity companies this year.</p>
<p>“This Government clearly doesn’t understand basic supply and demand. Selling state assets is economic idiocy in the first place but selling when demand is flat would have school-age economics students scratching their heads.</p>
<p>“These cuts are proof that selling shares in our state assets is a big mistake as they will quickly be sold offshore. Contact is predominantly foreign owned and its overseas shareholders aren’t worried about Kiwi workers, they just want a good return.</p>
<p>“Over 370,000 New Zealanders have signed a petition to halt asset sales. The Government needs to listen to public and economic reason,” says Clayton Cosgrove.  </p>
