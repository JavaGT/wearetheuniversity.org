<p><strong>Tuesday, 12 February 2013, 5:06 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Su’a William<br>SIO<br>Employment Spokesperson</p>
<p>12 February 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Kiwis want jobs, not excuses</strong></p>
<p>Steven Joyce can blame officials all he likes for National’s promise to create 170,000 new jobs, but the fact remains that as Employment Minister he sat back and watched 30,000 jobs disappear from the economy last year, says Su’a William Sio.</p>
<p>In Parliament this afternoon Steven Joyce tried to deflect questions about National’s election promise of 170,000 new jobs over four years by saying that was a Treasury forecast.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce might think blaming Treasury gets him off the hook, but it doesn’t. National campaigned on creating new jobs, but instead the workforce has shrunk. That’s not the brighter future John Key promised New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“National is in complete denial about the scale of the unemployment problem facing this country. 163,000 Kiwis are looking for work – they are not looking for more excuses from the Government.</p>
<p>“We can’t afford to sit back and watch as tens-of-thousands of people give up on the labour force. We should never accept an unemployment rate of 30% for 15 to 19-year-olds, 14.8% for Māori and 16% for Pasifika.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce should just come clean with New Zealanders and admit that the Government has no idea how to create jobs.</p>
<p>“It’s time for fresh thinking, and for a hands-on Government that will make job creation a priority,” says Su’a William Sio.</p>
