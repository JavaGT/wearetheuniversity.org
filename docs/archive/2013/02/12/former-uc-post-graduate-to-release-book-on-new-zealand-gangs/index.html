<p><strong>Former UC Post-Graduate To Release Book On New Zealand Gangs</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>February 12, 2013</strong></p>
<p>A former University of Canterbury (UC) postgraduate student will, later next month, release a book about the history of New Zealand gangs.</p>
<p>The book, Patched, has been written by Dr Jarrod Gilbert who had his PhD studies at UC supervised by one of New Zealand’s leading criminologists, Professor Greg Newbold.</p>
<p>``It is the result of almost a decade of intensive research into gangs, which involved Jarrod spending years getting to know certain key gang members and eventually being accepted by the gangs concerned,’’ Professor Newbold said today.</p>
<p>``Jarrod spent large amounts of time on gang territory and socialising with gang members from well-known clubs such as the Mongrel Mob, the Hell’s Angels and the Devil’s Henchmen. He spent smaller amounts of time in the company of other gangs as well.</p>
<p>``In doing so, Jarrod was given access to material and information never before accessed by any New Zealand researcher. Indeed his findings, in terms of depth, breadth and understanding, are unique in the history of gang research.’’</p>
<p>The sources of information which inform the book are not restricted to gangs. Gilbert also spoke to police and other officials involved in gang intelligence and read almost every book and article published about New Zealand gangs since they began in the 1950s. He also read the vast amount of international literature on gangs that dates back to the 1920s.</p>

<p>Dr Gilbert studied how gangs developed both internationally and within New Zealand, and examined the numerous social and policing initiatives that have been developed to try to control them, Professor Newbold said.</p>
<p>``Through his work, Jarrod has acquired a profound and encyclopaedic knowledge about gangs in this country. Nobody has a deeper or more comprehensive understanding of New Zealand gangs than he has. This book, written by the country’s foremost gang expert, will be of immense value to all who wish to understand gangs, where they come from, how they operate, and the place they have in New Zealand society.’’</p>
<p>The book will be launched at UC’s School of Law on March 22.</p>
