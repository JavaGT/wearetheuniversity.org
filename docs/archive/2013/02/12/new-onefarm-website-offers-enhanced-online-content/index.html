<p><strong>Tuesday, 12 February 2013, 4:49 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University">Massey University</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, February 12, 2013</strong><br><strong>New OneFarm website offers enhanced online content</strong></p>
<p>Farmers and agricultural professionals will be able to connect with one another and view exclusive content through a new online service.</p>
<p><em>OneFarm: the Centre of Excellence in Farm Business Management</em> has upgraded its website to include a number of new features that promote knowledge exchange and community.</p>
<p>OneFarm’s Tom Phillips says the new website is a place where people can engage in conversations about the rural sector.</p>
<p>“We want people to participate in conversations about the issues that affect them,” he says. “Rural professionals are often separated by physical distance, so the site gives them the opportunity to connect easily.”</p>
<p>As well as discussion forums, the site will also stream webinars from leading rural professionals, academics, and other agricultural leaders. The first of these will be held this month.</p>
<p>To view the OneFarm webinars people must be registered at the site: onefarm.ac.nz.</p>
<p>Next month, the site will stream two webinars from Massey University’s Central Districts Field Days site.</p>
<p>In the first, Associate Professor in Farm and Agribusiness Management Nicola Shadbolt will speak on Thursday, March 7 at 11am on <em>Farm Business Resilience in Turbulent Times</em>.</p>
<p>Then on Friday, March 8 at 11am, ANZ chief economist Cameron Bagrie will talk on <em>Current Economic Factors Likely to Impact on NZ Dairy Farmers</em>.</p>
<p>The Centre of Excellence in Farm Business Management is a joint venture by Lincoln and Massey universities, with the support of DairyNZ and the Government through the Primary Growth Partnership.<br>It combines capability from both universities and co-ordinates the supply of research, education and professional development to meet the agriculture industry’s needs.</p>
