<p>18 February 2013</p>
<p><strong>Distinguished Pianist Kicks Off Recital Series</strong>  </p>
<p>Pianist Michael Houstoun will play the first of this year’s lunchtime concerts at the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>Houstoun, a household name in New Zealand since the beginning of his successful international career in the 1980s, will perform J S Bach’s <em>Goldberg</em> Variations at the Academy of Performing Arts on Wednesday 27 February.</p>
<p>It’s a work that many pianists aspire to in their careers and Houstoun says the masterpiece requires immense stamina and concentration. “It’s 30 minutes longer than the next longest work in my repertoire!</p>
<p>“The &#39;Goldberg&#39; Variations are more demanding than anything else written for keyboards in the 18th century, much harder than anything else J S Bach himself wrote.</p>
<p>“However, all these difficulties are nothing compared to the pleasure of playing such a magnificent masterpiece.”</p>
<p>The lunchtime recitals at the University of Waikato are hosted by the Conservatorium of Music. They are held every Wednesday and organised by lecturer and concert pianist, Katherine Austin.</p>
<p>“We are incredibly honoured to have Michael, by far New Zealand’s most celebrated concert pianist, open the recital concerts for us,” says Austin.</p>
<p>The concerts are open to the public for a small donation and the 2013 series will see a large variety of musical talent - national and international performers - plus staff and students from the Conservatorium of Music.</p>
<p>On the first Wednesday in March, singers Dame Malvina Major and David Griffiths are joined by the New Zealand Chamber Soloists, for a concert of opera gems and piano trios.</p>
<p>The concerts are held in the Concert Chamber at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts, every Wednesday at 1pm. A $5 donation gains entry to Michael Houstoun’s performance on Wednesday 27 February.</p>
