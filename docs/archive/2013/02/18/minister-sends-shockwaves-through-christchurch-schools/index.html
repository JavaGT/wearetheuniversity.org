<p><strong>Minister Sends Shockwaves through Christchurch Schools</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is urging the 19 Christchurch schools still slated to close or merge to keep up the fight to save their communities.</p>
<p>The Education Minister has announced today that seven Christchurch schools will close and 12 will merge as part of the Government&#39;s education shake-up in the post-quake city.</p>
<p>Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says she feels for all those connected with each school – the students, teachers, parents and the wider school communities.</p>
<p>“While today’s announcement is good news for those which will remain open, it is heart breaking for the seven schools which are closing and lumps even more uncertainty on those whose fate remains up in the air.</p>
<p>“These schools stood by their communities following the devastation of the earthquakes and what a shame the Government hasn’t chosen to stand by them.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Minister&#39;s banking on the school community having a short memory come election time, she should think again.</p>
<p>“Schools won&#39;t forget the scars National is etching into communities but the battle isn’t over yet.</p>
<p>“Schools still have another six weeks to lodge submissions and even though today’s announcement has left them shell-shocked I’d encourage them to stay strong,” says Ms Martin.</p>
