<p>“I am looking for an exceptional young person who is willing to get out and engage with the youth in our communities, gather their views and represent them in Parliament.</p>
<p>“If successful, this person will join 120 other Youth MPs from all over New Zealand when they take over New Zealand’s Parliament on 16 and 17 July.</p>

<p>Mr Lotu-Iiga further advises that, in addition to nominations from secondary schools, in recognition of young people who may be suitable for nomination but not currently in the secondary schooling system, there will also be opportunity to submit an application through the Electorate Office, for consideration to compete against the other nominated students.</p>
