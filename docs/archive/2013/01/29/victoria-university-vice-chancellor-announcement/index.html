<p><strong>Tuesday, 29 January 2013, 11:53 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Victoria University Vice-Chancellor announcement</strong></p>
<p>The Chancellor of Victoria University, Ian McKinnon, announced today that Professor Pat Walsh will not be seeking a third term as Vice-Chancellor when his current term concludes at the end of this year.</p>
<p>Mr McKinnon noted the considerable success achieved by Victoria during the period Professor Walsh has been Vice-Chancellor.</p>
<p>“As Vice-Chancellor, Professor Walsh has recognised the role of the University in the capital city, while also ensuring that Victoria has developed strong relationships internationally, including establishing a number of memoranda of understanding with partner universities around the world.”</p>
<p>Mr McKinnon said Professor Walsh deserves great credit for the University&#39;s position today.</p>
<p>“Victoria University is offering a first-class university education led by outstanding research active staff as well as an outstanding student experience, and considerable credit must be given to Professor Walsh for the University&#39;s position today.</p>
<p>“The number of students attending Victoria has increased and the University has had to manage the challenges that this brings—not simply in the necessary expansion of facilities, such as the new student Campus Hub and the state-of-the-art Alan MacDiarmid Building, but also in the development of its teaching, learning and research initiatives.</p>
<p>“His leadership has been well focused and he is certainly able to reflect on a period in which he has added considerably to the standing of Victoria.</p>

<p>“The University Council has greatly valued Professor Walsh&#39;s time in office, just as the University, its staff and students, has benefitted from these eight years,” Mr McKinnon said.</p>
<p>Professor Walsh said he has found the role challenging, stimulating and enormously rewarding.</p>
<p>“It has been an honour and a privilege to be Victoria’s Vice-Chancellor since 2005. I have been inspired on a daily basis by my first-hand knowledge of the many extraordinary achievements of our staff and students,” he said.</p>
<p>“During my time at Victoria I have seen many changes and faced many challenges but I am immensely proud of our achievements. Victoria University staff and students continue to excel in the creation and dissemination of knowledge that enriches our society.”</p>
<p>The University will shortly begin the process of finding a successor.</p>
