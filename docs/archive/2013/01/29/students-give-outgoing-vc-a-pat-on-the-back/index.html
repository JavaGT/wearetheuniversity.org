<p><strong>Students give outgoing VC a Pat on the back</strong>  </p>
<p>In response to today’s unexpected announcement by Professor Pat Walsh that he will not be seeking a third term as Vice-Chancellor, Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) would like express our thanks to Professor Walsh, for his hard work and commitment to our university community.</p>
<p>VUWSA President Rory McCourt said that Professor Walsh’s tenure marked a large improvement to the University’s engagement with students and that VUWSA has greatly valued his time in office.</p>
<p>“Professor Walsh’s leadership style meant that he has always been prepared to listen to the ideas of others, and in particular to the feedback and input of students through VUWSA.</p>
<p>“I hope Professor Walsh’s successor can live up to his high standards of engagement with students and build even stronger partnerships that can attract and retain talented students and graduates here in Wellington,” said Mr McCourt.</p>
<p>Professor Walsh will see out his term in 2013, while the University will appoint a new Vice-Chancellor for 2014.</p>
<p>“I look forward to continuing the close working relationship VUWSA has with the Vice-Chancellor in 2013 as we respond together to the challenges and opportunities facing students at Victoria.</p>
<p>“We wish Professor Walsh well for the future,” said Mr McCourt.<br><strong>ENDS</strong></p>
