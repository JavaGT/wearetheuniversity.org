<p><strong>Tuesday, 29 January 2013, 3:12 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong><br>New Zealand First Leader<br>29 January 2013  </p>
<p><strong>Reply To The Prime Minister’s Statement</strong></p>
<p>Mr Speaker –</p>
<p>Sometimes we have the privilege of watching a great political event unfold.</p>
<p>Sometimes we hear a speaker inspire us with a great vision.</p>
<p>Sometimes a great leader shows us the way to a better and brighter future for our country.</p>
<p>Sadly - we’ve missed out on all three today.</p>
<p>The best part of the Prime Minister’s speech today was the part where - he sat down.</p>
<p>The rest of it consisted of the same old same old neo-liberal/free market pixie dust.</p>
<p>It sounded like he wrote it in the shower or in Antarctica or somewhere.</p>
<p>The philosophy behind it goes something like this:</p>
<p>1. Flog off the country to overseas investors.<br>2. Create a currency speculators paradise.<br>3. Change the labour laws again to kick the workers in the guts.<br>4. Cut government services.<br>5. Starve the regions.<br>6. Subsidise overseas businesses, like Warner Brothers, and ignore opportunities to keep New Zealand enterprises going back home.<br>7. And when in doubt build another motorway!!!<br>New Zealand’s great leaders were once people of vision.</p>
<p>They didn’t spend their lives gazing into a computer screen.</p>
<p>They surrounded themselves with like-minded individuals.</p>
<p>They wanted to make life better for their people.</p>
<p>Their vision was of an independent nation, making its own way in the world using New Zealand resources with educated and skilled people – who could expect some sort of fulfilment and satisfaction.</p>
<p>We led the world with our social justice – our care of the young and the old – and the guiding principle was that simple expression – “We have to give them a fair go”.</p>
<p>That noble concept of a fair go for all was the first casualty of the neoliberalism practised by the political Neanderthals who have polluted this country since 1984.</p>
<p>What we have now is a government that governs by photo opportunities, sound bites and spin doctoring. And seldom in our history has a government assumed such an air of lofty arrogance in so short a time.</p>
<p>There is no engine room of ideas, policies, plans or perceptions.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister – who is supposed to be a smart guy – cannot understand the single biggest problem this country faces.</p>
<p>That is that we cannot earn enough money to make our way in the world because our currency is over-valued.</p>
<p>It is out of control and every exporter and manufacturer knows this.</p>
<p>The world’s best performing economies know this.</p>
<p>But here we have an original thinker in Steven Joyce proclaiming that “he feels the currency will come down a bit”.</p>
<p>He says it’s a fool’s paradise to intervene in the exchange rate.</p>
<p>Yeah right – look at these graphs.</p>
<p>They paint a stark picture.</p>
<p>Here is export profitability.</p>
<p><img src="http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1301/5b4f5057c35ad1cab676.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>And here is the NZ dollar to US dollar exchange rate.</p>
<p><img src="http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1301/f6886590fc360c8f2e4b.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>It is clear.</p>
<p>As the exchange rate goes up our earnings as a country go down.</p>
<p>Yet we have Mr Joyce dismissing leaders of the manufacturing and export sector who yesterday testified to the damage that a chronically overvalued dollar is causing.</p>
<p>Who has credibility? The serious people who are actually running business in a highly competitive world or a Minister out of ideas but who is too arrogant to consider he may be wrong.</p>
<p>We need policies for this decade, not policies stuck in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Where does the National party find these people?</p>
<p>We in New Zealand First will not accept defeat over this issue.</p>
<p>Mr Key and his colleagues are strangling our manufacturers and exporters.</p>
<p>Mr Key and his colleagues are sentencing them to commercial extinction with a massively overvalued dollar.</p>
<p>All manner of experts from the IMF downwards confirm this.</p>
<p>But no, the National Party know better.</p>
<p>For Mr Key’s Government is about working for currency speculators.</p>
<p>It is not working for real people.</p>
<p>This is a government of currency speculators by currency speculators for currency speculators.</p>
<p>Although our Reserve Bank Bill missed out by one vote – we will be resubmitting our Bill shortly because action on the dollar is imperative if we are to save what remains of our manufacturing base.</p>
<p>In the halcyon days of New Zealand’s economic prosperity our manufacturing was more than 30 per cent of our GDP.</p>
<p>Today it is less than 13 per cent and falling.</p>
<p>We know there are some nervous nellies amongst National backbenchers.</p>
<p>Some of them are from the regions that supply our export wealth – such as it is.</p>
<p>Talk to them about their regions. They know what’s happening.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker the countries that are doing well have a common theme and that is that they manage their economies.</p>
<p>They don’t allow the financial markets and the banks to take control of their economic destiny.</p>
<p>More than anyone else, Mr Key knows what caused the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>Or to be more accurate, the Western Financial Crisis.</p>
<p>Mr Key even knew some of the people involved because he used to work with them.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker we are not in Parliament just to point out the flaws in the government’s policies (or lack of them).</p>
<p>Nor are we here to heap scorn on those individuals who were obviously cut out for some other vocation than to persecute humanity as members of parliament.</p>
<p>We in New Zealand First promised to be constructive and we want to give the government some kind of guidance for the year ahead.</p>
<p>Current policies are stabbing the heart of the heartland.</p>
<p>Provincial regions create our wealth but this is not recognised by this government.</p>
<p>Some regions are in trouble. Their government services are being cut back all the time.</p>
<p>And guess what? Mr Key is going to keep cutting!</p>
<p>There are rising unemployment, law and order problems and there is a lack of opportunity for youth in the regions.</p>
<p>The picture painted in the beehive is very different from the reality on the ground.</p>
<p>And what about the rail links?</p>
<p>The Napier-Gisborne line gone with the stroke of a pen for want of a few million dollars.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker – we are not here today to just criticise – even though it is justified.</p>
<p>We have ideas and we will work with the government to implement policies that train our young people and create jobs.</p>
<p>We have an overview.</p>
<p>We look at the big picture.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of talk about the sustainability of superannuation and coping with an ageing population.</p>
<p>Well, New Zealand First is not fooled on this issue, and we do have a plan.</p>
<p>We are going to release policies this year that cover all aspects of this demographic change.</p>
<p>We don’t see senior citizens as a problem.</p>
<p>We celebrate age and wisdom and might we say there should be a bit more of it around here for we are sick of inexperience learning on the job.</p>
<p>We value experience.</p>
<p>For example, would experience have landed us with the disaster that is Novopay?</p>
<p>Our policies include superannuation eligibility, health, power costs, eldercare and employment.</p>
<p>The present approach is too piecemeal.</p>
<p>We are confident the social/demographic change can be managed with the right attitude.</p>
<p>And a change in attitude is needed over immigration.</p>
<p>This is an on-going issue with further scams emerging all the time.</p>
<p>Christchurch is getting its own problems with underpaid immigrant workers being poured in illegally.</p>
<p>There is continued abuse of the student visa scheme.</p>
<p>The doors to our country are wide open and this is not acceptable.</p>
<p>And a warning to all members in this House.</p>
<p>A political bushfire will rage across the country this year over our beaches and seabed.</p>
<p>This season might be the last that Kiwis enjoy free access to their favourite beaches.</p>
<p>The Government is negotiating away control to Iwi groups under the guise of customary title.</p>
<p>This is a ticking time-bomb allowing iwi privatisation of beaches and seabed, at any time in the future.</p>
<p>We know of about 22 claims to 900 kilometres of coastline and about 4500 square kilometres of seabed – many in prime locations.</p>
<p>We are sure that many more claims are in the pipeline but there is a wall of silence despite the intense public interest.</p>
<p>And we will be vigilant with regard to the Constitutional Review which we know has a secret agenda to make the Treaty of Waitangi the cornerstone of our democracy.</p>
<p>And of course Whānau Ora will continue to appease the Maori Party but they are pakaru!</p>
<p>And what about housing?</p>
<p>The rental situation is overloaded.</p>
<p>Rents are sky high and getting worse.</p>
<p>There is not enough housing stock and Auckland is a property speculators’ paradise, including, now, many foreign speculators in housing real estate.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker there is another area where the government has its head firmly in the sand and that is the forthcoming diabetes problem.</p>
<p>The health system won’t be able to cope.</p>
<p>Something has to be done now.</p>
<p>We in New Zealand First don’t believe in totalitarian food control.</p>
<p>But we have to reduce the amount of fat, sugar and salt being devoured by Kiwis.</p>
<p>We will work with anyone prepared to grasp this nettle.</p>
<p>At the start of 2013 New Zealand is faced by a range of critical issues that I have outlined today.</p>
<p>A government that is incapable or unwilling to consider all options with the best interests of all New Zealanders at heart has no right to govern.</p>
<p>This is not a government for New Zealanders.</p>
<p>It is serving special interests, mainly in the world of big business.</p>
<p>Whether it be Warner Brothers, Sky City or China Southern Airlines the pattern is clear.</p>
<p>That pattern is backroom deals leading to special favours at great cost to the long term interests of ordinary Kiwis.</p>
<p>These were the people who asked New Zealand First to look after them.</p>
<p>And that is what we will be doing in 2013!  </p>
