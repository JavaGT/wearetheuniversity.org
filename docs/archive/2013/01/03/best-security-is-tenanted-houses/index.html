<p><strong>Best security is tenanted houses</strong></p>
<p>Housing New Zealand is wasting millions of dollars of taxpayer’s money on security guards and cleaning up after vandals, when the best way to protect its properties is to put tenants in them, says Annette King.</p>
<p>The government’s housing agency has resorted to boarding up empty state houses in the Hutt Valley, and has previously confirmed it pays security companies to monitor empty properties.</p>
<p>“Empty houses are any easy target for vandals. Surely the best possible way to protect a house is to have someone living in it?</p>
<p>“Housing New Zealand has thousands of peoples on its books desperate to get into a home. Rather than throwing money away on security guards, it should start filling up its empty stock.</p>
<p>“Housing New Zealand kept far too many properties empty in 2012 waiting for the Housing Minister Phil Heatley to give it clear directions. He’s been in the job four years – it is about time he started to pull his finger out.</p>
<p>“It is simply crazy to leave so many state houses empty. They should be used for the purpose they were built for – to house New Zealanders in need,” says Annette King.</p>
