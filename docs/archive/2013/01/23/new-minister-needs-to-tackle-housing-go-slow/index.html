<p>23 January 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>New Minister needs to tackle housing go-slow</strong>  </p>
<p>Incoming Housing Minister Nick Smith has a lot of work to do if he wants to convince Kiwis housing affordability is a priority for National says Labour’s Housing spokesperson Annette King.</p>
<p>“Nick Smith has shown little vigour for tackling housing affordability today, trotting out the same tired arguments that saw Phil Heatley get the sack.</p>
<p>“We know that sections are in short supply – most of us can’t afford to buy one.</p>
<p>“We know that the cost of materials is steep – we’ve got friends in Oz building homes cheaper.</p>
<p>“We know that there is a mountain of bureaucratic red tape – most of us aren’t in a position to wade through it.</p>
<p>“With the average house price now close to $400,000, scraping together a deposit is near impossible. Already, hundreds of thousands of aspiring Kiwi homeowners have resigned themselves to renting for life.</p>
<p>“Renting should be a choice, not an inevitability.</p>
<p>“Unless Nick Smith offers up some actual solutions, any momentum National might have gained with a Cabinet reshuffle will be wasted.</p>
<p>“Talking about compliance costs, ‘time-consuming processes’ and tinkering with the Resource Management Act won’t cut it.</p>
<p>“Labour understands that owning your own home is an aspiration akin to having a good job and raising kids for many New Zealanders. That’s why we have committed to build 100,000 modern affordable homes over 10 years.</p>
<p>“Labour has no-nonsense solutions – National just has nonsense,” Annette King said.</p>
