<p>HIPKINS</p>
<p>Acting Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>18 January 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Front-footing Novopay failure not the answer</strong>  </p>
<p>While problems with the Novopay system get worse rather than better, the Government is still missing in action, Labour’s Acting Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>“Today we’ve got the Ministry of Education telling thousands of school staff to prepare for the worst, even though they’ve supposedly spent months ‘fixing’ the problems with Novopay.</p>
<p>“Front-footing future failures won’t win the Ministry any friends. Most of us had hoped it couldn’t get much worse – that was obviously tempting fate.</p>
<p>“While the Novopay shambles continues to roll on, John Key’s ‘smooth’ operator - Education Minister Hekia Parata - is incommunicado. Her Associate Craig Foss is nowhere to be seen either.</p>
<p>“National has had months to sort out this mess, yet they continue to take the hands-off approach that got them into trouble in the first place.</p>
<p>“Last year the courts told the Education Minister she was abdicating her responsibilities as a decision maker when it came to the closure of special residential schools. Well, she is abdicating her responsibilities when it comes to ensuring people get paid on time too.</p>
<p>“If this is the level of accountability John Key is willing to accept from his ministers his government will join him on thin ice,” Chris Hipkins said.</p>
