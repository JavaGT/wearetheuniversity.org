<p><strong>Thursday, January 10, 2013</strong><br><strong>New science labs blessed in dawn ceremony at Albany</strong></p>
<p>A dawn ceremony blessing the new Student Central Science Labs was held at the Albany Campus on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The blessing was led by Haahi Walker (Ngāti Whātua o Kaipara kaumātua) with support from his daughter Rita and Glen Willcox, and included a tour through the two-storey building.</p>
<p>Head of the Institute of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Distinguished Professor Gaven Martin says the new labs will provide a great environment for undergraduate science students to learn in.</p>
<p>“These facilities are state-of-the-art and will support Massey’s many innovative programmes both in the new College of Heath and in the College of Sciences – it’s just great space and staff are really looking forward to getting in there and getting going. It’s a great way to start the year,” he says.</p>
<p>The new labs back on to the original Student Central building, which was officially opened in March 2012. The entire facility, with the addition of the labs, cost just over $21 million and it’s an investment Professor Martin says is essential to support the growing Albany campus.</p>
<p>The ground floor houses three physics teaching labs and an equipment room, with one lab able to be transformed into a completely dark environment for optics experiments. It is also home to technicians and tutors who will teach in the labs.</p>
<p>The second level has four biology labs of varying sizes with moveable walls to allow for changes in class sizes, and includes the latest ventilation technology and in-room bio-hazard showers.</p>
<p>An official opening ceremony for the building will be held when students are on campus.</p>
