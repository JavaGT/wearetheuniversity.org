<p><strong>Centre for Strategic Studies Ranks Third In Global Ratings</strong>  </p>
<p>Victoria University’s Centre for Strategic Studies has been ranked third amongst think tanks in Asia by a prestigious global report.</p>
<p>The <em>2012 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report</em>, produced by the International Relations Program of the University of Pennsylvania, evaluates and ranks more than 5,000 think tanks across the world.</p>
<p>Thousands of international scholars, policymakers, journalists, government officials, donors and think tank executives provide peer and expert review to the indices.</p>
<p>The Centre for Strategic Studies (CSS) was ranked 30th best university affiliated think tank worldwide, and third in a new ‘Asia’ category alongside distinguished research institutes in Australia, Singapore and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Professor Robert Ayson, Director of the CSS, says he is thrilled that experts around the wider world have given the Centre such a high rating.</p>
<p>“This is a tribute to our efforts as a Centre with modest resourcing but an active agenda to make quality contributions to the strategic debates in the region. It also says something about the calibre of the international scholars we have been able to attract.</p>
<p>“To be ranked so highly amongst leading think tanks from such countries as Australia and Singapore is a sign of the Centre’s impact and profile in a very competitive region,” says Professor Ayson.</p>
