<p><strong><em>For immediate release</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Otago Students Earn over $8 Million in 2012</strong></p>
<p>Student Job Search figures released this week show Otago students earned over $8 Million through the service in 2012, up 15 percent to $8,051,814 from $6,991,091 in 2011. OUSA research backed up the figures with a 7 percent increase in student usage from 69 – 76 percent since 2010</p>
<p>“We’re absolutely rapped with the news that SJS has helped our students earn so much more”, said Francisco Hernandez, OUSA President, “With government support becoming tougher for students to gain every year, any extra money they can earn is really important.”</p>
<p>The slowing labour market in 2012 saw a decrease in placements. However, those finding work through the service were earning more with a 22 percent increase in earnings per placement since 2011 up to $1,848 during the 2012 year.</p>
<p>“For us it’s part of providing the services and facilities students really need”, said Hernandez, “We’ve worked with SJS to improve on-campus promotion, social media exposure and we spearheaded introducing free SJS kiosks in our offices so students can always access jobs when theyneed to.”</p>
<p>Student Job Search is a service governed by student associations around the country. It is free for businesses and individuals to use when searching for employees and free for students looking for work.</p>
