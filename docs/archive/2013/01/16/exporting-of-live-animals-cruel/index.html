<p>Exporting of live animals cruel</p>
<p>Exporting thousands of live animals is cruel and needs to be more tightly controlled, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>This was in response to the recent report of the shipment next week of 7,200 dairy cows from Timaru to China for dairying.</p>
<p>“The Government seems content to put thousands of animals through suffering by allowing their shipping overseas,” Green Party MP Julie Anne Genter said today.</p>
<p>“We can sell our good stock to other countries through exporting genetic material. We shouldn’t be sending the animals themselves,” said Ms Genter.</p>
<p>“The current review of the Animal Welfare Act must include stronger restrictions and a real focus on minimising exports of live animals.</p>
<p>“The criteria by which the Minister allows animals to be exported also need to include considerations about the ongoing welfare of animals in the importing country.</p>
<p>“Once these cows get to China, we have lost control of their welfare and how they will be treated.</p>
<p>“Mechanical or customs problems can even keep animals stuck on ships in terrible conditions. Last year 22,000 Australian sheep were stuck on a ship in the Persian Gulf for a fortnight after the cargo was rejected by Bahrain.</p>
<p>“In the current review of the Animal Welfare Act, the Government has proposed the long overdue development of enforceable standards for live animal exports. We support this proposal, but they need to also include a focus on reducing these cruel live exports,” said Ms Genter.</p>
