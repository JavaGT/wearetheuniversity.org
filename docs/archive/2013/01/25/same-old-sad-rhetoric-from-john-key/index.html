<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong><br>New Zealand First Leader<br>25 January 2013  </p>
<p><strong>Same Old Sad Rhetoric From John Key</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First says the Prime Minister’s State of the Nation speech was unable to conceal the National Government’s lack of a viable economic plan.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters says the murky vision in John Key’s address is staggering given that he had weeks of holiday time in Hawaii in which to come up with something of substance.</p>
<p>“This National-led Government is just tinkering with the economy as employment dries up and tens of thousands of New Zealanders each year abandon the country in search of a better future.</p>
<p>“This public malaise with the country is set to continue while the Government refuses to tackle our seriously overvalued dollar.</p>
<p>“They even have the gall to tell New Zealanders that they must live with our high dollar no matter the damage it inflicts upon them.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First backs moves to create more apprenticeships but the initiative announced today by the Government is two years too late. It should have happened soon after the Canterbury earthquakes.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says it is outrageous that Mr Key believes his dodgy backroom dealings with Sky City for a National Convention Centre is the best thing to promote high end tourism.</p>
<p>“Mr Key is the worst Minister of Tourism this country has seen in many years.</p>
<p>“If he believes that a convention centre is the focal point to increasing tourism then he is away with the fairies,” says Mr Peters.  </p>
