<p>Give Partnership Schools Kura Hourua Freedom And Accountability</p>
<p>“We all want to help pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. Partnership schools kura hourua could do this, as long as the Education Amendment Bill 2012 strikes the right balance between operational freedom for sponsors and accountability to the Crown,” says Maxim Institute researcher, Dr. Luke Fenwick.</p>
<p>Maxim Institute has made a submission supporting the Bill’s introduction of partnership schools kura hourua, with suggestions for improvement. “For example, to bolster accountability and public confidence we recommend the publication of performance indicators (and details of how operators track against these), as well as the application of the Ombudsmen Act 1975 and the Official Information Act 1982. We also a advise rigorous scientific evaluation of the pilot scheme to evaluate the impact of partnership schools kura hourua.”</p>
<p>For-profit operators should be welcomed, but safeguards would be sensible, such as imposing an “asset-lock” to prevent these providers from selling off any government-procured assets for a quick profit. This would help ensure the protection of taxpayers’ money when launching the scheme. “The opportunity for collaboration between sponsors and local communities in the for-profit model could offer real benefits for students, provided enough accountability measures are put in place,” says Dr. Fenwick.</p>
<p>“The introduction of appropriate amendments to the Bill or regulatory guidelines should help garner support for the initiative, and promote the conditions that will give partnership schools kura hourua the greatest chance to succeed.”</p>
