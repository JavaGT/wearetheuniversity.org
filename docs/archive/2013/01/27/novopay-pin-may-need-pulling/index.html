<p>Chris HIPKINS</p>
<p>Acting Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>27 January 2013                                                 </p>
<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Novopay pin may need pulling</strong></p>
<p>As fallout from the sow’s ear that is Novopay continues Steven Joyce should seriously consider pulling the pin on it, Labour’s Acting Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>“There are thousand, may be  tens of thousands, of people affected by this – if  they’re not facing huge and unwarranted tax bills, they have been assigned wrong salary grades, have lost benefits they are entitled to, or have had their student loan repayments ‘disappear’.</p>
<p>“Those aren’t just glitches; they are major, systemic problems and clearly show Novopay should never have been signed-off.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce definitely has his work cut out. Yes, he needs to ask some questions – tough ones - about its roll out and yes, he needs to look at its capability, but he also needs to be looking at alternative systems, given the possibility Novopay is beyond repair. .</p>
<p>“It’s six months since this issue first arose. Schools are just weeks away from the start of a new year and they still don’t have a working payroll. Staff have every right to be angry.</p>
<p>“If Mr Joyce can deliver a silk purse from a system that was never going to be anything more than a pig’s ear, then all credit to him.</p>
<p>“But if he finds he can’t stitch it together, he needs to find an alternative quick smart.” </p>
