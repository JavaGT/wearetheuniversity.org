<p><strong>Sunday, 27 January 2013, 1:35 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>MEDIA STATEMENT</strong><br> <br><strong>David Shearer: New Era - New Solutions</strong><br> <br>Labour Leader David Shearer has today set out the need for a new approach so that New Zealand has a smart hands-on government that backs hard-working Kiwis doing their bit.<br> <br>“New Zealanders are looking for a Government that will roll up its sleeves and back them. Kiwis are doing their bit, it’s time they had a Government that did its bit too.<br> <br>“The global economic landscape has changed as a result of the financial crisis. It’s not just a blip. National hasn’t woken up to that fact. Its hands off, leave it to the market approach, has failed. Too many people are being left behind.<br> <br>“Labour has the fresh thinking and new ideas needed to make a real difference to people’s lives. We recognise we are in a new era. We have the solutions and the courage to act. Labour will be a player not a spectator in government, said David Shearer.<br> <br>In his speech at Wainuiomata today, David Shearer set out Labour’s priorities for 2013.<br> <br>“Jobs are our number one priority. We have concrete ideas that will help, including creating thousands of jobs and training opportunities through our plan to put 100,000 families into affordable first homes,” he said.<br> <br>The Labour Leader also signalled key areas of new policy development that will be unveiled in 2013.</p>
<p>“Our economic team will develop a clear plan to diversify our economy. It’s about backing the talent of businesses working in high tech and the innovations of those adding value to our natural resources. A thriving manufacturing sector is at the heart of our vision.<br> <br>“On education, we’ll work to improve the transition from school to further training and high-skill jobs. Too many young Kiwis are dropping out or just drifting. We want every child to go through school with a purpose and a plan of where they’ll end up.<br> <br>“Our Social Development spokesperson will also produce an alternative white paper, setting out how we will help lift children out of poverty and give them the best start in life.<br> <br>“And we’ll be talking to Cantabrians about how they see their future. It’s about rebuilding Canterbury from the grassroots up, not the Beehive down. Their voices must be heard.<br> <br>“This is a big year for Labour – where we hold the Government to account and show New Zealanders that Labour is ready to govern,” said David Shearer.<br> <br>ENDS</p>
