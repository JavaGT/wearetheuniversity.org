<p><strong>Joyce Lets Teachers Down Again Over Novopay</strong></p>
<p>It is time for Government Ministers to become accountable for the Novopay fiasco says New Zealand First Education spokesperson Tracy Martin.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce has indicated that the Government is likely to stay with the $30 million Novopay system, which is cold comfort for the thousands of school employees around the country who have been struggling with Novopay’s errors for months.</p>
<p>“Education Minister Hekia Parata signed off on the system, which came with no back-up plan, on the advice of her associate Craig Foss who has somehow managed to keep his place in cabinet.</p>
<p>“It’s been a litany of monumental errors for the Government, yet Mr Joyce insists on persevering with what is clearly a nightmare for the education sector.</p>
<p>“Mr Joyce has stated that next week&#39;s pay round will be particularly challenging, but that’s not good enough.</p>
<p>“It’s time ministers in this Government started asking the right questions over the botched pay system and became accountable for their decisions,” says Ms Martin.</p>
