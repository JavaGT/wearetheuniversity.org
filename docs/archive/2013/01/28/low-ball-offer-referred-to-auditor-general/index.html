<p>Lianne<br>DALZIEL<br>Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson</p>
<p><strong>28 January 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Low-Ball Offer Referred To Auditor-General</strong></p>
<p>News that the <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/8230093/Brownlee-cut-payout-for-owners">Government has ignored official advice</a> and slashed pay-outs for the remaining properties in Christchurch’s residential red-zone by half, will form part of a complaint to the Auditor-General, Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Lianne Dalziel said.</p>
<p>“The original advice from the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority’s was to offer affected property owners – those with commercial land and bare sections in the residential red zone - 100 per cent of the most recent rating valuation.</p>
<p>“The Government has ignored that completely and slashed its ‘offer’ to half the rateable value. Talk about rubbing salt in the wound. It’s a low-ball by anyone’s definition.”</p>
<p>“National has been deluded by its own rhetoric that the original red zone offer was a ‘voluntary’ offer.</p>
<p>“When the Government says it will compulsorily acquire your property in the future - once its value has been reduced - then that is not voluntary. Applying duress fails every standard of informed consent.</p>
<p>“The original residential red zone offer produced winners and losers. This just produces losers.”</p>
<p>Lianne Dalziel said that she is preparing a formal complaint to the Auditor-General about the Government’s handling of the residential red zone offer, which will be lodged this week.</p>
