<p><strong>More students but less money</strong></p>
<p>26th of May</p>
<p>The overall cut to tertiary education in this year’s budget will cause real harm to students, their families, and communities.</p>
<p>The government has cut the amount of money to tertiary education and yet it predicts student numbers will rise.</p>
<p>The small increases in funding to areas such as apprenticeships and low-level qualifications, do not make up for the harm overall funding cuts are doing to tertiary education.</p>
<p>NZUSA president Linsey Higgins says students are currently living in poverty.</p>
<p>“Students are living in slums or couch surfing from friend to friend. Students can&#39;t afford to live.”</p>
<p>“These cuts will force students to work more hours. It will stretch them at every point and they will continue to flood counselling services because they are exhausted from trying to make it all work.”</p>
<p>&quot;This budget is toxic for students. It will stop current and potential students from accessing education.&quot;</p>
<p>TEU president Sandra Grey says students’ learning suffers when they are struggling to pay day-to-day bills.</p>
<p>“The increase in students and the cut in funding will be borne by staff having to do more with less.”</p>
<p>&quot;Tertiary education staff have been papering over the gaps caused by underfunding since 2009, they can&#39;t keep making up the shortfall in funding.&quot;</p>
