<p>Health Spokesperson</p>
<p>MEDIA STATEMENT  </p>
<p>27 May 2016</p>
<p>The give with one hand – take with the other Budget</p>
<p>The Minister of Health has pumped out media releases to 20 District Health Boards heralding increases in funding for their regions, says Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King.</p>
<p>“But when you add population growth and inflation into the figures you get a very different picture.</p>
<p>“Only three DHBs have had a real increase in funding. They are Tairawhiti, Lakes and Northland.</p>
<p>“Fifteen DHBs will receive millions of dollars less then they need in this budget. The real losers range from Canterbury with $33 million, Waitemata $27 million and Counties Manukau $18 million.</p>
<p>“This Budget goes nowhere near the $1.7 billion cut that the Health system has suffered over the last six years. This figure has been confirmed by Infometrics Research updated on Budget day. (Infometric figures attached)</p>
<p>“Jonathan Coleman has to be very careful of spin that peddles a very different picture from the truth.</p>
<p>“Labour will launch an interactive map today that will allow Kiwis to see how the Budget hurts services in their areas. People will be able to go the Health Map at <a href="http://www.labour.org.nz/healthmap">http://www.labour.org.nz/healthmap</a>,enter their address and see the level of funding cuts at their local DHB,” says Annette King.</p>
