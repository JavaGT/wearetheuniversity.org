<p>Media Release</p>

<p>Lincoln University welcomes 2016 budget news</p>
<p>Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Robin Pollard, says the specialist land-based university welcomes the 2016 budget announcement as “not only an encouraging budget for universities, this is a good budget for the future of New Zealand’s primary sector and the New Zealand economy as a whole.”</p>
<p>Specific tuition subsidy increases in agriculture (by 16%) and science (by 5%) enable Lincoln to continue to produce the right kind of graduate to grow the sectors that are instrumental to New Zealand’s economic growth and environmental wellbeing.</p>
<p>&quot;Lincoln University embarked on a strategy to provide education and research that contributes to people living well, feeding the world, and protecting the future. Agriculture and science are key to New Zealand&#39;s well-being, and the budget decisions will move us in the right direction&quot;, Professor Pollard said.</p>
<p>&quot;The additional funding will help ensure that students who choose Lincoln University will continue to receive an excellent education with ready access to a broad range of jobs in critical areas following their studies.&quot;</p>
<p>Lincoln University is the smallest in New Zealand, with a specialist focus on teaching and research in the land-based sectors. Lincoln is ranked in the top 3% internationally and is highly regarded for its research outputs within these sectors, and as such the increased investment in science and innovation is also particularly welcome.</p>
<p>The overall investment of $761m in areas including science, skills and tertiary education shows the Government’s commitment to the future of the young people of New Zealand and to the economy and environment.</p>
