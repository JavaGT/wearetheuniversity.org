<p><strong>Young gun Kristy targeting Ireland world champs</strong></p>
<p>Shooting star Kristy Havill’s sporting universe began at 10-years-old with a big bang — the sound of a shotgun reducing a flying clay disc to smithereens.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old Lincoln University elite sports scholar is looking down the barrel of a trip to the world champs in Banagher, Ireland, in July with the New Zealand clay target shooting team.</p>
<p>Her family has been involved in the sport for generations. Grandad and her great uncle have both worn the silver fern, and dad is heavily involved in the sport.</p>
<p>Her parents will also be heading the fan club at the champs.</p>
<p>Kristy will be attempting to hit 250 flying clay targets over three days and if she makes the finals another 50.</p>
<p>She will be competing in the ladies team after posting top qualifying scores last year, and at this year’s nationals to cement her black uniform.</p>
<p>The first year Bachelor of Sport and Recreation student has to pay her own way to the event and has started a ‘Give a Little’ page to help defray some of the costs, ammunition and gun permits among them, while the cost of clay birds adds up, even when you are practising.</p>
<p>She is doing a lot of strength and cardio work and shooting once or twice a week, as well as working on her mental skills.</p>
<p>“Shooting is 80 per cent mental,” she says.</p>
<p>Originally from the West Coast she boarded at Rangi Ruru before having a gap year working on the family farm and then coming to Lincoln, and has had success with the shotgun at school level, being 2014 national girl’s champ.</p>
<p>Her home region has helped get her to the event with a grant from Community Trust Development West Coast</p>
<p>She particularly enjoys the sense of community the sport brings.</p>
<p>“We (the competitors) all catch up at the events around the country,” she says.</p>
<p>Kristy is aiming to move into sports management, or be a player agent, when she finishes her degree.</p>
