<p>**Spark Bikes Receive Boost From SIFT<br>**</p>
<p><strong>Friday 27th May 2016:</strong> Christchurch’s inaugural public bike sharing scheme has received key backing for future development from the Sustainable Initiatives Fund (SIFT).</p>
<p>Over 5,000 trips have been made on the Spark Bikes since the scheme started in 2015 but the two year pilot will end in 2017 and community support is needed for it to continue.</p>
<p>SIFT have provided funding for an independent evaluation that will give insight into how a public bike share system could work in Christchurch for the future.</p>
<p>The founder of the Spark Bikes scheme, Robert Henderson, said the results of the research will be essential for developing local government support needed for the scheme to continue.</p>
<p>“With SIFT’S support we are able to dive deeper into that usage and develop a plan for a citywide bike share system that’s integrated with public transport.” Henderson said.</p>
<p>The SIFT funding will support research that analyses who is using the scheme, identifies areas of growth and considers how to integrate the bikes with other forms of public transport.</p>
<p>SIFT general manager Maria Wake, said the research is “a key part of developing a convenient bike sharing scheme that meshes with other forms of transport.”</p>
<p>Wake said bike share schemes can be beneficial for both people and the environment as it reduces traffic congestion and emissions and makes it faster for people to move around the city.</p>
<p>University of Canterbury geography masters student Danielle Robson is using her passion for active and public transportation and reducing car dependency to do the research.</p>

<p>“My research will focus on evaluating the present and future of bike sharing in Christchurch.”</p>
<p>She hopes the results will provide insight into future station locations and how the scheme could be improved.</p>
<p>“The SIFT funding has allowed me to carry out this research for the bike share pilot and to make a small contribution to sustainable transportation research for Christchurch.”</p>
<p>SIFT finances projects that create or inspire long-term environmental benefits. This includes initiatives that minimise waste, maximise resource efficiency and reduce environmental impact. SIFT is an independent trust established in January 2005 through seed funding from local government waste levies.</p>
<p>As workers move back into central Christchurch, Spark Bikes (the current Bike Share pilot) encourage people to change their transport activity and swap their cars for public transport.</p>
<p>There are a total of six Bike Share stations across the city, with the newest station located at the Bus Interchange, which supports the transport shift by providing an easy transition from bus to bike.</p>
