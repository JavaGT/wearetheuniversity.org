<p>Law changes needed to allow access for blind and visually impaired persons</p>
<p>Better laws are needed to ensure the world’s blind and visually impaired people get access to copyright-protected books and digital information, according to PhD research done at Victoria University of Wellington.</p>
<p>28165_CBM7723The World Blind Union estimates that every year, less than five percent of all published material becomes available to the 285 million blind and visually impaired persons worldwide.</p>
<p>Doctoral research undertaken by a Victoria University of Wellington graduand reveals intellectual property law needs to change in order to improve accessibility to digital and printed material for the blind or visually impaired.</p>
<p>Lida Ayoubi, who graduates with a PhD from Victoria’s Faculty of Law, says that changing the law will help increase the availability of these materials.</p>
<p>“Insufficient access to copyright-protected material is discriminatory and negatively affects the human rights of the visually impaired, including the right to education, culture and science.”</p>
<p>Although the degree of availability is much higher in New Zealand, Australia and Europe, the global statistics are disappointing, and it’s a matter of the law keeping up with technology.</p>
<p>“The state of technology is much better than the state of law.”</p>
<p>One aspect of Lida’s research looked at improving access for the visually impaired at a policy level. “How can we design laws that would make access easier for blind or visually impaired, not just in New Zealand but across the world?</p>

<p>“I explored how different countries are addressing the needs of the visually impaired and what more can be done locally and internationally.</p>
<p>“Access to copyright materials and the state of the law in New Zealand is pretty good and a lot can be learnt from the New Zealand experience.”</p>
<p>Lida’s research also explores why the gap in accessibility exists. “Lack of satisfactory access for the visually impaired is a prime example of the interface or clash between intellectual property rights and human rights—it goes beyond copyright.”</p>
<p>Lida initially became interested in her research area when she came across negotiations being undertaken at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) while completing her Master’s degree. WIPO was exploring a potential instrument to improve access to copyright material for blind or visually impaired persons.</p>
<p>When Lida began her PhD five years ago there was little research being undertaken in this area. “I couldn’t believe that such a huge issue had not been addressed before.”</p>
<p>She chose Victoria’s Law school to benefit from the supervision of leading intellectual property scholars, Professors Graeme Austin and Susy Frankel.  </p>
<p>Lida is now teaching intellectual property law at Auckland University of Technology (AUT), where she is continuing her research in this area.</p>
<p>Lida Ayoubi will graduate with a PhD in Law on Wednesday 18 May.</p>
