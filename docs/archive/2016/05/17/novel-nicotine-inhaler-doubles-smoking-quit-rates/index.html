<p>Novel nicotine inhaler doubles smoking quit rates</p>
<p>A study by researchers at the University of Otago, Wellington shows that smokers who used a nicotine inhaler were twice as likely to quit smoking as smokers using a placebo inhaler.</p>
<p>The researchers developed and tested a novel nicotine inhaler to see whether it helps smokers to quit smoking. Participants in the study were randomly assigned to receive either a nicotine inhaler plus a nicotine patch, or a placebo inhaler plus a nicotine patch.</p>
<p>The results of the New Zealand study funded by the Health Research Council have been published today in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research.</p>
<p>Study team leader Professor Julian Crane from the University of Otago, Wellington, says the findings are the first evidence that inhaled nicotine from a simple standard inhaler is highly effective and substantially increases a smoker’s chances of quitting compared to the best current nicotine replacement treatment.</p>
<p>“Currently most smokers use nicotine patches to help them stop smoking. This study shows that if you add a nicotine inhaler to a nicotine patch, it doubles the chances of quitting over a nicotine patch alone,” says Professor Crane.</p>
<p>Although there is considerable interest in the use of e-cigarettes to help smokers give up tobacco, many countries, including New Zealand, are hesitant to introduce these to the market especially as they are largely unregulated and untested.</p>
<p>“There is considerable debate about whether inhaled nicotine is helpful for people who wish to stop smoking,” says Professor Crane.</p>

<p>“This is the first study to show that inhaled nicotine from a metered dose inhaler in the context of a smoker wanting to stop doubles their chances of quitting.”</p>
<p>The nicotine inhaler gives a metered dose of nicotine and offers an alternative therapeutic option for inhaled nicotine using a standard device that has been used for many decades for treatment of asthma.</p>
<p>“But unlike electronic cigarettes, the inhaler has no physical associations to smoking itself,” he says.</p>
<p>“It also has benefits in that it is much less likely to be used inappropriately to administer other drugs given that it is a completely sealed unit,” notes Professor Crane.</p>
<p>“New Zealand has been a world leader in tobacco control public policy and this new home-grown development offers a world-first opportunity to help the 80% or more of smokers who want to quit achieve their aims,” he says.</p>
<p>The researchers are currently looking at how to make the inhaler available to all smokers who would like to use it.</p>
