<p><strong>Students welcome plan to introduce tertiary bus fares</strong></p>
<p>The Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) welcomes today’s announcement by mayoral candidate Justin Lester and Regional Councillor Daran Ponter for a tertiary concession on bus fares. Lester and Ponter today announced that if elected, they will extend the current discount for high school students to tertiary students.</p>
<p>VUWSA President, Jonathan Gee, says this is a positive step, and welcomes all other candidates to commit to tertiary bus fares.</p>
<p>‘VUWSA has campaigned for <em>Fairer Fares</em> for several years now. Greater Wellington Regional Council showed their commitment in 2014, but tertiary fares are still not a reality.’</p>
<p>‘Students spend thousands of dollars each year to get an education, but can barely afford the bus to get to class.’</p>
<p>‘By supporting a tertiary discount, candidates are acknowledging the over $1 billion contribution that students make to the local economy each year.’</p>
<p>VUWSA’s Welfare Vice President, Rory Lenihan-Ikin says, ‘If implemented, this policy will mean a $500 saving each year for a student catching the bus two zones everyday.’</p>
<p>‘Having tertiary bus fares would be a huge win for Wellington in becoming a truly student-friendly city, and would align us with other major cities around the world who have student fares.’</p>
<p>‘Tertiary fares are also great for the efficiency of our public transport system, as many students travel off peak’ says Gee.</p>
<p>‘Research shows that almost all students would increase their public transport use if a half price discount was introduced.’</p>
<p>‘If elected, we look forward to these candidates taking all possible steps to implement the discount within the next term. We also hope that other council candidates will commit to tertiary bus fares.’</p>
