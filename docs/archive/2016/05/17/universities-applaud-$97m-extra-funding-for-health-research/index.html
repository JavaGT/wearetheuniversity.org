<p>Universities New Zealand release</p>
<p>17 May 2016</p>
<p><strong>Universities applaud $97m extra funding for health research</strong></p>
<p>Universities New Zealand has applauded the Government’s decision to increase funding for health research by 56% over four years.</p>
<p>The decision, announced today as part of Budget 2016, will see increased funding of $97million over four years.</p>
<p>Chris Whelan, Executive Director of Universities New Zealand says this is the biggest increase in health research funding in several years (since 2009/2010).</p>
<p>“Around 90% of health research ends up being carried out by universities. This is research that delivers new or better treatments, drugs and technologies that benefit New Zealanders.”</p>
<p>“The problem has been that funding levels were such that only a small proportion of the proposals for funding were ever able to be supported. This new funding will ensure that more good ideas can be supported.”</p>
<p>Universities will also look forward to contributing to the development of a new health research strategy which was announced today.</p>
