<p>Govt Deceiving Public Over Supergold Card</p>
<p>Auckland senior citizens have good reason not to trust the Prime Minister and the National Government who are working to destroy the SuperGold Card, according to New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“On 6 April, Mr Key said ‘the entitlements for the SuperGold Card are not changing’ but on 1 July, 650,000 senior citizens must spend $15 if they want to use public transport in Auckland,” New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters says.</p>
<p>“When questioned in Parliament today the Prime Minister’s lame excuse was that this was the advice he had been given.</p>
<p>“Auckland Transport’s Swap to the Hop card has been an almighty flop wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars as well as confusing and stressing out thousands of senior citizens.</p>
<p>“We’ve been advised 50,000 seniors have already bought a blue Hop card which will have to be changed at great cost.</p>
<p>“We have discovered also that Auckland Transport has deceitfully used the SuperGold Card branding and will print gold Hop cards meaning those 50,000 people have to get new cards.</p>
<p>“This is a complete waste of money and Auckland Transport have been forced by government into being deliberately deceitful about it.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister is trying to make out nothing has changed and that the SuperGold Card and the Hop card are the same. They are NOT,” Mr Peters says.</p>
