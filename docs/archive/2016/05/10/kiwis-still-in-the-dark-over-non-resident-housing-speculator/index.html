<p><strong>Kiwis still in the dark over non-resident housing speculators</strong></p>
<p>Data released today by LINZ gives no real insight into the influence of non-resident foreign speculators on the New Zealand housing market, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>“By LINZ’s own admission, this is nowhere near the full picture on how many non-resident foreign buyers are snapping up properties in New Zealand,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders desperately need the Government to collect definitive information on the number of non-resident foreign housing speculators operating in New Zealand, and the Government has let us down.</p>
<p>“LINZ has admitted that this data is far from perfect. Businesses, trusts, and some student and work visas are exempt – that’s a whole lot of missing data.</p>
<p>“John Key has been denying for years that non-resident foreign speculators are a problem, while house prices have gone up and up.</p>
<p>“This is a critically important issue for young New Zealanders who are being locked out of home ownership.</p>
<p>“This incomplete data seemingly suits the Government, but it’s going to make New Zealanders even more frustrated because it feels like we’re still in the dark over this issue.</p>
<p>“The reality is that any house sold to a non-resident foreign speculator is a house that a New Zealander can’t buy.</p>
<p>“If the Government was on the side of New Zealanders trying to buy their first home, it would ban non-residents from buying here – it’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>“The Government also needs to remove the tax incentives that make New Zealand housing such an appealing prospect for speculators.</p>
<p>“A full capital gains tax, on every property but the family home, and a ban on non-resident foreign buyers (with a sunset clause, if needed) are essential to helping ease the affordable housing crisis,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
