<p><strong>New food entrepreneur in residence at Riddet Innovation</strong></p>
<p>Serial entrepreneur Phil McGrath has just been appointed to a new role of food entrepreneur in residence at Riddet Innovation. The aim is to encourage greater food innovation, entrepreneurial thinking and commercialisation of food science and technology ideas.</p>
<p>Riddet Innovation director Dr Abby Thompson says Mr McGrath’s experience in the food industry will be an invaluable asset.</p>
<p>“We have numerous companies approaching us to work with our Food Innovation Team, and use the FoodPilot to utilise our technical expertise around product development. Being able to discuss new ideas with someone who has global experience in the commercialisation and marketing of food products can be really valuable when considering how to proceed.</p>
<p>“This is also a great opportunity for Mr McGrath to work alongside Massey staff and students and help tweak their entrepreneurial thinking,” she says.</p>
<p>A self-confessed foodie, Mr McGrath has spent many years in food industry positions in New Zealand and overseas. A Massey graduate, he was co-founder of the Rafferty’s Garden baby food brand, and now spends a large part of his year travelling the world with his company Food Locomotive, looking for food market opportunities. His team includes former NASA food scientists, food safety specialists and commercialisation experts.</p>
<p>He has worked on products ranging from high-value vegetable powders to value-added honey products. Mr McGrath says he is always on the lookout for new technology that can provide benefits to consumers.</p>
<p>“My experience is wide-ranging, and more recently I have focused on overseas market trends, particularly in disruptive retail foods. I love generating new ideas, disrupting markets, problem-solving and helping people build new brands. This new role is the ideal opportunity for me to share my passion for commercialising food innovation,” he says.</p>
<p>Although the role is part time, Mr McGrath will be available to provide companies with feedback on their food innovation plans.</p>
<p>Riddet Innovation has some of the best facilities in New Zealand for supporting food product development. It has access to a wealth of industry-experienced expertise within the School of Food and Nutrition, and the Food Innovation Team, as well as the capability of the Food Pilot, which is part of the Food Innovation Network, and the Nutrition Laboratory. It has the ability to take on a range of projects from strategic research to practical processing and technology development.</p>
