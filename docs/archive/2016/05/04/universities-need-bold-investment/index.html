<p><strong>Wednesday, 4 May 2016, 1:52 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Universities_New_Zealand_-_Te_Pokai_Tara">Universities New Zealand - Te Pokai Tara</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Universities need bold investment not tinkering or faddist thinking</strong></p>
<p>New Zealanders are being urged to keep a close watch on the current review of the tertiary education system to ensure it doesn’t reduce the current quality or range of choices available to New Zealanders.</p>
<p>The review is being carried out by the New Zealand Productivity Commission over 2016 at the request of Ministers English and Joyce.</p>
<p>Chris Whelan, the Executive Director of Universities New Zealand, warns the review has the potential to lead to significant changes to universities that may undermine the quality of teaching and range of programme choices available to New Zealanders planning on studying at university.</p>
<p>He is concerned by the inquiry’s heavy emphasis on technology. “The review is currently trying to find ways that tertiary education could do more to lift national productivity. It has started by asserting, incorrectly in the case of universities, that tertiary providers are not adopting technology fast enough. But it hasn’t asked; what are the ways that young people learn best? And how can universities produce the most capable graduates possible?</p>
<p>“Evidence here and overseas clearly shows that technology enriches and supports learning - but it doesn’t replace the current system. Imagine producing engineers or science graduates without hands-on experience in workshops and laboratories.</p>
<p>“We want to send a clear message to Ministers that New Zealand’s university system is one of the best in the world. New Zealand is unique in having all universities ranked in the top 3% in the world. Our graduates also enjoy excellent outcomes with the best completion rates, highest employment rates, and lowest levels of underemployment compared with every other country for which we have data.</p>

<p>“And we do this at 70% of the funding per student compared with countries like Australia.</p>
<p>“What universities really need from government is future thinking and bold investment in infrastructure. What universities don’t need is short-term tinkering and faddist thinking,” says Chris Whelan.</p>
<p>Chris Whelan says New Zealand’s productivity and economy are in fact buoyed up by our graduates.</p>
<p>“Universities make a significant contribution to New Zealand’s productivity by developing nearly 36,000 capable, innovative graduates each year. Not only have they completed curriculum that has typically been developed with input by employers, they have been through programmes that prepare them for life by developing capabilities such as critical thinking, problem solving, working in teams, communicating and organising themselves.”</p>
<p>“The job of a university is to provide an environment and curriculum that will help graduates eventually become our future leaders, thinkers, and innovators as well as becoming good employees, parents and citizens.”</p>
<p>Australian research released this week confirms the “graduate effect”. It found that having more graduates in the economy boosts the wages of workers without a degree through workplace productivity gains that make Australia&#39;s industries more competitive, as well as higher spending that flows into the economy.</p>
<p>Canada has recognised the importance of a strong university sector. In March the government invested NZ$2.3 Billion into university infrastructure including research and innovation facilities to drive prosperity and enhance the quality of life for all Canadians.</p>
<p>Chris Whelan warns that the main challenge to the quality of New Zealand’s high quality university system is the current funding model. “Considerable funding pressures are limiting universities ability to maintain quality and invest in new business models.</p>
<p>“We suggest the government makes bold strategic and financial initiatives to strengthen the high-performing university sector. While our universities are not perfect they are well managed, innovative and adaptive, and deliver excellent outcomes for graduates. The inquiry needs to focus on the parts of the tertiary sector that do not provide world-class education or value for New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“In short, we have a world-class university system. Our message is invest in it. Don’t tinker with it. And don’t break it.”</p>
