<p>Professor calls for inquiry into mental health services  </p>
<p>Professor Max Abbott, Dean of the Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences at Auckland University of Technology, is calling for an independent commission of inquiry into mental health services.</p>
<p>The former president of the World Federation for Mental Health, and founding national director of the Mental Health Foundation, says there are number of reasons why a review is required.</p>
<p>“The Minister of Justice, Amy Adams, yesterday highlighted the large number of people appearing before the courts who have mental health disorders, and called on the health sector to provide more help. Peter Dunn, Associate Minister of Health, has also recently called for a health rather than a criminal justice response to people who misuse illicit drugs.”</p>
<p>Professor Abbott said he strongly supports both ministers. Aside from directly helping people with significant mental health issues, he says this approach could reduce re-offending and enable police, courts and corrections resources to be deployed elsewhere.</p>
<p>He acknowledges that this presents huge challenges however. “As Ministry of Health officials have stated, demand has increased markedly in recent years and services are heavily strained. There is no way that more could be done without significant increases in funding and changes in the way services are delivered. A more systematic, stepped care approach is required, that makes efficient use of new technology,” he says.</p>
<p>In addition, there are ongoing instances in which coroners and the media identity serious short-comings and breakdowns in existing services. There are also disconnects between primary and secondary care, with people with severe mental disorders having serious physical health problems and reduced life expectancy and many people with common anxiety and affective disorders being unable to access appropriate treatment and support.</p>
<p>Professor Abbott emphasises that we have a mental health blueprint to guide service planning and development, which for the most part is great on paper – however he adds that it would be helpful to have a clear picture of where is has got to across the country, what the success stories are, and what gaps and barriers exist.</p>
<p>“It is time to step back and look at the big picture,” says Professor Abbott. “I have little doubt that things are much better than they were when we had thousands of people detained out of sight and out of mind in large Dickensian institutions. However there are many indications that there are gaps, if not chasms, that require attention.”</p>
<p>Professor Abbot also cites lack of information as an issue, asking “Why is it over a decade since we last had a national mental health survey?”</p>
