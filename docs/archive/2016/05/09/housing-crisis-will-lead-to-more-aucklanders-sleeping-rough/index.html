<p>Affordable-housing crisis will lead to more Aucklanders sleeping rough</p>
<p>The Government’s new emergency housing fund money does nothing to address the underlying causes of Auckland’s affordable housing crisis, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>Paula Bennett today announced a $41.1 million-dollar emergency housing fund boost to be spent over the next four years.</p>
<p>“The Government finding some money to help the outstanding organisations who feed, clothe and help house our homeless is a good step, but it doesn’t address the underlying causes of the Auckland affordable housing crisis or prevent more people becoming homeless,” said Green Party social housing spokesperson Marama Davidson.</p>
<p>“There’s a housing crisis in Auckland, and it’s the people who have the least that are affected by it the most.</p>
<p>“What that looks like is more people sleeping rough in downtown Auckland, more people begging for money on Queen Street and more people sleeping in cars and garages.</p>
<p>“If National really cared about affordable housing solutions, it would remove the tax incentives for investors to buy up properties, including in so-called ‘cheap’ areas, and it would use its purse to build more state and affordable housing.</p>
<p>“Instead of doing something meaningful to address the affordable housing crisis in Auckland, the Government keeps offering up piecemeal ‘solutions’ – today’s announcement from Paula Bennett is another example of that.</p>
<p>“For many, many Aucklanders, the possibility of ever being able to buying their own house is a complete pipe dream.</p>
<p>“They’re worried about being able to pay their rent and feed their kids, and they live with the constant fear of getting kicked out onto the streets.</p>
<p>“Becoming homeless is a very real threat for many thousands of Aucklanders, and the Government’s housing policies do very little to address that threat,” said Ms Davidson.</p>
