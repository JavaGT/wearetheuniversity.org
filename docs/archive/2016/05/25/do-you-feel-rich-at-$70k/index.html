<p>Do you feel rich at $70K?</p>
<p>Press release: ACT New Zealand<br>May 25, 2016. 9:00am</p>
<p>People earning $70,000 aren’t rich, and shouldn’t be taxed as though they are, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“No-one on a five-figure salary should have to pay a 33% tax rate. Seventy thousand was once big money, but inflation and rising wages have pushed more and more workers into this top tax bracket.</p>
<p>“These aren’t rich pricks. These are hard-working Kiwis paying off mortgages and raising families. Yet National taxes them at 33%. The top tax bracket shouldn’t cut in until someone earns at least $100,000.</p>
<p>“Bill English claims taxpayers must keep waiting for tax cuts, but it’s actually just a matter of priorities. We could fund a sensible tax cut this year by eliminating corporate welfare and using a small portion of Budget 2016’s new spending.</p>
<p>“Households deserve greater control over their own incomes. They’ll do a better job of choosing how to spend their money than Steven Joyce will.”</p>
<p>Under ACT’s proposal, the top tax bracket wouldn’t take effect until workers reach an income of $100,000. ACT would then cut taxes for everyone earning between $48k and $100k down to 25%.</p>
<p>ACT’s proposal for Budget 2016:</p>
<p>Income Bracket</p>
<p>Current</p>
<p>Proposed</p>
<p>$0 to $14,000</p>
<p>10.5%</p>
<p>10.5%</p>
<p>$14,001 to $48,000</p>
<p>17.5%</p>
<p>17.5%</p>
<p>$48,001 to $70,000</p>
<p>30%</p>
<p>25%</p>
<p>$70,001 to $100,000</p>
<p>33%</p>
<p>25%</p>
<p>Over $100,000</p>
<p>33%</p>
<p>33%</p>
<p>These tax cuts would cost around $1.5 billion, and would be funded by eliminating corporate welfare ($1.3 billion), plus just $200 million in new spending. Core services like health and education would not be affected.</p>
<p>“Tax brackets would also be indexed to inflation, stopping workers from unwittingly being pushed into higher tax brackets,” said Mr Seymour.</p>
<p>“This is a modest proposal. ACT would make provision for further tax cuts in Budget 2017.”</p>
