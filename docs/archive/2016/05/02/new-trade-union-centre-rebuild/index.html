<p><strong>Monday, 2 May 2016, 10:25 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Council_of_Trade_Unions">Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>New Trade Union Centre Rebuild</strong></p>
<p>A new Trade Union Centre (TUC) returns to Christchurch five years after the devastating 2011 Feburary 22, earthquake.</p>
<p>The new centre will open on May Day - International Workers Day - at it new north Christchurch location.</p>
<p>The new centre replaces the former TUC built in 1977 in Christchurch’s CBD. That building with many others was cordoned off by the Crown and eventually demolished forcing tenant Unions, lawyers and community based organisations to find office accommodation outside a crippled city.</p>
<p>Trade Union Centre Board chair Paul Watson said &quot;It’s great to have a Union Centre back up and past tenants coming home. The new building is a symbol of the determination of shareholding Unions to re-establish a place where workers organisations, community groups and kindred spirits can meet to advance their collective interests,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With around 50,000 union members in Canterbury there is much to be done to protect and advance the interests of working people in this current political environment. This building will not only offer an excellent working space for its occupants but it will also serve as a welcoming and supportive place where people can exchange ideas and work together to build collective strength for a better future.&quot;</p>
<p>The new site was developed by Luneys Development Limited and built by Hanham and Philp Construction and is an anchor building in the new Northfield Business Park development in Langdons Road, Papanui.</p>
