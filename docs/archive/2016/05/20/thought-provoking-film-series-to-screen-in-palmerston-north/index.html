<p><strong>Thought-provoking film series to screen in Palmerston North</strong></p>
<p>The stories of nine women on the front lines of change in the Middle East are the focus of the 2016 film series, which will screen at the Palmerston North City Library on May 21 and 24.</p>
<p>Hosted by Massey University, Graduate Women Manawatu and Palmerston North City Library, the series kicks off with six short films on Saturday and will be followed by the renowned documentary <em>The Trials of Spring</em> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The films will screen at Events Central on the ground floor of the City library.</p>
<p>Senior lecturer in the School of People, Environment and Planning Dr Sita Venkateswar says it’s a privilege to be able to bring these films to the region.</p>
<p>“We have been screening films annually since 2013, and they offer an opportunity to engage in dialogue with the wider Palmerston North community that often includes people from the countries of focus in the films, residing in our midst. They are countries that New Zealanders know little about – apart from the scenes of violence in the media from these regions at the moment. This is an excellent opportunity to connect with these parts of the world through the lives of the women profiled in the films.”</p>
<p>Launched at the 2015 Human Rights Watch Film Festival, <em>The Trials of Spring</em> was created by award-winning documentary makers Abigail Disney and Gini Reticker. The six short films cover the lives of women in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Syria, Bahrain and Yemen on the front lines of change after the Arab Spring uprising. The longer documentary film follows the lives of three Egyptian women, their challenges and the role women play in shaping the future of the region.</p>

<p>Dr Venkateswar says the film series provides a great opportunity to bring people together and then discuss the films after the screening.</p>
<p>“We host a social gathering before the films, with discussion following the screening, to which we invite Massey experts on the region, or we connect with international experts/spokespersons via Skype so they can enhance our understanding of the contexts highlighted in the films. These forums generate a dialogically rich environment that brings lots of people together from Palmerston North’s diverse community.”</p>
<p>This year the film series is also a fundraiser, with the entry charge a gold coin donation. Dr Venkateswar says all money raised will go to the Hegg Hoffett Fund for Displaced Women Graduates, a fund administered by Graduate Women International – the global organisation which Graduate Women Manawatu is affiliated to.</p>
<p>The Hegg Hoffett Fund was initially established in 1936 and assists graduate women who have been displaced as the result of war, political upheval or serious emergencies. It provides short-term grants for refresher courses for re-entry into the woman’s professional field, or training courses leading to other employment if that is not possible. In addition to financial support, the organisation also provides women with moral support to help them adjust to life in a new country.</p>
<p>“As an anthropologist, I find this a fantastic opportunity to bring the community together to discuss what is happening in the world,” says Dr Venkateswar.</p>
