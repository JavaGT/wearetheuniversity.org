<p><strong>Māori Party congratulates Dr Kim Workman</strong></p>
<p>The Māori Party joins with Ngāti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa and Rangitāne to honour Dr Kim Workman who was conferred with an honorary doctorate from Victoria University today.</p>
<p>Co-leader of the Māori Party Marama Fox says: “Kim has been a relentless advocate for a fairer, more just criminal justice system over the past six decades and his efforts have shone a much needed spotlight on issues that plague our justice sector.”</p>
<p>“While the kumara does not speak of its own sweetness, I couldn’t let this opportunity go by without acknowledging how proud I am of my fellow kinsman Kim, who has led the national debate on ways in which the state and communities, including iwi, can provide for a more effective criminal justice system,” she says.</p>
<p>“I congratulate Victoria University for bestowing the honorary doctorate on Kim and I agree with the university that it is a much deserved honour indeed,” she says.</p>
<p>Māori Party Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell says: “Whether he is debating how to reduce crime or rehabilitate offenders, pointing out human rights issues or forcing debates on policy related to social justice issues, he stands as a sentinel for what is just. For that, I have always admired his integrity and kaupapa.”</p>
<p>“As a people we have constantly grappled with the persistent and pervasive unconscious bias of the justice system, and Kim has acted as the consummate spokesperson on issues related to Māori in this area.”</p>
<p>“He is a leading authority in his own right and we look forward to capturing the lessons he will offer in his book <em>The Criminal Justice System, the State and Māori – from 1985 to the Present</em> due to be published next year,” he says.</p>
