<p><strong>Greens call on Bill English to stop ‘disciplining’ Housing New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party is calling for the Government to stop extracting a multimillion-dollar dividend from Housing New Zealand in the name of “discipline”, while the country is in the grips of a housing emergency.</p>
<p>In response to the launch of the Green Party’s <a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/policy/fairer-society/homes-not-cars">Homes Not Cars</a> housing plan yesterday, Finance Minister Bill English said the dividend could not be used by Housing New Zealand to build more state houses because it is instead “used to place a discipline” on the Crown entity.</p>
<p>“We have people sleeping in cars, in garages and on the streets, and all Bill English cares about is teaching Housing New Zealand a lesson or two,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>“Making Housing New Zealand hand over its dividend while thousands of people don’t have a roof over their heads isn’t discipline – it’s cruel and unusual punishment.</p>
<p>“Homeless New Zealanders are suffering because of this Government’s ludicrous attachment to ‘disciplining’ Housing New Zealand, rather than just letting it build more houses with the money it’s already made.</p>
<p>“Housing New Zealand is forecast to make a dividend of $118 million and pay $89 million in taxes in 2015/2016. All of that money is disappearing into the Government’s accounts, and potentially none of it is being spent on building new houses.</p>
<p>“The Government’s compassion and common sense has gone right out the door when it comes to dealing with the housing crisis.</p>

<p>“Housing New Zealand has the money to build more houses for our most vulnerable people, the Government just needs to empower it to do so.</p>
<p>“The Green Party’s Homes Not Cars policy would see Housing New Zealand retain its dividend this financial year, as well as receive a tax return, with all $207 million of that money going towards building around 450 new state houses.</p>
<p>“The Government can ensure all New Zealanders live in a warm, safe, dry home – it just needs to decide to make that happen,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
