<p><strong>Hutt Valley schools working together for local kids</strong></p>
<p>Eight schools in the Hutt Valley are a part of two new groups of schools forming Communities of Learning for over 3,000 students. Raphael House Rudolph Steiner School will join four other schools across the country to form the Steiner Waldorf Community of Learning, while seven other Hutt Valley schools will collaborate to form a second Community of Learning.</p>
<p>1,400 students across Pomare School, Tui Glen School, St Michael’s School (Taita), Taita Central School, Avalon Intermediate School, Koraunui School and Taita College will also come together to share teaching practices and expertise as the Taita/Stokes Valley Community of Learning.</p>
<p>“I’m very proud that the Hutt Valley will play a leading role in the Government’s $359m investment in education promised before the last election,” says Chris Bishop, the National List MP based in the Hutt Valley.</p>
<p>The two groups will join the Wainuiomata Community of Learning established in December 2015 which includes nearly 2,500 students from Akarua School, Fernlea School, Konini Primary School (Wainuiomata), Pukeatua Primary School (Wainuiomata), St Claudine Thevenet School, Wainuiomata High School, Wainuiomata Intermediate and Wainuiomata Primary School.</p>
<p>“Hutt Valley students will benefit from teachers working alongside each other on goals to help improve educational outcomes in the classroom. Together they can achieve even more for our children,” says Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>“Evidence shows quality of teaching and school leadership are the two most important factors in a child’s education, so the Government is supporting those areas.</p>
<p>“The eight new Hutt Valley schools join more than 1,000 schools working together in 117 Communities of Learning across the country. This investment supports more than 320,000 Kiwi kids to raise student achievement, covering 40 per cent of all New Zealand schools.</p>
<p>“Our local communities will be encouraged to work together on challenges they identify for their students. Students benefit from schools sharing expertise and resources, which has a flow on effect to other schools in the Hutt Valley.</p>
<p>“We are continuing to focus on what really matters to families in the Hutt, improving performance in our education system to ensure every Hutt Valley child has the opportunity to succeed.”</p>
