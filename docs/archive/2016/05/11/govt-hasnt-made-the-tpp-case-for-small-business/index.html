<p><strong>Wednesday, 11 May 2016, 1:31 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>David Clark<br>MP for Dunedin North<br>Trade and Export Growth Spokesperson</p>
<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>11 May 2016</p>
<p>Govt hasn’t made the TPP case for small business</p>
<p>Almost two-thirds of small businesses do not fully support staying in the TPP – showing the Government has struggled to sell New Zealand businesses on the deal, says Labour’s Trade and Export Growth spokesperson David Clark.</p>
<p>“Todd McClay has desperately spun the latest MYOB figures to try to sell a good news story for the Government. The figures are clear though. The MYOB press release says, ‘36 per cent said they favoured staying in the TPP’. That means two-thirds are either against the deal or haven’t yet formed a strong enough view to affect their vote.</p>
<p>“Just 39 per cent of exporting small businesses support the TPP. This shows there are growing concerns that the TPP is more than just a trade deal.</p>
<p>“By refusing to engage properly with concerns of the opposition, unions, academics and business as in previous FTAs, National has run roughshod over a traditional bi-partisan convention. Tying the hands of future governments has previously only been done by agreement.</p>
<p>“The process has been rushed and communication botched. Treasury says, ‘the timeframes for decisions have not allowed for a full assessment of the potential impacts or risks of some of the proposals’.</p>
<p>“Businesspeople are right to be concerned about such a situation.</p>
<p>“The TPPA will have ramifications for generations of New Zealanders. For their sake, we should not enter into an agreement which may exacerbate long-term challenges for our economy, workforce, and society so lightly,” says David Clark.</p>
