<p>The mock scanner at CAMRI</p>
<p>The country’s first mock MRI scanner that enables children or adults to experience a test run MRI, opened for bookings at the University of Auckland recently.</p>
<p>The mock MRI is housed in the Centre for Advanced MRI at the University’s Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences.</p>
<p>The full-scale 1.5 Tesla scanner - without a magnetic field - will enable children requiring an MRI scan for clinical or research purposes to become familiar with the noisy and confined environment of the scanner.</p>
<p>“It is hoped that it will reduce the need for general anaesthesia in some young or anxious children requiring a clinical MRI,” says the operations manager at the CAMRI, Shireen Nanayakkara-McDonald.</p>
<p>“Researchers will also benefit as the mock scanner environment provides a realistic way to practise any tasks expected of children or adults undergoing MRI for research purposes.”</p>
<p>Patients are offered an explanation of the procedure and then go through an MRI rehearsal in which they must lie still in the scanner.</p>
<p>A CD of MR sounds is played insider the scanner during the practice session. The entire process usually takes up to 30 minutes and is led by a radiographer, play therapist, or researcher.</p>
<p>If the patient can successfully lie still in the scanner, they are then booked for an MR exam without sedation (adults) or general anaesthesia (children).</p>
<p>The mock scanner was gifted by Siemens and the facility refurbishment funded by Auckland UniServices Ltd, the commercial arm of the University of Auckland.  </p>
