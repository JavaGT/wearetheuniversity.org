<p><strong>Bennett Resettles Homeless In Jobless Towns</strong></p>
<p>The Minister for Social Housing Paula Bennett wants to resettle Auckland’s homeless to jobless towns like Huntly, Ngaruawahia, Lower Hutt and Palmerston North, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“She’s throwing $5000 at them to move – to push them out of sight, out of mind so National won’t be under so much pressure,” says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Social Development Darroch Ball.</p>
<p>“She knows the media and other commentators are now Auckland based, they rarely go to regional towns.</p>
<p>“Her spur of the moment idea won’t work. She’s had eight years to come up with a sound solution, like building houses and cutting immigration to reduce the number of people settling in Auckland.</p>
<p>“All the towns the Minister mentions that have empty state houses also have had an increase in unemployment – the jobless rate is well above the country’s average. That’s only the official rate, there’s thousands of Kiwis on low income, part-time and casual work.</p>
<p>“Minister Bennett is throwing money at a problem to shift it to forgotten and neglected regional towns.</p>
<p>“It’s desperate, ignorant and insulting to struggling Kiwis who are facing homelessness,” says Mr Ball.</p>
<p>“This type of thinking is exactly the type of thinking that has created the homeless problem in the first place.”</p>
<p><strong>Unemployment Rates:</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Huntly 6.6%</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Lower Hutt 6.3%</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Palmerston North 7.7% (second highest rate in the country)</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Ngaruawahia 6.2%</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Hamilton 6.2%</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Gisborne 8.4%</strong></p>
