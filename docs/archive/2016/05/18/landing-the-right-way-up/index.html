<p>Landing the right way up  </p>
<p>An understanding of global issues and the desire to find out exactly how they can contribute to solving these through getting the right tertiary education has landed 14 secondary school students a trip to Lincoln University this July.</p>
<p>‘Land the Trip’ gives Year 11, 12 and 13 students from Australia and Auckland the opportunity to spend five days on campus attending lectures, meeting current students, finding out about study options and taking part in sport and cultural activities. They will also explore the local environs and take a tour of Christchurch.</p>
<p>The successful applicants come from rural and urban environments and have a variety of interests and ambitions, but all showed an understanding and interest in Lincoln’s mission to ‘Feed the world, protect the future and live well’.</p>
<p>Senior Student Liaison Officer Sophie Prangnell says, “This is a wonderful opportunity for potential students to come together with likeminded people and experience all Lincoln University and Christchurch have to offer. We’ve been running the competition for a number of years to great success, with the highest number of applications ever received this year. The applicants this year not only showed a great understanding of our missions but also had a clear idea of what they are hoping to study with us.”</p>
<p>Auckland student Nina Santos says Land the Trip is an invitation to be part of something much bigger than simply visiting a university. “It’s an invitation to go out and seek what and who I really want to be. I’m crazy enough to think I can change the world. Before moving to New Zealand two years ago I lived in the Philippines and witnessed first-hand the catastrophic effects of climate change. Seeing the beauty of New Zealand motivated me to become an advocate for global citizenship and youth involvement in sustainable development. I am looking at studying Environmental Policy and Planning as I believe that it will provide me with the skills and knowledge I need to address pressing issues and make a difference.”</p>
<p>Year 13 student Sarah Knott says, “I have researched the courses on offer at Lincoln and am particularly interested in the Bachelor of Science - Land, Water, and Environment major as it seems to touch on all the fields I am interested in. Science and the environment is already my passion and this trip would help me decide if Lincoln is the place where I want to make it all happen.”</p>
