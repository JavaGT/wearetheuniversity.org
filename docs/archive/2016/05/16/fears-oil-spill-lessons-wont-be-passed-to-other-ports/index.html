<p><strong>Fears Oil Spill Lessons Won’t Be Passed to Other Ports</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is worried valuable lessons from the Mobil oil spill in Tauranga will not lead to improvements around the country.</p>
<p>Mobil was fined $288,000 today for the spill in April 2015 in which thousands of litres of oil leaked into Tauranga Harbour.</p>
<p>“The spill could have been prevented with the right equipment in place which should become mandatory at all ports if we are serious about protecting waterways,” says Spokesperson for Conservation Clayton Mitchell.</p>
<p>“An automatic switch-off valve activated by a drop in pressure would have stopped the leak.</p>
<p>“A lack of appropriate booms meant the clean-up was far too slow.</p>
<p>“Of a 48-point plan following the spill only a few points relate to equipment shortfalls which proved crucial to the outcomes on that day.</p>
<p>“We hope lessons have been learned and will translate to improvements at other ports.</p>
<p>“This government must do away with the endless plans and evaluations and get the right equipment in place throughout the country right now.”</p>
