<p><strong>Under-reporting shows need to review quota system</strong></p>
<p>The Government must launch an independent review into New Zealand’s 30-year-old Quota Management System following a new report suggesting gross under-reporting of catch in the New Zealand fishing industry, Labour’s Environment spokesperson David Parker says.</p>
<p>“The Auckland University report found the total New Zealand fisheries catch from 1950 to 2010 was 38.1 million tonnes - 2.7 times the 14 million tonnes officially reported to the United Nations.<br>“It is sadly unsurprising that there could be fraudulent practises among an industry where some rogue players were found to be subjecting foreign workers to slave-like conditions aboard their vessels. Despite initial denials by the industry, it was proven that some workers were being paid under the minimum wage with intolerable living and work conditions.</p>
<p>“We mustn’t let the bad behaviour of some once again bring the entire industry into disrepute.</p>
<p>“The new fisheries catch data released today should be taken very seriously. It suggests a gross under-reporting of actual catch, which would mean a significant amount of by-catch is being discarded,” David Parker says.</p>
<p>Labour’s Fisheries spokesperson Rino Tirikatene says when the QMS was introduced it was regarded as one of the most effective fisheries management regimes in the world.<br>“The international science now available did not exist 30 years ago. Monitoring is now old fashioned and incomplete.</p>
<p>“The industry has been working to improve commercial catch data through innovative new technologies. Efforts are also being made to gather better information on recreational catch.</p>
<p>“We must ensure the QMS is updated to properly protect our fishery,” Rino Tirikatene says.</p>
