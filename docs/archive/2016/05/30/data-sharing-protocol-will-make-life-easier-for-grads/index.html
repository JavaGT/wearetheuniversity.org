<p><strong>Universities New Zealand - Media release</strong></p>
<p><strong>29 May 2016</strong></p>
<p><strong>Student data sharing protocol will make it easier for grads to work and study overseas</strong></p>
<p>Universities New Zealand is delighted to join a global initiative that will make it easier for international students to transfer to our universities and for New Zealanders to do further study overseas.</p>
<p>Chris Whelan Executive Director of Universities New Zealand says New Zealand has become part of a digital data sharing protocol between education organisations which will enable students to study and work around the world.</p>
<p>He says, “In the past it has been a slow and difficult process for students and graduates to provide proof of university qualifications to both universities and potential employers, here and overseas. Many organisations and immigration officials demand to see their original paper-based credentials, which need to be manually authenticated by universities then couriered to them.”</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, Universities New Zealand has just become a signatory to the Groningen Declaration in Cape Town alongside organisations in the United States, China, the United Kingdom and a number of other European countries. Membership is by invitation only.</p>
<p>“This is a major milestone towards having immediate access to secure and authenticated academic transcripts. It means employers can have full confidence in credentials, and graduates can access advanced study and work opportunities faster and more conveniently”.</p>

<p>Dr Pat Sandbrook, Massey University’s Director of Student Administration and Chair of the UNZ Committee on Student Administration and Academic Services says, “Universities are moving to phase out paper-based documents and paper-based authentications where practicable, as these are time-consuming to handle and open to fraudulent misuse. There will be significant efficiency gains across New Zealand’s university system. “</p>
<p>Representing Universities NZ at the Cape Town, South Africa meeting of the Groningen Declaration Network was Joanna Browne, Director of Academic Services at the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>Joanna says, “Through the network we can share best practices in digital secure systems and co-ordinate our policies and regulatory frameworks. This is a logical next step building on the New Zealand universities’ high reputation for integrity”.</p>
<p>To put the principles of the Groningen Declaration into practice, all eight New Zealand universities and 39 Australian universities are currently working to set up a cloud-based digital student data exchange. When completed this will enable graduates to manage their own authenticated academic transcripts online, and share them with employers and other learning institutions globally.</p>
<p>Chris Whelan says, “This initiative is another great example of how New Zealand’s universities work together to save time and money and provide better services to graduates”.</p>
