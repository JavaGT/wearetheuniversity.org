<p><strong>Monday, 30 May 2016, 1:24 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>30 MAY 2016  </p>
<p><strong>PM Stoops To ‘Bilge Rat’ Politics On Auckland Housing</strong></p>
<p>Auckland Council is a victim of the ‘bilge rat’ politics of Prime Minister John Key, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Mr Key is bullying the council. Fix housing or we put in commissioners. That’s dictatorial. It’s arrogant.</p>
<p>“National has had eight years to address the shortage of housing in Auckland.</p>
<p>“In 2007 John Key was outspoken in condemning the Labour government for its lack of action.</p>
<p>“He has done nothing, and worse has stoked the fire. He never warned the council the government would ramp up immigration to record levels,” says Mr Peters.</p>
<p>“Now in desperation, as garages and cars become Auckland’s new lifestyle, teachers escape the city, and students are forced to couch surf for a bed each night, he blames the Auckland council.</p>
<p>“The very council imposed on the people by the National Party and specifically by ACT Party leader Rodney Hide.</p>
<p>“Solutions to the housing crisis were swirling around, but everyone ignored the elephant in the room – artificial demand from immigration.</p>
<p>“It is an untouchable issue.</p>
<p>“Around 35,000, or nearly 700 people a week, are looking for a home in Auckland. But we must not talk about it, heaven forbid.</p>
<p>“National doesn’t have the guts, nor do others, to address the core issue – immigration. Yet tomorrow, the tap could be turned down. It is controllable.”</p>
