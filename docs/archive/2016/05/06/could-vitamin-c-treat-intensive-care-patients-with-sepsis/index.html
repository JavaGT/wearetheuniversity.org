<p>Could vitamin C treat intensive care patients with sepsis?</p>
<p>Study into vitamin C’s effectiveness in treating intensive care patients.</p>
<p>A Christchurch researcher is doing New Zealand’s first study of vitamin C&#39;s potential as a treatment for intensive care patients with sepsis.</p>
<p>Dr Anitra Carr is doing the clinically-relevant work with support from the Health Research Council (HRC). She was recently awarded a $500,000 Sir Charles Hercus Health Research Fellowship for promising emerging researchers.</p>
<p>Dr Carr works at the University of Otago&#39;s Christchurch health campus with its Centre for Free Radical Research.</p>
<p>She says sepsis is the main cause of death in intensive care patients. Rates are increasing and treatment options for the life-threatening condition are limited. Patients with severe sepsis often develop cardiac dysfunction and dangerously low blood pressure (known as septic shock) and are given drugs to stabilize their cardiovascular function.</p>
<p>Dr Carr’s hypothesis is that cardiac dysfunction, and resulting drug treatments, could be avoided if patients had appropriate vitamin C levels. When sepsis patients experience cardiac problems, they are often given drugs to stimulate the cardiovascular system. Dr Carr says vitamin C is potentially involved in a similar natural process, and if levels were high enough patients might not need as much medication.</p>
<p>Dr Carr will carry out a clinical trial in Christchurch where people with sepsis are given the vitamin to see if this intervention results in a better recovery or survival. She will be trying to find out whether the positive biological effects of vitamin C translate into an improvement in patient outcome, which has been reported in a smaller study overseas. Her study will also involve comparing vitamin C levels with severity of illness and whether this contributes to progression of sepsis.”</p>

<p>HRC Chief Executive Professor Kath McPherson says the Sir Charles Hercus fellowship is a really important opportunity for New Zealand’s up-and-coming scientists to consolidate their research career, and “we’re delighted to be able to support Anitra in this way.”</p>
<p>Dr Carr says she is very grateful to the HRC for the funding that will allow her to carry out clinical research that will have a positive impact on the outcomes of critically ill people and potentially even save lives.</p>
