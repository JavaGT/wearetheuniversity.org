<p><strong>Wimpy Response by Minister Over Velvetleaf</strong></p>
<p>The government is waving a white flag over the serious incursion of the invasive weed velvetleaf which has spread from four sites last year to over 219 today, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy lashed out in Parliament today at New Zealand First’s concerns over velvetleaf,” says New Zealand First Biosecurity Spokesperson Richard Prosser.</p>
<p>“This shows a callous disregard for what Kiwi arable farmers, our lucrative seed export industry and much of Federated Farmers Waikato are all going through. The minister needs to show some leadership and call for an independent inquiry.</p>
<p>“In Waikato, if eight farms out of 29 have velvetleaf from fodder beet seeds, how did the other 21 become infested?</p>
<p>“In 2015, you could have counted the total number of infested sites countrywide on the fingers of one hand, but this year it has exploded to over 200.</p>
<p>“Fodder beet seeds are definitely one cause of the outbreak but what about the 176,000 tons of maize imported as stockfeed from countries with velvetleaf; mostly Bulgaria and the USA?</p>
<p>“Answering that with a report written in 2011 is not relevant to 2016. Not even close.</p>
<p>“The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) is falling short of its responsibilities and as a result farms will continue to lose multimillion dollar exports.</p>
<p>“These incursions need to be stopped at the border by proper quarantine and 100 per cent inspection,” Mr Prosser says.</p>
