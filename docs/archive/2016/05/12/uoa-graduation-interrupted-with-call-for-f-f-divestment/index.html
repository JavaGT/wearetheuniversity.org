<p>A University of Auckland graduate has called out his alma mater for not divesting from fossil fuels while crossing the stage to receive his degree yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Blaze Forbes, who was receiving a degree in Health Sciences, held up a banner saying &#39;Alumni for Divestment&#39; in front of the audience and the University Chancellor while he crossed the stage at the graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>The protest was part of an ongoing student campaign calling on the University of Auckland to dis-invest its $80 million endowment fund from fossil fuel companies that are the main contributors to climate change.</p>
<p>Mr Forbes said that &quot;I&#39;m ashamed that the University of Auckland, my alma mater, is funding climate change and wrecking the future that its graduates have to live with.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If it claims to be a world-class University, it should follow the lead of Universities like Yale, Stanford, and Glasgow University by divesting from fossil fuels now.&quot;</p>
<p>Last year, University of Auckland students delivered a petition signed by 2800 staff, students and alumni to the University Council asking for them to support a divestment decision, but this was rejected.</p>
<p>Around the world, more than fifty Universities have joined hundreds of other institutions with assets worth $3.4 trillion and divested from oil, gas and coal companies because of moral concerns about contributing to climate change and for financial prudence.</p>
<p>Said Forbes: &quot;if the University of Auckland takes the science of climate change seriously, and honours its role as a critic and conscience of society, then it should put its money where its mouth is and divest.&quot;</p>
<p>The student group Fossil Free UoA said it will continue to escalate its actions over the next few months to make to make the University Council consider its requests seriously.</p>
