<p>At 84, Nancy Keat is the oldest of the University of Auckland’s May graduates.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to spend my time going on senior citizen bus trips,” says 84-year-old Nancy Keat, this year’s oldest University of Auckland graduate.</p>
<p>A Freeman’s Bay resident, Nancy is graduating with a postgraduate Diploma in Art History, having completed a Bachelor of Arts in the subject, with a minor in European studies. And she hasn’t finished yet.</p>
<p>She has enrolled for a one-year Masters degree focusing on public art in Auckland, a groundbreaking area where very little research has been done.</p>
<p>No longer driving, she’s been travelling all over Auckland by bus and train looking at examples of public art and says she could “do a masters on public transport and good cafes”.</p>
<p>“It’s great. I’ve been able to go on the train to places like South Auckland which I really like and not only has fantastic public art – especially murals - but good coffee as well.”</p>
<p>Originally trained as a primary teacher, Nancy went into teaching to avoid a job her parents had lined up for her at what was then the Papakura Borough Council.</p>
<p>“I was expected to fill in time before finding a nice man and getting married.”</p>
<p>After her three children grew up, she started taking courses in art history at the University’s Centre for Continuing Education.</p>
<p>In 2003 when she was 71, a tutor suggested she enrol in a degree and she still remembers her first exam “with huge satisfaction”.</p>
<p>“It felt like a marathon but I was hooked. I discovered I liked doing the research, it was like a treasure hunt.”</p>
<p>Her first degree took eight years to complete, doing one course per semester and attending summer school, while the diploma has taken four.</p>
<p>“My son says he doesn’t know anyone who’s taken as long to get a degree as me, but I haven’t got the pressure of time,” she laughs.</p>
<p> “I feel sorry for those young students who have to get it all done so quickly.”</p>
<p>She says at first the essay format and some of the new technology was a challenge but she was never made to feel out of place by her younger classmates.</p>
<p>“In my undergraduate course especially, there were quite a few of us mature students. I do remember one trip to the art gallery when a student thought I was the lecturer and kept asking me questions.”</p>
<p>However she is one of the few older students to continue to masters level, which she thinks is a shame.</p>
<p>“By this stage, you’ve got used it and I don’t think I’ve found it harder because of my age. I’m fortunate to be in good health.”</p>
<p>She says keeping intellectually active has been very important for her mental health and the process has been as important as the end goal.</p>
<p>“I’m scared of stopping, I’m enjoying the journey too much.”</p>
<p>Nancy’s thesis will focus on the role of public art in Auckland and its relationship to the city’s ethnic diversity.</p>
<p>She expects to complete her degree in July 2017, graduating with a Master of Arts in September.</p>
