<p>The road to academic success has been a long and tough one for 47-year-old Aucklander Tahua O’Leary.</p>
<p>Of Irish and Māori descent, he is graduating from the University of Auckland today with a PhD in philosophy, completing a 27-year journey that has been fraught with debilitating setbacks.</p>
<p>A high school drop out and estranged from his family at 16, he was living rough on the streets and facing a bleak future until a social worker acquaintance saw his potential, offered him a place to live and encouraged him to go back to school.</p>
<p>Leaving without enough qualifications to get into university, he ended up enrolling into the University’s Wellesley programme, a course designed to prepare students for tertiary study.</p>
<p>Completing it allowed him to sign up for a Bachelor of Science in 1990, but major hurdles lay ahead.</p>
<p>A family tragedy sent him spiralling into depression and not long after, he was diagnosed with testicular teratoma which had metastatised into his lymphatic system.</p>
<p>Recovering from surgery and a brutal form of chemotherapy but still determined to continue his study, he enrolled in a chemistry course with a view to becoming a lab technician, but his heart wasn’t in it.</p>
<p>“My partner at the time suggested I quit and do what I cared about,” he says, which turned out be anthropology, “with a side interest in philosophy”.</p>
<p>Deciding to continue on with the history of philosophy, a course that included ethics, metaphysics, logic, and epistemology (theories of knowledge), he discovered his overriding interest, philosophy of mind; a branch within the wider subject that deliberates on whether ‘minds’ are material or not.</p>
<p>Battling all the while with ill health, which at this stage also included a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and possible seasonal affective disorder (SAD), he graduated with a Masters in philosophy, with first class honours.</p>
<p>Turning down opportunities to further his academic career overseas in favour of staying in Auckland to be with his former partner and her child, he embarked on a PhD in philosophy at the University of Auckland that was to consume the next 16 years of his life.</p>
<p>“I did have to take a lot of breaks and time out to deal with my health issues and I also suffered heart failure (idiopathic cardiomyopathy) in 2011,” he says.</p>
<p>What kept him going through it all?</p>
<p>&quot;Stubborn determination and the support of family and friends, especially my partner Megan.&quot;</p>
<p>Today he will be proudly graduating with his partner Megan Hall and four-year-old daughter Aine by his side.</p>
<p>His hopes for the future lie in teaching others what he’s learned.</p>
<p>“Often human values are assumed and unexamined. I would like to use the knowledge I have gained to teach critical thinking skills, especially in the area of values.&quot;</p>
<p>Now all he needs is a job.  </p>
