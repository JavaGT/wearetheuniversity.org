<p>If you’re wondering where leading mayoral candidates stand on vital housing and infrastructure issues, an upcoming debate at the University of Auckland should clarify things.  </p>
<p>Next month mayoral hopefuls will take to the stage at the Auckland Business School to answer questions concerning their visions for the Supercity.  </p>
<p>The Mayoral Debate, hosted by the School of Architecture and Planning at the University of Auckland and supported by GIB and the University of Auckland Society, is an opportunity for voters to measure up these mayoral candidates and hear where they stand on issues vital to Auckland’s future.  </p>
<p>Just over a million people are eligible to vote in Auckland’s Local Body Elections, and recent surveys suggest a significant percent of voters are still undecided.  </p>
<p>With less than a month remaining until polls open, Aucklanders must decide on a replacement for current Mayor Len Brown, who is standing down after two terms.</p>
<p>Chaired by well-known journalist and political commentator Rod Oram, questions on topics such as housing affordability, transport options, funding infrastructure, and Auckland’s Unitary Plan will be put to each of the mayoral candidates.  </p>
<p>Part of the Fast Forward lecture series at the Faculty of Creative Arts and Industries at the University, the Mayoral Debate will include questions from Transparency International New Zealand, the local chapter of the world leading anti-corruption agency.</p>
<p><strong>The Mayoral Debate</strong><br>6.30pm, Wednesday 7 September 2016<br>Fisher &amp; Paykel Appliances Auditorium<br>Owen G Glenn Building<br>12 Grafton Road<br>Auckland.</p>
<p>Chaired by Rod Oram and featuring mayoral candidates.  </p>
