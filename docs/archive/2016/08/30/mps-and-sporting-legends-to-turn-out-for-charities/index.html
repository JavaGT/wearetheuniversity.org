<p><strong>MPs and sporting legends to turn out for Christchurch charities</strong></p>
<p>This Saturday the New Zealand Parliamentary rugby and netball teams will take on Canterbury sporting legends to raise money for Christchurch charities 0800 Hungry and Hohepa Canterbury.</p>

<p>“0800 Hungry and Hohepa Canterbury both contribute significantly to the wellbeing of our Christchurch communities. It is great to have MPs from across the political spectrum supporting their work, and I encourage locals to do the same by coming along to the games and our after-match function,” says Mr Korako.</p>
<p>“We have an impressive line-up of Ministers and MPs taking part in this event, including Speaker of the House Rt Hon David Carter. Hon Gerry Brownlee, who is one of the original Parliamentary rugby teamplayers, will also be making a cameo appearance on the field.”</p>
<p>The Parliamentary rugby side includes Hon Te Ururoa Flavell, Hon Damien O’Connor, Alfred Ngaro, Mark Mitchell, Peeni Henare, Kris Faafoi and Nuk Korako.</p>
<p>Hon Amy Adams, Maureen Pugh, Poto Williams and Louisa Wall will face a strong Canterbury Legends netball team, which includes Silver Ferns Donna Wilkins and Julie Seymour.</p>
<p>Hon Michael Woodhouse will referee the rugby match and well-known New Zealand netball umpires David Palaamo and Michael Wylie will be officiating.</p>
