<p>Environmental Disaster Looms as Giant Ships Use Unsafe Mooring</p>
<p>The government is ignoring the threat of an environmental disaster off the coast of Kawhia near Waikato despite repeated warnings of an unsafe mooring being used by giant cargo ships, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“In June, eye witnesses reported that the dated Taharoa Buoy, in use since 1972, was sinking. This month there are reports of an aborted berthing due to bad weather,” says Conservation Spokesperson Clayton Mitchell.</p>
<p>“The buoy is unstable and not suitable for such massive vessels in rough weather, but commercial pressures are forcing them to use the mooring anyway.</p>
<p>“The government needs to wake up to the dangers of this situation – these ships are parked just 3 kilometres off our pristine shoreline, carrying enough fuel to do a round trip to China.</p>
<p>“Apart from promising there would be a new buoy in November 2016 the Associate Minister of Transport is sitting on his hands and Maritime New Zealand doesn’t seem to know what is going on either.</p>
<p>“This is a shemozzle,” says Mr Mitchell.</p>
