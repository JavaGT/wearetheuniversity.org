<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters<br>New Zealand First Leader<br>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>15 AUGUST 2016</p>
<p>Letter to the editor, New Zealand Herald, by Rt Hon Winston Peters<br>Monday, August 15, 2016</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Your editorial, 15th August, 2016 (We are not immune from seismic shock, A16), states: “he has been touted as a potential kingmaker before every election most of us can remember, but only one election result, 1996, has put him in that position.”</p>
<p>Putting aside the fact that political parties, not one personality, make decisions of this magnitude, your editorial appears to have a scant memory of history.</p>
<p>New Zealand First had the balance of political responsibility in both the 1996 and 2005 elections and has been only 1 per cent off holding the balance of political responsibility in every election since 1996.</p>
<p>In fact, in the last First Past The Post election in 1993 New Zealand First, along with the Alliance, held the balance of political responsibility until National persuaded a Labour Cabinet minister to become the Speaker (Peter Tapsell).</p>
<p>Devoid of the historic facts your editorial has little academic or political value. It is to be hoped that it is not a pointer of lax commentary yet to come.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters<br>New Zealand First Leader<br>Member of Parliament of Parliament for Northland</p>
<p>ENDS  </p>
