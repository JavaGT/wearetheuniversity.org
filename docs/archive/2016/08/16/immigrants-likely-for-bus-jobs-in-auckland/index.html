<p>Immigrants Likely for Bus Jobs in Auckland</p>
<p>Minister of Immigration Michael Woodhouse needs to reassure the 220,000 Kiwis (Woodhouse, Morning Report, Radio NZ, 16th August) wanting a job that visas will not be issued for bus drivers to work in Auckland, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First understands that an Auckland bus company is considering employing 200 drivers from the Pacific.</p>
<p>“Their job vacancy states holding Class 2 and Class 4 licences would be preferable but training to obtain them can be given.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is already taking tens of thousands of low-skilled workers, when immigration settings should only be for skilled workers in areas of shortages and workers who benefit this country.</p>
<p>“The government has a responsibility to ensure Kiwis are looked after but Immigration NZ offers migrants ‘a one-to-one mentoring service’ for migrants to ‘gain and retain’ jobs. Where is the one-to-one service for jobless Kiwis?</p>
<p>“It seems New Zealand has become too politically correct and is catering for the needs of people from other countries at the expense of our own people,” Mr Peters says.</p>
