<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>12 August 2016</p>
<p>National must listen to local government sector</p>
<p>Labour is calling on the Government to heed the chorus of opposition to provisions in its Local Government Act reform bill which could threaten local democracy, and reduce community input into important local decisions, Labour’s Local Government spokesperson Meka Whaitiri says.</p>
<p>“At yesterday’s Select Committee hearing we heard from Grey Power, the Society of Local Government Managers (SOLGM) and the PSA among others, and frankly, the only positive thing said about the reforms was the stated intent of creating greater collaboration and tailored solutions for councils.</p>
<p>“Local Government New Zealand, as well as Mayors and councilors from Stratford, Waikato, Hastings, Central Hawke’s Bay, Tararua, Wairoa, Wellington, Tasman, Central Otago, all South Canterbury councils, and Invercargill have already gone on record in the media with serious concerns about this Bill.</p>
<p>“As the Select Committee process continues it will only become clearer to Local Government Minister Sam Lotu-Iiga just how broad the opposition is to the risky provisions in his Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Bill (No 2).</p>
<p>“Labour supported this to Select Committee as it makes some improvements on National’s shocking 2012 reforms, and we wanted to give the sector its chance to submit on the reforms.</p>
<p>“But the overwhelming concern has been impossible to overlook.</p>

<p>“National are rushing this Bill through, with no consultation with the sector prior to its introduction and allowing only seven weeks from its introduction to the cut-off for submissions.</p>
<p>“Labour supports a partnership approach with local government. We see the value in central government and local Councils being partners, empowering local communities while sharing the responsibility of looking after our people,” says Meka Whaitiri.  </p>
