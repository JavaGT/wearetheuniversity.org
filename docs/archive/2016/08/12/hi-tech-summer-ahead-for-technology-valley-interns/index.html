<p>Media statement</p>
<p>11 August 2016</p>
<p><strong>Hi-tech summer ahead for Technology Valley interns</strong></p>
<p>Chris Bishop, National List MP based in the Hutt Valley, has congratulated four Hutt Valley companies who received R&amp;D Experience Grants announced today by Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce.</p>
<p>“Technology Valley has done very well out of this latest round of Government grant funding,” Mr Bishop said.</p>
<p>“Not only will the overall scheme be administered by Callaghan Innovation located in Gracefield, but four individual Hutt companies will be funded to employ high-tech summer interns at the end of this year. These students will develop their technical skills and will gain valuable work experience.”</p>
<p>Tekron International, CRL Energy and DuluxGroup will each be provided with two $7,200 grants to employ students in their final year studying science, technology, business, engineering or design. A fourth company, Aviat Networks (NZ) has been provided five grants worth $36,000.</p>
<p>“The Hutt continues to develop a reputation for excellence in the hi-tech industry. Research shows that new talent being injected into these Hutt Valley businesses is likely to lead to long-term employment in the Hutt, with 36 percent of 2015-16 summer interns going on to be employed longer by their sponsoring company,” Mr Bishop said.</p>
<p>“This is a great way to attract young people and families into the Hutt Valley and bring with them a significant economic, scientific and social contribution to our community.</p>

<p>“It builds on recent Technology Valley success like the Tech Talks 2016 event organised by Chilton St James student Lucy Chen and held by STEMM Talks Lower Hutt.”</p>
<p>The R&amp;D Experience grant provides funding of $18 an hour for up to 400 hours of work upon proof of the company’s payment to the student (to a maximum of $7,200 excl. GST).</p>
<p>More information for students or businesses interested in the student grants scheme is available <a href="https://www.callaghaninnovation.govt.nz/student-grants/rd-experience-grants">here</a>.</p>
<p>Across New Zealand, 116 businesses have been given 245 grants to employ students over the 2016/17 summer break.</p>
