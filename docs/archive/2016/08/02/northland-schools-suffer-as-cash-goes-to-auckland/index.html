<p><strong>Northland Schools Suffer as Cash Goes to Auckland</strong></p>
<p>Northland schools are being forced to suffer as education funding is sucked up by Auckland, says New Zealand First leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“A newspaper article (<em>Northern Advocate</em>, August 2) has revealed 12 Northland primary schools have more students than teaching space and are having to use kitchens and hallways as classrooms.  </p>
<p>“While some Northland schools have been waiting years for classrooms, two months ago the government announced $153 million would be invested in school property in Greater Auckland which followed a quarter of a billion dollars being spent to upgrade and grow Auckland schools over two years.</p>
<p>“In June the Ministry of Education said a new school would be built and 16 new classrooms developed in Northland.</p>
<p>“It’s time they started delivering on this as well as addressing the chronic lack of teaching space,” Mr Peters says.</p>
