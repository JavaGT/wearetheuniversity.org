<p><strong>Sheep dairying and slam poetry at Massey Open Day</strong></p>
<p>Hundreds of prospective students from throughout New Zealand will be in Palmerston North this week to check out the educational offerings of the city’s two biggest tertiary institutions, Massey University and Universal College of Learning, UCOL.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s Open Day will be the first Massey is holding at its three campuses this month, with Auckland to follow on August 20 and Wellington’s on August 26, which coincides with Victoria University’s Open Day.</p>
<p>Slam poetry, sheep dairying and the spinning wonder of physics phenomenon the Coriolis force are among highlights at this year’s Manawatū campus.Open Day.</p>
<p>Lectures on programmes and degrees from Massey’s five colleges – Business, Creative Arts, Health, Humanities and Social Sciences and Sciences – cover everything from creative writing and film to finance, food technology, marketing, agriculture, accounting, aviation, psychology, nursing, education, engineering, ecology and many more.</p>
<p>Special events this year feature expressive arts and theatre studies students from the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Communication degrees performing slam poetry in the newly refurbished Sir Geoffrey Peren Building auditorium.</p>
<p>The agri-inclined can take the opportunity to test your taste buds on the difference between sheep, goat and buffalo milk, while finding out more about research and development in these emerging dairying sectors. Massey is making a big contribution to the development of sheep dairying in New Zealand, and through this is helping the industry become more diverse, sustainable and consumer-focused.</p>

<p>Tours and interactive workshops are available on a wide variety of topics, from veterinary science to media studies, computer science and languages. A mobile lab will showcase the latest in health and fitness research and technology as part of the Sport and Exercise programme, and staff in the Creative Caravan, from the Wellington-based College of Creative Arts, will be on hand to answer queries on design, art and fashion programmes.</p>
<p>One of the most popular events – already booked out and with additional tours added – is the Equestrian Centre tour, for students who plan to bring their horses to Massey so they can continue competitive riding alongside their studies.</p>
<p>Information sessions and workshops on scholarships, postgraduate study, accommodation, budgeting, student exchanges and study by distance are all part of the Open Day menu. A free sausage sizzle is among activities being organised by the Massey University Students Association (MUSA).</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey will welcome visitors at the Manawatū event. And a special lecture entitled <em>Change the World</em>, by Deputy Pro Vice-Chancellor of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Professor Chris Gallavin, offers a colourful, entertaining insight into the bigger picture benefits, opportunities and value of tertiary education.</p>
