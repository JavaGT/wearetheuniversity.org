<p><strong>Mungo goes to Vietnam</strong></p>
<p>A University of Waikato law student and talented rugby player has just arrived in Hanoi City for a five-day leadership symposium on social change.</p>
<p>Former Tauranga Boys’ College Head Boy Mungo Mason says the trip to Vietnam is part of his leadership development.</p>
<p>The University Scholars’ Leadership Symposium (USLS) by Humanitarian Affairs UK brings together 1000 of the world’s young leaders to discuss and explore social sustainability and service leadership.</p>
<p>Mungo’s one of four University of Waikato students attending the event.</p>
<p>No stranger to leadership, Mungo’s achieved a lot in his four years at university.</p>
<p>The open-side flanker is known for his skills on the field and has a Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship to show for it.</p>
<p>“Right now I’m playing club rugby for Hamilton Old Boys and training hard to make the Waikato Development Squad next season,” says Mungo.</p>
<p>As well as being a student ambassador for the University of Waikato and volunteer sports mentor for the Waikato Academy of Young Achievers, Mungo’s also started a social initiative with two friends that lets university students be charitable in a small way.</p>
<p>“It’s called Flatting for Change and makes donating to social, animal and/or environmental causes more affordable for students,” he says. “It’s all about education, awareness and accessibility.”</p>

<p>Mungo is studying for a Bachelor of Laws with a second major in International Management. He says his qualification paired with experiences such as the USLS are just the things he needs to make positive change happen.</p>
<p>“I’m excited to meet people from all over the world who share my dreams for change but have totally different perspectives on how to make it happen. I think that will be the real eye-opener for me at the symposium and I’m so grateful to the University for supporting me to get there,” says Mungo.</p>
<p>While Mungo’s away, he’ll be logging his experiences through SnapChat, Instagram and Facebook. Follow WaikatoUni on SnapChat to keep up with his adventures.</p>
