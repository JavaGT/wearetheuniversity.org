<p>Indigenous health researcher, Erena Wikaire, receives her Rose Hellaby Maori Education scholarship.</p>
<p>World-leading indigenous health researcher Erena Wikaire (Ngāpuhi and Ngāti Hine) was awarded a prestigious postgraduate scholarship by the Rose Hellaby Māori Education Fund recently.</p>
<p>The fund, managed by Perpetual Guardian, has distributed almost $4 million to support Māori education since 1977.</p>
<p>Erena has worked and studied at Te Kupenga Hauora Māori (TKHM), the University of Auckland’s Department of Māori Health, for more than five years.</p>
<p>She is now studying for a Doctorate in Public Health at the Tāmaki Campus, focusing on how Māori healing traditions can be used to improve health outcomes for Māori.</p>
<p>Erena is researching how to re-normalise the use of rongoā Māori (traditional Māori health practices) in everyday life to empower Māori to regain control over their own wellbeing and thereby improve Māori health outcomes.</p>
<p>Erena took up the cause after her cousin Melissa Wikaire, who had been a tireless supporter of rongoā, passed away from cancer in 2013.  </p>
<p>Her research is based within Ngāti Whātua ō Orākei (central Auckland) and is already attracting international attention in the field of indigenous health.</p>
<p>She says being the recipient of a Rose Hellaby Scholarship is a “huge honour” and she is proud to be using it for research that values traditional Māori knowledge, aligns with the aspirations of Māori and contributes to Māori health and wellbeing.  </p>
<p>“Cost is one of the biggest barriers to postgraduate study for Māori,” says Erena. “The $30,000 Rose Hellaby Scholarship is a major help financially and enables me to concentrate fully on my studies. I am very grateful for the support.”</p>
<p>Her former research supervisor from the Department, senior lecturer, Dr Elana Curtis, says “Erena is an exceptional post-graduate student who has an excellent ability to conduct high quality quantitative and qualitative research from a Kaupapa Māori framework.&quot;  </p>
<p>“We are very proud of Erena&#39;s achievements,” Dr Curtis says. “She first began with TKHM as a research assistant on a project.</p>
<p>&quot;Her research ability was clear and we were able to support Erena to complete her post-graduate diploma papers whilst working with us, and eventually to start her Masters in Public Health.”</p>
<p>“Erena is an asset for TKHM as well as her wider whānau of Ngāti Hine - he mihi maioha!”</p>
