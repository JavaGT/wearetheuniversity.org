<p><strong>Number of homeless working people a national shame</strong></p>
<p>Research released today showing more than half of all homeless New Zealanders are working or studying is a clear sign of just how bad the housing crisis has become, the Green Party said today.<br>Otago University’s ‘Severe housing deprivation in Aotearoa/New Zealand’ <a href="http://www.healthyhousing.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Severe-housing-deprivation-in-Aotearoa-2001-2013-1.pdf">report</a> also finds that new migrants and young people under 25 are at particular risk of being homeless, based on census data from 2013. Today’s report follows information released in June which showed one in every 100 New Zealanders are homeless.</p>
<p>“It’s shameful that in New Zealand even having a job no longer means you can be assured of being able to put a roof over your family’s heads,” said Green Party social housing spokesperson Marama Davidson.<br>“It isn’t right, it isn’t fair, and it’s not the kind of country most New Zealanders recognise or want. The bottom line is that no-one should have to sleep in a car, garage, or on the streets.</p>
<p>“Students also shouldn’t have to choose between working towards qualifications which will improve their lives in the long-term, and having somewhere warm, safe and dry to live – it’s a horrible waste of young people’s potential.</p>
<p>“This data backs up the stories that Aucklanders shared with us during the cross-party homelessness inquiry hearing at Te Puea Marae on Monday, and the <a href="http://www.homelessnessinquiry.co.nz/">submissions we’ve received</a> from around the country.</p>

<p>“Young people and young families with small children are more likely to be denied rental accommodation, and this report shows that they are seriously exposed to the risks of homelessness and poor living conditions.</p>
<p>“The National Government should be taking meaningful action to address the housing crisis, like building more affordable homes, but instead they’ve buried their heads in the sand and have left thousands of Kiwis out in the cold,” said Ms Davidson.</p>
