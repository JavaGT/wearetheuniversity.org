<p><strong>Tracey Martin MP</strong><br>Spokesperson for Education<br>24 AUGUST 2016</p>
<p><strong>Parents Lose Their Voice at Schools as Minister Adopts Dictatorial Approach</strong></p>
<p>The voice of parents, students and the community is being legislated out of education, says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“The Education Minister is removing the charter from Tomorrow’s Schools and will be able to behave like a dictator under the New Education (Update) Amendment Bill which the government introduced yesterday.</p>
<p>“At present, state schools’ Board of Trustees are required to consult their community and develop a charter that reflects the goals and aspirations of the parents and students of their school community over a three-to-five year period.</p>
<p>“The Bill puts in new reporting requirements and provisions for school boards to comply with national performance measures.</p>
<p>“The Minister will also have the power to appoint the board chair under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>“This new iron-fisted approach appears to be in response to schools that refused to do as they were told by the Minister.</p>
<p>“One of the burning questions New Zealand First has is where is the voice of the School Trustees Association in all this? After gaining a large training contract from this Minister they are remarkably silent.”</p>
