<p>Andrew Little<br><strong>Leader of the Opposition</strong><br>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>9 August 2016</p>
<p><strong>Time for John Key to sack his Housing Minister</strong></p>
<p>It is time for the Prime Minister to take serious and meaningful steps to address the housing crisis – and start by sacking Nick Smith as Housing Minister, Leader of the Opposition Andrew Little says.</p>
<p>“Clearly whatever it is National is doing is not working. Skyrocketing house prices continue to lock a generation out of the dream of homeownership and soaring rents are forcing families out of their homes and into cars and garages.</p>
<p>“Since taking on the housing portfolio in 2013, Nick Smith has presided over a series of fiascos including proposals to build houses on cemeteries and power stations, attempts to sell-off state houses that no one wants and moves to make building materials cheaper which actually made them more expensive.</p>
<p>“Then there’s the Minister’s first home buyer subsidises which most Aucklanders can’t access and Special Housing Areas which have become a speculator’s paradise. And just last week, it was revealed that the Government’s $1 billion flagship infrastructure fund was cobbled together in a matter of weeks after the Budget, and councils weren’t even consulted.</p>
<p>“Most New Zealanders believe National is not doing enough to address the housing crisis. They have lost confidence in Nick Smith.</p>
<p>“How can the Prime Minister have confidence in Nick Smith to oversee the building of the tens of thousands of houses New Zealand desperately needs?</p>
<p>“It is time for John Key to sack Nick Smith and replace him with a Housing Minister that can get on and do the job, for the sake of New Zealand,” Andrew Little says.</p>
