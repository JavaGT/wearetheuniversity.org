<p><strong>Govt needs to walk the talk on climate deal</strong></p>
<p>The Government&#39;s announcement that it will ratify the Paris climate agreement this year is a small victory for the tens-of-thousands of people who marched for stronger action on climate change in December, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>“It&#39;s a small step in the right direction from this Government, and is significantly better than its original plan to wait five years before ratifying the Paris agreement,&quot; said Green Party Co-leader James Shaw.</p>
<p>“The climate crisis requires immediate action from all countries and we couldn&#39;t afford for the Government to continue stalling on this global agreement.”</p>
<p>The latest greenhouse gas inventory show New Zealand&#39;s net greenhouse gas emissions grew by 19 percent since National came to power in 2008.</p>
<p>&quot;National now needs to walk the talk and that will require some significant about-turns on intensive dairying, drilling for oil and gas, and building low-value motorways,” said Mr Shaw.</p>
<p>“Pollution has gotten worse under National, but this can change if they actively support growth in sustainable businesses, well-paying jobs, and a cleaner economy.”</p>
