<p>New report shows school funding cut</p>
<p>15 August, 2016</p>
<p>Schools - already struggling to juggle costs - are going to be put under further pressure after a freeze to their operations grant this year, a new report shows.</p>
<p>Research by leading economic consultancy Infometrics shows that this year’s budget freeze actually equates to a 0.5% per-student cut in operational funding for schools next year because of roll growth.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa National Secretary Paul Goulter says it’s an even bigger cut when you take inflation and other costs into account.</p>
<p>“The Government needs to stop the freeze and restore the operations grant to a sustainable level. No Government in recent memory has cut school operational funding up until now, this is an unprecedented move,’’ Mr Goulter says.</p>
<p>“Schools will be forced to make trade-offs between the critically important work support staff do and meeting rising operating costs.”</p>
<p>The operations grant covers costs as wide-ranging as support staff salaries to toilet paper and electricity bills.</p>
<p>The report’s findings shows that:</p>
<p>Even with the targeted funding increase, the total operations grant funding on a per-student basis will be 0.5% lower in the 2016 school year than it was in 2015.</p>
<p>This decline in funding on a per-student basis is even larger in inflation-adjusted terms. It is estimated that the reduction in real per-student funding in 2016 was 0.8% when adjusted by the consumers price index, or 2.3% when adjusted by the education component of the labour cost index.</p>

<p>To return real per-student funding in the 2017 school year to the same level as it was in 2015, an increase of between $40m and $65m in total operations grant funding would be required.</p>
<p>“Schools can’t do more with less. It is inevitable that support staff have to be cut as a result of the freeze.</p>
<p>“We are launching a campaign calling on parents and school communities to send a message to the Minister to stop the funding freeze.”</p>
