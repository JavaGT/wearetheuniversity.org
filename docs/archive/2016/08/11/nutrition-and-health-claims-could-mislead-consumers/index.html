<p>Consumers need to be better protected from misleading nutrition and health claims on food packaging, according to new research.</p>
<p>These claims are displayed to influence consumers’ food choices, but could mislead consumers’ perceptions about what is healthy food, says University of Auckland researcher, Dr Stefanie Vandevijvere.</p>
<p>“It needs to be explored how current regulations on nutrition and health claims in New Zealand could be further strengthened to ensure consumers are protected and not misled,” she says.</p>
<p>Dr Vandevijvere is the lead author on a just published study in the British Journal of Nutrition, that assessed the extent and nature of nutrition and health claims on the front-of-pack of ‘healthy’ and ‘less-healthy’ packaged foods in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Foods from eight categories were selected from the 2014 Nutritrack database.<br>The internationally standardised International Network for Food and Obesity/Non-Communicable Diseases Research, Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS) taxonomy was used to classify claims on packages.</p>
<p>The Nutrient Profiling Scoring Criterion (NPSC) was used to classify products as ‘healthy’ or ‘less healthy’.</p>
<p>In total, 7526 products were included, with 47 percent (n 3557) classified as ‘healthy’.<br>Out of 7058 individual claims, the majority (69 percent) were found on ‘healthy’ products.</p>
<p>Cereals displayed the greatest proportion of nutrition and health claims (1503 claims on 564 products), of which one-third were displayed on ‘less-healthy’ cereals.</p>
<p>More than one-third of products displayed at least one nutrition claim and 15 percent featured at least one health claim on the front-of-pack.</p>
<p>Claims were found on one-third of ‘less-healthy’ products; 26 percent of those products displayed nutrition claims and seven percent featured health claims.</p>
<p>About 45 percent of ‘healthy’ products displayed nutrition claims and 23 percent featured health claims.</p>
