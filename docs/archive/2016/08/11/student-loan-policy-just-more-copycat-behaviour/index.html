<p><strong>Thursday, 11 August 2016, 8:59 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters</p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>10 AUGUST 2016  </p>
<p>Student Loan Policy Just More Copycat Behaviour</p>
<p>The Labour Party’s new policy on student loans is just copycat behaviour that National has also been prone to, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“We are delighted that other parties see New Zealanders will benefit from our well thought through policy – but we would like some acknowledgement,” says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“However, while Labour is only offering to wipe a chunk of a loan if graduates fill public service jobs in the regions, New Zealand First would write-off student loans in areas where there are critical regional shortages.</p>
<p>“Graduates spending five years in such a programme would have their student loan written off.</p>
<p>“That would mean many will be settled and will stay there.”</p>
