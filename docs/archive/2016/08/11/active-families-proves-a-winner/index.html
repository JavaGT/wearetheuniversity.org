<p><strong>Active Families proves a winner</strong></p>
<p>Massey University is helping families adopt healthy eating practices through a newly formed partnership between the Master of Science Nutrition and Dietetics programme and Sport Auckland’s Green Prescription (GRx) Active Families programme.</p>
<p>Ten dietetic students have designed, delivered and evaluated the programme, which aims to increase physical activity and nutritional knowledge for families in Auckland’s Mt Roskill.</p>
<p>Dietetic practice coordinator at Massey’s Institute of Food Science and Technology Reena Soniassy-Unkovich, says the programme combines physical activity aimed at children, with interactive nutrition and cooking workshops for parents, caregivers and families.</p>
<p>“Obesity is a leading health concern, with adult and child obesity prevalence ranking New Zealand in the top five in the world. The New Zealand Health Survey shows that obesity rates are greatest for those living in the most deprived areas of the country, with children from low income families having a five-fold increase in the risk of developing obesity,” Mrs Soniassy-Unkovich says.</p>
<p>There are multiple GRx programmes run throughout different suburbs of Auckland. Sport Auckland started the programme for Glen Innes, and wished to extend it to Mt Roskill. It was considered a prime location for the programme due to its large ethnic diversity, and spread of different income levels..</p>

<p>According to the 2012 electorate profile, approximately 40 per cent of the total Mt Roskill population identified as being of Asian ethnicity, with nearly 15 per cent identifying as Pacific people, and six per cent as Māori. Predominantly, Mt Roskill is a more socially deprived area – 63 per cent of the communities in the suburb are classified as having a national deprivation score of six or above; with one being least deprived, and 10 being the most deprived areas of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Mrs Soniassy-Unkovich says an examination of past and current school and community-based programmes showed that education combined with a family approach is more likely to reflect sustainable behavioural change.</p>
<p>“The students explored the needs of local families, allowing for the development of 10 nutrition sessions, which included both nutrition workshops and cooking sessions, as well as a physical activity component. Practical resources were produced alongside each session to reinforce the main learning points and support the families to put these into practice at home,” Mrs Soniassy-Unkovich says.</p>
<p>Following the programme, a preliminary evaluation was carried out, which demonstrated that the participants enjoyed the sessions and learnt a lot from the programme.</p>
<p>“The families felt that it was helpful, effective and inspiring. They especially liked the practical, whole food and meal-based approach as opposed to a focus on nutrients. The families all reported having made positive changes to their lifestyles following participation in the programme. They felt confident about committing to those changes in the long term, which is really encouraging,” Mrs Soniassy-Unkovich says.</p>
<p>“Overall, the development of the Mt Roskill Active Families programme has been a success. The programme has proven to be feasible, sustainable and equitable, and has received lots of positive feedback from participants.”</p>
<p>Mrs Soniassy-Unkovich says the Massey Nutrition and Dietetics degree develops dietitians of the future. “We seek to equip students with the skills needed to build healthy communities through strong partnerships and a range of real-life experiences. The development of the Mount Roskill Active Families programme reflected this ethos completely.</p>
<p>“The students all agreed that this experience has not only been valuable for their learning but also very rewarding. It allowed them to immerse themselves into a community and experience the various issues families face in trying to improve their health. It also provided an excellent opportunity to be a part of the drive towards shaping healthier and happier communities,” Mrs Soniassy-Unkovich says.</p>
<p>Sport Auckland Active Families programme coordinator Christina Croll says the collaboration between Sport Auckland and Massey University was hugely influential, and not only supported the Active Families programme but several families within the Mt Roskill community.</p>
<p>“The work that the dietetic students accomplished was of significant value to the programme, both in terms of sustainability and in supporting the community to make a positive change. The students effectively utilised their theoretical learning and with initiative and creativity, developed a curriculum that families found fun, interactive and informational.</p>
<p>“The families also felt empowered by the practical tools and solutions offered. It is without doubt that the benefits of the students’ work will be far reaching within the Mt Roskill community,” Ms Croll says.</p>
