<p>Green Party Bill puts renters’ rights on the agenda</p>
<p>A Green Party Member’s Bill pulled from the ballot today will put renters’ rights firmly on the political agenda, where it belongs.</p>
<p>Metiria Turei’s <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/proposed-members-bills/document/51HOH_MEMBILL252_1/residential-tenancies-safe-and-secure-rentals-amendment">Residential Tenancies (Safe and Secure Rentals) Amendment Bill</a> strengthens tenants’ rights, and will lead to stable, long-term tenancies that are good for both renters and landlords. The 2013 Census records 453,135 households as renters, an increase from 388,275 in the 2006 Census.</p>
<p>“My Bill will help people who rent get the stability they need to put down roots in their community,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
<p>“The home ownership rate is reducing and more families are renting – those families’ rights need be protected so they too can have a stable and secure home life.</p>
<p>“Families who rent often find themselves pushed around from house to house, and their kids moved from school to school, unable to settle down.</p>
<p>“The rental market is the other side of the housing crisis that affects hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“In many other countries, particularly in Europe, long-term tenancies in quality, warm homes are the norm.</p>
<p>“Landlords benefit too when tenancies are stable and long term, because the property gets looked after and there are no time gaps when tenants aren’t paying rent.</p>

<p>“Home ownership is at the lowest level since 1951 and everyone deserves a home to call their own – whether they rent or buy,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
<p>The Bill makes six changes:</p>
<p>1. Allowing tenants a right of first refusal when their lease expires.</p>
<p>2. Requiring landlords to be transparent about how they calculate rent rises.</p>
<p>3. Removing obligations on tenants to pay leasing fees.</p>
<p>4. Creating a default lease term of three years, with the ability to choose a shorter term.</p>
<p>5. Preventing rent increases more often than once every 12 months for periodic and fixed-term tenancies.</p>
<p>6. Restoring the 90-day notice period when landlords wish to sell the property.</p>
