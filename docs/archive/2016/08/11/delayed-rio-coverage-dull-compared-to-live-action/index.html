<p>Delayed Rio Coverage Dull Compared to Live Action</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders wanted to see live action of the New Zealand men’s sevens rugby team in the Olympics at Rio today but were again denied, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“The match against Fiji did not go New Zealand’s way yet the majority of New Zealanders who do not have Sky had to wait nearly an hour to see delayed coverage on Prime,” says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Sports and Recreation Clayton Mitchell.</p>
<p>“There is nothing like viewing the action live – it’s exciting and makes it all the more dramatic but most New Zealanders miss out because the government won’t ensure free-to-view live broadcasts of major sports.</p>
<p>“And we are going to miss out when we strike gold at Rio.</p>
<p>“In Britain, the BBC is providing more than 3000 hours of live sporting action. Channel Seven in Australia is streaming 900 hours of free-to-air coverage and Canada has 23 free live-streaming channels on the Olympics.</p>
<p>“We’re just getting second class treatment here because of the government,” Mr Mitchell says.</p>
