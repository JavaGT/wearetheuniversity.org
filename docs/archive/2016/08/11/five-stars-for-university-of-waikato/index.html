<p><strong>Five stars for University of Waikato</strong></p>
<p>The University of Waikato’s international strengths have been affirmed with a recent five star rating from Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World Rankings.</p>
<p>The QS Stars Rankings rates universities across a broad range of criteria, including teaching quality and satisfaction, employability, research, internationalisation, facilities, innovation and inclusiveness.</p>
<p>In the QS Stars audit process, the University of Waikato was awarded a full five stars for its high reputation for employability, cutting-edge facilities, internationally-renowned research, outstanding teaching and student satisfaction, student inclusiveness and innovation.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley says the five star ranking is a reflection of the strengths the University has in its internationalisation, employability and teaching and learning strategies.</p>
<p>“The five star ranking reinforces Waikato’s place on the world stage, and reflects on us well as we position ourselves amongst other universities around the world,” he says. “Our rankings reflect our ability to prepare our students to answer the big questions and become future-leaders. As always, our focus is on the future and preparing students to be a big part of the future – so continued positive rankings tell us we’re on the right path.”</p>
<p>In 2015’s QS rankings the University achieved the highest rankings increase of all New Zealand universities, moving up 67 places from 405 to 338. The University is also currently ranked among the “most international” universities in the world, has 12 subject areas recognised as being among the world’s best and also ranks well for international student satisfaction.</p>
<p>Rankings play a significant role for universities, particularly in their perception as a quality teaching and research institution. They help reinforce to students that their education is among the best being offered globally, and is seen as particularly important in the decision making process of international students.</p>
