<p>Professor Rosalind Archer</p>
<p>University of Auckland’s head of Engineering Science, Professor Rosalind Archer, has been named the inaugural Energy Engineer of the Year at the Deloitte Energy Excellence Awards.</p>
<p>She is the first academic to be named in the awards, in a category sponsored by the Institute of Professional Engineers. The awards ceremony was held yesterday.</p>
<p>Professor Archer is head of Engineering Science at the Faculty of Engineering at the University and a specialist in reservoir engineering. She holds the Mercury Chair in geothermal reservoir engineering and is the Director of the Geothermal Institute. She is also a director of New Zealand Oil &amp; Gas.</p>
<p>Professor Archer has a PhD in Petroleum Engineering with a PhD minor in Geological and Environmental Science from Stanford University and a Bachelor of Engineering in Engineering Science from the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>She is involved in a range of geothermal research including the ‘Geothermal Supermodels’ project, a collaboration between the University and GNS Science, and she works with Los Alamos National Laboratories addressing micro-seismic activity.</p>
<p>She has been on the programme committee for several major international conferences and has published on reservoir engineering for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>“I am delighted to have received this honour and am particularly pleased to be the first academic researcher to be named Energy Engineer of the Year at these awards,” she says.</p>
<p>“The award, which was a wonderful surprise, also recognises the energy and support of a large cast of staff and students at the University whom I have the pleasure to work with.”</p>
