<p>Government wahakura backtrack a win for families</p>
<p>The Green Party is pleased Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has decided to finally allow wahakura – sleeping pods for babies – to be funded as part of a nationwide effort to reduce our high rate of Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI).</p>
<p>Funding wahakura for every newborn in New Zealand is established Green Party policy, while many health and child advocates have also called for the Government to reverse its longheld opposition to the baby sleeping pods.</p>
<p>“There will be families all over the country who will be grateful today that Minister Coleman has decided to re-think his position on wahakura,” said Green Party Maori development spokesperson Marama Davidson.</p>
<p>“This decision is long overdue. Children’s health experts and the Green Party have been saying for years that wahakura save lives.</p>
<p>“New Zealand has a shockingly high rate of SUDI, and the Government should be doing everything in its power to change that.</p>
<p>“Maori babies make up more than 60 per cent of all cot deaths – that’s a national shame and it can’t be allowed to continue.</p>
<p>“I want to acknowledge the work of all of the children’s health experts who have lobbied the Government for wahakura funding for some time, particularly Dr David Tipene-Leach.</p>
<p>“Professor Ed Mitchell, from the University of Auckland, should also be congratulated for convincing the Minister in their meeting last week that wahakura is worth investing in.</p>
<p>“There’s still work to be done to ensure that no baby dies from SUDI in Aotearoa, but funding wahakura is a big step towards making that possible,” said Ms Davidson.  </p>
