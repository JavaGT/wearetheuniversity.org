<p>Tracey Martin MP<br>Spokesperson for Education<br>10 AUGUST 2016</p>
<p>New Zealand First puts forward the Salisbury Solution to save school</p>
<p>New Zealand First pledges its full support to keep Salisbury Residential School, in Richmond, Nelson, as a single sex boarding facility for girls with high and complex needs, says Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“The government wants to close the school for no valid reason – we propose the Salisbury Solution.</p>
<p>“We want the government to remove the sinking lid entitlement scheme and roadblock of the Intensive Wrap Around. We want parents to be able to apply directly to Salisbury, under its previously strict criteria, as a matter of choice.</p>
<p>&quot;Education Minister Hekia Parata claims parents are not interested in sending their daughters to Salisbury, but she has manipulated the system to make enrolment almost impossible.</p>
<p>“She needs to prove her point in a fair way by allowing free access – the enrolment numbers will prove her right or wrong.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First wants Salisbury to stay open and remain a dedicated facility for young women. Young women already face enough barriers in gaining access to these services so it is our view that a single-sex safe environment is the right provision for Salisbury.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that these young ladies deserve the same choice as their mainstream and private school peers who do not have high needs,&quot; says Mrs Martin.</p>
<p>“Our research shows that any suggestion that the Salisbury Solution is unaffordable is nonsense.</p>
<p>“If Salisbury could directly enrol and retain referrals from the Intensive Wrap Around service the 24/7 highly skilled care that these young women receive would equate to $9.60 per hour. That is far below the $36 per hour for only six hours a day for school days only being touted as affordable by Minister Parata.”</p>
<p>What is the “Salisbury Solution”:</p>
<p>A specialist residential education facility solely for the education and care of young people with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability and requests that:<br>· The MOE agrees Salisbury can re-establish its own Enrolment Committee and process as a self-governing school with an elected parental Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>· That the MOE supports Salisbury’s enhanced focus as a specialist residential education facility for students with ASD (autism spectrum disorder) and ID (intellectual disability).</p>
<p>· The MOE supports Salisbury’s new direction by continuing to fund a notional roll of no less than 30 students.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
