<p>Heart Foundation funding of more than $400,000 to improve cardiac treatments was awarded to University of Auckland researchers today.</p>
<p>Key projects funded include; research into the effectiveness of a mobile phone delivered surgery rehabilitation programme called Text4Heart; a study of cardiac pacemaker technology to improve the efficiency of pacemakers; and a study that screens for structural heart disease among people with atrial fibrillation.</p>
<p>These grants were part of the Heart Foundation’s announcement of $1.5 million in new funding nationally for life-saving research into heart disease - New Zealand’s leading cause of death.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Ralph Maddison received a project grant to test the effectiveness of the Text4Heart programme aimed at helping people with heart disease to make and maintain positive lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>The Text4Heart intervention was designed to educate patients about their cardiovascular risk factors and encourage lifestyle change, and reduces cardiovascular deaths and hospital readmissions by 25 percent.</p>
<p>“But patient attendance at cardiac rehabilitation programmes is minimal, often due to a lack of time or transport to attend centre-based sessions,” says Dr Maddison. “Mobile technology potentially offers a solution.”</p>
<p>This study will determine the sustained effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this mobile phone delivered programme to enhance self-management of cardiovascular disease compared to usual care.</p>
<p>The cardiac pacemaker study led by Dr Rohit Ramchandra may change the way cardiac pacemakers are used in people with heart disease.</p>
<p>“We have the potential to transform pacing strategies in cardiovascular disease globally,” says Dr Ramchandra from the Department of Physiology at the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, the new research could benefit more than 80,000 people who are affected by heart failure.</p>
<p>Funding was also awarded to Dr Katrina Poppe (in Epidemiology and Biostatistics) who will use a hand-carried echocardiography tool to assess the prevalence of structural heart disease in people with atrial fibrillation - one of New Zealand’s fastest-growing forms of heart disease.</p>
<p>Heart Foundation Medical Director Gerry Devlin says ongoing research is critical in efforts to reduce deaths from heart disease in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Research is vital because it allows us to learn more about the causes of different heart conditions, then get better at preventing and treating them. Thanks to our generous supporters, we’re able to continue funding high-calibre research right here in New Zealand.”</p>
<p>He says this year’s applications aligned strongly with the Heart Foundation’s mission to prevent premature deaths from heart disease and offer a better quality of life to those living with it.</p>
<p>“Among the research projects and Fellowships we’re funding, there’s a particular emphasis on reducing inequalities in cardiovascular (CVD) rates – between ethnicities, socio-economic groups, genders, and even between those with and without mental illness.”</p>
