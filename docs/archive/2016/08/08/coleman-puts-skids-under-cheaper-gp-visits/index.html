<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>7 August 2016</p>
<p>Coleman puts skids under cheaper GP visits</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders with high health needs are missing out on cheaper GP fees as the cost of going to the doctor hits $70, Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“The number of practices subsidised to provide the very low cost access (VLCA) scheme has been capped since 2009.</p>
<p>“The result is some 434,040 high needs patients who should be able to access cheaper visits are not enrolled in a practice that qualifies for the subsidy.</p>
<p>“Perversely it also means patients who are not categorised as high needs will often be enrolled at a VLCA practice, while some of those practices are themselves struggling due to funding cuts.</p>
<p>“The system has been allowed to become inequitable and unfair, and the blame sits squarely with Jonathan Coleman.</p>
<p>“A report he received almost a year ago from a high level working group reviewing primary care recommended he change the way VLCA was targeted, plus he ignored Treasury advice to bid for extra Budget funding to do it.</p>
<p>“Not only that, but he told doctors that any changes would probably have to made under a different Health Minister.</p>
<p>“National has cut $1.7 billion from Health across six years. Primary health care is the first step on the ladder to keeping people well.</p>
<p>“Insufficient funding in primary health leads to major costs down the track. For Jonathan Coleman to fob this off as being someone else’s problem is beyond pathetic.</p>
<p>“He needs to man up and provide some solutions right now,” Annette King said.</p>
