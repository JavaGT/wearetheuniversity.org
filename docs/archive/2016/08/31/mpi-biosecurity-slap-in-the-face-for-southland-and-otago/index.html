<p>MPI Biosecurity Slap in the Face for Southland and Otago</p>
<p>The Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) refusal to hold consultation meetings in Southland or Otago as part of their Biosecurity 2025 consultation project is an insult to the region, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“MPI’s decision comes in spite of the region suffering a significant velvetleaf incursion in the past year.</p>
<p>“All regions deserve a say in identifying future biosecurity risks and prevention strategies,” says Ria Bond New Zealand First List MP based in Invercargill.</p>
<p>“The Southland/Otago regional economy is heavily invested in agriculture, be it through beef, lamb and dairy farming, viticulture and fruit growing, all of which are susceptible to biosecurity threats.</p>
<p>“Our region caters to a huge number of tourists and we have ports bringing in overseas products constantly. We really are at the frontline of the changing risks around biosecurity and we should have a say in the policy and future of biosecurity.</p>
<p>“The recent velvetleaf incursion should be a reason to involve southerners in the consultation process, not exclude them.</p>
<p>“MPI claims they are holding meetings where they judge the reach will be greatest. They won’t reach anybody by not coming here at all.</p>
<p>“Biosecurity is a real concern in this part of New Zealand and MPI needs to be told to reconsider”.</p>
<p>“The local National MP is offering some wishy-washy alternative instead of getting stuck into his Government’s department and standing up for Southern farmers. Well if he won’t, New Zealand First will,” says Ms Bond.</p>
