<p>31 August 2016</p>
<p>The University of Auckland has been ranked as the most innovative university in New Zealand and Australia in the inaugural Reuters Top 75: Asia’s Most Innovative Universities rankings.</p>
<p>In the newly-launched rankings, the University of Auckland was placed 27th, ahead of the leading Australian universities. No other New Zealand university was ranked in the top 75.</p>
<p>The ranking is a further endorsement of the University’s ongoing investment and recognition of innovation and entrepreneurship excellence both within the University and in the community.</p>
<p>Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor Jim Metson says: “Research universities can be powerful forces for radical innovation and economic growth and we are delighted that this university has been recognised as a leader in this area. This is a fantastic achievement for the University of Auckland and our researchers.”</p>
<p>The University has developed an innovative culture which includes encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship. Through UniServices, its commercialisation company, the University already has a high-level of connectivity between its researchers and businesses, both nationally and internationally. UniServices has, on behalf of the University, over 1,200 active projects with more than 300 New Zealand firms at any one time.</p>
<p>“We are committed to fostering this entrepreneurial culture within the University, driving the growth of new high-value business, and strengthening our traditional industries through innovation,” adds Professor Metson.</p>
<p>To compile its ranking of Asia’s most innovative universities, Reuters evaluated tertiary institutions on ten different metrics which included the number of basic and global patents filed by the universities, and the percentage of all articles that were written in collaboration with industry.</p>
<p>Six other Australian universities were placed in the Reuters Top 75: Asia’s Most Innovative Universities rankings:</p>
<ul>
<li>University of Sydney (28)</li>
<li>Monash University (32)</li>
<li>University of Queensland (33)</li>
<li>University of Melbourne (34)</li>
<li>University of New South Wales (52)</li>
<li>University of South Australia (74)</li>
</ul>
