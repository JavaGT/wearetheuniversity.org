<p>Media statement</p>

<p>Ōhāriu schools receive funding for Asian languages</p>
<p>National List MP based in Ōhāriu, Brett Hudson, says it’s important our next generation is able to communicate and work in different languages as our international and trading links grow – particularly within the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>“Onslow College, Raroa Normal Intermediate and Crofton Downs Primary School are receiving $197,000 to enable more classes in Japanese and Mandarin as part of the Asian Language Learning in Schools fund,” Mr Hudson said.</p>
<p>“Our local schools are among 63 schools which have received funding from the second round of the $10 million contestable fund. The fund is helping increase Asian language classes in our schools.”</p>
<p>This takes the total number of schools receiving support for Mandarin, Japanese, or Korean programmes to 203.</p>
<p>“It’s great that schools are coming together to share resources and link with community and cultural organisations to make the most of these learning opportunities for students both in Ōhāriu and across New Zealand.</p>
<p>“We are a trading nation, so it’s important our future workforce has the opportunity to learn other languages and understand other cultures.</p>
<p>“These classes will help Ōhāriu students thrive in a global economy,” Mr Hudson said.</p>
