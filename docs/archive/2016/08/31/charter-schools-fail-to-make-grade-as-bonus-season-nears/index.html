<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>31 August 2016</p>
<p>Charter schools fail to make grade as bonus season nears</p>
<p>As charter schools prepare to receive another round of bonuses and the National-Act Government confirms the opening of two new schools, documents quietly released by the Ministry of Education highlight major issues around their performance, Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>“Information we’ve received shows four of eight charter schools have been explicitly identified as being non-compliant with their contracts in some areas and seven are not meeting aspects of their performance standards.</p>
<p>“Many of them are down on their guaranteed roll numbers, while in one case a school that ended 2015 with a roll of just 67 had 15 stand-downs, six suspensions, one exclusion and five expulsions.</p>
<p>“Those are alarming numbers, yet the Ministry has signalled it won’t be telling them to pull their socks up, but will instead just lower the standards it has set.</p>
<p>“The output-focused contracts were a terrible idea in the first place and changing them now would be a policy retreat of embarrassingly large proportions for the Government.</p>
<p>“Still, it’s typical of National to fiddle with the numbers and standards to make things look better. Unfortunately that only leads to a devaluing of education for our children.</p>
<p>“Charter schools received thousands of taxpayer dollars in bonuses last year and Education Minister Hekia Parata looks set to announce another cash injection shortly. Meanwhile state schools are grappling with a funding freeze and face a return to bulk funding.</p>
<p>“The National-ACT charter school deal has been a failure and has no place in our education system,” Chris Hipkins says.</p>
