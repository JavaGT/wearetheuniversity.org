<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>31 AUGUST 2016  </p>

<p><strong>Bill will revitalise forestry sector for New Zealand’s long term gain</strong></p>
<p>Forestry is New Zealand’s third largest export earner making 3.2 per cent of GD.</p>
<p>But it is heading for a crisis.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s forests are being cleaned out mostly by foreign owners.</p>
<p>Eight of the top 10 forest companies are foreign controlled.</p>
<p>One of our greatest former state assets – trees – are being plundered and felled too early.</p>
<p>We have no control, no laws and no careful management of one of our greatest resources.</p>
<p>The government treats our forests as if they are growing a crop of corn.</p>
<p>They are so out of touch they don’t understand it takes 27 years or more to grow a forest.</p>
<p>Raw logs are leaving our ports in huge volumes taking billions of dollars of added value with them that could be kept here.</p>
<p>While wholesale felling goes on, not enough new trees are being planted.</p>
<p>There is a day of reckoning coming when all our exotic forests planted by people of foresight through the 1980s and early 1990s will be gone.</p>
<p>That day of reckoning is not far away either – 2023 – is the year industry sources say the economic crunch will come.</p>
<p>The time to act is now.</p>
<p>Other nations are locking up their forests, planning for their futures.</p>

<p>New Zealand isn’t.</p>
<p>China, our biggest market for logs, has realised they have over-harvested.</p>
<p>They are stopping commercial harvesting in their forests in a prudent manner while aiming to have their output value reach $US1.3 trillion.</p>
<p>Other nations like Chile and Canada have taken similar action.</p>
<p>New Zealand First says it’s time we looked after our forests, to secure jobs and opportunities in our regions for the long term.</p>
<p>Not for quick gain as is happening now.</p>
<p>New Zealand First is taking this matter so seriously we are introducing a new bill – the Forests (Realising Forestry’s Potential) Amendment Bill.</p>
<p>This bill will:</p>
<p>1. Re-establish the Crown’s ability to create state forests on Crown land and on private land with the co-operation of landowners.</p>
<p>This will create much needed jobs in provincial New Zealand and provide a sustainable source of exotic timber.</p>
<p>2. The bill will stop the serious deforestation which is occurring by adopting a quota, licensing and management plan as happens in Canada.</p>
<p>It will also stop the exploitation of our forestry resource.</p>
<p>It will ensure the vast majority of our raw forest products are processed here in New Zealand – not taken overseas where the foreign countries profit from our resource.</p>
<p>3. The bill will require any foreign investment into forest land, as well as farmland, to be subject to the Overseas Investment Act.</p>
<p>The administering department will be a restored New Zealand Forest Service which will have a more active role than at any point in nearly 30 years.</p>
<p>It will be responsible for our exotic timber forests being sustainably managed and not exploited as is happening now.</p>
<p>New Zealand First’s bill will ensure the wealth from our forestry sector will benefit New Zealanders first and foremost – not overseas interests.</p>
<p>The bill will lock in place a secure long term sustainable future for our forests.</p>
<p>If we don’t do this – thousands of hectares in New Zealand will be covered in tree stumps.</p>
<p>The wealth will be gone.</p>
<p>Hundreds of jobs will be lost.</p>
<p>Billions of dollars of income will be lining someone else’s pockets – not New Zealanders’ pockets.</p>
