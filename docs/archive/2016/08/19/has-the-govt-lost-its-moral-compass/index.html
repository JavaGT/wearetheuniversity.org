<p>Has the Govt lost its moral compass?</p>
<p>National’s decision to dismiss concerns about default KiwiSaver funds being invested in the manufacturing of cluster bombs, landmines, and nuclear weapons shows it’s lost its moral compass.</p>
<p>Both John Key and the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Paul Goldsmith yesterday rejected the idea that Government has a responsibility to ensure default KiwiSaver funds are invested ethically, saying instead it&#39;s up to individuals.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t be left as a personal choice to invest in cluster munitions and land mines when those investments result in tens-of-thousands of children being killed and injured every year,” said Green Party finance spokesperson Julie Anne Genter.</p>
<p>“The children killed and maimed by landmines and cluster bombs have little personal choice in the matter.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders expect their Government to have some basic morals. There should be some basic ethical oversight of the default KiwiSaver funds the Government directs New Zealanders’ savings into.</p>
<p>“The Green Party is calling on the Government to set higher ethical investment standards for its default KiwiSaver providers.</p>
<p>“Default KiwiSaver Funds need to be legally invested, at a minimum, and preferably ethically invested, so that New Zealanders have a guarantee that they’re not profiting from human misery.</p>
<p>“The Green Party in Government would establish a public, ethical default KiwiSaver fund,” said Ms Genter.</p>
