<p>Media Release</p>
<p>19 August 2016</p>
<p><em>- for immediate release</em></p>
<p><strong>Dialogue has commenced on refreshing Lincoln University</strong></p>
<p>This week a workshop of members of the Lincoln University Council and the Senior Management Group addressed two matters that are critical to the University’s future: the essential characteristics of specialist land-based tertiary education, and the University’s value proposition for stakeholders.</p>
<p>Participants affirmed that the University will continue to provide specialist land-based teaching and research, and acknowledged that the University must now improve its performance such that it is both academically and financially sustainable.</p>
<p>As of today, the University has initiated a transformation process to strengthen its foundations for the immediate future and for future organisational options. Consultation will include both internal and external stakeholders, whether individuals or groups.</p>
<p>Care will be taken to retain the University’s quality of teaching and research, and to ensure that excellent student experiences and outcomes are improved upon.</p>
<p>The initiatives, some of which are well underway, include rejuvenating the Academic Board consistent with the university being a ‘community of scholars’, increasing programme attractiveness and flexibility, eliminating unpopular courses, and better use of teaching technologies. Overall, the initiatives will lead to reduced costs and ultimately to increased revenue.</p>
<p>Lincoln University will collaborate with other institutions, both in academic and in non-academic areas. It will ensure that its assets are used to maximum advantage, including its farms and properties, its corporate entities, and its fundraising potential.</p>

<p>Lincoln’s main campus near Christchurch requires building improvements as a matter of priority, following dormancy since the 2010/2011 earthquakes. The future of Lincoln’s campus at Telford in South Otago is under early consideration with a view to improving its outcomes, perhaps also under collaborative arrangements.</p>
<p>The University’s priorities include the development of the Lincoln Hub, in partnership with AgResearch, Landcare Research, Plant and Food Research, and DairyNZ. The Lincoln Hub provides opportunities for the University to flourish, including joint research and education opportunities for staff and students alike.</p>
<p>Progress, conversations and reports on Lincoln’s transformation will be regularly updated and logged at <a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/refreshing">http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/refreshing</a>. People interested in contributing their ideas should do so through this site.</p>
