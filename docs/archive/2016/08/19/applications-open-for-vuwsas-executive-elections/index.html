<p>19 August 2016</p>
<p>Applications open for VUWSA’s executive elections</p>
<p>VUWSA is calling for aspiring leaders and those passionate about student life at Victoria to run in the upcoming executive elections.</p>
<p>Nominations for candidates wishing to stand in the 2017 executive opened today at 9am; and nominations close Friday 9 September at 4.30pm.</p>
<p>VUWSA President, Jonathan Gee, says anyone wishing to stand as a candidate in the VUWSA executive should get their nominations in now.</p>
<p>‘We have an incredible pool of talent at Victoria University – dedicated students who are already leaders in their own right at Victoria, and in Wellington,’ Gee says.</p>
<p>‘Standing for the VUWSA executive is a great way to build your leadership skills and make a difference for students at Victoria and in Wellington. We encourage students to come forward now.’</p>
<p>Gee encourages those interested in running to look at the recently launched Strategic Plan 2017-2021, which paints a picture of the future of VUWSA and student voice.</p>
<p>‘VUWSA exists to get the best deal for students. We’re hoping to achieve this in the next five years in a number of ways, including by pushing for a student friendly Wellington.’</p>
<p>As a capital-city students’ association, we should be a leading voice on student issues both within the university and in wider society. We’ve already started this through our campaign for a rental Warrant of Fitness and tertiary discount on public transport for the upcoming local body elections.’</p>
<p>‘Providing Victoria Students and VUWSA members with a choice of candidates is vital. We also hope a pool of high-quality and passionate candidates will drive more students to vote this year.’</p>
<p>VUWSA’s online voting website will go live Tuesday 20 September at 9am and close Thursday 22 September at 4.30pm.</p>
<p>The Association will also hold polling days at Pipitea, Te Aro and Kelburn.</p>
