<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters</p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>19 AUGUST 2016  </p>
<p>Govt Sits on Hands While Immigration Soars</p>
<p>Immigration remains far too high, and public services continue to be overloaded, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“The latest immigration figures will be of no comfort to the tens of thousands seeking to buy a home, obtain meaningful and adequate employment, or to hospitals and doctors who have too many patients queuing for treatment as a result of record immigration and cost cutting by this government.</p>
<p>“In figures just released New Zealand had a net gain of 69,000 in the July year, only 100 less than the June year. This amounts to a 24 record month of immigration which the government like some absurd King Canut refuses to respond to.</p>
<p>“In the month of July there are still over 186 immigrants a day.</p>
<p>“Auckland and now other areas are suffering from a shortage of houses and sky high rents. Over half the immigrants settled in the Super City.</p>
<p>“To use immigration to depress wages through job competition and prop up artificial consumption is not an economic policy but a recipe for economic disaster unfolding monthly before our eyes.</p>
<p>“Every month that goes by with the government refusing to respond with a common sense policy, that is in the interests of all New Zealanders, is probably six future months longer in seeking to redress this appalling demand and supply mismatch – a basic concept which this so-called free market government shows no understanding of.”</p>
