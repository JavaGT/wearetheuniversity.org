<p>Dance Studies at the University of Auckland is hosting the <em>Undisciplining Dance Symposium</em> at the Kenneth Myers Centre from 30th June – 2nd July 2016.</p>
<p><em>What can art do for us? Can the arts enable new value systems? How do the arts provoke and undiscipline us, creating space for us to come together differently in uncertain times?</em></p>
<p>The <em>Undisciplining Dance Symposium</em> brings artists and researchers in the fields of dance, choreography, performance, visual arts, spatial design and architecture together to imagine divergent futures and ways of effecting change and movement.</p>
<p>This unprecedented gathering of international artists in the field of dance, performance and creative arts research rethinks disciplinarity, and the role of the body and live art in todays diverse cultural and political climate.</p>
<p>The Symposium will mobilise inspired, fluid, surprising and inclusive approaches to arts research through presentations, performances, workshops and performative lectures by leading international artists and scholars.</p>
<p>International keynote presenters offer diverse perspectives from Europe, the Americas and the Pacific.</p>
<p>• Artist and Māori scholar, Dr Moana Nepia from the University of Hawaii will open the symposium with a special performative event at Waipapa Marae.</p>
<p>• Globally renowned in the critique of performance studies and choreography Professor André Lepecki from New York University launches his new book ‘Singularities’ and speaks to the significant political movements of experimental performance.</p>
<p>• Swedish artist Efva Lilja will perform her solo, <em>There once was: A House, A Cow, A Woman</em> and present a lecture about the role of art and research in politically complex and troubled times.</p>
<p>Efva Lilja will also be presenting a professional development workshop for contemporary dance artists and performers at Wellesley Street Studios during her stay with the support of Creative New Zealand.</p>
