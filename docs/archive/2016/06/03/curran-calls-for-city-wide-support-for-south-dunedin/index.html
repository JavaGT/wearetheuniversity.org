<p>Clare Curran<br>MP for Dunedin South</p>
<p>MEDIA STATEMENT<br>3 June 2016</p>
<p>Curran calls for city-wide support for South Dunedin on first anniversary of 3 June flood</p>
<p>Dunedin South MP Clare Curran has called for Dunedin people to actively back South Dunedin as a vibrant part of Dunedin with a strong future.</p>
<p>“All city leaders, including city councillors should be able to publicly say whether they believe the city should ensure the wider South Dunedin area remains a crucial set of suburbs providing homes for at least 13% of the city, businesses, schools and other services.</p>
<p>“I am today challenging the city’s local politicians to tell South Dunedin it is valued and that the city will make concrete decisions to invest in upgrading infrastructure and new developments in the near future.</p>
<p>“The city could start by announcing it will redevelop its social housing in South Dunedin to demonstrate good faith to the community and to provide a template for new urban development with warm, dry homes and improved community design for some of our most vulnerable local people.</p>
<p>“The city could also start work on a much-needed community centre.</p>
<p>The government needs to commit resources to assisting local authorities plan for the longer term.</p>
<p>“Friday 3 June is the first anniversary of the flood event which affected many parts of Dunedin, but hit South Dunedin the hardest.</p>
<p>“Best estimates based on the number of insurance claims are that more than 1000 homes and hundreds of businesses were flooded. Thousands of people had their lives disrupted, some are still badly affected one year on. There is estimate to be at least 15,000 people living on the South Dunedin flat area.</p>

<p>“The value of the assets above the ground in South Dunedin is considerable; including houses, businesses and infrastructure, at least five schools and a significant waste pumping station. There are nearly 400 businesses employing almost 3000 people in South Dunedin alone.</p>
<p>“Adding in Forbury, Caversham, St Kilda, Andersons Bay, Caledonian and St Clair totals more than 1400 businesses employing more than 7000 people (Statistics NZ).</p>
<p>“It has been a torturous job to uncover the causes of the flooding and for the community this has meant ongoing stress and anxiety that the poor maintenance of Council-owned infrastructure would not be recognised and dealt with properly before another major rain event.</p>
<p>“A public meeting on 7 March resulted in the formation of the South Dunedin Action Group which has now met twice with the city council in an attempt to find answers for the flooding, seek accountability and a timeframe for a plan for South Dunedin’s future.</p>
<p>“Following the floods, a growing number of people concerned about the future of this part of Dunedin have begun voicing their views. I urge more people across the city to get involved and stand up for this part of our city, which is the gateway to our coastline.</p>
<p>“No-one denies there are longer term issues facing the flattest part of our city with slowly rising groundwater and coastline erosion. There are solutions to these issues. Central Government needs to come to the table.</p>
<p>“But we need to start by backing ourselves and our city. South Dunedin needs your support now.”</p>
