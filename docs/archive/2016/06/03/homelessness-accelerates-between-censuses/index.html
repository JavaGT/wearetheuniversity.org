<p><strong>Homelessness accelerates between censuses</strong></p>
<p>At least one in every 100 New Zealanders were homeless at the latest census in 2013, compared with 1 in 120 in 2006, and 1 in 130 in 2001, say University of Otago, Wellington (UOW) researchers.</p>
<p>UOW researcher Dr Kate Amore, from the Health Research Council-funded He Kainga Oranga/Housing and Health Research Programme, measured the ‘severely housing deprived’ population.</p>
<p>“Homelessness is worsening in New Zealand in terms of both numbers and as a proportion of the population. This upward trend accelerated between the 2006 and 2013 censuses, compared with the 2001 and 2006 period,” Dr Amore says.</p>
<p>“If the homeless population were a hundred people, 70 are staying with extended family or friends in severely crowded houses, 20 are in a motel, boarding house or camping ground, and 10 are living on the street, in cars, or in other improvised dwellings. They all urgently need affordable housing.”</p>
<p>“The Government needs to develop a comprehensive housing strategy that recognises the fundamental importance of good quality, low-cost homes. New affordable houses are understandably not being provided by private developers. Housing for all is essential to New Zealander’s health and wellbeing as well as the country’s prosperity.</p>
<p>If no government action is taken this crisis is likely to deepen.”</p>
<p>These numbers are based on the official New Zealand definition of homelessness developed by Statistics New Zealand, Housing New Zealand and the Ministry of Social Development.</p>
<p>These numbers do not include those living in emergency accommodation such as night shelters. This group will be the subject of a subsequent report.</p>
<p>More detailed homelessness statistics for 2013 will be published later in June 2016 on the University of Otago website.</p>
<p>The latest study was funded by a Lottery grant and follows an Official Statistics Programme report published in 2013, <em>Severe housing deprivation: The problem and its measurement</em>, available from <a href="http://www.statisphere.govt.nz">www.statisphere.govt.nz</a>.</p>
