<p><strong>MP for Dunedin North</strong><br><strong>Economic Development Spokesperson</strong><br>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>2 June 2016</p>
<p><strong>1 in 3 working Kiwis short changed by $1000s</strong></p>
<p>With more than 700,000 Kiwis potentially underpaid to the tune of over $2b the Government has to come up with a proper solution to pay the one in three working New Zealanders short-changed by the holiday payroll disaster, says Labour’s Economic Development spokesperson David Clark.</p>
<p>“The Government tinkered with the law in 2009 but they made the issue worse. Since then they have done nothing but sit on their hands and watch the problem grow.</p>
<p>“The effect of Government inaction is that hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders have been underpaid every year. The Government estimates most affected would have been underpaid by $250 to $500 a year. Legally, working people can claim back six years of underpayments.</p>
<p>“That means hundreds of thousands of Kiwis are due a few thousand dollars.</p>
<p>“The Government will try to blame employers but ultimately they must take responsibility because they are in charge of guiding business and enforcing the law.</p>
<p>“Before the Government attributes blame they should take a look at themselves because MBIE – the ministry in charge of enforcing the law – has itself underpaid its employees.</p>
<p>“Now the full extent is clear, Steven Joyce needs to put his so-called Mr Fixit hat on and deal with this. We need a clear plan to get that money back into the pockets of those who earned it,” says David Clark.</p>
