<p><strong>Top Science graduate wins 2016 France Friendship Fund Excellence Scholarship</strong></p>
<p>The 2016 New Zealand France Friendship Fund Excellence Scholarship has been awarded to Benjamin Wilson from the University of Canterbury.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old student has been awarded $25,000 to complete his PhD in supramolecular chemistry at the University of Bordeaux and the University of Canterbury.</p>
<p>Ben earned a Bachelor of Science degree with First Class Honours from the University of Canterbury, graduating top of his class. He was awarded the Roper Scholarship to undertake his PhD studies at the University of Canterbury (UC).</p>
<p>A former head prefect of Shirley Boys’ High School in Christchurch, Ben was given direct entry into second year Chemistry at UC in recognition of his outstanding academic performance in his final year at secondary school.</p>
<p>UC Chemistry Professor Paul Kruger of the College of Science says Ben is one of the most capable students he has taught.</p>
<p>Ben has selected the CNRS Institutes, <em>The Centre de Recherche Paul Pascal, CRPP, and the Institut de Chimie de la Matière Condensée, ICMCB</em>, based at the University of Bordeaux, for their expertise and knowledge in the area of magneto-chemistry. He will be jointly supervised by Professor Kruger at UC and Dr Rodolphe Clérac and Professor Corine Mathonière from the University of Bordeaux. This co-supervision arrangement will further strengthen the ongoing international collaboration between the research groups.</p>

<p>In addition to his scientific studies, Ben studied French throughout high school and took part in a school exchange to France, where he stayed with a French family in the town of Bourges. He is looking forward to immersing himself in French culture again when he spends time in Bordeaux during his studies.</p>
<p>The New Zealand France Friendship Fund’s Excellence Scholarship was established in 2009 to support one New Zealand postgraduate student’s study at PhD or Master’s level in France. It is a reciprocal scholarship, and each year a French postgraduate student is given the opportunity to study in New Zealand.</p>
