<p><strong>Bishop congratulates local civil defence award winner</strong></p>
<p>Chris Bishop, National List MP based in the Hutt Valley has congratulated Lower Hutt resident Professor David Johnston for receiving a silver Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) award last night in Wellington.</p>
<p>“I am delighted Professor Johnston has been recognised for his outstanding services to emergency management,” says Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>“David has made a significant contribution to emergency management over the past quarter of a century. He is consistently an outstanding contributor to our community and I am glad he has been awarded with this recognition.</p>
<p>“In a field which is increasingly relevant to our region, David was a key contributor to the third World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in 2015 in Japan, and the follow-up New Zealand Symposium held in Wellington last year.”</p>
<p>The event saw three recipients from around New Zealand presented with a silver CDEM award.</p>
<p>“Along with the other recipients, Professor Johnston has served his country with superb skills and knowledge, and a genuine dedication to protect people’s lives and livelihoods,” says Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>“Emergency management is a cornerstone of New Zealand’s resilience to natural disasters. Last evening’s winners are a reflection of New Zealand’s strong community spirit, and the commitment and relationships that enable individuals across science, research and emergency management to work together to make a difference.”</p>
