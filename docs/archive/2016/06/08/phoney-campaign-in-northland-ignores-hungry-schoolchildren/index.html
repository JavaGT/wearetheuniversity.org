<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>8 JUNE 2016  </p>
<p><strong>National’s Phoney PR Campaign in Northland Ignores Hungry School Children</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is calling on the government to start doing something about the overwhelming problem of hungry children in Northland.</p>
<p>“When Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye visited Northland College in Kaikohe to mark the start of a building upgrade she said it would be a beautiful place and there would be ‘an explosion of education here’,” says Northland MP and New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“That’s great but sadly there is another explosion happening at Northland College – the number of hungry students turning up for classes.</p>
<p>“The day before Ms Kaye flicked the switch for concrete to be poured more than 70 students were fed at Northland College through a volunteer effort.</p>
<p>“Central government in Wellington is ignoring the most pressing problems for towns like Kaikohe – lack of jobs and families living in poverty.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters also says it’s a pity Ms Kaye did not go to nearby Tautoro Primary School where half the pupils have to be fed every day.</p>
<p>“The school principal says when she took the job four years ago she thought it was a parenting issue but realises now children are simply not getting enough to eat at home because there is not enough money.</p>
<p>“Four years ago 15-20 children needed feeding at school now and then – now 35-45 need feeding every day – out of a roll of 75 pupils.</p>

<p>“Even the parents who have jobs don’t have enough money to provide for their children because of the low wages in the area.</p>
<p>“Tautoro School was a Decile 1B school but that has been changed to Decile1C – which means it will receive $9,000 less in government funding. The change has never been explained.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says the National Party is trying to win back hearts, minds and votes in Northland with a staged public relations campaign whilst doing next to nothing for hungry children and poor families.</p>
<p>“Politicians show how out of touch they are when they use the term ‘child poverty’ – it’s not child poverty it is family poverty. One would hope they’d understand the sadness of this situation,” says Mr Peters.</p>
