<p><strong>Equal pay principles big step forward for fair pay</strong></p>
<p>7 June 2016</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa says the pay equity principles recommended by the Joint Working Group on Pay Equity are a welcome and significant move forward in ensuring women are fairly paid for their work.</p>
<p>National President Louise Green says it is great news for the thousands of underpaid workers in female-dominated occupations.</p>
<p>“We now have a framework and a set of principles that provide a constructive way forward. We strongly encourage the Government to endorse the principles and adopt them into the Equal Pay Act.&quot;</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa lodged a claim on behalf of Ministry of Education support workers with the Employment Relations Authority last October following Kristine Bartlett’s win in the Supreme Court against aged care provider Terranova.</p>
<p>“Education support workers employed by the Ministry of Education earn an estimated $8 an hour less than a comparable male-dominated job and that’s why we lodged the case with the court.”</p>
<p>“We are aware that paying workers in female dominated occupations a fair wage will have resource implications but this is about us as a just society choosing fairness for all women by ensuring equal pay for work of equal value.</p>
<p>“Women across New Zealand will now be looking forward to seeing the Government adopt the principles and seeing quick progress on implementing pay equity.&quot;</p>
