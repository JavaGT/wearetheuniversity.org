<p><strong>Conservatorium of Music Presents the Marriage of Figaro</strong></p>
<p>Mozart’s famous opera buffa, <em>The Marriage of Figaro,</em> takes to the stage this month when the University of Waikato’s Conservatorium of Music holds its annual opera production.</p>
<p>Performed by the Conservatorium’s senior vocal students, <em>The Marriage of Figaro</em> is a work-shopped production that has been put together in an intensive six week timeframe, as part of Dame Malvina Major’s new Opera Studies course.</p>
<p>The course is the only one of its kind in New Zealand and now offered at the University of Waikato. It is designed for vocal students who are either pre or post auditions for overseas young artists’ programmes, with the aim of preparing them for what it is like to be under the intense pressure of an opera singer.</p>
<p>“Unlike a professional opera concert, <em>The Marriage of Figaro</em> is the accumulation of a learning period and a showcase of how an opera is put together. It will give the audience a glimpse into what happens behind the scenes, as well as the difficulties faced by budding opera singers - providing a unique viewing experience,” says Dame Malvina Major.</p>
<p>Performed in Italian, <em>The Marriage of Figaro</em> tells the story of servants Figaro and Susanna who attempt to foil the advances of Count Almaviva. The role of Le nozze di Figaro will be performed by Malaysian-born Baritone Clinton Fung, who has recently returned from the New Zealand Opera’s nationwide tour of the <em>Elixir of Love</em>. Sir Howard Morrison Scholar and Hillary Medalist Blaire White will play the role of his wife-to-be Susanna and Eliza Boom, recent winner of the Becroft Grand Opera and North Shore Aria Competitions, stars as Countess Almaviva. Other cast members include Kolitha Jayatunge, Helene Holman, Amy Thomas, Noah Filimoehala, Anna Mahon and Cecily Shaw, as well as guest artist Joel Amosa from Auckland, who is singing the role of the Count.</p>
<p>“I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to work with other likeminded singers who are of a similar age, and who are exploring their voices in the world of opera. The high calibre of tutors we have been exposed to each week has surpassed any expectation I had when first enrolling in the course,” says cast member Mezzo Soprano Helene Holman, who plays Cherubino.</p>
<p>The production is directed by Kararaina Walker and accompanied by Francis Cowan. Italian libretti coached by internationally celebrated flautist Luca Manghi, with pianist David Kelly in charge of the repertoire. Cherie Cook of Costume Designs supplied the costumes.</p>
<p><em>The Marriage of Figaro</em> is on Friday 17 June at 7.30pm and Sunday 19 June at 6pm in the Dr John Gallagher Concert Chamber, Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts, Hamilton.
