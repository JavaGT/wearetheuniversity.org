<p><strong>Which children will miss out when funding is redistributed?</strong></p>
<p>20 July 2016</p>
<p>Papers just released for the Government&#39;s review of education funding raise the question of which children will lose out when the pie is resliced.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is proposing to redistribute funding. This means that because there will be no increase in overall funding, some students will miss out,&quot; says NZEI Te Riu Roa National Secretary Paul Goulter.</p>
<p>“The Minister’s paper to Cabinet talks about directing funding to the ‘size of the education challenge’ rather than the ‘size of their rolls and the costs of their inputs’. We have long lobbied for additional funding for special needs and schools that serve disadvantaged communities, but never at the expense of other schools, which already find it hard enough deliver a 21st Century education under their current budgets.”</p>
<p>NZEI’s fundamental commitment on behalf of its members is to maintain and enhance free and equitable access to education for all children regardless of their personal circumstances.</p>
