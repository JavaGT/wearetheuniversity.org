<p><strong>International appointment for Waikato University literacy educator</strong></p>
<p>Te Kura Toi Tangata Faculty of Education Senior Lecturer Sue Dymock was appointed as an Academy Fellow of the International Academy for Research in Learning Disabilities this week, joining a group of 300 world leaders engaged in the scientific study of learning disabilities.</p>
<p>Dr Dymock says it&#39;s humbling to receive international recognition for the literacy research she has done with New Zealand children. &quot;Ultimately, my goal is to help children, especially our Kiwi children to develop age-appropriate reading skills. It&#39;s very difficult to access the curriculum if you cannot read. It&#39;s been my research focus for the past three decades, and I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to be supported in this pursuit by the faculty and wider University.&quot;</p>
<p>To become an Academy Fellow, individuals are nominated by Fellows or Members and are recommended to the Academy Fellows’ Committee, with the nomination considered on the basis of the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. Is a leading researcher, recognised nationally and/or internationally for his/her contribution to the scientific knowledge and understanding of learning disabilities, and</p>
<p>2. Has achieved scholarly distinction in the field of learning disabilities, and</p>
<p>3. Has made a distinguished contribution to learning disabilities research, and</p>
<p>4. Has published research articles in peer-reviewed journals in the academic literature.</p>
<p>Dr Dymock is looking forward to new international networking opportunities and intends on attending next year&#39;s annual conference for the first time.</p>
