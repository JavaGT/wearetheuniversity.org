<p>Minister Shows She’s Out of Touch on Class Sizes</p>
<p>Education Minister Hekia Parata has got it all wrong about class sizes – she just does not know how schools operate, says Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“She is living in a world of bureaucratic theory, and is out of touch with the real world of New Zealand schools.</p>
<p>“The Minister is unable to comprehend that under the current teacher/student funding ratio Principals have no alternative but to load classrooms with students, well above the recommended class size. Only when they have another 15 to 29 students enrolled at their school can they form another class.</p>
<p>“State schools manage this reality as best they can. It is unfair of the Minister to give the impression to parents that large classes are created by Principals when it is her government’s funding model at fault.</p>
<p>“Rather than lower the ratios by increasing funding for state school staffing the Minister proposes to give more taxpayer dollars to private schools to further support their lower class sizes.”</p>
