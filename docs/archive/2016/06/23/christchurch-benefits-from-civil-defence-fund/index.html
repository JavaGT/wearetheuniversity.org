<p>Christchurch benefits from civil defence fund</p>
<p>Environment Canterbury is one of the successful applicants to receive funding through the 2016 Resilience Fund.</p>
<p>“I am delighted Environment Canterbury has been recognised for their outstanding work to enhance Canterbury’s resilience to civil emergency hazards,” says Nuk Korako, National List MP based in the Port Hills.</p>
<p>Environment Canterbury received $85,000 for the Paleo-Tsunami project. This project aims to bring together all known information about paleo-tsunamis both nationally and internationally to help configure, design, and implement an online database.</p>
<p>“It’s important to recognise that some of the best work towards enhancing New Zealand’s resilience is happening in our regions. That’s why this National-led Government is supporting communities to continue this great work, and share their skills and knowledge across the country.</p>
<p>“Environment Canterbury will be able to use this funding to help identify and understand risks we face in Canterbury and how to respond to and recover from emergencies.</p>
<p>“I’m thrilled to celebrate the work being done in our region to keep New Zealanders safe and look forward to seeing the progress made as a result of this funding,” says Mr Korako.</p>
<p>Eight groups across New Zealand received a share of the $889,000 fund, which is distributed annually by The Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management.</p>
<p>Today’s announcement follows last month’s $6.2 million Budget boost for the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management.</p>
