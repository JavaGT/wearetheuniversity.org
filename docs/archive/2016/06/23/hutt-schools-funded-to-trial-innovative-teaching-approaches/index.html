<p><strong>Hutt schools funded to trial innovative teaching approaches to technology</strong></p>
<p>Chris Bishop, National List MP based in the Hutt Valley, says he can’t wait to see the results of a Hutt Valley schools’ project in 2 years’ time which has been given $300,000 as part of a fund to encourage innovative teaching practices.</p>
<p>“I’m happy to see our local education providers working together to raise achievement for children here in the Hutt Valley,” Mr Bishop says.</p>
<p>“This project involves eight schools including St Patrick’s College (Silverstream), St Bernard’s College and Sacred Heart College here in the Hutt. It aims to enhance student outcomes in technology in a number of Catholic secondary schools.</p>
<p>“This funding follows the success of two Hutt Valley projects in round one led by Maungaraki School, a collaborative project investigating teaching practices encouraging student agency, and Sacred Heart Petone who are leading a two year collaborative project to identify ‘best practice’ for learners transitioning to school.</p>
<p>“I am especially excited about the focus on enhancing student outcomes in technology. This feeds well into our drive to make the Hutt Valley ‘Technology Valley’ by preparing our kids for a hi-tech future.</p>
<p>“The project is the largest one of 46 selected in this second round of the Teacher-led Innovation Fund. This fund supports teachers’ bright ideas that evidence shows are working and can be shared across schools.</p>

<p>“It is part of National’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative which aims to encourage collaboration between schools to lift teaching practices to help Kiwi students achieve.”</p>
<p>This round of the fund involves 114 schools and six early childhood education providers. It is committing about $3.6 million of the $18 million fund. The next funding round will open in November.</p>
<p>“These projects will trial new ways of doing things, all with the aim to increase achievement for young New Zealanders,” Mr Bishop says.</p>
<p>“Where these projects are successful, other schools will be able to learn from the successes as well so that excellent practice becomes common practice.”</p>
