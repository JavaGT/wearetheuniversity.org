<p><strong>Green MP Marama Davidson to sleep in her car tonight</strong></p>
<p>Green MP Marama Davidson will be sleeping in her car tonight to show solidarity with homeless New Zealanders, and to send a message to the Government that more needs to be done to address the growing housing crisis.</p>
<p>Ms Davidson will be joining hundreds of other Aucklanders who are sleeping in their cars as part of the Lifewise Park Up For Homes Māngere event, to demand Government action on homelessness.</p>
<p>“Sleeping in a car, for one night, is a small thing I can do to show homeless New Zealanders I care, and that, as an MP, I’m going to do everything in my power to speak out and speak up for them,” said Ms Davidson.</p>
<p>“Every night, thousands of New Zealanders have to sleep in cars, garages and on the streets, because they’ve got nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have to be this way. Homelessness has jumped by 25% under National and it’s going to get worse unless the Government takes real action to address all the causes of the housing crisis.</p>
<p>“Growing homelessness is a big problem in my community, south Auckland, and what these people need is for the Government to actually acknowledge there’s a housing crisis, and for National to build more state and affordable homes.</p>
<p>“Instead, all we get from the Government is denials, excuses, and distractions, which is what happened this week with the Paula Bennett incident.</p>
<p>“The housing crisis is impacting people from all walks of life, but it’s obvious that those with the least are affected by it the most.</p>

<p>“The Government seems happy to stand by and watch as house prices and rents climb, the waiting list for Housing New Zealand gets longer, and more and more people are forced to sleep rough.</p>
<p>“That’s not the kind of New Zealand I want to raise my family in, and I know that many, many other Kiwis feel the same way,” said Ms Davidson.</p>
