<p><strong>Universities to host new Centres of Asia-Pacific Excellence</strong></p>
<p>Universities New Zealand has welcomed the Tertiary Minister’s announcement that up to three Centres of Asia-Pacific Excellence (CAPEs) will be developed within New Zealand’s universities.</p>
<p>Minister Steve Joyce today announced funding of $34.5million over 4 years as part of Budget 2016.</p>
<p>Professor Harlene Hayne, Chair of Universities New Zealand and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Otago, congratulated Minister Steven Joyce on the initiative.</p>
<p>“Universities are delighted to contribute their research, knowledge and expertise to support New Zealand’s economic and cultural ambitions in the strategically significant Asian-Pacific and Latin American regions. This will also draw on our already strong relationships with other universities and research institutes in these regions.</p>
<p>“We have the expertise to teach and advise on the regions’ respective languages, cultures and economies to students, exporters, and government agencies, to support their important work.</p>
<p>“Universities have long recognised the critical importance of developing cultural capability to ensure faculty and students have the skills, experience and ability to work across other cultures and borders.</p>
<p>“My fellow Vice-Chancellors and I look forward to working with the Tertiary Education Commission on this important initiative.”</p>
