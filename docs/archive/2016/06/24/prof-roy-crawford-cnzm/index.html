<p><strong>Friday, 24 June 2016, 11:10 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Universities_New_Zealand_-_Te_Pokai_Tara">Universities New Zealand - Te Pokai Tara</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Prof Roy Crawford CNZM</strong></p>
<p>University Vice-Chancellors express their sincere sympathy at the passing and loss of Professor Roy Crawford CNZM.</p>
<p>The current Chair of Universities New Zealand, and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Otago, Professor Harlene Hayne says, “Professor Roy Crawford leaves a significant and enduring professional legacy as a researcher, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Waikato (2005-2014), and past Chair of Universities New Zealand (2013-2014).”</p>
<p>“Under Roy’s leadership, the University of Waikato became a high performing university nationally and internationally. He forged strong links with stakeholders, communities and Māori across the region, as well as globally. His focus on research and innovation, and the establishment of research centres, made a significant and enduring contribution to New Zealand.”</p>
<p>“Through his work as Chair of Universities New Zealand, he repositioned our peak body to become a strategic think- tank, able to inform and influence decision-making.”</p>
<p>“We were therefore delighted that his legacy was recognised when he was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to tertiary education in the 2015 Queen’s Birthday Honours.”</p>
<p>Our thoughts are with his wife Renee, children Paul, Steven and Emma, and their families.</p>
