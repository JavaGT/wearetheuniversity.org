<p>Acting Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>MEDIA STATEMENT  </p>
<p>10 June 2016</p>
<p>Blaming Maori and Pasifika education for lack of housing is a disgrace</p>
<p>Nick Smith sunk to a new low when he blamed Maori and Pasifika educational underachievement for plummeting rates of homeownership among their people, Labour’s Acting Education spokesperson Jenny Salesa says.</p>
<p>“The Housing Minister <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/80898652/government-criticised-over-plummeting-maori-and-pacific-island-home-ownership-rates">yesterday said</a> lower rates of home ownership among Maori and Pasifika were ‘just a broader reflection of the fact that they tend to have lower education achievement, that they have lower incomes, and that translates itself into housing’.</p>
<p>“His comments totally ignore the fact that National has allowed the housing crisis to spiral out of control. With Auckland house prices rising by an exorbitant $460,000 since National came to office, it’s no wonder an entire generation is being locked out of the Kiwi dream of home ownership.</p>
<p>“Nick Smith’s comments also ignore the facts on Maori and Pasifika educational outcomes in the past 25 years. Maybe he should ask the Education Minister for a lesson.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/tertiary-education/retention_and_achievement">Since 1991</a> the number of Maori with no qualifications has fallen from 58 to 33 per cent. Those with a diploma/trade certificate qualification as their highest qualification increased from 21 to 28 per cent and those with a degree as their highest qualification increased from 1 to 10 per cent.</p>

<p>“Over the same period the number of Pasikifa people with no qualification fell from 56 to 34 per cent. Those with a diploma/trade certificate qualification as their highest qualification increased from 15 to 21 per cent and those with a degree as their highest qualification increased from 1 to 8 per cent.</p>
<p>“Yet despite these improvements in educational outcomes, since 1986 Maori homeownership has plummeted by 20 per cent and Pasifika homeownership by almost 35 per cent.</p>
<p>“Instead of dog whistling to prejudice, Nick Smith should embark on a massive state-backed affordable house building programme and crack down on offshore speculators driving up house prices,” Jenny Salesa says.</p>
