<p>All New Zealanders Should Be Able to See All Blacks Free on TV</p>
<p>The government needs to step in and ensure all Kiwis can view the All Blacks on free-to-view television, especially when they are playing in New Zealand, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“Rugby remains New Zealand’s national game but it has become increasingly a game in which major matches can only be watched live by the better-off members of our society,” says New Zealand First’s Spokesperson for Sport and Recreation Clayton Mitchell.</p>
<p>“There will be many people who cannot to afford to buy tickets to attend Saturday night’s test at Eden Park between the All Blacks and Wales.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of thousands of others will miss out on watching the game live on television because they can’t afford to pay a monthly fee to Sky.</p>
<p>“The All Blacks are our showpiece team and the public should be able to view them for free on television, as they once could.</p>
<p>“Critics say if free-to-view is introduced the All Blacks themselves will suffer because they will miss out on money coming to them via broadcasting rights.</p>
<p>“This is where the government must step in and do as governments in Britain and Australia have done and ensure certain sports have free, live broadcasts.</p>
<p>“After all, it is taxpayers’ money that is propping up TVNZ and Māori TV,” Mr Mitchell says.</p>
