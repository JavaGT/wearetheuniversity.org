<p><strong>Funding body gives strong support to Otago’s health research</strong></p>
<p>University of Otago researchers have been awarded around $43.8M in new health research funding to support their world-class studies aimed at improving New Zealanders’ health and well-being.</p>
<p>In the latest Health Research Council (HRC) of New Zealand (note 6am tomorrow embargo), more than $100 million grants has been allocated nationally towards a range of programmes and projects to be undertaken by researchers throughout New Zealand.</p>
<p>Otago researchers gained 22 contracts, including five major multi-million-dollar, five-year programmes and 17 projects, each of which attracts more than one million dollars in funding.</p>
<p>Otago’s recipients are from across the University’s campuses in Dunedin, Christchurch and Wellington and each campus hosts at least one of the major new programmes to receive funding.</p>
<p>Success in funding round reflects excellence of Otago researchers</p>
<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Research and Enterprise, Professor Richard Blaikie, warmly congratulated all Otago’s HRC funding recipients, saying their outstanding success in the round is testament to their world-class research proposals.</p>
<p>“It is fantastic to see the recent commitment of increased HRC funding translate immediately into such a significant increase in the number of projects supported. It is heartening that the great promise of our researchers’ studies for improving the health and well-being of New Zealanders has been recognised and backed by the HRC and the Government. These staff are carrying on a proud Otago research tradition of contributing to knowledge and actions that will benefit patients, families, communities and the nation as a whole, and we wish them every success in their work,” Professor Blaikie says.</p>
