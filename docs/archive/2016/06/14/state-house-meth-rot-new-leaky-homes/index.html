<p>State House ‘Meth Rot’ New ‘Leaky Homes’</p>
<p>Lack of action from the government to address the epidemic of meth contamination in our state houses has turned it into the new “leaky homes” crisis, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“More than a thousand state houses will show up as contaminated this year, according to social housing officials,” says New Zealand First Social Development Spokesperson Darroch Ball.</p>
<p>“Minster for Social Housing Paula Bennett intends to address the meth users and cooks by, ‘giving them the hard word’.</p>
<p>“This is a failure to acknowledge the level of ‘meth rot’ in state houses.</p>
<p>“Three months ago Deputy Prime Minister Bill English accepted that they needed ‘firmer measures’ but the number of contaminated state houses continues to sky rocket.</p>
<p>“From 28 houses found to be contaminated in 2014, it was 280 in 2015, and now over 1000 this year.</p>
<p>“With hundreds of honest families desperate for a state house, this level of blind apathy is outrageously irresponsible.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First calls on the government to get tough on meth using tenants.</p>
<p>“If they are caught contaminating their state house they should be kicked out for life, remain on a public register for seven years that will alert landlords, and be made to pay back the cost of repairing the damage.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First wants action now.</p>
<p>“This crisis is now affecting landlords and private property owners.</p>
<p>“The ‘leaky homes’ disaster will soon be joined by the ‘meth rot’ crisis,” says Mr Ball.</p>
