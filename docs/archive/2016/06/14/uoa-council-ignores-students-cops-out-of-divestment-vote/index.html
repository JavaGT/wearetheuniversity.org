<p><strong>UOA Council ignores students, cops out of divestment vote</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon the University of Auckland Council declined to vote on a motion that would encourage the university&#39;s foundation to divest from fossil fuels, to the disappointment of Auckland University Students Association and student group Fossil Free UoA.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, more than fifty people had rallied outside the university calling on the Council to vote on the motion for supporting fossil fuel divestment. If passed, it would have given a strong indication to the University of Auckland Foundation that manages the University&#39;s money to stop funding climate change by disinvesting from the fossil fuel industry.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an extremely disappointing move from the University Council, in shirking their governance responsibilities to be direction setters for the University,&quot; said Fossil Free UoA spokesperson Alex Johnston.</p>
<p>&quot;By not even voting on whether to urge the Foundation to divest, the University Council has said it is ok for the Foundation to keep fuelling climate change through its investments.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The University of Auckland will continue to lag behind on ethical investment, in being the only major University in New Zealand with no serious restrictions on where it invests.&quot;</p>
<p>The motion to support fossil fuel divestment which had the support of more than ten students associations was brought forward by the student representative on the Council, AUSA President Will Matthews. Although having some support around the Council table, no vote was taken by the University Chancellor, instead resolving to pass on the students&#39; concerns to the Foundation chair.</p>

<p>In the meeting, Matthews had said: &quot;Fossil fuel divestment is in line with the University of Auckland Strategic plan, which says that we cannot plunder the future in order to pay for the present.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is also in line with the trends shown by many competitor Universities in the Group of Eight and Russell Group Universities.&quot;</p>
<p>Both AUSA and Fossil Free UoA said they will continue to push for the University to divest from fossil fuels and establish an ethical investment policy.</p>
<p>Said Johnston: &quot;The number of people at today&#39;s rally as well as the support from student associations, staff and alumni shows that the momentum is behind the divestment movement and eventually the University administration and the Foundation will be forced to listen.&quot;</p>
