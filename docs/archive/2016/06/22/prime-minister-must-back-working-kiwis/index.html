<p>Prime Minister must back working Kiwis</p>
<p>The Prime Minister needs to reassess his priorities and move urgently to stop working Kiwis losing up to a million dollars a day says CTU Secretary Sam Huggard.</p>
<p>The call follows the CTU&#39;s request that the government urgently pass legislation to stop the clock on the six year limit that is writing off holiday back pay owed to working Kiwis.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ve written a law that would do this, but last night John Key said legislating to stop Kiwis losing this money would take too long.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;However less than a year ago the Government passed legislation to validate speeding tickets in just two hours, when hundreds of thousands of Kiwis are losing up to a million dollars a day, we&#39;d have expected the same urgency.”</p>
<p>&quot;This is an issue which can be fixed, but the size of the problem means it will take time. It&#39;s important that New Zealanders don&#39;t lose any more back pay while we work with Government and business to make things right.”</p>
<p>&quot;This is a big issue for New Zealanders, in just the last 13 hours we&#39;ve had over 1,700 people sign an open letter asking the Prime Minister to stop the clock and save Kiwis millions.”</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re confident the Government would have the support to pass our law if they choose to take it to the house next week,&quot; Huggard said.</p>
