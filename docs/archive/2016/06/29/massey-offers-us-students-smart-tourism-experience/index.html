<p><strong>Massey offers US students smart tourism experience</strong></p>
<p>Nine American university students are making the most of their summer break with a unique tour of New Zealand that combines tourism with business field trips and a work experience placement.</p>
<p>The students are participating in Massey University’s international internship paper, the only one of its kind offered in New Zealand and a first for those studying communication and marketing. According to Professor Frank Sligo from Massey’s School of Communication, Journalism and Markerting, it’s an example of “smart tourism”.</p>
<p>The six-week programme offers not only an internship with a leading New Zealand organisation, but also a two-week expedition from Auckland to Queenstown. In the process the students complete two 15-credit Massey papers that can be credited towards their degrees back in the United States.</p>
<p>“This study tour takes in the country’s best tourism attractions while giving the students valuable insights into how New Zealand markets itself through a series of field trips,” Professor Sligo says. “This is smart tourism – it brings focused, high achievers to New Zealand where they contribute to our tourism industry while also paying full international study fees.”</p>
<p>Having completed the national expedition, the students are now beginning their internships in Wellington. Host organisations include New Zealand Police, Enspiral Collective and Volunteering NZ.</p>
<p>Amanda White, who has been placed with Enspiral Collective, says she is looking forward to her internship.</p>

<p>“I am very excited to intern at Enspiral, an organisation that is focused on connection and social impact,” says the Miami University student. “The internship will be an opportunity to both observe and truly feel a part of Kiwi culture in the workplace. I’m also, of course, looking forward to gaining professional experience.”</p>
<p>Ms White says the structure of Massey’s programme offers a unique “best of both worlds” experience.</p>
<p>“I wanted a vibrant internship experience and time abroad, which Massey provides through this programme. I’ve also been interested in working in the tourism industry for years, and the expedition has been a hands-on opportunity to feed my curiosity about the field.”</p>
<p>Fellow tour member Kelsi Cypser, from Iowa State University, says the programme was a perfect fit for her.</p>
<p>“It had always been a dream of mine to visit New Zealand,” she says. “I had decided I wanted to study abroad for the summer and this specific programme offered a study abroad course <em>and</em> a marketing internship. It was the perfect opportunity for me with everything I wanted.”</p>
<p>Both say getting a behind-the-scenes look at New Zealand’s tourism industry has been invaluable and the tour has created life-long memories. While Ms Cypser says going skydiving was “the most amazing thing I have ever done”, Ms White says the sector has taught her the importance of understanding your values.</p>
<p>“That means knowing your story and exactly what kind of unique experience you provide to guests, which will make them both add to your story and take away their own one-of-a-kind adventure with your organisation,” she says.</p>
<p>Professor Sligo says he is confident that Massey will send the students back to the United States with skills that will make them more sought-after employees.</p>
<p>“The programme offers international students the chance to to apply their skills and knowledge in a new context. They get the opportunity to adapt their learning within a new culture and expand their operational comfort zone.”</p>
<p>Wellington host companies benefit as well, he says, with the students bringing a new, international perspective into their businesses.</p>
<p>The communication and marketing programme follows a successful pilot focused on agriculture students in 2014. In 2015, this programme grew from seven participants to 36 and further growth is expected for 2016.</p>
<p>This year the university will offer three national expedition and internship programmes for agriculture, communication and emergency management students. Other study areas will be offered in future years, including creative expression and media studies and education and community outreach.</p>
<p>Professor Sligo says the School of Communication, Journalism and Marketing focused on the United States for its first programme because American students form a major segment of the study abroad market. The school also has full accreditation from the US-based Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (ACEJMC), which is highly regarded by American students.</p>
