<p>State school failure shows value of Partnership Schools</p>
<p>Press release: ACT New Zealand<br>June 29, 2016. 11:20am</p>
<p>Failing state schools are avoiding closure, which shows the value of the Partnership Schools model, says ACT Leader David Seymour. A New Zealand Initiative report shows some state schools poorly perform for at least a decade.</p>
<p>“It’s an open secret that certain state schools just aren’t up to scratch, even after years of negative reviews and interventions,” said Mr Seymour.</p>
<p>“A failing business wouldn’t be kept on life support by the government. It would close and a better one would take its place. Education is more important than any business. Partnership Schools face closure if they don’t deliver results.</p>
<p>“Partnership Schools, unlike state schools, are directly accountable to the crown for contracted outcomes, and must be able to attract and retain students.</p>
<p>“Blaming inequality for failure doesn’t stack up when some state school students are simply not making progress at all. It’s our schools’ job to lift achievement for these kids, even if this means some schools have to break from the one-size-fits-all model.”</p>
