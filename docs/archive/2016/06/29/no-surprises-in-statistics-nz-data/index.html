<p>No Surprises in Statistics NZ Data</p>
<p>The Household Net Worth Statistics released yesterday by Statistics New Zealand are no surprise to the New Zealand Union of Students Associations.</p>
<p>President Linsey Higgins says this data is aligned with the information that the organisation already had, and has got worse since due to further limitations on allowances and their replacement with loans.</p>
<p>“We know from our own research that a large number of students are graduating with large loans and this is stopping them from getting started in life”.</p>
<p>NZUSA believes that crippling young people with growing levels of educational debt is a sure fire way to cost the government more in the long run.</p>
<p>“We know that 70% of students think their debt will affect their ability to buy a house and 36% think it will affect their decision to have children. Students believe their debt will impact on their ability to save for retirement with only 5% not seeing this as an issue.”</p>
<p>A high level of debt to asset ratio makes it hard to get started, especially when graduate wages remain low and housing prices spiral out of control.</p>
<p>“If this government cares about supporting all people to retire well, then it needs to take a long hard look at free tertiary education. We know free tertiary education has set up older generations with a prosperous work life and a good retirement. It’s inter-generational theft if we deny today’s students the same”.</p>
