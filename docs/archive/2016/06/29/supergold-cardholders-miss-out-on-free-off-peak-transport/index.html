<p>Supergold Cardholders Will Miss Out on Free Off-Peak Transport</p>
<p>Thousands of SuperGold Card users will be shut out of free off-peak public transport in Auckland with the switch to the Auckland Transport Gold HOP card, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“The confused, long-winded changeover is excluding thousands – this is just what the government wants,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“The fewer people using their SuperGold Card concession, the less it costs the government.</p>
<p>“The change to the HOP card by July 1 has been a mess from the start, and is sidelining tens of thousands of people who have been confused by the lack of information and the many changes in the process.</p>
<p>“The requirement for photo ID was eventually dumped. Thousands were signed on to a new blue HOP card, then it was dropped for a gold-coloured card. Little direct information went to cardholders and Auckland Transport is now chasing Seniors all over the city with a mobile unit.</p>
<p>“Instead of one SuperGold Card to get on a bus, train or ferry there will be Seniors lining up with SuperGold Cards, blue HOP cards and gold HOP cards. What a muddle.</p>
<p>“Even if they use public transport only twice a year SuperGold Cardholders are entitled to free off-peak transport, but right now many will miss out,” says Mr Peters.</p>
