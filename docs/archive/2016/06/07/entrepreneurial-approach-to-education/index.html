<p><strong>Tuesday, 7 June 2016, 1:18 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato">University of Waikato</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Entrepreneurial approach to education proves highly sustainable</strong></p>
<p>Bay of Plenty man Kevin Powell is not your average teaching graduate. While he had every intention of becoming a ‘traditional’ classroom based teacher following completion of his degree, instead he’s taken an entrepreneurial approach to education, establishing the business Teacher in the Paddock – a ‘living outdoor classroom’.</p>
<p>Kevin sums up Teacher in the Paddock as a hands on opportunity for adults and children to experience the simplicity of good nutrition and a sustainable lifestyle.</p>
<p>“It helps connect children and adults with their food, where it comes from and how it impacts our health and well-being, as well as many other aspects of renewable living principles. We offer a series of programmes which provide teachers, parents and children a living resource that is cross-curricular. We base these programmes both outdoors on our small lifestyle block and in our house, making this a unique ‘homely’ experience for all.”</p>
<p>As part of studying his teaching degree at the University of Waikato in Tauranga, Kevin says students were exposed to a range of opportunities which demonstrated the diversity of a teaching qualification. This influenced the realisation he could pursue any number of careers.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Ministry of Education reported that only 15 per cent of new graduates were picking up permanent jobs in schools. Kevin is bucking this alleged trend by taking an innovative approach to education.</p>

<p>“During our studies we were told that employment options could be challenging due to the high volumes of job seekers versus positions available. Things weren’t painted negatively, but in a realistic sense. As with anything though, I’d say that attitude is 99%.”</p>
<p>Attitude clearly is everything – across the University of Waikato’s undergraduate teaching programmes, more than 80% of 2016 teaching graduates from Tauranga already have jobs (comprised of both full and part time education related roles).</p>
<p>“Prior to setting up Teacher in a Paddock it dawned on me I had a range of abilities that - coupled with learning to be a teacher - allowed me choices I had never even considered. My advice to others considering the teaching profession is to consider your studies as an opening of doors to a world of possibility.”</p>
<p>He believes that education encourages us to question not only how we see our world, but how to make a positive contribution. And through Teacher in the Paddock, Kevin is definitely making his.</p>
<p>“Visitors can expect to see a slice of paradise and a way of living that, although somewhat reminiscent of ‘old times’, reflects a growing trend and more sustainable way of being in our age of pre-prepared, pre-packed consumption driven society. It showcases our lifestyle, based around self-determination, self-sufficiency and sustainability through the mediums of see, hear, smell, touch, taste and smell.”</p>
<p>Teacher in the Paddock offers a range of programmes aimed at 2 – 70 years, including after school care, school holiday programmes and community focused nutritional workshops and sustainable backyard events.</p>
<p><strong>* <em>Kevin will be speaking about his career path at the University of Waikato’s Tauranga Education Careers Expo on Friday, 10 June. The event is targeted at local secondary students interested in careers in education, as well as any members of the public considering a career change.
