<p><strong>Put Meth ‘Cooks’ on Bad Tenant Register to Warn Landlords</strong></p>
<p>The government is failing to step up and address the effects of methamphetamine use and manufacture on New Zealand private rental properties, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“Tens-of-thousands of dollars are being forked out by landlords monthly having to clean up meth-contaminated properties because of the criminal behaviour of tenants, and something needs to be done urgently,” says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Social Housing Darroch Ball.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First wants all tenants found to have contaminated properties to remain on a public register for seven years so any future landlords will know who these people are and what they do to other people’s property.</p>
<p>“It would be up to future landlords at that stage to decide if they wish to offer them any tenancy.</p>
<p>“We must stop tenants who have caused methamphetamine damage moving freely from property to property causing thousands of dollars of damage along the way.</p>
<p>“At the moment there are no barriers to stop the ongoing impact of their actions.</p>
<p>“We must put a stop to the epidemic of meth damage to rental accommodation across the country.</p>
<p>“If we don’t take immediate action we will be faced with nothing short of another ‘leaky home’ crisis,” says Mr Ball.</p>
