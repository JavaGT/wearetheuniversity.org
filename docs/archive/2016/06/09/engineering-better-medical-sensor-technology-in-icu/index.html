<p><strong>Engineering better medical sensor technology in ICU</strong></p>
<p>Engineers at the University of Canterbury are working with St George’s Hospital and the Canterbury District Health Board to speed up sepsis detection in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).</p>
<p>By modifying existing technology and using it in a new way, University of Canterbury (UC) bioengineers have been able to pick up an additional oxygen saturation reading that could provide an early indication of sepsis.</p>
<p>Mechanical Engineer Dr Chris Pretty, from UC’s College of Engineering, says existing non-invasive sensor technology has been repurposed to pick up the venous oxygen saturation signal, normally obtained via invasive blood sampling.</p>
<p>“This real-time measurement could solve a problem for clinicians, enabling them to identify and treat conditions, such as sepsis, earlier.”</p>
<p>Sepsis results in poor oxygen extraction from the blood. Standard pulse oximeters, which attach to a patient’s finger, only offer arterial oxygen saturation readings. By attaching a low pressure cuff around the top of a patient’s finger and employing sophisticated signal processing and control, Dr Pretty and co-researchers can also obtain venous oxygen saturation readings.</p>
<p>“Knowing both the arterial and venous saturations, and how they change, will enable earlier diagnosis and lead to better patient outcomes,” Dr Pretty says.</p>
<p>He and his UC colleagues have a longstanding relationship with Dr Geoff Shaw from the Canterbury District Health Board. This has led to an increasing amount of work at St George’s Hospital, which has a strong interest in advancing ICU research.</p>
<p>Dr Pretty says that having access to hospital facilities enables researchers to solve problems more quickly, assisting developments to make a difference in the ICU sooner.</p>
<p>“It is a rare and valuable opportunity to conduct applied research in a real clinical setting. St George’s has provided significant research support to see this project to this point. This has been critical and highly welcomed.”</p>
<p>The project is progressing well and the next stage will involve trialling the device on real patients at both Christchurch and St George’s Hospitals.</p>
<p>The relationship with Christchurch and St George’s Hospitals has also inspired other joint applied-research projects to improve outcomes for patients, says Dr Pretty.</p>
