<p>Overweight mothers were nearly three times more likely than normal-weight mothers to have a daughter who would become obese as an adult, a large study has found.</p>
<p>And obese mothers were nearly five times more likely to have a daughter who would grow up to become obese.</p>
<p>Researchers examined early pregnancy data on 26,561 Swedish mother-and-daughter pairs. Another finding emerged that starkly highlights the rising worldwide obesity epidemic: obesity rates jumped four-fold between the two generations of women, from 3.1 per cent among the mothers entering pregnancy in 1982-1988, to 12.3 per cent among their daughters in 2000-2008.</p>
<p>&quot;These findings add to the international evidence for a worsening intergenerational cycle of obesity,&quot; says one of the researchers, Dr José Derraik from the Liggins Institute.</p>
<p>The study is part of a series by collaborators from the Liggins Institute, based at the University of Auckland, and Uppsala University in Sweden. The team has analysed a rich body of data on Swedish women to better understand the long-term effects of early life events and conditions occurring before, during, and after pregnancy.</p>
<p>Obesity is a serious health issue for both mothers and their children. Almost one in three New Zealand adults are obese.</p>
<p>&quot;Being obese increases a pregnant woman’s risk of developing pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, miscarriage and infant mortality,&quot; explains Dr Derraik.</p>
<p>&quot;Also, there is mounting evidence that obesity during pregnancy may affect children’s health not only in childhood, but also in adult life.&quot;</p>
<p>Other researchers have proposed an &quot;intergenerational obesity cycle&quot;, where obese mothers provide too much nutrition to their babies during gestation, and the babies become adapted to store more fat in childhood and adulthood.</p>
<p>This striking rise in obesity rates could also be partly explained by the so-called &quot;obesogenic environment&quot;, where the family diet and lifestyle could be fostering the development of obesity among daughters.</p>
<p>&quot;This study underlines how vital it is to try to break the obesity cycle by doing what we can to prevent obesity early in life,&quot; says Dr Derraik. &quot;Unfortunately, this is not easy. Obesity is a serious public health issue that requires solutions at every level of society.&quot;</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal <em>Scientific Reports.</em></p>
<h3>Key points</h3>
<ul>
<li>Study of 26,561 Swedish mother-daughter pairs showed that obesity rates early in pregnancy rose four-fold from 3.1% among mothers to 12.3% among  their daughters.</li>
<li>Overweight mothers were nearly 3 times more likely to have an obese adult daughter.</li>
<li>Obese mothers were nearly 5 times more likely to have an obese adult daughter.</li>
<li>This study is by researchers at the Liggins Institute at University of Auckland and Sweden’s Uppsala University.</li>
<li>Previous studies have proposed an &quot;intergenerational obesity cycle&quot;, where obese mothers provide too much nutrition to their babies during gestation, and the babies become adapted to store more fat.</li>
<li>&quot;Obesogenic&quot; family lifestyle may further fuel obesity in daughters.</li>
