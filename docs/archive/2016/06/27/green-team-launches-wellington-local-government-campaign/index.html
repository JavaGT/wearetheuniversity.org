<p>Green team launches Wellington region local government campaign</p>
<p>The Green Party launched a campaign this weekend to win more seats on the Wellington region’s councils and district health boards, including the Hutt City Council for the first time, along with a strong suite of policies.</p>
<p>“We’re looking forward to building on the successes of the last council elections, when we got all of our Wellington local government candidates elected, to get more Green candidates elected in the Wellington region,” said Green Party Co-leader James Shaw.</p>
<p>Wellington Green local government candidates commit to working for:</p>
<p>1. Affordable, reliable, and low-pollution public transport with 25 percent discounts for off-peak fares, 50 percent discounts for tertiary students, and special weekend family fares.<br>2. A warrant of fitness scheme for rental homes. Current laws would require this to be voluntary at first, but councillors would continue to lobby central government to allow a mandatory scheme.<br>3. Championing the Living Wage for all employees and contractors at Wellington and Hutt City Councils and Wellington, Hutt, and Kenepuru Hospitals.</p>
<p>“Better and more affordable public transport is at the heart of what Green councillors will work to deliver for Wellington, including clean all-electric buses and light rail from the CBD to the airport,” said Wellington Regional Council candidate Sue Kedgley.</p>
<p>“The Hutt Valley has a stunning environment that needs protecting. We also deserve a high quality healthcare system where staff and patients are valued,” said Hutt City Council (Eastern Ward) and Hutt Valley District Health Board candidate Lisa Bridson.</p>

<p>“Wellington can become a low carbon and climate change-resilient city, by investing in clean transport and the infrastructure we need to deal with climate change,” Wellington Regional Council candidate Paul Bruce said.</p>
<p>“All Wellingtonians deserve quality living in affordable, warm, dry homes and that&#39;s what more Green councillors will help to deliver,” said Wellington City Council (Lambton Ward) candidate Iona Pannett.</p>
<p>“Green Councillors will continue to strongly question why ratepayers should pay for an airport runway extension which will cause traffic delays while it is being built, have a large impact on the environment, and may not even be used. Our beautiful south coast is too important, and we haven’t yet seen a clear business case,” said Wellington City Council (Eastern Ward) candidate Sarah Free.</p>
<p>“With more Green councillors, Wellington can become the number one city in New Zealand for smart, innovative jobs especially in ICT and the creative sectors,” said Wellington City Council (Southern Ward) candidate David Lee.</p>
<p>“As our population grows, we need a sensible approach to delivering primary healthcare that focuses on prevention, and as a nurse and midwife I will help deliver that,” Capital &amp; Coast District Health Board candidate Sue Teng said.</p>
