<p>22 April 2016</p>
<p><strong>Big jump in benefit numbers in Christchurch as rebuild slows</strong></p>
<p>The Christchurch rebuild seems to be stalling with a 20% increase in people on the jobseeker benefit since March last year, says Labour’s Canterbury spokesperson Megan Woods.</p>
<p>“Major rebuild projects are years behind schedule and that’s having an impact on job creation. It’s very disturbing to see such a steep climb in people on benefits in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>“Why is it that in a city where so much money is being spent, there are so many people who can’t find work? This raises real concerns about the skills training that has been available to locals. We need to be provide opportunities for people to learn new skills so they can find work.</p>
<p>“I’ll be working closely with our social welfare spokesperson Carmel Sepuloni to drill down into what exactly is driving these rises in numbers, and what support local people need.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, the Government continues to arrogantly claim everything is fine but these numbers should be a warning sign. The delayed rebuild is leading to more people out of work.</p>
<p>“In March 2015, there were 5,728 people on a jobseeker benefit in Christchurch. In March this year, that number was 6,899. That’s over 1000 more people out of work.</p>
<p>“Rebuilding from the earthquakes was always going to deliver a short term boost in spending, but it isn’t a long term plan to help people find work.” says Megan Woods.</p>
