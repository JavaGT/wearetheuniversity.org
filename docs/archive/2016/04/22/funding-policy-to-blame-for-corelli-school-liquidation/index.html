<p>Funding policy to blame for Corelli school liquidation</p>
<p>Press release: ACT New Zealand<br>April 22, 2016. 10:45am</p>
<p>ACT Leader David Seymour has criticised the unfair playing field for private schools in response to the liquidation of Corelli International Academic School of the Arts.</p>
<p>“It’s deeply disappointing to see such a respected private school threatened with closure due to financial obstacles,” says Mr Seymour.</p>
<p>“These schools compete with state schools, but at huge disadvantage. Private school funding was capped 15 years ago, the same year Corelli was founded, while state school funding has increased year-on-year.</p>
<p>“The sad irony is that Labour’s funding freeze for these schools, continued by National, actually costs the taxpayer. The average private school student receives $5000 less funding per year than a state school student. So if the school’s financial obstacles force its 37 students into state education, the taxpayer could be $185,000 poorer each year.</p>
<p>“We need to level the playing ground between different types of schools. Private school parents pay taxes on top their fees, so it’s unfair that their kids receive so much less funding than others.</p>
<p>“With a funding policy like this, it’s no wonder that modest private schools are facing closure. Fairer funding would both provide more choice and save taxpayer money.”</p>
