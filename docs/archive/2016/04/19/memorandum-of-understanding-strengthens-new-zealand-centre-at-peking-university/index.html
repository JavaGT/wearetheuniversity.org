<p>19 April 2016</p>
<p>Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and NZ Prime Minister Rt Hon John Key today witnessed the signing of an agreement to strengthen the NZ Centre at Peking University (PKU).</p>
<p>The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) reflects the importance of the NZ Centre to New Zealand and its Chinese university partner.</p>
<p>Peking University President Lin Jianhua, Victoria University of Wellington Vice-Chancellor Professor Grant Guilford, and University of Auckland Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Strategic Engagement) Professor Jenny Dixon signed the MOU at the Great Hall of the People. The Memorandum will ultimately be signed by all eight NZ universities.</p>
<p>&quot;The NZ Centre is a unique partnership between one of China&#39;s most prestigious universities and New Zealand’s academics and researchers. It promotes the study of NZ in China and contributes to the strengthening of the deep relationship between China and NZ.&quot;</p>
<p>The Centre offers an undergraduate elective course on New Zealand which is taught in English, facilitates exchanges of researchers between PKU and New Zealand universities, and provides a forum for policy dialogue. An annual summer school is held in New Zealand for PKU students.</p>
<p>The Centre was initially established by the University of Auckland in 2007 and joined soon by four other NZ universities: the University of Otago, Victoria University of Wellington, University of Waikato and the University of Canterbury. Massey University, AUT and Lincoln University joined later.</p>
<p>The Centre is also supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and Education NZ.</p>
