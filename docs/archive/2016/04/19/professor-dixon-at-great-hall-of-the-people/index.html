<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Strategic Engagement) Professor Jenny Dixon was a signatory to a Memorandum of Understanding witnessed by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and New Zealand Prime Minister Rt Hon John Key during a signing ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. (18 April)</p>
<p>Professor Dixon travelled to Beijing to join the 40 strong trade mission lead by Prime Minister Key.</p>
<p>The University Memorandum of Understanding strengthens the NZ Centre at Peking University relationships and reflects the importance of the Centre to New Zealand and its Chinese university partner.</p>
<p>Professor Dixon, Peking University President Lin Jianhua and Victoria University of Wellington Vice-Chancellor Professor Grant Guilford signed the MOU.</p>
<p>New Zealand Centre Advisory Board chair Professor Jenny Dixon says the signing is a significant milestone for the Centre.</p>
<p>&quot;The New Zealand Centre is a unique partnership between one of China’s most prestigious universities and New Zealand’s academics and researchers,&quot; she says. &quot;It promotes the study of New Zealand in China and contributes to the strengthening of the deep relationship between China and New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>The Centre offers an undergraduate elective course on New Zealand, which is taught in English, facilitates exchanges of researchers between PKU and New Zealand universities, and provides a forum for policy dialogue. An annual summer school is held in New Zealand for PKU students.</p>
<p>The Centre was initially established by the University of Auckland in 2007 and joined soon after by four other New Zealand universities: the University of Otago, Victoria University of Wellington, University of Waikato and the University of Canterbury. Massey University, AUT and Lincoln University joined later.</p>
<p>The Centre is also supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and Education NZ.</p>
