<p><strong>University of Otago appoints next Dean of Pharmacy</strong></p>
<p>A leading researcher from Canada has been appointed as the next Dean of the University of Otago’s School of Pharmacy.</p>
<p>Dr Carlo Marra is currently Dean and Professor at the School of Pharmacy at Memorial University of Newfoundland. He will take up his position at Otago at the beginning of August.</p>
<p>Announcing the appointment, Vice-Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne said that Professor Marra is an excellent choice to lead Otago’s School of Pharmacy.</p>
<p>“It is very pleasing that a researcher and teacher of Professor Marra’s calibre has been selected to lead the School of Pharmacy, which is a key element of the Health Sciences at Otago.”</p>
<p>Professor Marra has a strong academic background with over 200 publications in peer-reviewed journals, more than 200 presentations at scientific conferences, and a long history of graduate student supervision.</p>
<p>His research has mainly focused on health economics, quality of life research and pharmacoepidemiology, including evaluations in musculoskeletal and respiratory diseases. He is also very interested in evaluating the clinical benefits and economic attractiveness of advanced scope of practice for pharmacists.</p>
<p>He holds a Bachelor of Science (Pharmacy), a Doctor of Pharmacy, and a PhD in health care and epidemiology from the University of British Columbia, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Arthritis Research Centre of Canada in Arthritis Epidemiology and Pharmacoepidemiology.</p>

<p>Professor Marra has participated on grant panels for a number of national and international agencies, is an associate editor for the international journal_Arthritis Care and Research_ and is on the editorial board for the <em>Canadian Pharmacists Journal</em>.</p>
<p>Professor Marra says he is very excited to be joining the School of Pharmacy given its strong reputation for research excellence and a history of high quality graduates.</p>
<p>He says the profession of pharmacy is evolving rapidly throughout the world — pharmacists are taking on new responsibilities in primary care and institutional settings to improve patients’ health outcomes.</p>
<p>“As such, it is important that we keep pace through innovative research and educational programmes to equip the pharmacists of tomorrow to meet new challenges. An area that I particularly feel we need to investigate is the value for money proposition of expanded pharmacist services to guide their implementation in health care delivery.</p>
<p>“I am truly looking forward to engaging and working with my colleagues and students in the School of Pharmacy, the University of Otago and the broader pharmacy and health care community in New Zealand to realise our goals for the School and the profession of pharmacy.”</p>
<p>Health Sciences Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor Peter Crampton warmly welcomed Professor Marra’s appointment as Dean saying he very much looks forward to working with him to build on the strong contributions the School makes to the University and the profession.</p>
<p>Professor Crampton and the Vice-Chancellor both said that they wished to acknowledge and thank current Dean Professor Steve Duffull for leading the School since 2010. After taking research and study leave he will continue in his role as the School’s Professor of Clinical Pharmacy.</p>
