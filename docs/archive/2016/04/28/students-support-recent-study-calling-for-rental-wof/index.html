<p><strong>Students support recent study calling for Rental Warrant of Fitness</strong></p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) supports recent research that recommends strengthening the Residential Tenancies Act to include a rental Warrant of Fitness (WoF).</p>
<p>New research recently published in the online journal <em>People, Place and Policy</em> by Dr Kimberley O’Sullivan, Dr Barnard, Helen Viggers and Professor Philippa Howden-Chapman at He Kainga Oranga/Housing and Health Research</p>
<p>Programme explored the evidence that children and young people are at risk of cold housing and fuel poverty.</p>
<p>‘We support this recent study as evidence of the effects of poor, inadequate rental housing,’ says Jonathan Gee, VUWSA President.</p>
<p>‘We’ve known about the mouldy, lived conditions that many students are accustomed to living in unhealthy rentals where the demand for flats are high.</p>
<p>‘We’re glad to have further research back this up as we have campaigned for the introduction of a rental housing Warrant of Fitness as we know anecdotally that this will improve the health and wellbeing of students.</p>
<p>‘We will continue to campaign for the introduction of a rental-housing Warrant of Fitness to improve housing conditions for students.’</p>
