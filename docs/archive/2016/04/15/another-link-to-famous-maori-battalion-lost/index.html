<p>Another Link to Famous Maori Battalion Lost</p>
<p>Another link to the famous 28th Māori Battalion has been lost with the passing of Hinga Smith, New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament, Rt Hon Winston Peters says.</p>
<p>“With another Anzac Day almost upon us it is the time when we think of war and peace – it will be even more poignant this year with the loss of another Māori Battalion veteran,” Mr Peters says.</p>
<p>“Mr Smith was an example of how young men were prepared to do their duty for their country in World War II. He was raised at Hauiti Pa in Tolaga Bay and lied about his age to join up in 1942 aged only 16.</p>
<p>“He served bravely, but as he told a reporter several years ago, he hated war: ‘It achieves nothing,’ he said.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First expresses it deepest condolences to Mr Hinga Smith’s family and loved ones.</p>
<p>“Hinga was a marvellous mentor to scores of Auckland University rugby players as well as being a pillar in the community in which he lived,” says Mr Peters.</p>
