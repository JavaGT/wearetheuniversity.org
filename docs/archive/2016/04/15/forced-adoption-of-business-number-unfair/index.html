<p>Forced Adoption of Business Number Unfair</p>
<p>The forced adoption of the New Zealand Business Number for all businesses is unfair, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“The intent of the New Zealand Business Number Bill was to reduce red tape, improve productivity and save costs, however this has been grossly overstated,” says New Zealand First MP Ria Bond, who sits on the Commerce Select Committee.</p>
<p>“The government backed out of making it mandatory for government agencies to be part of the system, failing to back their own legislation which has just passed.</p>
<p>“On the one hand, government agencies have been granted voluntary participation, while on the other, small to medium-sized businesses are forced into compulsory compliance within 28 days of royal assent.</p>
<p>“This is grossly unfair to thousands of businesses that simply cannot afford the time or financial expense of updating their systems to fit within the New Zealand Business Number regime.</p>
<p>“Without total government buy-in, this number will be more burden than blessing for New Zealand businesses.”</p>
