<p>Media Release</p>
<p>12 April 2016</p>
<p>Exciting prospects ahead for Lincoln  </p>
<p>New Chancellor Tony Hall says Lincoln University has a bright future, with increasing student numbers and a big collaborative project in its planning stages.</p>
<p>Formerly Pro-Chancellor, Mr Hall has been elected to the position by the University Council after the retirement of Chancellor Tom Lambie to spend more time on his South Canterbury farm.</p>
<p>“Students have voted confidence in Lincoln by enrolling in increasing numbers, particularly in our land-based specialist programmes,” Mr Hall says.</p>
<p>“It’s an exciting time to be in a governance role at Lincoln as we progress the Lincoln Hub in collaboration with AgResearch, Plant &amp; Food Research, Landcare Research and DairyNZ.”</p>
<p>Mr Hall has been on the Council since 2004.</p>
<p>He wants to highlight the attributes of the Council and the staff of the University, and the “extraordinary contribution they make to Canterbury and New Zealand”.</p>
<p>“I’m also looking forward to working with Professor Robin Pollard, our new Vice-Chancellor.”</p>
<p>Mr Hall lives on a small farm in North Canterbury, and has been involved with farming his whole life, he says.</p>
<p>He is Governing Director of Community Colleges New Zealand, University of Canterbury Council member, Chairman of the Mainpower Trust Board, and a New Zealand Olympic Committee board member and selector, among a number of other business and sporting roles.</p>
<p>He was awarded the Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2007 for services to the community.</p>
