<p><strong>‘Crazy’ business idea built on fresh Kiwi air impresses Innes48 judges</strong></p>
<p>The idea of exporting clean Kiwi air to residents of smog-infested cities has seen a team of students from Waikato Management School win a $1,000 prize for the Gallagher ‘Craziest Idea that Might Just Work’ Award at the Innes48 Business Startup Competition 2016.</p>
<p>After reading that air pollution is one of the world’s top 10 killers, the students came up with the idea of selling portable canisters of fresh New Zealand air – attached to easy-to-use breathing devices - to wealthy consumers living in smoggy cities like Beijing or Moscow. Each canister would hold around 150 breaths of New Zealand air.</p>
<p>“A decade ago, the world was shocked by the introduction of bottled water – a commodity that literally falls from the sky,” says team leader Deanna Morse, who is studying for a Bachelor of Communication Studies at Waikato Management School. “The bottled water industry is now worth over $100 billion globally. Will this be the future of clean air?”</p>
<p>Innes48 is the largest business start-up competition of its kind in New Zealand, open to people of all ages, and was held at Wintec in Hamilton from 8-10 April. Each of the 15 participating teams was given just 48 hours to come up with an original business idea, conduct market research, and write a business plan. Just six teams made it through to the final pitching round.</p>
<p>Along with Deanna, aged 20, the Waikato team included students Emily Svadlenak, 20, (Bachelor of Communication Studies); Richard Liu, 19, Rhandal Meijerink, 21, Mitchell McNae, 20, and Zack Pentecost, 20, (all studying for a Bachelor of Management Studies). Between them, they have knowledge of strategy, international management, finance, supply chain, marketing, public relations and leadership communication.</p>

<p>Deanna says her team deliberately chose a revolutionary product idea that would disrupt society. “As soon as Rhandal pitched the idea of selling air, we knew this was it. It was crazy and we do crazy!”</p>
<p>“Our Friday night was spent researching and discussing how we could differentiate ourselves from our competitors. We went big – shocked by the fact that 40% of the world’s premature deaths are due to air pollution in China. We wanted to make a social, long-term difference – providing New Zealand air as a ventilation system for rooms, focusing on maternity wards and hospitals.”</p>
<p>During Innes48, teams gained new insights from inspirational business mentors and guest speakers about what it takes to become an entrepreneur. Teams also attended quick-fire workshops on business validation, problem-solving, business modelling, finance and pitching.</p>
<p>“We pitched last so we knew we had to project energy, and most importantly, our personalities,” says Deanna. “People laughed; they looked engaged. That was awesome. We were pumped. We put everything into the competition and had fun.”</p>
<p>The judging panel included software entrepreneur Melissa Clark-Reynolds, director of ACCURO and Radio NZ; Robett Hollis, a former pro-snowboarder who now owns several media ventures, including Airtime, New Zealand’s largest action sports network; Graham Gaylard, chair of SODA Inc business incubator and founder of Real Time Genomics, and Chip Dawson, a technology investor who has been a CEO of global organisations for the past 12 years.</p>
<p>The competition’s supreme $10,000 award for Most Viable Business went to DoseDirect, a prescription door-to-door delivery service targeted at the elderly. The $1,000 award for Best Pitch went to Step-by-Step, a New Zealand-based destination wedding service catering exclusively to Chinese couples.</p>
