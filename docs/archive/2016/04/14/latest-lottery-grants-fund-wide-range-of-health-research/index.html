<p><strong>Latest Lottery grants fund wide range of Otago health research</strong></p>
<p>University of Otago researchers have been awarded around $1.7M in funding from the Lottery Grants Board to support studies focusing on improving New Zealanders’ health.</p>
<p>The grants support the purchase of research equipment, scholarships, and the pursuit of research projects that translate into meaningful health outcomes and community benefit.</p>
<p>Researchers from across the University’s three main campuses in Dunedin, Christchurch and Wellington have received 19 translational research grants, and six equipment grants. A full list appears below.</p>
<p>Dr Philippa McDowall (Paediatrics, Wellington) also received a $98,805 Postdoctoral Fellowship in the funding round, while Dr Tristram Ingham (Medicine, Wellington) gained a $105,000 PhD Scholarship.</p>
<p>Nationally, 42 project and equipment grants in the Lottery Health Research 2015/2016 funding round were supported with a total of $2.6M being distributed.</p>
<p>Otago’s new translational research projects involve a wide variety of health-related topics. They range from developing a better model of Alzheimer’s disease to developing wool-derived proteins as bone graft substitutes to assessing the fairness of decision making in the NZ Health Sector.</p>
<p>Also among the projects are studies on topics such as investigations into a potential new target in treating cardiovascular disease, New Zealand’s gun control policy, and high-intensity interval training in type 2 diabetes.</p>
