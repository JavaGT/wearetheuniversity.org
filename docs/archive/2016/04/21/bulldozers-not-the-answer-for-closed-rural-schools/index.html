<p><strong>Tracey Martin MP</strong></p>
<p><strong>Spokesperson for Education</strong><br>21 APRIL 2016  </p>
<p><strong>Bulldozers Not the Answer for Closed Rural Schools</strong></p>
<p>Statements by Ministry of Education officials over the recent demolition of Waikato’s Kereone School buildings, pool and tennis courts are questionable,” says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“In the last 18 months swimming pools have been bulldozed at least at two other closed schools. They were community funded and community built,” says Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“All three of these communities were not notified.</p>
<p>“The Ministry’s claim that it is ‘usual practice’ to demolish closed schools and clear the sites when they are being disposed of does not match with previous practice.</p>
<p>“Once a school is up for disposal, it must first be assessed for any possible treaty settlement before being offered back to the original owners for purchase.</p>
<p>“Associate Minister Nikki Kaye, who has responsibility for schools that have been closed, needs to answer some questions.</p>
<p>“Kereone School had been the focal point for its rural community for over 90 years. Any opportunity to continue using the school buildings, pool and tennis courts has gone.</p>
<p>“Let’s hope bringing in the bulldozers isn’t going to become the norm for schools that have been closed in small communities,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
