<p><strong>Thursday, 21 April 2016, 4:20 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>UC has signed a partnership with geotechnical engineering firm Pells Sullivan Meynink to sponsor a new senior lecturer position in Engineering Geology in the Department of Geological Sciences for five years.</p>
<p>Engineering Geology began at the University of Canterbury as a BSc Honours programme in the late 1960s. This evolved into a full MSc Engineering Programme in 1980. The only full degree programme of its kind in Australasia, the UC programme is of strategic importance to the geotechnical industry in the region.</p>
<p>The newly appointed PSM Senior Lecturer in Engineering Geology, Dr Clark Fenton, has welcomed the support from PSM which he says recognises the strength of the Engineering Geology programme at University of Canterbury and the importance of our graduates to the geotechnical industry.</p>
<p>“Such close collaboration with industry is important in readying our students for the profession by providing access to real world design projects, applied engineering geology dissertation topics, and exposure to all aspects of projects from planning through design and on to construction. The partnership with PSM will also assist in growing the engineering geology research programme at UC, allowing us to remain at the forefront of the science, inform industry best practice and geohazards, design and planning policy.”</p>
<p>PSM provides specialist investigation, analysis and design services for engineering in rock, soil and water. The company was established in 1993 by Philip Pells, Tim Sullivan and Bill Meynink to bring together their substantial experience in the fields of rock mechanics, soil mechanics, engineering geology, hydrogeology, hydrology and mining geomechanics. The company now comprises 64 professionals as well as associated support staff operating from offices in Sydney, Perth and Brisbane and are one of the largest specialist geotechnical consultancies in Australia.</p>
<p>PSM has a reputation for innovative and practical engineering design in the field of geotechnical engineering and hydrology. Ten of PSM’s professional staff are graduates of UC’s Engineering Geology programme, ranging from graduate to Senior Principal and Director levels of the company.</p>
