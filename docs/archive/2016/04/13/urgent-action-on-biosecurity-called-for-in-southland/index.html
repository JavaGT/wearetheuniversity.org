<p>Urgent Action on Biosecurity Called for in Southland</p>
<p>New Zealand First is calling for urgent action on the weed velvetleaf, and questions whether the National Government is placing enough emphasis on biosecurity in Southland.</p>
<p>“Under the watch of Minister for Primary Industries Nathan Guy, discoveries of the invasive weed velvetleaf have climbed,” says New Zealand First List MP based in Invercargill Ria Bond.</p>
<p>“While Environment Southland is treating velvetleaf as a serious threat Mr Guy is silent. Southland farmers deserve better,” says Ms Bond.</p>
<p>New Zealand First Spokesperson for Primary Industries Richard Prosser says the Ministry has known about velvetleaf in Waikato for some time.</p>
<p>“No-one is blaming MPI staff for not being able to achieve the necessary results when they plainly don’t have the necessary resourcing.</p>
<p>“It comes back to the government which must take biosecurity seriously and give it serious funding. This is urgent – every biosecurity failure that isn’t foot and mouth brings the one that is foot and mouth one failure closer.”</p>
<p>“New Zealand First will continue to work hard and hold the Minister to account. He needs to back Southland farmers with meaningful action,” says Ms Bond.</p>
