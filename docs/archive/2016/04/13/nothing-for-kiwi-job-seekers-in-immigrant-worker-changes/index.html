<p><strong>Wednesday, 13 April 2016, 10:29 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong><br>New Zealand First Leader<br>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>13 APRIL 2016</p>
<p><strong>Nothing for Kiwi Job Seekers in Laughable Immigrant Worker Changes</strong></p>
<p>Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse is paying lip service to the flood of low-skilled migrants taking Kiwis jobs.</p>
<p>“In fact, the Minister’s changes for ‘tighter and tidier’ recruitment in lower-skilled work, looks more like a ruse to get migrant workers into jobs faster,” says New Zealand First Leader and MP for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“It is more bureaucratic nonsense that will do nothing for young Kiwis looking for jobs in a competitive market where migrants will accept any conditions. WINZ will be the go-to recruitment agency, but once the paperwork is complete – now named a Skills Match Report – they’ll be free to work through Immigration NZ to hire migrant workers.</p>
<p>“Two less than stellar performing government departments ‘working together’ will be a bureaucratic nightmare. It’s laughable.</p>
<p>“Service stations, supermarkets, hotels, aged care and farmers have hundreds of migrant workers. The Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment raised concerns in December and the OECD described an unmanaged inflow of migrants that would make the job market difficult for ‘natives’.</p>
<p>“Only two weeks ago Mr Woodhouse was denying in Parliament that there was any problem with the flood of low-skilled migrants especially international students.</p>
<p>“Today Mr Woodhouse appears to have done a back flip, but it’s just paper chasing, he has no intention of closing down this cheaper labour market.</p>
<p>“The only fair way to get Kiwis into the job market is to cap immigration, now at net 67,400, and stop the working visas for international students,” says Mr Peters.</p>
