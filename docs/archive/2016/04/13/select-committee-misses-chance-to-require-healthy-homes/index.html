<p>The New Zealand Union of Students&#39; Associations is disappointed the Social Services Select Committee failed to significantly improve the Residential Tenancies Amendment Bill.</p>
<p>NZUSA President Linsey Higgins says she is disheartened by the lack of change.</p>
<p>&quot;The submission process put compelling evidence before the committee on the need to extend the minimum requirements on residential properties to ventilation and fixed forms of heating. It is extremely disappointing that the majority of the committee chose not to listen, even if the government has no interest in what is really needed – a proper warrant of fitness regime.&quot;</p>
<p>“Our select committee submission focused on the appalling conditions that students have to live in currently, and the effects that this has on their wellbeing. Students want houses that don’t make them sick. It is not too much to ask”</p>
<p>“Students are some of the most vulnerable in our society along with children and the elderly. These recommendations do too little to support those in in sub-standard accommodation, they mean there will continue to mean there arefew avenues for redress and the Bill will unfortunatelydo little but perpetuate the current cycle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;While we support the recommendation for harsher penalties for landlords who fall short, the lack of support and protection for tenants to take cases to the Tenancy Tribunal will continue to remain a significant barrier.”</p>
<p>“Affordable warm dry rental accommodation is possible, but the select committee has failed to show initiative and drive forward something that would make real change for those who need it the most.”</p>
