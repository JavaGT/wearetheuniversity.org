<p>Simple Simon Accusing Bus Companies of Ripping Off Supergold Card</p>
<p>Transport Minister Simon Bridges is accusing private bus companies of ripping off the government for SuperGold Card seats, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“He’s picking on seniors, claiming to be cracking down on corrupt practices while his government is encouraging billions of dirty money to be washed through this country and for us to be used for tax evasion,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“The Minister said on Radio NZ today: ‘3pm in Wellington Central, a bus goes down the street we literally have no idea, no data how many Seniors are getting on those buses, we simply pay’.</p>
<p>“Clearly the Minister is saying companies are rorting the system which pays a subsidy – part of the full off-peak fare – when a SuperGold Cardholder presents their card.</p>
<p>“If he’s running a scheme that is badly administered, then it’s no one’s fault but his as Minister Responsible.</p>
<p>“He’s just trying to throw something new into the works, because this government can’t defend its sneaky changes to the scheme that benefits over 640,000 people over 65.</p>
<p>“The funding is now capped at today’s numbers, just as 29,000 hard-working Kiwis reach 65 each year.</p>
<p>“It is like saying as five-year-old school entrant numbers rise, or university numbers increase, we will just cap the cost.</p>

<p>“Responsibility has been forced on regional councils who will have to top up somehow.</p>
<p>“On July 1 the Super Gold Card must be merged into smart cards, and Seniors forced to buy a smart card in each city, and put credit on it.</p>
<p>“It’s all part of shifting the cost and undermining the card.”</p>
