<p>MEDIA STATEMENT  </p>
<p>7 April 2016</p>
<p><strong>Labour mourns loss of Māori academic Matiu Dickson</strong></p>
<p>Tangi kau ana ngā tai e!<br>E te manu whititua. E te pou tokomanawa o ngā whare maire o ngā tūpuna. Tāhuhu kau ana ngā puke I te tonga ka mōkaia ngā tai o Tauranga moana e!</p>
<p>It is with deep sympathy that we acknowledge the passing of Matiu Dickson from Ngai Tukairangi, Ngai Te Rangi, says Labour’s Hauraki-Waikato MP Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
<p>“Matiu was a man of many talents and made an important contribution to Māori education and iwi politics.</p>
<p>“He was a law lecturer at the University of Waikato and shared his immense love for the legal practice through teaching and mentoring students and graduates of law.</p>
<p>“Matiu was focussed on applying his skills and talent to advance Māori aspirations and advocating for te reo Māori.</p>
<p>“He was involved in politics on a local and national level serving as a former Tauranga City Councillor. He also served on the Board of Trustees for Hillcrest High School, was the chair of Te Runanga o Kirikiriroa and he stood as a candidate for the Labour Party.</p>
<p>“He was a former board member of Pharmac, a founding member of the National Urban Māori Authority, a Director of Nga Rau Tatangi, and a judge for Te Matatini senior kapahaka competitions.</p>
<p>“He had a particular skill in bringing people together and forging a shared sense of understanding when it came to the Treaty of Waitangi and Māori aspirations.</p>

<p>“Matiu will be sorely missed. He had a level of optimism and foresight that made people feel secure when seeking his advice. He was a reflective thinker and gave considered opinions on a range of issues.</p>
<p>“Labour’s Māori caucus and the wider party send their sincere condolences to his wife Helen, their six children and four mokopuna.</p>
<p>“Matiu will return to his whanau to Hungahungatoroa Marae in Tauranga. May he rest in peace,” says Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
