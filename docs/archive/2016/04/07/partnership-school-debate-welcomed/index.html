<p><strong>Partnership School debate welcomed</strong></p>
<p><strong>Press release: ACT New Zealand<br>April 7, 2016. 12:45pm</strong></p>
<p>ACT Leader David Seymour welcomes a debate on abolishing partnership schools, but has some questions for bill sponsor Chris Hipkins.</p>
<p>“Has Chris Hipkins ever visited a partnership school?” asks Mr Seymour.</p>
<p>“Does he have the support of Labour MPs with partnership schools in their electorates?</p>
<p>“Will he close down existing partnership schools? If not, why not?</p>
<p>“Did he draft his bill in consultation with the teacher unions? Has he received congratulations from the unions or their offices since his bill was drawn?</p>
<p>“What makes him qualified to overrule the judgment of the hundreds of families who have already made the choice to embrace partnership schools?</p>
<p>“And finally, how does abolishing school choice fit with Labour Prime Minister Peter Fraser’s proclamation <em>‘that every person, whatever his level of academic ability, whether he be rich or poor, whether he live in town or country, has a right as a citizen, to a free education of the kind for which he is best fitted, and to the fullest extent of his powers’</em>?”</p>
