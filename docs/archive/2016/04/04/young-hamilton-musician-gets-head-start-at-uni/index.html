<p>A Hamilton musician has landed a scholarship that covers her uni fees and will help develop her talents as an artist.</p>
<p>Zoe Lapwood, head girl at St Paul’s Collegiate last year, is the recipient of a Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship from the University of Waikato – an all-fees paying scholarship that supports students in a chosen discipline, and provides mentoring, personal development and leadership opportunities while they study.</p>
<p>The scholarships are awarded on the basis of leadership, academic excellence, and achievement in a sport or creative and performing art.</p>
<p>Zoe received the scholarship for her musical talents – a discipline she started at the age of seven.</p>
<p>“I was classically trained when I started but in my high school years I became interested in contemporary music. I’ve always loved music and my passion for songwriting came about when I was involved in the Play It Strange competitions.”</p>
<p>She has been taking piano, guitar and singing lessons since primary school, and has spent the last five years working on songwriting.</p>
<p>“I was a finalist in the Lion Foundation Songwriting competition for three years running, and a runner-up in their Peace Songwriting competition. I’ve also performed in the Beatles and Rolling Stones tribute concert in Auckland Town Hall alongside former Opshop front man Jason Kerrison.”</p>

<p>Playing and performing has led to a number of successes, with Zoe being awarded the Adastra Foundation Scholarship for songwriting. She’s also performed on radio, and has professionally recorded several of her songs on CD.</p>
<p>She also got a spot in the limelight at Easter weekend last week, singing the national anthem at the women’s Black Sticks vs Canada hockey match.</p>
<p>Zoe has already started her first semester at the University of Waikato, studying towards a conjoint degree in law and management. She says the Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship Programme is the right pathway for her to concentrate on both her music and studies.</p>
<p>“The Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship Programme will provide me with the support to continue my music and cover the cost of my fees while I study so that’s got to be good.”<br>ends</p>
