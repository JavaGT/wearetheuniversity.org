<p><strong>Monday, 4 April 2016, 9:06 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Govt Should Put up Cash for Rabbit Research, Not Public</p>
<p>For a Crown Research Institute to have to call on the public to pay for a study on rabbits reveals how appalling the government’s record on funding research and development is, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“Landcare Research is seeking $80,000 from the public to monitor rabbits and create an online mapping tool but the government should be coming up with the cash,” says New Zealand First’s Primary Industries Spokesperson Richard Prosser.</p>
<p>“It makes a mockery of this government’s constant claims that it is boosting R&amp;D.</p>
<p>“The government should also be encouraging innovative schemes in Otago and Canterbury where huge numbers of rabbits exist.</p>
<p>“Tourists, particularly from Europe, love rabbit meat so why isn’t the government encouraging hunters to supply restaurants and other outlets and also the pet food industry?</p>
<p>“Landcare Research is a government research agency and exists to do research; they should not be in the business of running campaigns to extract more money from the public so they can go about their work. Clearly it is underfunded.</p>
<p>“Providing R&amp;D funding is the role of government and this government is shirking that responsibility.</p>
<p>“For Landcare Research to make this appeal shows just how cash-strapped they are,” says Mr Prosser.</p>
