<p><strong>Monday, 4 April 2016, 1:27 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Key Fosters Banana Republic Approach</strong></p>
<p>The just released Panama Papers demonstrate the double standards the National Government has when it comes to taxation.</p>
<p>“Dirty money is being washed through New Zealand to evade tax and hide other serious financial and taxation manipulation,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Whilst the PM has been shaking hands with devious financial operators around the world and promoting our tax system, and doing little to ensure its integrity, we are now known as one of the world’s ‘quiet tax havens’ as the leaked documents reveal.</p>
<p>“While Mr Key talks of being the Switzerland of the Pacific, what he and his colleagues have constructed is a reputation that tracks unscrupulous money dealings and straight out tax evasion.</p>
<p>“This will do nothing for our international reputation.</p>
<p>“It’s harmful to genuine Kiwi companies and any foreign company that wants to invest here.</p>
<p>“Because of our weak laws over 12,000 trusts pay no tax here on their overseas earnings.</p>
<p>“Yet if a Kiwi goes and works in Australia, the IRD is quick to assess their income offshore for liability for tax in NZ.</p>
<p>“Mr Key’s government has deliberately allowed the secrecy of trusts and our loose anti-money laundering laws to be untouched – yet New Zealand’s financial wizards have consistently warned they are doing us harm.</p>

<p>“And worse, when this inequity has been pointed out to him he has shifted responsibility to the OECD. Other countries know such an excuse represents a pathetic lack of leadership and national interest.</p>
<p>“In short, when public funds have been so tight, ordinary workers have been hit hard by the IRD as well as students paying loans, Mr Key has done simply nothing but ‘spray and walk away’.”</p>
