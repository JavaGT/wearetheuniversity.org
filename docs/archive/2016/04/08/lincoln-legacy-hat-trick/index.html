<p>Lincoln legacy hat trick</p>
<p>Students and parents celebrated today as 596 new degree, diploma and certificate holders received their Lincoln University qualification in two graduation ceremonies, either in person at the Lincoln Event Centre, or in absentia.</p>
<p>Among those was third generation graduate Thomas Williams, at the ceremony with his mother, Jennifer Williams, a student at Lincoln in the 1980s, and grandfather, Graham Tate, a student at Lincoln in the 1950s and a lecturer from 1968 to 1991.</p>
<p>Tom, who graduated with a Master of Applied Science in Transport Planning today (8 April), says he is proud to carry on a family tradition but that he chose Lincoln because it was a good fit for his aspirations and gave him the best options for his career choice. He says being a student at Lincoln gave him a sense of empowerment. “It’s up to you to create your own future and the future you want for your city and country.”</p>
<p>Currently working for the Department of Conservation (DOC) in a part-time role, Tom has been accepted to the University of Amsterdam for a one month summer course in transport planning and will head overseas in June to complete this, all part of his long term goal of working in the transport planning industry.</p>
<p>Jennifer graduated with a Diploma in Horticulture followed by a Parks and Recreation degree in the early 80s, and has since worked in national parks around the country, always using her horticulture and environmental qualifications. Currently working for DOC on Stewart Island, Jennifer will head to Antarctica later this year with Heritage Expeditions as a DOC observer on a research vessel.</p>

<p>Graham came to Lincoln from Auckland as part of Rural Field Cadetship scheme aimed at training young recruits to work in government departments in the 1950s. He was one of the first intake of students at the newly built Hudson Hall.</p>
<p>After graduating with a Diploma in Valuation and Farm Management in 1957, Graham worked for the State Advances Corporation settling ex-soldiers on land around New Zealand. He returned to Lincoln in 1968 as a lecturer in Farm Management and was one of three staff members who set up the Kellogg Rural Leadership Programme aimed at supporting the development of rural and agricultural leaders. In the 1980s he graduated again with a Master of Science specialising in Resource Management.</p>
<p>Presiding over his 12th and last graduation ceremony today, Chancellor Tom Lambie told graduands they now have the capability to make a worthy contribution to economies, environments and societies around the world.</p>
