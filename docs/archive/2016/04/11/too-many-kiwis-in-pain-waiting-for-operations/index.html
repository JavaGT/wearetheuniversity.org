<p>Too many Kiwis in pain waiting for operations</p>
<p>The Health Minister must take urgent action to help the 174,000 New Zealanders that a new report estimates can’t even get on a waiting list for surgery, Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“A new report by global research company TNS says these 174,000 Kiwis have been turned down for publicly-funded operations because their pain is not considered severe enough or their GPs want to monitor their conditions.</p>
<p>“Canterbury Charity Hospital founder Phil Bagshaw estimated that 8 per cent of Aucklanders and 10 per cent of Cantabrians who require surgery are not ‘registered by the system’.</p>
<p>“These findings are a direct result of the Government cutting $1.7 billion of funding for the health sector over the past six years.</p>
<p>“It follows research from Dunedin School of Medicine showing that people who would have qualified for hip and knee surgery six years ago, would not qualify today.</p>
<p>“Jonathan Coleman refuses to acknowledge the patients who need surgery but have not been referred by their GP to a specialist because they know it is too hard to get surgery. Doctors know their patients won’t get on the waiting list so don’t bother even trying.</p>
<p>“The National Government has failed to fund the health sector to meeting a growing elderly population and inflation. Kiwis are in more pain and missing out on the healthcare they need,” Annette King says.</p>
