<p>Victoria student makes strong case for volunteering</p>
<p>A Victoria University of Wellington student is combining her passion for volunteering with her love of the law by helping to teach local young people their legal rights.</p>
<p>Fifth year Law, Anthropology and Māori Studies student Mariah Hori Te Pa is a volunteer at the Wellington Community Justice Project (WCJP)—a student-run charity that aims to improve access to legal services in the community.</p>
<p>Mariah is one of many students being celebrated as part of Victoria’s Student Volunteer Week, running from 11–17 April in association with Volunteering New Zealand, which highlights the important work volunteers carry out and the opportunities available to students.</p>
<p>The WCJP works with organisations like the Wellington Community Law Centre, the Human Rights Commission and the Restorative Justice Trust.</p>
<p>“Our volunteers work in four different areas—advocacy, human rights, law reform and education,” says Mariah. “I’m one of the education team leaders, and we send student volunteers to high schools and alternative education centres in the Wellington region. They teach young people about their legal rights and responsibilities on a range of legal topics, like police, employment, and alcohol and drugs.”</p>
<p>Mariah liaises between student volunteers and the schools to organise presentations. She can work up to 15 hours each week and considers it a “part-time job”.</p>

<p>Mariah says the WCJP offers Victoria&#39;s law students the chance to gain practical legal experience while contributing to the community.</p>
<p>“I volunteer because it gives me a purpose. I found the work so rewarding and important as a presenter that I decided to become one of three team leaders last year. Students have the power to make a really positive impact on people’s lives.”</p>
<p>Mariah has also been involved in other volunteering activities at Victoria, including mentoring first-year Māori and Pasifika law students, and note-taking for students with impairments.</p>
<p>She has recently been awarded the John Miller Award in Social Justice and Community Development from the University, and will be receiving the Victoria Plus Award later this year in recognition of her significant contribution to service and leadership.</p>
<p>“I am truly passionate about contributing to society in a meaningful way, and in particular, serving the most vulnerable people in our communities,” she says. “I plan to continue using my legal knowledge after I’ve left University to help disadvantaged people.”</p>
