<p><strong>Green Party Members’ Bills pulled from ballot</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party is thrilled to have two important bills drawn from the ballot today, both of which will help to create a fairer Aotearoa.</p>
<p>Jan Logie’s <a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/policy/fairer-society/domestic-violence-victims-protection-bill">Domestic Violence-Victims&#39; Protection Bill</a> introduces workplace protections for victims of domestic violence, including allowing victims to request paid domestic violence leave for up to 10 days.</p>
<p>“I’m very pleased that my Bill has been drawn because helping victims of abuse stay in work is critical to reducing the effects of violence. When women leave a violent situation it can be very hard for them to juggle court, counselling, housing, and the needs of their children,” said Ms Logie.</p>
<p>“Progressive employers are already leading the way on this issue. It’s time to even the playing field across New Zealand for victims and businesses.</p>
<p>“A secure job means victims are much more able to maintain economic independence, and it helps them to find a pathway out of violence to successfully rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>“The bill will clarify that Domestic Violence is a health and safety hazard, and will strengthen flexible working arrangements to ensure they are fit for purpose.</p>
<p>“It’s also particularly timely because there is a growing movement for businesses and workplaces to adopt family violence policies, such as the Human Rights’ Commission’s <a href="https://www.hrc.co.nz/news/businesses-and-workplaces-encouraged-adopt-policies-address-family-violence/">new campaign</a>,” said Ms Logie.</p>

<p>Gareth Hughes’ <a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/policy/fairer-society/faster-into-homes">First Home Student Loan Repayment Diversion Bill</a> allows Kiwis with student loans to defer their student loan repayments into a first home savings scheme.</p>
<p>“Many young people are struggling to get a house deposit together and my bill will make it easier and faster for them to get a foot in the door of their own home,” said Mr Hughes.</p>
<p>“Combined with KiwiSaver, this would make a huge difference for young people who are struggling with low wage growth and rapidly rising house prices across the country. For example, a bachelor’s graduate on a median wage could save $18,000 after five years with this diversion.</p>
<p>“Helping young people to buy a house will also encourage them to remain in New Zealand to contribute to our economy and our communities,” said Mr Hughes.</p>
