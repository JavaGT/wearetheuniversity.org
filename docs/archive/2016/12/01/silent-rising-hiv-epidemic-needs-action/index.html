<p>Dr Peter Saxton</p>
<p>The world’s most dangerous infectious disease epidemic of the modern era is reviving, but are we prepared in New Zealand?</p>
<p>The trends are disturbing, says Dr Peter Saxton, the inaugural New Zealand AIDS Foundation Fellow at the School of Population Health, University of Auckland.</p>
<p>Last year New Zealand recorded the highest number of annual HIV diagnoses ever - the fourth increase in a row. Many of these are recent infections. This World AIDS Day, more individuals are living with HIV in New Zealand than ever before.</p>
<p>Dr Saxton says, &quot;experience tells us that HIV evades control when we let down our guard. This virus has killed 40 million people worldwide. Two and a half million people contracted HIV in 2015. Media hype aside, after three decades we still have no vaccine and no cure.&quot;</p>
<p>Treatment for HIV is effective but expenditure on anti-retrovirals is soaring, doubling in the last six years from $16.8 million in 2011 to $32.8 million in 2016.</p>
<p>It’s estimated that one person diagnosed with HIV at age 20 in New Zealand could cost Pharmac more than $800,000 in anti-HIV treatments over their lifetime. </p>
<p>&quot;Given these statistics it’s hard to argue that we have the upper hand,&quot; he says. &quot;That’s why experts agree that prevention makes so much sense, scientifically, morally and fiscally. We know prevention works.</p>
<p>&quot;It should be accessible to those who need it most. And for every new infection averted, we can redirect the savings towards other much needed health issues. Investing in HIV has a broad payoff.</p>
<p>&quot;Our escalating epidemic is inexcusable and it risks squandering our proud historical record. When New Zealand saw the first cases more than thirty years ago, the country responded boldly,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;Interventions were based on evidence and we agreed on rational policies, bi-partisan political engagement and urgency.  Moralism was rejected in favour of science and cooperation.  The result was an international success story.&quot;</p>
<p>New Zealand was one of the first countries in the world to report a decline in AIDS, and we had one of the lowest rates of HIV diagnoses in gay and bisexual men internationally.</p>
<p>These days, life saving treatments now mean that people living with HIV can expect a near-normal lifespan if diagnosed early, but effective treatments can also diminish HIV’s visibility and reduce support for public health efforts at all levels of society and government.</p>
<p>&quot;Meanwhile, Internet dating is connecting potential sexual partners like never before and there are concerns that drug- use particularly methamphetamine, is facilitating HIV transmission through unprotected sex,&quot; says Dr Saxton. &quot;Add stigma to the mix and HIV has become a silent and growing epidemic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To make matters worse, New Zealand has a distintegrating HIV and sexual health workforce badly in need of re-investment,&quot; he says.  &quot;Despite this, a return to a partnership approach could see New Zealand virtually eliminate HIV transmission within 15 years.</p>
<p>&quot;This would require continued safe sex promotion, more frequent HIV testing, and adding two new tools to the mix.</p>
<p>&quot;The first tool is making HIV treatment immediately available for people who test HIV positive. This improves long term health, but it also makes someone living with HIV almost uninfectious.&quot;</p>
<p>The second tool is offering the same HIV treatments as daily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to the small number of uninfected individuals at very high risk of contracting HIV. Studies have shown that PrEP reduces the risk of acquiring HIV by 86-92 percent.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation has recommended immediate introduction for both HIV treatment and PrEP, but New Zealand still lags behind.</p>
<p>&quot;We urgently need re-engagement and action on HIV. We need to address the inequities that see 80 percent of HIV transmission occurring among gay and bisexual men,&quot; says Dr Saxton.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to evolve and modernise our own responses just as HIV has evolved from a frightening disease in the 1980s to a silent, expanding and expensive epidemic today.&quot;</p>
