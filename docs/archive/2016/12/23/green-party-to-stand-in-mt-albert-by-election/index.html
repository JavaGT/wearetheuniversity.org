<p><strong>Friday, 23 December 2016, 10:26 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>23 December 2016<br>Green Party to stand in Mt Albert by-election</p>
<p>The Green Party will be standing a candidate in the 2017 Mt Albert by-election.</p>
<p>“2017 will be the year New Zealanders opt for a positive and progressive government. The Mt Albert by-election is the start of that,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>“Aucklanders want MPs in Wellington who know the frustration of not being able to buy a house, of not earning enough to put food on the table and pay the rent, or of sitting in endless traffic jams.</p>
<p>“Most of all, they want MPs who’ll stand up for them and help make their lives better with positive, affordable solutions to the issues that matter.</p>
<p>“Aucklanders aren’t getting that from Bill English’s government and they’re hungry for change.</p>
<p>“If selected, Labour has a very strong likely candidate in Jacinda Ardern and she will be the favourite to win. However that’s not a reason for us, or any other party, to not field a candidate.</p>
<p>“The people of Mt Albert deserve to hear more than just one view on the issues they care about – that is their democratic right.</p>
<p>“It was weak of Bill English to opt out of running a National Party candidate in Mt Albert. He’s denied thousands of Aucklanders the chance to engage with the government on whether they’re ever going to fix the city’s traffic-clogged roads, or finally put first-time homebuyers before property speculators.</p>
<p>“The Green Party can’t wait to hit the streets and have these debates and discussions with the people of Mt Albert,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
<p>The Green Party will select its candidate early in the New Year.</p>
<p>“We will select a talented, credible and dynamic candidate, who will be an excellent voice in Parliament for the people of Mt Albert,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
