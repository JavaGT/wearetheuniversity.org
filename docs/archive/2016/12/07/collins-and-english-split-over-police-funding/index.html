<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>7 December 2016</p>
<p>Collins and English split over police funding</p>
<p>The bloodletting has already begun with splits and divisions emerging after the Police Minister knifed the Finance Minister via the media, says Labour Police spokesman Stuart Nash.</p>
<p>“In an interview Judith Collins reckons her requests for more police are being held up by Finance Minister Bill English.</p>
<p>“In an obvious attack move, Judith Collins stated: ‘I need more police, I absolutely need more police.. and I need them now’ but then she went on to say she had been working on a plan since June.</p>
<p>“In a veiled dig at Bill English’s vacillation, an unfortunate trait he is well-known for, she stated there is ‘engineering and overthinking that can happen when a party has been in government for some time and it’s really important that we just get on with the job.’</p>
<p>“In October when Labour launched a policy for a thousand more police on the streets Collins had the opportunity to share her plan then but did not.</p>
<p>“Labour knows there is an absolute need for more Police because the public and the Police themselves keep telling us and this is backed up by the rising crime statistics.</p>
<p>“The Police Minister has all but admitted she made a mistake when she signed off on the Police four year plan in May which was effectively a funding freeze. No more cops until 2020. Now she expects us to believe she’s been incredibly frustrated by the lack of any clear decision making.</p>
<p>“Safer communities seem further out of reach under this Government now that the leadership battle has turned into a theatre of war with Collins striking the first blow. Expect more blood on the floor, no matter who ends up in charge,” says Stuart Nash.</p>
