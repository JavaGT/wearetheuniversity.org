<p>The first person in her family to earn a tertiary qualification, Nina Vailu’u will graduate in the University of Canterbury (UC) graduation ceremony for the College of Education, Health and Human Development on Wednesday, 14 December.</p>
<p>It was 18 months ago, when she was half-way through her three-year Bachelor of Teaching and Learning (Primary) studies, that she starred in what turned out to be a prescient photoshoot at Cotswold School as part of an advertising campaign.</p>
<p>An award-winning student, Nina had many schools wanting her to work for them before graduation. However, the serendipitous photoshoot predicted Nina’s future.</p>
<p>In a ‘back to the future’ twist, Nina recently accepted her first job as a teacher at Cotswold School. In a further coincidence, she also had her very first student teaching placement at Cotswold School three years ago.</p>
<p>Now she’s getting ready to start teaching Year Two pupils full-time at the Christchurch school next year.</p>
<p>Before studying at UC, Nina had been living overseas pursuing a very different career path.</p>
<p>“I was working in hospitality, working as a manager in a bar and in restaurants, and lived in Wales for a while. Part of the plan was to come back to study teaching in Christchurch,” she says.</p>
<p>Here’s a Q&amp;A Nina did while studying at UC:</p>
<p><strong>How did it feel starting UC as a mature student?</strong><br>Great. I didn’t want to go straight to uni at age 18. I wanted to gain more maturity and life experience first.<br><strong>Have you found yourself in good company?</strong><br>Definitely. I generally hang out with other mature students – there are a lot more than I thought there would be! It&#39;s nice to be in the same boat. We tend to share the same priorities and attitudes.<br><strong>How has UC helped you get back into studying?</strong><br>There are so many workshops you can go to. The Academic Skills sessions in the library are great. The Pacific Development Team has also really helped.<br><strong>Tell us about the Pacific Development Team.</strong><br>It’s like a community within the wider community. I’m half Samoan but after the earthquakes, all my Samoan family left Christchurch. Through the Pacific Development Team I’ve been able to regain that connection.<br><strong>What’s your favourite part of the UC experience?</strong><br>The people. I have such great relationships with my lecturers. They genuinely care about you. The course itself has been really practical. I’ve had a lot of those ‘a-ha moments’ when the theories you learn in class come to life in practise.<br><strong>Your proudest achievement so far?</strong><br>Getting the Pacific Achievers College Award two years in a row and having my parents at the ceremony. I’m the first person in my family to go to university and they had been a bit unsure about me studying teaching. Now they’re both 100% behind me. I’m really proud that I’ve achieved what I set out to achieve.<br><strong>How have you grown at UC?</strong><br>I’ve become much more confident in who I am. To be a good teacher you have to be able to identify your biases and know yourself really well. We ask ‘why’ a lot – it’s been enlightening!<br><strong>What does having a degree from UC mean for your future?</strong><br>I can have the career I want and I can travel. UC is a friendly and supportive environment to get where you need to go, and have a great time along the way.</p>
<p><strong>UC Graduation Ceremonies</strong> will be held on 14 and 16 December 2016 in the Horncastle Arena as follows:<br><strong>Wednesday 14 December 2016</strong><br>• 10am Colleges and Faculties of Engineering &amp; Forestry, and Arts<br>• 2pm College of Education, Health and Human Development<br><strong>Friday 16 December 2016</strong><br>• 10am Colleges of Law &amp; Commerce and Science).</p>
