<p><strong>NATIONAL’S INDIFFERENCE TO MIGRANT EXPLOITATION A DISGRACE</strong></p>
<p>Migrant worker exploitation is just another disgrace the National Party can add to its expanding list of shame, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters says.</p>
<p>“Behind all the spin and PR garbage flowing out of the Beehive, under National this country has become a sadder, harder place and now we are getting work place conditions that resemble those found in the mean backstreets of Kolkata, Manila, and Beijing.</p>
<p>“A new report by University of Auckland researchers compiled over three years about widespread migrant<a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11766210">exploitation</a> in all sectors of our economy – construction, fishing, hospitality, dairy, horticulture, viticulture, international education – is nothing new.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First has been saying this for a long time.</p>
<p>“The government want a cheap subservient workforce to prop up the economy and with migrant workers they’ve got it.</p>
<p>“They’re happy to turn a blind eye to the rotten practices that are going on, both by some foreign and Kiwi employers.</p>
<p>“How can the government deny this when they have a ‘Dad’s Army’ Labour Inspectorate with the pitiful number of 54 officers for the entire country to combat the problem.</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s tradition of a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay and the Kiwi way of life are being blown out of the water and our reputation as a fair and just society country is going down the plug hole.</p>
<p>“National is failing to defend the most basic of human rights for these victims of employment abuse,” says Mr Peters.</p>
