<p>National must act now to stop workplace abuse</p>
<p><a href="http://media.wix.com/ugd/2ffdf5_28e9975b6be2454f8f823c60d1bfdba0.pdf">Today’s report on migrant exploitation</a> shows that the Government is not doing enough to protect workers or to weed out dodgy employers, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>The University of Auckland’s report consists of more than a hundred interviews with migrant workers showing that abuse, underpay, excessive overtime and threats are commonplace in industries like horticulture and hospitality.</p>
<p>“This report echoes what we have known for a long time; National’s refusal to properly look after people on temporary work visas is having serious consequences,” said Green Party immigration spokesperson Denise Roche.</p>
<p>“Exploitation and abuse of migrant workers has been an open secret for a long time, but National refuses to take the necessary steps to prevent further abuses happening, by ensuring amnesty for people who come forward.</p>
<p>“We cannot reasonably expect people to report abuse and exploitation to the authorities if they face being deported as a result.</p>
<p>“If this Government wants to prevent this kind of abuse from getting worse, they need to properly resource the labour inspectorate to ensure that dodgy employers are held accountable.</p>
<p>“At present, nearly one in five investigations into suspected breaches of minimum employment standards are not completed within six monthsof the complaint being made.</p>
<p>“National has also made it easier for exploitative employment situations to happen by hampering unions’ efforts to provide advice and support to people who want to speak up.</p>
<p>“It’s just not the Kiwi way to stand idly by while people are overworked and underpaid. All workers deserves to be treated with respect and dignity,” said Ms Roche.</p>
