<p>Denying Most Kiwis Live Cricket Not a Fair Go</p>
<p>Kiwis are again being denied the chance of seeing top live free-to-air sport on television over the Christmas-New Year break when the Blackcaps take on Bangladesh, says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Sport and Recreation Clayton Mitchell.</p>
<p>“This time of year Kiwis love to get together with friends and family and it can be a great chance to enjoy some top sport together.</p>
<p>“This used to happen but these days with pay-to-view television hundreds of thousands of Kiwis miss out because they cannot afford to pay for Sky. More than one million homes in New Zealand don’t have Sky.</p>
<p>“On Boxing Day, the Blackcaps play Bangladesh at Hagley Oval in Christchurch which is one of the few days in the year when most Kiwis are not working.</p>
<p>“Only those who attend the match and people who can afford Sky will be able to see it.</p>
<p>“This is totally wrong; why should Kiwis have to pay over and over – to fund state television, to put money into sport and then to a private broadcaster?</p>
<p>“Also, New Zealand is lagging behind other countries such as Australia and the UK which ensure sports events are televised live.</p>
<p>“Broadcasting games of national significance will ensure sports that are significant to New Zealanders will be screened live and free-to-air,” says Mr Mitchell.</p>
