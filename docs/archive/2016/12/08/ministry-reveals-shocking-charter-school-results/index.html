<p>MEDIA STATEMENT  </p>
<p>8 December 2016</p>
<p>Ministry reveals shocking charter school results</p>
<p>NCEA results for charter schools have been massively overstated with documents revealing many students leaving school without basic NCEA level two qualifications despite this being a main educational target for the Government, says Labour Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins.</p>
<p>“Documents obtained by Labour show charter schools’ NCEA results have been inflated because the schools have been using a different methodology from other schools. In one case a school reported a 93.3 per cent pass rate when the facts show only 6.7 per cent of leavers achieved NCEA level two.</p>
<p>“It’s disappointing that we’re not getting apples for apples comparisons but it’s even more disturbing that many kids are leaving these schools without the qualifications the Government says every child needs.</p>
<p>“The latest Ministry annual report data also shows charter schools’ National Standards results are actually in decline.</p>
<p>“Last year charter schools were awarded performance bonuses for their results while state schools are staring in the face of major funding cuts next year.</p>
<p>“Hekia Parata is expected to make another announcement on performance bonuses for these schools imminently.</p>
<p>“Surely she can’t be thinking of dishing out another round of bonuses for charter schools when state schools are struggling to cope and donations from parents are rising at ten times the rate of inflation?</p>
<p>“It’s simply not fair that students are leaving these school with minimal qualifications while charter schools receive special treatment as state schools struggle,” says Chris Hipkins.</p>
