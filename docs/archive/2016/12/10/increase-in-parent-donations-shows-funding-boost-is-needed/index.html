<p>Increase in parent donations shows funding boost is needed for education</p>
<p>10 December 2016</p>
<p>The marked increase in parental donations over the past year shows an urgent need to spend public money on increased education funding, not tax cuts, NZEI Te Riu Roa says.</p>
<p>Figures published today show parental donations have continued to rise over the past three years but leapt by $11.8 million in 2015 -- while Government spending per primary school student remains below the OECD average.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa president Louise Green says a NZEI survey of principals last month suggests many schools will need to seek even larger donations and cut teacher aides next year because of the Government&#39;s freeze on school funding in the 2016 Budget.</p>
<p>Current education funding is simply not sustainable and threatens Kiwi children&#39;s right to free and equitable public education, she says.</p>
<p>&quot;John Key talked earlier this week in one of his final interviews as Prime Minister about education as an essential lever to give children in poverty a chance in life. But when schools are relying on donations for core business such as paying teacher aides to support children&#39;s learning and keeping playgrounds open, something is wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>She said a recent example of the equity challenge created by under-funding of schools was a Queenstown primary school benefiting to the tune of $250,000 from the profits of the sale of a house built by local firms.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously this was a great boost to that school and a generous gift from local companies, but it relied on a high income community and the housing bubble to make it happen - and ironically the Queenstown area is currently struggling to attract teachers because of the high house prices.</p>
<p>&quot;This type of fundraising simply isn&#39;t an option though for most primary schools who cannot attract private philanthropy or international students, and whose parent communities are already struggling financially.&quot;</p>
<p>She says the Government needs to restore funding for both schools and ECE services if it is serious about a real commitment to children and their future.</p>
