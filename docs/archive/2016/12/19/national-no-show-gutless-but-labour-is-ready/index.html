<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>19 December 2016</p>
<p>National no-show gutless, but Labour is ready</p>
<p>Labour is ready and keen to talk about the problems facing electors in Mt Albert despite the gutless decision of Bill English not to front a National candidate there, says Labour Deputy Leader Annette King.</p>
<p>“English is running scared from his first test as a leader. He clearly doesn’t want another bloody nose after the Mt Roskill defeat.</p>
<p>“We are more than ready for another contest and relish the chance to talk to people in Mt Albert about how Labour can help them deal with the problems around rising crime, health, public transport and housing affordability.</p>
<p>“It’s typical of National. They don’t like building houses, so they don’t have a Housing Minister. They don’t like by-elections so they don’t run in them.</p>
<p>“We take nothing for granted and will be seeking a mandate for Labour’s new candidate in Mt Albert. As we showed in Mt Roskill, we are ready to fight a by-election and a general election.</p>
<p>“The easiest solution really is for Bill English to do everyone a favour. For tens of thousands of Kiwis a change of government can’t come soon enough so let’s save the cost of a by-election and bring forward the general election,” says Annette King.</p>
