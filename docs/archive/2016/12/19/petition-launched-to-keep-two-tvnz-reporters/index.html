<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>19 December 2016</p>
<p><strong>Petition launched to keep two TVNZ reporters for region bigger than Switzerland, Slovenia and Luxembourg</strong></p>
<p>TVNZ’s refusal to properly resource its coverage of the Otago Southland region is generating a local backlash and demonstrates an utter lack of commitment to regional New Zealand, Labour’s Broadcasting Spokesperson Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>“It is absolutely outrageous that in a geographic area larger than Switzerland, Slovenia and Luxembourg combined, there is only one full time reporter.”</p>
<p>“The second reporter position was recently vacated after the community won the battle to retain the position around a year ago.</p>
<p>“Today I am launching a petition calling on TVNZ to fund a second reporter and have written to all the Mayors in Otago and Southland seeking their support (see <a href="https://www.change.org/p/kevin-kenrick-chief-executive-of-television-new-zealand-regional-reporting-matters-restore-otago-southland-tvnz-reporters">https://www.change.org/p/kevin-kenrick-chief-executive-of-television-new-zealand-regional-reporting-matters-restore-otago-southland-tvnz-reporters</a>)</p>
<p>“TVNZ Chief Executive Kevin Kendrick has refused to commit to replacing the second Otago Southland reporter, and even suggested that there may be further cuts to regional reporting as TVNZ focuses on population concentration.</p>
<p>“This is a matter of grave concern for any region as we are being left in the cold by the state owned broadcaster.</p>

<p>“A letter sent to seven mayors across Otago Southland on Friday 16 December has so far resulted in a show of support from Central Otago Mayor Tim Cadogan and Invercargill Mayor Tim Shadbolt.</p>
<p>“TVNZ is a government owned television network and I find it worrying that they consider their strategy to be moving towards being more urban-centred and Auckland focussed. This is a microcosm of a wider struggle across the rural regions of New Zealand, where we are seeing resources being drained and funding being diverted,” says Clare Curran.</p>
