<p><strong>Sunday, 4 December 2016, 9:37 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Local farmer and rural banker Tim van de Molen has been selected by National to contest the Waikato electorate at the 2017 General Election.</p>
<p>Mr van de Molen has lived in the Waikato region for most of his life. He currently works as a Rural Manager for Rabobank and owns a number of small businesses. In 2013, he won the prestigious NZ Young Farmer of the Year award. Outside of work he is active in the Army Reserves and serves on the Tamahere Community Committee.</p>
<p>“Waikato is my home, the place I love, so I’m really thrilled to be selected,” Mr van de Molen says.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a strong understanding of the needs and aspirations of Waikato communities and will be working hard to earn the privilege of representing them in Wellington.</p>
<p>“Obviously we’re well known as being a pretty rural part of the country, but despite that reputation the Waikato isn’t just all cows and crops.</p>
<p>“We’ve got an increasingly diverse economy, with tourism and manufacturing growing in importance. My background in business, banking, and of course as a farmer gives me the broad experience to back hardworking locals who are getting ahead under this National-led Government.</p>
<p>The Waikato electorate covers from Tuakau in the north, surrounds Hamilton east and stretches inland to Matamata. It is currently held by National’s Lindsay Tisch who is retiring from Parliament.</p>
<p>“I want to thank Lindsay for his years of service to National and wish him well in his retirement from Parliamentary politics. He’s been a dedicated local MP and a staunch supporter of the party in his various roles,” Mr van de Molen says</p>
