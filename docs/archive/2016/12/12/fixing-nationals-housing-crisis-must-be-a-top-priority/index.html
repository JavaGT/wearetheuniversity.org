<p>Fixing National’s housing crisis must be a top priority for English and Bennett</p>
<p>Incoming Prime Minister Bill English should make a commitment to all New Zealanders that he will do what John Key refused to – build more affordable homes, close tax loopholes for property speculators, and end homelessness, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>The median Auckland house now costs $851,944 and the median house price nationwide is now $520,000, a new record high, according to<a href="https://reinz.co.nz/residential-property-data-gallery">data released today</a> by the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (REINZ).</p>
<p>“Bill English needs to make fixing the housing crisis a top priority and he should start by committing his Government to building tens of thousands of affordable homes,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>“I think Bill English knows that one of the most effective ways to fix the broken housing market and address property speculation would be a capital gains tax (excluding the family home) – he just hasn’t had the guts to follow through with implementing it.</p>
<p>“A capital gains tax (excluding the family home) is one of several demand-side tools Bill English could and should use, along with addressing negative gearing and stopping overseas investors from buying up houses and residential land.</p>
<p>“Bill English shouldn’t leave the demand-side policies to the Reserve Bank like John Key did, because the Reserve Bank’s loan-to-value ratios haven’t been able to stop the median Auckland house price increasing by more than quarter of a million dollars since they were introduced in late 2013.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, Bill English and his new deputy Paula Bennett have a history of exacerbating the housing crisis, including engineering a<a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/news/press-release/govt-seeking-overseas-buyers-christchurch-state-homes">massive sell-off of state houses</a>, rather than taking meaningful action to fix it.</p>
<p>“As Social Housing Minister, Paula Bennett looked like she was making things up as she went along, but now as Deputy Prime Minister I hope she can take a more strategic approach to ending homelessness.</p>
<p>“The Green Party’s <a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/home-for-life">Home for Life plan</a> would see thousands of new affordable homes made available to people on lower incomes through a progressive ownership rent-to-buy programme, and thousands more new homes built in partnership with the community housing sector,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
