<p>Leader of the Opposition</p>
<p>MEDIA STATEMENT<br>12 December 2016</p>
<p>Congratulations Bill English: so what’s new?</p>
<p>The Labour Party congratulates Bill English on his appointment today; but his challenge now is to prove there will be a difference, says Labour Leader Andrew Little.</p>
<p>“We have pressing problems facing New Zealand right now, and we need to see solutions urgently.</p>
<p>“When will young New Zealanders presently shut out of owning their own home get a chance to fulfil their dream?</p>
<p>“Is the change in leadership really going to make this Government understand that thousands of New Zealanders don’t have a roof over their heads, or can’t get the hospital care they need, and that parents worry that their kids are not getting the education they deserve.</p>
<p>“And some things could get much worse. On many issues, English’s values aren&#39;t New Zealanders’ values. He voted against marriage equality. We know he favours privatising prisons and selling state houses.</p>
<p>“New Zealand has moved on. But Bill English hasn’t. The ring wing rump of National under English is now reasserting itself.</p>
<p>“The new Prime Minister has some big questions to urgently answer.</p>
<p>“How will he solve the housing crisis? Will he build houses and crack down on speculators?</p>
<p>“Will he have the courage to listen to Judith Collins and agree to put more Police on our streets to keep communities safe?</p>
<p>“How will he deal with Jonathan Coleman who wants health spending to be prioritised over tax cuts that he and new Finance Minister Steven Joyce favour? As Joyce said on Q&amp;A yesterday, ‘you’ve got to keep tax [cuts] on the table’.</p>
<p>“I urge Bill English to use the summer break to come to the realisation that New Zealanders are facing serious problems and show how he will make a difference,” says Andrew Little.</p>
