<p>Govt’s big plan for Auckland housing missing the target</p>
<p>News that National’s Auckland Housing Accord is likely to miss its target for the number of homes actually built shows that new ideas under a new Government are needed to fix the housing crisis, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>The Housing Accord’s three-year target of 39,000 new homes and sections is reportedly likely to fall short by around 1,000, with just 7,000 actual new builds in the last year, <a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/319591/auckland-housing-accord-set-to-miss-target">according to Radio New Zealand</a>.</p>
<p>“The Housing Accord was National’s flagship policy to fix the Auckland housing crisis and it clearly isn’t working,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>“John Key and Nick Smith have spent three years trumpeting the Special Housing Areas (SHA), but there are now <a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/319542/more-of-auckland-joins-million-dollar-club">almost 100 Auckland suburbs</a> where the median price is over $1 million and some SHAs still don’t have any new homes built in them.</p>
<p>“The Government’s supply-side ‘fix’ to the housing affordability problem is failing and the home-ownership dream is now more out of reach for working families than ever before.</p>
<p>“Areas like Waitakere used to be affordable for families on average incomes but now there aren’t any western suburbs with median prices less than the $600,000 Kiwisaver Homestart limit.</p>

<p>“While the Housing Accord hasn’t fixed the supply side problems, the Government has also largely ignored potential demand-side measures to address property speculation and overseas investment.</p>
<p>“A capital gains tax (excluding the family home) and a ban on non-resident overseas investors are the best steps to help dampen property speculation.</p>
<p>“In government, the Green Party will open the toolbox and build thousands of affordable homes, and make some available to first home buyers through a <a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/home-for-life">progressive ownership</a> rent-to-buy programme.</p>
<p>“When even young families with good incomes can’t afford to buy a home in Auckland, the Green Party will help them by putting their <a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/policy/fairer-society/faster-into-homes">student loan repayments on hold</a> while they save for a first home deposit,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
