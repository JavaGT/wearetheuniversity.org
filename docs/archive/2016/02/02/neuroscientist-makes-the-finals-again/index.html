<p>Dr Malvindar Singh-Bains</p>
<p>A neuroscientist committed to promoting brain health and awareness of neurodegenerative diseases is one of three finalists for the 2016 Young New Zealander of the Year award, to be announced on February 17.</p>
<p>Dr Malvindar Singh-Bains works at the University of Auckland’s Centre for Brain Research as a post-doctoral research fellow investigating neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases.</p>
<p>This is the second year in succession that she has been nominated for the award and made the final three. The other two finalists for Young New Zealander this year are world number one golfer, Lydia Ko and fashion designer, Sean Kelly.</p>
<p>In September last year Malvindar was awarded a prestigious four-year fellowship by the Freemasons Foundation to carry out a detailed neuroanatomical study investigating inflammation and mechanisms of degeneration in the human brain.</p>
<p>For the past ten years, her passion for improving the lives of those with incurable diseases has developed into a passion for research into brain disease and for promoting brain health and awareness of the impact of brain diseases.</p>
<p>Malvindar was both academic Dux Litterarum and Head Girl at Waitakere College in 2005 and was awarded a University of Auckland Undergraduate Scholarship to undertake her Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Science.</p>
<p>The following year she competed in the National three-day Accor $10 Queenstown Race, where she raised $7000 for the CureKids Foundation for research into the medical condition Long QT Syndrome. The race required months of fundraising, with the event itself involving a three-day race from Auckland to Queenstown with only $10.</p>
<p>In 2007, Malvindar was one of 100 young candidates selected from New Zealand and Australia to attend the National Aspiring Leaders’ Forum in Parliament as a promising young New Zealander.</p>
<p>Malvindar was awarded a University of Auckland Doctoral Scholarship in 2010 to embark on her PhD journey at the CBR under her supervisors Associate Professor Henry Waldvogel and the Director of the Centre, (and previous recipient of the New Zealander of the Year), Distinguished Professor Richard Faull).</p>
<p>Her doctoral project focused on Huntington’s disease - a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder without a current cure. She became involved in all aspects of trying to help those with the disease, not only the “scientific side.”</p>
<p>For the past five years, Malvindar has organised bi-annual fundraising drives, and spearheaded a social media campaign for the Auckland Huntington’s Disease Association to win a car.</p>
<p>Malvindar also promotes brain health awareness among young people, visiting several primary, intermediate and secondary schools in the wider Auckland region over the past five years as a volunteer to promote the importance of “looking after your brain.”</p>
<p>Malvindar is also very committed to bringing her scientific research into the local and global community. She has presented her research in several parts of the world, including Boston, Massachusetts and in Rio de Janeiro at the World Congress of Huntington’s Disease in 2013.</p>
<p>In May 2013, Malvindar presented her research at the National Huntington’s disease Association Conference as a guest speaker. After consultation with HD families at this conference, Malvindar decided to form the Huntington’s Disease Youth Organisation of New Zealand (HDYO-NZ), a charity dedicated to provide support to the youth of NZ impacted by HD.</p>
<p>She is the co-chairperson of HDYO-NZ and since 2014, has actively organised fundraising and Huntington disease awareness promotions - from bake sales to running a “Givealittle” page, and hosting a screening of the documentary “The Inheritance” - raising $5000 for a website to support, educate and advocate for young New Zealanders impacted by Huntington’s disease.</p>
<p>Due to her passion and commitment to the Huntington’s disease community, she was elected in 2015 as one of the new board members of the Huntington’s Disease Association Auckland Committee, evaluating scientific literature relating to Huntington’s disease and representing HDYO-NZ’s voice on the board.
