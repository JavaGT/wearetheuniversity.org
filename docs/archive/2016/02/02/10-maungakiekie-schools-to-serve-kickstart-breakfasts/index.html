<p>10 Maungakiekie schools to serve KickStart Breakfasts this term</p>
<p>As the school year begins again, MP Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga is pleased 10 schools in the Maungakiekie region are serving KickStart Breakfasts.</p>
<p>“Breakfast prepares kids for learning so it’s important all children start the day with a full stomach.</p>
<p>“These schools offer the KickStart Breakfast programme, ensuring their students have a bowl of Weet-bix and milk before the school day starts.</p>
<p>“The majority of parents in our region do a superb job, but we want to make sure all young Kiwis have the chance to make the most of their schooling,” says MP Mr Lotu-Iiga.</p>
<p>The KickStart Breakfast programme is a partnership between Government, Sanitarium, Fonterra and the community. In 2013 the Government provided $9.5 million over five years to expand the programme from 2 to 5 mornings per week and to any school that wants or needs it, regardless of decile.</p>
<p>“This week the six millionth KickStart Breakfast was served, showing the success of the programme not just here in the Maungakiekie but nationwide.</p>
<p>“Thanks to KickStart students are healthier, better behaved, and more focused, with 99.5 per cent of schools satisfied or very satisfied with the Kickstart Breakfast programme,” says MP Mr Lotu-Iiga</p>
