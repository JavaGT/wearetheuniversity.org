<p>Hutt Valley locals awarded Toloa Scholarship</p>
<p>National List MP based in Hutt South Chris Bishop has congratulated Zoe So’otago and Melissa Kupa, both of Lower Hutt, on each winning a Toloa Scholarship.</p>
<p>The scholarship, worth $25,000 over three years, is directly aimed to encourage more Pacific students into science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects.</p>
<p>“Zoe and Melissa should be proud of this wonderful achievement,” Mr Bishop said.</p>
<p>“There was a high level of interest in this year’s Toloa Scholarships, and the calibre of applicants was equally impressive.</p>
<p>“New Zealand needs high-achieving STEM students like Zoe and Melissa to move up the ranks and take their places as our future industry leaders and problem solvers.</p>
<p>“I wish both Zoe and Melissa all the best for future endeavours and studies,” Mr Bishop said.</p>
<p>Four Toloa Scholarships were awarded nationwide. Open to first-year undergraduate and postgraduate Pacific students studying STEM-related papers, the scholarships ensure recipients also receive mentoring and an industry internship.</p>
