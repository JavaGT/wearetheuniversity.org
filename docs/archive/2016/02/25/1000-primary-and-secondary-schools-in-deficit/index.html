<p>Education Spokesperson<br>25 February 2016 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>1000 primary and secondary schools in deficit</strong></p>
<p>Almost 1000 schools – or 40 per cent – of New Zealand’s state and integrated primary and secondary schools are in deficit, Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>Figures obtained by Labour show that in 2014 there were 994 schools which posted a deficit. Many of those deficits were higher than $100,000 and one school’s was more than $1 million.</p>
<p>“This data also shows that 12 schools were in debt and eight of these were low decile.</p>
<p>“It is a shocking state of affairs that so many schools are running at a loss. There have already been <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11564002">concerns</a>this means students are missing out on outdoor programmes, library books and technology.</p>
<p>“National’s underfunding of schools is putting more and more financial strain on them. The less money schools get from the Government, the more they have to rely on so-called ‘voluntary’ donations.</p>
<p>“These figures will be particularly galling for those parents whose children are sitting in leaking mouldy classrooms while the Ministry rehouses itself in flash new offices in Wellington featuring a $2.6 million staircase,” Chris Hipkins says.</p>
