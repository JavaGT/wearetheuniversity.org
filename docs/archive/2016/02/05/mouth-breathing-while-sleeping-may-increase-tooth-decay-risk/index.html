<p><strong>Mouth breathing while sleeping may increase tooth decay risk</strong></p>
<p>Mouth breathing during sleep is linked to a more acidic oral environment that may promote tooth enamel erosion and caries, new University of Otago research suggests.</p>
<p>Dentistry researchers from the University’s Sir John Walsh Research Institute studied the oral pH levels of 10 healthy volunteers who alternated between sleeping with and without a nose clip that forced them to breathe through their mouths.</p>
<p>Their study’s findings, published in the <em>Journal of Oral Rehabilitation</em>, showed that the average pH during sleep with forced mouth breathing was a mildly acidic 6.6 compared to a neutral 7 when nose breathing.</p>
<p>Study lead author and PhD student Joanne Choi says the research team found a noticeable difference in the pattern of variation of pH and temperature between day and night.</p>
<p>“Intraoral pH decreased slowly over the hours of sleep in all participants, but showed greater falls over a longer period of time when participants were forced to mouth breathe,” Ms Choi says.</p>
<p>At times the pH levels fell as low as 3.6 during forced mouth breathing during sleep, well below the critical threshold of 5.5 when enamel starts to demineralise, she says.</p>
<p>“This study is the first to continuously monitor intraoral pH changes in healthy individuals over several days. Our findings support the idea that mouth breathing may indeed be a causal factor for dental diseases such as enamel erosion and caries.”</p>
<p>The study was funded by the Dentsply Research Foundation and Maurice and Phyllis Paykel Trust project grants.</p>
