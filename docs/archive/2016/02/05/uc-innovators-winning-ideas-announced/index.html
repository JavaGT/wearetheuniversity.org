<p><strong>UC Innovators winning ideas announced</strong></p>
<p>The University of Canterbury Innovators’ Summer Start-Up Programme has culminated in the top ten teams presenting their projects to a panel of judges, coinciding with the official opening of the UC Centre for Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>The 2015/16 summer programme saw 33 students working on 31 ventures including for-profit, charitable and social enterprises, spanning across health, engineering, clothing, food and agriculture industries.</p>
<p>At the official opening of the UC Centre for Entrepreneurship, instead of a traditional ribbon-cutting ceremony, the students were challenged to come up with something innovative in a 24-hour challenge. They designed and built a clever illuminated sign with three Edison bulbs representing the centre’s main components for success: the community, UC and the students.</p>
<p>The UC Centre for Entrepreneurship Operations Director, Dr Rachel Wright says that the sign also worked metaphorically. “Without all three elements in place, the centre would not light up. We need all three for the centre to reach its potential and to light up the world with ideas.”</p>
<p>Dr Wright says that the judges – entrepreneurs and business leaders Peter Montgomery, Ben Kepes, Michelle Sharp, Geoff Brash and Kevin Park - had a difficult time deciding on the winners, with a very close decision.</p>
<p>The spectators, including members of the local business community who helped mentor, intern and encourage the students, have been impressed with the calibre of the ventures created by the UC Innovators, says Dr Wright.</p>

<p>“It was a great event with so many comments about the quality of the presentations from people who were blown away by the talent of the students and how great their ideas were.”</p>
