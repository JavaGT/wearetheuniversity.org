<p>Sadness over death of Māori leader</p>
<p>The death of Linda Grennell, a former President of the Māori Women’s Welfare League, marks the end of a lifetime of leadership and service to New Zealand, and Labour sends sympathy to her family at this very sad time, Labour Women’s Issues spokesperson, Ruth Dyson says.</p>
<p>“Linda, of Te Runanga o Koukourarata, served as President of the Māori Women’s Welfare League from 2005 – 2008 and was appointed a member of the Whanau Ora Taskforce.</p>
<p>“She had a courageous battle with cancer for many years but even during that difficult time, continued to work for better opportunities for all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“Linda was a member of the 2005 Māori ‘granny’s’ team that walked the New York marathon, championing exercise and a healthier lifestyle for Māori women.</p>
<p>“She has contributed much to the understanding of the history of Māori in Canterbury, recognising traditional arts and crafts, and fostering pride in Māori culture. Linda was both a friend and colleague, and her death is a huge loss to New Zealand,” Ruth Dyson says.</p>
