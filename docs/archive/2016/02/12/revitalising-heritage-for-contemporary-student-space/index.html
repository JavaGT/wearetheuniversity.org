<p>Revitalising heritage for contemporary student space  </p>
<p>Students have a new space to call their own with the completion of a dedicated, fit-for-purpose student venue at Lincoln University’s Te Waihora campus.</p>
<p>Lincoln University Students Association (LUSA) President Aimee Kingsbury says “The Workshop”, as the new development is called, is a perfect reflection of Lincoln students and the relaxed, social way they operate.</p>
<p>“It’s an outstanding, much-needed addition to the University. It is multifunctional, including kitchen facilities, meeting rooms, a relaxed lounge and a number of different eating, sitting and entertainment areas. This diversity means the space has the ability to cater for all students, both domestic and international.”</p>
<p>The 540m² building was officially opened with a karakia and whakatau by Te Mairiki Williams, followed by a waiata. University staff had the opportunity to view the new facility, their last chance before students arrive on campus and The Workshop becomes a dedicated student space.</p>
<p>Lincworks Property Manager Chris Stevens says ideas for a new student focussed space to replace the Union Building were investigated during 2014. “After much discussion the preferred option was a refurbishment of the old arts workshop.”</p>
<p>It has taken five months to get the workshop stripped out, remediated and refurbished. The thinking behind the design was to develop a 21st century, well serviced, fit-for-purpose student space that had designed-in utility and diversity across multiple spaces utilising a contemporary aesthetic that also respected the heritage of the building.</p>

<p>“The architecture of The Workshop and how it sits on Farm Road reflects an almost forgotten piece of Lincoln University’s field research heritage. The opportunity to reinvent and revitalise the building by creating a vibrant, contemporary fit-for-purpose student centric space within its existing unloved shell has been extremely rewarding for everyone involved,” said Mr Stevens.</p>
<p>University Chancellor Tom Lambie thanked former LUSA President Kahlia Fryer for her pivotal role in making the idea a reality, saying she was driven to improve the student experience.</p>
<p>Former Lincworks staff member Emma McCormick was also thanked for her role in recognising the potential of the building. “The thing I like the best about it,” says Mr Stevens, “is how the University has actively chosen to revitalise a neglected and unloved work-a-day shed, successfully turning it into a contemporary 21st century student-centric space.”</p>
