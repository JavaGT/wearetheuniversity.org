<p>Super Bowl Screens Live on Free-to-Air TV But Not Kiwi Sports</p>
<p>While the American Super Bowl screens live on TVNZ it’s disappointing there are no signs the state broadcaster will be showing our national sports live anytime soon, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“Fans of Super Bowl will be jumping with glee with the coverage but just how many are there in New Zealand?,” says Spokesperson for Sport and Recreation Clayton Mitchell.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see sport from around the world but let’s get our priorities right and start with live, free-to-air Kiwi sports and significant events that Kiwis love to follow.</p>
<p>“TVNZ has confirmed there is an appetite for free sports broadcasts saying there has been ‘resounding viewer response to the return of free-to-air sport’ since it started a pop-up channel.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First wants a fair go for Kiwi sports fans as in Australia and the UK where the law requires significant sports occasions to be broadcast live and free to air.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First has a bill awaiting introduction to Parliament to amend the Broadcasting Act to require free live coverage of significant sports events. The government should come to the party on behalf of the thousands of Kiwis who cannot afford pay TV.”</p>
