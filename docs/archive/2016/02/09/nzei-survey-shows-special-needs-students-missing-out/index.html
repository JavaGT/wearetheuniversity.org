<p><strong>NZEI survey shows special needs students missing out on support</strong></p>
<p><strong>9 February 2016</strong></p>
<p>NZEI TE Riu Roa is warning that thousands of children will be missing out on equal access to quality education this year because of a lack of resourcing for students with special education needs.</p>
<p>The institute has just published its survey of Special Education Needs Co-ordinators (SENCOs) in schools.</p>
<p>The survey revealed that around 16 percent of students were on schools’ special needs registers, but nearly 90 percent of schools’ special needs coordinators did not believe there was adequate support for students and their learning.</p>
<p>“Special Needs Co-ordinators (SENCOs) play a key role in schools by ensuring students and their families get the learning and emotional support they need,” says NZEI National President Louise Green.</p>
<p>“But it is a role that is often made more difficult because, in most cases, a shortage of resources means it is often an extra or “add-on” task for a senior staff member – normally on top of their other duties such as classroom teacher, deputy principal or principal.</p>
<p>“Two-thirds of SENCOs in our survey said they did not have enough time to fulfil this role adequately. This is made more difficult because of the complex funding system schools and families face when seeking support for children’s learning needs.</p>
<p>“SENCOs are the professionals working closest to the children and their families. Proper recognition of their essential role in ensuring kids can equitably access learning is critical if the education system is to be truly inclusive.</p>

<p>“Properly funding time and professional development for the SENCO role would ensure the government made some real progress towards meeting its goal of inclusion for all children.”</p>
<p>Louise Green says the survey will help inform NZEI’s ongoing work around special education in schools and the wider community.</p>
<p>The survey was sent to approximately 800 SENCOs from all over the country and had a response rate of 44 percent.</p>
