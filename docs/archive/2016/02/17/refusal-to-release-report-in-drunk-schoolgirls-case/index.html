<p><strong>Wednesday, 17 February 2016, 9:31 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Authority Refuses to Release Report in ‘Drunk Schoolgirls’ Case</p>
<p>Secrecy still surrounds a case involving degrading acts on young women despite an investigation into police conduct, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“It’s appalling that the Independent Police Conduct Authority has refused to produce a public report on police actions in a case in which girls were apparently deliberately intoxicated by young males and lewd photographs posted online,” says Spokesperson for Women Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“The authority is hiding the investigation behind a ‘secrecy provision’ in the legislation it works under.</p>
<p>“It says the investigation by police was robust and thorough – if so, then the authority should reveal just how it was done. They could do this and protect the identity of those involved.</p>
<p>“The authority should inform the public and explain why no charges were laid and why the male students were only given a warning.</p>
<p>“We are led to suspect that this could have been a case of unconscious bias in which the police put blame on the young women,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
<p>New Zealand First has a member’s bill, the Crimes (Covert Intimate Filming of Incapacitated Persons) Amendment Bill, that will close a loophole in legislation around such cases.</p>
