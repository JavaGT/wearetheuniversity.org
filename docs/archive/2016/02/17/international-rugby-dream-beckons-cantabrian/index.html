<p><strong>Wednesday, 17 February 2016, 2:13 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>Former University of Canterbury student Tumama Tu’ulua is on the cusp of fulfilling an international rugby dream after an invitation to play for the Samoa A rugby squad.</p>
<p>Just days before a planned move to Nelson to pursue his rugby ambitions, Tu’ulua received the call, and instead is training in the Pacific heat under the watchful eye of Manu Samoa coach and former All Black Alama Ieremia.</p>
<p>It’s been a whirlwind few weeks for Christchurch-born Tu’ulua, whose parents are from Samoa. He has been combining study with working for the Pacific Development Team at the University of Canterbury for the past five years.<br>His current focus is a game against the Melbourne Rebels tomorrow (Thursday, 17 Feb), after which the final A squad – Tama Samoa 15 – will be selected for the 2016 World Rugby Pacific Challenge held in Fiji in March.</p>
<p>“I’m feeling optimistic, but I know that I still have a lot of work to put in,” says Tu’ulua.</p>
<p>Tu’ulua says training in Samoa’s summer heat has been a shock to the system.</p>
<p>“The hardest thing to cope with is the humidity. The lungs take a while to adjust to it. The only way to cope with it is to drink a lot of water, wear a hat, and just keep moving even when your mind is telling you to stop.”</p>
<p>Tu’ulua, who plays lock, says it’s the toughest training he’s experienced.</p>
<p>“Just standing in the sun in Samoa is enough for most people but training in it is a different beast. Last Friday we went to the other side of the island and trained at the beach. We did boxing, running, then a 12-exercise circuit, more running, then the circuit again – followed by another round of both and a tug of war. After we did the circuit the first time I was so tired I genuinely thought we were finished – I was wrong.”</p>

<p>Currently based in Siusega, 5km west of Apia, Tu’ulua is just down the road from the Samoa Rugby Union facilities where the squad trains.</p>
<p>“I’m quite blessed in that sense because some boys live on the other side of the island and have to be up at 4am to make it to training every day.”<br>Tu’ulua has already had a taste of international rugby, representing Samoa at the Under-20 World Cup in South Africa in 2011. He says playing New Zealand in their opening game is his greatest rugby moment so far.</p>
<p>“Standing there listening to the New Zealand national anthem then the Samoan one, then being challenged by the Haka and performing the Siva Tau was pretty special.”</p>
<p>Belonging to both countries is something he relishes. “As I&#39;ve gotten older I’ve been trying to connect more with my Samoan heritage. Seeing where my parents have come from to where they are now in New Zealand is very humbling and I hope to try emulate that work ethic in my training.”</p>
<p>As a proud Cantabrian, Tu’ulua embraced his time as President of the Canterbury University Samoan Students’ Association (CUSSA).</p>
<p>“I spent a big chunk of my life in the dark about most aspects of my culture but coming to university and joining CUSSA made a big difference in filling in the gaps. I just love how a small country from the South Pacific has made a huge impact internationally in so many different fields and I can proudly say that I&#39;m from there.”</p>
<p>Last year CUSSA hosted So’otaga in Christchurch, the country’s biggest ever gathering of university Samoan student associations from across New Zealand for a week of sporting, academic and cultural competitions.</p>
<p>“So’otaga was a big highlight for me. A lot of sweat and tears from a lot of different people went into it and I’m so happy that we managed to pull it off.”</p>
<p>The event also allowed him to show off his performing skills – winning an award for his Samoan cultural performance, and later winning ‘Show MVP’ at the University of Canterbury Students’ Association’s annual MADCAPS Performing Arts awards.</p>
<p>He credits a short stint with the Northland ITM squad as a replacement lock last season as reigniting his passion for pursuing a career in professional rugby.</p>
<p>But he is also full of praise of the role played by two of his coaches at the Sydenham Rugby Club in Christchurch, where he has played since finishing school at Lincoln High.</p>
<p>“Sidney Tauamiti and Dale McLeod were part of the Sydenham Club when I first started and they were the two who made me realise that I could make something out of rugby. From there I started making age group rep teams and was lucky enough to be put in to the Canterbury pre-academy group.”</p>
<p>“My ultimate goal is to play rugby professionally, to be in a position where I can support myself and my family. Playing for Manu Samoa would be a dream come true, too.”</p>
<p>While it’s currently on hold, he plans to return to complete his Bachelor of Commerce (majoring in Management) at the University of Canterbury.</p>
<p>“I&#39;m pretty close to finishing and my parents would be happy to see me receive that degree.”</p>
