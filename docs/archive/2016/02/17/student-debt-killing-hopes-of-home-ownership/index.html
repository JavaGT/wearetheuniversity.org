<p>Student debt killing hopes of home ownership  </p>
<p>New analysis shows the home ownership rate among Kiwis under 40 has plummeted since student loans were introduced, putting long-term financial security at risk and shutting a generation of New Zealanders out of the Kiwi dream, Andrew Little says.</p>
<p>“Three quarters of New Zealanders under 40 now don’t own a home, many of whom have given up on ever buying a house as they continue to pay down loans well into their mid-life.</p>
<p>“Before student loans were introduced the home ownership rate for under 40s was at 57%. Now it’s just 25%, meaning hundreds of thousands of Kiwis are missing out on the long-term financial security of owning their own home.</p>
<p>“Next month total student debt will reach $15 billion, a burden which is strangling the future of our young people and which will have a serious impact on New Zealand’s economic future.</p>
<p>“Yet John Key’s government continues to insist that student debt has no effect. These housing figures prove just how out of touch the Prime Minister is.</p>
<p>“Investing in free post-school education is an investment in New Zealand’s economy. Denying generations of Kiwis the opportunity to buy a home, raise a family and retire in comfort is a legacy no Government should be proud of,” Andrew Little says.</p>
