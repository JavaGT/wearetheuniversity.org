<p><strong>Congratulations to Jarrod Gilbert on the fourth reprint of <em>Patched: The History of Gangs in New Zealand</em></strong></p>
<p>We are excited to announce that the fourth reprint of <em>Patched</em> is now available. <em>Patched</em> is one of AUP’s strongest backlist titles and has now sold over 10,000 copies – or as Jarrod puts it, ‘if you stack all of the copies up they&#39;d be as high as the Sky Tower’. This book, which won the People&#39;s Choice Award at the 2013 New Zealand Post Book Awards, continues to be as relevant as ever and Jarrod maintains a lively media presence.</p>
<p>Press Director Sam Elworthy comments: ‘Congratulations to Jarrod for writing a PhD thesis that has become a major New Zealand bestseller and a classic in the field. It was built out of years of field research, it will be the definitive book on gangs for years to come, and we’re proud to publish it.’</p>
<p>Read an excerpt from the book here. Please note that some of the content on pages 40–41 may not be suitable for all readers.</p>
<p><em>Patched</em> is available from all good bookstores throughout New Zealand, and is distributed by Potton and Burton.</p>
