<p><strong>Allied Staff at Waiariki Institute of Technology to hold urgent vote on strike action.</strong></p>
<p>Allied staff at Waiariki Institute of Technology voted unanimously at today’s stopwork meeting to reject the bargaining position adopted by Waiariki and, have instructed their union, TIASA, to hold an urgent vote on strike action.</p>
<p>TIASA members are seeking a $900 (with a minimum of 1.3%) flat rate increase to salaries and an extension of coverage to all allied staff.</p>
<p>“Staff are frustrated that not only are Waiariki refusing to agree to the modest and affordable increase that members are seeking but, they are steadfastly refusing to extend coverage of the collective agreement to their staff at Waiariki’s Holiday Park, who are their lowest paid and most vulnerable staff” said TIASA’s Chief Executive, Peter Joseph. “This is viewed as particularly important given the impending merger of Waiariki with Bay of Plenty Polytechnic and the uncertainty that this has created with all staff” he said.</p>
<p>“TIASA have given Waiariki an assurance that collective agreement coverage for staff at the Holiday Park would protect the Parks operational needs and affordability but, they are steadfastly refusing to consider this approach and are instead, proposing a separate agreement” said Joseph. “Given Waiariki’s stance to date, a separate agreement for Holiday Park staff would not be in their best interests”.</p>
<p>“Staff are reluctant to take action that may affect students but feel that Waiariki’s stance leaves them no option. Waiariki can settle this before students are impacted in any way” said Joseph.</p>
