<p><strong>South Waikato students welcomed to Uni through new initiative</strong></p>
<p>New university students from South Waikato have been officially welcomed into the University of Waikato’s Te Ara ki Angitū: Pathways to Excellence programme – designed to make university more accessible.</p>
<p>More than 60 people including students, family members and programme partners from Tokoroa and Putaruru attended the official launch on Tuesday night, held at the South Waikato Sports and Events Centre.</p>
<p>Established last year, the programme aims to give prospective students access to direct bus transport from Tokoroa and Putaruru to the University of Waikato, access to learning devices, learning hubs established in partnering schools, support and mentoring, and an opportunity to apply for a fees scholarship.</p>
<p>The initiative was developed following discussions between University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley and the high school principals of Tokoroa High School, Forest View, Putaruru College and Te Wharekura o Te Kaokaoroa o Pātatere to improve access to university for Year 13 students.</p>
<p>“We want students who have the potential and the aspiration to attend university to also have access to the opportunity that makes it a realistic and viable option. This requires positive collaboration between the university, the schools, families and the communities,” says Professor Quigley.</p>
<p>The South Waikato community has given high support to the university’s initiative, and organisations and local iwi have come on board, with Ngāti Raukawa, Mighty River Power and ANZ backing the programme.</p>
<p>Students on the programme will arrive on campus next week for orientation, using the new bus service.</p>
