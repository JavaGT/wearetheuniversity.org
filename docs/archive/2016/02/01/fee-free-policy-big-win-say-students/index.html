<p><strong>Fee Free Policy Big Win say Students</strong></p>
<p>The national students’ organisation says yesterday’s announcement by Labour Party leader Andrew Little that a Labour government would provide three years of free post-school education is a big win for all New Zealanders, young and old.</p>
<p>The proposal would ease the enormous financial burden associated with post-school study and would encourage more New Zealanders to further their learning, regardless of their age.</p>
<p>President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations, Linsey Higgins, welcomes Labour’s announcement, saying focus by political parties on the plight of post-school students is long overdue.</p>
<p>“The cost to learners of tertiary education has been ignored for too long, and the Labour Party’s announcement changes that, putting it back at the centre of discussion. This announcement finally addresses what we have been saying about barriers to entry and debt levels on graduation. It will considerably reduce the burden on future post-school students, for all of those undertaking apprenticeships, higher education, and other approved training programmes,” says Ms Higgins.</p>
<p>“If implemented, this policy has the ability to make a significant difference to the tertiary landscape. I come from a small rural community, and there are some brilliant people from my years there now in low earning jobs - who didn’t study at a tertiary level because of the cost. This policy would have changed their lives.”</p>
<p>This policy also acknowledges the importance of lifelong learning and the changing face of tertiary students.</p>

<p>“We hear from business groups who are crying out for skilled workers. Giving people the ability to upskill throughout their life will address this gap in the labour market.”</p>
<p>“As student debt will surpass $15 billion later this month, and student numbers plummet dramatically, we need a national conversation on how we can address the ballooning debt while ensuring New Zealand is prepared for radically changing economy.”</p>
<p>NZUSA warned that the announcement is not end of what they are expecting from a Labour-led government.</p>
<p>“Mr Little’s speech is not the end of the discussion on supporting post-school students. Living costs and borrowing to live remain important focuses for us. We also expect to work closely with Mr Little’s office on the details of his announcement to ensure the policy’s maximum effectiveness.”</p>
