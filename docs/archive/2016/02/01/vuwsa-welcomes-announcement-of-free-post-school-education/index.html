<p><strong>VUWSA welcomes announcement of free post-school education</strong></p>
<p>The Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) welcomes the announcement of free post-school education by the Leader of the Opposition, Andrew Little, yesterday.</p>
<p>Since the massive hike in fees in 1990, Victoria students have condemned the annual rise in tuition fees to no avail.</p>
<p>VUWSA President, Jonathan Gee, says that Labour’s policy announcement puts the costs of tertiary education back on the agenda.</p>
<p>‘As student debt reaches $15 billion this year, I’m glad that we’re finally having a national conversation on the value of tertiary education to society.</p>
<p>This puts tertiary education firmly on the agenda for the 2017 General Election; and I’m looking forward to seeing further wins for the tertiary education sector from other political parties.’</p>
<p>A skilled workforce will help all New Zealanders achieve a sustainable step-change in economic growth, equity, and higher living standards.</p>
<p>‘Free tertiary education doesn’t just benefit young New Zealanders, but all who wish to be better educated in the spirit of lifelong learning. Free tertiary education will open doors for those who would have shied away from university,’ says Gee.</p>
<p>Current tertiary students won’t receive the benefits of free post-school education since the proposed policy won’t kick in until 2019.</p>
<p>‘There’s still a lot of work to do to reduce the debt of those who have racked up tens of thousands in student loans over the last 20-odd years.</p>
<p>However, the proposed policy is definitely a step in the right direction.’</p>
