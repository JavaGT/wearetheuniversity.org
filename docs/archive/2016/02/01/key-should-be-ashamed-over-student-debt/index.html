<p><strong>Key should be ashamed over student debt</strong></p>
<p>John Key should be ashamed for overseeing a 50 per cent blowout in student loan debt on his watch, says Labour Leader Andrew Little.</p>
<p>“Student loan debt has risen from less than $10 billion in 2008 to $15 billion today. That’s mostly driven up by the 37 per cent increase in tertiary fees under National, while government tuition funding has risen just 3 per cent.</p>
<p>“Saddling young people with student debt has prevented many from taking up study, made it harder to save and contributed to a home ownership rate among under-40s of just 20 per cent.</p>
<p>“Education is a source of wealth - for the individual and for the country. It helps lift families out of poverty, create opportunities for our children and provides the skilled workforce our businesses need.</p>
<p>“By giving people the opportunity to retrain or study without being saddled with a debt mountain will make it far easier for New Zealanders to make it in the world.</p>
<p>“National’s true attitude to post-school education has been revealed by Steven Joyce’s claim that Labour’s plan to bring in three free years ‘achieves absolutely nothing’.</p>
<p>“Average debts of $20,000 are a big disincentive for struggling families. That’s why student numbers have fallen by 20 per cent under National.</p>
<p>&quot;John Key&#39;s Government has saddled a generation with debt that makes it harder for them to achieve the Kiwi Dream. He should be ashamed,” says Andrew Little.</p>
