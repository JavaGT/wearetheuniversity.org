<p><strong>Special pathway leads to success</strong></p>
<p>Anna Yu Dong is one of the first graduates from a special collaborative 3+1+1 pathway devised by Lincoln University and the New Zealand College of Business (NZCB).</p>
<p>The pathway enables people from partnered institutes with three year bachelor’s degree-equivalent qualifications to get subject-specific preparation for one year in a NZCB’s Level 7 Diploma in Business Administration, and then seamlessly integrate into a Lincoln one-year-master’s degree specialised in agribusiness and commerce professions — hence ‘3+1+1’.</p>
<p>After three years study at Chengdu Institute Sichuan International Studies University (CISISU) in China, at bachelor’s degree level, Anna flew to Christchurch and completed her L7 Diploma at NZCB and then recently finished her year of intensive study to receive a Master of Business in Global Management and Marketing at Lincoln.</p>
<p>She is now working in Christchurch.</p>
<p>Lincoln’s Business Development Manager, Dr Samuel Yu, says Lincoln welcomes more approaches from businesses and industry to “partner in creative ways to showcase NZ Inc. and solve problems”.</p>
<p>“Working in this type of public-private partnership enables Lincoln to offer a unique point of difference in a globally competitive market,” he adds.</p>
<p>NZCB Director Liz Zhou says the College has a collaborative relationship with CISISU in China where Anna originally studied.</p>
<p>“We are able to offer this unique opportunity to study at a specialist institute like Lincoln on this special pathway.”</p>

<p>“Anna was a top student achieving A+ scores from some of her subjects and gaining scholarships from both NZCB and Lincoln University during her master’s degree.<br>“We want to help students learn and gain a tertiary qualification to transition them into their dream jobs and careers. This pathway also helps to address the skills-shortage gaps that exist in China and here in the Canterbury region too” says Mrs Zhou.</p>
<p>“As only seven per cent of international students coming to New Zealand study in the Canterbury region, compared to Auckland’s seventy-two per cent, we are delighted that we were able to help graduates such as Anna to move into a career, such as in financial services, where she is now working for a bank in Riccarton,” Mrs Zhou added.</p>
