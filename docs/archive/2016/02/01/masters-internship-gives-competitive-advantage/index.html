<p>Master’s internship gives competitive advantage</p>
<p>University of Canterbury (UC) student Meenal Pathak is already making a difference to cancer treatment times through her Master of Business Management (MBM) experience.</p>
<p>As part of UC’s intensive MBM programme, Pathak undertook an 18-week internship with the Canterbury District Health Board (CDHB).</p>
<p>She says the opportunity to work on the Faster Cancer Treatment project – a review of how patients with a high suspicion of gynaecological cancer are triaged – has been the highlight of her study.</p>
<p>“Getting practical experience is so valuable. I’m learning so many things about building relationships in New Zealand’s work environment that you couldn’t learn in a classroom,” Pathak says.</p>
<p>With a wealth of experience in dentistry and hospital management, Pathak already had a successful career in India.</p>
<p>However, she wanted to expand her understanding of management to other aspects of the healthcare industry on a global level.</p>
<p>She says the MBM at UC appealed because it centres on applied learning.</p>
<p>“I wanted a qualification that would give me a global view and international experience so that I could gain a competitive advantage,” she says.</p>
<p>Strong partnerships between UC’s internationally accredited Executive Development Programmes and key employers such as the CDHB offer students individualised opportunities to gain hands-on experience, while making a difference within local businesses and the community.</p>
<p>CDHB learning and development advisor Jacqui Benter-Lynch says that internships benefit the CDHB, the University and students.</p>

<p>“The Canterbury DHB-UC partnership provides enormous value. The opportunity to apply current thinking and theories in the workplace environment is crucial to maintaining a high-performing health system and interns play an important role in this,” she says.</p>
<p>Pathak says that her UC Master’s has been a fantastic introduction to studying and working in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The internship, collaborative method of learning and the focus on group work and presentation skills will be beneficial to me as I further my career,” she says.</p>
<p>Pathak says that she feels well-prepared to take her next step. She is pursuing a management role in the New Zealand healthcare industry and would like to study towards a PhD further down the track.</p>
