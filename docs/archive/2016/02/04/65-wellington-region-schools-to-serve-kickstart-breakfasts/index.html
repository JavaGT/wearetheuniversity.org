<p>Media statement</p>

<p>65 Wellington Region schools to serve KickStart Breakfasts this term</p>
<p>As the school year begins again, MP Paul Foster-Bell MP is pleased 65 schools in the Wellington region are serving KickStart Breakfasts.</p>
<p>“Breakfast prepares kids for learning so it’s important all children start the day with a full stomach.</p>
<p>“These schools offer the KickStart Breakfast programme, ensuring their students have a bowl of Weet-bix and milk before the school day starts.</p>
<p>“The majority of parents in our region do a superb job, but we want to make sure all young Kiwis have the chance to make the most of their schooling,” says MP Foster-Bell</p>
<p>The KickStart Breakfast programme is a partnership between Government, Sanitarium, Fonterra and the community. In 2013 the Government provided $9.5 million over five years to expand the programme from 2 to 5 mornings per week and to any school that wants or needs it, regardless of decile.</p>
<p>“Since the Government expanded the programme to 65 more schools in the Wellington region have started serving KickStart Breakfasts.</p>
<p>“This week the six millionth KickStart Breakfast was served, showing the success of the programme not just here in Wellington, but nationwide.</p>
<p>“Thanks to KickStart students are healthier, better behaved, and more focused, with 99.5 per cent of schools satisfied or very satisfied with the Kickstart Breakfast programme,” says MP Foster-Bell.</p>
