<p>24 February 2016</p>
<p>Professor Tom Bishop has been thinking about, acting in and studying Shakespeare since his high school days. Now the University of Auckland English professor has made a long academic career out of his love of the Bard’s work.</p>
<p>His first encounter with Shakespeare’s compelling theatrical power was Peter Brook’s famous staging of <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>, which he saw at the age of 12 when its world tour arrived in Melbourne.</p>
<p>He will be sharing his expertise at a special two-hour seminar inside the recently built Pop-up Globe.</p>
<p>The Pop-up Globe has been built in central Auckland to mark the 400th anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare and to host a season of some of his best known plays throughout February and March.</p>
<p>The Pop-up Globe is the first ever full-scale temporary working replica of the second Globe theatre to be built.</p>
<p>Tom’s seminar, Shakespeare on Stage: Performance and Posterity Inside the Globe Theatre, will provide a unique insight into the world of Shakespeare and his plays.</p>
<p>The first half of this session will explore the extraordinary structure of the Globe and what it tells us about the way Shakespeare’s plays work. A group of actors will then join the second half of the session and perform some scene demonstrations including some scratch scenes using cue-scripts improvised by members of the audience.</p>
<p>Tom says having the Pop-Up Globe in Auckland has been an asset to the public and scholars alike.</p>
<p>“Working on this year’s AUSA Summer Shakespeare production of <em>The Tempest</em> —at the Pop-Up Globe from March 1 to March 13 — has been an invaluable opportunity to explore a theatre space approximating an early English stage.&quot;</p>
<p>Tom is the author of <em>Shakespeare and the Theatre of Wonder</em> (Cambridge, 1996), the translator of Ovid’s <em>Amores</em> (Carcanet, 2003), and the co-editor of the annual <em>Shakespearean International Yearbook</em>. He is currently working on a book on Shakespeare’s Theatre Games.</p>
<p>The seminar is on Thursday March 10, 10am – 12pm. You can register <a href="http://www.lifelonglearning.co.nz/shakespeare-on-stage-performance-and-posterity-inside-the-globe-theatre/">here.</a></p>
