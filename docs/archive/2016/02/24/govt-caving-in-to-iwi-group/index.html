<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters<br>New Zealand First Leader<br>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>24 FEBRUARY 2016</p>
<p>Govt Caving in to Iwi Group</p>
<p>The government is caving into a huge shopping list from the Freshwater Iwi Leaders’ Group over the new Resource Management Act bill, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament, Rt Hon Winston Peters.<br>“Minister for the Environment Nick Smith speaks with a forked tongue for while he assures farmers, businesses and homeowners that he has their back, both he and the prime minister are caving in,” Mr Peters said in a speech in Auckland to Agcarm, a national organisation representing plant and animal science industries.</p>
<p>“The shopping list from the freshwater iwi groups includes all Crown-owned river and lakebeds and the water column; title in freshwater consistent with Waitangi Tribunal rulings; a $1 billion fund in to an iwi-approved entity to address capacity and capability.</p>
<p>“National has already altered the RMA to make iwi consenting authorities.</p>
<p>“The Joint Management Agreement between Ngati Porou and Gisborne District Council means that within five years, Ngati Porou will become a full consenting authority.</p>
<p>“Just last week Ngāi Tahu got two guaranteed representatives on Environment Canterbury when it returns to partial democracy later this year.</p>
<p>“In response to National’s alarming summersault New Zealand First will formally invite the prime minister to discuss real RMA reform that will include landowner compensation if councils continue to restrict property rights under the RMA.</p>
<p>“Only then will New Zealand First put its 12 votes behind the reforms that Minister Amy Adams advanced in 2013, minus the separatism,” Mr Peters said.</p>
