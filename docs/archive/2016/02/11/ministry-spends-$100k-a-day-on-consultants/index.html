<p>Fingers in Pies as Ministry spends $100K a day on consultants</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education forked out a whopping $100,000 a day on consultants and contractors last year – eight times more since National came to office in 2008, Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>“The Ministry appears to be throwing money at consultants so fast it often doesn’t even bother to use government rules for tendering.</p>
<p>“On at least 14 occasions in the past year the Ministry awarded contracts worth over $50,000 to unnamed individuals by using exemptions to procurement rules to avoid tendering the contracts.</p>
<p>“Tender rules exist to ensure taxpayers get the best value for money. However, the Education Ministry seems to think these rules shouldn’t apply to them.</p>
<p>“Ironically one of the contracts that was tendered was awarded to a company formerly called Fingers in Pies.</p>
<p>“This spending – at a time when core public service numbers are capped – will be hard for the public to swallow.</p>
<p>“Especially coming hard on the heels of the Ministry’s lavish new $20 million offices – which include a $2.6 million staircase – while students sit in leaking and mouldy classrooms around the country,” Chris Hipkins says.</p>
