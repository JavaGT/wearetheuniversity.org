<p>UC leadership training adopted by Wynyard Group</p>
<p>International software company Wynyard Group is sending more of its staff members to the University of Canterbury this year, after seeing the benefits of UC’s leadership training.</p>
<p>The Postgraduate Certificate in Strategic Leadership is designed for experienced managers who are interested in further developing their leadership capabilities.</p>
<p>Comprising six courses drawn from the UC MBA core curriculum, it is taught in a modular format on Fridays and Saturdays, enabling participants to still work full-time.</p>
<p>Basil Buwalda, engineering programme director at Wynyard Group, was one of several senior managers from Wynyard Group who completed the certificate in 2015.</p>
<p>The six courses provide practical, evidence-based tools and frameworks that focus on building on existing capabilities in managerial leadership and strategy.</p>
<p>Buwalda says Wynyard Group will be sending more employees to UC in the future.</p>
<p>“We started taking the courses to give ourselves a shared vocabulary and systems for our work.</p>
<p>“But as we implemented what we were being taught, we found our team’s collective decision making improved. Engineering teams have also adopted new methods of team formation.</p>
<p>“We’ve been happy with the results and in 2016 we will not just have senior managers but also team managers on some of the Executive Development Programmes’ courses.”</p>
<p>Buwalda says one colleague told him they really enjoyed the interpersonal skills training, saying it helped him understand how other people work. Another colleague found the teaching about team management really helpful.</p>
<p>Buwalda will be completing his MBA at UC, after finding the Postgraduate Certificate in Strategic Leadership so beneficial.</p>
