<p>$9 Million for Thorndon School redevelopment an exciting start to Term One</p>
<p>List MP Paul Foster-Bell welcomes this morning’s announcement by Associate Minister for Education, Hon Nikki Kaye, of $9 million for the redevelopment of Thorndon School. “This is a fantastic opportunity for Thorndon School to benefit from additional space and modern, innovative learning environments which will help both students and staff alike,” says Paul Foster-Bell MP.</p>
<p>Reconfiguring the 11 classrooms into 13 new innovative learning spaces, an administration block, and a new library, will provide an open-plan environment for both teaching flexibility and recreational use.</p>
<p>“The announcement by the Minister brings the total spending by this government on school redevelopment within the Wellington Region to almost $100 million since November, with another Wellington Central school, Kelburn Normal, receiving $8.5 million for redevelopment. This is great news for the future of the school, students, and staff,” says Paul Foster-Bell.</p>
