<p>OECD report shows huge impact of poverty on education</p>
<p>11 February 2016</p>
<p>A new report from the OECD has again highlighted the negative effects of poverty, showing that disadvantaged children in New Zealand are more than six times more likely to underachieve in maths than children from wealthier homes.</p>
<p>The report looked at PISA results of 15-year-olds in 64 countries and found that the disadvantages of poverty are compounded by a lack of early childhood education or coming from a single-parent family.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa President Louise Green said the report was yet more evidence poverty has a massive impact on children’s ability to learn.</p>
<p>“We should be putting our efforts into pulling children and their families out of poverty so they can achieve their true potential, but this government is clearly not serious about lifting educational system success while it pursues policies that breed poverty and inequality,” she said.</p>
<p>“Many of our underprivileged children come from homes where one or both parents are employed, but the minimum wage is not enough to live on and provide the necessities of life. When a child is poorly housed, fed and clothed, their health suffers, their dreams slowly shrink and it’s no wonder that school can be a struggle.</p>
<p>“The report said that, worldwide, socio-economic status was ‘probably the most important risk factor associated with low academic performance’. It makes sense to focus on reducing that risk factor. Introduction of the Living Wage of $19.25 would have a positive effect for many children and their families,” said Ms Green.</p>
