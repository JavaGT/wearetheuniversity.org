<p><strong>Future of education, jobs and economy</strong></p>
<p>Understanding the global economic forces that determine whether a tertiary degree will result in a job – let alone a well-paid one – is the theme of visiting British educational economist Professor Hugh Lauder’s lecture series in New Zealand this month.</p>
<p>His public talks on the relationship between education and the economy explore the question: “Are we in need of a radical re-think about education and its role in our economic and social lives?”</p>
<p>Professor Lauder, a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at Massey University and Auckland University of Technology, is the author and co-author of several books on the topic, including <em>The Global Auction: The Broken Promises of Education, Jobs and Incomes</em> (Oxford University Press, 2011).</p>
<p>He was quoted in the British press recently saying the British government should pay minimum wages to graduates saddled with hefty debts and encourage them to be more entrepreneurial.</p>
<p>Three lectures will be held in Palmerston North, Wellington and Auckland, and have been organised by Massey University’s Institute of Education, Auckland University of Technology and The Policy Observatory.</p>
<p>He will also address academics at Massey University’s Manawatū campus on Tuesday, 9 February, in a seminar titled: <em>The Vexed Relationship between Education and the Economy – and what can be done about it.</em> This seminar, also delivered in Wellington the following week, will explore the fundamental tensions in this relationship prompted by the demise of the dominant theory of the education-economy relationship: Human Capital Theory.</p>
