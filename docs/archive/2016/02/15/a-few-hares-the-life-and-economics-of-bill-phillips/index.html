<p><strong>A Few Hares: The Life and Economics of Bill Phillips</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alan Bollard</strong></p>
<p><strong>The story of an extraordinary New Zealander with a beautiful mind, a famous curve and a revolutionary computing machine.</strong></p>
<p>‘Bill Phillips was an inventor, an adventurer, a hero and a relentlessly original thinker. He was the Indiana Jones of economics and Alan Bollard has written a definitive biography.’ – Tim Harford, author of <em>The Undercover Economist</em> and <em>The Undercover Economist Strikes Back</em></p>
<p>How did an electrician from New Zealand with a few mediocre grades in sociology write the second most cited economics article in the world, build the MONIAC – a revolutionary computing machine – and quickly rise to become one of the world’s leading economists? From a remote Dannevirke farm to wartime POW camps to London’s intellectual world, the Bill Phillips story is a true New Zealand tale of adventurous spirit and can-do energy.</p>
<p>The Bill Phillips story is in the tradition of great New Zealanders such as Ernest Rutherford and Bert Munro. As many as a dozen Nobel laureates have owed some sort of debt to Bill Phillips and has ground-breaking work.</p>
<p>Bill Phillips combined his knowledge of electrical engineering with an interest in economics to build a world-first hydraulic-driven economics computing machine (the MONIAC). The working MONIAC is now on display at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Alan Bollard met Bill Phillips as a young graduate student and he helped to rebuild the MONIAC.</p>
