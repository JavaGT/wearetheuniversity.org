<p><strong>Recipe for Dirty Water</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand’s rivers and lakes should be swimmable and central Government needs to hurry up to enable it, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>The National Government’s ‘Next steps for fresh water’ consultation document was released today and is calling for public submissions.</p>
<p>“Measures announced are a recipe for more dirty water, and a disappointment to many around the country who want swimmable rivers,” Green Party water spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said today.</p>
<p>“If the water standard continues to be ‘wadable and boatable’, then our rivers will continue to deteriorate.</p>
<p>“There needs to be a national moratorium on further dairy conversions to protect areas such as Waikato lakes and rivers and Mackenzie Basin, and reduce fresh water pollution.</p>
<p>“The Green Party would make swimmable rivers the national standard and set rules that are clear and achieve the improvements that are so desperately needed.</p>
<p>“The consultation document may sound like a step forward but it is in a context of weak overall standards which do nothing to protect the birth right of our children to swim in clean water, let alone the restoration of our native fish species.</p>
<p>“The touted Irrigation Acceleration Fund is not helping the country’s waterways, and is instead leading to further dairy conversions. This is not helping the country’s waterways.</p>
<p>“Allowing such a long time lag for the fencing of all stock out of waterways shows which side this Government is on. Our waterways can’t wait until 2030 to have protection.</p>
<p>“The proposed fines are only useful if actually enforced, and what confidence can we have that fines will be issued?</p>
<p>“The Government has also failed to recognise Te Tiriti o Waitangi and has relegated iwi and hapu rights as a ‘right to have a say’.</p>
<p>“These freshwater announcements are an opportunity lost. Clean water is not a ‘nice to have’ but an essential of life,” Ms Delahunty said.</p>
