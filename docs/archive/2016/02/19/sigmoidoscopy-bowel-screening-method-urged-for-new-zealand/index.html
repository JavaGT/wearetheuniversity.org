<p><strong>Sigmoidoscopy bowel-screening method urged for New Zealand</strong></p>
<p><strong>Friday 12 February 2016</strong></p>
<p>An effective national bowel screening programme involving a single test, a sigmoidoscopy, could be introduced in New Zealand within 12 months.</p>
<p>In an Editorial in the <em>New Zealand Medical Journal</em> today, The University of Otago’s Associate Professor Brian Cox, from the Hugh Adam Cancer Epidemiology Unit, describes how this could be achieved.</p>
<p>“This would involve a single test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, just once at about 60 years of age,” he says.</p>
<p>“There is very strong evidence this would reduce a person&#39;s risk of dying of bowel cancer by 43% and reduce their risk of future development of bowel cancer by 33%. This is much greater protection from bowel cancer than the proposed programme of the Ministry of Health.&quot;</p>
<p>He adds that the Ministry of Health’s dogged pursuit of bowel screening based on two-yearly testing for blood in the faeces is “letting the public down”.</p>
<p>“Despite all the evidence over the past 6 years, they have not even trialled screening by flexible sigmoidoscopy.</p>
<p>&quot;The testing of faeces for blood is designed to detect existing bowel cancers only and not preventing the disease, whereas pre-invasive polyps can be seen and removed at examination by flexible sigmoidoscopy,” he writes.</p>
<p>In addition, the load on gastroenterology services is much lower with one-off flexible sigmoidoscopy and, due to the reduction in the incidence of bowel cancer achieved, results in a much more economical screening programme.</p>

<p>“It seems very odd that, despite being a better screening test that would produce a much more economical screening programme, the Government continues to support the approach of two-yearly faecal occult blood testing.</p>
<p>&quot;The continuing delay in the introduction of once-in-a-lifetime flexible sigmoidoscopy screening is worrying. Why should a general practitioner continue to be denied the opportunity to refer their patients for a 20-minute screening test that offers the best protection from bowel cancer for their patients?&quot;</p>
