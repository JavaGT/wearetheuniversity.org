<p><strong>Botched EQC repair numbers keep rising</strong></p>
<p>The numbers of Cantabrians needing fix up jobs done on their shoddy EQC repairs is still rising and is now well above government forecasts, says Labour’s Canterbury spokesperson Megan Woods.</p>
<p>“EQC has previously said it expected 116 remediation repair requests a week, but new data released to Labour shows it has ballooned out to an average of 145 a week.</p>
<p>“At this rate of complaints, there will be an extra thousand Cantabrians needing fix up work by the end of March.</p>
<p>“These numbers only cover people who make a complaint – there could be thousands more who have just paid to get the repair work done privately or who haven’t yet realised they need it.</p>
<p>“Gerry Brownlee loves to claim it’s all hunky dory at EQC, but here is another blow out in the numbers of shoddy repairs needing to be redone. This is only going to create more stress and worry for people who have been through so much. It’s clear there is a real mess at EQC.</p>
<p>“With over a thousand new claims resulting from the Valentine’s Day earthquake, we need a full and independent enquiry into EQC to make sure this mess is fixed up and people can move on with their lives,” says Megan Woods.</p>
