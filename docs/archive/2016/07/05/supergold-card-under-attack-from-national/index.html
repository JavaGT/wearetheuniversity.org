<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters<br>New Zealand First Leader<br>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>5 JULY 2016</p>
<p>Supergold Card under Attack From National</p>
<p>The government insisting SuperGold Cardholders have to buy smartcards to travel free on public transport at off-peak times is a move towards undermining the value of the card, New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters said when accepting a Grey Power petition at Parliament today.</p>
<p>“It is unfair and wrong that after seniors have paid a lifetime of taxes, this government wants to chip away and ultimately destroy what the SuperGold Card is all about.</p>
<p>“By capping funding to councils for seniors’ free off-peak travel, it will be only a matter of time before the councils and transport operators say the scheme is too expensive.</p>
<p>“That is why this petition started at Tauranga Grey Power is so important – it tells the government not to mess with the SuperGold Card and to ensure adequate funding is made available for seniors to travel free on public transportation during off-peak periods.</p>
<p>“Free off-peak travel has added to the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of seniors, helping them to remain active and engaged in their communities; it must be maintained,” Mr Peters said.  </p>
<p>The petition states:<br>“We the undersigned, respectfully request that the House of Representatives examine the capped bulk funding model to ensure SuperGold Card free off-peak public transport scheme is adequately funded and appropriately resourced by central government”.</p>
