<p><strong>Massey launches te reo for business resource</strong></p>
<p>Massey University is urging businesses to include te reo in their business practices. Dr Farah Rangikoepa Palmer (Waikato/Ngāti Maniapoto) heads Massey’s Te Au Rangahau, Māori Business &amp; Leadership Centre and says including te reo is a vital way for companies to connect with the uniqueness of Māori culture in Aotearoa.</p>
<p>“Acknowledging indigenous languages and culture demonstrates cultural intelligence, and anything that makes you stand out from the crowd in an ever-increasing global world makes good business sense.”</p>
<p>Te Au Rangahau has produced a simple pocket-sized fold-out card that people can download and print. It covers everything from how to open a meeting, to simple greetings and business terms.</p>
<p>There are even motivational sayings such as Karawhiua! – Give it heaps, Ki te hoe – Let’s get down to work and Tūwhitia te hopo – Overcome the fear.</p>
<p>The card also includes ways to start an email such as Tenā koe, as well as a sample email signature. They were created by former Massey senior Māori adviser Jacob Tapiata, in partnership with the Māori Language Advisory Group at Massey.</p>
<p>Dr Palmer says the cards were given out at a recent Matariki Māori business event in Palmerston North and the reaction was very positive.</p>
<p>“I think business people want to engage with the language but are often too busy to work out how. This card is something they can keep handy and slip into daily use – hopefully not just during Māori language week but throughout the year.”</p>
<p>Dr Palmer says as the Māori economy grows, businesses wanting to engage with Māori can benefit from making a genuine effort to try and incorporate te reo into everyday business practices.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t take much to sign off an email with Ngā mihi, to learn a greeting or to acknowledge local iwi, hapū and tangata whenua. Māori appreciate the effort and who knows what doors it might open.” says Dr Palmer.</p>
<p>The Te Reo for Business Card can be found on the Massey University web site here.</p>
