<p><strong>Conference focuses on law’s future role</strong></p>
<p>From “generation rent” to artificial intelligence, robotics and driverless cars, experts from around the world will tomorrow converge at Victoria University of Wellington to grapple with topical and challenging legal issues.</p>
<p>The Australasian Law Teachers Association (ALTA) Conference 2016 brings together 130 lawyers from Australasia and beyond to debate the theme <em>Advancing Better Government, Sustainable Economies, Vibrant Communities: Law’s Role?</em></p>
<p>The three-day conference will be opened in the Beehive tomorrow and the audience will hear from world-renowned experts from Canada, the Pacific Islands, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Many issues have a legal component. So it is essential that we get together to explore the role law teachers and scholars should play in forming the next generation of graduates, practitioners, government officials and civil society advisers,” Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Law Mark Hickford says.</p>
<p>“As a capital city university, Victoria University has a mandate that sets us apart as a leader in advancing better government. This conference is one of the ways we can deliver on that mandate.”</p>
<p>More than 30 panel sessions will gather together academics and practitioners to explore challenging topics and present cutting-edge research, including:</p>
<p>• Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Autonomous Vehicles—equipping lawyers for a fast-changing world</p>
<p>• Machine Learning and the Future of Law</p>

<p>During the conference, Life Membership of ALTA will be granted to Sir Geoffrey Palmer QC and Chief Justice Dame Sian Elias in a presentation by the Honorary Secretary of ALTA, Emeritus Professor David Barker AM (Member of the Order of Australia).</p>
<p>“Life membership is granted to those who have given distinguished service to ALTA or to legal education,” Professor Barker says.</p>
<p>“Sir Geoffrey Palmer, who is a Distinguished Fellow at Victoria University of Wellington’s Faculty of Law, has not only been Prime Minister of New Zealand, he has also served as Attorney-General and Minister of Justice. He has both practised and taught law and has a long association with ALTA.</p>
<p>“Dame Sian Elias is a prominent member of the New Zealand judiciary who has supported the aims and objectives of ALTA and has attended and spoken at conferences, including this 2016 event.”</p>
