<p><strong>Tuesday, 26 July 2016, 1:09 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Little<br>Leader of the Opposition</strong> MEDIA STATEMENT  </p>
<p>26 July 2016</p>
<p><strong>Major reform of careers and apprenticeships to meet Future of Work</strong></p>
<p>The next Labour Government will transform careers advice in high schools to ensure every student has a personalised career plan, Leader of the Opposition Andrew Little says.</p>
<p>“Today I am announcing the next Labour Government will commit to a major boost to careers advice to ensure the next generation is prepared for the future of work.</p>
<p>“Labour’s plan will professionalise careers advice and integrate it into learning. Every school will have highly trained, skilled careers advice staff. Every student will develop a personalised career plan.</p>
<p>“As the world of work changes, careers advice can no longer be seen as an add-on, delivered by already overstretched teaching staff.</p>
<p>“Our $30 million plan will partner schools with business and training providers to deliver up-to-date and relevant careers advice that prepares our young people for the future.</p>
<p>“The next Labour Government will also help even more young people into apprenticeships. Labour will make taking on apprentices a condition of winning major government projects, and of participating in the KiwiBuild programme.</p>
<p>“This is in addition to Labour’s Dole for Apprenticeships scheme, which subsidises employers to take on apprentices using the money they would otherwise receive as a benefit, as well as our commitment to three years’ free post-school education and training.</p>

<p>“There are now 87,200 young New Zealanders not in employment, education or training. That cannot go on. We have seen through our Future of Work Commission that in the rapidly changing world of work young New Zealanders need to develop a wide range of skills and attributes that will serve them well throughout their working lives.</p>
<p>“Labour’s plan will ensure every young New Zealander has the best shot at a great working life,” says Andrew Little.</p>
