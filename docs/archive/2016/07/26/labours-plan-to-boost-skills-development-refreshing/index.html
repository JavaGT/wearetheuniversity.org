<p>Labour&#39;s plan to boost skills development refreshing</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> CTU</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The future of work needs to be one where working people have good, satisfying jobs with decent incomes, and Labour&#39;s announcements today on boosting skills are welcome, the CTU said today.</p>
<p>Andrew Little today announced that a Labour-led government would ensure all schools have dedicated careers advisory staff, and that major government procurement projects would have apprenticeship requirements.</p>
<p>&quot;Both of these moves are sensible and much needed. Improving access to skills and career development is a tangible way to improve the lives of working Kiwis&quot;, CTU Secretary Sam Huggard said.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently, not all secondary students have access to careers advisors. Students and their parents will welcome the move to ensure this is available to everyone.&quot;</p>
<p>Sam Huggard said that Government has significant purchasing power through its procurement, and significant reform was needed in this area to better support local jobs and industries.</p>
<p>&quot;Working people in union have been calling for apprenticeship requirements for some time - this needs to be part of the government procurement mix, alongside beefed up whole-of-life economic analysis and Australian-style Industry Participation Plans.&quot;</p>
