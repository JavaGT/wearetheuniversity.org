<p>MEDIA STATEMENT  </p>

<p>Housing map a hit as crisis spreads across NZ</p>
<p>More than 55,000 New Zealanders have used Labour’s interactive housing map in its first week to see how the housing crisis is affecting their local community, Labour Housing spokesperson Phil Twyford says.</p>
<p>“Our innovative <a href="http://www.labour.org.nz/housingmap">map</a> shows the housing crisis is a nation-wide problem; a fact supported by the daily stories of rocketing house prices, out of control rents, and homelessness from across the country.</p>
<p>“It allows people to enter their address and see information down to suburb level on house prices, homeownership, rents, and more.</p>
<p>“Interest in the map has been strongest in Auckland, but is also particularly high in Hamilton, Tauranga, and Northland as well as Wellington and Christchurch, reflecting the spread of the housing crisis.</p>
<p>“The alarm bells on the housing crisis are reaching a crescendo, and Kiwis are clearly worried. Meanwhile National continues to act like a possum in the headlights, unable to come up with any practical and long-term solutions.</p>
<p>“Only Labour has a comprehensive plan to restore the Kiwi dream of owning your own home and make sure everyone has a decent place to live.</p>
<p>“We’ll build 100,000 affordable homes for families to buy, free up land, ban foreign speculators, build thousands of state houses, and require every rental to be warm, dry, and healthy”, says Phil Twyford.</p>
