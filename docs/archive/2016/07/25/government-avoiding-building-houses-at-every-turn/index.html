<p>Government avoiding building houses at every turn</p>
<p>The National Government needs to just build more homes, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Herald is <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11680555">today reporting</a> that the Government’s target for social housing providers to build 1000 new homes has been completely missed, with community housing providers saying they have only proposed a maximum of 239 new social housing places.</p>
<p>“This is what happens when we have a Government that at every turn is opposed to actually building houses,” said Green Party Social Housing Spokesperson Marama Davidson.</p>
<p>“Community housing providers are run on the smell of an oily rag, and expecting them to build the thousands of homes we need right now and into the future just isn’t realistic.</p>
<p>“The National Government’s handling of the housing crisis is a mess, and our most vulnerable people are bearing the brunt of that incompetence.</p>
<p>“The families that are sleeping in cars and garages right now need the Government to stop its ideological nonsense and build more houses.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/policy/fairer-society/homes-not-cars">Our Homes not Cars policy</a> would prioritise the building of hundreds of state homes to help deal with the emergency housing crisis facing thousands of vulnerable New Zealanders,” said Ms Davidson.</p>
