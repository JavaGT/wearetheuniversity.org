<p><strong>Wednesday, 27 July 2016, 11:52 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris Hipkins</strong><br><strong>MP for Rimutaka</strong><br><strong>Shadow Leader of the House</strong><br>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>27 July 2016</p>
<p><strong>Questions for (Oral) Answer- Wednesday 27th of July</strong></p>
<p>While Parliament might be in recess, there are still plenty of things that Ministers need to answer for. So the Labour team has put together six of the best questions that the Government should be answering today (plus a special bonus question), Labour’s Shadow Leader of the House Chris Hipkins said.</p>
<p>QUESTION TO MINISTERS</p>
<p>1. <strong>ANDREW LITTLE</strong> to the <strong>Prime Minister</strong>: Is he satisfied that all young New Zealanders attending secondary school are getting the best advice to make good decisions about their future studies, if not, why after 8 years in government hasn’t the National Party done anything to increase or improve career guidance in schools?</p>
<p>2. <strong>ANNETTE KING</strong> to the <strong>Minister of Health</strong>: Why did it take Medsafe seven years to communicate to district health boards the risks around vaginal mesh implants and what comfort will this explanation give to women who cannot access a specialist to remove them?</p>
<p>3. <strong>GRANT ROBERTSON</strong> to the <strong>Minister of Finance</strong>: Is it correct that the OECD-FAO dairy price forecast for 2018 that he relied on in Budget 2016 has been revised down from US$3400 a tonne to US$2617 a tonne, and if so what advice has he received on the impact of this on the $40 billion of dairy debt held by NZ banks?</p>

<p>4. <strong>PHIL TWYFORD</strong> to <strong>Minister for Building and Housing</strong>: Why, after 3 years of promising solutions to the housing crisis, does he think that now is a bad time for first home buyers to try to buy in Auckland or does he agree with the ANZ Bank, the Reserve Bank, economist Arthur Grimes, and EMA chief executive Kim Campbell that his response to the housing crisis is completely inadequate?</p>
<p>5. <strong>SUE MORONEY</strong> to the <strong>Minister for Transport</strong>: When was he first informed about the alleged fraud of several hundred thousand dollars from the Ministry of Transport and what did he do about it?</p>
<p>6. <strong>JENNY SALESA</strong> to the <strong>Minister for Skills, Training and Employment</strong>: Why should New Zealanders have confidence that the National Government has delivered the brighter future they were promised when the number of young people not in any form of education, training or employment has risen by 26,500 since National took office in 2008?</p>
<p><strong>BONUS QUESTION: CHRIS HIPKINS</strong> to <strong>Minister of Broadcasting</strong>: What reports has she received of consistent lures being placed on Pokemon Go stops outside the press gallery?</p>
