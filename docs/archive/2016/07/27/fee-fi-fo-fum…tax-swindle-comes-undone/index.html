<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>27 July 2016</p>
<p>Fee fi fo fum…tax swindle comes undone</p>
<p>At the same time the Government is looking to pump more cash into private schools the IRD is investigating several over a tax swindle which allows parents to falsely claim private school fees as donations and claim a rebate, Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>“Inland Revenue warned against this practice – where fees paid to private education providers or the charitable trust that owns them are being incorrectly categorised as gifts or donations - two years ago.</p>
<p>“While it appears there has been little actual follow up action since that then, other than a couple of individual taxpayer investigations, new documents we’ve received under the OIA reveal IRD is now looking into discrepancies at several private schools or childcare centres.</p>
<p>“The information shows payments - which a childcare centre or school would otherwise have to recover from parents by way of attendance or tuition fees - are being used to meet the running costs.</p>
<p>“That’s a rort in anyone’s language.</p>
<p>“And it comes on the back of revelations the IRD is holding at least $15 million of unclaimed rebates owed to parents of students at state schools who have forked out some $48 million-plus in voluntary donations.</p>
<p>“So parents of children at public schools aren’t claiming tax back, while parents of children at private schools are doing just that, despite it being unlawful.</p>

<p>“What’s more Hekia Parata has confirmed private schools are in line to receive a bigger share of taxpayers&#39; money.</p>
<p>“Labour’s priorities are clear – we will ease the financial burden parents sending their kids to state schools face by making sure those schools are properly funded.</p>
<p>“Unlike National, we will seek to create equal opportunities through education, not keep tilting the playing field in favour of the wealthy,” Chris Hipkins says.<br>ends</p>
