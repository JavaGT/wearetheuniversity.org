<p>New Zealand Young Labour</p>
<p><strong>Making Sanitary Products Accessible to Students</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand Young Labour was pleased to be a part of the launch of the Foodbanks project to make sanitary items available to students who cannot afford them along with Countdown, the Salvation Army and Manuwera MP and Labour Youth Affairs spokesperson Louisa Wall.</p>
<p>Sanitary products are an expensive but often over looked necessity. Most students are already running on tight budgets and having to pay for sanitary products can stretch this beyond its limit. This new project will be a significant help to students struggling to make ends meet. Said Holly Wallbank, Young Labour Women’s Organiser.</p>
<p>Making sanitary products more affordable is a Young Labour policy priority and Young Labour President Nevada Lee-Mariu brought it to the attention of Louisa Wall. Lee-Mariu spoke about the sacrifices that students have to make to afford sanitary products and this is having negative on their education and health.</p>
<p>Female sanitary products are essential healthcare items, yet there are young women in New Zealand who stay home for one week every month because they can’t afford these products. This should not be happening anywhere in the world and certainly should not be happening in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Young Labour will continue to work within and outside the party to make sanitary products more accessible and affordable for those who need it.</p>
<p>ENDS.</p>
