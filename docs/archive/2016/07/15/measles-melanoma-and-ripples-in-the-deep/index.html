<p><strong>Measles, melanoma and ripples in the deep</strong></p>
<p>From how the universe began to how our immune systems can be used to treat cancer, two researchers at Victoria University of Wellington will this month discuss their work at the forefront of scientific research and discovery.</p>
<p>In the first talk Dr Bridget Stocker will delve into vaccines—a subject she says receives mixed reactions among the New Zealand public.</p>
<p>“It’s interesting that there’s both strong support and strong suspicion of vaccines. Many people have lobbied for the Government to fund vaccines such as cancer-fighting Keytruda. However, at the same time we’re experiencing an outbreak of measles in schools around New Zealand because there are other people who don’t think vaccinating against those pathogens is a good idea.”</p>
<p>Dr Stocker will provide an overview of the science underpinning vaccine development and how vaccines are used to prevent infectious diseases or treat cancer.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Melanie Johnston-Hollitt will then discuss the detection of gravitational waves by researchers at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in February. She will discuss the 20-year LIGO project, Einstein’s theory of general relativity, and the implications for astronomy.</p>
<p>“The detection of gravitational waves is the discovery of this century. Until now, our understanding of the universe has been limited to what we can see with visible light, such as through radio telescopes. Now we have a totally new way to get information.”</p>

<p>The two lectures are part of the School of Chemical and Physical Sciences’ annual “Dangling Bonds” event, says conference organiser, senior lecturer Dr Justin Hodgkiss.</p>
<p>“In Chemistry and Physics when we talk about a dangling bond it means an atom that is missing a neighbour—another atom that it would connect or bond to. With this conference we hope to encourage more interaction and therefore more bonds, between researchers in these areas, and also with the public.”</p>
<p>The talks will be followed by interactive demonstrations about gravitational wave detection and “herd” immunity among populations.</p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> 5.30pm, Monday 25 July</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> Memorial Lecture Theatre, Kelburn Campus, Victoria University of Wellington</p>
<p><strong>RSVP:</strong> Before Friday 22 July at Eventbrite.co.nz, or by email <a href="mailto:atscps@vuw.ac.nz">atscps@vuw.ac.nz</a>.</p>
