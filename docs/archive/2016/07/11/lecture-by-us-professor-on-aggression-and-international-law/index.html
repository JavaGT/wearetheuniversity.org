<p><strong>Lecture by US Professor on aggression and international law</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What</em></strong>: A lecture by Rutgers University Professor Roger Clark on Making Aggression a Leadership Crime in 2017:The Rome Statute and the Kampala Amendment”, and response by the Hon Chris Finlayson</p>
<p><strong><em>Where:</em></strong> Beehive Theatre, Wellington</p>
<p><strong><em>When</em></strong>: 5.30pm, Monday 11th July 2016</p>
<p><strong><em>Who:</em></strong> Professor Roger Clark, Hon Chris Finlayson, hosted by Green MP Dr Kennedy Graham, Labour MP David Clark and National MP Mark Mitchell, and the New Zealand Centre for Global Studies and the International Law Association, New Zealand Branch.</p>
<p>Rutgers University Professor Roger Clark will be giving a talk on the International Criminal Court (ICC) at Parliament tonight, and will provide an overview of potential developments in the role of the ICC in coming years with the adoption of the Kampala Amendment.</p>
<p>The Attorney General, Hon Chris Finlayson, will give a response.</p>
<p>“The Kampala Amendment Conference in 2010 provided a breakthrough in the extension of the ICC’s jurisdictional reach. When the Kampala process is completed, it will enable prosecution of individual leaders, of states parties to the ICC, for acts of aggression – essentially any military action unauthorised by the UN Charter,” said Green MP Dr Kennedy Graham.</p>
<p>“Such a change will rank alongside the UN Charter itself, as an historic step forward in taming illegal military activity in our world.</p>
<p>“I look forward to hearing Professor Clark’s thoughts on where the Kampala process is at, and from the Attorney-General on where New Zealand currently stands on the matter,” said Dr Graham.</p>
<p>Public and media are both welcome, and the event is free. To RSVP please contact <a href="mailto:Poliana.Costa@parliament.govt.nz">Poliana.Costa@parliament.govt.nz</a>.</p>
