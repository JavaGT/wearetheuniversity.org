<p>Phil Twyford<br>MP for Te Atatū</p>
<p>Housing Spokesperson</p>
<p>MEDIA STATEMENT  </p>
<p>13 July 2016</p>
<p>Government must stop state house sell-off</p>
<p>The Government must immediately pull the plug on its planned sell-off of state houses in order to stop the housing crisis getting any worse, Labour’s Housing spokesperson Phil Twyford says.</p>
<p>“While Paula Bennett is putting people into transit camps in Auckland, and families are living in cars, it is madness to be flogging off thousands of state houses.</p>
<p>“National is in the process of selling <a href="http://www.treasury.govt.nz/statesector/socialhousing/tauranga-invercargill">1,100 state houses in Tauranga</a> to consortia dominated by merchant bankers and offshore companies. Their policy is to sell <a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/next-steps-social-housing">8,000 state homes by 2017</a>.</p>
<p>“Bill English is now promising to build more state houses, but he needs to be up-front and tell New Zealanders whether he is still going ahead with the sell-off.</p>
<p>“His promise of 5,000 new houses has little credibility when he only managed to build <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/81477396/Housing-NZ-shifted-goalposts-after-falling-short-on-state-homes-target-Labour-says">just over half of the 2,000 houses</a> he promised to deliver by the end of last year.</p>
<p>“English is so embarrassed by the performance of Joyce, Bennett and Smith in this ongoing fiasco he rushed out this announcement yesterday without even a press release. It didn’t even rise to the status of a Ministerial tweet.</p>

<p>“Targets for new building are irrelevant if National continues to sell off large numbers of state houses. It is the total number of houses available that counts – since 2011 National has run down the stock by 2600.</p>
<p>“National has allowed the housing crisis to spiral out of control, and now they are flailing around making policy on the hoof on a daily basis. Steven Joyce is tweeting $92 million budget announcements. Nick Smith is putting more money into homebuyer subsidies only a year after the policy was last updated because Auckland house prices have outstripped the thresholds.</p>
<p>“Paula Bennett putting people into transit camps in our country’s biggest city is a tragic indicator of how bad things have got under this Government.</p>
<p>“Instead of this frenetic poll-driven tinkering, National needs to commit to build 100,000 affordable homes, crack down on speculators, and call off its state-house sell off,” Phil Twyford says.</p>
