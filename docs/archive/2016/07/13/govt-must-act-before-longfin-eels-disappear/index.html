<p>Govt must act before longfin eels disappear</p>
<p>The Government must suspend the commercial catch of New Zealand&#39;s longfin eel, and accept the conclusion by Parliament&#39;s environment watchdog that the eel is on a path to extinction, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.pce.parliament.nz/media/1665/longfin-eels-south-island-tac-submission-final.pdf">her submission on the Government&#39;s catch limits for South Island eel fisheries</a>, the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment recommended that the commercial catch of longfin eels should be suspended until it is clear the species is recovering.</p>
<p>“The Government can take the simple step of suspending commercial fishing of native longfin eels, and ensure this unique creature has a shot at surviving,&quot; said Green Party environment spokesperson Eugenie Sage.</p>
<p>“Just as we stopped hunting and eating other threatened species such as kiwi and kakapo, we can stop commercial fishing of longfin eel.</p>
<p>“Fisheries Minister, Nathan Guy rejected the Commissioner’s recommendation back in 2013 to suspend the commercial catch of longfin eel, without presenting a compelling case for doing so. National is continuing to undermine its own goal to ‘improve the long-term sustainability of longfin eels’.</p>
<p>“Independent research by NIWA and the Parliamentary Commissioner three years ago showed that long finned eels were in a far more precarious position than the Ministry for Primary Industries claimed. The National government needs to act now to save the species.</p>

<p>“Under National, <a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/news/press-release/142-species-closer-extinction-due-doc-funding-cuts">142 species have moved closer to extinction</a>, including the kea, the Antipodes wandering albatross, and the fresh-footed shearwater.</p>
<p>“Longfin eels are truly remarkable creatures. They are unique to Aotearoa and endure a perilous migration of over a thousand kilometres just to breed. The least we can do is protect them,&quot; said Ms Sage.</p>
