<p>Report shows need for more equity funding for low decile schools</p>
<p>12 July 2016</p>
<p>Research reported today showing a two-year gap in achievement between students from low decile schools compared with those from higher decile schools shows the desperate need for better resourcing and support for schools in poorer areas.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa President Louise Green says teachers and principals are very concerned that the government’s funding review will mean less support for low decile schools at the very time that more support is desperately needed.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no increase in overall funding in this year&#39;s Budget and the government is signalling that the decile funding scheme is likely to be scrapped to be replaced by even more tightly targeted funding.</p>
<p>&quot;This means many more students will miss out on equity funding at a time when there is growing inequity.</p>
<p>“Instead of increasing funding for private schools and targeting equity funding to a smaller group of at-risk students, the government needs to put more resources into equity funding. It needs to do this without removing existing funding from school and early childhood education.</p>
