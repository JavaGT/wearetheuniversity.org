<p><strong>English denies dividend decision made - Joyce should delete his account</strong></p>
<p>National must explain who is right in the Housing NZ dividend debacle, after Bill English said no decision had been made on a payment for the next two years, in direct contrast to Steven Joyce, says Labour’s Finance spokesperson Grant Robertson.</p>
<p>“Mr English contradicted Steven Joyce <a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/audio/201807920/english-why-housing-nz-will-not-pay-govt-dividend">this morning</a> saying there has been ‘no formal decision yet’ on Housing NZ foregoing dividends for the next two years.</p>
<p>“This is in direct contrast to Mr Joyce’s tweet that the corporation was not paying a dividend for the next two years. His tweet was clearly a panicked response to Labour’s policy. Time for Bill English to tell Steven Joyce, ‘delete your account’.</p>
<p>“National is in disarray over housing. Mr English this morning said the discussion about the dividend has been going for a year; Mr Joyce claimed it had happened only over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>“This is the latest in a series of panicked responses, including mythical flying squads, $5000 ‘get-out-of-town’ grants that, yet again, the Finance Minister was out of the loop on, and finding $1b for infrastructure loans that wasn’t in the Budget.</p>
<p>“The reality is that National has taken over $664m out of Housing NZ in dividends since it’s been in government, at a time that waiting lists have gone up and nearly 3000 state houses have been sold. If National had wanted to fix up state housing they should have foregone a dividend years ago.</p>

<p>“While we welcome the apparent adoption of Labour’s no dividend policy, there is a lot more that needs to be done to fix the housing crisis.</p>
<p>“National should adopt all of our comprehensive housing policy, including stopping the state house sell-off, turning Housing NZ back into a not-for-profit public service and building thousands of state houses until demand is met.</p>
<p>“If not, they should get out of the way and let the party with the ideas take over,” says Grant Robertson.</p>
