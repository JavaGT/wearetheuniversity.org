<p><strong>Tuesday, 12 July 2016, 3:33 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Tracey Martin MP</p>
<p>Spokesperson for Education<br>12 JULY 2016  </p>
<p>Warning as Govt Moves to Dilute Teaching Standards</p>
<p>Teaching standards will drop as the government pushes the Charter Schools model into the state sector, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“It is happening with National’s Education Legislation Bill which sets up school positions for unqualified teachers,” says Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“The government is allowing its support partner’s Charter Schools philosophy to seep into state schools.</p>
<p>“Charter Schools, the ACT Party’s pet policy, can employ unqualified and unregistered teachers.</p>
<p>“Parents and teachers will rightly be alarmed that this will undermine standards. Schools under funding pressure will feel obliged to take on unqualified staff as a cost-cutting measure.</p>
<p>“This is totally different to student teachers having practical experience in schools and beginner teachers working in schools under a mentor.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First did not support the government on putting unqualified trainee teachers in charge of classes, which was added to the Bill at the last minute.</p>
<p>“But the Education and Science Select committee, controlled by National, ignored our opposition and public submissions against it.”</p>
