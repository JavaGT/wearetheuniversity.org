<p><strong>Thursday, 21 July 2016, 2:54 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Tracey Martin MP<br>Spokesperson for Education<br>21 JULY 2016</p>
<p>Say No to ‘Tick Box’ Education for Our Kids</p>
<p>New Zealand First reiterates its concerns that the National Government is going to use the Progress and Consistency Tool (PaCT) to &quot;standardise&quot; the professional judgement of teachers in light of a recently released Ministry of Education report.</p>
<p>“The National Government has been consistently working towards a narrow test-based education system.</p>
<p>“We believe they will use this latest report on the failure of their own National Standards policy to close the last loop hole.</p>
<p>“They will now justify making it compulsory for our teachers to use the PaCT tool which is as close as you can get to tick box education,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First has always argued that the standards are flawed not our teaching staff.</p>
<p>“We need to return to staged progressions within curriculum levels while at the same time collect nationwide school entry data.</p>
<p>“We should be providing equity funding for all students who need it to close the obvious opportunity gap that the government has created over the last decade.”</p>
