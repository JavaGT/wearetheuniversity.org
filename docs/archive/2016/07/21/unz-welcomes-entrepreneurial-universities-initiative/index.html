<p><strong>UNZ welcomes Entrepreneurial Universities initiative</strong></p>
<p>Universities New Zealand congratulates the Government and Minister Steven Joyce on today’s announcement of funding for Entrepreneurial Universities. The Government will provide $35 million over the next four years to partner with New Zealand universities in attracting leading international researchers to come and do their research in this country.</p>
<p>Professor Harlene Hayne, the Chair of Universities New Zealand and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Otago says, “The Entrepreneurial University initiative will be broadly welcomed by this country’s universities. We have a university system that is under significant financial pressure and that has been facing significantly greater pressure in both recruiting and retaining top quality researchers.”</p>
<p>“Half of all academic staff in New Zealand universities were recruited from overseas. In some cases, this has involved attracting bright young New Zealander’s back after completion of further studies. In other cases, this has been recruiting overseas academics whose international experience can significantly enhance knowledge when applied in a New Zealand context. In both cases, we are recruiting in an increasingly competitive international marketplace for skills.”</p>
<p>“This initiative will make a real difference in our ability to attract the best researchers to this country.”</p>
