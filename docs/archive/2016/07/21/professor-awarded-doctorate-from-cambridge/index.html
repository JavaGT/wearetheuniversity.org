<p>Professor Craig Elliffe from the Auckland Law School has been awarded a Doctorate from the University of Cambridge for his ‘significant contribution to scholarship.’</p>
<p>The announcement of his PhD follows an extensive submission of Craig’s work on the subject of international tax law and tax avoidance, including his recent book <em>International and Cross-Border Taxation in New Zealand,</em> alongside numerous journal articles.  </p>
<p>The international tax law specialist also undertook a question and answer oral examination in Cambridge by two leaders in the field.  </p>
<p>Craig’s examiners were Dr John Avery-Jones, a retired Judge of the Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery Chamber) and Peter Harris, a Professor in Tax Law at the Faculty of Law of the University of Cambridge, and Director of Studies and Fellow of Churchill College.</p>
<p>To be eligible for a doctorate from Cambridge the applicant must have a previous degree from the prestigious university. Craig had completed an LLM (Hons) at Cambridge shortly after finishing a conjoint BCom/LLB (Hons) at Otago.</p>
<p>To date Craig’s career includes being a partner at top firms KPMG, and then Chapman Trip, where he also served on both their boards, before being appointed the first Chair in Tax at the University of Auckland Business School.</p>
<p>He held that position for eight years before moving to the Auckland Law School as a Professor specialising in taxation, where he is also the Director of the MTaxS programme, the country’s leading postgraduate tax course.</p>
<p>His 2015 book <em>International and Cross-Border Taxation in New Zealand</em>, published by Thomson Reuters, went on to win the Legal Research Foundation’s JF Northey Memorial Book Award for the best law book published that year.  </p>
<p>Described by reviewers as ‘a book of formidable intellectual rigour’ and ‘comprehensive and well-written’, the Legal Research Foundation’s adjudicators called the book ‘outstanding.’  </p>
<p>Craig is planning to be capped at a ceremony in the United Kingdom early 2017, a date which will allow him to also attend a meeting of the International Fiscal Association (IFA).  </p>
<p>Established in 1938, the IFA is the only non-governmental and non-sectoral international organisation dealing with global fiscal matters. Craig is a member of its Permanent Scientific Committee, the first New Zealander to be selected.  </p>
