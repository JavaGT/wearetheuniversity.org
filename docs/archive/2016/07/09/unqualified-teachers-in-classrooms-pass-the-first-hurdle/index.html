<p><strong>Unqualified teachers in classrooms pass the first hurdle</strong></p>
<p><strong>8 July 2016</strong></p>
<p>Serious concerns about plans to put unqualified trainee teachers in sole charge of classes have been completely ignored in the report of the Education and Science Select Committee, released today.</p>
<p>The report’s only recommended change to the proposal was to instead call them “employment-based trainee teachers”.</p>
<p>The minority view of Labour, Green Party and NZ First echoed the concerns of the sector about the creation of the position.</p>
<p>Worryingly, their report noted that, “During subsequent discussions we had as a committee, officials advised us that no school would be forced to take on a trainee teacher position, but the legislation as proposed allows the Secretary for Education to designate such a position that would require a school board of trustees to appoint only an ‘employment-based trainee teacher’ to that position.”</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa President Louise Green said it was bad enough that such positions were being created to tempt schools that were struggling with inadequate funding or teacher supply, but to potentially force them to short change their students in such a way was appalling.</p>
<p>“What has happened to our education system that we are even thinking about lowering the quality of the teaching our children receive? What parent would want an unqualified trainee responsible for teaching their child?” she said.</p>
<p>Under the current system, beginner teachers who have already completed approved tertiary training are required to spend two years in a classroom with mentoring and induction programmes before they qualify for full certification.</p>
<p>Educators are also concerned about proposed changes to charter schools, which would enable tertiary education institutions to sponsor charter schools. This proposal, along with an amendment to allow charter school students to also receive tuition from public schools, is an admission that the experiment is failing.</p>
<p>“The government is keen to keep rolling out more charter schools, but clearly they’re struggling to find willing or able sponsors, while charter schools also seem incapable of delivering the full curriculum to their students,” said Ms Green.</p>
