<p>Greens to launch bold Wellington transport plan</p>
<p>Heavily discounted public transport fares, free Wi-Fi in all transport hubs in Wellington, electric bus and car fleets, and more central city and suburban green spaces will be at the top of the agenda if the Green Party’s Wellington local government candidates are re-elected.</p>
<p>The Green Party’s Wellington transport action plan will be launched at a public event on Tuesday 19 July, 6.30pm, at the Sustainability Trust on Forresters Lane, Te Aro, Wellington.</p>
<p>“Wellington&#39;s congestion won&#39;t be solved by a few expensive motorway projects. We need investment in fast, clean and affordable public transport, and we need Green councillors to make that happen,&quot; said Green Party transport spokesperson Julie Anne Genter MP.</p>
<p>Wellington Regional Councillor Paul Bruce said the Greens would introduce a 25 percent discount on buses off-peak; 50 percent full-fare [<em>corrected 20/7</em>] student discounts, and free bus transfers, in response to public concern about the cost of public transport.</p>
<p>Wellington Regional Councillor Sue Kedgley said replacing polluting, noisy diesel buses with modern electric buses within 10 years, as well as introducing light rail, would make the city centre more attractive for pedestrians and cyclists and increase bus patronage, which has plateaued for several years.</p>
<p>&quot;Having invested millions in upgrading our train services, we now need a similar level of investment in our bus services,” said Cr Kedgley.</p>

<p>Wellington City Councillor Sarah Free said all transport hubs in Wellington should be warm and sheltered and have free Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>“We will also bring on an electric revolution. With a fully electric bus fleet, light rail and more electric car charging stations, Wellington can be the electric vehicle capital of Australasia,” said Cr Free.</p>
<p>“Many policies so far announced by other candidates rely on outdated 20th century ways of thinking,” said Wellington City Councillor Iona Pannett.</p>
<p>“As global temperatures increase, we need more people walking, cycling and taking public transport and green spaces and less asphalt.</p>
<p>“Introducing 30km and 40km speed limits throughout the city will make it safer and easier to walk and cycle, especially for kids. We can afford all these initiatives if money is reallocated from the National Roads of Significance programme,” said Cr Pannett.</p>
