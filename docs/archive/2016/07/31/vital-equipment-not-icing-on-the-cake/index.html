<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>31 July 2016</p>
<p>Vital equipment, not icing on the cake</p>
<p>Hospitals are increasingly being forced to turn to fundraising to buy essential equipment as National’s cuts to health take their toll, Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“Right now we’ve got a charity organisation rattling the tins for a heli-pad for Canterbury DHB and Starship Hospital undertaking door-to-door collections.</p>
<p>“Capital and Coast District Health Board wouldn’t have had its new MRI scanner if it hadn’t been for the efforts of Wellington Hospitals Foundation.</p>
<p>“Yet here’s the rub, WHF is a charitable trust which raises money for, as it says ‘extra projects’ that are not funded by the Government.</p>
<p>“Demand for MRIs has risen 20 per cent across the region over five years. A new scanner, I suspect, was a necessity, not a nice to have.</p>
<p>“Ensuring our hospitals have the best facilities and equipment is fundamental to a quality healthcare system.</p>
<p>“To have patients and the public chipping in to help pay for vital medical gear is something we would expect to see in Third World countries, not 21st Century New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Still, when you have a National Government that has cut $1.7 billion from the health budget in the past six years, it’s no wonder our supposedly publically-funded DHBs are having to be propped up courtesy of cake stalls and coin trails,” Annette King says.  </p>
