<p>Convention centre decision offers security</p>
<p>The Government’s decision to downsize the Christchurch Convention Centre should not prevent the new facility from providing security to investors and a major boost to the South Island tourism industry, says Lincoln University tourism lecturer Dr Michael Shone.</p>
<p>“The convention centre is a good way for Christchurch to attract new types of visitors who will spend money in the city, and it shouldn’t matter that it’s been scaled back, as long as it’s built for purpose to accommodate the small-to-medium convention market.”</p>
<p>Dr Shone says the downsizing decision was “inevitable, as inflationary pressure means for every year it doesn’t get built, it becomes more expensive”.</p>
<p>“The Crown needs to be mindful about how it spends its money, and it will also have needed to look at where Christchurch fits in to New Zealand’s convention centre capacity, taking into account the Auckland and Queenstown facilities.”</p>
<p>He says the announcement that the facility will be finished in 2019 is “not before time”, with many key players “drumming their fingers, waiting for a decision”.</p>
<p>“The challenge now is to make sure that the 2019 date becomes a reality. There’s been a strong and positive signal from Government that this will happen. However, plenty in the sector will still be waiting until they see the structure rise out of the ground before they commit.</p>
<p>“But having a date gives accommodation and hospitality providers something to aim for. We’ve now got the security to say, ‘Christchurch has something worth investing in again.’”</p>
<p>Dr Shone says the former convention centre helped Christchurch to overcome seasonality issues, with winter a traditionally quiet period that was regularly boosted by the extra stream of visitors, so the loss of the complex had major effects.</p>
<p>“Without another reason for people to come to the city, it put up barriers for accommodation and hospitality providers. This new decision gives investors the security to make consequential decisions about where they spend their money.”</p>
