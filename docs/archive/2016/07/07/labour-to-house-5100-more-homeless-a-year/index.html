<p><strong>Thursday, 7 July 2016, 12:30 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Andrew Little<br><strong>Leader of the Opposition</strong></p>

<p><strong>Labour to house 5100 more homeless a year</strong></p>
<p>There would be 1400 new emergency accommodation places – enough to put a roof over the heads of 5100 homeless people a year – under Labour’s emergency housing policy announced today, Opposition Leader Andrew Little says.</p>
<p>“Too many of our families will spend this winter living in cars, couch surfing or cramped into the lounges and garages of relatives. It is a disgrace.</p>
<p>“A Labour Government will provide an additional $60 million over four years for supported transitional accommodation to help get people off the streets and into warm, dry temporary housing.</p>
<p>“That will provide 1400 beds or 5100 places a year which – along with current provisions – will bring the total emergency housing available to 8,100 with 2,200 beds at any given time.</p>
<p>“Recent <a href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/news/news/otago613529.html">Otago University research</a> estimated there are 42,000 homeless people throughout the country and of those, almost 4,200 are sleeping rough.</p>
<p>“This policy – along with Labour’s plans to launch a massive state-backed affordable house building programme and build more state houses rather than sell them off – will help end homelessness in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The homeless are the sharp end of the Government’s housing crisis. National has spent years turning a blind eye as skyrocketing rents pushed people out of their homes and onto the street.</p>
<p>“Labour will help them get a roof over their heads and back on their feet,” Andrew Little says.</p>
