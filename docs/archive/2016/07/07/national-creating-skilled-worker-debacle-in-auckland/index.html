<p>National Creating Skilled Worker Debacle in Auckland</p>
<p>Auckland is facing a major problem of skilled workers not wanting to go and live in the city or leaving because it is too expensive, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“The Minister of Housing Nick Smith said in Parliament today it was crucial to have skilled workers in Auckland for the building boom but he did not add that it was now impossible for a lot of them to buy a home there,” says New Zealand First Spokesman for Housing Denis O’Rourke.</p>
<p>“There have been reports in the media stating the government’s so-called comprehensive housing strategy is forcing skilled workers to leave Auckland.<br>“But today Dr Smith said skilled workers from overseas were needed for the Auckland building boom.</p>
<p>“So, we have the bizarre situation of foreign workers coming here while skilled Kiwis flee the city.</p>
<p>“This is typical of the messes the National government creates with their short-sighted, deficient policies.</p>
<p>“They failed to implement comprehensive programmes to train builders for the Canterbury Rebuild and now we have a shortage that in their view can only be filled by overseas workers.</p>
<p>“The average price for an Auckland house has skyrocketed to nearly $1 million with a deposit of $400,000 required – no wonder skilled Kiwis are leaving the city,” Mr O’Rourke says.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First would buy and develop land for low cost family homes on easy terms over 25 years, we would reduce demand in Auckland by making it illegal for non-residents, who are not New Zealand citizens, to buy houses.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First would also establish a Housing Commission to develop a genuine long term housing strategy for New Zealand comprising people who know what they are doing?”</p>
