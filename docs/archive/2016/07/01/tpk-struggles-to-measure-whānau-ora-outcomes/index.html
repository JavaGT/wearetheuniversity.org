<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>30 June 2016</p>
<p><strong>TPK struggles to measure Whānau Ora outcomes</strong></p>
<p>The Government needs to explain why so many vulnerable whanau are falling through the cracks, Labour’s Whānau Ora spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta says.</p>
<p>The Minister of Māori Development Te Ururoa Flavell attended the Māori Affairs Select Committee to highlight “gains” – $40m to support those with high and complex needs - in the 2016 Budget.</p>
<p>“I asked the Minister how Te Puni Kōkiri would evaluate Whānau Ora outcomes across three commissioning agencies which have very different approaches to lifting well-being. While the Minister was able to point to specific initiatives, he missed the whole point of the question.</p>
<p>“Te Puni Kōkiri appears to be working on a measurement framework to ensure monitoring oversight for the outcomes delivered through the three Whānau Ora commissioning agencies but there is a lack of detail about what that framework looks like and when Parliament might expect to see the report.</p>
<p>“Having received a briefing from one of the commissioning agencies I am aware that an incredible amount of work has gone into developing a data platform and service delivery model which is more responsive to multiple complex needs, and I will be seeking to invite these agencies to the Maori Affairs Select Committee.</p>
<p>“Mr Flavell needs to reassure taxpayers that there is a transparent reporting framework for Whānau Ora outcomes and the new commissioning agency funding model,” Nanaia Mahuta says.</p>
