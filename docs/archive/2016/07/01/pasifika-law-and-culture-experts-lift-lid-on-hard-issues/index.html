<p><strong>Pasifika law and culture experts lift lid on hard issues</strong></p>
<p>Academics, law practitioners, university and secondary school students will gather at Victoria University of Wellington next week to take part in the Pasifika Law and Culture Conference.</p>
<p>The annual conference ‘After Paris, After Winston – the PACIFIC’, has drawn big names for the three-day event, with keynote addresses by former Governor-General Sir Anand Satyanand, new Children’s Commissioner and former Principal Youth Court Judge Andrew Becroft, Victoria Pacific scholar Dr Teresia Teaiwa and Victoria’s School of Law’s Professor Tony Angelo.</p>
<p>The conference includes Pasifika students’ presentations on topics such as climate change, women in law, and youth, mental health and constitutional issues. Law students from six universities, including a team from the University of the South Pacific, will go head to head in a mooting competition. The final will be held on Tuesday evening (5 July) with Judge Sir David Carruthers leading the judging panel.</p>
<p>Professor Angelo says the conference programme will address a lot of the “hard issues” facing Pacific Island nations.</p>
<p>“This conference is going to open the lid on those hard issues that are often put in the ‘too hard’ basket. Throughout the conference, we’ll see rigorous debate from a range of voices on issues such as domestic violence, customary ownership, the Paris Agreement, agri-business and women’s rights.</p>
<p>“The goal behind this conference is to increase the understanding of Pacific legal issues and to strengthen relationships between Pacific legal scholars and students.”</p>
