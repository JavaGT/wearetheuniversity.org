<p><strong>STUDENT FRAUD LONG OCCURRING UNDER NATIONAL’S NOSES</strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand government is allowing Indian student fraud to go on under their noses, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“An Indian education consultant has told us agents are being used as scapegoats when the responsibility lies with the Minister for Tertiary Education Steven Joyce, Immigration New Zealand and Education New Zealand,” says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“He says former Immigration New Zealand contracted staff in India are bringing New Zealand’s reputation into disrepute by boasting they know how to work the system in New Zealand to get visas.</p>
<p>“The agent says Immigration New Zealand and Education NZ have long been aware of document fraud happening in India but have let it pass by.</p>
<p>“Most Indian students looking to study overseas prefer the US, UK or Australia while New Zealand is a low quality option where the main incentives for the students is getting a job and residency here, not an education.</p>
<p>“Nearly all attend courses, not at New Zealand’s eight universities, but at private training establishments (PTEs) or international training providers (ITPs) whose courses and qualifications are not recognised in India.</p>
<p>“The Association of Indian Universities does not recognise New Zealand diplomas but the Indian students seeking education in NZ are never told this.</p>
<p>“The agent says only a small number of PTEs and ITPs in New Zealand have good standards,” Mr Peters says.</p>
<p>A total of 9800 people arrived from India on student visas in the year to March 2016, according to Statistics New Zealand.</p>
