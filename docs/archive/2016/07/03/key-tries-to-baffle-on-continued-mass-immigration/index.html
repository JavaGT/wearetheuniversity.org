<p><strong>Sunday, 3 July 2016, 8:28 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>3 JULY 2016  </p>
<p><strong>KEY TRIES TO BAFFLE ON CONTINUED MASS IMMIGRATION</strong></p>
<p>John Key is deliberately flogging the excuse that record immigration of over 124,000 people a year is mostly planeloads of Kiwis returning from Australia.</p>
<p>“He’s wrong, and Statistics NZ figures prove he’s wrong,” says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Thousands more are still going to Australia than returning. Most of those returning are doing so because they are being treated as second-class citizens in Australia.</p>
<p>“Over there New Zealanders can’t access ACC, health, welfare, and other benefits.</p>
<p>“They have less rights than immigrants to Australia from Iraq, the UK, Bangladesh, Europe or Indonesia and all other countries as a result of the 2001 arrangement when Australia put its foot down on immigrants using New Zealand as a back door to Australia.</p>
<p>“The biggest driver of record immigration has been a mass influx of people coming in, many on work visas, and many low skilled, as Treasury points out.</p>
<p>“Mr Key refuses to recognise that his open door immigration has put enormous pressure on NZ – emergency departments are overloaded, schools are struggling to cope, housing is in crisis, wages are depressed, and migrants are being used as cheap labour.</p>
<p>“Excluding mass immigration, New Zealand’s GDP growth rate was 0.1 per cent for the first three months of the year, or less than half a per cent for the year.</p>

<p>“But like an addict he can’t get off mass immigration - consumerism from mass immigration is the biggest driver of our economy now.</p>
<p>“Mr Key also claims the record number of immigrants is a ‘vote of confidence’ in this country.</p>
<p>“Wrong again – much of the world is a hell hole from which many are trying to escape. We are the last choice for many after first being rejected by the UK, Canada and Australia, and the US – NZ is the last resort.</p>
<p>“Wise, controlled and reduced immigration would help our economy, mindless mass immigration does not.</p>
<p>“If there is one position out of this policy shambles it is that more and more commentators are belatedly coming to understand that,” says Mr Peters.</p>
