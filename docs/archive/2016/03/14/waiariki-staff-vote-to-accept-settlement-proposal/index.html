<p><strong>Waiariki staff vote to accept settlement proposal</strong></p>
<p>Allied staff employed at Waiariki Institute of Technology today voted to ratify the settlement proposal that the party reached in urgent discussions last week.</p>
<p>The settlement provides for a salary increase of 1.5% with a minimum increase of $725.00 and is backdated to 1st January 2016.</p>
<p>“Having a minimum dollar amount of $725.00 means that those on the lower salary rates will benefit the most and will receive increases up to 2%” said TIASA Chief Executive, Peter Joseph. “Just as importantly, the settlement also provides certainty and protection for those Waiariki staff employed at the Holiday Park” said Joseph.</p>
<p>A vote on strike action was deferred when urgent discussions between the Chief Executives of Waiariki and TIASA resulted in agreement to urgently reconvene bargaining last week.</p>
<p>“All parties are pleased that a reasonable settlement has been achieved and that students have not been impacted” said Joseph. “The focus is now on the merger date of 1st May and the considerable work and challenges that both staff and management as this date nears”.</p>
