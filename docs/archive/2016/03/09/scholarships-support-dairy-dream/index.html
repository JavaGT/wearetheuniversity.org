<p>Scholarships support dairy dream</p>
<p>Lincoln University students are continuing to reap rewards by focusing on a future in New Zealand’s primary industries.</p>
<p>Thirty one of the 55 dairy industry scholarships DairyNZ have given this year have gone to Lincoln students.</p>
<p>Ten were new, with the rest receiving continuing support from the industry body as the scholarships can run for up to four years, as long as grades are acceptable.<br>The scholarship assists with the costs of university study - up to $6325 per year – and are awarded to outstanding students with a particular interest in dairying, and who are undertaking an agriculture or agricultural-related degree.</p>
<p>They are intended to encourage talented and motivated people to join the industry as future research scientists, farm advisors, farm managers, farm owners and rural professionals.</p>
<p>The successful students were at a dinner last week to confer the awards.</p>
<p>Lincoln University Scholarships Manager Jane Edwards says the continuing support from DairyNZ is a great help to the students, and the more than 20 being able to continue with the scholarship because they are working hard to achieve their goals shows the award is working.</p>
<p>DairyNZ industry education facilitator Susan Stokes says the quality of applications this year was particularly high and bodes well for future talent coming into the dairy industry.</p>
<p>Introduced in 2001, DairyNZ Scholarships are awarded to outstanding students with a particular interest in dairying, and who are undertaking an agriculture or agricultural-related degree at Lincoln, Massey or Waikato Universities.</p>
