<p>Seymour challenges Dom Post editorial writer to name themselves and visit a Partnership School</p>
<p>Press release: ACT New Zealand<br>March 3, 2016. 3:40pm</p>
<p>ACT Leader David Seymour is challenging the author of the <em>Dominion Post</em>’s editorial <em>Unfair bias to charter schools</em> to identify themselves and actually visit Partnership Schools Kura Hourua.</p>
<p>“The <em>Dom Post</em>’s editorial page has featured a string of attacks on and insinuation about Partnership Schools. These columns are anonymous, but the paranoid hyperbole appears to be that of a single author. They ought to name themselves, so they can be accountable for their claims.</p>
<p>“Writing in the name of the newspaper is a time-honoured tradition, but this author has lowered the_Dom Post_ editorial to the level of anonymous blog comment.</p>
<p>“I wonder if this person has even visited a Partnership School. Meeting the inspirational community leaders who run these schools may counter the author’s assumptions about any political motives behind the policy.</p>
<p>“They might ask the 26 community groups why they applied to open Partnership Schools last year. Quite simply, Partnership Schools meet a demand in the community that is not met by the current education system.</p>
<p>“Seeing the extraordinary successes of the students, many of whom were disillusioned with their previous schools, may convince the author of the opportunities Partnership Schools offer young people.</p>
<p>“Aside from opening their eyes to the energy and positivity of Partnership Schools, such visits might help them get a few facts straight.</p>
<p>“The small payments made to these schools are not bonuses. Instead, they represent 1% of the schools’ assigned funding, which is withheld conditional on performance reporting. This system of withholding funding exemplifies the schools’ high levels of accountability.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Education, the Authorisation Board, and the Minister all agreed that the few instances of targets not being met were well-justified and of a minor nature, hence the schools received their full funding.</p>
<p>“The author’s claim that the Government wants to see the schools ‘succeed even when they fail’ is laughable coming at a time when one Partnership School is being closed down due to poor performance.</p>
<p>“Charter school policies have experienced well-documented success in the United States, Canada, and Sweden. But even here the author clings manically to the unsurprising fact that some dispute these figures.</p>
<p>“Ultimately the <em>Dom Post</em>’s editorial stance is depressing. These education innovators should be continue to be commended for their bravery, supported in their efforts, be accountable for their failures, and congratulated for their successes, not run down by relentless and spurious negativity.”</p>
