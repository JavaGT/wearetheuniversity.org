<p>03 March 2016</p>
<p>As Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at one of the world’s leading Universities, Karen Willcox has two passions in her life: education and the dream of one day becoming an astronaut.</p>
<p>Visiting New Zealand this month to receive a Distinguished Alumna Award from the University of Auckland, Professor Willcox of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has achieved one of those dreams.</p>
<p>“Education is central to everything I do, I see my teaching as a very privileged position where I get to mentor the coming generations who will help shape our world,” she says. “To me there is no role more fulfilling or more important than that.”</p>
<p>But, she adds, “I still haven’t given up on my second dream – NASA is currently recruiting for another class of astronauts and maybe this will be my year!”</p>
<p>Professor Willcox leads a number of educational initiatives at MIT including research into educational technologies that help promote ‘blended learning’ of both face-to-face and online teaching programmes.</p>
<p>“New technologies can help us reimagine the way we teach engineering,” she says. “They provide real flexibility such as the idea that one of my students might be working on a rocket in the desert while still being able to access my classes online.”</p>
<p>Professor Willcox graduated from the University of Auckland’s Faculty of Engineering in 1994 and went on to complete her master’s degree and a PhD in engineering at MIT, regularly ranked one of the world’s top universities.</p>
<p>She is a co-director of MIT’s Center for Computational Engineering and has worked at the US space agency NASA’s Dryden Flight Research Center. She has also worked as an engineering researcher with aircraft manufacturer Boeing. Some of her computational methods have been widely applied in aircraft system design and environmental policy decision-making.</p>
<p>She is an Associate Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and sits on the advisory board for the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>Her passion for education includes a strong interest in promoting girls’ and young women’s interest in science, mathematics and engineering.</p>
<p>“There are so many opportunities in engineering, designing a better future for our world,” Professor Willcox says. “To make that a reality, we need to draw on the passions, the inspirations and the different viewpoints of young people from all across society.”</p>
