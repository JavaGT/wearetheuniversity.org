<p><strong>American E-learning expert to visit NZ in April</strong></p>
<p>Well-known international academic and corporate trainer in e-learning, Professor Curt Bonk from Indiana University will be speaking at the national ‘DEANZ2016’ Conference hosted at the University of Waikato on the 17th to 20th April.</p>
<p>Professor Bonk, a well-known authority on emerging technologies for learning, will offer insights into the intersection of business, education, psychology, and technology.</p>
<p>The conference attracts educators, corporate trainers and professional developers working in the area of open, distance, flexible and mobile learning and is open to anyone interested in this fast developing field of open and flexible education.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, the Ministry of Education has recognised the importance of e-learning and is currently working with schools to ensure they have access to modern technology to ensure better learning outcomes.</p>
<p>This is being achieved through a number of initiatives including the ultrafast broadband (UFB) roll out which means that educational institutions and businesses have the infrastructure needed to access high quality educational and training content and services to break down the traditional barriers of geographical isolation.</p>
<p>Professor Bonk will give a keynote speech on Education 3.0 and its impact on educators and trainers, and conduct a workshop on how to effectively engage learners in this digital era.</p>
<p>Having received several outstanding practitioner awards for his work in online and distance education, Professor Bonk firmly believes in online learning and says he is a “product” of it.</p>

<p>“Open education is an opportunity for anyone to learn anything from anyone else at any time. Age does not matter. Looks do not matter. Nor does gender, personality, previous experience, educational level, family and political connections, or money in the bank. One just has to be willing to learn.”</p>
<p>Professor Bonk has authored and edited several widely used technology books, the latest being ‘MOOCs and Open Education Around the World’ (2015). He also reflects on his speaking experiences around the world in his popular blog, TravelinEdMan.</p>
