<p>Mick Abbott will be awarded a Master of Landscape Architecture and Sharon Lucock will be awarded a doctorate in Agribusiness Systems.

<p>Each of the ceremonies will be preceded by a procession of graduands from the university’s iconic Ivey Hall (Library) through Lincoln township to the Lincoln Event Centre, where the ceremonies have been held since the 2011 earthquake.</p>
<p>Two honorary doctorates and the Bledisloe Medal will be presented at the graduation ceremonies. An honorary Doctorate of Science will be awarded to the Hon John Luxton QSO at the morning ceremony in recognition of his contribution to agriculture and the dairy industry in particular. A recipient of the Queen’s Service Order and an A.C. Cameron Award winner, John Luxton is also a former parliamentarian and Minister of the Crown.
