<p><em>- for immediate release</em></p>
<p><strong>Food development facility opportunity for creative entrepreneurs</strong></p>
<p>Those looking to be innovative with their food are wanted at the FoodSouth food development pilot plant on the Lincoln campus, but there are no Heston Blumenthal creations on the menu.</p>
<p>The final part of a national food innovation network, the facility provides three purpose-built independent food safe development spaces along with a variety of processing equipment — an extruder, ovens, dryers, enrober, mixers, and a mobile product development kitchen among them.</p>
<p>It enables businesses to develop product prototypes for market validation, trial new equipment, carry out scale-up trial work and sample manufacture in 20L to 200L batch sizes, conduct process development and improvement, and validate quality systems.</p>
<p>Lincoln’s Business Development Manager Dr Samuel Yu says the facility can help businesses and entrepreneurs to accelerate their food innovation, manufacturing, and operations, and expand their reach in market export.</p>
<p>“Having students, technical specialists, researchers and businesses in the same area establishes a dynamic, innovative environment to work in. Anybody that wants to learn and work in this agribusiness and food science sector should consider this location,” Dr Yu says.</p>
<p>“It is great to get this new production facility open for business. We welcome opportunities to work with industry and businesses in collaboration with FoodSouth’s professional team to expand NZ Inc’s reach in the land-based markets, and offer unique opportunities for our students and staff.”</p>
<p>CEO of The New Zealand Food Innovation Network – South Island, (FoodSouth), John Morgan, says high quality development space, equipment and help are available for hire to food and beverage businesses for applications including bakery products, snack foods, sauces, powders, beverages and meat products.</p>
<p>The initiative is a collaboration between Callaghan Innovation, Canterbury Development Corporation (CDC) and Lincoln University, and has drawn support from industry including Fonterra, ANZCO Foods and Drying Solutions.</p>
