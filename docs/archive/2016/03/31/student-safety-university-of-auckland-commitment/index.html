<p>The University of Auckland is committed to a safe, inclusive and equitable environment for our domestic and international students. When we welcome international students to our campus we are proud to offer them a learning and research experience in one of the most liveable and diverse cities in the world. New Zealand has a reputation as a safe and welcoming destination for students from around the world*.</p>
<p>Recently however, four international students (two of whom were from the University of Auckland) and two young international visitors were robbed in public spaces close to Auckland tertiary education institutions.</p>
<p>The University moved swiftly to support our students and they quickly returned to their studies. There was a major public meeting involving Chinese students and community leaders, university leaders, senior police officers, central and local government politicians and officials.  Two further public meetings followed.</p>
<p>The initial response to all three incidents has been swift, inclusive and transparent. Work continues to further enhance the safety of students in Auckland. Central and local government officials and university representatives have met to consider additional safety actions.  These include lighting and CCTV in public spaces frequented by students.</p>
<p>A new police safety initiative called Cop Chat has also begun.  It’s a weekly event at Auckland Central City Library where police, including an Asian liaison officer, are available to speak with students.  Cop Chat builds on the existing support Auckland Police offer students.</p>
<p>This includes the monthly International Student Ambassador meetings, which now involve 96 student representatives from Auckland tertiary education institutions.  There is also a Police “auntie and uncles” programme for Chinese students.  This programme links the students with Chinese living in Auckland who can assist them to navigate life in our city. Auckland Police have increased on-the-ground police presence in a number of areas.</p>
<p>The University will continue to work with students, police, local and national governments to ensure a positive student experience for our diverse domestic and international student communities.</p>

<p>*Auckland is rated the third best city in the world in a survey measuring quality of life and it is more culturally diverse than Sydney, London, Los Angeles and New York.</p>
<p>The annual quality of life survey from recruitment consultancy Mercer is based on factors such as culture and environment, political stability, safety, infrastructure and ease of doing business.  The 2016 rating is the fourth time Auckland has been ranked third in the survey, following podium places in 2012, 2014 and 2015.</p>
<p>Our research tells us that safety is a primary concern for students and their parents when they consider an institution and city.  The University of Auckland is proud of the student score of 93 percent for safety in the 2015 International Student Barometer. This is the largest survey of its kind.</p>
<p>The score reflects the Global Peace Index, which ranks New Zealand the fourth most peaceful country in the world.  Our crime rates are much lower than other countries</p>
