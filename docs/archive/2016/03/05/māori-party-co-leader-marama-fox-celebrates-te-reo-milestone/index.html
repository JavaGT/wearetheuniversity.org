<p><strong>Māori Party Co-leader Marama Fox celebrates te reo milestone for Wairoa</strong></p>
<p>Māori Party Co-leader Marama Fox is joining in the festivities for Te Ataarangi o Te Wairoa and its education arm Te Kura Motuhake o Te Ataarangi which both celebrate two significant birthdays today.</p>
<p>“These two institutions have added to the identity of Wairoa. They have helped transform the lives of hundreds of people from all walks of life and supported them on their language journey,” she says.</p>
<p>Te Ataarangi o Te Wairoa is marking its 30th anniversary, while Te Kura Motuhake o Te Ataarangi turns 20.</p>
<p>Mana Elizabeth Hunkin has championed the development of the organisations.</p>
<p>“`Whaea Liz and her staff have provided a beacon of hope for many people including beneficiaries, Affco workers and doctors to learn the language in a total immersion environment,” says Marama Fox.</p>
<p>Whaea Liz has been recognised for her contribution to te reo Māori through various awards, her most recent accolade was last year’s Te Taura Whiri i te reo Māori - Māori Language Leadership recipient.</p>
<p>“Whaea Liz and her team have helped many graduates, most of whom have moved into advanced tertiary education studying at a bachelor or master degree level.”</p>
<p>“Ultimately, I am very pleased that graduates are enhancing the mana of their whanau, hapū and marae by sharing their knowledge as ringawera and kaikaranga on their marae, but also contributing immensely as kaiako in kura and kōhanga reo,” she says.</p>
