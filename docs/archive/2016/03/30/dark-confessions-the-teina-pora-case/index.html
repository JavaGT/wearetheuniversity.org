<p>Dark Confessions: The Teina Pora case</p>
<p>A 17-year-old car thief confessed to a crime he didn’t commit and spent 22 years in jail. How did one of New Zealand&#39;s worst miscarriages of justice happen?</p>
<p>South Auckland teenager Teina Pora was wrongly convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Susan Burdett, who had been beaten to death in her own home.</p>
<p>Eighteen years later, Tim McKinnel, an ex-cop turned private investigator, discovered the case, saw an injustice had been done, and set out to win Pora’s freedom.</p>
<p>In this upcoming UC Connect public lecture, McKinnel, the investigator who drove the successful fight to overturn Pora&#39;s convictions, and Michael Bennett, author of the book on the case In Dark Places and writer/director of the award-winning documentary The Confessions of Prisoner T, will discuss the case at the University of Canterbury on Monday 4 April at 7pm.</p>
<p>They will show excerpts from the controversial police interviews that lead to Teina Pora’s arrest and convictions, and answer questions from the audience after their public talk in a Q&amp;A session.</p>
<p>The story of the long battle to win freedom for an innocent man is a fascinating insight into a range of issues, from the psychology of false confessions, the safety of the New Zealand justice system, and the role of media in raising public awareness.</p>
<p>UC Connect public lecture - Dark Confessions: The Teina Pora case, 7pm, Monday 4 April, Ilam campus of the University of Canterbury.</p>
