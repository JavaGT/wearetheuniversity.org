<p><strong>Cambridge local takes center stage with top scholarship</strong></p>
<p>From school plays to the world stage. At least that’s the plan for Cambridge local Georgia Pollock who’s won a top scholarship from the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>The former Sacred Heart Girls’ College student is the proud recipient of a Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship - an all-fees paying scholarship that supports students in a chosen discipline, and provides mentoring, personal development and leadership opportunities while they study.</p>
<p>From the age of five, theatre has been a huge part of Georgia’s life and she plans to keep it that way. Now in her second year of a Bachelor of Arts, double majoring in Theatre and English, she says the scholarship will be crucial for balancing all her commitments.</p>
<p>“Theatre takes over your life – which is fantastic, but it makes maintaining a social- and academic-life quite difficult,” says Georgia. “The Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship Programme will be the key to making it all work because of the mentoring and networking support we’re given.”</p>
<p>Originally from England, Georgia moved to Cambridge when she was nine. The first show she remembers performing in was her primary school’s rendition of the Nativity Scene. Now she’s got a long list of shows to her name including, Wizard of Oz, Spelling Bee and Godspell.</p>
<p>Musicals can be very draining, especially when there’s a lot of dancing involved, but Georgia says crying on stage is the most challenging task of all.</p>
<p>“Having a meltdown on stage takes every ounce of your energy – give me a long dance number any day!”</p>
<p>But the rush of being on stage makes the gruelling rehearsals all worth it.</p>
<p>“Immersing yourself in the role of your character is totally liberating and I’d say anyone who hasn’t tried it yet needs to.”</p>
<p>Georgia plans to do a degree in teaching once she completes her BA with the hope of taking her love for theatre abroad and teaching it to people who have limited access to such experiences.</p>
<p>“I also hope to one day travel to England and try my luck on the West End.”</p>
