<p><strong>Putting New Zealand’s Co-Op Economy on the Map</strong></p>
<p>Massey University researchers are collaborating with colleagues at the University of Auckland and Cooperative Business New Zealand on a research project that aims to explore the co-operative economy and its contribution to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Lead researcher Dr Elena Garnevska from Massey University says co-operatives provide a significant economic and social contribution, but they are not well-recognised in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“This is a unique collaboration between two pre-eminent universities and the industry body – Cooperative Business New Zealand – to design and execute a study that provides an accurate picture of New Zealand’s cooperative economy landscape.</p>
<p>“The team from Massey University are also investigating the social capital and organisational innovation in co-operatives, which aligns with our expertise as the only university to provide a postgraduate course in co-operative leadership and management,” she says.</p>
<p>The project aims to comprehensively list the top 30-40 co-operatives in New Zealand, and analyse the contribution of these organisations to the New Zealand economy based on objective data. The project will also provide the basis for a longitudinal study of the industry, which will be able to map long-term trends and cycles. Key issues faced by these cooperatives will be identified too and it is anticipated that these will help shape subsequent research on NZ&#39;s co-operative economy.</p>

<p>Dr Lisa Callagher from University of Auckland says her team will extend their existing research on innovation practices in entrepreneurial co-operatives.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be working with our Massey colleagues and partners at Cooperative Business New Zealand to understand and document the contribution of New Zealand’s co-operative economy in a way that is relevant and accessible for those working in and with organisations committed to co-operative principles,” she says.</p>
<p>“Leveraging the expertise across our research groups through this project gives us an opportunity to undertake the type of study that gives us a comprehensive picture that can guide further industry and policy development, as well as a platform for industry-informed research.”</p>
<p>Cooperative Business New Zealand chief executive Ian Macintosh says the project provides New Zealand with a platform to lead the world in research into co-operatives.</p>
<p>“The project will also highlight the innovation and successes of New Zealand co-operatives and create research data that will be of assistance to governments and other research centres. It is indeed a unique collaboration between two of New Zealand’s finest institutions,” he says.</p>
<p>The project launch will be announced at the Cooperative Business NZ gala dinner for the visiting International Cooperative Association&#39;s visiting delegation to be held in Auckland this evening.</p>
