<p>A new catalyst for business sustainability in New Zealand</p>
<p>The University of Auckland Business School is bringing New Zealand business leaders together to stimulate debate and action on pressing sustainability challenges in its inaugural Sustainability Week series of events.</p>
<p>Business has a pivotal role to play in slowing climate change, improving social justice, and stepping up to other sustainability challenges. There’s growing recognition that what’s good for the environment and society is usually good for the financial bottom line, especially in the long term.</p>
<p>The Business School is drawing on its deep expertise and close industry ties to launch a new Sustainability Programme with a week of debate and action, from Monday 4 April to Friday 8 April.</p>
<p>“Our aim is to be amongst the leading universities internationally on the issues of sustainability,” says programme leader and former executive director of Oxfam New Zealand, Barry Coates.</p>
<p>“We’ve looked to the examples of universities at the vanguard – Yale, Cambridge, MIT. Their experience shows that innovative practice in universities can ensure the next generation of leaders understand the values and practices of sustainability that can drive success for their enterprise and for society in a rapidly evolving future.”</p>
<p>Another important role universities can play is that of convenor – “bringing different stakeholders together around sustainability issues – often people who don&#39;t necessarily agree with each other or talk with each other.</p>
