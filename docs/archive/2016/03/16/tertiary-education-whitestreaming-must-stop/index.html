<p><strong>Wednesday, 16 March 2016, 11:49 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tertiary education “whitestreaming” must stop</strong></p>
<p>Labour is calling on universities, polytechnics and wananga to stop so-called “whitestreaming”, where specialist Māori jobs and services are replaced by generalist positions, Labour’s Māori Education spokesperson Adrian Rurawhe says.</p>
<p>“A <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/ED1603/S00057/maori-students-lose-study-support-to-whitestreaming.htm">new report</a> by the Tertiary Education Union has found every university in New Zealand, most polytechnics and even one wānanga has cut jobs that support Māori students.</p>
<p>“The Union says this ‘whitestreaming’ has resulted in positions for Māori academic support officers – who provide academic support and pastoral care to Māori students – being replaced with general support officers who help all students.</p>
<p>“It beggars belief that our tertiary institutions are doing this when they are well aware of the need for better educational outcomes for Māori and increase the number getting post school qualifications.</p>
<p>“Many universities and polytechnics have support officers for international students. Why wouldn’t you give Māori at least the same level of support?</p>
<p>“Labour joins with the TEU to call for an immediate end to these jobs cuts,” Adrian Rurawhe says.</p>
