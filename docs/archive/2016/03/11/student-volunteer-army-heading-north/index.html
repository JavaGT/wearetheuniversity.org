<p>Student Volunteer Army heading North to assist in building section of Marlborough Sounds</p>
<p>On Saturday 12th March, 90 members of the UC Student Volunteer Army (SVA) will be based in the Marlborough Sounds, assisting in the construction of a 5 kilometre section of the Link Pathway for the first ever “SVA Camp”. This will be the first time in its 5 year history the Volunteer Army has travelled out of Christchurch to assist on a community project.</p>
<p>Rick Edmonds initiated the project in 2003 with the assistance of local residents, addressing the need for a pedestrian accessway which would prevent local children from having to walk along on the road verge to get to school. Following its success, the combined sections of the Link Pathway are now expected to extend for 42 kilometres through the Sounds and connect the bays to the nearby towns of Havelock and Picton. The Student Volunteer Army will be putting some of the finishing touches on the route, laying gravel and smoothing the track surface to have it up to the DOC Daywalk Standard.</p>
<p>The project will further encourage and activate students to be the change in their community while developing intergenerational ties. Five years after the February 22nd earthquake, this initial vision remains strong with projects such as this setting the scene for the Student Volunteer Army’s future direction.</p>
