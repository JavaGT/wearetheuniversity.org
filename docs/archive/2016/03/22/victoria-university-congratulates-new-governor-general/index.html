<p>Victoria University congratulates new Governor-General</p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington has extended congratulations to New Zealand’s next Governor-General, Dame Patsy Reddy, who has a long-standing association with the University.</p>
<p>Dame Patsy studied at Victoria, gaining a Master of Laws in 1979. She has been a lecturer at Victoria’s Law School, and is a current member of the Victoria University Council.</p>
<p>She has also served as a trustee for the Victoria University of Wellington Foundation, the University’s charitable trust, and been a trustee for the Adam Art Gallery and the Victoria University of Wellington Art Collection Trust.</p>
<p>Dame Patsy is presently a non-executive director, a lawyer, chief Crown negotiator for Treaty of Waitangi settlements, and a lead reviewer for the Performance Improvement Framework for the State Services Commission.</p>
<p>Victoria University Chancellor Sir Neville Jordan says Dame Patsy’s appointment to the role of Governor-General is a testament to her hard work and the esteem in which she’s held.</p>
<p>“We at Victoria are immensely proud of her strong connections to the University, going back to when she was a student here through to the present day with her position on the University Council. Dame Patsy is a very distinguished alumna and is a fantastic choice for the job of New Zealand’s vice-regal.”</p>
<p>In addition to her work for Victoria, Dame Patsy is Chair of the New Zealand Film Commission and Education Payroll Ltd, Deputy Chair of the New Zealand Transport Agency, a director of Payments New Zealand Ltd and Active Equity Holdings Ltd. Her previous directorships include Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Ltd, SKYCITY Entertainment Group Ltd, New Zealand Post and Air New Zealand Ltd.</p>
<p>She is also a former chair of the New Zealand Film Archive and a trustee for the New Zealand International Arts Festival and the Wellington Jazz Festival, among others.</p>
<p>Dame Patsy succeeds Sir Jerry Mateparae and will begin her five year term on September 14.</p>
