<p><strong>Extinction: Which species should we save?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Join Kim Hill in this popular annual event for a stimulating Annual Earth Hour panel discussion as she</strong> leads six panellists in thought provoking, entertaining debate on this crucial issue.</p>
<p>This year&#39;s panellists and their position statements:</p>
<p>• <strong>Te Awhina Arahanga: Taumutu Rūnaka Ngāi Tahu:</strong> Curator, writer, poet and researcher. Raised in the tiny settlement of Taumutu at the southern end of Lake Ellesmere. Works and lives between Christchurch and Auckland.</p>
<p>&quot;Today political, economic and social influences determine the right of survival of flora and fauna. Each decision must be quantified and justified yet the choice sometimes comes down to the cute, sweet and beautiful leaving the ugly, slimy and microscopic invisible and insecure. Who shall be protected?”</p>
<p>• <strong>Dr Bill Lee:</strong> Principal Scientist at Landcare Research and part-time Professor of Ecology, School of Biological Sciences University of Auckland.Honorary Professor in the Botany Department at the University of Otago. Science Advisor for the NZ Biological Heritage, National Science Challenge.</p>
<p>“Threatened species may be a necessary conservation hook but in my view biodiversity is most securely protected when we focus on sustaining the range of native ecosystems.”</p>
<p>• <strong>James Ross:</strong> Senior Lecturer in Biometrics and Wildlife Management at Lincoln University.</p>
<p>**“**We are losing the battle for our birds on the mainland. I am pro-1080. It is currently the best tool for wide-spread control of possums, rodents and stoats, but others are in the pipeline.”<br>• <strong>Mike Thorsen:</strong> Endangered Species Foundation. Has worked with some of the world&#39;s most endangered plants and animals. Instigator and major driver of the recently-launched Endangered Species Foundation which has raised over $1 million dollars to support those protecting New Zealand&#39;s endangered species.</p>

<p>“Conservation needs everybody and New Zealand&#39;s forgotten species need attention: they&#39;re often rarer than kakapo, cute and charismatic (in their own way), and MUCH cheaper.”</p>
<p>• <strong>Nicola Toki:</strong> DOC Threatened Species Ambassador. Studied Zoology and Law at the University of Otago, a self-confessed “Nature Nerd”.</p>
<p>“Our challenge is to get people to not only love something as uncharismatic as the knobbled weevil, but also the Mackenzie Drylands Basin, to engage with the public in a narrative that points out our biodiversity crisis in a way that provides a message of hope that they can reach out and engage with.”</p>
<p>• <strong>Professor Steve Wratten:</strong> Professor of Ecology at Lincoln University and Bio-Protection Research Centre staff member. World leader in biological control of pests.</p>
<p>“ALL rare endemic species in NZ should be saved-we owe it to future generations. The government is subsidising oil by $80 million and also subsidising farming by an enormous amount- conservation is all about priorities, not funding availability.”</p>
