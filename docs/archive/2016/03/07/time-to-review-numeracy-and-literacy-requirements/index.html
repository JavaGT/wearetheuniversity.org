<p><strong>Monday, 7 March 2016, 11:47 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Time to review numeracy and literacy requirements</strong></p>
<p>It is time to review NCEA benchmarks for literacy and numeracy after a report found they are not meeting the standards required in the workforce, Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>“It is hugely concerning that the Tertiary Education Commission has <a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/298249/school-leavers'-skills-questioned">found</a> students with poor maths and reading skills are meeting NCEA requirements.</p>
<p>“This reinforces feedback from tertiary education providers who say students are arriving through their door unprepared for future study.</p>
<p>“It is crucial that our education system is preparing students for today’s workforce and the workforce of the future.</p>
<p>“National is obsessed with its artificial targets. This report shows that schools are so busy trying to meet the Government’s targets for NCEA, students are passing their grades without learning what they need to know.</p>
<p>“Labour believes the education system must prepare New Zealanders for the future of work. That’s why we will give every New Zealander, who hasn’t had tertiary education, three free years of post-school study or training throughout their lives,” Chris Hipkins says.</p>
