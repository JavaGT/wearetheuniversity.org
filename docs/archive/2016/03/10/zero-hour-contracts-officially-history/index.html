<p><strong>Thursday, 10 March 2016, 4:41 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Council_of_Trade_Unions">Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Zero hour contracts officially history</strong></p>
<p>Today in Parliament the Government, along with its support parties, and those in opposition, voted in agreement to end the ability of employers to use corrosive zero hour contracts.</p>
<p>“As a society we are changing. Modern work means treating working people with more dignity and respect. The fact that this legislation has received cross party support is testament to a new vision; a better working life for all kiwis,” said CTU President Richard Wagstaff.</p>
<p>“This better law would never have happened without those that lead the forward charge in articulating an alternative. Special acknowledgement to Unite Union members who have, for a number of years, told their very personal stories about what it means to have no security of hours or income from week to week,”</p>
<p>“Thousands and thousands of working people participated in creating a sea change. They wrote letters, lobbied politicians, attended rallies, talked to their friends and families. Today’s win is their win, it is a win for us all,” Wagsatff said.</p>
