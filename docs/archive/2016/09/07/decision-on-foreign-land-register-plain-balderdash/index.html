<p><strong>DECISION ON FOREIGN LAND REGISTER: PLAIN BALDERDASH</strong></p>
<p><strong>Attorney-General behaving like officious nerd</strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand First Leader has labelled the Attorney-General’s finding that a register of land owned by foreigners would be a breach of the Bill of Rights as “plain balderdash”.</p>
<p>“This opinion from the Attorney-General stands in stark contrast to Australia where there is such a register, while in other countries they are well aware of who owns what and where, with the laws to find out,” the Northland MP, Rt Hon Winston Peters, said.</p>
<p>“Does it mean that all other countries that have restrictions on foreign ownership and the laws to identify them are somehow breaching basic human rights? Of course, not.</p>
<p>Only a “plutocractic officious nerd” would come to such inelegant conclusions, Mr Peters said.</p>
<p>“Apparently the Attorney-General thinks that having such legislation would breach the privacy of foreign buyers.</p>
<p>“Privacy is of course what money launderers and investors trying to evade their own country’s jurisdiction love the most, and the Attorney-General seems to be right up their alley.</p>
<p>“If this is a privacy issue then does it mean we can’t charge foreign visitors for a medical bill when they attend one of our hospitals, or a foreign student when they attend one of our educational institutions?”</p>
<p>The Attorney-General would be wise to stop “forlornly posing as a modern Blackstone of the Antipodes” and settle for plain common sense rulings, Mr Peters said.</p>
