<p>Press release: Climate Leadership and Ethical Investment wanted at The University of Auckland<br>Tuesday 6th September 2016, 7:30am</p>
<p>Staff, students, and climate movement leaders are gathering at The University of Auckland this Thursday 15th September, calling on the University’s Vice Chancellor Stuart McCutcheon to step up on climate change and divest from fossil fuel companies.</p>
<p>Ivan Mouraviev, communications manager for the student-led group Fossil Free UoA who are behind the event, says the aim is to celebrate those taking leadership on climate change while urging VC McCutcheon to act.</p>
<p>“Climate change is the defining issue of our time. It’s also one of the most urgent. On the 15th of September we’re celebrating climate leaders in New Zealand but also highlighting that the University of Auckland’s leadership is lagging behind”, said Mouraviev.</p>
<p>“UoA is now the only major New Zealand University without serious restrictions on where it invests, including its endowment fund of over $80 million. VC McCutcheon, as the face and spokesperson of the University, we call on you to step up and divest from fossil fuels now.”</p>
<p>Open to the public, the event runs 6-8pm on 15th September at The Garden Room, Shadows Bar, on campus. Attendees can expect a relaxed atmosphere with live music, an overview of the divestment movement, and three guest speakers including Niki Harre — leader of the Faculty of Science Sustainability Network and Associate Professor in Psychology at the University of Auckland.</p>

<p>A motion to support fossil fuel divestment supported by over ten students’ associations was presented on June 13th, by the student representative on the University Council AUSA President Will Matthews. Although supported by some at the Council table, no vote was taken by the University Chancellor on the motion. Instead, it was resolved to pass the students&#39; concerns privately to the Foundation chair.</p>
<p>Said Mouraviev: &quot;Indeed, we’re disappointed by the University Council so far. They’ve shirked responsibility by failing to lead their staff who produce world-class climate research and students whose futures are at stake.”</p>
<p>“However, we’re hopeful the University will show leadership and divest — especially now that our KiwiSaver providers and banks are on public display for similar failings on ethical investment. Our society is clearly not okay with retirement funds investing in cluster bombs or tobacco. Why should University money and the destructive fossil fuel industry be different?”</p>
<p>Hundreds of universities and institutions with assets worth $3.4 trillion, including Yale, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) across the ditch, have already divested from oil, gas and coal companies — citing both moral concerns about contributing to climate change and financial prudence as motivating factors.</p>
<p>Young Alumna of 2016 Dr Divya Dhar, in her statement supporting the Fossil Free UoA campaign, added: “Climate change is a tragic reality for all of us, especially those that have and will become climate refugees. It is paramount that our university becomes a bastion of hope in correcting this wrong, and building a sustainable fossil fuel free future.”</p>
