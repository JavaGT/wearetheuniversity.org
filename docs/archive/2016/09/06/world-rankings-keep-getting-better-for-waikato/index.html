<p><strong>World rankings keep getting better for Waikato</strong></p>
<p>The University of Waikato has gone up again in world university rankings, climbing 14 places from 2015 and more than 80 places since 2014.</p>
<p>Data released today by the annual Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings show the University of Waikato is now placed 324 in the world – up from 338 in 2015. In 2014 Waikato was ranked in the 401-410 band of universities.</p>
<p>QS ranks universities across a range of areas including reputation, research, teaching, employability and internationalisation.</p>
<p>University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley says the continued rise in world rankings is a reflection of the University’s ability to adapt to a changing global tertiary landscape and prepare students for a world outside university.</p>
<p>“We know what a significant part rankings play in the decision making process of students, particularly international students, and we are delighted to have QS rank the university in the top 3% of all universities worldwide” says Professor Quigley.</p>
<p>The world rankings announcement comes after another rankings win for the University, which recently received a full five-star rating from QS. The QS Stars Rankings rates universities across a broad range of criteria, including teaching quality and satisfaction, employability, research, internationalisation, facilities, innovation and inclusiveness.</p>

<p>Rankings play a significant part in the perception of the University as a quality teaching and research institution. It also plays a part in reassuring students that their education from the University of Waikato is among the best internationally. It is a particularly important aspect in the decision making process of international students looking to study abroad.</p>
