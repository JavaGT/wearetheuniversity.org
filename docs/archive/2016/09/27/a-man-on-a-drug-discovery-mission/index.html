<p>A man on a drug discovery mission</p>
<p>A Victoria University of Wellington professor, whose work has led to trials for the treatment of cancers and gout, says New Zealand is carrying out world class research in drug discovery.</p>
<p>Professor Peter Tyler from Victoria’s Ferrier Research Institute’s career in chemistry spans 35 years—and 32 patents for potential drug candidates.</p>
<p>“Drug discovery is absolutely feasible in New Zealand, and we are doing world class research,” says Professor Tyler. “I really relish working on something that I know will ultimately be useful, and provide much needed treatments.”</p>
<p>As he will explain in his upcoming inaugural lecture, when chemistry is partnered with biology, real progress can be made.</p>
<p>“I’ve worked on a number of research projects that have resulted in promising drug candidates. This includes Forodesine, which has been through several clinical trials for T-cell cancers, and Ulodesine, which has successfully completed a phase two clinical trial for gout.</p>
<p>“One of our compounds has also been shown to have efficacy against malaria. Others have demonstrated activity against the disease visceral leishmaniasis—which is a particular problem in Brazil. Another compound is in preclinical development against solid tumours, and has also shown broad activity against several types of cancer.</p>
<p>“We are looking to develop new compounds that target trypanosome parasites—parasites which are the cause of Chagas disease in central and South America, and African sleeping sickness.”</p>

<p>Professor Tyler will also talk about his research into a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, which recently received more than $850,000 in funding for its development. “Our drug candidates for Alzheimer’s disease are significantly different from others—no one else in the world is using this approach.”</p>
<p>The chemistry created during this research is now being extended into a three-year research study targeting cellular communications, supported by the Marsden Fund.</p>
<p>A Victoria graduate for his Bachelor’s degree and PhD, Professor Tyler joined the University in 2014 when the Ferrier Research Institute was formed. Prior to that, he worked as a scientist at Callaghan Innovation, and the former Industrial Research Limited and Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.</p>
<p>When: 6pm, Tuesday 4 October</p>
<p>Where: Lecture Theatre KKLT301, Level 3, Kirk Building, Kelburn Campus, Victoria University of Wellington</p>
<p>RSVP: Before Friday 30 September. Email <a href="mailto:rsvp@vuw.ac.nz">rsvp@vuw.ac.nz</a> with ‘Tyler’ in the subject line or phone 04-463 7458</p>
