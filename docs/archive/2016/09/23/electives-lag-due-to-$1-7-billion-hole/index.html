<p>Dr David Clark<br>MP for Dunedin North<br>Associate Health Spokesperson</p>
<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>23 September 2016</p>
<p>Electives lag due to $1.7 billion hole</p>
<p>The lag in hip and knee replacements is a direct consequence of the Government’s $1.7 billion underfunding of health, says Labour’s Associate Health spokesperson Dr David Clark.</p>
<p>“A comprehensive study by the University of Otago says that the rate of elective knee and hip surgery is simply not keeping up with population growth.</p>
<p>“The problem is that per head of population, surgery rates have decreased by 0.6 per cent. Jonathan Coleman has to face the music and answer questions about funding.</p>
<p>“If the Government doesn’t do something the problem is going to become even more acute as our population continues to age.</p>
<p>“In the past year data from District Health Boards shows that nearly 45,000 Kiwis were sent back to their GPs without getting to see specialists they were referred to.</p>
<p>“The Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch DHBs have the worst access to publically funded joint replacement. Dunedin and Hamilton are not far behind.</p>
<p>“Only a Labour-led Government will fund health properly, so that New Zealanders can get the healthcare they deserve,” says Dr David Clark.</p>
