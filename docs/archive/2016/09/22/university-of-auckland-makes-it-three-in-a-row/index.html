<p>22 September 2016</p>
<p>The University of Auckland is again ranked as the leading university in New Zealand in the 2016-17 Times Higher Education World University Rankings.</p>
<p>The University was placed joint 165th out of 980 international institutions, up from 172nd last year.</p>
<p>The University is the only New Zealand University to feature in the top 200, and to be among the top eight universities in Oceania.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the University was 81st the QS World University Rankings, the only New Zealand university to be ranked in the top 100.</p>
<p>The University was also ranked as the most innovative in New Zealand and Australia in the inaugural Reuters Top 75: Asia’s Most Innovative Universities rankings in August. Auckland was placed 27th, ahead of the leading Australian universities. No other New Zealand university featured in the top 75.</p>
<p>“We are pleased with these results over the course of this year and we do think that the high rankings internationally are something the country as a whole can be proud of,” Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stuart McCutcheon</p>
<p>“Our efforts will continue to be focused on achieving excellence in all that we do, including a focus on the University’s strengths in research and the very high quality education that we offer to New Zealanders.”</p>
<p>The Times Higher Education ranking is based on indicators taken across five sectors including teaching, research, citations, international outlook and industry income.</p>
