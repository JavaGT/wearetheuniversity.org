<p>Students choose VUWSA’s 2017 Executive  </p>
<p>At the end of every year, in Trimester 2, Victoria University of Wellington students choose who the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) executive will be for the next year.</p>
<p>This year’s no different.</p>
<p>As years progress, the new executive stand on the shoulders of those elected before them; feel a sense of pride knowing the Association they represent is now even older – and that they’ll contribute to its history. They’ll help make Victoria’s students’ lives better.</p>
<p>This year’s executive are no different, and neither will the executive of 2017.</p>
<p>Every year the executive adapt to new environments, knowing what was needed back in 1899 when the Association first opened its doors, is different from what’s needed today.</p>
<p>‘This year’s executive and I went into the year with big plans, and built a stronger, more engaged Association,’ says Jonathan Gee, VUWSA’s 2016 President.</p>
<p>‘We also set the tone of the Association for the next five years by finalising a Strategic Plan – reaffirming that the reason we exist is to get the best deal for students.’</p>
<p>As one of the oldest and largest student Association’s in New Zealand, VUWSA’s ideology of students helping students has stood the test of time.</p>
<p>‘Being a VUWSA executive is a big responsibility. I’d like to congratulate the newly-elected 2017 Executive. You will very soon be representing thousands of students, and I know from experience this is a very fulfilling thing.’</p>
