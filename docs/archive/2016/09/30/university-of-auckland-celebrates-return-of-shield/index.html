<p>University of Auckland Sports Manager Albie Eaton and Sports Officer Tracey Spray receive the University &amp; Tertiary Sport New Zealand (UTSNZ) Shield.</p>
<p>The University of Auckland is officially the highest point scorer in sporting tournaments in 2016 and has claimed the coveted ‘Shield’.</p>
<p>Continuing a 93-year-old tradition, the University was awarded the University &amp; Tertiary Sport New Zealand (UTSNZ) Shield at the weekend. </p>
<p>The ‘Shield’, as it is known amongst students, elicits fierce rivalry among universities.</p>
<p>It is presented to the tertiary provider with the greatest combined points from UTSNZ sporting events and championships held throughout the year.</p>
<p>A celebratory parade will be held at the University of Auckland on Friday 14 October, when students will have the opportunity to have their photo taken with the Shield.</p>
<p>Plans have also begun for the Shield to go on a nationwide tour of New Zealand universities later this year.</p>
<p>The Shield was particularly sought after this year as it has not been awarded for the past five years, since Student Union membership became voluntary and the viability of inter-tertiary sporting tournaments declined.</p>
<p>The Shield was reinstated by the new University and Tertiary Sport New Zealand body this year.</p>
<p>UTSNZ was set up in 2016 by New Zealand University Vice-Chancellors to re-establish competitive sport pathways and inter-tertiary competition for student athletes.</p>
<p> “The University is very proud of our students’ preparation, commitment and determination to win back the Shield in this new format inter-tertiary sporting competition,” says University of Auckland Director of Sport Louis Rattray.</p>
<p>“The standard of competition throughout has been excellent and shows students and universities value the new competitive format being provided by UTSNZ. I would like to thank UTSNZ and the national and regional sporting bodies who have helped make this year’s tournament a success.”</p>
<p>The holder of the 2016 shield was decided after the final two championships, hockey and netball, were held in Wellington and Auckland respectively last weekend.</p>
<p>The University of Auckland was presented with the shield at the conclusion of the National Tertiary Netball Championships, held at the Auckland Netball Centre, when a final tally of points could be calculated.</p>
