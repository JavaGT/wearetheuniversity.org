<p><strong>UC researcher aims to 3D-print synthetic wood</strong></p>
<p>A University of Canterbury researcher has won Government funding to explore the potential of 3D-printing live plant cells (bio-printing) to create synthetic wood.</p>
<p>Associate Professor David Leung is working on creating a new, sustainable industry for synthetic wood manufacture through 3D bio-printing live plant cells that could vastly reduce the need for tree harvesting.</p>
<p>If successful the project, which will receive $255,000 over three years, would give the New Zealand manufacturing sector a new, sustainable biomaterial that goes a long way to realise the potential of 3D printing.</p>
<p>Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce has today announced the University of Canterbury researcher’s 3D bio-printing project as one of 10 ambitious seed projects to develop disruptive technology for industry, to be funded with $826,000 in 2016 from the Science for Technological Innovation (SfTI) National Science Challenge.</p>
<p>UC Biotechnology expert Assoc Prof Leung’s project - <em>Enabling sustainable economic development with advanced additive manufacturing of wood</em> - contains huge economic potential in harnessing the enabling 3D-printing technology in product manufacturing.</p>
<p>“Although challenging, there is potential to use live cells as an advanced manufacturing material in a yet-to-be invented, new industry,” Assoc Prof Leung says.</p>

<p>The principle of 3D-printing live plant cells (bio-printing) has recently been demonstrated with live green algal cells.</p>
<p>“It is possible that other types of plant cells, such as the wood-forming cells of eucalyptus trees, could be used as bio-printing materials. Hence, it is a potential, socially acceptable opportunity for sustainable economic development derived from native forests.”</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to manufacture a wood product (a non-living 3D structure) without the need for the destructive harvesting of trees.</p>
<p>“Live eucalyptus tree cells will be prepared specifically for bio-printing. They will be physiologically primed in a 3D structure in the biotech lab at the University of Canterbury, without any genetic modification, to be capable of responding to the appropriate triggers for transformation into a principal wood cell called a tracheid,” Assoc Prof Leung says.</p>
<p>“The changes in the cells will be studied in relation to the characteristic morphological features and chemical properties of tracheids using various microscopic, histochemical staining and fluorescence techniques.”</p>
<p>If successful this research would be among the most significant scientific advances towards the realisation of the full potential of 3D printing. The manufacturing sector would have a new, sustainable and advanced biomaterial for developing niche products in a New Zealand context.</p>
