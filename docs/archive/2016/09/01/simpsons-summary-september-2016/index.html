<p>It’s been another busy month working hard for the Coromandel.</p>
<p><em>Scott Simpson<br>MP for Coromandel</em></p>
<p>It’s been another busy month working hard for the Coromandel. During my travels around the electorate I’ve had a really positive response to the announcement of the Government’s initiative to set an ambitious goal for a Predator-Free New Zealand (PFNZ) by 2050.</p>
<p>While the task is ambitious, I think setting the goal and then working toward it is something well worth doing. The Coromandel already has many community led organisations working toward conservation goals. This existing expertise gives us the opportunity to become a centre of innovation and an earlier leader in eradicating predators.</p>
<p>It will be our part of the country that has the most to gain from becoming predator free sooner rather than later. I can’t wait to be rid of the rats, stoats and possums that do so much damage to our beautiful native flora and fauna.</p>
<p><strong>Hekia Parata visit</strong></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of welcoming Hekia Parata, the Minister of Education, to our wonderful electorate last month. While Hekia was in the Coromandel, we hosted several meetings to discuss education in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Our first meeting was at Thames High School with members of the Thames Community of Learning. These communities are schools who have come together to raise achievement. This is possible because improved connections allow teachers to support one another by sharing skills and expertise when needed. It’s terrific to see how our education professionals are coming together to give our students the best possible learning environment.</p>

<p>Next, there was a meeting of women in Thames. Hekia spoke about her life and how her experiences have given her an understanding of the social dynamics that affect learning. After, there was an opportunity for questions from the audience; overall the meeting was very engaging and enjoyable.</p>
<p>Later we visited Hikutaia Primary School and Hekia was really impressed to see a real rural school. It was also great to hear some of the tales from a school that has been around for 137 years. After our visit we moved on to Paeroa College where we were welcomed by an amazing haka, the passion and skill of the students was absolutely fantastic.</p>
<p>Our last stop was Agrisea in Paeroa. The company produce seaweed products for agriculture and horticulture plus a wide range of skin care products. When my colleagues visit the Coromandel I always enjoy showing them the incredibly innovative businesses that make our area special.</p>
<p><strong>Katikati Transport Meeting</strong></p>
<p>In early August I invited Transport Minister Simon Bridges and NZ Transport Agency officials to a meeting of Katikati residents to discuss roading issues in and around the township. Although planned a couple of months ago, the meeting took place against the shadow of the tragic deaths of five local Tongan kiwifruit pack house workers earlier in the week. It was a robust meeting but an important meeting.</p>
<p>Last month I circulated a postcard survey to Katikati letterboxes asking whether or not people wanted a bypass. The response was overwhelmingly in favour of a by-pass, but there are still many issues that need to be resolved and worked through. One thing very clear at the public meeting was that a simple by-pass through the main shopping area of Katikati township will do little if anything to solve the wider traffic issues to the north or south.</p>
<p>The public meeting was one step in an on-going process and I remain committed to achieving a satisfying outcome for Katikati. All this is of course on top of the $520m already committed to roading safety improvements between Waihi and Tauranga.</p>
<p><strong>Local Amateur Theatre Scene</strong></p>
<p><em>Scott with the Coromandel Players</em></p>
<p>One of the more fun aspects of my job involves getting out and about in our communities, which includes supporting local theatrical productions. I really enjoy watching and interacting with the fabulously talented performers in our area. These productions are run by volunteers who are passionate about putting on a good show.</p>
<p>This year I’ve attended terrific shows in Coromandel Town, Tairua, Te Aroha and Thames. On top of providing excellent entertainment, these groups help raise funds for local charities. If you want a really good night out and some quality local entertainment do get along and support these wonderful community theatre groups.</p>
<p><strong>Community Feature - Paeroa Community Meals</strong></p>
<p>I’d like to highlight a terrific local initiative by the Paeroa Elim Church. Every fortnight the church hosts a Friday dinner for the community, particularly those who are socially disadvantaged and isolated.</p>
<p>According to Pastor Cliff Kershaw, it was Gerry Sampson’s vision and initiative that was the inspiration for the regular dinner. Gerry’s husband Harry, who’s an ex-army chef, does most of the cooking. On the evening I visited a fantastic traditional roast dinner with dessert was served.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes there are many volunteers who give their time to ensure the initiative runs smoothly. Most of the food is donated by local businesses or individuals with more than the occasional anonymous donation of money from people in the community.</p>
<p>Community meals are not just for those struggling, people from all walks of life are invited to sit down and enjoy a good meal with others. It’s a wholesome meal and an act of kindness by a group of locals who care for their community.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p><strong>Scott Simpson</strong><br>MP for Coromandel</p>
