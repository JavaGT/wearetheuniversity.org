<p><strong>Wednesday, 14 September 2016, 9:16 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>14 SEPTEMBER 2016  </p>
<p><strong>No New Parliamentary Building for Us</strong></p>
<p>Claims that Opposition parties are keen on a new parliamentary building are simply not true, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“We are also concerned that the confidentiality of meetings about the parliamentary precinct has been broken,” says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First was approached to sign up to National’s project for a new building to replace Bowen House. We made it very clear we would not.</p>
<p>“In October last year New Zealand First met Parliamentary Services. In December we had a follow-up meeting with the Speaker David Carter and Leader of the House Gerry Brownlee.</p>
<p>“These meetings were on a confidential basis. However, that confidentiality has been broken by statements in the media that Opposition parties are keen on the new building, which we are not.”</p>
<p>“The National Party has made a series of decision making blunders about the parliamentary precinct:</p>
<p>• Not using the largest wooden building in the Southern Hemisphere for a parliamentary purpose (the Victoria University law school)</p>
<p>• Privatising the ownership of Bowen House, which has come back to bite this government.</p>
<p>“Now the Speaker says ‘Parliament should own its own premises’.</p>
<p>“That is not what his party was saying in October 1998 when it set out to privatise the ownership of Bowen House.</p>

<p>“So it seems that the Speaker has had an 11th hour epiphany.</p>
<p>“The same goes for other parliamentarians who want out of leasing Bowen House, which costs the taxpayer nearly $6 million a year. As usual the taxpayer is being hit hard by the decision of National to sell state assets.</p>
<p>“However, at a time when there are well over 40,000 Kiwis homeless, and young Kiwis struggling to buy a home, it ill behoves parliamentarians to consider their own comforts.</p>
<p>“The fact is we don’t need 120 parliamentarians, 100 would be sufficient, at which time we would have plenty of room.</p>
<p>“Former Prime Minister Keith Holyoake used to have five people in his office - Prime Minister John Key has 55. Before anyone starts screaming about the need for more space let’s take a look at how bloated the system now is,” says Mr Peters.</p>
