<p><strong>Local Body Elections</strong></p>
<p>I encourage you to take part and vote in the Local Body elections. Every household in Auckland pays rates, and our local councillors and local board representatives take on the responsibility of allocating this money to benefit everyone in the community.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://newzealandnationalparty.cmail20.com/t/i-l-kdjhpk-jrhhlhjlu-r/">Click here</a></strong> to find out more about your local Papakura candidates and the mayoral candidates. You have until 8 October to cast your vote.</p>

<p>Another way of engaging with Local Body elections is through Massey University’s design and democracy project**<a href="http://newzealandnationalparty.cmail20.com/t/i-l-kdjhpk-jrhhlhjlu-j/">www.votelocal.nz</a>**. It&#39;s an online tool designed to help you decide who you could vote for, and helps inform users about the role of Councils.</p>

<p>To make things even easier, instead of posting your vote, you can drop your vote into your local library’s ballot box untilnoon on Saturday 8 October 2016.</p>
<p>We have 18 mayoral candidates across Auckland and 27 candidates for the Counties Manukau DHB.</p>

<p>Best wishes to all the Local Body candidates and thanks to all of you who take the time to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Police Remembrance Day</strong></p>
<p>Thursday 29 September is Police Remembrance day. It is the feast day of the Archangel Michael, the patron saint of Police, and gives us an opportunity to pay tribute to police officers who have been killed on duty and remember Police staff who have died in the past year.</p>
<p>The roll of honour dates back to 1886 when records began and the remembrance service is held at the Royal New Zealand Police College in Porirua.</p>
<p>Police officers, staff, and members of the public are been wearing the Police Remembrance Day Pin which was developed by New Zealand Police and the Police Association. The design of the pin incorporates the Police chevron into the Huia tail feather, the wearing of which is considered by Māori to be a great honour. The design of the pin symbolises the honouring of someone special, now lost to the Police.</p>
<p>Members of the public wishing to purchase a pin can enquire at their local police station. Any donations towards the pin will go to the Police Families Charitable Trust for the families of New Zealand Police officers who have been killed while carrying out their police duties.</p>
<p><strong>Huia e! Huia tangata kotahi. He tōtara kua hinga.<br>The feather of the huia, for someone special. One dearly departed.</strong></p>
<p>Best wishes to you,</p>
<p><strong>Hon Judith Collins</strong><br>MP for Papakura</p>
