<p>The New Zealand Youth Choir</p>
<p>They brought their audience tears and won all categories at an international singing competition. Last week the New Zealand Youth Choir was recognised again with a prestigious University of Auckland Blues Award.</p>
<p>The 11 members of the choir who attend the University of Auckland won the Most Meritorious Performance in Arts category at the annual Blues Awards on Tuesday September 22.</p>
<p>A University Blue is the highest accolade to be earned at a Tertiary level, traditionally awarded for excellence in a sporting code, however the University of Auckland also recognises Arts and Service and Leadership.  </p>
<p>The New Zealand Youth Choir travelled to the Czech Republic earlier this year to compete at the 24th Annual International Festival of Academic Choirs.</p>
<p>In a clean sweep, they won all categories - mixed choirs, art song of a particular era or style, folklore of the choir&#39;s nation and spiritual/gospel/jazz/pop – as well as the Grand Prix and a special prize for outstanding vocal culture. Their performance of Waerenga-a-Hika brought judges and audience members to tears.</p>
<p>“It was a chance to take New Zealand music overseas,” said choir member Benjamin Tan. “We also made it to Notre-Dame in Paris, France, where there were a lot of kiwis, university alumni, choir alumni and we could all emotionally reconnect through the experience.”</p>
<p>Choir member Natasha Wilson added: “We had a karanga (traditional call) gifted to the choir and we utilised it as you just don’t hear that overseas. People really embraced it and appreciated it.”</p>
<p>The University of Auckland choir members were Bianca Davidson, Ella Ewen, Grace Sturgess, Natasha Wilson, Manese Latu, Peng Seng Benjamin Tan, Hyun Young Park, Samuel Downes, Sophia Ritchie, Amy Chun-I Chang and Jack Timmings.</p>
<p>The choir extended special thanks to the University for its support, in particular conductor David Squire, and vocal coach Dr Morag Atchison and Choirs Aotearoa New Zealand&#39;s Artistic Director Associate Professor Karen Grylls, both from the Faculty of Creative Arts and Industries.</p>
<p>The Blues Awards are part of a tradition from England, where the blue colours of Oxford and Cambridge Universities came to symbolise sporting excellence. While a Blues Award has traditionally been a sporting accolade, the University of Auckland also recognises Arts and Service and Leadership.  </p>
<p>In total 152 awards will be bestowed at the event, hosted by Mike McRoberts from TV3. Students will be recognised for a wide range of pursuits from Kapa Haka and poetry, to the card game bridge and the sport of polocrosse.</p>
