<p><strong>Universities New Zealand - Media release</strong></p>
<p><strong>EMBARGOED until 5am Thursday 29 September 2016</strong></p>
<p><strong>Productivity Commission Report still far from presenting a compelling vision</strong></p>
<p>University Vice-Chancellors are currently carefully considering the Productivity Commission’s 400-page report on new models of tertiary education says Chris Whelan, Executive Director of Universities New Zealand.</p>
<p>He says the report has picked up some of the sector’s concerns and makes some sensible suggestions for enhancement.</p>
<p>“At the same time, we also have some concerns about the lack of in-depth analysis and evidence provided in the report to support many of the conclusions and recommendations. We are also concerned that the Commission has failed to fully consider some of the evidence provided in the submissions received.</p>
<p>“Our key concern is that this draft report does not yet provide a vision for a coherent and connected tertiary education system.</p>
<p>“This inquiry is of critical importance as it could inform the design - and success – of New Zealand’s tertiary education system. Any decisions the Government might consider will impact our workforce, our economy and the lives of young New Zealanders who go onto apprenticeships, polytechnics or universities or those needing to retrain in the future. So it’s vital that as a nation, we get it right.”</p>
<p>Universities New Zealand is looking forward to ongoing consultation with the Commission, and Government, about the recommendations.</p>
