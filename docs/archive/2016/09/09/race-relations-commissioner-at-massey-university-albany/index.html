<p><strong>Race Relations Commissioner at Massey University, Albany, Auckland<br>20 September for annual Peace Talk</strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;We just need to look around the world right now to see what happens when racial intolerance and racism is normalised. We think New Zealanders are better than that...&quot;</em></p>
<p>The public is invited to hear Dame Susan Devoy speak on the new Human Rights Commission initiative #ThatsUs, a digital platform for collecting stories of migration and experiences of racism in New Zealand.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Many people don’t think racial intolerance or racism is a problem: often because they do not experience it themselves. By raising the voices of those New Zealanders who face racial intolerance in their everyday life: we’re hoping other New Zealanders will take the time to listen. We suspect many of us don’t realise when something we say is unfair or biased: but we would if someone pointed it out to us.&quot;</em> - Dame Susan Devoy</p>
<p>Hear Dame Susan speak to this issue and have your opportunity to participate in the conversation during Question &amp; Response.</p>
<p>12 PM Tuesday, 20 September 2016</p>
<p>Massey University&#39;s Atrium Bldg, Albany Expressway</p>
