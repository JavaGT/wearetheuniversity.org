<p>Kevin Hague to leave Parliament</p>
<p>Green MP Kevin Hague is to leave Parliament to take up a new role as CEO of Forest and Bird.</p>
<p>“Kevin has made a huge contribution to the Green Party and the green movement and we are truly sorry he is leaving Parliament,” said Green Party Co-Leader Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>“Kevin has been an excellent advocate for Green policies over many years. He has worked tirelessly and effectively, for the Green Party and with other political parties. We will miss his passion and his wisdom,” said James Shaw.</p>
<p>“Kevin’s achievements in parliament include championing accountability and workplace health and safety in the wake of the Pike River disaster, forcing culture change at ACC, helping establish Nga Haerenga the New Zealand Cycle Trail, and successful campaigns for marriage equality and to save the Mokihinui River.”</p>
<p>&quot;While we are sorry to lose Kevin from Parliament at the same time we are delighted Kevin will continue his contribution to the environment at Forest and Bird. We know he will be a fantastic leader for this New Zealand icon,” said Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>With Kevin’s resignation, Barry Coates will come into Parliament as the next person on the Green Party list.</p>
<p>“Barry brings extensive experience in social justice, climate change and Pacific work, including ten years as Executive Director of Oxfam New Zealand. He will be an important new voice in Parliament and we look forward to working with him,” said Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>Barry Coates also brings business and management experience, as well as governance roles with Fairtrade Australia NZ and the Council for International Development. He is currently working on trade issues, and is developing a sustainability programme at the University of Auckland Business School.</p>
