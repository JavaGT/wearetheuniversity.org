<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>5 September 2016</p>
<p>Get real Mr Woodhouse: Review immigration properly</p>
<p>Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse is treating New Zealanders like fools with his phoney review, Labour’s Immigration spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway says.</p>
<p>“There needs to be a full review of the immigration system, not, as Mr Woodhouse is suggesting, a bogus review where the outcome has already been decided.</p>
<p>“Does Michael Woodhouse really think people will be fooled by this? Kiwis are cleverer than he thinks they are and will see right through this sham.</p>
<p>“National has broken our immigration system. The problems are everywhere - in education, with tertiary fraud and the exploitation of overseas students; in the labour market, with thousands of work visas issued for jobs such as café manager and hairdresser while thousands of New Zealanders are unemployed; and in housing.</p>
<p>“MBIE, Treasury and the Reserve Bank have all expressed concern and the Government is well aware of the risks of doing nothing.</p>
<p>“However given Mr Woodhouse’s preconceived outcome of a review, that’s probably all we can expect.</p>
<p>“Labour supports active management of immigration to make sure New Zealand gets the skills it needs and that migrants are able to settle well,” says Iain Lees-Galloway.</p>
