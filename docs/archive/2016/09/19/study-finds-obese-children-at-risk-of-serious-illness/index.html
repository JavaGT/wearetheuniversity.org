<p>A unique New Zealand study has found that obese children are showing signs from a young age that they are at risk of developing serious weight-related problems, such as Type 2 diabetes, heart, and liver disease.</p>
<p>It is the first study to show the prevalence of these risk factors in obese New Zealand children.</p>
<p>The study gives a snapshot of the health and wellbeing of a group of obese children in Taranaki. Over 200 children and teenagers aged 4 to 16 years took part in a 12-month intervention programme called Whānau Pakari, which involved regular home visits from a health professional.</p>
<p>Whānau Pakari means “Healthy self-assured whānau who are fully active”. The programme involves support from a multi-disciplinary team of health professionals to help participants make healthy lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>When the tamariki entered the programme, they had medical tests and physical assessments for disease markers – signs they could be on their way to developing weight-related problems.</p>
<p>Researchers found:</p>
<ul>
<li>75 percent had signs of inflammation, increasing long-term heart disease risk</li>
<li>40 percent had physical signs of high risk for Type 2 diabetes</li>
<li>47 percent had at least one abnormal liver function test</li>
<li>11 percent had abnormal blood pressure</li>
<li>50 percent snored four or more nights a week, and breathing pauses during sleep had been witnessed in 20 per cent – both suggestive of obstructive sleep apnoea.</li>
</ul>
<p>“We knew these findings were likely to be present in these children given previous studies in other countries,” says Dr Yvonne Anderson, a paediatrician and co-author of the study.</p>
<p>“What was concerning was how common they were from a young age.”</p>
<p>Children as young as five had risk factors for Type 2 Diabetes and signs suggestive of obstructive sleep apnoea.</p>

<p>“These children are not just carrying a bit of extra weight - they also have health indicators that can be life-limiting if left unaddressed,” says Dr Anderson.</p>
<p>There were surprisingly few differences between Māori and Pakeha children in terms of risk for weight-related illness.</p>
<p>“However, Māori and those most deprived are over-represented in child obesity statistics throughout New Zealand, and we need to reach these whānau and support their journey to better health and wellbeing,” Dr Anderson says.</p>
<p>Nationally, an estimated 85,000 children aged 2-14 years are obese, and about 4,500 in Taranaki, according to latest New Zealand Health Survey.</p>
<p>“Obesity is everyone’s problem and we all need to be part of the solution,” says Dr Anderson. “If we are going to make a difference to those most affected by obesity, services that they feel comfortable with, and that fit in with their lives, are key.”</p>
<p>Taranaki’s Whānau Pakari programme included one-to-one family support, group sessions, physical fitness checks and fun weekly activity sessions, such as cooking sessions, physical activity and virtual supermarket tours.</p>
<p>Whānau received advice and support from a dietitian, psychologist, physical activity advisor, and a healthy lifestyles co-ordinator as well as doctors.</p>
<p>The study was a collaboration between Taranaki District Health Board, Sport Taranaki, and the Liggins Institute, with funding from the Health Research Council.</p>
<p>The study was published in the Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health.</p>
