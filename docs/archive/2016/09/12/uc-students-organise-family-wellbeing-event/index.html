<p>UC students organise family wellbeing event</p>
<p>University of Canterbury students are promoting mental health as a ‘resource for life’ through a weekend amble in the Botanic Gardens.</p>
<p>The third annual All Right? Amble, organised by UC Bachelor of Health Sciences (Health Education) students, hits the Botanic Gardens on 2 October, as part of The Breeze Walking Festival 2016.</p>
<p>A health-focused family event organised by the BHSc students, led by Health Education lecturer Tracy Clelland of the School of Health Sciences, the fun family-friendly walk is part treasure hunt, part orienteering walk with a difference. Walkers can pick up a map from the Botanic Garden Visitors Centre anytime between 10am and 1.30pm to scout out the journey’s hidden delights and spend quality time with family and friends.</p>
<p>There will be a range of activities to join, such as flax weaving, skipping, drawing, and plenty of fun surprises. The aim is to connect people across five interactive stations, which illustrate the five ways to well-being: connect, take notice, keep learning, be active, and give.</p>
<p>Over 450 people joined in the All Right? Amble in 2015. Clelland says the focus of the event is to encourage people to stop and take time out.</p>
<p>“Have a walk around the Gardens, think about your own well-being and reflect on how you can utilise the five ways of well-being to enhance your mental health and family relationships,” she says.</p>

<p>“Mental health is a resource for life and we all need to nurture it.”</p>
<p>The activity stations along the 2km walk are based on the five ways to wellbeing. At each station a range of activities reflect simple ways of improving mental health, Clelland says. The five ways to wellbeing are:</p>
<p>Keep learning: Learning new things will make you more confident as well as being fun. Seek out new experiences and dare yourself.</p>
<p>Take notice: Be curious and catch sight of the beautiful, remark on the unusual. Notice the changing seasons. Try savouring the moment, whether you are walking to work, eating lunch or talking to friends. Be aware of the world around you and what you are feeling. Reflecting on your experiences will help you appreciate what matters to you.</p>
<p>Give: Do something nice for a friend, or a stranger. Thank someone, smile, or volunteer your time by joining a community group. Seeing yourself, and your happiness, linked to the wider community can be incredibly rewarding and creates connection with the people around you. It feels good to give and everybody has something to offer. How will you play your part?</p>
<p>Connect: You can connect in so many ways. Connect with the people around you, such as your whanau/family, friends, colleagues and neighbours. Connect at home, work, school, or in your local community. Think of these relationships as the cornerstone of your life and invest time in developing them. Building these connections will support and enrich you every day.</p>
<p>Be active: Step outside, when was the last time you went for a bike ride, a jog or a walk in the fresh air? You could try playing a game or dancing with young ones. Check out your garden. Pulling some weeds or planting something new can help you work up a sweat. Exercising makes you feel good. Discover a physical activity you enjoy and one that suits your level of mobility and fitness. Do what you can, enjoy what you do, be active and move your mood.</p>
<p>All Right? Amble, Sunday 2 October, 10am – 2pm. Collect a stamp at each point and return your map for a prize! Collect your map at Botanic Gardens Visitor Centre, Armagh Street Car Park, Hagley Park, approx distance: 2km. The event is now on Facebook.</p>
