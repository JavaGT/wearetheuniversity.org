<p>Professor Andrew Hill</p>
<p>Internationally recognised surgeon and perioperative care specialist, Professor Andrew Hill, is this year’s recipient of the Gluckman Medal for his outstanding contributions to research, education and service.</p>
<p>The Gluckman Medal is the premier acknowledgement of excellence, awarded each year by the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences at the University of Auckland.  The official award ceremony is held in November.</p>
<p>Professor Hill has established an internationally recognised research group in perioperative care at Counties Manukau Health (CMH).</p>
<p>He is the Head of the South Auckland Clinical Campus of the University of Auckland and has significantly increased the size and influence of this Campus during his six-year tenure.</p>
<p>Professor Hill has transformed its role from a teaching site to a significant research site, and he is working with CMH to build a research institute to enable the Counties Manukau District Health Board, in partnership with the University, to play a major role in clinical research.</p>
<p>He has supervised 20 post-graduate students and one of these, Dr Tarik Sammour, won a University of Auckland Best Doctoral Thesis Award in 2012. Professor Hill’s students have won more than 30 prizes or scholarships for their research regionally and internationally.</p>
<p>He has also mentored seven Māori or Pacific junior doctors in research towards a PhD and was awarded the 2016 RACS Māori Medal for this work.</p>
<p>Among many awards accorded, Professor Hill was awarded the 2014 University of Auckland Teaching Excellence Award for Research Supervision and the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS) premier research award, the John Mitchell Crouch Research Fellowship.</p>
<p>Professor Hill has more than 200 peer-reviewed papers with a focus on Medical Education and Perioperative Care. He also is a Reviewer for 30 journals including the <em>British Medical Journal, The Lancet, Medical Education, British Journal of Surgery</em> and <em>Annals of Surgery.</em></p>
<p>In 2007 Professor Hill was awarded the Butland Award for Excellence in Medical Education Leadership, and in 2011 he was awarded a Doctor of Education from the University of Auckland for teaching junior doctors how to teach medical students.</p>
<p>Professor Hill also plays a key role in Australasian surgical research leadership as the immediate past chair of the RACS Board of Surgical Research, responsible for disbursing nearly $2 million in research funding, and he is the Head of the ANZ Surgical Research Society.</p>
<p>His service to surgical research includes as an elected RACS Councillor and chair of the Research, Audit and Academic Surgery committee.</p>
<p>At CMH, he also serves on the Clinical Heads Group and is the Clinical Lead for Research.</p>
<p>Professor Hill is an elected Councillor on the Executive Committee of the International Surgical Society, the oldest international surgical association in the world.</p>
<p><strong>The official award of the Gluckman Medal to Professor Hill, followed by his lecture and a lunch, will be on Wednesday 23 November at 12 noon in Lecture Theatre 505-007, at the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, at 85 Park Road in Grafton.</strong></p>
