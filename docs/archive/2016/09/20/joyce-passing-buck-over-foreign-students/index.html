<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>20 SEPTEMBER 2016  </p>
<p><strong>Joyce Passing Buck Over Foreign Students</strong></p>
<p>Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce only has his eyes on the dollars and is not interested in regulating New Zealand’s international student industry, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“Thousands of international students are arriving here with false visas and all Mr Joyce is saying – it’s not our responsibility, it’s the education businesses.</p>
<p>“He’s happy for the National government to take millions of dollars from the industry but won’t police it; instead he says a code of practice is being drawn up to make providers responsible for the behaviour of agents.</p>
<p>“It is a classic case of passing the buck, and what happens if the education providers are as bad as the crooked agents?</p>
<p>“It is a well-established fact, New Zealand is at the low end of the international student education market and is being used by most foreign students as a fast track, not to gain a higher education, but to get permanent residency.</p>
<p>“All Mr Joyce is worried about is not disrupting the flow of students to this country, regardless of how shonky the whole business is,” Mr Peters says.</p>
