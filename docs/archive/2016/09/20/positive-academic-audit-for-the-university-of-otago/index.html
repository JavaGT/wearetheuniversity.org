<p>Positive Academic Audit for the University of Otago</p>
<p>An Academic Audit undertaken by the University of Otago this year has validated the importance it places on promoting student engagement with their study and learning, the residential college experience, and the pursuit of teaching excellence.</p>
<p>The University was audited by the Academic Quality Agency for New Zealand Universities (AQA).</p>
<p>The audit follows the methodology used for all New Zealand universities in the fifth cycle of academic audits. It focuses on teaching and learning, and student support.</p>
<p>The Academic Audit Report demonstrates that the University of Otago is performing well across the academic activities and areas reviewed by the Panel.</p>
<p>The University of Otago considers the report a positive endorsement of its direction.</p>
<p>University of Otago Vice-Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne is extremely pleased with the outcome. “The Academic Audit report confirms that Otago is providing a very high standard of student support, and that we have a positive teaching and learning framework that is underpinned by quality decision-making processes.”</p>
<p>“The report clearly shows Otago supports a culture of teaching excellence. This culture is something in which I take great pride. On behalf of the University of Otago, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of our academic and professional staff for their commitment to providing such an outstanding learning environment for our students,” she says.</p>
<p>The Panel considered that the University is characterised by its research intensity, the role that residential colleges play in the student experience and the importance of both academic and personal development of its graduates.</p>
<p>The Panel was impressed by the University’s clear strategic framework and the way in which its approach to devolved decision-making is understood and valued across the University. It also commended the University for recognising that all developments should be supported by data and research.</p>
<p>The Academic Audit Report contains 12 commendations, 7 affirmations and 6 recommendations.</p>
<p>Recommendations for improvements, some of which the University is already moving forward on, include further supporting students at risk of under-performance, reviewing course advice, progressing its Māori Strategic Framework, and further enhancing support for postgraduate research students.</p>
