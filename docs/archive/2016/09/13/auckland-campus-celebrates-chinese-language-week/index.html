<p><strong>Auckland campus celebrates Chinese Language Week</strong></p>
<p>Chinese calligraphy and painting, dance presentations, a Chinese language quiz and a series of films are just some of the activities planned to celebrate Chinese Language Week at Massey University’s Auckland campus this week.</p>
<p>Chinese language lecturers Dr Michael Li and Dr Liangni Sally Liu have been coordinating activities for the week, which includes a visit to the campus by the Consul General of the Chinese Embassy and Jinan University, and a day of festivities to celebrate Chinese Moon Festival on September 15.</p>
<p>“This is the first time we have celebrated Chinese Language Week on campus so extensively, and it is a fantastic way for people to gain a deeper understanding of Chinese culture,” says Dr Li.</p>
<p>In addition to screening a range of Chinese films (with English subtitles), there are presentations on Chinese calligraphy and painting, Chinese culture and tips for interacting with Chinese students, and dance and music performances. All events will be held in the Library, with movies shown in the mini theatre on Level 1, and the quiz and seminars on Level 3.</p>
<p>Massey University students are also invited to enter the Chinese language quiz in the Library, with a range of exciting prizes on offer, including iPads, Apple watches and Samsung Gear VR. “In addition to these amazing prizes, we’ve also got a free trip to China to win, so we hope our students will get involved and bring their best language skills to the quiz, says Dr Li.</p>

<p>On Thursday a gift of Chinese language books from Jinan University will be donated to Massey University and schools from across the Auckland region. “We are very grateful for this donation of books which will help our students develop the skills for reading Chinese for pleasure,” says Dr Liu.</p>
<p>&quot;As a growing economic powerhouse, to understand contemporary China and have the communication skills in Chinese language can provide great opportunity to expand one&#39;s career horizon. The 21st century is a momentum for China as well as many Asian countries to vigorously engage in global economy, politics and governance. To understand one of the fastest growing economies - China is important for being a citizen of the 21st century,&quot; she says.</p>
