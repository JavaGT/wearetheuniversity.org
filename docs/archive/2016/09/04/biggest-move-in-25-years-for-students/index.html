<p>3 SEPTEMBER 2016  </p>
<p><strong>Biggest Move in 25 Years for Students</strong></p>
<p>Students will repay taxpayers for their tertiary education through “time worked” under a New Zealand First proposal, says Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“Students would still have a debt to their country but we would shift this to a debt of their time and skills – they will use their talents to repay their country’s investment in their education.</p>
<p>“A year worked in New Zealand will reduce the skill debt by a year.</p>
<p>“It’s time to change the mindset from a financial debt to a skill debt to your country.</p>
<p>“We cannot continue to load students up with financial debt. It is unsustainable. The financial, social and personal cost is too high.</p>
<p>“This fits with our existing policy of debt write off for those spending five years in the regions working in critical skill shortage areas.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First will put much of the tertiary education focus on workforce planning, career advice and competitive course entry.</p>
<p>“We can cut education costs by over a billion dollars by fitting the education of each person to the requirements of the workplace.</p>
<p>“Students will compete to get into courses, to ensure a better fit between the student and the field of study.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First will also widen the apprenticeship scheme to include non-traditional areas, such as truck driving which will minimise skill shortages and unemployment rates.</p>
<p>In addition we will:</p>
<p>facilitate short term internship/work experience, during and after school years;</p>
<p>pay the Job Seekers Benefit to approved employers when taking on an apprentice;</p>
<p>use bonding system models for certain industries e.g. teachers, nurses, doctors, police etc;</p>
<p>introduce a universal living allowance which is not subject to parental means testing as a priority for all full-time students;</p>
<p>repeal recent amendments to the Social Services Act which shut out full time students from accessing the accommodation supplement.</p>
