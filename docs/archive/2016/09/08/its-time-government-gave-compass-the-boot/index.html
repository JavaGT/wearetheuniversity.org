<p>8 SEPTEMBER 2016  </p>
<p>It’s Time Government Gave Compass the Boot</p>
<p>New Zealand First is once again calling on the government to sever ties with the foreign-owned Compass Group following news their 15 year hospital food service contract had to be renegotiated, after signing up just six of the country’s 20 DHBs.</p>
<p>“The Compass contract has been a disaster for southern residents and now we know it won’t even deliver on its cost-cutting promise,” says New Zealand First List MP based in Invercargill, Ria Bond.</p>
<p>“The minister has known since earlier this year about the serious shortfalls with the Compass contracts, not just in the quality of food being served but also in cost cutting, and has chosen to push this company on DHBs in spite of these results.</p>
<p>“This contract was supposed to cut costs to the tune of $190m, but if only six of 20 DHBs sign up, obviously those savings are never going to be realised.</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine any DHB would sign up to Compass Group at this point after what we’ve seen in Southland and Otago.</p>
<p>“The government needs to stop meddling in local issues and start supporting local services and cut Compass loose”, says Ms Bond.</p>
