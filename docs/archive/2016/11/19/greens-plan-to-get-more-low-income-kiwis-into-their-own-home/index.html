<p><strong>Green Party launches plan to get more low-income Kiwis into their own home</strong></p>
<p>Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei has today launched a <a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/home-for-life">progressive ownership plan</a> to provide up to 10,000 new homes for lower-income Kiwis to own, and to <a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/home-for-life">empower community housing groups</a> with new financing models to help fix the housing crisis.</p>
<p>The plan was launched at the Habitat for Humanity conference in Rotorua, and builds on the Green Party’s Home for Life policy, which was first launched before the last election.</p>
<p>“Our Home for Life plan is about giving more New Zealanders a fair shot at owning their own home – even when the market’s stacked against them,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
<p>“Building more houses that people can actually afford to buy is a critical part of solving the housing crisis.</p>
<p>“Our progressive ownership model will help to make the home ownership dream a reality for people who are locked out of the market right now because they can’t afford a deposit or a normal commercial mortgage.</p>
<p>“We’re also going to make sure the community housing sector has the finance and political support they need to drive their important work.</p>
<p>“Up to 5,000 new, energy efficient homes will also be available for the community housing sector to purchase using progressive ownership.</p>
<p>“Investors who want low-risk, socially responsible investment options, will be able to use their money to help fix the housing crisis – they’ll be able to buy into the building of thousands of affordable houses for Kiwis who need them.</p>
<p>“The Green Party will empower the community housing sector to play a big part in ending the housing crisis, with low-interest loans funded by housing bonds.</p>
<p>“Community housing providers, including iwi, have the skills, experience, and expertise to help more New Zealanders into homes and we will work with them to develop new models of housing for New Zealand,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
