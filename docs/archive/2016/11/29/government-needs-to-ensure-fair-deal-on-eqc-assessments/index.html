<p><strong>Government needs to ensure fair deal on EQC assessments</strong></p>
<p>Kiwis affected by earthquakes might not get a fair deal if the Government pushes ahead with secret plans to let private insurers take over the assessment of claims, says Labour’s Canterbury spokesperson Megan Woods.</p>
<p>“Under questioning from Labour the Government has admitted that they’re in discussions to privatise a core function of EQC to decide how much a claim is worth, giving that function to the very businesses who have to pay out those claims.</p>
<p>“Labour doesn’t have a problem with insurance companies playing a role, but giving them the ability to define the value of claims creates a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>“EQC currently pays for all claims under $100,000 and insurance companies pick up the tab for amounts over this cap. This new process may incentivise insurance companies to keep claims below $100,000 and avoid paying out as much as they should.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to see the potential for people affected by earthquakes to miss out on a fair payment.</p>
<p>“EQC’s responsibility is for homes damaged by earthquakes to be assessed fairly. The Government is walking away from this responsibility.</p>
<p>“The Government should be on the side of people but once again are putting the interests of business before people.</p>
<p>“John Key must come clean about their privatisation agenda and provide assurances that this will be a transparent process with the appropriate protections and public oversight of public money,” says Dr Woods.</p>
