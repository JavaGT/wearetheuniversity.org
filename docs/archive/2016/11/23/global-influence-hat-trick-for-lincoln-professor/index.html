<p>Global influence hat trick for Lincoln professor  </p>
<p>Lincoln University Professor of Plant Biosecurity Philip Hulme has been named on the annual list of Highly Cited Researchers for the third year running. Every year, over 1000 scientific publications refer to Professor Hulme’s research.</p>
<p>Professor Hulme is one of only nine New Zealand-based researchers to make the Thomson Reuters 2016 list that includes the world’s most influential science minds.</p>
<p>“It is pleasing to see Phil included on this list of global influencers. His research is of national and international significance and has been used by policymakers worldwide. We are privileged to have him on our team,” says Professor Travis Glare, Director of the Bio-Protection Research Centre, a Centre of Research Excellence hosted at Lincoln.</p>
<p>Professor Hulme has expertise in biosecurity and the effects of invasive species on human health, agriculture and the environment. His research supports the development of policies to prevent or mitigate the damage posed by invasive plants, animals and pathogens. He led the development of new standards that have been adopted by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>
<p>“New Zealand represents the cutting-edge of biosecurity science and policy and such a stimulating environment has allowed me to develop innovative science that has been well received internationally,” says Professor Hulme.</p>
<p>As a member of the Biosecurity Ministerial Advisory Committee and a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand, Professor Hulme has made significant contributions to the Biosecurity 2025 strategy recently launched by the New Zealand Government. The strategy will transform the way we protect New Zealand from pests, weeds and diseases over the next decade.</p>
<p>The Highly Cited list names nearly 3,000 leading researchers that are making the most valuable and significant contributions in science and social science research around the world. It recognises research publications that rank among the top 1% most cited works for their subject field and year of publication between 2004-2014.</p>
