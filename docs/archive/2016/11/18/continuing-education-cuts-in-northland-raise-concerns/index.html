<p><strong>Continuing Education Cuts in Northland Raise Concerns</strong></p>
<p>Another tertiary institution is being brought to its knees, thanks to the government’s ongoing funding cuts to the education sector, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“Whangarei-based polytechnic North Tech is set to lose $2.3 million in funding for programmes crucial for young people who leave school with few qualifications, and second-chance learners,” says New Zealand First Education spokesperson Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“This comes the same week as The Design School in Whangarei announced it could close this year after having its funding slashed.</p>
<p>“The National Government is deliberately allowing public education to run down, in favour of private education in which profits are pursued over educational standards.</p>
<p>“The Government cutting funding to Level 1 &amp; 2 courses in Northland, for example, ignores the systematic lack of investment in education for this region and its young people.</p>
<p>“The time to trim back these courses is when regional need has been identified, not when Wellington’s data stats are flat-lining across the country.</p>
<p>“This government appears to have no concern for the viability of public provision as they struggle to compete against private entities making a profit from the public purse in a &quot;bums on seats&quot; environment.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First&#39;s Up Front Investment Tertiary Policy would ensure that the right skills for New Zealand&#39;s future would be fully supported across the country with recognised regional input,” says Ms Martin.</p>
