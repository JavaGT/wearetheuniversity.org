<p><strong>Enough is Enough – Time for a Review</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/hamilton-news/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503366&objectid=11753565">letter written by orthopaedic surgeons to Waikato District Health Board</a>proves enough is enough and New Zealand First is calling for an independent review of the whole health system and its funding.</p>
<p>“Health targets imposed by the government have had a negative impact on the system,” says New Zealand First Health Spokesperson Barbara Stewart.</p>
<p>“Patients are missing out on follow-up appointments just so targets can be met. It’s not good enough.</p>
<p>“Many doctors and health professionals are speaking out but the government is ignoring them, preferring instead to rely on false target information.</p>
<p>“The reality is, the targets are downright dangerous and patient safety is at stake. How much more evidence does the Minister need?</p>
<p>“The letter even states that ‘Waikato Hospital is no longer a safe place to practice elective surgery’. This comes after news that Waikato Hospital was in danger of receiving a fine having not met their targets.</p>
<p>“It’s time for a review to fix the mess caused by National’s failed health policies,” says Mrs Stewart.</p>
