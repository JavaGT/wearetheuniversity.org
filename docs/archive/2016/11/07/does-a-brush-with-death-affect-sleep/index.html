<p><strong>Monday, November 7, 2016</strong><br><strong>Does a brush with death affect sleep?</strong></p>
<p>A Massey University psychologist is seeking participants for a study on people who have had a brush with death to find out how the experience has affected their sleep.</p>
<p>Dr Natasha Tassell-Matamua, who specialises in near-death experiences, is seeking 200 people aged 18 and over who have had a close shave with death – or a near-death incident– to find out more about whether this has changed their sleeping patterns, for better or worse.</p>
<p>Dr Tassell-Matamua, from the School of Psychology, says there is anecdotal evidence that people who’ve been on death’s doorstep – whether through illness or accidents – experience changes to sleep. But little is known about whether people need less sleep, whether their quality of sleep is affected and how their quality of life changes.</p>
<p>After a near-death incident, she says “sometimes people report a decreased need for sleep, while others report an increased need. Some people may also report difficulty with falling or staying asleep and or insomnia.”</p>
<p>In particular, she wants to compare the results of people who have had a near-death incident, with those who’ve also had what is known as a near-death experience, which can accompany, but is not integral to, a brush with death. It involves intense psychological or spiritual effects that can trigger profound and long-lasting changes in a person’s priorities and perspectives.</p>
<p>A near-death experience “might be a situation where you were dead or close to death, but still felt something significant happened during this time,” she says. “Some people report leaving their physical body; moving through a tunnel; seeing a bright light; having a life review; meeting with deceased relatives or spiritual beings; among other features. This experience may cause significant and fundamental life changes, including a change in sleep quality.”</p>

<p>Some people may experience the first – a near-death incident – without having a near-death experience. She hopes people from both groups will come forward to take part in the study.</p>
<p>Dr Tassell-Matamua says examining sleep patterns across the two groups will provide a better understanding of the impacts on sleep specifically, and people’s perspectives on life.</p>
<p>Part of her interest in doing the study is based on the documented therapeutic value for people in learning about what a near-death experience entails, and the impact it can have on someone’s frame of mind – even if they have not actually experienced it themselves.</p>
<p>Dr Tassell-Matamua is an international researcher into the psychology of near-death experiences and with sociologist Dr Mary Murray, undertook the first major research on people’s accounts of near-death experiences in New Zealand. She is also supervising a number of master’s and doctoral research projects into the phenomenon.</p>
<p>The online survey takes 15 to 20 minutes. Participants who complete the questionnaire can enter a prize draw to win one of ten $50 MTA vouchers to acknowledge their time in contributing to the research.</p>
