<p><strong>Sunday, 6 November 2016, 2:30 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Labour offers hope for young people out of work</strong></p>
<p>Labour will get young people not in education, training or employment, working in our communities, says Leader of the Opposition Andrew Little.</p>
<p>“A Labour Government will provide hope to the 74,000 young people not in employment, education or training by offering them meaningful work for six months. We will help the younger generation get the work experience they need so they will be better prepared to re-enter the work force.”</p>
<p>Andrew Little made the Ready for Work announcement at today’s Labour Party Conference in Auckland.</p>
<p>“It’s a fact that young people are more likely to be unemployed for a longer period. National has stood by and let tens of thousands of young people languish on the Job Seekers benefit.</p>
<p>“There are now 10,000 more unemployed people aged under 24 than a decade ago. This is an incredible waste of potential. Labour will not abandon them.</p>
<p>“Young people who have been on the Jobseeker’s Allowance in the Work Ready category for six months will be offered full-time employment for six months at the minimum wage. Mentors will assist with training and prepare them for work.</p>
<p>“We will give these young Kiwis the kick start they need to get back on the right track. This job experience will help them develop strong work ethics and make them more attractive to employers. We will get them ready for work.</p>
<p>“They will be carrying out important environmental and community work. Right now the Department of Conservation is struggling to meet its goals in the face of funding and staff cuts. Councils and others are also crying out for help.</p>

<p>“With an estimated 10,000 taking part each year, the Ready for Work scheme will cost $60m a year. This will result in large savings to the Government over time. It’s an investment we need to make for our young and for society.”</p>
<p>Ready for Work is part of a comprehensive plan for young New Zealanders which includes three years free post-secondary education, entrepreneur grants and Dole for Apprenticeships.</p>
<p>“We want a future where every young New Zealander is earning a living or studying towards a career,” says Andrew Little.</p>
