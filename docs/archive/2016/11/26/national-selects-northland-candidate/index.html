<p>National selects Northland candidate</p>
<p>Matt King has been selected by National to contest the Northland electorate at the 2017 General Election.<br>Mr King has lived in Northland most of his life. He is a farmer, fraud investigator, volunteer firefighter with the Okaihau Brigade, and was previously a NZ Police Detective.</p>
<p>“I’m a proud Northland boy who has always called this place home, so it’s a thrill to be chosen. Now I’m looking forward to hitting the campaign trail and earning the right to be the strong, local voice Northlanders deserve,” Mr King says.<br>“I’ve been a tradesman, a police officer, a farmer and a businessman. Whether you’re running a small business in Kerikeri, farming in Kaeo or showing visitors around in a stunning spot like the Bay of Islands, I know our local communities and their needs well.</p>
<p>“This is a part of New Zealand that has it all – stunning natural environment, fertile land, good schools, successful businesses, and a strong community spirit.</p>
<p>“Northland is a more prosperous place under this John Key-led National Government. Our economy is growing with more local jobs, we’re improving vital infrastructure, and investing in better social services.</p>
<p>“I’m the only candidate who will be a strong local MP, based in Northland, in a Government that gets results.”</p>
<p>Northland is New Zealand’s northernmost electorate, stretching from Cape Reinga down to Wellsford excluding the area around Whangarei. It includes the towns of Kerikeri, Kaikohe, Kaitaia, and Dargaville.  </p>
