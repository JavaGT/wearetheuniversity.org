<p><strong>LARGE-SCALE EMERGENCIES DESERVE URGENT LEGISLATIVE ATTENTION</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is concerned that the government is too slow with its promised legislation that will address large-scale emergences, such as Monday’s earthquakes.</p>
<p>A Bill which focussed on a smoother transition from response to recovery for small to moderate emergencies went through Parliament last week and is awaiting Royal Assent.</p>
<p>“This Bill was always pitched by the National government as a part one of a two-part process,” says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Civil Defence and Emergency Issues Clayton Mitchell.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First has made it clear at every stage that the first stage needed to be put through the House under urgency and implemented as soon as practicably possible.</p>
<p>“The Minister finally conceded yesterday that he would be moving the implementation date of the Bill forward with New Zealand First support.</p>
<p>“The second stage of the legislative review should be focussing on large-scale emergencies and will be closely aligned with the review of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011.</p>
<p>“Mr Brownlee has been unable to assure us that stage two of this review dealing with major civil defence emergencies would have legislation in Parliament soon.</p>
<p>“The government is failing New Zealanders by not advancing legislation that will protect them during large-scale emergencies despite recent major events and ever increasing seismic activity impacting on our country.”</p>
