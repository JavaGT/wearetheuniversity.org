<p>Universities awarded 92.5% of Marsden research funding</p>
<p>3 November 2016</p>
<p>Universities New Zealand congratulates all researchers awarded grants in this year’s Marsden Funding, which supports New Zealand’s best investigator-initiated research in science, engineering, maths, social sciences and the humanities.</p>
<p>Universities were awarded 108 of the 117 project grants, and 92.5% of the $65.2 million research funding announced today.</p>
<p>Chris Whelan, Executive Director of Universities New Zealand, says, “The results confirm the high quality of the researchers and research being carried out in New Zealand’s universities, as well as the high-quality teaching being delivered.</p>
<p>“Their research helps to change and improve lives, to understand and manage our environment, grow our knowledge, and contributes to New Zealand’s economic growth.</p>
<p>“Our research is highly regarded around the world and many larger countries want to work with our researchers. We also know that university research is relevant as it is being commercialised, generating over $500 million each year.”</p>
<p>Chris Whelan acknowledged the increase to Marsden funding in Budget 2016. He also acknowledged increased support for earlier career researchers, with more Fast-Start grants awarded.</p>
<p>The grants are distributed over three years, paying for salaries, students and postdoctoral positions, institutional overheads and research consumables.</p>
