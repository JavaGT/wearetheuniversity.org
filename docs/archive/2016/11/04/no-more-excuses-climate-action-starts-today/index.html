<p>No more excuses – climate action starts today  </p>
<p>The Paris Climate Agreement coming into force is a triumph for ordinary people around New Zealand and the world who have demanded politicians take action to stop climate change, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>The Paris Climate Agreement will come into force today after crossing the threshold of at least 55 countries, responsible for 55 percent of global emissions, joining the agreement.</p>
<p>“Around the world there’s a real desire for action on climate change, and I think we’ve seen that shift here in New Zealand,&quot; said Green Party Co-leader James Shaw.</p>
<p>“In the last few years thousands of New Zealanders have marched in the streets, petitioned the Government, and demanded real action on climate change.</p>
<p>“The National Government is slowly beginning to wake-up to the urgency, and also the opportunity, climate change presents – but now we need to see real evidence that they have a strong plan to actually reduce our emissions.</p>
<p>“National needs a rethink of its economic strategy to fit with the new climate reality. Carbon emissions have increased 19 percent since National took power.</p>
<p>“Tackling climate change represents a huge opportunity for New Zealand. It’s a chance to invest in electric public transport, build healthier, and more energy-efficient homes, and shift to more sustainable forms of agriculture,&quot; said Mr Shaw.</p>
