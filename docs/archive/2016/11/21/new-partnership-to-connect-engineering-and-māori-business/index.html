<p>The Faculty of Engineering at the University of Auckland is pleased to announce a partnership with the Federation of Māori Authorities (FOMA) to foster closer ties between leading engineering researchers and Māori enterprises.</p>
<p>Deputy Dean of Engineering Professor Margaret Hyland said that the Faculty had much to learn from working with Māori and the knowledge and expertise within the Faculty could also be of significant benefit to FOMA members.</p>
<p>The partnership was a valuable opportunity to work more closely with Māori business and enterprise.</p>
<p>“We have much to learn from the Māori world, so that closer relationships through initiatives such as this help ensure both Māori and non- Māori students and academic staff are exposed to this part of our economy and our nation’s unique indigenous insights and world view,” she said.</p>
<p>Professor Hyland said Māori success is New Zealand’s success. Developing rangatahi (young people) who can contribute to this success was important.</p>
<p>“In areas such as nanotechnology, robotics and materials engineering we have much to offer Māori organisations and enterprises that are looking to increase opportunities to ensure the best return on their assets,” she said.</p>
<p>FOMA Chairman Traci Houpapa said the relationship with the University would form an important strategic partnership in years to come. It would ensure that Māori enterprises had access to some of the best and brightest engineers and scientists in the country.</p>
<p>The Faculty of Engineering has established a team of engineers and researchers who will be able to meet with FOMA members in their rohe (tribal areas).</p>
<p>Ms Houpapa has been invited by the Faculty to make a presentation tomorrow to help cement the relationship and consider next steps.</p>
