<p>Victoria University of Wellington scientists have featured on the cover of a leading international journal with an image of bacteria grown in the shape of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Research by Dr Jeremy Owen, Dr Mark Calcott, Dr Katherine Robins and Associate Professor David Ackerley from Victoria’s School of Biological Sciences, published in _Cell Chemical Biology,_investigates the potential of engineering improved antibiotics.</p>
<p>Dr Owen says antibiotic resistance is a serious problem that is steadily getting worse.</p>
<p>“We’re faced with going back to the 1920s pre-antibiotic era where the most innocuous of wounds could potentially kill you if they became infected. This is something that everybody is going to be vulnerable to.”</p>
<p>The research outlines the possible re-engineering of the enzymatic assembly lines that make antibiotics.</p>
<p>“By re-engineering assembly lines we could get them to make interesting derivatives that can get around bacterial resistance mechanisms,” says Associate Professor Ackerley.</p>
<p>“The standard approach is to take apart and re-assemble the modules that make up the assembly lines. Nature has achieved this millions of times, but it doesn&#39;t generally work well in the lab.</p>
<p>“We took the same starting approach, but then added an additional step of mimicking evolution by introducing millions of small mutations and selecting the assembly lines that now worked best.”</p>

<p>Dr Robins says the research team looked for any hint of activity when making the mutations.</p>
<p>“If there’s activity, which may only be one time in a thousand times, it can be enough for evolution to start some selective pressure, so it evolves to make more and more.</p>
<p>“We modelled this using two enzymatic systems that each produce a different brightly coloured product. This allowed us to visually track improvements in our evolved and re-engineered enzymes.”</p>
<p>The changes in colour inspired Dr Calcott to construct bacteria in the shape of New Zealand in a petri dish.</p>
<p>“Our two different enzymatic systems were in two different bacteria, and one makes a blue pigment while the other makes a yellow-green pigment,” says Dr Calcott.</p>
<p>“I grew the green bacteria in the shape of New Zealand, sitting in an ocean of the blue bacteria, which <em>Cell Chemical Biology</em> decided to use for its November cover page. It’s pretty exciting to make the cover of such a good journal.”</p>
