<p><strong>Media Release</strong></p>

<p><strong>Doocey reselected for 2017 Election</strong></p>
<p>Matt Doocey MP has been reselected by National to contest the Waimakariri electorate at the 2017 General Election.</p>
<p>&quot;I’m a proud National MP who shares the National Government’s understanding of the importance of a strong economy and rewarding hard work,” Mr Doocey says.</p>
<p>Stretching from North Christchurch to North Canterbury encompassing suburbs including Belfast and Northwood, the towns of Kaiapoi, Rangiora and Oxford, the Waimakariri electorate is a high-growth area that mixes urban and rural communities. Mr Doocey was first elected in 2014 and increased National’s Party Vote to over 20,700.</p>
<p>“Whether you’re raising a family, on a farm, or working in one of the great businesses here, the National Government is backing our hard-working local communities to create jobs and support families,” Mr Doocey says.</p>
<p>“We’ve stood steadfast by Canterbury in the recovery phase following the quakes, we’re helping manufacturers and small businesses grow, and we’re making real improvements to important local services like roads and schools.</p>
<p>“My first term has been a time of exciting growth and progress for Waimakariri. A time of openings, milestones and new beginnings that began with the reopening of our Oxford and Rangiora Town Halls, the new Ashley Bridge on Cones Road, the opening of the Ruataniwha Kaiapoi Civic Centre, Enterprise North Canterbury’s new flagship building, the Conway Lane development, our new Health Hub and our new Farmers’ building.</p>
<p>“The Waimakariri electorate has benefited from National’s sensible economic management and track record of getting things done on your behalf.</p>
<p>“I’ll be running a strong campaign to ensure Waimakariri keeps its strong voice in the stable John Key National-led Government that has delivered a clear plan for New Zealand’s future.”  </p>
