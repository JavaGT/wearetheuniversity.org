<p>Media Release</p>
<p>21 November 2016</p>
<p>Local businessman National’s Wigram candidate</p>
<p>Canterbury businessman David Hiatt has been selected by National to contest the Wigram electorate at the 2017 General Election.</p>
<p>Mr Hiatt, a fifth-generation Cantabrian, runs an award-winning local tourism business ‘Canterbury Guiding Co.’ and is involved in several community organisations. This will be his first time contesting an election.</p>
<p>“I’m really thrilled to be selected and look forward to hitting the campaign trail to give Wigram voters a strong voice in a National-led Government that delivers results,” Mr Hiatt says.</p>
<p>Currently held by the Labour Party, Wigram is located in South-West Christchurch. National has increased and won the party vote in both the 2011 and 2014 General Elections.</p>
<p>“Suburbs in this area like Barrington, Riccarton and Hornby are really vibrant places to live, work and play. Despite challenging times following the devastating earthquakes, Wigram is making great progress,” Mr Hiatt says.</p>
<p>“National has a proud record of backing the region in the recovery phase, and we’re now focused on supporting Cantabrians with the next steps of redevelopment and growth.</p>
<p>“As a successful businessman, a father, and a community advocate, I know what our suburbs need to lock in the gains of the last few years.</p>
<p>“Wigram has benefited from National’s sensible economic management and track record of getting things done for families and businesses.</p>
<p>“I’ll be running a strong campaign to ensure Wigram has a dedicated local voice in a National-led Government that has delivered for New Zealand and has a clear plan for the future.”</p>
