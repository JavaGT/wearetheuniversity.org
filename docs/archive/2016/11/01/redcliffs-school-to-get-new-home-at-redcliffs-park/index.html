<p>Media statement</p>
<p>1 November 2016</p>
<p>Redcliffs School to get new home at Redcliffs Park</p>
<p>Redcliffs School now has a clear future which will give the staff and students certainty, and enable them to look forward to a new and larger site, says Nuk Korako, List MP based in Port Hills</p>
<p>“The Minister carefully considered all the analysis and concluded that moving the school away from the original site is the best option for the school and its community,” Mr Korako said.</p>
<p>“Every option was carefully considered. It has been clear from the beginning of my engagement with the board and community that the school site was important to the teachers, students, and community.</p>
<p>“But at the front of the Minister’s mind were the potential psychosocial effects on the children. The investigation found that although the risk of negative psychosocial impacts could be mitigated for most children, this would place additional responsibilities on staff to implement mitigation measures if the school remained on the site, and this cannot be guaranteed by the Ministry of Education or the current board in the long term.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, we whole-heartedly believe relocating the school to the nearby Redcliffs Park will be best for the entire community.</p>
<p>“Moving to Redcliffs Park will also mean the school will have a larger site, allowing it room to grow and the potential to share community facilities.</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge the school board, the teachers, the students, the parents, and the Redcliffs community. This has been a long road, and I am glad that the community now has certainty and can plan for their new home,” Mr Korako said.</p>
<p>Analysis will now be undertaken on Redcliffs Park to find the best site for the school. Redcliffs School will continue sharing the site at Van Asch Deaf Education Centre until the new site is ready, which will likely be by mid-2019.</p>
