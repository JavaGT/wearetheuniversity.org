<p>Art lovers will be able to immerse themselves in innovative contemporary art at the Elam Grad Show, taking place over two days at the end of this month.</p>
<p>The annual event is a weekend-long art exhibition comprising the work of more than 130 graduating students from Elam School of Fine Arts at the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>Traditionally thousands of visitors attend the exhibition, which attracts prospective students, artists, curators, collectors, and the curious, to three art-filled venues across the University’s City Campus.</p>
<p>This year visitors will be treated to a diverse range of artworks created by BFA, BFA(Hons), PGDipFA and MFA students including painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, installation, moving image, performance and new media.</p>
<p>“The Elam Graduate Show is our big chance to show the wider arts community what we do here at the Art School,&quot; says Elam Head of School, Associate Professor Peter Shand.</p>
<p>“Graduating students are presenting work that provides an exciting insight into contemporary art practice, and points to the many directions it might take in the future. The ambition, intellectual reach, material richness and communicative strength of their work is impressive and bodes well for the future of art and creativity in New Zealand,” he says.  </p>
<p>“I am sure that a number of this year’s graduates will go on to forge significant careers in a range of creative fields both at home and overseas. It is very clear from the work of our students why Elam is the country’s most prestigious art school.”</p>
<p>Elam School of Fine Arts is also launching a new on-line project that will record graduates’ achievements and provides a permanent, searchable archive for researchers and all those interested in contemporary art.</p>
<p>The Elam Grad Show takes place from 10am-4pm, Saturday 26th &amp; Sunday 27th November, Elam School of Fine Arts, the University of Auckland.</p>
