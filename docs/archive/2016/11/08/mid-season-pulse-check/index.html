<p><strong>Mid-season pulse check</strong></p>
<p>Owl Farm’s final Farm Focus Day of 2016 takes place on 16 November. “As usual we have a great calibre of speakers on hand to share progress to date, and to look towards the future,” says Farm Demonstration Manager Doug Dibley.</p>
<p>“Although it’s been a pretty wet and bleak start to the dairy season with the continuous rain we’ve received, there has been a silver lining seen through the slow recovery of the global markets. This renewed confidence has seen Fonterra twice increase their forecast farm gate milk price. We have Matt Bolger of Fonterra coming to share with us where they see things heading in the next 12 to 18 months and what we can expect as a result.”</p>
<p>New Health and Safety legislation also means changes are afoot around identifying risks and communicating various controls to manage those risks for contractors and visitors on farm. With the use of a new health and safety app, ‘OnSide’ communicating these risks is going to be easy. Health and safety consultant Steve Sharpe from Sharpe People Solutions will be on farm to discuss how this works and how Owl Farm will be using it.</p>
<p>Following these two sessions, the focus will return to Owl Farm’s performance through the opening part of the season. There will be the opportunity to discuss the plan for navigating summer, and trying to reduce post peak decline. Doug says a financial snapshot of how the farm is tracking through the season to date will be provided. “Well then move to the paddock where we’ll talk about farm performance, with a particular focus on milk production and pasture quality. To finish this session we have DairyNZ discussing how to manage pasture quality over the summer months.”</p>
<p>Owl Farm Focus Days are for farm owners, farm workers and rural professionals to meet, network and share ideas. Join Doug and industry members on 16 November to find out more about</p>
