<p><strong>Investing in Education And Working for Business</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First agrees with MYOB that the Tertiary Education structure is not meeting the needs of the majority of New Zealand small business owners.</p>
<p>“This is one of the reasons we developed our Up Front Investment Tertiary Education Policy,” says Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“Along with great workforce planning, professionalising the Careers and Transition services, and other levers, the policy builds on the Business Linked Internship Scheme that partners students directly with business.</p>
<p>“This means the education of graduates would be more closely connected to business practice and real life skills.</p>
<p>“At a time when we have a large number of young New Zealanders struggling to find employment, while there is record immigration, it is time to accept that the government’s hands-off actions are creating a lose-lose environment for graduates and businesses.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First has a win-win solution that not only removes any future debt burden from our graduates but supports small business owners to gain the skilled staff they need while future proofing the employment talent pool for business.”</p>
