<p>Call for paramedics to be regulated to reduce risk of harm</p>
<p>“Paramedics in New Zealand should be regulated, to ensure they are clinically competent and to protect the safety of the public,” says Dr Andrew Swain, Associate Professor in Paramedicine at Auckland University of Technology (AUT).</p>
<p>At present, anyone can claim to be a paramedic or establish an ambulance service.</p>
<p>Dr Swain says The Health Practitioners Competence Assurance (HPCA) Act should be extended to paramedics.</p>
<p>The HPCA Act already regulates the practice of 22 health professions in New Zealand – ranging from optometry and dentistry to nursing and medicine – with the relevant authorities acting as watchdogs regarding qualifications, competency and complaints.</p>
<p>Conversely, the absence of registration can make it difficult for skilled paramedics to operate outside their sphere of activity or work internationally.</p>
<p>The renewed call for regulation comes in the wake of a 7.5 magnitude earthquake near Hanmer Springs.</p>
<p>Dr Swain recalls that, during the Christchurch earthquake in 2011, a specific court order was required to allow New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) medics to treat civilians.</p>
<p>These same medics are deemed ‘unacceptable’ by some nations for relief and aid missions without additional credentials.</p>
<p>Registered paramedics can be operational immediately.</p>
<p>Paramedics are registered in several countries, including the UK and South Africa.</p>
<p>In Australia, paramedics are moving towards inclusion in the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme (NRAS) under the Australian Health Practitioners Regulation Authority (AHPRA).</p>

<p>In New Zealand, an application for paramedics to be regulated under the HPCA Act is being reviewed by the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>“The proficiency criteria for UK paramedics has been assumed by ambulance services in New Zealand. But, registration would allow this to be formalised and monitored,” says Dr Swain.</p>
<p>If paramedics pose the risk of harm, their registration could be suspended or revoked – preventing them from relocating and seeking new employment unchecked.</p>
<p>Over the past 20 years, ambulance services have undergone a dramatic shift, from providing emergency transport to delivering advanced medical care.</p>
<p>Invasive procedures and administering controlled drugs, which were once the preserve of doctors, now fall with paramedics.</p>
<p>“The role of paramedics will continue to expand in response to increasing demands on our healthcare system,” says Dr Swain.</p>
<p>Ambulance paramedics care for more than 450,000 medical and trauma patients in New Zealand each year.</p>
<p>The Paramedics Australasia International Conference will be held at AUT on November 17-19.</p>
<p>Paramedics Australasia has advocated for the national registration of paramedics for many years.</p>
