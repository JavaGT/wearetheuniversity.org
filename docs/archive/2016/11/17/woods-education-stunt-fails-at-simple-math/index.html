<p><strong>Dr Parmjeet Parmar MP</strong><br><strong>National Party candidate for Mt Roskill</strong></p>
<p><strong>Media Release</strong></p>
<p>17 November 2016</p>
<p><strong>Wood’s education stunt fails at simple math</strong></p>
<p>National Party candidate for the Mt Roskill by-election Parmjeet Parmar is calling her opponent out for using incorrect figures and spreading misinformation.</p>
<p>“Today’s press release by Mr Wood is nothing more than a misguided political stunt,” Dr Parmar says.</p>
<p>“In his release, Mr Wood tries to claim the Government is reducing funding to most schools in Mt Roskill when the opposite is true.</p>
<p>“The Government has increased operation grant funding for schools by 1 per cent this year, which is more than double the current rate of inflation of 0.4 per cent. This funding is being targeted to those students most at risk of under achieving.</p>
<p>“All schools in Mt Roskill will receive a share of this funding based on the number of students they have that met the criteria. Waikowhai School, the school where Mr Wood is chair of the Board of Trustees, is getting an increase of 1.25 per cent, which is more than what his school would have received had the Government simply increased funding by 1 per cent across the board.</p>
<p>“Once again Mr Wood is playing fast and loose with the truth,” Dr Parmar says.</p>
