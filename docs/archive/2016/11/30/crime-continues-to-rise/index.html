<p>Stuart Nash<br>MP for Napier<br>Police Spokesperson</p>
<p>30 November 2016</p>
<p>Crime continues to rise</p>
<p>Overall crime is up five per cent and the Government just doesn’t seem to care, says Labour’s Police Spokesperson Stuart Nash.</p>
<p>“The latest crime statistics show some staggering results throughout the country while the Minister continues to play down rising crime and ignoring the pressures this is placing on our Police.</p>
<p>“It appears Minister Collins is losing her grip on her portfolio as her reaction in Parliament to the increased meth use questions was nothing but patronising and weak.</p>
<p>“The new results are stunning. Assault crime is up a shocking nine percent including a 27 percent spike in Auckland’s Counties Manukau district.</p>
<p>“Sexual assaults have increased throughout the country by a horrible 4 percent with a 21 percent increase in Auckland.</p>
<p>“Robbery and related offences have risen 18 percent including a 41 percent rise in Canterbury and a massive 64 percent rise in Tasman.</p>
<p>“Burglary is up 18 percent including a 38 percent rise in Tasman and a 31 percent rise in the Eastern District.</p>
<p>“The fact the Minister continues to downplay crime shows she’s not across her portfolio which is about keeping our people safe.</p>
<p>“The Minister must also admit she made a mistake when she signed off on the Police’s four year strategy which froze police numbers.</p>
<p>“Labour is committed to making our communities safer by providing a thousand more police in our first term,” says Stuart Nash.</p>
