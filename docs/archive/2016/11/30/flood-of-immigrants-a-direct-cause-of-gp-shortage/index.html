<p><strong>Flood of Immigrants a Direct Cause of GP Shortage</strong></p>
<p>Kiwis are <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/health/news/article.cfm?c_id=204&objectid=11757125">struggling to find a GP</a> because of the government’s excessive immigration and gross under-funding of the health sector, says New Zealand First Health Spokesperson Barbara Stewart.</p>
<p>“It’s common sense - the more people you have, the greater the demands and stresses on the system, particularly on our under-funded health sector.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is taking in more than 70,000 permanent residents a year from overseas which is placing massive pressures on hospitals, roading, housing, schools and it has made it tougher for Kiwis to get a job.</p>
<p>“While the population has shot up, the College of GPs says the number of fulltime equivalent GPs per capita has dropped 12 percent between 1991 to 2012 and we only have 74 GPs for every 100,000 compared to 112 per 100,000 in Australia.</p>
<p>“These are the facts which no amount of spin from government can disguise.</p>
<p>“We have a health system that is failing.</p>
<p>“Every week that goes by brings another story telling us this.</p>
<p>“This litany of shame just goes on and on - DHBs reporting they cannot meet targets for cancer treatment; patients losing their sight through delays caused by long waiting lists; reports of mental health treatment being seriously under-resourced.</p>
<p>“Amazingly, in spite of this, the Minister and government say things are OK; they aren’t OK and Kiwis know it,” Mrs Stewart says.</p>
