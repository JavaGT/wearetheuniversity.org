<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>30 November 2016</p>
<p><strong>20,000 at risk students “missing”</strong></p>
<p>A briefing to the Minister of Education reveals 20,000 at-risk students can’t be found, undermining claims by Hekia Parata that a new funding model would ensure additional funding reached students identified as at-risk, says Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins.</p>
<p>“The Minister claims her new funding model will ensure at-risk kids will receive additional support, but in a briefing she received in August, the Ministry told her they were unable to find 20,000 of these students.</p>
<p>“The Minister was so concerned with the briefing she told officials she would “like to see how we can track this ‘missing’ cohort.”</p>
<p>“Another briefing states alternate education providers are unlikely to see any additional funding, despite analysis indicating 60 percent of students in alternative education meet the at-risk criteria.</p>
<p>“Over the weekend a survey revealed a quarter of principals surveyed are looking to cut support staff hours due to inadequate funding next year. This shows the new funding model was little more than a disguised cut.</p>
<p>“National is starving our schools of the funding and resources they need to succeed and that’s just not good enough.</p>
<p>“Labour will end National’s funding freeze and make sure our schools get the resources they need,” says Chris Hipkins.</p>
