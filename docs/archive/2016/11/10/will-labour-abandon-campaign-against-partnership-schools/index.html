<p>Will Labour finally abandon their campaign against partnership schools?</p>
<p>Labour needs give up on its campaign against partnership schools, says ACT Leader David Seymour, after Chris Hipkins’ bill to abolish the schools was voted down at first reading.</p>
<p>“With the definitive failure of this bill, Labour can finally abandon their union-driven campaign to close down these ground breaking, community-driven schools.</p>
<p>“Forcing partnership school students back to the system that’s let them down won’t be well-received in the communities where partnership schools are established and respected. Hipkins need only ask his fellow Labour MPs who have visited these schools in their electorates.</p>
<p>“As long as Labour clings to their anti-choice position, they won’t be able to enter Government due to opposition from communities that should be Labour strongholds.</p>
<p>“William Butler Yeats said education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. An approach that works for one student may not work for another. That’s why choice, flexibility, and innovation in education through options like partnership schools is so important.</p>
<p>“I’d like to acknowledge the Māori Party, who along with the leadership of this Government, have witnessed the achievements of communities and whanau using the partnership school model and have granted the policy enthusiastic support.”</p>
