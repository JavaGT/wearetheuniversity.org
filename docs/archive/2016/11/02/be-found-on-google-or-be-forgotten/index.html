<p>The winners of a University of Auckland competition run in collaboration with internet giant Google were praised for increasing traffic four-fold to a Warkworth-based website.</p>
<p>The Google AdWords certification programme is available free each year to University of Auckland students, with places limited and highly sought after.</p>
<p>Students from a range of study areas complete workshops on New Zealand digital media and online marketing. Participants also run a real digital media campaign, and sit the Google AdWords accreditation exam.</p>
<p>Daniel Talbot and Phoebe Joiner won the overall award for best campaign at a celebration event attended by Google and other New Zealand-based digital companies on October 13.  </p>
<p>Their campaign for Talbot Dance Academy based in Warkworth involved a website redesign and an AdWords campaign to boost the company’s presence and ranking on the search engine.  </p>
<p>“Our campaign led to a four-fold increase in site visits and a number of new enrolments,” says Daniel, whose sister runs the Talbot Dance Academy.   </p>
<p>“It worked excellently because we were given complete access to change the website as we wished. She has been really pleased with the results.”  </p>
<p>Daniel is studying a Bachelor of Arts majoring in Psychology and minoring in Drama, while Phoebe is studying a Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Commerce conjoint in Management, Marketing, Politics and International Relations and Writing Studies.  </p>
<p>This is the fourth year Google has made the AdWords Accreditation Programme available free to students in collaboration with the University’s Career Development and Employment Services division.</p>
