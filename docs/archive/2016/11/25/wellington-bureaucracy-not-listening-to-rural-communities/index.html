<p>Wellington Bureaucracy Not Listening to Earthquake-Hit Rural Communities</p>
<p>Earthquake hit rural North Canterbury are living what former US President Ronald Reagan’s described as the nine most terrifying words in the English-language: “&#39;I&#39;m from the government and I&#39;m here to help”.</p>
<p>“We’re now into the eleventh day since the earthquake and rural communities are getting frustrated by Wellington pen-pushers who can’t seem to adjust to the needs of rural folk,” says New Zealand First Deputy Leader Ron Mark.</p>
<p>“As the Rt Hon Winston Peters said the other day, Sir Jerry Mateparae would do a much better job managing the rebuild and that’s backed up by the call of my colleague Richard Prosser, who last night asked for greater New Zealand Defence Force involvement.</p>
<p>“What’s happened instead is that HMNZS Canterbury has been withdrawn because Civil Defence claims it is no longer needed. That’s despite the inland route being ropey at best and while she is not a landing ship and needs calm weather, HMNZS Canterbury can deliver hundreds of tonnes of farm supplies in one go. We need her back.</p>
<p>“While Civil Defence wrongly accords farm supplies a low priority the Army ‘got it’ - maybe because of their reconstruction experience in Afghanistan. This lack of support is creating stress as North Canterbury enters the main shear while many farms need to sow feed crops, make silage and get water reticulation up and running.</p>

<p>“There’s also faith that the local council and Army engineers can do what the New Zealand Transport Agency and its contractor seems incapable of – creating a serviceable route by whatever means necessary.</p>
<p>“The NZTA and Civil Defence aren’t helping with roads blocks many kilometres before the road becomes difficult. There’s also frustration that farmers are being looked at as 4WD novices by bureaucrats when driving on rough terrain is part and parcel of farming,” Mr Mark said.</p>
