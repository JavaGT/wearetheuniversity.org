<p>National’s Immigration Madness Continues</p>
<p>New Zealand’s reckless immigration policy continues to run amok with yet another record being set, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament, Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Statistics NZ says the October 2016 annual net gain – more arrivals than departures of migrants – reached 70,300.</p>
<p>“We have tens of thousands of young New Zealanders who can’t get a job, congested roads, a housing crisis, over-burdened hospitals and schools and yet the government persists with a madcap policy that is not working in the best interests of all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“The high level of low-skilled workers coming to New Zealand, including international students, has undermined working conditions and put a lid on wages.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First is not opposed to immigration but we believe in accepting migrants we need, and not those who need us,” says Mr Peters.</p>
<p>“It is clear that the government’s only strategy for the 2017 election is bloat the economy with consumption and perpetuate the myth that consumption growth equals real GDP per person growth.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t, and as the one political party that understands that we intend to blow their political strategy clean out of the water.”</p>
