<p>NZ climate response slammed as ‘inadequate’, again</p>
<p>Global climate experts have exposed an enormous credibility gap between the National Government&#39;s rhetoric on climate change and its actions, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s response to climate change has today been <a href="http://climateactiontracker.org/countries/newzealand.html">labelled ‘inadequate’</a> for the fourth year in a row by <a href="http://climateactiontracker.org/about.html">Climate Action Tracker</a> – an international group of climate science researchers.</p>
<p>New Zealand is ranked below the European Union, China, USA and India.</p>
<p>&quot;Climate experts are effectively calling out the National Government for greenwashing,&quot; said Green Party MP Julie Anne Genter.</p>
<p>“New Zealand has been lumped in with the likes of Saudi Arabia, the Ukraine and Russia as laggards on climate action.</p>
<p>“The report states that ‘implemented policies are highly insufficient to meet New Zealand&#39;s 2030 climate target’, and that ‘climate policies are small in scale and mitigation potential’.</p>
<p>&quot;The report shows that under current policies, New Zealand&#39;s emissions could balloon to 114 percent above 1990 levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Now more than ever, New Zealand needs to stand up for what’s right and join with countries showing leadership on climate change.</p>
<p>“That means investing in electric rail lines in Auckland rather than more motorways, and building renewable electricity generation rather than Nova’s proposed gas-power plant in south Waikato.</p>
<p>“We don&#39;t have the luxury anymore of been able to freeride on the hard work of other countries that are taking climate change seriously,” said Ms Genter.</p>
