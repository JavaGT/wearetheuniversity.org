<p><strong>Governor-General announces Rhodes Scholars for 2017</strong></p>
<p>The Governor-General has announced that the 2017 Rhodes Scholarship has been awarded to three outstanding all-round graduates, to support their post-graduate study at the University of Oxford, and to nurture them as public-spirited leaders for the world&#39;s future.</p>
<p>The Rhodes scholars for 2017 are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Lewis Fry</strong>, aged 24, is from Auckland where he studied at Kristin School. He has completed a Bachelor of Medical Science (Hons) from Monash University and is currently working on a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (Hons) to become an eye surgeon. At Oxford, he intends to undertake research toward a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil), with a particular focus on gene and stem-cell therapy for retinal degradation. He aspires to become involved in the translation of medical research to clinical practice. Lewis is a talented fast bowler and opens for Melbourne’s Monash Club; he is also an experienced tramper and keen photographer. While at Kristen School he led a team that raised $16,000 to fund and build a garden for refugees at the Mangere Refugee Centre.</p>
<p><strong>Margot Gibson</strong>, aged 22, from Christchurch. Margot attended St Margaret’s College and earlier this year graduated from the University of Canterbury with a Bachelor of Laws (Honours) and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and History. She is currently undertaking an internship with New Zealand’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Vienna. At Oxford, she will study a Master’s in Philosophy (MPhil) in International Relations, focusing on recent laws allowing states to revoke a person’s citizenship if they are suspected of travelling overseas to become a foreign fighter, and have dual citizenship. Margot is also a talented international-level athlete and has won a world cross-country championship, and was a member of the Athletics New Zealand Rio Development Squad. She also enjoys tramping and biking.</p>

He currently works as an Associate for the Boston Consulting Group in Sydney. He also volunteers for 180 Degree Consulting, the world’s largest consultancy for non-profits and social enterprises. At Oxford, Chris proposes to study for a Masters of Public Policy at the Blavatnik School of Government, focusing on the changing nature of public service provision and the future need for greater coordination between the public and private sectors to manage supply and meet policy outcomes. Chris is a talented basketballer, having played for the Saints in the national men’s league, and is also a talented guitarist.</p>
<p>In announcing the 2017 scholars, the Governor-General Rt Hon Dame Patsy Reddy, who chairs the selection panel, welcomed the opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate the leadership, scholarship and achievement of the candidates for Rhodes Scholarships.</p>
<p>“They work incredibly hard to reach the high standards expected of our Rhodes scholars. Whatever the outcome of the interview process, they have shown that they have what it takes to make a worthwhile contribution to their field of study.</p>
<p>“Together with the Panel, we warmly congratulate the 2017 scholars. We will follow their careers and progress with great interest.”</p>
<p>The Rhodes is the oldest international scholarship programme, and is awarded to up to 95 students from over 30 countries, including up to three students from New Zealand, each year. The vision, when the scholarship was established over 100 years ago, was to develop outstanding leaders with the commitment to make a positive difference, the potential to become leaders for the world’s future, and the desire to promote international peace and understanding.</p>
<p>The Scholarship covers the students’ fees, accommodation and living costs for up to three years at Oxford, which is one of the oldest and top-ranked universities in the world.</p>
<p>Applicants are required to prepared a personal statement and provide six references. The eight shortlisted candidates were identified following in-depth and wide-raging interviews held by the universities, and the final three were selected following interviews with the national selection panel.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, the application and selection process for the Rhodes Scholarships is managed by Universities New Zealand (formerly the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’ Committee), which manages over 40 scholarships worth over $2 million each year.</p>
