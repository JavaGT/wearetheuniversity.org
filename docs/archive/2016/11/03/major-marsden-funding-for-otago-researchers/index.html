<p>Major Marsden funding for Otago researchers</p>
<p>University of Otago researchers have been awarded more than $13.7M in the latest annual Marsden Fund round to undertake 23 world-class research projects that push the boundaries of knowledge in their fields.</p>
<p>The innovative Otago projects will be led by researchers from 14 different departments across the University.</p>
<p>The Marsden Fund supports excellent investigator-initiated research in science, engineering, maths, social sciences and the humanities in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Otago projects funded in the latest round include investigations ranging from exploring the origins of New Zealand’s pre-European musical instruments to studying the massive undersea volcanic eruption in the Kermadec arc that produced a 400km2 pumice raft in 2012.</p>
<p>Other projects include investigating a TB bacterium protein that may provide a new target for drugs that rapidly treat the disease, how an embryo’s genome is activated, and the neural mechanisms behind persistence and quitting behaviours.</p>
<p>Otago recipients’ projects are also focusing on the role of placental genes in cancers, using gene editing technology to study the brain’s master control of fertility, and the use of nanoparticle catalysts to remove nitrate from groundwater, among others. A full list appears below.</p>
<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research &amp; Enterprise) Professor Richard Blaikie warmly congratulated the Otago recipients on their outstanding performance in this year’s round.</p>

<p>“Our researchers’ stellar success reflects the excellence of the proposals they have put forward for this extremely competitive fund,” Professor Blaikie says.</p>
<p>The researchers represent a range of Departments including Anatomy, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geology, History, Microbiology and Immunology, Music, Theatre and Performing Arts, Pathology, Philosophy, Physiology, Psychology, Women’s and Children’s Health, and Zoology.</p>
<p>Professor Blaikie says it is very pleasing that nine of the Otago projects are ‘Fast-Start’ grants designed to support outstanding early-career researchers.</p>
<p>“From these up-and-coming researchers will come the University’s research leaders of tomorrow so it is wonderful to see their important work recognised and supported through the Fund.”</p>
<p>All 23 projects run for three years and the funding amounts are spread over this period.</p>
