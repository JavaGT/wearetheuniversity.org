<p>Homelessness crisis also an educational crisis - NZEI</p>
<p>10 October 2016</p>
<p>The NZEI is today backing calls for a national strategy to end homelessness amid mounting evidence that thousands of children who lack a warm safe home are also being denied their right to an education.</p>
<p>The Labour, Green and Māori Parties today released their report into solutions to homelessness, following a cross-party inquiry which heard from hundreds of submitters.</p>
<p>&quot;The homelessness crisis affecting thousands of New Zealand children is also an educational crisis,&quot; says Jan Tinetti, Principal of Merivale School in Tauranga and NZEI Executive member.</p>
<p>&quot;About ten percent of the children in my school are homeless, with more families coming to see me most weeks to say they&#39;re about to lose their home.</p>
<p>&quot;You can just see from looking in their eyes that these children are too tired to learn. Some of them don&#39;t have friends, and won&#39;t even try to make friends because they know they&#39;ll be moving soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Children in deprived communities like ours often start school behind children in more wealthy communities.</p>
<p>&quot;Education should be their ticket out of poverty, but if they&#39;re too tired or sick to learn they fall further and further behind. That&#39;s not just a tragedy for our children its a tragedy for the entire country,&quot; Ms Tinetti says.</p>
<p>The NZEI submitted to the inquiry, calling for the Government to join other parties in a collaborative approach to end homelessness and child poverty.</p>
<p>&quot;We support the inquiry&#39;s recommendations, including a national strategy to end homelessness, and also the recommendation to build more affordable homes,&quot; Ms Tinetti says.</p>
<p>&quot;There is growing evidence that a lack of affordable housing in Auckland, in particular is contributing to teacher shortages.</p>
<p>&quot;We applaud the Labour, Green and Maori Parties&#39; initiative in establishing the inquiry and we call on the Government to collaborate on cross-party solutions.&quot;</p>
