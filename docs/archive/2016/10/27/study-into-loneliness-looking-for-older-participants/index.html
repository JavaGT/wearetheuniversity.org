<p>Professor Merryn Gott</p>
<p>A study to improve understanding of social isolation and loneliness in New Zealand is looking for participants over the age of 65.</p>
<p>Researchers will explore why rates of loneliness in older New Zealanders are higher than many other countries and will look at the potential for visiting services to meet the needs of all older adults.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, about ten percent of people over the age of 65 are lonely, for all or most of the time with rates rising to 50 percent among those over 80.</p>
<p>A research team led by Professor Merryn Gott from the University of Auckland (in collaboration with Age Concern, who provide a national befriending service) is undertaking a Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)-funded study as part of the ‘Ageing Well’ National Science Challenge.</p>
<p>As part of the study, the research team is conducting a survey of people aged 65 or older from across New Zealand. This will involve participants completing a questionnaire at two different times over the next six months.</p>
<p>“It’s important that we gather opinions from a range of older people living in New Zealand because this information will be critical to informing MBIE and future policy makers on the ‘Ageing Well’ strategy and the provision of support services for older people in New Zealand,” says Professor Gott.</p>
<p>“International studies have shown that loneliness and social isolation are harmful to our health,” she says. “Research shows that lacking in social connections can be as damaging to our health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day or being obese.</p>
<p>“Social networks not only help to reduce the risk of mortality or the development of certain diseases (such as depression and cardiovascular disease), but these relationships also help older people to recover when they do encounter poor health.</p>
<p>“In New Zealand’s increasingly diverse and ageing population little is known about what works well to alleviate social isolation and loneliness,” says Professor Gott. “One approach to addressing these issues was the provision of volunteer and befriending services, but there is a lack of evidence regarding their effectiveness and cost effectiveness.”</p>
