<p>For Immediate Release</p>
<p><strong>A day down on the farm: Owl Farm’s first Annual Public Open Day</strong></p>
<p>Owl Farm in Cambridge is opening its gates to urban communities for its inaugural Open Day on Saturday 15 October, 11am until 4pm.</p>
<p>The theme, ‘From our grass to your glass, how your milk is made’, aims to close the gap between town and country by giving the communities in which Owl Farm operates an up-close experience of a working dairy farm.</p>
<p>“It’s vitally important that the dairy industry engage and demonstrate what dairy is all about, and where our milk comes from,” says Demonstration Manager Doug Dibley. “The event will be a fantastic opportunity for a fun and educational day on the farm for the whole family”.</p>
<p>New Zealand has a rich heritage in dairy farming. We’ve been exporting our high quality products to the world for well over a century. Our products are considered some of the best globally, by-in-large for the trust that consumers have in the safety and quality of our milk and our processors. This day provides the platform for us to educate our urban neighbours on how and why.</p>
<p>There will be plenty to do and see for the whole family. Owl Farm’s partners are some of biggest names in the dairy industry and will be onsite with interactive displays supporting the theme.</p>
<p>Other activities include:</p>
<p>• Free ice-creams and sausage sizzles.</p>
<p>• An opportunity to plant native trees in a recently constructed treatment wetland. The wetland is funded by both Waikato River Authority and Waikato Regional Council and ably supported by Opus and Lincoln Agri-Tech. It will have significant environmental benefits for water quality for years to come. Owl Farm want as many people as possible to share in this positive experience.</p>
