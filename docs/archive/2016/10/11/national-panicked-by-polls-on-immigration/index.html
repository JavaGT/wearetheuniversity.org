<p>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>11 OCTOBER 2016  </p>
<p>National Panicked by Polls on Immigration</p>
<p>The National government have been panicked by the polls on immigration and cannot be trusted on the issue, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament, Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Prime Minister John Key denied in the House that parent migrants are a concern while Tertiary Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce said they had the right mix for skilled migrants coming here.</p>
<p>“So why the sudden change?</p>
<p>“The plain fact is after years of denial, their polling is telling them the public are concerned.</p>
<p>“They will merely tinker with the issue</p>
<p>“National have created a massive problem by bringing in huge numbers of unskilled migrants, and the Parent Category has meant their parents have flooded in also.</p>
<p>“Over 15 years we have taken in over 87,000 parent migrants who have no requirements to contribute to the economy while they receive free access to public health immediately, and superannuation after just 10 years here.</p>
<p>“National have created an appalling mess of massive demand against short supply in infrastructure, housing, health and education,” Mr Peters says.</p>
