<p><strong>COUNTDOWN ADVERT HIGHLIGHTS INDIAN STUDENT RIP OFF COMMONPLACE</strong></p>
<p>An advertisement seeking &quot;Asian student labor&quot;, &quot;cash $6.50 behind screen&quot; was boldly placed on a Countdown noticeboard in Auckland despite being a blatant abuse of our laws, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>&quot;It confirms the rip off of students, often by people from their own countries, is so commonplace employers are advertising publicly.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been so many cases of exploitation yet the government has been slow and weak to act. The Prime Minister has a lot of explaining to do in India over the abuse of Indian students in this country.</p>
<p>&quot;The Countdown advertisement confirms the advertiser, a motelier, is not fearful of authorities. The owner ‘Indian’, the manager ‘Chinese’ accepts that low wages and cash payments are everyday practice.</p>
<p>&quot;Even Countdown saw nothing wrong with allowing the notice to be pinned up.</p>
<p>&quot;This is exploitation in broad daylight not in back alleys and behind closed doors.</p>
<p>&quot;There can be only one reason – it is widespread, there is little policing of advertising and work conditions, and unfortunately New Zealand has sunk to Third World practices.</p>
<p>&quot;National has allowed exploitation to explode by an excessive intake of foreign students and lack of proper scrutiny of student visa applications.&quot;</p>
