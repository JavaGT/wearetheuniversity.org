<p>Students explore 30 years of Homosexual Law Reform</p>
<p>A new exhibition uses archival material from the University of Canterbury’s Macmillan Brown Library collection to mark 30 years since the Homosexual Law Reform (HLR) Bill was passed in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The exhibition, <em>Inviting In: Exploring 30 years of Homosexual Law Reform</em>, uses the UC Macmillan Brown Library archives to explore the lead-up to the HLR Bill being passed and the impact it had on the LGBTQ+ community in Christchurch.</p>
<p>The exhibition includes items that have never been displayed publicly before, such as fliers, posters and correspondence from the Robin Duff Gay Liberation Movement papers, National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce records and the papers of Betty Roberts, as well as magazines such as <em>Pink Triangle</em> and <em>Canta</em>.</p>
<p>The exhibition has been curated for Beca Heritage Week by two UC College of Arts interns, Luke Shepard and Hannah Milne, with the help from the University’s Macmillan Brown Library Archivist Erin Kimber. Under the academic supervision of UC History Professor Katie Pickles and English lecturer Karen Saunders, the interns chose the items to feature in the exhibition, researched and wrote interpretation labels, and designed the layout.</p>
<p>This is the first time the students have worked on an exhibition, and the project has provided an opportunity to not only develop their research skills, but also key workplace skills. Bachelor of Arts student Hannah Milne says the internship has given her more idea of what competencies are needed in the current workplace. She says she has enjoyed engaging with the collections, and will use the skills she has developed as she continues her academic career at UC.</p>

<p>“Touching the archives has intrigued me and the time spent researching flies by. Going in to my internship is always my favourite part of the day. It thrills me that I get to create something that is so interesting,” Hannah says.</p>
<p>As the president of the UCSA Society for LGBTQ+ on campus, Q Canterbury (QC), intern Luke Shepard has identified with the material he is examining.</p>
<p>“Thirty years ago, the society for the LGBTQ+ community at UC was called GUSS (Gay University Students’ Society). I’ve thought about some of the parallels between the work QC does and the work that GUSS did 30 years ago, fighting for the HLR Bill to be passed. I look at that and the commitment involved, and I’m filled with respect. Then I compare that to what Q Canterbury does, working against ignorance and educating people. I’m forever grateful for how this internship has opened my eyes in so many different ways.”</p>
<p>According to archivist Erin Kimber, UC’s Library holds one of the most significant archive collections in the South Island.</p>
<p>“And it’s fantastic that the UC Arts Internship programme gives students the opportunity to delve into this material and use it to tell a story about Christchurch’s past.”</p>
<p>The exhibition will be accompanied by a series of talks by UC academics during the week 17 – 21 October, including Dean of Law Professor Ursula Cheer, Senior Lecturer Nicola Surtees, English lecturer Karen Saunders, Associate Professor Kathleen Quinlivan and Lecturer in Contemporary Art Dr Barbara Garrie.</p>
<p><em>Inviting In: Exploring 30 years of Homosexual Law Reform</em> 14 October – 11 November 2016, Matariki Gallery, Matariki building, University of Canterbury, Ilam, Christchurch. The exhibition opening event will be in Matariki Gallery on Monday 17 October at 5pm.</p>
