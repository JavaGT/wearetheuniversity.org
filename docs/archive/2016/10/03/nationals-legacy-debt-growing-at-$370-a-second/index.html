<p><strong>Monday, 3 October 2016, 4:14 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>NATIONAL’S LEGACY – DEBT GROWING AT $370 A SECOND</strong></p>
<p>The truth behind the mirage-like ‘rock star economy’ is that it is a massive debt bubble that has mushroomed under the National government.</p>
<p>“Since National came to office, household debt has shot up by $65.3 billion, farm debt by $16.7 billion and business debt by another $9.9 billion,” says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“The only rocks in this economy are the ones in the heads of the so-called cheerleaders who won’t face up to the underlying truth about this economy if they fell over it.</p>
<p>“National has been in office for 2,875 days and during that time private debt, as opposed to government debt, has grown $92 billion or $370 every single second.</p>
<p>“National promised to cut debt but their policies have encouraged it as the housing bubble shows.</p>
<p>“And despite National’s record-breaking immigration, with the population swelling by 440,000 people, average per-person debt has been record breaking alongside declining per-capita GDP. That means that whilst the economy might be growing the share of that growth per person is declining. A measurement the experts are at pains not to reveal. If they were to reveal this simple fact, declining capital GDP, then it would reveal how shallow their thinking is.</p>
<p>“National is playing a dangerous game of deceit and while private debt grows so too has total government debt. Core crown debt ignores the $54 billion owed by students, councils and by state-owned enterprises.</p>

<p>“National claims to be responsible economic managers but its debt-fuelled policies prove it is not. People may have trusted them for a while but as middle-income New Zealanders struggle those days are coming to an end,” says Mr Peters.</p>
