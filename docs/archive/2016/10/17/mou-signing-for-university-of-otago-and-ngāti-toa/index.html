<p><strong>MoU signing for University of Otago and Ngāti Toa</strong></p>
<p>The University of Otago will renew an important Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Te Runanga o Toa Rangatira on Monday this week.</p>
<p>The MoU will be signed at a ceremony at the University of Otago, Wellington, by Te Taku Parai, chair of Te Rūnanga, Sir Matiu Rei, Te Rūnanga Executive Director, and University of Otago Chancellor John Ward.</p>
<p>“The University is delighted to be re-signing and reaffirming this very important relationship which brings our two organisations closer together,” says Mr Ward.</p>
<p>Ngāti Toa Rangatira has always been in the forefront of innovations in whānau ora, primary care and health promotion – developing health and social services that are Māori-led and benefit the whole community. They are well known for their determination and strong track record in improving access to low cost primary health care for residents of Porirua and Wellington.</p>
<p>Many medical, dental, dietetics students from the University of Otago, Wellington have training placements with the health services of Te Runanga – Ora Toa Health Services.</p>
<p>University of Otago research groups also work closely with Ngāti Toa for research in their communities. Current research collaborations include studies on what helps Māori communities to quit smoking, housing and rheumatic fever, as just some examples.</p>
