<p>The University of Auckland will play a key role in a major trans-Tasman initiative tackling social inequity to be launched by Australian Prime Minister Rt. Hon. Malcolm Turnbull in Canberra today.</p>
<p>Professor Cindy Kiro from the University of Auckland’s Faculty of Education and Social Work will speak at the launch of the new Atlantic Fellowships for Social Equity programme.</p>
<p>Led by the University of Melbourne, the fellowships will equip an entire generation of leaders with the skills to improve equity in indigenous and non-indigenous communities in Australia, New Zealand and after three years, in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Starting next year, up to 25 fellowships will be awarded each year for the next 20 years to produce up to 500 social change leaders.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be a partner in the Atlantic Fellows for Social Equity programme,” says Professor Stuart McCutcheon, University of Auckland Vice-Chancellor.</p>
<p>“As the largest provider of degree education to Māori (indigenous) and Pacific people in New Zealand, and a major centre for Māori and Pacific research, the University of Auckland has a strong commitment to leadership development in those communities.”</p>
<p>“We welcome the opportunity to partner with the University of Melbourne in bringing our expertise to bear on the challenge of creating greater social equity across Australasia and the Pacific.”</p>
<p>Fellows will be selected from a diverse range of backgrounds and sectors and must demonstrate a commitment to the social equity ideals of the Atlantic Philanthropic Trust who are supporting the programme.</p>
<p>The programme will be open to mid-level career leaders from Australia and New Zealand, with a focus on indigenous leaders and will eventually be expanded to include the Pacific Islands and wider Pacific Rim.</p>
<p>Two of the University of Auckland’s most distinguished Māori leaders, Professor Kiro and Pro Vice-Chancellor (Māori) Jim Peters, will oversee the fellowships in New Zealand.  Professor Kiro has taken up a role as the University of Auckland Director for the programme from October.</p>
<p>Successful Fellows from both countries will have the opportunity to complete placements organised by the University of Auckland to work within indigenous and disadvantaged communities in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Professor Kiro says the 20-year programme has major benefits for both New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>“Not only will our Fellows be part of a global network of Atlantic Fellows, but they will have contributed to other communities through their projects, learned new skills that facilitate their effectiveness, and have doors opened that would otherwise have remained closed,” Professor Kiro says.</p>
<p>“It is a significant opportunity to grow leadership within disadvantaged communities and to enrich our societies. It is time for Australia and New Zealand to grapple with the issues facing our indigenous people and deepen the dialogue with those who experience inequity.”</p>
<p>The Fellowships are part of the Atlantic Fellows for Social Equity programme, a global initiative which aims to advance a fairer, healthier, more resilient and inclusive society.</p>
<p>In addition to the Universities of Melbourne and Auckland, an international network of partners will support and deliver the programme, including:</p>
<p>Queensland University of Technology<br>Brotherhood of St Laurence (an Australian community organisation)<br>The Commonwealth Government of Australia<br>Jawun (an Australian Indigenous community organisation)<br>The Atlantic Institute, based at the Rhodes Trust<br>Peak Aboriginal organisations<br>Iwi/Hapu and Māori community organisations  </p>
