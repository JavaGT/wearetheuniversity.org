<p>PPTA president&#39;s comments disgrace her profession</p>
<p>ACT Leader David Seymour says teachers should call for Post Primary Teachers’ Association (PPTA) President Angela Roberts&#39; resignation after her casual dismissal of inappropriate conduct towards students being due to ‘stress.’</p>
<p>“When it suits them, the PPTA claim to be the altruistic guardians of children’s education,“ says Mr Seymour. “When it is revealed that 10 teachers are being investigated, six for inappropriate conduct, in the past month, the PPTA President had the following to say: ‘They may find that there is an increased trend of teachers who are suffering from significant stress, and some really poor decisions get made.’</p>
<p>“Inappropriate conduct can severely damage a child for life. Over the past three years 75 teachers have been investigated and 54 struck off, but the PPTA show no remorse, simply citing ’stress’ and ’bad decisions.’ It’s a joke. The thousands of good teachers up and down New Zealand should be outraged and making it clear that these comments are not in their name.</p>
<p>“What she could have said is that the PPTA strongly opposes child abuse by teachers, there is no excuse, and the PPTA will be taking steps to protect children. Instead, she explains it away as being someone else’s fault, someone else’s responsibility.</p>
<p>“The PPTA frequently claim that lobbying and strikes are not out of self-interest but concern for children’s education. These comments, unintentionally perhaps but true all the same, show a union out of control and living in a parallel universe. The comments are a disgrace for the whole profession and Roberts should either apologise or resign.”</p>
