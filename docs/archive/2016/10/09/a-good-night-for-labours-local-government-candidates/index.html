<p><strong>Sunday, 9 October 2016, 11:01 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>A good night for Labour’s local government candidates</p>
<p>It has been a good night for Labour in the local government elections.</p>
<p>In Wellington, Justin Lester became the first Labour mayor for 30 years, leading a council where three out of four Labour candidates were elected. Both of Labour’s Wellington Regional Council and CCDHB candidates were also successful.</p>
<p>In Auckland, Labour MP Phil Goff comfortably won the mayoralty and will be joined by many new and existing local board colleagues standing for Labour or Labour-endorsed tickets.</p>
<p>In Palmerston North Labour’s Lorna Johnson was elected to the council for the first time and former Labour cabinet ministers Lianne Dalziel and Steve Chadwick were reelected as mayor in Christchurch and Rotorua. In Whanganui, 2014 Labour parliamentary candidate Hamish McDouall is the city’s new mayor.</p>
<p>In Christchurch, Labour endorsed ‘The People’s Choice’ did well with Anne Galloway taking a seat at the council table and Jake McLellan elected to the Central Ward Community Board. Joining Jake and Anne are several reelected The People’s Choice candidates at council, local board and Environment Canterbury level.</p>
<p>Commenting on the results, Labour Party President, Nigel Haworth said: “This has been a good night for the Labour Party. Our three largest cities now have Labour mayors and many more have been elected to local boards, councils, regional councils, and DHBs.”</p>
<p>“Across the country we&#39;ve run strong, grassroots campaigns talking directly with voters about the issues that matter in their communities. Congratulations to all new and reelected Labour candidates.”</p>
<p>“In Auckland the focus now turns to a byelection in Mt Roskill. We have an excellent local candidate in Michael Wood but will be taking nothing for granted. Labour will be working very hard in the Mt Roskill community over the coming weeks,” said Haworth.</p>
