<p>New classrooms for Kimi Ora School</p>
<p>Lower Hutt’s Kimi Ora School will get three new classrooms, says National List MP Chris Bishop.</p>
<p>The Kimi Ora project is part of a $2.1 million investment in six classrooms at schools in Wellington and Kapiti. The announcement was made yesterday by Minister of Education Hekia Parata.</p>
<p>“Giving Kimi Ora School more capacity with another three classrooms will help the school accommodate its roll growth,” says Mr Bishop, the National List MP based in Hutt South.</p>
<p>“This government is investing in education infrastructure. We’ve increased the overall education budget and targeted support to at-risk students, and we’re supporting schools to work together to raise achievement through communities of learning,” Mr Bishop said.</p>
<p>“This investment is part of a second round of investments in new classrooms under Budget 2016, which provides $882.5 million for school property, including 480 new classrooms to meet roll growth.</p>
<p>“The first round of investments announced 14 new classrooms in the greater Wellington region. These ongoing announcements demonstrate National’s continuing commitment to Hutt kids’ education.</p>
