<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>20 October 2016</p>
<p>Police struggle to hold the line in Northland</p>
<p>Labour’s promise of a thousand extra police will go a long way to calming the fears of people in the North, says the MP for Te Tai Tokerau Kelvin Davis.</p>
<p>“Police are talking about the Northland towns of Kaitaia and Kaikohe now being ‘lost causes’ after a succession of gang linked assaults and murders.</p>
<p>“Life is getting frightening for those of us who live in the North. The police are just under resourced.</p>
<p>“To try to keep the lid on Kaitaia six extra police were promised for the Northland district, but I understand that so far only two have been posted into the area.</p>
<p>“The assurances this week from gang leaders that people were safe as long as they didn’t get hit by a stray bullet are not reassuring.</p>
<p>“When the mayor of Whangarei, Sheryl Mai makes a public appeal for calm it’s clear that policing is now so undermanned the region is in trouble.</p>
<p>“Judith Collins and the Government have allowed the North to slide into ‘Wild West’ law and the only solution now is for the Labour cavalry to ride to the rescue with extra police,” says Kelvin Davis.</p>
