<p>Black Stick George Muir might be playing the midfield for New Zealand one day, the next he is preparing for a business or law exam.</p>
<p>He is one of more than 100 University of Auckland students who have competed in elite-level sports since the University’s High Performance Student Support Programme began three years ago.</p>
<p>The University of Auckland is now the latest tertiary institution to join the Athlete Friendly Tertiary Network, run by High Performance Sport New Zealand, further strengthening its commitment to support student athletes.  </p>
<p>The network commits tertiary institutions to a set of guiding principles to support high performance athletes, and provides a structured system for athletes and tertiary providers to follow.  </p>
<p>“Belonging to the Athlete Friendly Tertiary Network speaks of our willingness to work with our students to achieve at the highest level academically and succeed on the world sporting stage,” says Director of Sport and Recreation, Louis Rattray.  </p>
<p>“The University is proud to become a member of the network, particularly in an Olympic year when seven current University of Auckland students competed at the 2016 Rio Olympics, including bronze medallist Eliza McCartney.”  </p>
<p>For 22 year-old Muir, having the flexibility to study and sit exams while on tournament meant he didn’t have to sacrifice university to play hockey.<br>The University’s High Performance Student Support Programme works on Muir’s behalf, negotiating his sporting commitments with lecturers and faculties. Muir has sat exams in Argentina and Holland.  </p>
<p>“While I love the sport, hockey players don’t earn big salaries, so it’s important to plan for a life after hockey and to provide balance in our lives. It gives me something else to take my mind off sport,” says Muir, who trains for about 25 hours a week.  </p>
<p>He is completing a conjoint Bachelor of Commerce and Laws degree and will take about seven years to complete the five-year degree.<br>“Integrating sporting performance and academic aspirations is a reality for hundreds of University of Auckland students,” Louis says.  </p>
<p>“Our programme offers support, access to the campus gym and funding opportunities for those performing at the top of their discipline.”<br>The High Performance Student Support Programme also includes students performing in arts and cultural activities.<br> <br>  <br><strong>Media contact:</strong><br>Danelle Clayton<br>Email: <a href="mailto:d.clayton@auckland.ac.nz">d.clayton@auckland.ac.nz</a><br>Mobile: 027 537 2580</p>
