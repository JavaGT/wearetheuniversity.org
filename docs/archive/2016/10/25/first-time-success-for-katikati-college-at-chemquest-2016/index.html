<p><strong>Tuesday, 25 October 2016, 10:45 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato">University of Waikato</a></strong></p>
<p>25 October 2016</p>
<p><strong>First time Success for Katikati College at Chemquest 2016</strong></p>
<p>Prizes were shared across the Greater Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions at the University of Waikato’s ChemQuest challenge held last Wednesday night.</p>
<p>It was a close contest with only two marks separating first and fifth places. First place went to Fergus Chinnery, Lucy Douglas and Steven Zhang from Katikati College. The students were awarded the James and Wells trophy, $150 and a gold medal each. This was the first time in Chemquest history Katikati College won first place.</p>
<p>Second and third places went to teams from Hillcrest High School and Tauranga Boys’ College respectively, followed by a team from Waikato Diocesan School for Girls in fourth place and Whakatane High School coming in fifth.</p>
<p>The annual chemistry quiz gives Year 12 chemistry students the chance to put their chemistry knowledge to the test in a pop quiz-style challenge. Questions relied on a basic knowledge of chemistry and general knowledge, and were based on demonstrations featuring exploding hydrogen balloons, light sticks and a flying astronaut, while others involved well-known songs and movies that referenced chemistry.</p>
<p>Event organiser Associate Professor Michèle Prinsep says it was good to see prizes distributed all across the region.</p>
<p>&quot;Chemquest is very well supported by both local and regional schools with some teams travelling from as far as the Bay of Plenty and Taupo to participate.”</p>
