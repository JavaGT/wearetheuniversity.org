<p>Hudson congratulates Youth MP on receiving first runner-up in NZBPT competition</p>
<p>Brett Hudson, National List MP based in Ōhāriu, has congratulated his Youth MP, Stefan McClean, on winning first runner-up in the New Zealand Business &amp; Parliament Trust’s Youth Parliament competition.</p>
<p>Stefan, who is about to complete his first year at Victoria University studying Law, International Relations and German, was selected to represent Mr Hudson in this year’s Youth Parliament.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Business &amp; Parliament Trust’s competition encouraged this year’s Youth MPs to answer the question “why should young people become engaged in civic affairs and politics?”</p>
<p>The entrants were judged on how well they answered the question - originality of ideas, use of language, structure, flow and presentation.</p>
<p>Stefan submitted a video presentation for the competition and secured the first runner-up placing, together with $2000 towards his studies.</p>
<p>“Stefan proved himself to be a formidable public-speaker when Youth Parliament sat earlier this year,” Mr Hudson said. “I’m delighted to see the NZBPT recognise Stefan’s talent and political nous.</p>
<p>“I look forward to joining Stefan at the November 10 prize-giving ceremony where the Speaker of the House will present his award.</p>
<p>“It’s fantastic to see young people getting involved with politics and for Stefan to receive this prize to go towards his studies,” Mr Hudson said.</p>
