<p><strong>Deadline looming for power plant decision</strong></p>
<p>Time is running out for the Government to decide whether people will get a say on Nova Energy’s proposal to build a large gas-fired power plant in south Waikato with significant impacts on the environment and climate change, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>“The Government should ‘call in’ Nova’s application to build a new gas-fired power plant as a matter of national significance so everyone gets to have a say, because it will affect New Zealand’s commitments under the Paris Climate Change Agreement,” said Green Party energy and resources spokesperson Gareth Hughes.</p>
<p>“New Zealand has committed to reducing our climate pollution under the Paris Climate Agreement, so it would be ridiculous to allow big new sources of climate pollution to be built.</p>
<p>“It would be a massive failure of policy and leadership to allow a new power plant that could emit an estimated 425,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas pollution a year and dismiss its impacts on the climate.</p>
<p>“Almost 3000 people have signed a petition asking Nick Smith to show leadership about this power station.</p>
<p>“The <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1991/0069/latest/DLM235402.html">Resource Management Act</a> says that whether a project is relevant to New Zealand’s international obligations to the global environment – like the Paris Climate Agreement – is a factor in deciding if it’s a matter of national significance that can be ‘called in’.</p>
<p>“This dirty power plant could need another 17,000 trees planted to suck up all the CO2 pollution it could spew out.</p>

<p>“It’s common for power plants to be ‘called in’ because of their national significance, and Nova’s proposed large 360 Megawatt new gas-fired power plant should be too.*</p>
<p>“Whether you’re personally for or against this power station, its size makes it so significant that it must be treated as a matter of national interest,” Mr Hughes said.</p>
<p>Environment Minister Nick Smith has until Tuesday 25 October to decide whether to ‘call in’ the 360 MW power plant proposal as an issue of national significance for either a board of inquiry or the Environment Court to make the consenting decisions, or leave the decisions to the Otorohanga District and Waikato Regional councils, under the timeframe in the RMA.</p>
<p><strong>*List of electricity projects called in under the RMA</strong><br>· Taranaki combined cycle (gas) plant – similar to Nova’s proposed Waikato plant<br>· Hauāuru mā raki wind farm<br>· Tauhara II geothermal plant<br>· Turitea wind farm<br>· Transpower North Island grid upgrade<br>· Te Waka wind farm<br>· Te Mihi geothermal plant</p>
