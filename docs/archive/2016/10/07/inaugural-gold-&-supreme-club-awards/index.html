<p>‘It was an honour to be a part of the university’s first Gold &amp; Supreme Club Awards,’ says Victoria’s Provost, Professor Wendy Larner.</p>
<p>‘There is enormous talent at Victoria across a range of artistic and cultural fields; and it was wonderful to acknowledge some of the students who are excelling in these areas.</p>
<p>‘In doing so, we recognise their talents, hard work and dedication to their chosen artistic or cultural activity, all the while maintaining their studies.’</p>
<p>VUWSA’s President, Jonathan Gee, commended the recipients of the Gold &amp; Supreme Club Award winners for their hard work and dedication.</p>
<p>‘I’m very proud to work in partnership with Victoria recognising our diversity and cultural achievements, says Gee.</p>
<p>‘The accomplishments of the award recipients demonstrate the immense personal growth they have experienced on their journey to success. It shows they know university is not just about good grades, but getting out there and pursuing your passion.</p>
<p>‘Having a ceremony that celebrates cultural achievements is something that VUWSA has been working on for years, but it was really Tori Sellwood that pushed the importance of the awards with the University.</p>
<p>‘I feel strongly that culture and clubs should be celebrated. The students involved contribute a lot to the university community and deserve recognition for their achievements,’ says Tori Sellwood, VUWSA’s Clubs &amp; Activities Officer.</p>
<p>In addition to celebrating the cultural achievements, the Gold &amp; Supreme Club Awards provides recognition to the many volunteers who give their time to clubs across the university.</p>
<p>‘The University has over 150 clubs. Clubs really are the backbone of an exceptional student experience, and without them and the people who manage them and volunteer their time, we wouldn’t have the rich opportunities that make up our diverse community,’ says Sellwood.</p>
<p>‘The amount of time and effort involved and volunteered across the university definitely merits formal recognition by the University.’</p>
<p>The Gold Awards were awarded for cultural and artistic achievements; and five Supreme Club Awards were presented: Supreme Club of the Year, Small Supreme Club of the Year, New Club of the Year, Faculty Students’ Association of the Year, and Club President of the Year.</p>
