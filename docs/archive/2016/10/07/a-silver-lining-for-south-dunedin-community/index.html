<p>MP for Dunedin South</p>
<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>7 October 2016</p>
<p>Re-opened Police Station a silver lining for South Dunedin Community</p>
<p>The re-opening of the South Dunedin Community Police station today, more than 15 months after it was severely affected by the June 2015 floods, signals a positive step forward for the South Dunedin community, Dunedin South MP Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>“The building was extensively damaged in the flooding, and the community expressed their dismay at the unspecified time frame for the station re-opening earlier this year. In the wider South Dunedin area, there are more than 10,000 people living and working, so community policing is vital. Some feared the station could remain permanently closed.</p>
<p>“The building houses not only community policing, but also groups like the Family Harm team, South Dunedin Neighbourhood Policing Team and the local Community Constable. It would be good to see the station become more of a community hub for support services linked to policing.</p>
<p>“Today members of the community toured the new facility whilst it was given a blessing, and students from local Kings High School and Queens High School performed to mark the opening. Strong police support for the station included Deputy Police Commissioner Viv Rickard, who officially re-opened the station, indicating the importance of the community it serves.</p>
<p>“The re-opening of the station is the silver lining for a community which has suffered a lot and has resulted in a brighter and better police station for the community,” Clare Curran said.</p>
