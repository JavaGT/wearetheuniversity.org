<p>Canterbury-raised academic returns to head Lincoln University</p>
<p>Lincoln University – New Zealand’s specialist land-based university – today announced the appointment of its new Vice-Chancellor, Professor Robin Pollard.</p>
<p>Chancellor of Lincoln University, Tom Lambie, says “Following an international search that commenced in July last year, we are very pleased to have secured Robin as the new Vice-Chancellor of Lincoln University.</p>
<p>“Robin is currently Deputy Vice-Chancellor at the University of Central Lancashire in England, and has extensive experience in a number of universities around the world. Of particular interest to the Lincoln University Council is his success as a leader of university development, with experience in building overseas campuses, forging and managing partnerships, managing periods of change as well as periods of consolidation, and the development of online education. This is a tremendously significant time for Lincoln University, with the post-earthquake campus rebuild now gathering momentum and the implementation of the Lincoln Hub running in parallel – while we also look to continue to grow student numbers through our new qualifications portfolio. Robin’s experience tells us that he will have much to bring to all these important foundations of Lincoln’s future success”.</p>
<p>Robin was raised in Christchurch, with education at Cashmere primary and high schools and proceeding to a doctorate at the University of Canterbury. Robin commenced professional work on condensed-matter, holding research positions at the University of Manitoba, Canada and at the University of California, San Diego as a physicist and chemist respectively.</p>

<p>Following a move to Australia, he became interested in trans-national education, and contributed to the internationalisation of Monash University in Melbourne. His academic interests expanded to iron-bearing minerals especially those found in soils and streams, before also branching to marketing and information technology.</p>
<p>Upon the opening of the first foreign branch campus in Malaysia, Robin served as the foundation Head, School of Business and Information Technology at Monash University Sunway campus, Selangor.</p>
<p>In 2004-2007 Robin was a Pro- and Deputy Vice-Chancellor at the University of New England, with responsibilities for internationalisation, development and human resources.</p>
<p>He subsequently returned to the Monash Malaysia campus in 2007-2012 as Chief Executive and President, and contributed to the campus becoming the pre-eminent Malaysian private university.</p>
<p>In 2013 Robin led a regional Victorian campus to exit the Monash family and join Federation University Australia. As Academic Vice-President (Campus Transition and Partnerships) in 2013-2014, he facilitated the transition of a campus in Johannesburg to a new partnership with Laureate Education, and provided academic leadership for a partnership with Pearson to develop and deliver postgraduate courses online.</p>
<p>“I am delighted to be returning to Christchurch – and joining Lincoln University at a pivotal time on the institution’s journey. Key areas of focus for the University are continued growth in student numbers by ensuring excellent student experiences and outcomes, supporting high quality research and teaching, and advancing the Lincoln Hub including providing new opportunities through collaborations. Challenges and opportunities lie ahead, which we will approach with integrity and collegiality.”</p>
<p>Professor Robin Pollard will take up the position in mid-March.</p>
