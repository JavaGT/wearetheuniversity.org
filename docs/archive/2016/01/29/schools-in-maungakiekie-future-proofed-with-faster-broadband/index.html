<p><strong>Schools in Maungakiekie Future-Proofed with Faster Broadband</strong></p>
<p><strong>Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP for Maungakiekie</strong></p>
<p>Just in time for Term One, Maungakiekie’s schools are all able to connect to faster; more reliable broadband says local MP, Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.</p>
<p>“In 2010, the Government set a target of getting all state and integrated schools access to better broadband speeds by 2016. We’ve done this, on time and on budget,” Mr Lotu-Iiga said.</p>
<p>“Students, teachers, and parents in Maungakiekie will all benefit from this. It makes for reduced course material costs, better access to remote learning, and more collaboration between parents and teachers.</p>
<p>16 schools can now connect.”</p>
<p>Under the Government’s Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) and Rural Broadband Initiative (RBI) programmes, more than 2500 schools have had fibre laid to the gates, reaching around 782,000 students.</p>
<p>Now, 99.7 per cent of Kiwi students at state and integrated schools are now able to connect to UFB directly, with the remainder still able to access fast broadband via point-to-point wireless or satellite technology.</p>
<p>“I’m pleased our 16 schools will be among the most connected in the world, and will compete with students across New Zealand and the globe,” Mr Lotu-Iiga said.</p>
