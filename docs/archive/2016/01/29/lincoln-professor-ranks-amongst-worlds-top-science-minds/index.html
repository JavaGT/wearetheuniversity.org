<p>Lincoln professor ranks amongst world&#39;s top science minds</p>
<p>A Lincoln University Professor has been listed as one of the world’s Most Influential Scientific Minds for the second year running.</p>
<p>Professor of Plant Biosecurity Philip Hulme also made it on to the prestigious list in 2014. Professor Hulme was recognised by his peers for his contributions to the field of environment and ecology, earning him the mark of exceptional impact.</p>
<p>The list, which is based on publications released over an 11-year period from 2003-2013 and compiled by Thomson Reuters, recognises researchers who have published the greatest number of highly cited papers in a particular field. They rank among the top one percent most cited for their subject field and year of publication.</p>
<p>His most highly cited papers include research on the role of trade and transport on the global spread of invasive species, the environmental impacts these species cause around the world, and the implications of climate change for biosecurity.</p>
<p>Professor Hulme is one of only nine researchers across all disciplines in New Zealand to make the list, and the only one at Lincoln University. “It is great to get international recognition for the impact of your research but my success is in a large part down to having excellent collaborators nationally and internationally,” says Professor Hulme.</p>
<p>Professor Hulme is a research leader in the Bio-Protection Research Centre, a government-funded Centre of Research Excellence, and the Biological Heritage National Science Challenge.</p>
<p>“A distinctive aspect of Phil’s research is that he always examines the policy and applied implications of his findings, which undoubtedly increases the relevance and impact of his work,” says Bio-Protection Research Centre Director, Professor Travis Glare.</p>
