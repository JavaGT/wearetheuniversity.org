<p>UC students cycle the length of New Zealand for children’s charity</p>
<p>Taking the longest bike ride of their lives, a dozen University of Canterbury students will ride the length of the country to raise awareness and funds for kiwi kids living in poverty.</p>
<p>The students will set off from Bluff this Sunday, 31 January, on a 2500km trip north, traversing both islands. The team plan to cycle 130km each day, aiming to finish their epic ride in Cape Reinga on 19 February. The peloton will visit towns and businesses along the way to highlight the issue of child poverty in New Zealand and seek donations for children’s charity Variety.</p>
<p>Great New Zealand Bike Ride organisers Kip Clere, Scott Kearney and Tui Williams share a passion for the cause and were inspired to set up the event after meeting through University of Canterbury clubs.</p>
<p>“We’re young people who care and we have the skills to do something that will influence people and hopefully change some mindsets,” Clere says.</p>
<p>Everything from the event’s website, their Hawaiian shirt uniforms and the donation packages have been planned and developed by the student team. Clere says that their University clubs experience has been invaluable in planning the event.</p>
<p>“Clubs give you the chance to experience running events and businesses. We couldn’t do something like this without those skills,” he says.</p>
<p>Ultimately, they would like to see the ride become an annual UC student event to raise money for children in need.</p>

<p>“Taking care of the education and wellbeing of children means we are taking care of our future,” Clere says.</p>
<p>Donations can be made to the Great New Zealand Bike Ride for Variety via Givealittle. The team has a van, donated by UC but are seeking petrol and grocery vouchers to support their journey.</p>
