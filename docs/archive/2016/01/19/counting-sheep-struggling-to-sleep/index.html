<p><strong>Counting sheep? Struggling to sleep?</strong></p>
<p>Massey University’s Sleep/Wake Research Centre in Wellington is now providing group treatment for people with insomnia – a first in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Insomnia is a common problem, with about 30 per cent of Kiwis reporting they regularly have difficulty falling asleep and 25 per cent affected by long-term insomnia. Now Massey wants to hear from people suffering from sleeplessness who are interested in participating in the group sessions.</p>
<p>Research Officer Dr Lora Wu says while many of us occasionally have trouble getting to sleep, insomnia is when you have difficulty sleeping over a long period of time and it affects your health, relationships, and work.</p>
<p>“People who suffer from this sleep disorder either have trouble falling asleep, they wake up a lot during the night, or wake up too early and can’t get back to sleep. This can have a big effect on their alertness, mood, and performance.”</p>
<p>She says people who suffer from insomnia can feel frustrated and overwhelmed and the first steps should be discussing their concerns with a doctor.</p>
<p>The Sleep/Wake Research Centre’s treatment programme - called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia - provides a group therapy option for sufferers and has been used successfully in other parts of the world including Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, China, and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Dr Wu says the treatment is non-pharmacological and has been shown to have long-lasting effects. “Participants will learn more about sleep, insomnia, and how to better manage their sleep. They will also have the opportunity to interact with a group of individuals who suffer from insomnia and to learn from each other.”</p>

<p>Massey offers courses to both undergraduates and postgraduates about sleep and circadian physiology. The Sleep/Wake Research Centre is world-renowned for its research and employs some of New Zealand’s most highly-respected practitioners and researchers.</p>
<p>Group sessions begin on February 4th (Thursday evenings) and March 2nd (Wednesday evenings) once a week for six weeks. The treatment costs $375.</p>
<p>Individuals affected by insomnia and wanting to take part in the programme can contact the Sleep/Wake Research Centre at <a href="mailto:goodsleep@massey.ac.nz">goodsleep@massey.ac.nz</a> or 04 380 0603.</p>
<p>Participants may also be invited to be a part of ongoing research at the Sleep/Wake Research Centre to better understand and improve the sleep health of New Zealanders.</p>
