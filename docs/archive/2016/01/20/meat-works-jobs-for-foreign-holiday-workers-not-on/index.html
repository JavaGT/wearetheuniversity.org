<p>Meat Works Jobs For Foreign Holiday Workers Not On</p>
<p>With unemployment as high as 6 per cent New Zealand First wants to know why a German holidaymaker ended up getting injured in a dangerous meat works job in the Bay of Plenty – a job which a New Zealander should have been doing.</p>
<p>“How is it that this man gets a job on a slaughter chain at the Rangiuru AFFCO plant after some pressure cooker training that lasted a couple of weeks?” says New Zealand First Labour and Industrial Relations Spokesperson Clayton Mitchell.</p>
<p>“With jobs scarce in regional New Zealand, the employment of 20 foreign holiday visa workers is dubious. Is this an attempt by AFFCO to undermine local workers?</p>
<p>“It beggars belief that any meat works in the country needs to employ unskilled foreign workers given this industry has suffered huge job losses over past decades.</p>
<p>“It is unfortunate that he was injured but how did he end up working there?</p>
<p>“For decades young people and students have taken jobs at meat works, but not in the highly skilled positions which are also the most dangerous areas of the plant,” says Mr Mitchell.</p>
<p>“This man was put at serious risk.”</p>
