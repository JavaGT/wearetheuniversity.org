<p><strong>Art Exhibition: ‘PUTAHI’</strong></p>
<p>The Visual Art exhibition &#39;PUTAHI&#39; opens at the Creative Waikato Gallery, Hamilton at 5pm on Wednesday 6 January.</p>
<p>The exhibition brings together artwork produced by local Maori and international Pacifica artists at the University of Waikato’s &#39;Art Hui&#39;.</p>
<p>Artists involved have come from across the Pacific, including Hawaii, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, Tahiti and Tonga. Local Maori artists and students from Wananga across Aotearoa have also participated in the hui, held on campus.</p>
<p>Donn Ratana, Te Kura Toi Tangata Faculty of Education lecturer, says connecting with talented artists from across the Pacific allows for skills, knowledge, and culture to be shared.</p>
<p>“The relationship between Pacific nations is clear; language, ideas and images are similar. The exhibition is focused on new ways of finding form in contemporary Maori Pacifica art. This can be seen through artists’ painting, printmaking, photography, jewellery, ta moko (tattoo), mixed media and uku (clay).</p>
<p>“It’s a great opportunity for Waikato locals to see a diverse range of talented, international artists all in one place, something quite different. An example is Alexander Lee, a conceptual artist, who has been studying and working in New York,” Donn says.</p>
<p>The exhibition is open Monday-Friday (11am-2pm) until 14 January.<br>Address: 131 Alexandra Street, Hamilton</p>
