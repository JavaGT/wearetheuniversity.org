<p>Canterbury Fulbright Scholar to study California earthquakes</p>
<p>A unique coding scheme which examines what people really do in an earthquake is taking a University of Canterbury (UC) scholar all the way to California.</p>
<p>UC Master’s graduate Emily Lambie has analysed hours of CCTV footage from the Canterbury earthquakes using her innovative research system which helped her win a Fulbright scholarship to study in the United States.</p>
<p>The system does not rely on post-disaster interviews, instead observing how actually people react when the ground starts moving. Lambie developed the coding scheme for her Master&#39;s degree in Hazard and Disaster Management.</p>
<p>“The next step is to go beyond a New Zealand context and use earthquake footage from other areas,” says Lambie.</p>
<p>She will be conducting further research for the next ten months at California State University in Long Beach, which she leaves for next week.</p>
<p>“I&#39;ll have input from the American Red Cross and academic leaders from other universities. Ultimately, I want to return to New Zealand with a refined process that has been validated by its application outside of a New Zealand setting.”</p>
<p>She credits the “constant mentorship and support” at UC for helping her achieve her prestigious Fulbright scholarship to study in California.</p>
<p>“UC not only grew me into a person ready to take on the challenges of the USA, but presented the opportunity and had faith that I was the right candidate for it.”</p>
<p>Lambie expects the next ten months of international research to be transformative.</p>
<p>“When I return to New Zealand I plan to continue the research but I&#39;m keeping an open mind as to how my research questions will change and develop, as well as other interests I may want to pursue when I&#39;m home.”</p>
