<p>Students take on internships in Thailand</p>
<p>Interning at not-for-profit and ecological organisations in Bangkok is how 14 University of Canterbury (UC) students will spend the next five weeks.</p>
<p>The group left for Thailand this morning, on an experience which will not only give them internships based on their personal career goals, but also exposure to a different country.</p>
<p>Dr Stephen Hardman, UC’s College of Arts International and Internship Co-ordinator, says the students will gain real world workplace experience in a very different culture to those within New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The programme is part of a UC commitment to raise the global awareness of our students, an increasingly important attribute in the internationally networked world we live in.”</p>
<p>The internships will include working for not-for-profit organisations, research for a local ecological foundation and teaching English at Mahidol University.</p>
<p>For Christchurch born and bred Law and Arts student Julie Qiu, this will be her first trip to Thailand.</p>
<p>“It will be interesting to work in a professional environment in a foreign country. I&#39;m excited to visit the temples and learn more about Thai culture. I’ve heard the street food is amazing and want to visit an elephant sanctuary.”</p>
<p>Thai students from Mahidol University will visit Christchurch this winter and take up internships here to benefit their studies.</p>
<p>Dr Hardman says the programme has been running for three years and students who took part back in 2014 are still friends with their Thai counterparts and keep in touch online.</p>
<p>Thirteen of the UC students travelling to Thailand received Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Asia, a scheme that enables New Zealand students to experience our neighbouring continent. The UC group leaving today also includes a UC international student from Singapore.</p>
