<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong>USP farewells New Zealand diplomat</strong></p>
<p>The University of the South Pacific (USP) hosted a farewell lunch to acknowledge and thank the outgoing First Secretary (Regional Development Programme) of the New Zealand High Commission, Dr Helen Leslie on 8 January 2016.</p>
<p>Acting USP Vice-Chancellor, Dr Dilawar Grewal expressed the University’s sincere appreciation for Dr Leslie’s contribution and support to USP.</p>
<p>During her term in office, Dr Leslie helped support the development of the region through the assistance provided by the Government of New Zealand. She also played a major part in strengthening the relationship between USP and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Dr Grewal said her immense contributions, both professionally and personally, have been well appreciated by USP. He further mentioned that Dr Leslie’s engagement with USP will be greatly missed, especially her involvement with the USP Council and during high level consultations between USP and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Dr Leslie also played a key role in the formulation and finalisation of a new three-year partnership agreement between USP and New Zealand for the next triennium (2016-2018).</p>
<p>He described Dr Leslie as “an incredible friend of the University, and its staff and students.”</p>
<p>In her remarks, Dr Leslie said that she enjoyed her time in Fiji, particularly in managing the relationship between New Zealand and USP.</p>
<p>She added that New Zealand shares a long standing relationship with USP, and has supported the University since its inception in 1968.</p>

<p>Dr Leslie said despite the challenges, the relationship between New Zealand and USP was managed well, given the cooperation from the Vice-Chancellor and President of USP, Professor Rajesh Chandra and his team.</p>
<p>She said that the breadth of engagement with USP has been very satisfying, especially in ensuring that students have a quality experience at USP.</p>
<p>She congratulated USP for providing quality education in the region and wished the University well as it continues with its positive ventures in the future.</p>
