<p><strong>Students Support Action for Rental WoF</strong></p>
<p>The Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) welcomes housing-rental Warrant of Fitness (WoF) study being undertaken by the University of Otago working with Wellington City Council this year (released in Stuff 5 January 2016).</p>
<p>VUWSA President, Jonathan Gee, said that a rental warrant of fitness has been a long-standing student policy in local body elections.</p>
<p>‘Victoria University students campaigned for healthier homes in the 2013 local body election, and we hope Council candidates prioritise a rental warrant of fitness in the upcoming election in October,’ says Gee.</p>
<p>It’s pleasing to hear that Wellington Mayor Celia Wade-Brown views the rental WoF as part of a range of initiatives for quality and affordable housing, and we hope that the Council makes it a top priority in the next election cycle.’</p>
<p>Securing a warm, dry flat is a particular worry at this time of year, as thousands of students begin the annual flat hunt.</p>
<p>Welfare Vice President, Rory Lenihan-Ikin, says, ‘This is a relief for students that suffer from continuous bouts of sickness and rising electricity bills. This is the first step towards ensuring our students’ well-being is not undermined.’</p>
<p>‘January and February is a busy time for students as they try to secure a quality and affordable flat for the year. Unfortunately, since there can be an inaccurate student stereotype, students often have to settle for substandard rentals,’ says Gee.</p>
<p>A rental WoF will make sure that all renters have access to equally healthy housing.</p>
<p>VUWSA looks forward to supporting this Study for warmer, drier and better flats for our most vulnerable population including students, low-income children and the elderly.</p>
