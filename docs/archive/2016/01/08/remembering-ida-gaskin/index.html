<p><strong>Remembering Ida Gaskin</strong></p>
<p>The death of Dr Ida Gaskin in New Plymouth at the age of 96 is personally a very sad occasion for me, says Opposition Leader Andrew Little.</p>
<p>“She was briefly my teacher and once inspired me to enter a speech contest at New Plymouth Boys High School which I won.</p>
<p>“She will always be remembered as the country’s leading authority on William Shakespeare and won the quiz show Mastermind on this subject.</p>
<p>“She was always passionate about Shakespeare and she was a fantastic teacher.</p>
<p>“Ida was shaped by her family background in Wales during the depression and she emigrated to New Zealand in 1946 to escape post war Britain.</p>
<p>“She received a doctorate from Waikato University in 2001 for her contribution to culture.</p>
<p>“Most of us in the Labour Party remember her as a dedicated and doughty supporter. She was also a one-time Labour candidate in 1984,” says Andrew Little.</p>
