<p>Andrew Kirton  </p>
<p>The NZLP is delighted to announce the appointment of Andrew Kirton as its new General Secretary.</p>
<p>Andrew brings to the position broad and senior experience from previous roles in the private sector and government, both here and in the UK.</p>
<p>Andrew was head of public affairs for Heathrow Airport before joining international construction company, Mace Group, to lead their global corporate affairs function.</p>
<p>Andrew has maintained his links to the Labour Party during his time abroad, including organising Labour’s support network in London and campaigning for the expat vote during the last two general elections.</p>
<p>Prior to his UK experience, Andrew worked as an advisor to former Prime Minister the Rt Hon Helen Clark and was also Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>Andrew was born and raised in Taumarunui.</p>
<p>&quot;Andrew has the attributes of energy and dynamism, coupled with a firm commitment to Labour&#39;s values, which equip him ideally for this demanding role&quot;, said Labour Party President, Professor Nigel Haworth.</p>
<p>Andrew takes up his new position in mid April.</p>
