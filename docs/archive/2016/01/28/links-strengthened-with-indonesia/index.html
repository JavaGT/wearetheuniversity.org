<p>28 January 2016</p>
<p>Links between Indonesia and New Zealand have been strengthened with a new agreement between their leading universities.</p>
<p>The University of Auckland has recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the University of Indonesia that formalises a long-standing relationship between the two universities.</p>
<p>New Zealand has shared geothermal expertise with Indonesia since New Zealand and Indonesian engineers developed Indonesia’s first geothermal energy in the 1970s.</p>
<p>More than 160 Indonesian engineers have trained at the University of Auckland’s Geothermal Institute that with UniServices has more than $1 million per year of geothermal exploration and related contracts in Indonesia.</p>
<p>The University also works closely with the Indonesian Ministries of Finance and Higher Education that offer scholarships to enable students to study in New Zealand and then return to Indonesia where they can share their knowledge and contribute back to their local communities.</p>
<p>“Education is one of New Zealand’s trade priorities with Indonesia and the University of Auckland is proud to support that priority” says the University of Auckland’s deputy Vice- Chancellor of Strategic Engagement, Professor Jennifer Dixon. “We look forward to seeing what academic contributions we can collectively make as a result of the sharing of knowledge and resources that this MOU promotes.”</p>
<p>The MOU was signed late last year by the University of Indonesia’s Rector, Professor Ir Muhammad Anis and Professor Dixon.</p>
<p>“The MOU indicates a mutual commitment of academic cooperation that will promote further educational collaboration and cultural understanding to make possible the exchange of students, scholars and educational resources,” says Professor Dixon.</p>
<p>Founded in 1849, the University of Indonesia is the oldest tertiary-level educational institution in Indonesia. The University has two campuses; one in Jakarta’s central business (Salemba) and one in Depok (West Java).</p>
<p>The University of Indonesia consists of 12 faculties divided into three clusters, including health science, science and technology, and social science and humanities. Its core research activities focus on genome and genome based proteome research for urban health, information and communication technology studies, indigenous studies, nano science and technology studies, and policy studies.
