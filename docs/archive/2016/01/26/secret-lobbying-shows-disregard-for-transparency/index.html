<p><strong>Secret Lobbying Shows Disregard for Transparency</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meka Whaitiri</strong><br>Labour MP for Ikaroa-Rāwhiti<br>Spokesperson for Local Government</p>
<p>Revelations that Environment Canterbury&#39;s (ECan) commissioners secretly lobbied the Government to retain their special powers - including blocking appeals to the Environment Court - display a worrying lack of accountability and transparency, says Labour’s Local Government Spokesperson Meka Whaitiri.</p>
<p>“This is disappointing and falls beneath the standard we should expect from local authorities,” says Meka Whaitiri.</p>
<p>“We have a group of unelected commissioners who have opted to privately lobby Government for an extension of contentious special powers, rather than make a public submission to select committee where their views can be debated with an appropriate level of scrutiny.</p>
<p>“An unelected body that has been operating with controversial special powers for 6 years should have the insight to conduct themselves with an even higher level of transparency than normal. All the commissioners have done is to reinforce the widely-held perception that ECan lacks accountability and operates with only the thinnest veil of democracy.</p>
<p>“This kind of disregard for parliamentary process is the legacy of a Government that prefers to work via backroom deals than in the light of day.</p>
<p>“I want to see smart, effective local government that stands up to robust scrutiny; transparent local government that empowers the communities they represent.</p>
<p>“A Labour Government will nurture a more cooperative model of local government and restore full democracy to the Canterbury Region,” says Meka Whaitiri.</p>
