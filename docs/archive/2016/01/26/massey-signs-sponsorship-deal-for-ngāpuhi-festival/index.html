<p><strong>Massey signs sponsorship deal for Ngāpuhi Festival</strong></p>
<p>Massey University has signaled its commitment to the North, signing up as a major sponsor of the Ngāpuhi Festival this weekend. The new deal will see the University sponsoring the main performance stage at the biennial festival.</p>
<p>Assistant Vice Chancellor Maori and Pasifika, Dr Selwyn Katene says the sponsorship is a perfect fit with the University’s ‘Grow North’ strategy. “The University is looking to help build an innovation corridor that could reach all the way to Northland and this is just one of a number of initiatives that will help connect the North with Massey”.</p>
<p>Te Runanga o Ngāpuhi Chief Executive Allen Wihongi says the deal also fits Ngāpuhi strategy to promote and support educational achievement and higher learning for Ngāphui members.</p>
<p>Student Recruitment Adviser Māori, Grace Latimer says the sponsorship aims to build mutually rewarding and enduring relationships with the largest iwi in the country, and to increase study opportunities for Māori. “Many in the North don’t realise they can take on tertiary study through Massey’s distance learning programmes without having to move away. With committed minds, an internationally recognised qualification is achievable, and can contribute to positive outcomes for respective whanau”.</p>
<p>Massey University will have a team at the Festival who are able to discuss university opportunities with prospective students.</p>
