<p>NZ universities rank in top 112 most international universities  </p>
<p>The Times Higher Education’s list of the most international universities released today ranks seven New Zealand universities within the top 112 in the world. This ranking compares the world&#39;s universities to identify the ones that are best at attracting staff and students from around the world and that have the widest range of collaborations with overseas universities.</p>
<p>Executive Director of Universities New Zealand, Chris Whelan, says these findings reinforce the high quality of New Zealand universities.</p>
<p>“We are the only country in the world with all of its universities ranked in the top 500 (3%) of universities globally. That&#39;s an incredible achievement. It&#39;s built on the fact we can attract the best teachers and researchers who can, in turn, offer world-class teaching and carry out internationally respected research.</p>
<p>&quot;For a small country at the bottom of the world, this is a source of significant economic and social benefit. Our young people don&#39;t need to leave the country to get a world-class education and we can support our industry and social institutions with skilled graduates and a steady flow of knowledge and new ideas.</p>
<p>&quot;We also contribute directly to the economy through international education. International education is this country&#39;s sixth largest export market generating $3.1 billion annually. Universities account for a third of that - mainly due to their strong reputation and rankings internationally.&quot;</p>
<p>But Chris Whelan warns that this is at risk. &quot;New Zealand universities receive only about 70% of the funding per student as comparable universities in countries like the United Kingdom and Australia. As a consequence, our rankings have been slowly slipping over the past decade and it&#39;s getting harder and harder to compete for the international staff and students.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our universities need a real and substantial increase in long term funding if they are to remain high quality and capable of continuing to carry out world class teaching and research.&quot;</p>
<p>New Zealand universities ranked as follows in the Times Higher Education world’s most international universities for 2016:  </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Auckland University of Technology</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>University of Canterbury</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>University of Auckland</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>University of Otago</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>University of Waikato</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>Massey University</p>
<p>Phil Baty, Times Higher Education World University Rankings editor says: “An institution’s global outlook is one of the key markers of a prestigious university. The top institutions hire faculty from all over the world, attract students from a global market of top talent and collaborate with leading departments wherever they happen to be based.</p>
<p>“All institutions in this list deserve to celebrate – being named one of the most international universities in the world is a sign of great potential, competitiveness and dynamism.”</p>
<p>THE considers each institution’s proportion of international staff, proportion of international students and proportion of research papers published with at least one co-author from another country.</p>
