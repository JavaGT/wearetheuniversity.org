<p>The Māori Party commends all the 2016 New Year Honour’s recipients including tāngata whenua who have committed themselves to their work and serving their communities.</p>

<p>“Mr Hapi is a remarkable and influential man, who has had an extensive career in economic development. He most notably has been a driving force in developing systems to allocate fishing assets to iwi,” says Māori Party Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell.</p>
<p>Te Aroha Paenga receives a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for her dedication to the preservation and teaching of te reo Māori.</p>

<p>List MP based in Ikaroa-Rāwhiti Marama Fox is elated that Archbishop William Brown Tūrei has been awarded an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to the Anglican Church.</p>
<p>“He is an inspirational leader who at the age of 90 continues to serve the Anglican Church. I admire his fearless nature. He provokes topical discussions including whether New Zealand can fulfil a Treaty of Waitangi promise to live as one people. He also spoke out about the 2007 Police raid, calling on the Government and Police to apologies to Ngāi Tūhoe and Ruatoki,” she says.</p>

Among his work in the community he is a Police Search and Rescue volunteer, has helped ex-servicemen with war pensions and allowance matters and is a respected kaumatua,” says Māori Party Co-leader Marama Fox.</p>
