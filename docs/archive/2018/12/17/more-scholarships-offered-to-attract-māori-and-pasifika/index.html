<p><strong>Monday, 17 December 2018, 10:11 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>Lincoln University is continuing its drive to increase Māori and Pasifika representation in tertiary study, by introducing a suite of scholarships in 2019.</p>
<p>The $5000 scholarships are intended to assist those passionate about agriculture, science, tourism, Mātauraka Māori including Mahinga kai, and to support students pathwaying up from other tertiary providers.</p>
<p>Lincoln introduced Māori and Pasifika Accommodation Scholarships at the start of 2018, while Sir Turi Carroll Scholarships for Māori student leaders were initiated in 2013.</p>
<p>Lincoln University Director Maori and Pasifika, Dr Dione Payne, said the intent of the scholarships is to support and encourage Māori and Pasifika students to achieve their aspirations for their whenua, whānau, hapū and iwi.</p>
<p>They are part of an overall strategy to increase the number of Māori and Pasifika students at Lincoln University, which includes pastoral and cultural support to create a home-like atmosphere on campus for those away from whānau.</p>
<p>The scholarships are a key component of Lincoln University’s Whenua Strategy (for Māori) and Motu Strategy (for Pasifika), she said.</p>
<p><em>The new scholarships are :</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Aoraki Connect Scholarship</em></strong>- for Māori tertiary students pathwaying up from other educational providers<br><strong><em>Mātauraka Māori Scholarship</em></strong>- for Māori students who demonstrate excellence in subjects focused on Te Ao Māori<br><strong><em>Ahuwhenua Scholarship</em></strong>- for Māori students who enrol in an agricultural focused qualification<br><strong><em>Putaiao Scholarship</em></strong>- Māori students who demonstrate an interest and excellence in science related subjects<br><strong><em>Tāpoi Scholarship</em></strong>- for Māori students that demonstrate an interest and excellence in tourism related subjects<br><strong><em>Fanua Scholarship</em></strong> - for domestic Pasifika students from any high school that demonstrate excellence in any subject that relates to Lincoln University subject areas.</p>
