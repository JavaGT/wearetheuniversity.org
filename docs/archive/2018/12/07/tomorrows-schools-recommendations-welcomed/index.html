<p>Our nation’s children are finally being put at the heart of the education system.</p>
<p>The Tomorrow’s Schools Independent Taskforce reported back today and is proposing significant changes to the way our education system is run and it includes a focus being put back on children.</p>
<p>The recommendations from the report have been welcomed by NZEI Te Riu Roa.</p>
<p>“This is putting children’s wellbeing back at the heart of education – which is what we have been saying for a very long time. It redefines what success looks like for kids and has a big focus on equity,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa President Lynda Stuart.</p>
<p>“This is a big, bold and brave move from the taskforce and we welcome it. We are excited by the opportunities that it presents.”</p>
<p>Ms Stuart says she was particularly pleased that the role of school support staff had been recognised.</p>
<p>“The report says that their status and roles (and the skills that they bring) have been a lost opportunity for schools and this report recommends that there be a career pathway for them.</p>
<p>“We obviously need to look at the finer details of the whole report, and we have lots of questions, but it is a great start.”</p>
<p>Some of the key recommendations include:</p>
<p>That school boards be reoriented so that their core responsibilities are the strategic and annual plans, student success and wellbeing, curriculum and assessment.<br>Education hubs would be established and will assume all the legal responsibilities and liabilities held by school boards with delegation back to principals and tumuaki<br>Need for a national school network strategy including a dedicated pathway for Kaupapa Maori and to support Maori language provision<br>Enrolment schemes must be fair and equitable<br>Learning support would be provided through education hubs<br>Teaching Council will work with ITE providers to ensure better preparation of teachers regarding learning needs and inclusion<br>Viable pathways for the development, and enhanced status, of paraprofessionals (support staff)<br>Recruit a diversity of teachers and guarantee employment for new teachers<br>Equity resourcing to increase to 6% of total resourcing</p>
<p>ends</p>
