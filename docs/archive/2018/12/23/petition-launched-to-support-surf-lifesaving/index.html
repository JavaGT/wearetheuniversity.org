<p><strong>Sunday, 23 December 2018, 12:54 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Petition launched to support surf lifesaving</strong></p>
<p>A petition to ensure that surf lifesaving is recognised and funded as an emergency service has been launched today by Helensville MP Chris Penk.</p>
<p>“Surf lifesaving is a vital service provided by thousands of Kiwi volunteers.</p>
<p>“Surf lifesaving clubs currently rely on funding from a combination of sporting and community grants, fundraising efforts and private sponsorship.</p>
<p>“This means surf lifesaving is forced to compete with sporting and community organisations. As a result, it’s difficult for clubs to make long-term plans and focus on the vital services they provide to their communities.</p>
<p>“This summer, I am calling on the Government to recognise surf lifesaving as an essential emergency service and allocate funding directly, to ensure our clubs remain active and sustainable into the future.</p>
<p>“My electorate includes all the surf lifesaving clubs on Auckland’s west coast so I’m keen to see them supported in this way. My National MP colleagues feel the same and I’m confident that all Kiwis will get behind our brave and dedicated surf lifesavers.”</p>
