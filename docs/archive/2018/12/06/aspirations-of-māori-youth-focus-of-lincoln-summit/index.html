<p><strong>Thursday, 6 December 2018, 3:05 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>Young Māori have gathered at Lincoln University for a summit to talk about their future.</p>
<p>Around 150 students from 41 high schools across the country (including 15 students outside the formal school system) and three tertiary institutions, are on campus.</p>
<p>Developed for Māori students between the ages of 16 and 24, the Taiohi Summit provides a forum to discuss key issues relevant to Taiohi today and to discuss their aspirations for the future in key thematic areas.</p>
<p>Lincoln University Director, Māori and Pasifika, Dr Dione Payne, said the hui is intended to engage Taiohi across Aotearoa and publish a manifesto with their strategy for the future.</p>
<p>The six areas of focus are mahinga kai, te reo Māori, cultural identity, whānau ora, sport and recreation and Māori business.</p>
<p>“We see the significant contribution that Māori make to both our economy and the world, and as the world changes, we want to make sure the voice of our Taiohi have been heard, so they have access to the tools and skills to help them grow their future,” Dr Payne said.</p>
<p>Attendees will collaborate with key innovators, engage in workshops, write their manifesto and connect, network and socialise with other like-minded Māori throughout New Zealand.</p>
<p>“From the boardroom to the paddock, we want to make sure Taiohi add their voice to the discussion,” she said.</p>
<p>The Hui started yesterday with a pōwhiri supported by kaumātua, and will end with a Celebration Dinner on Friday night.</p>
<p>Lincoln University is hosting the summit in partnership with the Ministry of Youth Development.</p>
