<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>WITT Allied Staff vote unanimously to ratify collective agreement settlement</p>
<p>4 December 2018</p>
<p>Bargaining for the renewal of the Allied Staff Collective Agreement was extremely positive and took just over four hours to conclude.</p>
<p>TIASA members at WITT Taranaki have voted unanimously to ratify the settlement which delivers them a 2% increase to salary rates (paid and printed) and, provides the Living Wage ($20.55) as the minimum hourly rate.</p>
<p>“In a sector that is currently facing many challenges it is great to have the senior management of WITT Taranaki recognise and value their greatest resource – staff. WITT have not just talked about valuing staff, they have put their money where their values are,” said TIASA Chief Executive, Peter Joseph.</p>
<p>The collective agreement takes effect from 1st October 2018 and while WITT “may” pass-on the settlement to non-union allied staff members, the pass-on provision in the TIASA/WITT collective agreement means that a period of four months must have elapsed from the commencement of the collective agreement before it can be offered to those allied staff on individual agreements.</p>
