<p>PM, don’t rob the regions to fund a trolley service</p>
<p>A booming freight industry and increasingly heavy road use in the Bay of Plenty further prove the need for the Government to commit to building a safe and reliable roading network in the region, National’s Transport spokesperson Judith Collins says.</p>
<p>“By holding our annual two day Caucus in Tauranga this year, National MPs have been able to see first-hand what difference the opening of roads like the Tauranga Eastern Link have had on the region,” Ms Collins says.</p>
<p>“While the National Government committed to building the Tauranga to Hamilton section of the Waikato Expressway, as well as upgrading the Tauranga to Katikati link, the Labour Government is yet to front up on its plans for the region.</p>
<p>“The road upgrades in Tauranga must go ahead as planned to improve road safety and for the ongoing growth of the local economy. It is one of the most dangerous roads in New Zealand – as acknowledged recently by a local Mayor.</p>
<p>“The Tauranga Northern link had funding approved last year. The Labour-led Government needs to commit to the completion of this important road from Tauranga to Katikati.</p>
<p>“The Waikato expressway’s improvements as one of the first Roads of National Significance is doing immensely well and work must continue for its extension from Cambridge to the foot of the Kaimai Range and from Cambridge to Tirau,” Ms Collins says.</p>
<p>National recently launched petitions to four-lane the motorway from Tauranga to Katikati as well as to fund the extension of the Waikato Expressway from Cambridge to the foot of the Kaimai Range and from Cambridge to Tirau.</p>
<p>“Let’s not rob the regions for a trolley service up Dominion Road, in the Prime Minister’s electorate,” Ms Collins says.</p>
