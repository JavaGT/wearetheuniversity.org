<p>HIKUWAI SOUNDS FESTIVAL 2018<br>FEATURING P-MONEY, SWIDT, L.A.B., &amp; MORE</p>
<p>Friday 2 March 2018<br>Hikuwai Plaza, AUT City Campus, 55 Wellesley St E, Auckland</p>
<p><strong>AUT’s Student Association</strong> (AUTSA) is stoked to present <strong><em>Hikuwai Sounds</em></strong>, Auckland’s newest addition to its summer festival calendar.</p>
<p>This one-night event will feature a huge musical lineup of some of New Zealand’s best up-and-coming acts as well as festival favourites, including <strong>P-Money</strong>, <strong>SWIDT</strong>, <strong>L.A.B.</strong>, <strong>Summer Thieves</strong> &amp; <strong>Yoko-Zuna</strong>, who will be performing live with <strong>Bailey Wiley</strong>, <strong>MeloDownz</strong> &amp; <strong>Raiza Biza</strong>.</p>
<p>Situated in the heart of Auckland City at AUT’s main quad, the festival will celebrate the end of AUT’s 2018 AUT Orientation and kick off a year of studying with a roar. Vesbar will also be on the scene serving up a range of drinks at student prices.</p>
<p>Tickets are only $10 for AUT students. Other university student tickets are $15, with general public $20. Tickets are available now from EventFinda.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hikuwai Sounds</em></strong> will see an eclectic range of sounds, headlined by <strong>P-Money</strong>. New Zealand’s most renowned producer and DJ, his talents in the studio and on the decks have made him a household name, and a pioneering figure within New Zealand music. His festival DJ sets are the stuff of legend, and this will be no different.</p>

<p>Closing the evening will be one of NZ’s most exciting live acts, <strong>Yoko-Zuna</strong>. Fresh off performances at Rhythm &amp; Vines, Rhythm &amp; Alps and supporting Shapeshifter, the band will bring their unique brand of electronic/hip-hop compositions to AUT. For this special performance, guest vocalists will include the inimitable soul-style of <strong>Bailey Wiley</strong>, Avondale’s finest <strong>MeloDownz</strong>, and the baritone storyteller <strong>Raiza Biza</strong>. They are set to release their second album this year, and this will offer an exclusive glimpse at new material.</p>
<p><strong>SWIDT</strong> come to AUT fresh off a massive 2017 which saw them become one of the biggest hip-hop acts in NZ. After releasing their debut album <strong><em>Stoneyhunga</em></strong>, they have become one of the most in-demand live acts across the festival circuit, and took home two NZ Music Awards, including Best Group. Expect 312 in the air throughout the entire Hikuwai Plaza when they take to the stage.</p>
<p>Summer has already seen <strong>L.A.B.</strong> play to packed audiences across NZ, and this will be their first Auckland show since the release of their debut album in November. Featuring members of Kora and Katchafire, L.A.B. have been tearing up the live scene since the album’s release, and fresh off supporting Six60 and Salmonella Dub, they will be bringing the party vibes.</p>
<p>Opening the night will be <strong>Summer Thieves</strong>, who know a thing of two about universities. Rising from the dusty streets of ‘Scarfiedom’, Dunedin’s Summer Thieves are a melting pop of reggae, hip-hop, rock &amp; funk. This will be their first Auckland city show this summer, and will start the night off right.</p>
<p>AUTSA is AUT students’ voice on campus and runs a wide range of events and activities, publishes the student magazine, offers a range of clubs and societies, represents student interests within the university, offers legal advice, helps students find a job while studying and more.</p>
