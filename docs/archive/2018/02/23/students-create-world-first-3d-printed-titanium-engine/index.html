<p><strong>Kiwi students create world-first 3D-printed titanium engine for Eco-marathon car</strong>  </p>
<p>The world’s first 3D-printed titanium internal combustion engine, designed and built by a team of University of Canterbury students, was unveiled this morning.</p>
<p>The engine and one-person car will compete in the 2018 Shell Eco-marathon Asia in Singapore (March 8-11) – a global event that attracts over 100 teams from tertiary institutes around the Asia-Pacific region.<br>Last year, with the University’s first entry in the international competition, the UC Eco-marathon team won the Design Award for their car, which was also a world-first, created out of 100% recyclable, vacuum-formed thermoplastic.</p>
<p>This year’s entry builds on the award-winning 2017 effort – it has the same thermoplastic body but with a new engine. In classic Kiwi reduce-reuse-recycle fashion, they’re reusing the car body but running it on carbon neutral, sustainable ethanol.</p>
<p>The Eco-marathon brings together young innovators from all over the world to find the most energy efficient car and to stimulate ideas about meeting the world’s energy needs in a responsible way.</p>
<p>The goal is not to break speed records or be the first to finish; the focus is on energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. The UC Eco-marathon car is designed to travel a distance of about 135km using only 330ml of fuel (which is the fuel tank’s capacity) or about 400km per litre of fuel.<br>UC’s Eco-marathon student team leader Robbie Murray says that after missing out on the final last year, the 2018 team is ready.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to show our car to the world and put New Zealand on the map in Singapore this year,” Robbie says.</p>
<p>“Over the past year, the team has worked incredibly hard to produce not only a competitive vehicle, but one that demonstrates fresh and forward-thinking ideas. We want to define who we are as New Zealanders, and our drive to create bold and innovative solutions to the problems with which we are faced.”</p>
<p>He says that the team of UC Engineering students pushed themselves to do something entirely new with the car this year.</p>
<p>“Our main focus has been on the development of our own 3D-printed single-cylinder internal combustion engine. The development of our own engine purpose-built for efficiency offered a challenging yet rewarding goal.”</p>
<p>UC Design Engineer Bruce Robertson, of UC Mechanical Engineering, mentors the Eco-marathon students.</p>
<p>“Every year our UC Engineering students challenge themselves with ever more out-there ideas, and I’m incredibly proud that they’re so effective at turning them into reality,” Mr Robertson says.</p>
<p>Attending the launch event, UC Engineering alumnus Owen Hey, Wells General Manager from Shell New Zealand, says he is delighted with how the UC Eco-marathon team are embracing the Shell Eco-marathon challenge.</p>
<p>“Watching the students develop the car over the last 12 months, I’ve been amazed with their bold ideas and their determination to push the boundaries – this has led to them achieving two world-firsts within their first two years of competition. The first 100% recyclable thermoplastic car last year and this year the first 3D-printed titanium engine,” Mr Hey says.</p>
<p>“It has been a privilege to be able to support and advise the team. And I can tell you that you can definitely teach an old dog new tricks because I learnt plenty from the team along the way, too.”  </p>
