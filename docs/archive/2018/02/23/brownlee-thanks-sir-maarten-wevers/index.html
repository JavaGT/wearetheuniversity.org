<p><strong>Friday, 23 February 2018, 5:33 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hon Gerry Brownlee<br>MP for Ilam</strong></p>
<p>Ilam MP Gerry Brownlee has today thanked Sir Maarten Wevers for his service to the Earthquake Commission (EQC) following his resignation.</p>
<p>“Sir Maarten Wevers chaired one of the biggest insurance company responses to any natural disaster anywhere in the world,&quot; Mr Brownlee says.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand had not experienced an event that had caused such widespread destruction, and Sir Maarten was pivotal to the EQC’s remarkable response to the challenges posed.</p>
<p>&quot;Prior to the Canterbury Earthquakes the EQC had 22 employees, at its peak time after the earthquakes the commission employed 1800 staff.</p>
<p>&quot;While Sir Maarten was chair, the EQC handled about 470,000 lodged claims. The 2600 outstanding claims represent 0.6 per cent of that total number.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of the claims that are outstanding are remedial claims, others will be disputed scopes of work, but the EQC is still open to claimants concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;It is disappointing that the Minister responsible for the EQC does not have confidence in the team that has delivered such exceptional results thus far.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important to note that insurance policy costs in New Zealand have not risen to post-quake predictions thanks, in large part, to the work of Sir Maarten and the EQC.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you Sir Maarten, for your service to the EQC, and also to the people of Canterbury.”</p>
