<p>David Seymour:  </p>
<p>Will the Government&#39;s policy on charter schools allow them to retain flexibility of funding? Will they still be able to determine their own management structure? Will teachers be required to sign up to union contracts?</p>
<p>After the Maori Caucus withdrew from the Labour list and won a clean sweep of the Maori seats, do you feel your party is giving your views on charter schools the respect they deserve?</p>
<p>Why, when the record of Maori educational underachievement is so utterly abysmal, would you bend to the will of self-serving unionists, and a Minister doing their bidding? Will you put tamariki ahead of the teachers’ unions?</p>
<p>What do you say to the Maori students in the state school system who, in interviews with the Children’s Commissioner, said they were called racist names, treated unequally, and as if they were stupid? Is it any surprise that Maori have disengaged from the state system and embraced charter schools?</p>
<p>Kelvin, will you still resign if the charter schools in your electorate are closed?</p>
<p>Willie, do you still “truly believe” in the Partnership School model? And do you still give Chris Hipkins an “E” grade for trying to scrap them?</p>
<p>Peeni, have you asked Chris Hipkins why he would “stop something that is working”?</p>
<p>Do you agree with Dr Sir Toby Curtis, member of the Iwi Chairs Forum, that politicians who want to close charter schools &quot;should visit the schools and assess these things for themselves before passing judgment”? Will you take Jacinda Ardern and Chris Hipkins to a charter school to show them the students they are serving and the results they are achieving?</p>

<p>Have you pressed Chris Hipkins on his objection that Partnership Schools do not teach the New Zealand Curriculum when in fact they all teach the Curriculum or its Maori equivalent?</p>
<p>Did you query why Mr Hipkins believes charter schools receive more money than state schools, when in fact they are funded at the same rate?</p>
<p>Have you asked him why he doesn’t like teachers not registered with EDUCANZ, when those teachers are still required to have the “qualifications, skills and experiences” to raise achievement, and when this provision is used by Vanguard to recruit a former air force aircraft engineer to teach engineering?  </p>
