<p><strong>Monday, 11 June 2018, 11:25 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>While the Deputy Prime Minister’s decision to oppose scrapping the three strikes law is positive news, there is plenty more he could achieve in his time as Acting PM, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT has drafted a modest wishlist, should Peters want to do more than simply enjoy the baubles that come with his new office.</p>
<p>&quot;Acting PM Peters could allow all businesses - not just small firms - to keep 90-day trials.</p>
<p>“Businesses overwhelmingly support this ACT policy because it gives them the confidence to take on young or unskilled workers.</p>
<p>&quot;He could reverse the ban on offshore oil and gas exploration.</p>
<p>“The Government’s ban will risk security of energy supply, increase costs to consumers, increase global greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce economic activity and royalties to the Crown.</p>
<p>&quot;Winston should also halt the process that would see an end to the Partnership School model, which polling shows a majority of NZ First voters support.</p>
<p>&quot;1500 students from disadvantaged backgrounds who were failing in the state system are being given a second chance. Partnership Schools are changing their lives for the better.</p>
<p>&quot;If there’s still time left, Peters can begin reforming the RMA and get the ball rolling on completing the Auckland motorway network.</p>
<p>“RMA reform would unleash the private sector’s ability to build affordable houses, and a completed motorway network will unlock Auckland’s productivity potential.</p>
<p>&quot;Winston Peters could use his six weeks as Acting PM to enjoy the baubles of office and drift aimlessly, or blunt the radical edges of the Ardern Government, says Mr Seymour.</p>
