<p><strong>Saturday, 30 June 2018, 1:50 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour gives with one hand and takes with the other</p>
<p>Over 1.7 million families will be worse off because of Labour’s changes to National’s Families Package, which comes into force tomorrow, National Party Finance spokesperson Amy Adams says.</p>
<p>“The Families Package will deliver benefits to families in need – and that’s because 80 per cent of it was designed and legislated by National as part of Budget 2017,” Ms Adams says.</p>
<p>“However Labour’s removal of the $1060 tax cut for a worker on the average wage means over 1.7 million families will actually be worse off, including 257,000 families with children.</p>
<p>“Labour was quick to trumpet the benefits of its approach to the small number of families who gain under its approach – but that is cold comfort to the more than 1.7 million families who will be worse off.</p>
<p>“And that is before you take into account other Government policies which are pushing up the cost of living significantly.</p>
<p>“Changes such as higher fuel taxes, rent increases and higher income taxes are costing Kiwi families over $100 a week and that’s an unacceptable burden on New Zealanders who are trying to get ahead.</p>
<p>“National carefully managed the finances. We managed our spending to get back into surplus so we could afford a Families Package that included tax cuts for the average earner. And there was enough left to do it again in 2020, if we kept spending under control.</p>
<p>“But rather than prioritising Kiwi workers, Labour is blowing money left right and centre - $900 million for foreign diplomats, $2.8 billion for free tertiary education fees without adding any extra students, and a $3 billion slush fund so that New Zealand First can undertake their pet projects.</p>
<p>“This is classic tax and spend from Labour – cancelling the tax cuts for hard-working Kiwis and spending it on poorly thought through policies.</p>
<p>“On Planet Labour money seems to grow on trees. Taxpayers know differently, and should be allowed to keep more of what they earn.”</p>
