<p><strong>Wednesday, 20 June 2018, 11:47 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT Leader David Seymour has today challenged members of the Education and Workforce Committee to visit a charter school in their area before they decide to close them down.</p>
<p>Mr Seymour this morning made his submission on the Education Amendment Bill which proposes to end the charter school model.</p>
<p>&quot;No Government member of the Education and Workforce Committee has visited a charter school to see the outstanding results they are achieving.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe these MPs are capable of changing their minds after experiencing for themselves what is going on inside charter schools.</p>
<p>&quot;The interests of the students and their whanau have not been taken into consideration in the Government’s decision to close charter schools. Nor does the decision take account of the evidence, including the independent MartinJenkins evaluation.</p>
<p>&quot;1500 mostly disadvantaged Maori and Pasifika children will suffer if the Government forces them back into the state system that failed them in the first place&quot;, says Mr Seymour.</p>
