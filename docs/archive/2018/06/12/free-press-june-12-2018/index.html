<p><em>ACT’s regular bulletin</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Cowboy student politicians</strong></p>
<p>Just when we thought the decision to ban offshore oil and gas exploration couldn’t get any worse, it does.</p>
<p>The former student politicians running the Government have ignored the important principle that significant and controversial issues must be decided collectively by Cabinet.</p>
<p>Without any advice and without talking to those affected, three party leaders have decided the fate of an industry. That is no way to run a government.</p>
<p><strong>Where’s the upside?</strong></p>
<p>We already knew there was no cost-benefit analysis, no assessment of whether emissions would fall or if gas prices would rise, and no consultation with industry.</p>
<p>Now we have learned that the Government’s officials told them an offshore oil and gas exploration ban would likely: risk security of energy supply; increase costs to consumers; increase global greenhouse gas emissions; decrease economic activity in Taranaki; and, reduce royalties to the Crown.</p>
<p>As Fran O’Sullivan has put it, the decision put the PM’s desire to tackle her generation’s ‘nuclear free moment’ ahead of any credible plan to move New Zealand to a low emissions economy.</p>
<p><strong>More amateur hour</strong></p>
<p>The three strikes law provides further evidence the student politicians are flying by the seat of their pants.</p>
<p>Andrew Little made a song and dance about the fact he would scrap the law only to be forced into an embarrassing backdown when it became clear Winston Peters wouldn’t support the move.</p>

<p>Does the left hand know what the other left hand is doing?</p>
<p><strong>A wish list for Acting PM Peters</strong></p>
<p>In case Winston wants to do more than just enjoy the view from the ninth floor of the Beehive while he is Acting PM, there are a few more radical edges he could take off the Arden Government.</p>
<p>Reversing the oil and gas ban, allowing charter schools to remain open, beginning RMA reform, and allowing all businesses to keep 90-day trials would form the start of our modest wish list.</p>
<p><strong>A pricey Zero Carbon Act</strong></p>
<p>Climate Change Minister James Shaw released the Zero Carbon Act discussion document this week, showing that New Zealand households and businesses could be faced with massive costs.</p>
<p>In a ‘net zero emissions’ scenario in which people shift to low-emission energy and transport, average GDP per year between 2017 and 2050 is $37 billion – or 9.5 per cent – lower.</p>
<p>In another net zero emissions scenario modelled by NZIER, per household gross national disposable income falls by $10,000 or 4.3 per cent.</p>
<p><strong>Government must be transparent</strong></p>
<p>In contrast to their approach on oil and gas, James Shaw and other government ministers must be open about how much this legislation will cost Kiwis.</p>
<p>Transparency is necessary in order to have a robust debate, and it’s what taxpayers deserve.</p>
<p><strong>Vindication on Super</strong></p>
<p>ACT is the only party advocating for real changes to superannuation to ensure the scheme’s sustainability and fairness between generations.</p>
<p>Gabriel Makhlouf – the government’s chief economic adviser – vindicated that position when he said earlier this week that our superannuation age must rise.</p>
<p><strong>A fiscal time bomb</strong></p>
<p>The Budget documents show that the annual cost of superannuation will rise by $3.7 billion in the coming years – that is alarming.</p>
<p>Other parties are either too timid to make real changes, or in denial about the cost of superannuation.</p>
<p>New Zealanders are living and working longer. We can either increase taxes and borrowing, cut other programmes, or make sensible changes to superannuation now.</p>
<p><strong>Bolger appointment shows Nats, Labour identical</strong></p>
<p>The appointment of Jim Bolger to a Labour Government’s working group shows National and Labour have become indistinguishable.</p>
<p>The major parties have now agreed on the rules of the game. Labour has a slightly more caring face. National says it can do the job just a bit more efficiently.</p>
<p>But the similarities are striking. On tax, spending, corporate welfare, superannuation, the RMA, and spending on social services, Labour and National are almost identical.</p>
<p><strong>A real choice</strong></p>
<p>Voters do have a choice. ACT is committed to cutting wasteful spending and taxes, dealing with housing costs and superannuation, and fixing the structural problems that plague our social services.</p>
<p><strong>Does National believe anything when it comes to tax?</strong></p>
<p>Two tax flip-flops in seven days from National shows it can’t be trusted to stick up for Kiwi taxpayers.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Simon Bridges said it would be too difficult to roll back Phil Twyford’s regional fuel tax. Now he says it would be gone ‘in short order’ if a National Government was elected.</p>
<p>This follows Amy Adams asking Grant Robertson last week whether it was acceptable that the average earner would be pushed into the top tax bracket by inflation in 2022.</p>
<p>National had nine years to index tax brackets to inflation. They chose to do nothing, taking an extra $2.1 billion from the taxpayer in stealth tax hikes between 2011 and 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Tired thinking</strong></p>
<p>Phil Twyford is exhibiting a pre-housing crisis mentality by setting up a new housing ministry.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy – in the form of the 900-page Resource Management Act – got us into this mess. It won’t help us fix it.</p>
<p>Conspicuously absent from Phil Twyford’s housing agenda is any move to reform our planning rules to make it easier for the private sector to build houses.</p>
<p>Land use regulations – rules that determine what can be built and where – are choking the ability of the private sector to build new homes. In Auckland, they could be responsible for up to 56 per cent, or $530,000, of the cost of an average home.</p>
<p><strong>If the PM can’t build a fence…</strong></p>
<p>Last week, <em>Newshub</em> revealed that the Prime Minister is struggling to get resource consent for basic tasks at her new property.</p>
<p>How does Phil Twyford believe New Zealand can build the thousands of homes we need if our head of government can’t even put up a fence?  </p>
