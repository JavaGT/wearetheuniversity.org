<p><strong>Tuesday, 5 June 2018, 11:06 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>The former student politicians running the Government have simply ignored the important principle that significant decisions should be decided collectively by Cabinet, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>&quot;The Cabinet Manual states that significant and controversial issues &quot;must be submitted to Cabinet&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Without any advice and without talking to those affected, three people have decided the fate of an industry. That is no way to run a government.</p>
<p>&quot;Just when New Zealanders thought the decision to ban offshore oil and gas exploration couldn’t get worse, it does.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT has already revealed there was no cost-benefit analysis of the decision, no assessment of whether emissions would fall or if gas prices would rise, and no consultation with industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Now it has been revealed by <em>Stuff</em> that the decision didn’t even go through the normal Cabinet decision-making process.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve seen some own goals in my time in politics. This Government is an expert&quot;, says Mr Seymour.</p>
