<p>Jonathan Young - Energy and Resources</p>
<p>5 June 2018</p>
<p>The horror show of the Government’s lack of process on the decision to end offshore exploration runs on and on, National Energy and Resources spokesperson Jonathan Young says.</p>
<p>“Without a shadow of a doubt the Government’s statements about how the decision to end oil and gas exploration was made were extremely misleading.</p>
<p>“Energy and Resources Minister Megan Woods’ repeated claims to have consulted with the hydrocarbon sector – a requirement of the law she operates under – have been revealed as baseless with the revelation that not even the Cabinet discussed the decision.</p>
<p>“In a reply to my questions in late April, Woods said, ‘On 9 April 2018 Cabinet noted my intentions regarding Block Offer 2018 and associated policy considerations.’</p>
<p>“Alarmingly the Minister is now undertaking a retrospective process, attempting to back-fill her decision by saying she intends to prepare a Cabinet paper in the near future setting out the full details of this new policy.</p>
<p>“This is unacceptable. Taking an oral item to Cabinet on a decision that affects thousands of jobs not only in Taranaki but right across the country is scandalous, and legally perilous.</p>
<p>“This lack of process, which impacts a whole industry and potentially thousands of careers, is the type of decision the Crown Minerals Act is designed to protect New Zealanders from.</p>
<p>“Further, the Prime Minister’s press release announcing decision says ‘Officials will begin work on a review of the Crown Minerals Act to ensure the Act is consistent with this announcement,’ suggesting the Government was aware its move may be inconsistent with the law.</p>
<p>“The Crown Minerals Act specifies a clear process by which decisions are to be made to minimise sovereign risk for investors and for the New Zealand Government, and those processes don’t appear to have been followed.</p>
<p>“That is why there is potential legal action being prepared against the Government.</p>
<p>“This Government has delivered a decision without consultation with the sector it affects; without a cost-benefit analysis from Treasury; without an understanding of whether domestic or global emissions will be reduced and without any appreciation of what a constrained gas market will do for prices.</p>
<p>“Now we discover there’s no Cabinet paper nor any considered discussion by the Cabinet.</p>
<p>“This is the worst form of decision making any government could impose on a community and an industry.”</p>
