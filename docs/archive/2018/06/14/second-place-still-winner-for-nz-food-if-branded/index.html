<p>Media Release</p>
<p>14 June 2018</p>
<p>Lincoln University agri-food marketing expert Dr Nic Lees says we need to make more of being second when it comes to international food ratings.</p>
<p>Research from Lincoln University and the University of Florida, showed that most western consumers view New Zealand food as the next best thing to their local products.</p>
<p>However, Dr Lees said we are not taking advantage of this positive perception of the quality and safety of our food products.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately we are missing out on this premium because many overseas consumers are unaware their food originates in New Zealand.”</p>
<p>Dr Lees said his own research showed that the majority of New Zealand&#39;s exports are unbranded commodities that enter the manufacturing or food service sectors. This mean our products are frequently not identified to the consumer as being of New Zealand origin.</p>
<p>“The lack of branding and marketing means we give away the potential to take advantage of how consumers see our food products.”</p>
<p>In Japan, USA and Spain New Zealand was the second most trusted source for fresh fruit and vegetables. This is also true for other New Zealand food exports.</p>
<p>Consumers in the US rated NZ beef as a close second to local US beef. In the UK, New Zealand lamb was seen as just as good as local lamb.</p>
<p>“While the growing preference for local food is a challenge for our food exports, there is also a significant opportunity to use this positive view to capture greater value.”</p>
<p>Where New Zealand products are branded they capture a significant premium. This is evident with New Zealand wine and kiwifruit.</p>
<p>The price per litre of New Zealand wine is second only to France, and New Zealand kiwifruit exports are sold at a significant premium over Italian or Chilean products, Dr Lees said.</p>
<p>“If we can replicate this with other food exports then we can move away from the current focus on increasing the volume of agricultural products and focus instead on increasing value.”</p>
