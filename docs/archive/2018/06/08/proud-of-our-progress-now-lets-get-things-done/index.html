<p><strong>Friday, 8 June 2018, 11:14 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Proud of Our Progress, Now Let’s Get Things Done</p>
<p>Northcote Labour candidate Shanan Halbert talked about the progress Jacinda Ardern’s Government has made in improving the lives of the people of Northcote and his plan for getting even more done in the electorate.</p>
<p>“The Government budget made a great start in improving the lives of the people of our community here in Northcote. Already there have been real gains in transport, education, and health.”</p>
<p>“Transport Minister Phil Twyford, through ATAP and in partnership with Auckland Council, is taking action to ease congestion on our roads by building Seapath and Skypath, as well as improving the Northern Busway and downtown ferry terminal.”</p>
<p>“I was also extremely pleased to have the Minister confirm that 400 affordable homes will be built in the Tonar Street development under Kiwibuild, so that first home buyers will be able to settle in this wonderful community as I did seven years ago.”</p>
<p>“Education Minister Chris Hipkins has delivered $19.5 million to completely rebuild Onepoto Primary School. That’s fantastic as I’ve seen how run-down their buildings are and I know that around 600 more students are expected in the next ten years as a result of new housing developments.”</p>
<p>“Health Minister David Clark has delivered free doctors’ visits for everyone under 14 and cheaper GP visits for over half a million Kiwis, which will be a big help to our community in Northcote.”</p>
<p>“The hundreds of people I’ve met on the doorstep have said they want a strong local voice that will get things done in these areas - that’s what I’ll do as the local MP.”</p>
<p><strong>Shanan’s plan for Northcote</strong></p>
<p>• Improve the traffic on congested local roads by supporting investing in public transport options, by building Skypath and Seapath, and by bringing light rail to the Shore sooner</p>
<p>• Ensure our community gets the right mix of affordable and social housing in our community through Labour’s Kiwibuild programme</p>
<p>• Get our local schools the funding they need to cope with population growth and raise student achievement.</p>
