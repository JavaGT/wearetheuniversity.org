<p>ACT selects Stephen Berry for Northcote  </p>
<p>“ACT is proud to announce that Stephen Berry will contest the Northcote by-election,” says Party Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>Mr Berry is a self-made man. He left school at 16 to work at a supermarket chain where he is now one of its top managers and trouble-shooters.</p>
<p>He stood for ACT in 2014, and as the fifth-ranked and East Coast Bays candidate during the 2017 General Election. Prior to that, he contested the Auckland mayoral election in 2013, finishing third.</p>
<p>Berry resides in Forrest Hill with his husband.</p>
<p>“I have known both Dan and Shanan since university”, says Mr Seymour.</p>
<p>“They are two nice guys, but they are offering more of the same, tired ideas.</p>
<p>&quot;Northcote has suffered enough neglect from Labour and National. They now need a maverick to put their issues on the table.</p>
<p>“Stephen will bring positive, practical solutions to bear in fixing the traffic chaos on Onewa Road because he can do and say things the other candidates can’t.”</p>
<p>“I’m a life-long Aucklander who has lived on the North Shore for four years”, says Mr Berry.</p>
<p>“Having worked in nine different supermarkets in that time, on both sides of the Bridge, I’ve experienced the daily traffic jams.</p>
<p>“Labour is advocating for more public transport and National wants to take credit for whatever Labour decides. I’ll loudly advocate for what we know is successful.</p>
<p>Berry says that Northcote’s best chance for strong representation in Parliament is to elect the ACT candidate on 9 June.</p>

<p>“The Labour and National candidates, if elected, would become the lowest-ranked members in their respective caucuses, and therefore easily swallowed up by the party machinery.”</p>
<p>“Electing a second ACT MP in Northcote won’t just ensure Northcote’s issues are front and centre for the next 2 years, it will also provide a strong foundation for a centre-right government to return in 2020.”</p>
