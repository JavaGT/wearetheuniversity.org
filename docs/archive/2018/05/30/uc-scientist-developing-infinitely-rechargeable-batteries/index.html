<p><strong>Innovative UC scientist developing infinitely rechargeable batteries and nitrate sensors</strong></p>
<p>University of Canterbury chemistry expert, Dr Deborah Crittenden is a finalist in the sixth annual KiwiNet Research Commercialisation Awards, designed to celebrate impact from science through successful research commercialisation in New Zealand universities and Crown Research Institutes.</p>
<p>Dr Crittenden is developing exciting new technologies delivering environmental sustainability, including infinitely rechargeable batteries and real-time nitrate sensors.</p>
<p>A senior lecturer in UC’s School of Physical and Chemical Sciences, she is one of three finalists in the award category, Norman F.B. Barry Trust Breakthrough Innovator. Her work developing a laser sensor capable of measuring nitrates in the field is already award-winning.</p>
<p>Dr Crittenden brings a diverse skill set and pragmatic approach to developing novel scientific and technological solutions for important real-world problems that also have the potential to deliver excellent economic outcomes for New Zealand.</p>
<p>She is currently working on designing new energy storage liquids for use in redox flow batteries, and a novel nitrate sensor system based upon laser-induced photochemistry coupled to simple, low-cost detection methods. She is also developing a new platform technology for predicting how drug molecules bind to their targets on a very large scale.</p>

<p>In 2017, a spin-out company, Flow Holdings, was established to develop Dr Crittenden&#39;s molecular design work of a prototype redox flow battery. Discussions are ongoing around partnering with industry to further advance and commercialise Dr Crittenden&#39;s nitrate sensor design, which has already attracted pre-incubation funding. Dr Crittenden is in early discussions with a tech incubator around commercialising her computational drug design tool.</p>
<p>The Kiwi Innovation Network (KiwiNet) is a consortium of 16 universities, Crown Research Institutes, an Independent Research Organisation and a Crown Entity established to boost commercial outcomes from publicly funded research by helping to transform scientific discoveries into new products and services.</p>
