<p><strong>Hipkins fails to front on decile-scrapping bill</strong></p>
<p>Education Minister Chris Hipkins has refused to meet with Erica Stanford to discuss her Member’s Bill to replace the decile system with a needs index to more accurately target funding to disadvantaged students.</p>
<p>“Since my Member’s Bill was drawn from the ballot in March, Mr Hipkins has ignored several requests to meet with me about it,” Ms Stanford says.</p>
<p>“I was disappointed to receive a letter from Mr Hipkins at the eleventh hour, advising that Labour would not support the bill.</p>
<p>“He claimed he based this decision on a report from the Ministry of Education that he had been sitting on for three weeks.</p>
<p>“Had he taken the time to discuss my bill or the memo’s contents, I could have easily cleared up some of the misunderstandings in the Ministry’s misguided report.</p>
<p>“Mr Hipkins has been holding summits and calling for an ‘education conversation’, meanwhile stubbornly refusing to meet with a National MP to discuss a bill that would help some of our most vulnerable students.</p>
<p>“It is a real shame that Mr Hipkins is putting party politics above the needs of disadvantaged children.”</p>
