<p><strong>Wednesday, 9 May 2018, 4:18 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>&quot;It is both sad and ironic that charter schools will now be overseen by an ex-union boss”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>Chris Hipkins has announced that former NZEI president Bruce Adin will oversee an advisory group to replace the Partnership Schools Authorisation Board that resigned in protest in March.</p>
<p>“This shows just how close Labour is to the union movement.</p>
<p>“Chris Hipkins, right from the very start of his tenure as Education Minister, has put the teachers&#39; unions ahead of tamariki.</p>
<p>Hipkins also announced that, after months unrelenting bullying of the fledgling schools, all charter schools have decided to join the state system from which their students originally fled.</p>
<p>&quot;Today is a sad day for educational choice and for the disadvantaged children who were so well-served by these innovative schools.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision to strip away their educational opportunities will irreparably damage the Prime Minister who said that she would put children at the heart of everything her Government did&quot;, says Mr Seymour.</p>
