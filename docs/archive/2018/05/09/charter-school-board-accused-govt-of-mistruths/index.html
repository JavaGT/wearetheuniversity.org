<p>Before resigning in protest at the Government’s decision to close charter schools, the Board set up to oversee them wrote a scathing letter to Education Minister Chris Hipkins.</p>
<p>The Partnership Schools/Kura Hourua Authorisation Board resigned en masse on 1 March, saying it would play no part in implementing the Government’s decision.</p>
<p>&quot;The Board wrote that it was concerned about the &#39;many half-truths’ and ‘mistruths&#39; that the Government had used to attack charter schools”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>&quot;It criticised Government Ministers for lacking the courage to visit charter schools.</p>
<p>&quot;The Board said that &#39;the interests of the students and their whanau have not been taken into consideration in the Government’s decision to close charter schools’.</p>
<p>“Ms Isaac said that the Government’s regulatory impact statement was ‘misleading’ and that the its decision to close the schools did not take account of the evidence.</p>
<p>“She was also scathing of the Government’s desire to terminate the contracts saying it would send a ‘chilling message to parties considering contracting with the Government…that they cannot have confidence that contracts entered into in good faith will be honoured.</p>
<p>“This letter, signed by education professionals with decades of experience, exposes just how awful the Government’s charter schools policy is”, says Mr Seymour.</p>
