<p><strong>Sport and the New Zealanders: A History</strong></p>
<p>Greg Ryan &amp; Geoff Wilson</p>
<p>Auckland University Press</p>
<p>Hardback, 240 x 170 mm, 464 pages<br>9 August 2018, $65.00<br>Subject: Sports, sports history, New Zealand society<br><strong>Sport and the people of New Zealand are inseparable. This is a history of New Zealanders and the sports that we have made our own, from the Māori world to today’s professional athletes.</strong></p>
<p>‘Those two mighty products of the land, the Canterbury lamb and the All Blacks, have made New Zealand what she is in spite of politician’s claims to the contrary’, wrote famed cricket writer Dick Brittenden in 1954. ‘For many in New Zealand, prowess at sport replaces the social graces; in the pubs, during the furious session between 5pm and closing time an hour later, the friend of a relative of a horse trainer is a veritable patriarch. No matador in Madrid, no tenor in Turin could be sure of such flattering attention.’</p>
<p>Sports have played a central part in the social and cultural history of Aotearoa New Zealand but it’s a story that has not truly been told until now. Why did rugby become much more important than soccer in New Zealand? What role have Māori played in our sporting life? Do we really ‘punch above our weight’ in international sport? Does sport still define our national identity?</p>
<p>Viewing New Zealand sport as activity and as imagination, <em>Sport and the New Zealanders</em> is a major history of a central strand of New Zealand life.</p>
