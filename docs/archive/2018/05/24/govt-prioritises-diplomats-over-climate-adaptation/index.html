<p><strong>Govt prioritises diplomats over climate adaptation</strong></p>
<p>National’s Climate Change spokesperson Todd Muller has welcomed the release of a new report on New Zealand’s response to climate change but is concerned that the Government has not set aside any new funding in Budget 2018 to ensure that the recommendations of the report can be implemented.</p>
<p>“The Climate Change Adaptation Technical Working Group’s report outlines that adapting to the effects of climate change is necessary for New Zealand. However, making any meaningful changes in the short-term will be difficult given that this Government has decided to spend all their cash on tertiary students and diplomats rather than resourcing its climate change priorities.</p>
<p>“Climate Change Minister James Shaw knew this report would be released this year, so it is disappointing to see that funding that could have gone to respond to the recommendations will instead go to good-looking racehorses.</p>
<p>“The report was commissioned by the previous National Government and provides technical advice on how New Zealand can better adapt to the effects of climate change with a long-term view.</p>
<p>“It was part of our overall work programme of reducing emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change and secured increased funding in Budget 2017 for policy solutions.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders need to have a clear picture of the potential impacts of climate change on their communities. It is also absolutely critical that local and central government, as well as businesses, have the right information to make well-informed decisions about how to build resilience, invest and adapt to climate change.</p>
<p>“There were no surprises in the report’s findings and we thank all those involved for their work in producing a very thorough document that will assist successive governments as they look to navigate a very complex policy area.”</p>
