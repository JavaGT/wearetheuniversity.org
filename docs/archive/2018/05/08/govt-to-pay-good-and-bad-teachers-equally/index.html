<p><strong>Tuesday, 8 May 2018, 10:01 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Pay talks for primary school teachers begin today, with the Government set to increase salaries for poor teachers.</p>
<p>The NZEI wants a 16 per cent increase for its members. That would mean bad teachers would get a pay rise of at least several thousand dollars.</p>
<p>“It is wrong that the best teacher and the worst teacher are paid the same” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“In nearly every industry in New Zealand, people are paid according to their merits. Why should teaching be any different?</p>
<p>“Every parent know which teachers are great and which aren’t.</p>
<p>“Yet, a shockingly small number of teachers are disciplined for incompetence.</p>
<p>“In 2017, there were 127,000 registered teachers. Only 28, or 0.02 per cent, had their registration cancelled.</p>
<p>“Compare this to the legal profession where lawyers are struck off at almost five times the rate.</p>
<p>“Teaching is a job for life.</p>
<p>“ACT would increase funding for teacher salaries by $1 billion, paying good teachers more and attracting the best graduates to the profession.</p>
<p>“If the Government hadn’t decided to splash out on corporate welfare for the regions and making university for free for tomorrow’s elite, it would be able to afford this policy.</p>
<p>“Education is the most important gift we can give our children.</p>
<p>“New Zealand kids should be taught by highly-skilled professionals.</p>
<p>“It’s time that we start paying teachers on merit”, says Mr Seymour.</p>
