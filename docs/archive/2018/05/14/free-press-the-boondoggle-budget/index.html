<p><strong>Monday, 14 May 2018, 12:06 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Free Press: The ‘Boondoggle Budget’</strong></p>
<p>This Thursday, the Government will deliver its first Budget.</p>
<p>The level of waste and extravagance that will be packed into Grant Robertson’s offering – from free degrees for tomorrow’s elite, to billions in corporate welfare, a regional slush fund, and pensions for millionaires – means it deserves to be called the ‘Boondoggle Budget’.</p>
<p><strong>Free degrees for tomorrow’s elite</strong></p>
<p>Chris Hipkins’ $3 billion bribe will pay for the education of well-off kids who would have gone to university anyway and who will earn $1.4 million more over their working lives than non-graduates.</p>
<p>The policy hasn’t even led to an increase in university participation rates.</p>
<p><strong>Share the burden</strong></p>
<p>ACT says it’s only fair that students contribute to the cost of their education given they benefit the most from a degree.</p>
<p><strong>Provincial Growth Fund</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the $3 billion NZ First re-election fund is to buy the party support in the regions.</p>
<p>There’s no good economic reason for a government to fund a tourist attraction in the Hokianga or a nursery in the Bay of Plenty.</p>
<p>This fund will simply transfer some economic activity from the cities to the provinces, but the economic pie will shrink because of the higher taxes needed to pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>Scrap the slush fund</strong></p>
<p>These businesses should stand on their own two feet. If consumers don’t support them, they are saying they don’t want what is being offered.</p>

<p>It’s wrong to take taxpayer money anyway and dole it out in the form of corporate welfare.</p>
<p><strong>Education</strong></p>
<p>The education portfolio will get more money. Teachers may even get a pay rise.</p>
<p>But Chris Hipkins – for ideological reasons – won’t pay good teachers more.</p>
<p><strong>Incentives matter</strong></p>
<p>It’s wrong that the best and worst teachers are paid the same.</p>
<p>ACT would increase funding for teacher salaries by $1 billion, paying good teachers more and attracting the best graduates to the profession.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong></p>
<p>The Government has softened us up for the health sector to get more funding.</p>
<p><strong>More money, poorer results</strong></p>
<p>The state has delivered health services for decades. Budgets have increased year after year, while patient satisfaction is at its lowest level since 2006.</p>
<p>Leaky building issues at Middlemore Hospital show the problem with government running the health system.</p>
<p>Bureaucrats and politicians have little incentive deliver good results.</p>
<p>ACT says we need greater private sector involvement to ensure we get the best possible health services for our tax dollars.</p>
<p><strong>KiwiBuild</strong></p>
<p>The Government will also splash out $2 billion on KiwiBuild.</p>
<p>This is sign of the complete failure of successive administrations to change the rules to allow the private sector to more easily build houses.</p>
<p>David Parker has all but confirmed he won’t fundamentally reform the Resource Management Act.</p>
<p><strong>The worst law on our books</strong></p>
<p>The Resource Management Act restricts the supply of new land for development, pushing up the price of houses.</p>
<p>It could be adding up to $500,000 to the cost of the average Auckland home.</p>
<p>ACT has long pushed for changes to the RMA. Reform should be at the top of the Government’s agenda.</p>
<p><strong>Money down the back of the couch</strong></p>
<p>The Finance Minister asked his ministerial colleagues to identify low-value spending in their portfolios and they have found $700 million worth.</p>
<p><strong>Give it back</strong></p>
<p>You would think that if the Government found $700 million of your money it didn’t need it would give it back to you. Sadly, Robertson has no intention of doing so.</p>
<p>ACT would return this money to its rightful owners.</p>
<p><strong>Bracket creep</strong></p>
<p>Middle income earners will continue to be dragged into the highest tax bracket because successive Finance Ministers have refused to adjust tax thresholds for inflation.</p>
<p><strong>It’s your money</strong></p>
<p>Bracket creep costs the average earner $500 a year. It will cost taxpayers $2.8 billion between 2011 and 2018.</p>
<p>ACT would link tax brackets to the rate of inflation.</p>
