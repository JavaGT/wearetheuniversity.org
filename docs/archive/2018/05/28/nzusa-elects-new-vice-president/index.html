<p>Nikita Skipper has been elected as the new Vice President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA), after a Special General Meeting on Friday 25 May. Nikita takes over from Melissa Evans, who resigned in April.</p>
<p>‘This is the association that helped me to plant my feet, that empowered my voice and enabled me to grow into the person I am. I cannot wait to do the same for the next generation of NZUSA leaders,’ says Nikita, who has been serving as National Women’s Rights Officer since January.</p>
<p>Nikita won with 25 votes in her name, against her opponent Finn Shewell who received 4 votes. Students’ Associations who are members of NZUSA are given a proportional number of votes based on the student population of their institutions.</p>
<p>National President Jonathan Gee says ‘Nikita has been totally committed to serving students throughout her time at university. I’m stoked to have her by my side in this crucial year of rebuilding NZUSA so that it thrives in the future.’</p>
<p>Nikita studies at Massey University, where she is working towards a Bachelor of Business Studies and Bachelor of Arts conjoint. She is currently NZUSA’s National Women’s Rights Officer, and before that served two terms as President of the Massey University Students’ Association (MUSA). AS National Women’s Rights Officer, she has also been helping to manage the Thursdays in Black campaign against rape and violence.</p>
<p>Nikita’s term runs until 31 December 2018. She will also serve as Acting President from 16 July – 6 August when President Jonathan Gee is overseas.</p>
