<p>Grant Robertson’s first Budget uses &#39;transformation&#39; as a buzzword but offers only to spend more of taxpayers’ money, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“The former university politician has today shown himself to be a poor student of economic history. Higher taxes and greater government spending has never fixed our problems.</p>
<p>“Income tax was introduced at 5 per cent on the highest incomes. Now it&#39;s 33 percent.</p>
<p>“In the early 1900s, government spending was a one tenth of the economy. Today, it stands at a third.</p>
<p>“Yet, thousands of New Zealanders still struggle to make ends meet.</p>
<p>“There is no transformation in simply pumping more money into the same failed policies.</p>
<p>“More money for health and education won’t deliver better results. Those sectors require structural changes.</p>
<p>“Health budgets have increased year after year, yet patient satisfaction is at its lowest level since 2006.</p>
<p>“Governments have poured more and more money into education, but PISA test scores are declining.</p>
<p>“Robertson’s extravagant new welfare schemes - $6 billion in poorly-targeted spending on ‘Fees Free’ and the Provincial Growth Fund - will deliver meagre returns to hard-earned taxpayer money.</p>
<p>“Far from being a transformational Budget, this Government is simply spending taxpayers&#39; money where it feels it will get the best electoral results.</p>
<p>“Real transformation would involve structural reform of our regulations that stop home building, the funding of infrastructure, and the delivery of health and education.</p>
<p>“Robertson’s commitment to keeping the pension age at 65 means our $12 billion superannuation bill will continue to eat up more and more of the Budget.</p>
<p>“His failure to significantly cut $1.6 billion in corporate welfare, means we cannot reduce the corporate tax rate to 25 per cent, which would boost investment, wages and jobs.</p>
<p>“We now spend over $1.1 billion on accommodation assistance because successive governments haven’t reformed the Resource Management Act to boost land supply and get housing costs under control.</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s economic underperformance relative to Australia is a problem of our poor productivity. We should be cutting taxes across the board, creating incentives for New Zealanders to save, work and invest.</p>
<p>“Robertson will soon find that the problem with socialism is that at some point you run out of other people’s money.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders deserve so much better than the short-termism that this Government is serving up”, says Mr Seymour.</p>
