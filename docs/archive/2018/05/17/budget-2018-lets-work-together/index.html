<p>Students are applauding less debt as a result of the Government’s fees-free policy, but say that student issues do not end there. Student loan borrowing is $151 million lower in the first three months of this year compared to same period last year according to the Budget announced today.</p>
<p>‘That’s $151 million less going towards the $16 billion national student loan balance,’ says Jonathan Gee, National President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).</p>
<p>‘However, fees-free alone will not solve all the challenges that students face. Our vision aligns with the Education Minister’s -- a barrier-free education for all. Our message to the Minister is therefore -- let’s work together.’</p>
<p>‘The Government is on the right track, but they need to work with us and show us their plan to genuinely create a barrier-free education for all New Zealanders.’</p>
<p>‘Let’s not forget that during the 2017 general election, this Government promised to restore postgraduate student allowances and restore student loan borrowing for those studying long courses beyond 7 years of study. We’re also eagerly awaiting free counselling for under-25 year olds, as promised in the Labour/Greens Confidence and Supply Agreement. The least we expect is for those promises to be kept before we go to the polls again.’</p>
<p>Gee says that the sector will be watching next year’s Budget very closely.</p>
<p>‘In the face of course cuts, staff cuts and cuts to the humanities, the tertiary education sector is in need of a long-overdue funding boost. Better still, we need to change the funding model to ensure tertiary institutions are well-equipped to deliver a tertiary education that is good for students and good for New Zealand.’</p>
