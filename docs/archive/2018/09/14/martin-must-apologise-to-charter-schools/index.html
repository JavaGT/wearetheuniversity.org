<p><strong>Friday, 14 September 2018, 9:25 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Associate Education Minister Tracey Martin should publicly apologise to charter schools and students over her <a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=18151&qid=5703281">outrageous comments</a> during a debate on the Education Amendment Bill, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>&quot;Referring to charter schools during the debate, Martin said that &#39;...some of us wouldn’t put our dog in them.’</p>
<p>&quot;Martin - who is the Minister for Children - also decided to bring National MP Nicola Willis’ family into the debate by claiming Willis wouldn’t send her children to a charter school.</p>
<p>&quot;Martin clearly hasn’t bothered to read the final report on charter schools from independent consultants MartinJenkins which cut through the spin and painted a glowing picture of the model.  </p>
<p>&quot;That report said the schools are strongly focused on disadvantaged kids with complex needs and meeting learners’ needs using innovative practices and high-quality standards. The schools had significantly improved student and whanau engagement.</p>
<p>&quot;An email to Martin from Villa Education Trust - which operates two charter schools - said families and students would be ‘repulsed’ by the comments.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite repeated requests, Martin has never visited the two schools. She has chosen to make ignorant comments from afar.</p>
<p>“Unlike Tracey Martin, I have visited every charter school. The Education Review Office inspected every charter school before they opened.</p>
<p>&quot;Charter schools have attracted students who have been underserved by the state system and have produced amazing results.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, Te Kapehu Whetu, a charter school with a 100 per cent Māori roll, ranks in the top two schools in Northland for UE results.</p>
<p>&quot;Martin’s comments are even more bizarre given that recent polling shows the group of voters most in favour of charter schools are NZ First supporters.</p>
<p>&quot;She should immediately and publicly apologise to students, parents, teachers, and administrators involved with charter schools.&quot;</p>
