<p>David Seymour Seeks Candidates for Epsom</p>
<p>David Seymour, ACT Leader and MP for Epsom, is on the hunt for the next Youth MP for Epsom who will represent the electorate at Youth Parliament 2019.</p>
<p>Unlike other MPs, Mr Seymour is leaving the selection of Epsom’s Youth MP up to the students of Epsom.</p>
<p>“Out of 120 Youth MPs, Epsom’s Youth MP will be the only one actually elected by their peers,” says Mr Seymour.</p>
<p>“We’re having an election where students holding a valid Student ID from an Epsom high school will be able to turn out and vote by secret ballot for the candidate they want to represent them in Youth Parliament.”</p>
<p>“Voting will take place after all candidates debate the issue ‘My aspiration for the Epsom electorate and residents,’ and three follow-up questions selected at random.”</p>
<p>“Candidates will have to campaign at their schools and on social media to appeal to fellow students and turn out the vote.”</p>
<p>“The highest vote on the day wins.”</p>
<p>Students who put their names forward as candidates must be a current student at an Epsom high school, nominated by two other students from Epsom, aged between 16 and 18 years, and have filled out <a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=18123&qid=5677973">this nomination form</a> by 30 September 2018.</p>
<p>The election will be held 1:30pm Sunday 14 October at the Auckland Normal Intermediate Hall, Poronui St, Mt Eden.</p>
