<p>A survey of 700* primary and intermediate principals shows that a dire shortage of teachers is already disrupting children’s learning in most schools, with 30% reporting no suitable applicants for vacancies and 90% struggling to find relievers.</p>
<p>Almost 52% of principals said they did not have all the teaching staff they need this term, and the problem is much worse for low decile schools (62.5% in deciles 1-3, compared to 39% in deciles 8-10).</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa President Lynda Stuart said children’s education was suffering already and without urgent action, the crisis was destined to become a disaster.</p>
<p>“This is why we had a day of action on August 15 – this is desperate and the Government has to take the bold steps to make teaching a sustainable career choice again. We simply can’t wait. Teachers’ heavy workload and low pay for their qualifications and responsibilities has seen many leave the profession,” she said.</p>
<p>Finding relievers has also been very difficult, with many having already taken up permanent teaching positions. Just 10% of principals said it had been easy to find suitable relieving staff this winter.</p>
<p>34% of principals had needed to split up classes and spread the children around other classrooms more than five times this term when relieving teachers could not be found. Another 50% of principals had been forced to do so fewer than five times.</p>
<p>Ms Stuart said shifting children or ‘splitting classes’ was a desperate last resort, usually taken after a principal and other senior leaders had put their usual duties on hold to teach for the day.</p>

<p>“I’ve never heard of this happening so frequently before. It’s really disruptive to teaching and learning – for those who are spread around other classrooms, for the children who find themselves with extra classmates, and for the teachers who are trying to continue a quality teaching programme with a significantly larger group of students,” she said.</p>
<p>Many principals also reported having to cancel or postpone release time for teachers because relievers could not be found – adding to teachers’ stress and workload. Also of concern was that 81% of principals said sick teachers had still come to school on occasion because they knew there were no relievers available to take their class.</p>
<p>Other findings from the survey:</p>
<p>• 28% had to increase class sizes this term to try and manage staffing issues.<br>• 46% had to alter curriculum or programmes because of a shortage of teachers this term.<br>• 36% don’t yet know whether they will have all the teaching staff they need at the start of Term 4.<br><em>*NZEI Te Riu Roa conducted an email survey of 1749 principals on Monday, with 700 responding within 24 hours.</em></p>
