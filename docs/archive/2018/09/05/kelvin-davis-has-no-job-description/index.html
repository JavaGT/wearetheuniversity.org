<p><strong>Wednesday, 5 September 2018, 4:04 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Kelvin Davis has no job description</p>
<p>Crown/Māori Relations Minister Kelvin Davis has been in the job for ten months but still has no idea what his job description is, National’s Crown/Māori spokesperson Chris Finlayson says.</p>
<p>“Mr Davis has held the Crown/Māori portfolio since October last year, he has conducted a number of hui around the country yet the public is none the wiser as to what he should be doing.</p>
<p>“When asked in the House today what he does, Mr Davis said an announcement will be made soon.</p>
<p>“The Minister has originally said he would take a paper to Cabinet in July outlining what his delegations are, it’s now September and Mr Davis is simply saying it’ll be made soon.</p>
<p>“A year in Government will have passed before Mr Davis has figured out what he should be doing. It’s costing the taxpayer thousands of dollars for a Minister who isn’t doing any work.</p>
<p>“How can he be held to account if no one, not even the Minister himself, has a clue as to what he should be doing?”</p>
