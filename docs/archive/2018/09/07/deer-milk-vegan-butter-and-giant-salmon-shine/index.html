<p><strong>Deer milk, vegan butter and giant salmon among food awards finalists</strong>  </p>
<p>Finalists for the 2018 New Zealand Food Awards include a range of products new to grocery shelves, including Pāmu deer milk powder, Ōra King TYEE salmon from New Zealand King Salmon and cultured vegan butter from Savour Ltd.</p>
<p>The awards, now in their 32nd year, showcase the best New Zealand has to offer in the food and beverage industry and celebrate the creative innovations from Kiwi food and beverage manufacturers, from artisanal products through to large-scale companies.</p>
<p>The finalist lineup includes several winners from previous years, including Barker’s of Geraldine, the Pure Food Co, Epic Brewing Company and Proper Crisps.</p>
<p>Sixty-seven products from 54 companies are finalists this year, across 11 categories including Artisan, Novel Food or Beverage and Business Innovation. One of the category winners will be announced as the Massey University Supreme Award winner, at the Gala Dinner in Auckland in October.</p>
<p>Massey University Vice-Chancellor Professor Jan Thomas says the University is extremely proud of the role the awards have had in showcasing excellence and innovation in food and beverage production for the past three decades.</p>
<p>“We know New Zealanders are regarded as world leaders in this sphere and it is right that we remind ourselves each year just how extraordinarily talented and creative the people in our food sector are – and celebrate their achievements,” Professor Thomas says.</p>

<p>“Every year we are impressed by the calibre of the finalists and 2018 is no exception. The awards provide local producers with the opportunity to elevate their business on a global scale.”</p>
<p>The New Zealand Food Awards expert judging panel includes celebrity judges <em>Bite</em> magazine’s Ray McVinnie, chef Geoff Scott, World Kitchen television host and chef Nici Wickes, and New Zealand’s only certified cicerone (beer expert), Josh Scott.</p>
<p>Innovation was also a key theme again this year, Ms Wickes says. “Our finalists this year have just blown our socks off with the amount of innovation, and I&#39;m not talking about crazy inventions with food – it&#39;s about taking a quality New Zealand product and then adding some value to it, to make it even more fantastic.”</p>
<p>Geoff Scott says among the hundreds of entries, there was one stand-out moment for him during judging. “We had a rather creative piece entered, which was an amazing frozen confectionary item. It definitely drew a lot of comments from the judges and actually, apart from being a real stand-out beautiful piece, it also tasted amazing.”</p>
<p>Winning products are eligible to use the New Zealand Food Awards “Quality Mark”, which highlights the superiority of products to both consumers and industry, and can help boost sales and distribution domestically and internationally.</p>
