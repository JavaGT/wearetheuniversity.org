<p>Poet and memoir writer Kate Camp will give this year&#39;s Frank Sargeson Memorial lecture at the University of Waikato next Monday September 10th.</p>
<p>Kate starting writing memoir when she was in France on the Katherine Mansfield Menton Fellowship in 2017 and found it raised lots of questions; about fact and fiction, ethics and ego, what one hides and what one chooses to reveal. Her Waikato lecture follows on from that asking why bother with memoir at all?</p>
<p>&quot;Who could possibly be interested in the lino of my childhood kitchen, or the throat-catch feeling of my first cigarette?&quot; asks Kate.</p>
<p>&quot;And yet, other than memory, what are we? What could be more fascinating, more profound, than the grains of human detail that make up any one existence?<br>In this lecture I will circle around these questions, through the lens of my own work, and the work of other New Zealand writers.”</p>
<p>With her trademark mix of intellect and irreverence, she considers whether memoir writing is a symptom of modern self-obsession, or a profound way to access what it means to be human.</p>
<p>The Annual Frank Sargeson Memorial Lecture hosted jointly by the University of Waikato and the Friends of Hamilton Public Library commemorates one of New Zealand&#39;s most important writers.</p>
<p>Frank Sargeson was born in London Street, Hamilton in 1903. He trained as a solicitor and travelled in Europe before settling in Takapuna on Auckland&#39;s North Shore, where he devoted his life to his writing, to his garden, and to mentoring younger writers: most famously, Janet Frame wrote her first novel <em>Owls Do Cry</em> in an army hut in his back garden. More than any other writer, Sargeson captured a working-class New Zealand vernacular, and the society that gave rise to it. His influential and quintessentially Kiwi work was published around the world.</p>
