<p><strong>Minister Sage forced to postpone her tahr hunt</strong></p>
<p>Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage has been forced to postpone the mass tahr cull she ordered to start this weekend because of huge pressure from recreational hunting and tourism industry, National’s Conservation spokesperson Sarah Dowie says.</p>
<p>“Ms Sage personally ordered the culling of tens of thousands of tahr without adequately consulting with the hunting industry and recreational hunters who would be directly affected.</p>
<p>“While I welcome the fact that Ms Sage has delayed her cull this weekend, I am disappointed it has come to this.</p>
<p>“While National supports managing tahr numbers the Minister has no excuses for not adequately consulting with the hunting industry and recreational hunters.</p>
<p>“The hunting sector is advocating a responsible plan to manage tahr numbers rather than the slaughter of tens of thousands of animals. If Ms Sage had properly consulted, she would have a better understanding of this.</p>
<p>“Ms Sage must halt the cull until she has listened to advice from hunting representatives like the New Zealand Deerstalkers Association who have proposed a managed hunter-led population reduction over three years.</p>
<p>“Almost 23,000 concerned New Zealanders have signed my petition calling on her to stop the cull. She must listen to them.&quot;</p>
