<p><strong>Wednesday, 26 September 2018, 12:05 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>A University of Canterbury (UC) law professor warns that New Zealand’s limited enforcement of a global Anti-Bribery convention may leave us open to organised crime and corruption.</p>
<p>UC Law Professor John Hopkins warns that if New Zealand’s limited enforcement of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)’s Anti-Bribery convention continues, we may find ourselves targeted by organised crime and corruption.</p>
<p>In the new Transparency International report ‘Exporting corruption’, New Zealand was identified as one of 33 exporters (totalling 52% of world exports) that have limited to no enforcement against foreign bribery.</p>
<p>Professor Hopkins, a director of Transparency International New Zealand (TINZ) and one of the report’s authors, found that while New Zealand had a deserved reputation for integrity, there is much work still to do.</p>
<p>“We are still one of the countries that turns a blind eye to bribery when it occurs overseas.”</p>
<p>One example of this is that the law here continues to allow ‘facilitation payments’ – a practice which “undermines good practice and our good name”.</p>
<p>He encourages the government to tighten the law and better resource enforcement agencies to ensure overseas criminals cannot abuse New Zealand’s reputation.</p>
<p>“Although domestic corruption in New Zealand appears low, we really need to up our game in the way we respond to the threat of international corruption,” Professor Hopkins says.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is widely regarded as one of the least corrupt countries but we need to make sure our international approach lines up with that.”</p>
<p>Transparency International is the global civil society organisation against corruption. It is a non-political, non-partisan and not-for-profit incorporated society with charitable status.</p>
