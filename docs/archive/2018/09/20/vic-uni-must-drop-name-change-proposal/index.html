<p><strong>Thursday, 20 September 2018, 4:31 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Vic Uni must drop name-change proposal</p>
<p>National List MP based in Wellington Central Nicola Willis says Victoria University should quit spinning and listen to the students, alumni and staff who overwhelmingly oppose its name-change proposal.</p>
<p>“Documents released today show 75 per cent of submissions received by the University on its name change opposed the proposal.</p>
<p>“This backs-up what online polls, petitions and Wellingtonians have already told me.</p>
<p>“The University should dump this ill-conceived and unpopular idea.</p>
<p>“It’s disappointing to see the University has engaged in a disingenuous spin campaign rather than listening to its community.</p>
<p>“Vic Uni appears to have released cherry-picked statistics to media outlets in an effort to drum up support for their plan. The truth is most students and alumni are opposed to this change.</p>
<p>“Even if the University Council finalises this recommendation next week the Minister of Education has the final say. The Minister cannot sign-off on the change without proof of “demonstrable support” from staff, students and graduates. The Minister must reject this idea.</p>
<p>“As a Vic graduate I, like many Wellingtonians, feel strongly about this and will keep fighting it. We should stick with Vic.”</p>
