<p><strong>Former Otago University student only kiwi on prestigious <em>Forbes</em> list</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Thursday 29 March 2018</strong>  </p>
<p>Former University of Otago student, 27 year old Sam Stuchbury, has this week become the only New Zealander named on the prestigious <em>Forbes</em> “30 Under 30” list of 2018.</p>
<p>The official website for the “30 Under 30” list describes it as an “annual encyclopedia of creative disruption featuring 600 young stars in 20 different industries” that “continues to spotlight the inspiring and the (genuinely) enviable.”</p>
<p>Founder and creative director of the Motion Sickness creative agency, and also The Social club influencer marketplace platform, Stuchbury learned he was on the list on Wednesday (28/3), named in the “Asia, Media Marketing and Advertising” category.</p>
<p>“A few months ago they got in touch to let me know I’d been nominated. I didn’t hear anything back until yesterday when they contacted me to say I was on the list. I’m stoked, and to be the only kiwi is great,” Mr Stuchbury says.</p>
<p>Mr Stuchbury, who originates from and now lives in Auckland, studied at the University of Otago between 2010 and 2014. He founded Motion Sickness in his final university year, having noticed opportunities in the social media/content space.</p>
<p>Armed with a Bachelor of Consumer Applied Science and Communication Design from the University of Otago, Mr Stuchbury built the Motion Sickness agency from scratch.</p>

<p>From humble beginnings in his Dunedin student flat, he says the company now employs eight full time staff along with a handful of contractors at their premises in central Auckland, has a client list involving New Zealand and international businesses, and a revenue stream reaching into seven figures.</p>
<p>He believes his time at Otago helped him realise his skill set, and where to apply it.</p>
<p>“We had freedom to work on projects that allow you the ability to figure out what you like and what you are good at - that is what I liked the most,” Mr Stuchbury says.</p>
<p>He has since been joined at Motion Sickness by fellow Otago alumni, Hilary Ngan Kee and Alex McManus, who are directors in the company.</p>
<p>Mr Stuchbury will head to Hong Kong in July for the <em>Forbes</em> “30 Under 30” summit.</p>
