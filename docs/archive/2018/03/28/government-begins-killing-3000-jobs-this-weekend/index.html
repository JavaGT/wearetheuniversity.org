<p>Government begins killing 3000 jobs this weekend</p>
<p>“By increasing the minimum wage to $16.50 an hour, the Government is condemning 3000 young, unskilled workers to the scrapheap”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>Official <a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17535&qid=5222869">analysis</a> by the Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment shows the ‘restraint on employment’ as a result of the minimum wage hike could be about 3000 jobs.</p>
<p>“In a classic example of good intentions and poor results, some of New Zealand&#39;s most vulnerable workers will be stripped of an opportunity to gain valuable skills and work experience.</p>
<p>“Official <a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17536&qid=5222869">advice</a> to the Minister of Finance also shows minimum wage increases don’t increase productivity or economic growth, and are a poor way of tackling poverty given being on the minimum wage is a transitional stage for many workers.</p>
<p>“The pressure on vulnerable workers will only increase as the Government commits to a minimum wage of $20 an hour by 2021.</p>
<p>“New Zealand already has one of the highest minimum wages in the Western world. This means that the potential for job losses in future is even greater.</p>
<p>“The Government must instead focus on the underlying drivers of a high-productivity, high-wage economy - most importantly, a world-class education system where parents and students have choice.</p>
<p>“Forcing businesses to pay workers more than those workers can produce is the simplest recipe for higher unemployment”, says Mr Seymour.</p>
