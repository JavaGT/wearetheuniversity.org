<p>Shooting champion Russia bound for sports volunteering</p>
<p>Despite being a newly-crowned national clay target shooting champion, Lincoln University sports scholar Kristy Havill’s love of volunteering is what has earned her a trip to Russia.</p>
<p>Kristy won a Ladies National Title at the NZ DTL Nationals last week and will represent New Zealand at the World DTL Championships in Wagga Wagga, Australia from 24-27 March.</p>
<p>However, in June the third-year Sport and Recreation Management student will be New Zealand’s sole representative at the International University Sports Federation (FISU) Volunteer Leader’s Academy in Kazan in June.</p>
<p>The Academy provides professional training for young leaders in the volunteer movement, targeting students around the world that promote sport and event volunteering in their university and region</p>
<p>In between stints at the firing range Kristy is a team leader and coach for the Forward Foundation which aims to increase participation in girls’ sport, president of the Lincoln University Recreation Society – a student-run club that encourages work experience opportunities, and is on the Metro Sports Facility Management and Operations Advisory Group, which is involved in developing the major sports venue in central Christchurch.</p>
<p>She has coached and umpired touch rugby, volleyball, netball and cricket since she was a 14-year-old at Rangi Ruru Girls’ School. She also plays premier women’s cricket for Lancaster Park and is an assistant coach of the girls’ team there.</p>

<p>“It’s what other people get out of my volunteering that makes it special. I like to see people for who they are – volunteering allows me to work with new people and help them to set and achieve their goals. If I can help just one person, it’s totally worth it,” she said.</p>
<p>“Sport is my number one passion and I know that without volunteers it simply can’t function. I strongly believe that everybody should be encouraged to volunteer to allow sport to develop.</p>
<p>“It may not always be obvious straight away, but volunteering can benefit people after they graduate, in work and other areas of their life.”</p>
<p>At the Academy she will have practical training on topics such as volunteer recruitment, developing leadership skills and organising a volunteer programme for a real FISU event, as well as visiting sport venues in Russia.</p>
<p>Tertiary Sport New Zealand (UTSNZ) is responsible for facilitating New Zealand’s involvement in the Academy.</p>
<p>Its Executive Director, Sarah Anderson, was impressed with the depth and breadth of Kristy’s application.</p>
<p>“It is obvious that Kristy derives a lot of satisfaction from giving back to many sporting communities. We are sure her work ethic, eagerness to contribute, and ability to create inclusive environments will stand her in good stead at the Academy.”</p>
