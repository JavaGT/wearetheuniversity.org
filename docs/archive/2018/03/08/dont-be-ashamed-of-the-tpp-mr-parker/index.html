<p>Don’t be ashamed of the TPP Mr Parker</p>
<p>National Party Trade spokesperson Todd McClay says New Zealand exporters can rejoice as Trade Minister David Parker and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters hang up their TPP protest signs with the signing of the revised TPP trade agreement in Chile tomorrow.</p>
<p>“This is an important deal for New Zealand, which is fundamentally the same deal that was signed in Auckland in 2016. It increases access to millions of consumers around the world in markets including Japan, Mexico and Canada,” Mr McClay says.</p>
<p>“Many thousands of New Zealanders will feel let down by the Labour/New Zealand First Government signing the revised TPP given the strength of their protest against the agreement whilst in Opposition.</p>
<p>“The revised TPP will create opportunities for our exporters, boost jobs and livelihoods and put New Zealanders in an even greater position to succeed on the international stage.</p>
<p>“I would like to acknowledge the thousands of hours of hard work put in over 10 years by our world-class trade officials and in particular chief TPP negotiators David Walker and Vangelis Vitalis. They have played a pivotal role along with other New Zealanders who have supported this agreement.</p>
<p>“It is good that Labour and New Zealand First have finally decided to act in New Zealand’s best interests in spite of their fierce opposition to the deal when it was negotiated under National.</p>
<p>“Two and a half Trade Ministers have been involved with TPP since negotiations began. Mr Parker can make it three by stopping his apologies for Labour’s opposition to TPP.”</p>
