<p>Prime Minister of Vietnam to make landmark visit to University of Waikato</p>
<p>The University of Waikato is strengthening its international ties with Vietnam, welcoming Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc to its Hamilton campus.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and his delegation will be at the University on Wednesday 14 March, 2018.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato already has a strong relationship with Vietnam, and is working with a number of key Ministries and tertiary institutions in partnerships that span Management, Law, Education, Security and Computer Science.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Neil Quigley has been working to build the education relationship between New Zealand and Vietnam for more than 15 years, and has received awards for this work from both the Government of Vietnam and Vietnamese universities. Prime Minister Phuc’s visit is an opportunity to continue to build that relationship between the University of Waikato and a number of Vietnamese universities and government agencies.</p>
<p>“The University of Waikato is welcoming a growing number of students from Vietnam, and some of our own students are also having life-changing experiences through opportunities to visit the country. The successful educational collaboration is one we are proud of, and committed to expanding in the future. We are also working in partnership with the Vietnam Government and Vietnamese tertiary institutions on development, including training academic staff to return to their home country with greater skills as educators and leaders.”</p>
<p>During the visit the Vice-Chancellor and Prime Minister will sign three new Memorandums of Understanding. Prime Minister Phuc will also meet with Vietnamese students attending the University, Waikato students who have studied in Vietnam, and key local leaders.</p>
