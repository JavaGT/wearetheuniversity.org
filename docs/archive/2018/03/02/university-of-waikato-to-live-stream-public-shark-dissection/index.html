<p><strong>Friday, 2 March 2018, 11:31 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato">University of Waikato</a></strong></p>
<p>Sharks inspire both fascination and fear. This weekend University of Waikato scientists will give people an ‘inside view’ of a shark dissection, dispelling some of the myths surrounding the top predator while also contributing to knowledge of shark biology.</p>
<p>The 2.54 metre long bronze whaler (<em>Carcharhinus brachyurus</em>) was found on the beach on the Whangaparaoa Peninsula last year and is believed to have died after being caught in a fishing net. It was donated by the Department of Conservation and the Auckland Museum to the University’s Coastal Marine Field Station.</p>
<p>The dissection will take place in Tauranga on Saturday 03 March 2018, and will be carried out by University of Waikato marine biologists. It will run from 2pm until approximately 4:30pm. It is also part of Seaweek and the Bay of Plenty Regional Council Toi Moana Happy Harbour Fun Day.</p>
<p>The first half of the dissection will focus on the bronze whaler’s external features such as the fins, teeth, gills and skin, along with the shark’s six senses and brain. The second half will focus on the liver, stomach, kidneys and reproductive organs. What scientists find inside the shark’s stomach may be quite intriguing.</p>
<p>The live stream will be available through the University of Waikato’s Facebook page.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This event is weather dependent.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato&#39;s researchers are providing unique perspectives on issues of importance to contemporary society, and answers to some of the key problems being faced by industries, governments and nations around the world.</p>
