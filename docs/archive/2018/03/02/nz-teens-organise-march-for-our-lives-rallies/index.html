<p>New Zealand Teens Organise March for Our Lives Rallies Across New Zealand</p>
<p>A passionate group of young university students have organised March For Our Lives sister rallies in four different New Zealand cities to support marches in the U.S.</p>
<p>March For Our Lives New Zealand is organising four sister rallies to take place on 24 March in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin. The locations of these Marches are in the process of being confirmed, but the tentative venues are as follows: Albert Park (Auckland), Parliament House (Wellington), Cathedral Square (Christchurch), and Union Hall (Dunedin).</p>
<p>These rallies are intended to show solidarity with, and support to, the students in the United States as they march in various cities to demand that their lives and safety become a priority. The events have also been recognised by the original movement, as seen on: <a href="https://event.marchforourlives.com/event/march-our-lives-events/search/">https://event.marchforourlives.com/event/march-our-lives-events/search/</a></p>
<p>The organising group is a diverse group of Americans and Kiwis, driven by a core group of passionate teenagers.</p>
<p><em>&quot;That&#39;s what makes this movement different to the next one; it&#39;s enabling youth worldwide to get their voice heard, and demanding that our lives be placed into our hands, as they should have been in the first place.”</em><br><em>– Aniket Chawla, 18, event organiser</em>  </p>
<p>The Facebook page “March For Our Lives – New Zealand” has hundreds of likes and counting, signifying strong support from the Kiwi community.<br>Additionally, earlier this week, UNICEF and Women’s March Aotearoa have offered their backing and support. UNICEF’s Youth Participation Manager, Jacqui Southey, had this to say:</p>

<p>_“The rights of children to be safe at school must take precedence over politics, profits and special interests. Gun reform in the United States is desperately needed to prevent the deaths of any more children due to gun violence. It is only right that it is young people leading on this issue, and we support the young people who are leading the charge in demanding change.”<br>_<br>The March organisers are encouraging New Zealanders to march with them, so collective and global voices in support of the March for our Lives movement will be heard. They will also be inviting prominent members of our society, e.g. MPs, police officers, and principals, to speak at the events, and share their views on the issue.</p>
