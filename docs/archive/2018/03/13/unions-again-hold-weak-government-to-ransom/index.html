<p>Unions again hold weak Government to ransom</p>
<p>The unions are clearly taking the new Labour-led Government for a ride with yet another strike underway today led by the Rail and Maritime Transport Union, National Party MPs Michael Woodhouse and Jami-Lee Ross say.</p>
<p>“We are seeing another union power grab with strike action at Lyttelton Port from midnight last night. The culprit is again the Rail and Maritime Transport Union, the same Union behind the extremely disruptive train and bus strikes in Auckland,” Workplace Relations Spokesperson Michael Woodhouse says.</p>
<p>“This strike has the potential to be particularly significant, with warnings that it may shut down the port and that if it continues past a week, shortages of some critical supplies will begin to occur affecting thousands of people and businesses.</p>
<p>“This is not good enough. With union demands increasing at an alarming rate, these strikes are starting to become more common. This is now the fifth major strike within the first four months of a Labour-led Government.</p>
<p>“The unions know that the more disruption they cause, the more likely they are to force the Government to side with their excessive demands.</p>
<p>“I doubt this is the last time our transport industries will be held to ransom by unions. New Zealanders who rely on coastal transport need certainty of service, not strikes,” National Party Transport Spokesperson Jami-Lee Ross says.</p>
<p>“The transport sector is bearing the brunt of unions flexing their muscles with the new Government.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s commuters or exporters, they are all being inconvenienced by the Rail and Maritime Transport Union’s actions.</p>
<p>“Strike action will only get worse when Labour’s pro-union law changes take effect later this year,” Mr Woodhouse says.</p>
