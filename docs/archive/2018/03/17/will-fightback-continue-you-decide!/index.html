<p><strong>Saturday, 17 March 2018, 6:50 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Fightback">Fightback</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Will Fightback Continue? You Decide!</strong></p>
<p>Since 2012, <em>Fightback</em> has produced media for the socialist and radical Left in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Our work has alsoreached outside this country; some of our material has been translated into other languages, and republished as far afield as Austria and Ukraine.</p>
<p>We’ve aimed to provide analysis and information which bridges the gap between the world of academic journals and the world of activists on the street. We’ve attempted to apply cutting-edge social justice theory to the everyday movements against capitalism and the capitalist, colonial, patriarchal state in this country.</p>
<p>We don’t uphold any particular ideological “dogma”. Instead, we have tried to synthesize the best that the Marxist tradition has to offer with the insights of the queer/trans, feminist, and tino rangatira literature.</p>
<p>In the past few years in particular, we’ve produced “special issues” (on Women, Youth activism and Pasefika activism in particular) which have not only solicited writing from outside the “usual suspects” of the Marxist left, but successfully fundraised so that contributors could be reimbursed for their work, something which is disturbingly rare even on the radical left.<br>**But if you want all this to continue, it’s time to contribute. Fightback needs your financial support or we will cease to exist. It’s that simple.<br>**<br>Our most recent conference decided to make the push for Fightback to become a <em>trans-Tasman journal of the radical and activist Left</em>. In the modern era of free movement across the Tasman, “Australasia” is becoming a reality in a way it has not been since the 19th century. So many New Zealanders (tauiwi as well as tangata whenua) now live and work in Australia – and decisions made in one country increasingly impact the other, as the inter-governmental controversy surrounding the Manus Island detention camp shows.</p>

<p>We wish to crucially engage socialists from both sides of the Tasman – in particular, socialists from Aotearoa living and working in Australia – to continue the lines of analysis and directions of organisation which we have being pursuing. Beyond the dogmas of “sect Marxism”; beyond national boundaries; towards a genuinely decolonized, democratic, feminist and queer-friendly anti-capitalism.</p>
<p>This will cost money. In New Zealand terms, <strong>we will need at least $3,000</strong> to continue our schedule of producing 4 print magazines a year, including paying writers for a Special Issue on Accessibility. <strong>Our minimum goal – $1,100</strong> – would cover an online-only media project including an e-publication, also paying writers for the Accessibility issue.<br><em>The financial question is a political question.</em> If what Fightback has been doing since 2012 is of value to socialists in Aotearoa/New Zealand – and if our vision for the future inspires people on both sides of the Tasman – then our friends and comrades simply <em>have</em> to put their money where their sympathies lie. Otherwise, <strong>the project will come to an end this year</strong>. It really is as simple as that.</p>
<p>If you like what we do, please support our crowdfunding appeal, to the extent you possibly can. And if you can’t support financially – please, raise your hand to help us with writing, web design, proof reading or the thousand and one other little jobs that unpaid volunteers have been doing over the last six years. We really look forward to hearing from you.</p>
