<p>Wagner thanks Bishop Matthews for her service</p>
<p>National’s Greater Christchurch Regeneration spokesperson Nicky Wagner has expressed her thanks to Bishop Victoria Matthews for her service to Christchurch, following news of her intention to step down.</p>
<p>“I was somewhat surprised this afternoon when Bishop Matthews told me of her decision to step down on May 1st, and I want to both wish her well for the future and thank her for her service to Christchurch.</p>
<p>“Over the past ten years she has been a steadfast and devoted bishop for Canterbury’s Anglicans and shown a true commitment and love to those she serves.</p>
<p>“I worked particularly closely with the Bishop last year on the reinstatement of the Cathedral, and I really appreciated the time and energy she put into those discussions. We met regularly, and always had thoughtful, productive discussions that were focussed on finding solutions.</p>
<p>“As the Minister for Greater Christchurch Regeneration at the time, the Bishop and I worked together to reach a decision on the future of the Christ Church Cathedral. It was agreed that the Cathedral be reinstated and this project is now underway.</p>
<p>“I thank her for the years of hard work through challenging times, and the leadership she has shown, and I wish all the best for the future,” Mrs Wagner says.</p>
