<p><strong>Tuesday, 7 August 2018, 10:02 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>&quot;Massey University Vice-Chancellor Jan Thomas should resign after cowardly barring Don Brash from speaking at the University&quot;, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>&quot;After veiled threats from a left-wing thug in a letter to the Vice-Chancellor, she capitulated this morning and prevented Dr Brash from speaking on ‘security’ grounds.</p>
<p>&quot;A student wrote to the Vice-Chancellor: “I look forward to hearing what your thoughts are on this matter and steps you will take to ensure the safety of those attending. Remember in light of their type of &quot;Free Speech&quot; does not come Free of Consequences.’”</p>
<p>Brash, a former Reserve Bank Governor and Opposition Leader, was due to speak to the Politics Society tomorrow.</p>
<p>&quot;I have long feared that American-style anti-intellectual, violent intolerance would come here.</p>
<p>&quot;It has appeared at Massey this week and the university has completely failed to the test.</p>
<p>&quot;Education Minister Chris Hipkins should follow the British and defund universities that do not protect freedom of speech in their campuses.</p>
<p>&quot;Universities exist to promote robust debate, educate, and search for the truth.</p>
<p>&quot;They do not exist to coddle students and protect them from views they might disagree with.</p>
<p>&quot;Hipkins must take action against publicly-funded universities that fail to protect free speech. Professor Thomas should resign immediately.</p>
