<p><strong>Ancient afterlife after dark Classics talk and museum tour prove popular</strong></p>
<p>A night-time public lecture about the ancient Greek afterlife, by University of Canterbury (UC) Classical scholars, in the Teece Museum of Classical Antiquities at the UC Arts City location has reached capacity, with all seats allocated weeks in advance.</p>
<p>This unique, two-part event, created especially for the UC Connect public lecture series, will begin with an illustrated lecture – <em>Alone of all the Gods: Concepts of Death and the Afterlife in Ancient Greece</em> – by UC’s Head of Classics, Senior Lecturer Dr Patrick O’Sullivan.</p>
<p>Beginning with a discussion of Hades and his realm, this talk will also look at a wide range of Greek attitudes to death and the afterlife: from Homer’s idea of heroic death in battle and its bitter costs, to reincarnation in the philosophies of Pythagoras and Plato, to figures such as Dionysus and Persephone who are linked to death and renewal – and more.</p>
<p>Following the lecture, guests will have the opportunity to experience the Teece Museum’s newest exhibition <em>‘Beyond the Grave: Death in ancient times’</em>, which explores concepts of death in Greek and Roman art and literature. Curator Terri Elder will give a brief introductory talk about the exhibition, and discuss a few special pieces included in it.</p>
