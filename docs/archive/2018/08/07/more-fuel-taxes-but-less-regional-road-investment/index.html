<p><strong>Tuesday, 7 August 2018, 5:31 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>7 August 2018</strong></p>
<p><strong>More fuel taxes but less regional road investment</strong></p>
<p>The Government needs to continue National’s record of investing in our transport network instead oftaxing New Zealanders more and driving our industries overseas, National’s Transport spokesperson Jami-Lee Ross says.</p>
<p>“Our transport sector is slowing down as Transport Minister Phil Twyford imposes new taxes while also cutting funding for new roading projects,” Mr Ross says.</p>
<p>“This is not only resulting in higher costs for New Zealanders but is also threatening the infrastructure pipeline for future projects.</p>
<p>“Industry leaders are already warning the Government that their cuts to funding will see our contractors and engineers looking for work elsewhere.</p>
<p>“On top of that, New Zealanders are set to pay an extra $1.24 billion in fuel taxes over the next three years, but they’re not going to see the investment that was promised and is needed in our regions.</p>
<p>“National had an ambitious $12 billion investment programme in our Roads of National Significance. National committed to continue this investment into our regions as part of our additional $10 billion next-generation of Roads of National Significance.</p>
<p>“Despite assurances, Labour has placed these projects under threat with the pre-existing Otaki to Levin project being placed under re-evaluation by NZTA because of Labour’s transport policies.</p>
<p>“We also know that projects National committed to in Northland, the Bay of Plenty, the Waikato, the Manawatu, Wellington and Canterbury are all being traded in so that Auckland can get a new tram-set.</p>
<p>“Regional New Zealand is paying more and missing out on investment for their communities to fund a half-planned and half-funded tram set.</p>
<p>“Instead of imposing taxes, cutting roading projects and driving our industries overseas, the Government should get on with ensuring our communities receive the projects that are desperately needed in our regions.”</p>
