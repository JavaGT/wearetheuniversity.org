<p><strong>University of Otago to build new dental teaching facility in South Auckland</strong>  </p>
<p>The University of Otago is building a dental teaching facility and patient treatment clinic in South Auckland to help meet high health needs, while providing students with wide-ranging learning opportunities in a diverse community.</p>
<p>University of Otago Vice-Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne says by making a real difference to people’s lives and a community’s health and wellbeing, the University will be living its strategic commitment to providing for the national good and improving lives.</p>
<p>The University is also committed to helping develop students into good citizens and this project will create a community-focused experience that involves thoughtful giving and service, Professor Hayne says.</p>
<p>The $28.2 million, two-storey, 32-chair building will be built upon land owned by the Counties Manukau District Health Board at its Manukau Super Clinic on Great South Road.</p>
<p>Not only will the Faculty of Dentistry regularly consult the community to find out what it needs from the clinics then work to deliver that, the Faculty will also provide a wide range of outreach activities, Professor Hayne says.</p>
<p>Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Division of Health Sciences, Professor Paul Brunton, says the project is a win-win situation for both the local community and the University.</p>
<p>“Patients are contributing to the education of the country’s future dentists and, in exchange, they have access to high-quality dental care.”</p>

<p>The Counties Manukau dental teaching facility and patient treatment clinic will follow the long-standing social contract model operated successfully in Dunedin, where patients receive treatment provided by students under supervision at a highly accessible cost, Professor Brunton says.</p>
<p>Forty-eight final-year Bachelor of Dental Surgery students will be assigned to the Counties Manukau facility at any one time.</p>
<p>Professor Brunton says treating people in Counties Manukau is only possible because of a much-valued relationship with the district health board, which led to the two institutions signing a Memorandum of Understanding in November 2014 so they could work together to achieve mutual goals.</p>
<p>“The new facility will not only provide students with diverse practical learning opportunities but also increase their understanding of people from a wide range of backgrounds,” Professor Brunton says.</p>
<p>The project will strengthen relationships and partnerships with Māori and Pacific communities as well, based on mutually beneficial goals incorporating patient care, research and education.</p>
<p>Having an Auckland base in an area home to a large number of oral healthcare professionals will also make it easier for them to access continuing education opportunities.</p>
<p>The facility could help meet international demand for upskilling dentists as well, because Auckland is so accessible.</p>
<p>Chief Operating Officer Stephen Willis says design work is already underway and work should start on the site later this year, with the aim of completing the project in 2020.</p>
