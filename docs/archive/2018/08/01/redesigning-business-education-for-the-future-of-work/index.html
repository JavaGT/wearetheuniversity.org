<p>AUT Business School and the School of Economics are refreshing the Bachelor of Business to ensure its students continue to be equipped with the knowledge and skills to succeed in a rapidly changing business world.</p>
<p>Business leaders tell us they need graduates to be agile, creative and able to work effectively across different functions in a business, says Professor Kate Kearins, Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean, Faculty of Business, Economics and Law.</p>
<p>“We have optimised our already very effective business degree to ensure our graduates are ready to thrive in the ever-changing world of work,” she says.</p>
<p>From 2019 students enrolling in the flagship Bachelor of Business will be embarking on a programme of study, developed in conjunction with industry leaders, that lets students study multidisciplinary subjects alongside a business specialisation.</p>
<p>“As a university we set ourselves apart with a teaching philosophy that prioritises student engagement and emphasises action-based learning experiences,” says Professor Kearins.</p>
<p>“At the heart of our teaching and research is collaboration with business, the professions and the community.”</p>
<p>All students will undertake workplace experience, either through a work placement, an applied research project or by starting a business venture before graduating. Many students are graduating with a job offer secured from their placement.</p>
<p>A focus on social impact is one of the enhancements made to the Bachelor of Business. By studying contemporary issues students consider ethical approaches to business decision-making and problem solving, and develop an enhanced understanding and appreciation of what it means to practice business in a responsible way.</p>
<p>“We want to inspire our students to make a difference in the business world and beyond,” Professor Kearins says.</p>
