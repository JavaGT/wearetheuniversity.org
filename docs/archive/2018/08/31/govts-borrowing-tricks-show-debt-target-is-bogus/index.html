<p><strong>Friday, 31 August 2018, 1:58 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Govt’s borrowing tricks show debt target is bogus</p>
<p>The Government’s claim to be fiscally responsible while making extravagant spending</p>
<p>promises has been shown up as bogus, with the Treasury confirming it had deep concerns about debt hidden off-balance sheet, National’s Finance spokesperson Amy Adams says.</p>
<p>“The Government has claimed it will reduce net core Crown debt to 20 per cent of GDP – but they’re doing this by hiding billions of extra borrowing in Crown entities like Housing NZ.</p>
<p>“Documents released this week show Treasury was pushing back on the hidden borrowing, saying it could hurt the credibility of the Government’s fiscal strategy, harm New Zealand’s reputation as a borrower, lift interest costs and lead rating agencies to conclude it was ‘an attempt to circumvent the net core Crown debt target.’</p>
<p>“That’s an extraordinary list of concerns. In fact, Treasury even went so far as to say the move would undermine the credibility of the budget responsibility rules themselves.</p>
<p>“This goes straight to the heart of the Government’s fiscal credibility because it set the debt target in an attempt to counter concerns about its lack of economic credentials.</p>
<p>“Meeting the target was already looking improbable but now it also smacks of sleight of hand. This week NZIER predicted that the Government would fall $2 billion short of meeting its self-imposed debt target – and that’s before you factor in the extra $6 billion of off-balance sheet debt buried in the small print of Budget 2018.</p>

<p>“The Government has needed to massively increase spending and borrowing because it over-promised and hadn’t budgeted properly.</p>
<p>“Added to that is a pattern of poor investment decisions – with things like billions for New Zealand First’s pet projects and a tertiary fees-free policy that isn’t delivering any extra students.</p>
<p>“National believes in sensible, consistent economic policies that encourage businesses to grow and it wants New Zealanders to keep more of what they earn. That may seem old-fashioned to this Government’s out-of-touch Ministers but it is the path to prosperity.”</p>
