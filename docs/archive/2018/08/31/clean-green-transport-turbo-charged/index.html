<p><strong>Clean, green transport turbo charged</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party is celebrating today’s $16.9 billion transport announcement which delivers a record breaking level of investment in sustainable, green transport.</p>
<p>“For the last ten years, modern public transport, walking and cycling and road safety have taken a back seat to costly motorway projects,” said Green Party Co-leader Marama Davidson.</p>
<p>“Today, with the Greens in Government, we’re seeing the largest ever investment in sustainable transport, with $4.2 billion to be invested across public transport, metro rail, and walking and cycling.</p>
<p>“This is a game changing level of investment that will deliver faster, more frequent buses and trains and expanded networks of safe cycleways in our town and cities.</p>
<p>“This investment will help make our cities easier and more affordable to get around by bus, car, bike, and on foot. It’ll mean fewer traffic-clogged streets, more public space, and ultimately a cleaner, greener transport system that is better for people and the planet,” said Ms Davidson.</p>
<p>The National Land Transport Programme for 2018-21 will see $16.9 billion invested in transport nationally.</p>
<p>It includes a record $3.9 billion in public transport and rail, a $1.9b increase on the previous three years. This includes:<br>• $470 million to be invested in rapid transit projects like extending Auckland’s Northern Busway and beginning new light rail lines to Mangere and the North-Western suburbs.<br>• $376 million in metro rail projects nationwide, including the renewal of large sections of the Wellington to Kapiti, Hutt Valley and Wairarapa passenger rail lines, new electric trains in Auckland and electrification of Auckland’s southern rail line to Pukekohe.<br>• $3 billion in public transport services and infrastructure improvements like new bus lanes, park and ride, and integrated ticketing.<br>$390 million will be invested in safe walking and cycling projects nationwide, a $96 million increase on the previous three years. This includes:<br>• $149 million in Auckland (a 30% increase), including delivery of the major Skypath and Seapath projects and Glen Innes to Tamaki Drive.<br>• $83 million for walking and cycling in Wellington (a 250% increase), including funding for the Eastern Bays cycleway and the development of the Wellington to Hutt ValleyWalking and Cycling Link.<br>• $34 million for walking and cycling in Christchurch to expand the cycle and pedestrian friendly areas in the city and continue investment in the 13 Mayor Cycleways.<br>• $56 million for Otago and Southland (a 600% increase), including the SH1 separated cycle lanes, SH88 Shared path and Peninsula Connection.</p>
