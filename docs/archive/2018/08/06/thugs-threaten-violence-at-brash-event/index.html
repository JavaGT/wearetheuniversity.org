<p><strong>Thugs threaten violence at Brash event</strong></p>
<p>Left-wing thugs at Massey University are threatening to banish former Reserve Bank Governor and Opposition Leader Don Brash by threats of violence, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=18023&qid=5596979">In a Facebook post</a>, one person menacingly wrote that the Vice-Chancellor should &#39;ensure the safety of those attending’ and that free speech &#39;does not come free of consequences’.</p>
<p>The Massey University Politics Society has invited Dr Brash to speak as part of its Past, Present and Future series. Tomorrow, the University’s Vice-Chancellor will decide whether to let him speak.</p>
<p>&quot;If it is true that the Vice-Chancellor of a publicly-funded university is considering blocking a former Reserve Bank Governor from speaking, it is simply outrageous.</p>
<p>&quot;I have long feared that the kind of anti-intellectual, violent intolerance that we see from students on American campuses would come here. Sadly, it has made landfall at Massey University this week.</p>
<p>&quot;I have personally known Don for seven years. I don&#39;t believe there’s a racist bone in his body.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Brash has given decades of public service to this country.</p>
<p>“Left-wing thugs have decided that, simply because they don’t like Dr Brash’s views, they will deprive Massey students of hearing him speak.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea that a former Reserve Bank Governor and Leader of the Opposition could be prevented from speaking at a publicly-funded university is otherworldly, but it is here today.</p>
<p>&quot;Our Minister of Education should follow the British and defund universities that do not protect freedom of speech from violence”, says Mr Seymour.</p>
