<p><strong>Thursday, 30 August 2018, 9:01 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT Leader David Seymour suggests the Government could cut its wasteful projects and instead bring Abby Hartley home.</p>
<p>Ms Hartley is fighting for her life in a Bali hospital with a condition for which she has no insurance.</p>
<p>“The current Government has splashed the cash from day one, and complained that there isn’t enough funding for core services.</p>
<p>“Well, here’s an opportunity for them to show they can prioritise the important stuff over wasteful spending.</p>
<p>Here are five examples of truly gobsmacking waste which could have been cut in order bring Ms Hartley back to New Zealand:</p>
<p>$500,000 for a nebulous and unnecessary Chief Technology Officer position<br>$250,000 for an Open Government and Government Digital Services Minister we don’t really need<br>$1 million for Victoria University to change its name because a few people confuse it with younger, poorer-quality universities<br>A $140,000 report which researched New Zealanders’ attitudes to sport, and which found that being active keeps them physically fit and healthy<br>$1.1 million for the State Services Commission’s gold-plated office fit out.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Government has created culture of excess. It means that there is less taxpayer money to care for New Zealanders in their time of need.</p>
