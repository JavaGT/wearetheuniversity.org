<p><strong>Thursday, 23 August 2018, 11:14 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/VUWSA">VUWSA</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Students ramp up their efforts against sexual violence with the launch of the #metoo VUW student blog.</strong>  </p>
<p>On Thursday 23 August, Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) will launch the #metoo vuw student blog (<a href="http://www.metoostudents.org.nz">www.metoostudents.org.nz</a>).</p>
<p>Following on from the success of Zoë Lawton’s blog collating stories of sexual violence and harassment in the legal profession, VUWSA will be asking current students and alumni from Victoria University of Wellington to share their stories in the hope of highlighting the urgent need for the university and wider Wellington community to create a safer environment for students.</p>
<p>Past and present students can share their experiences of sexual assault, harassment and discrimination perpetrated by staff, other students, colleagues and members of the public. The blog will be totally anonymous, authors and perpetrators will not be identified.</p>
<p>The blog will be open for submissions for one month, with stories being shared as they come in. There is also other information people can provide to help identify areas of the university or within Wellington where violence or harassment has occurred, so decision-makers have a place to start.</p>
<p>The website will be live from midnight, 22 August.</p>
<p><strong>Statement from VUWSA Welfare Vice President Bethany Paterson</strong>  </p>
<p><em>We want to be leaders in this space. It’s often too easy to say ‘that stuff doesn’t happen in my community’ but it does. This blog is about believing survivors, identifying problem areas and finding solutions. We want the courage of those people willing to share their stories to be a catalyst for change at a university, Wellington City and national government level.</em>  </p>
<p><em>We’re kidding ourselves if we think sexual violence, harassment and discrimination doesn’t play a factor in young people’s mental health. If you’re looking for an ambulance at the top of the cliff, having a safe community free from sexual violence would be it, or at the very least having a community that properly support victims.</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Statement from Zoë Lawton</strong>  </p>
<p><em>As a former student and staff member of Victoria University I am so proud of VUWSA for setting up a #metoo blog for past and present students to share their stories of sexual assault, harassment and discrimination. I hope that the Vice-Chancellor and others in the senior management team read the blog, engage in discussions with VUWSA and take positive steps to address the issues that are raised.</em>  </p>
