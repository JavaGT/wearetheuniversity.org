<p><strong>Thursday, 9 August 2018, 12:21 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>&quot;Massey Vice-Chancellor Jan Thomas has cost the University hundreds of enrolments with her position on free speech, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>In a Facebook poll of about 850 young people, 90 per cent of respondents believed Massey University’s restriction on free speech made it a less attractive place to study.</p>
<p>“It is around this time of year secondary school pupils decide what university they want to go to. The Vice-Chancellor should go on to Facebook and see how young people are turned off going to Massey.</p>
<p>&quot;Jan Thomas has made Massey the least attractive university in New Zealand. She is now a liability for the University, being prevented from speaking to media.</p>
<p>&quot;Massey is already struggling to attract students and top academics.</p>
<p>&quot;The Council of the University has a choice. They can make a stand for free speech and require Jan Thomas to extend an invitation to Dr Brash to speak, or next year the University Council can fire dozens of staff as student numbers and funding plummet.</p>
<p>&quot;When even our Prime Minister believes Massey is wrong to curtail free speech, the University has a serious student recruitment crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;Massey’s image problems will only get worse until Jan Thomas admits she is wrong to restrict free speech, apologises, and invites Dr Brash to speak at the University&quot;, says Mr Seymour.</p>
