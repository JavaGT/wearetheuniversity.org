<p><strong>Enrolments Continue to Strengthen at the University of Otago</strong></p>
<p>The University of Otago is now on track to record a roll increase of around 380 equivalent full-time students (EFTS) for 2018. Earlier in the year enrolments were tracking 300 EFTS ahead of the same time in 2017, but growth has strengthened further following a strong uptake for second semester courses and research degree study.</p>
<p>The latest figures show a 111 EFTS increase in full-fee international enrolment (a 7.5 per cent gain on 2017), and a 272 EFTS (1.6 per cent) rise in domestic EFTS.</p>
<p>First-year domestic and international enrolments are both up, by 262 EFTS (7.2 per cent) and 28 EFTS (15.8 per cent) respectively. Postgraduate taught enrolments are up by 62 EFTS, and postgraduate research enrolments by 52 EFTS.</p>
<p>University of Otago Vice Chancellor, Professor Harlene Hayne, says the positive figures are extremely heartening for everyone at the University.</p>
<p>“This level of growth is testament to the strong reputation built by the incredibly hard work of our talented staff and students in cementing Otago as a world-leading teaching and research university,” Professor Hayne says.</p>
<p>Overall growth in Health Sciences (230 EFTS, or 3.7 per cent), Humanities (113 EFTS, 2.4 per cent) and Sciences (92 EFTS, 2.1 per cent) has been partly offset by a decline in Commerce (53 EFTS, -1.8 per cent), though Commerce has secured international and postgraduate growth.</p>

<p>Growth this year has been accompanied by a further increase in the academic calibre of the University’s commencing cohort, as measured by the performance of Otago’s first-year students at school.</p>
<p>“With 2019 being Otago’s 150th Anniversary it is going to be a year of celebration and reflection on the University’s successes. I look forward to joining all students and staff in making it another proud year for this exceptional university,” adds Professor Hayne.</p>
<p>The above figures do not include enrolments though the University’s Foundation Studies subsidiary, which – at 270 EFTS - are marginally up on the same time in 2017.</p>
<p>With Foundation Studies enrolments included, Otago’s roll currently stands at 18,726 EFTS. A further 115 EFTS are forecast between now and the end of the year, primarily through further postgraduate enrolments. This should see Otago achieve a final enrolment of around 18,841 EFTS.</p>
