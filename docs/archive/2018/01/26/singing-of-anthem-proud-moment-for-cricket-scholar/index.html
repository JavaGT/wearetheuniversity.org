<p><strong>Friday, 26 January 2018, 3:31 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>Despite New Zealand tumbling out of the U19 Cricket World Cup after a loss to Afghanistan, and an early injury, Lincoln University cricket scholar Connor Sullivan has happy memories of the event.</p>
<p>“My highlight of the world cup so far, although being injured since the first game, would definitely have to be walking out on Bay Oval in Tauranga for the World Cup opener,” Connor said.</p>
<p>“Singing the anthem with the New Zealand uniform on before playing in what was a convincing win over the West Indies was definitely an experience I will never forget.”</p>
<p>Even though Lincoln will host 17 games of the tournament, including the Plate final on Sunday, Connor has not had the chance to play at “home”, with New Zealand playing at Hagley Oval when in Christchurch.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old Landscape Architecture student chose to study at Lincoln because of his interest in design, and also because of the sports facilities Lincoln has to offer.</p>
<p>Born in Southern Cross in Western Australia, he came to live in Christchurch when he was two.</p>
<p>“I grew my passion for cricket really from just hitting a ball around in the backyard with dad and my mates at school. Playing it with my mates on a Saturday not having to worry about anything else but the game was a thing I loved.</p>
<p>“Some of my goals inside and outside of cricket are to finish my degree but also to keep improving my cricket in the hope that one day I will be able to play for Canterbury and maybe even for New Zealand at the highest level.</p>
<p>“I would also love to travel the world with my degree and experience what overseas has to offer.”</p>
