<p><em>This is my blood oath with myself: the only</em><br><em>dead Chinese person I’ll write about from now on</em><br><em>is me.</em></p>
<p>In <em>How to be Dead in a Year of Snakes</em>, Chris Tse took readers back to a shocking murder in 1905. Now he brings the reader much closer to home_. He’s so MASC_ confronts a contemporary world of self-loathing poets and compulsive liars, of youth and sexual identity, and of the author as character – as pop star, actor, hitman, and much more. These are poems that delve into worlds of hyper-masculine romanticism and dancing alone in night clubs.</p>
<p>With its many modes and influences, <em>He’s so MASC</em> is an acerbic, acid-bright, yet unapologetically sentimental and personal reflection on what it means to perform and dissect identity, as a poet and a person.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Tse</strong> was born and raised in Lower Hutt. He studied English literature and film at Victoria University of Wellington, where he also completed an MA in Creative Writing at the IIML. Tse was one of three poets featured in AUP New Poets 4 (Auckland University Press, 2011) and his work has appeared in publications in New Zealand and overseas. His first collection_, How to be Dead in a Year of Snakes_ (AUP, 2014) won the Jessie Mackay Award for Best First Book of Poetry in 2016**.**</p>
