<p><strong>Pasture and Flock</strong></p>
<p>Anna Jackson</p>
<p>Auckland University Press<br>Paperback, 210 x 135 mm, 148 pages<br>8 MARCH 2018, $34.99<br>Poetry<br><strong>The latest collection of poetry from Anna Jackson is pastoral yet gritty, sweet but with a sting.</strong><br>Uneasy nights out with dead Russian poets, dalliances with German gasfitters and emotionally fraught games of badminton are brought together for the first time, along with a brand new body of work, in this time-spanning selection of Anna Jackson’s poetry. Local gothic, suburban pastoral and answerings-back to literary icons are all enhanced by Jackson’s light hand and sly humour.</p>
<p><em>There are some poets you travel the routes of</em><br><em>so often you could feel your way in the dark,</em><br><em>that turn, that corner, and then the plummet</em><br><em>towards the end. What does it give you, after all,</em><br><em>to meet in person in a room? A thought</em><br><em>the dog doesn’t share, when, having known</em><br><em>the followed route, the stored scent,</em><br><em>an affair of the air, here is</em><br><em>the other dog! Incarnate! Guessed and host!</em><br>‘Poets know words, know routes, know ghosts’</p>
<p>Pastoral yet gritty, intellectual and witty, sweet but with stings in their tails, the poems and sequences collected in <em>Pasture and Flock</em> are essential reading for both long term and new admirers of Jackson’s varied and slanted approach to lyric poetry.</p>
<p><strong>Anna Jackson</strong> made her debut in AUP _New Poets 1_before publishing six collections with Auckland University Press, most recently <em>I, Clodia</em> (2014). She has a DPhil from Oxford and is an associate professor in English literature at Victoria University of Wellington. Jackson is the author of <em>Diary Poetics: Form and Style in Writers’ Diaries 1915–1962</em> (2010) and, with Charles Ferrall, <em>British Juvenile Fiction 1850–1950: The Age of Adolescence</em> (2009).</p>
