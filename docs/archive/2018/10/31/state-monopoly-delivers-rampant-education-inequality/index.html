<p>A government monopoly has created one of the most unequal education systems in the world, according to a new report.</p>
<p>UNICEF’s Innocenti Report Card ranked New Zealand 33 out of 38 countries on educational equality.</p>
<p>“For decades, Labour and National have propped up a monochromatic, one-size-fits-all approach to education that has seen disadvantaged Māori and Pacific students slip through the cracks”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“ACT’s Partnership Schools offered a bright speck of innovation and a way out for kids that were failing in public schools.</p>
<p>“Disadvantaged students that had been failed by the state system were engaged and succeeding under Partnership Schools.</p>
<p>Māori and Pacific students made up about 80 per cent of students at Partnership Schools.</p>
<p>“This latest UNICEF report shows Māori and Pacific students are less likely than other students to leave the education system with a qualification, with only 71 percent of Māori staying at school until 17.</p>
<p>“These results make the Government’s decision to end the Partnership School model inexplicable.</p>
<p>“That decision will be a stain on the record of this Government, especially for those Labour Māori MPs that remained silent.</p>
<p>“ACT will fight to make educational choice a top priority for any future centre-right government.”</p>
