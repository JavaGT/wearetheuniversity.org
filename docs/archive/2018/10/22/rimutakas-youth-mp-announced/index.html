<p><strong>Monday, 22 October 2018, 6:40 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Rimutaka’s Local MP Chris Hipkins is pleased to announce that Christian Dennison MP will represent the electorate at Youth Parliament next year.</p>
<p>Christian Dennison is a year 11 student at Hutt International Boys School.</p>
<p>“I was impressed by the high quality of applications I received and overwhelmed by how passionate young people are to represent their community” Chris Hipkins said.</p>
<p>“My goal as a Youth MP is to voice the real problems of all youth in my area, from those in Naenae, Taita, Stokes Valley, all the way through Upper Hutt.</p>
<p>“I&#39;m passionate about politics because the decisions of politicians yesterday, today and tomorrow will determine mine and my descendant&#39;s life. I don&#39;t want to miss a single chance to have my say,” Christian Dennison said.</p>
<p>“As well as representing Rimutaka at Youth Parliament in July, Christian Dennison will hold the title of Youth MP for Rimutaka from 1 March to 31 August 2019,” Chris Hipkins said.</p>
<p>“During this time, Christian will actively engage with the community to gain an understanding of the ideas and concerns of youth in the area.</p>
<p>“Becoming a Youth MP is also a very rare opportunity for young people to develop their leadership skills,” Chris Hipkins said.</p>
<p>Notes for editors</p>
<p>Every three years, about 140 young New Zealanders experience Parliament as Youth MPs and Youth Press Gallery members. The Youth Parliament programme provides an opportunity for young people to be heard, and for Youth MPs to actively work on topics and issues they are passionate about. Youth MPs, will come to Parliament on 16 and 17 July 2019, where they will learn about the Government decision-making process. This unique opportunity involves stepping into the shoes of an MP for two days while they debate legislation, sit on select committees and ask oral questions of Ministers.</p>
<p>Youth Parliament is organised by the Ministry of Youth Development in collaboration with the Office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Office of the Clerk, the Parliamentary Service and New Zealand’s 120 Members of Parliament.</p>
