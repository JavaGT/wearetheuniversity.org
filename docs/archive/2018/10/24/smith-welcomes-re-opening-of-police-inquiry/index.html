<p>Nick Smith - MP for Nelson</p>
<p>24 October 2018</p>
<p>Nelson MP Nick Smith has welcomed the positive response from police to his request on behalf of the family to re-open the inquiry into the death of Libby McKay.</p>
<p>“The Police and Coroner need to re-open this inquiry because expert analysis obtained by the family has described the explanation from the partner around the circumstances of Libby McKay’s death as ‘untenable’.</p>
<p>“This expert report needs to be reviewed and witnesses re-interviewed to establish what caused the tragic death of this 27 year old woman and to ensure justice is done.”</p>
<p>Libby McKay died at Christchurch Hospital on 14th June 2013 from a serious head injury in the early morning of 9th June 2013.</p>
<p>The explanation from her partner that the injuries were sustained from rolling out of his vehicle while traveling at 60 to 70 kilometres an hour on Halswell Junction Road is disputed by family in that there was no evidence at the location, no soft tissue injuries and no abrasions on her clothing. Her partner refused to attend the Coroner’s hearing.</p>
<p>“I wrote to the Police Commissioner at the start of October seeking to have the inquiry re-opened. The Commissioner of Police has responded saying the matter had been referred with urgency to the District Commander. The Canterbury District Manager of Criminal Investigations said he would review the investigation in its entirety.</p>
<p>“I commend the Police Commissioner on the prompt response, the decision to re-open the inquiry and the commitment to review the investigation in its entirety. I also appreciate the Police’s commitment to work with Libby’s mother Pauline Webby who has independently gone to great lengths to get justice for her daughter.</p>
<p>“Police are not infallible and need to be prepared to have another look at difficult cases when fresh evidence comes to light.</p>
<p>“There are too many inconsistencies in this case for this tragedy to be left unquestioned. I will be continuing to support the family in their endeavour to get answers and justice for Libby McKay.”</p>
<p>ends</p>
