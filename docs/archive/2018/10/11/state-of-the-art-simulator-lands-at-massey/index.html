<p><strong>State-of-the-art simulator lands at Massey’s School of Aviation</strong>  </p>
<p>Massey University&#39;s School of Aviation is the first pilot training facility in New Zealand to install the new-generation Diamond DA-42 simulator. The state-of-the-art machine, which is worth nearly $700,000, will revolutionise aviation training at the school.</p>
<p>&quot;The simulator will give students the opportunity to practice a range of emergencies that can&#39;t be done safely in an aircraft,&quot; says School of Aviation chief executive Ashok Poduval.</p>
<p>He says the simulator also allows students to prepare for the Qantas Future Pilots Program, which provides a pathway to flying for Jetstar New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;It fits perfectly with our strategy for growth, especially with the looming shortage of pilots and increased training requirements,&quot; he says. &quot;The simulator will be a catalyst for addressing that growth.”</p>
<p>The School of Aviation&#39;s chief of standards Paul Kearney describes the flight experience in the Diamond DA-42 as &quot;incredible&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;At times it&#39;s hard to believe you are in a simulator, it&#39;s so realistic in the way it flies,&quot; he says. &quot;That’s because you are using actual aircraft parts – they literally take it out of the mould at the factory and turn it into a simulator.</p>
<p>“The feeling in the controls is exactly like the real aircraft, which is particularly important when you start doing engine failure work.&quot;</p>
<p>The simulator has a 220-degree wraparound screen, which creates a realistic view outside the plane’s windows. The aircraft can be positioned at any airport in the world and the scenery outside will match the location.</p>

<p>The flying conditions can also be changed, including weather conditions like wind and rain, as well as the lighting conditions, including night flights.</p>
<p>“We have Civil Aviation approvals for things I&#39;ve never seen before with a simulator,” Mr Kearney says. “For example, I can examine pilots in this simulator for a circling approach when landing. That&#39;s because the visuals come right round to behind the wing, which is pretty unique for a simulator.”</p>
