<p><strong>Monday, 1 October 2018, 10:32 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>University of Canterbury (UC) students are showing how to actively think about mental health and wellbeing with an amble that’s anything but aimless.</p>
<p>Part treasure hunt, part orienteering mission, the All Right? Amble is a fun, family-friendly walk with a difference.</p>
<p>Part of the Breeze Walking Festival, the health-focused family event has been organised by 23 Bachelor of Health Sciences (BHSc) health education students, led by UC Health Education lecturer Tracy Clelland of the College of Education, Health and Human Development.</p>
<p>Ms Clelland says the focus of the event is to encourage people to stop and take time out.</p>
<p>“It’s all about creating an impact; to take the students’ lessons about the different aspects of wellbeing from the classroom and connect with the community.</p>
<p>“Good wellbeing is essential to good mental health. It’s something that we all have to manage and this is a good chance to reflect on how you can use the five ways of wellbeing to keep your mental health positive.”</p>
<p>Starting at 10.30am on Sunday 7 October, Amble participants of all ages are encouraged to pick up a map from the Botanic Garden Visitors Centre (before 1.45pm) to help them scout out hidden delights.</p>
<p>The walk connects people across five stations, which draw on the five ways of wellbeing; connect, take notice, keep learning, be active, and give.</p>
<p>After ambling over about two kilometres and collecting a stamp at each point, amblers can return their maps for a prize.</p>
<p>One of the All Right? Amble managers, UC student George Haswell says there are lots of new, exciting activities and games for everyone to experience.</p>
<p>“The aim of the Amble this year is for people to try a variety of activities and strategies that they will be able to apply to their daily lives to improve their overall wellbeing,” he says.</p>
<p>“The message we are promoting is that mental health is a resource for everyday life and has a major impact on everyone in society.”</p>
<p>All Right? Amble, 10am – 2pm, Sunday 7 October, start from Christchurch Botanic Gardens Visitor Centre, Hagley Park.</p>
