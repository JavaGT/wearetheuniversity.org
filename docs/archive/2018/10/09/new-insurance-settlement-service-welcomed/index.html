<p>Nicky Wagner - Greater Christchurch Regeneration</p>
<p>9 October 2018</p>
<p>The Government’s latest announcement of a new earthquake insurance settlement service will be welcomed by homeowners as it expands on the Residential Advisory Service set up by the previous National Government, National’s Greater Christchurch Regeneration spokesperson Nicky Wagner says.</p>
<p>“It’s important homeowners have a place where they can discuss their claims, can find support and move towards resolving any disputes.</p>
<p>“The Residential Advisory Service (RAS) was set up in 2013 and links residents with the correct people for their particular issue and ensures those needing help are given detailed specific advice and guidance by independent advisors.</p>
<p>“The Government recognised the good work RAS does and extended its service to June 2019 with additional funding.</p>
<p>“The RAS has been a highly successful service in Christchurch since its establishment – it has assisted thousands of Christchurch residents with their insurance claims after the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes – and the new service will build on the experiences and learnings from the RAS.</p>
<p>“The Greater Christchurch Claims Resolution Service (GCCR) has the expertise and experience of Darren Wright as the new director, who has been in the thick of the post-earthquake environment and is qualified at resolving claim disputes.</p>
<p>“This gives us confidence that homeowners will be provided with a tailored service that will meet most needs.</p>

<p>“RAS will still be a service available to North Cantabrians affected by the Kaikoura Earthquake, and will be incorporated into the new GCCR.</p>
<p>“GCCR will expand on the support and guidance RAS was providing, and continue to help property owners who are having difficulty with insurance or repair challenges.</p>
<p>“Insurance issues can be extremely stressful and confusing, so we want all homeowners who are going through difficult times to have a place where they know they will receive the support and advice they need.”</p>
