<p>Thursday October 18, 2018</p>
<p>The latest Massey University Home Affordability Report shows a 4.4 per cent improvement in national affordability over the most recent quarter due to falling house prices and historically low residential mortgage rates.</p>
<p>The report, which covers the quarter from June to August 2018, also shows a small improvement of 2.1 per cent in affordability over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Report author Associate Professor Graham Squires says house prices continue to be the key driver.</p>
<p>“Across New Zealand, median house prices decreased by 3.4 per cent this quarter. In dollar terms, that means the median house price decreased by $19,500,” he says.</p>
<p>“Interestingly, the country’s most expensive regions – Auckland and Central Otago Lakes – were amongst the regions to show declines in house prices. Auckland’s median house price fell by $14,000 and Central Otago Lakes’ by $20,000 over the quarter.</p>
<p>“However, both these regions were eclipsed by Northland, where prices fell by $24,000, arguably due to spill-over effects from Auckland’s decline.”</p>
<p>As with the previous report, there were varying results across the country over the past quarter. Seven out of 13 regions showed improvements in affordability, led by Northland with a 6.5 per cent improvement.</p>
<p>Nelson/Marlborough experienced the country’s largest drop in affordability over the last quarter, declining by 8.5 per cent.</p>
<p>“Again, this change has been driven by changes in the median house price – in the Nelson/Marlborough region there was an increase of $34,000 over the last quarter,” Dr Squires says.</p>

<p>Over the past year, eight regions have shown improvements in affordability, aided by a significant decrease in residential mortgage rates, Dr Squires says.</p>
<p>“We are currently seeing the lowest ever mortgage rate in the two-year fixed data series, so the ability for homeowners to repay mortgages looks favourable in the short term. Interestingly, lower rates are coinciding with a cooling property market in many regions.”</p>
<p>Despite recent house price decreases, Central Otago Lakes, which includes Queenstown, remains New Zealand’s least affordable region, followed by Auckland.</p>
<p>“However, median house price-to-income ratios are starting to contract, with house prices in Central Otago Lakes moving from 13.7 to 13.2 times annual wages,” Dr Squires says. “At a national level, this ratio has moved from 9.1 to 8.8.</p>
<p>“Of course, this is still significantly higher than the national ratios that were common in the 1990s – when median house prices were around four times annual wages.”</p>
<p>Southland remains the country’s most affordable region, followed by Taranaki.</p>
