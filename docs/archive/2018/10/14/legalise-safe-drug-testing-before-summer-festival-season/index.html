<p><strong>Green Party: Legalise safe drug testing before summer festival season to save lives</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party are calling for common-sense legalisation of festival drug testing before the summer festival season begins.</p>
<p>“Despite decades of a hard-line approach, including harsh penalties, Governments worldwide have failed to stop recreational drugs being taken at festivals”, Green Party sensible drug law reform spokesperson Chlöe Swarbrick said today.</p>
<p>“This has resulted in unnecessary tragedy, with unknown users ingesting unknown substances, at times costing emergency health sector resources, at worst costing lives.</p>
<p>“This past week, <em>University of Otago Student’s Association</em> took a proposal to their Vice-Chancellor to partner with <em>Know Your Stuff</em>, a local safe drug testing initiative, to minimise harm and improve safety during the Re-Orientation period. It was rejected on the grounds that it’s illegal.</p>
<p>“Technically, safe drug testing exists in a legal grey area because of section 12 of the archaic Misuse of Drugs Act 1975.  </p>
<p><em>“Know Your Stuff</em> has been operating in that grey area by providing festival testing for the last three years. They’ve been performing what is essentially a public service by improving safety, and collecting incredibly valuable data showing people are far less inclined to take substances when they turn out to not be what they thought.</p>
<p>“When a dangerous or deadly chemical comes up, <em>Know Your Stuff</em> is currently unable to notify the public because of s 12 of the Act. They’re also unable to effectively let festival-goers know they are on site.</p>

<p>“The Greens are proud that Government Ministers, and our Prime Minister, are speaking of treating drugs as a health issue – that’s a commitment contained in the Green/Labour Confidence and Supply Agreement.</p>
<p>“Walking that talk looks like legalising safe drug testing. We have every opportunity to do this ahead of the summer festival season, before the House rises for the year.</p>
<p>“It is common sense, it is evidence based, and it can save lives.”</p>
