<p>ACT Would Abolish Role of Human Rights Commissioner  </p>
<p>“The announcement of Paul Hunt as Chief Human Rights Commissioner is the latest appointment to an unnecessary, overpaid, taxpayer-funded job,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“Apart from sporadically telling New Zealanders what to think, say, and do, there appears to be little point to the role of the Human Rights Commissioner.</p>
<p>“The Acting Human Rights Commissioner was completely silent during the Massey University-Dr Don Brash debacle, failing to stand up for one of the most basic human rights of all, free speech.</p>
<p>“Whenever I’ve approached the Commission to support my constituents with genuine human rights issues they have been ineffective, and yet they’re always happy to lecture us about human rights.</p>
<p>“The Commission itself only pays lip service to human rights and seems unable to uphold the same standards it asks of other New Zealand organisations after a groping scandal within the Commission caused the resignation of the last Commissioner in May this year.</p>
<p>“The position is a farce and does nothing to improve human rights in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“ACT would get rid of jobs created by politicians with no justifiable existence and would start with the Human Rights Commissioner.”</p>
