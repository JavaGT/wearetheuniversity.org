<p><strong>Wednesday, 3 October 2018, 10:50 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“The Government could provide a decent pay rise for teachers by cutting the first year fees-free tertiary education policy and using it to pay teachers more,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>Today, secondary school teachers have threatened to strike if the government doesn’t improve its pay offer following the first primary schools teachers’ strike in 24 years.</p>
<p>“The Government clearly has its priorities back to front,” says Mr Seymour.</p>
<p>“Despite funnelling $2.8 billion into a policy to break down financial barriers to university education they’ve failed to increase participation at all.</p>
<p>“Only 29% of kids from decile 1-3 schools attained university entrance in 2017 versus 65.7% of kids from decile 8-10 schools.</p>
<p>“Labour have subsidised higher education for kids from well-off families who would have made it to university anyway and widened the gap for kids from lower socio-economic areas who have been failed by state schools and don’t end up able to make it to university.</p>
<p>“The Government spent $275 million on fees-free this year. That money alone could be an extra $5,000 in pay for every teacher up and down this country.</p>
<p>“Last year ACT campaigned on increasing the average teacher salary by $17,700.</p>
<p>“The Government should admit they got it wrong, scrap fees-free, and focus on providing all kids with a great primary and secondary education so they have the choice of a university education.</p>
<p>“They could start by paying hardworking teachers more and make teaching a career choice for graduates.”</p>
