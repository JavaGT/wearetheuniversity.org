<p><strong>Friday, 26 October 2018, 9:02 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>The mounting teacher crisis could be fixed by performance pay, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>The Government is facing a massive teacher shortage and further strikes.</p>
<p>&quot;This is what happens when you have a rigid, centrally-planned wage structure. Wages can’t respond to shortages.</p>
<p>&quot;Performance pay would see good teachers paid more than poor teachers. More and better graduates would be attracted to the profession.</p>
<p>&quot;Every other industry pays its workers based on performance - why are teachers a special case?</p>
<p>&quot;ACT would also slash the unnecessary welfare and bureaucracy in the education system and use the money to help pay teachers’ salaries.</p>
<p>&quot;We would end the failed, middle-class welfare scheme that is Fees Free. Fees Free is a $3 billion transfer of wealth to the well-off which has failed to increase tertiary participation.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT would also cut the number of bureaucrats at the Ministry of Education by half, leaving one official for each school in the country. That would save $108 million and deliver a $2000 - or over 3 per cent - pay rise for the average New Zealand teacher.</p>
<p>&quot;National and Labour&#39;s tired, old ideas have led us to this point and we need a radically different approach. ACT would pay teachers based on merit and slash the unnecessary welfare and bureaucracy in the education system to deliver better results.&quot;</p>
