<p><strong>Tuesday, 24 April 2018, 4:40 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Peace_Action_Wellington">Peace Action Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Peace groups will remember civilians at Anzac day events<br>From: Peace Action Wellington<br>Date: Tuesday, April 24</p>
<p>Peace Action Wellington and friends will join Anzac day events in<br>Wellington to remember civilian casualties of war. We will call for an<br>end to war, and will honour all civilians casualties with a respectful<br>presence at the dawn service at Pukeahu and at the Wellington Citizens’<br>Wreath-laying Service at the Cenotaph at 9am.</p>
<p>“We will be laying a wreath for civilian casualties of war because all<br>loss of life in war is abhorrent.” said spokesperson, Laura Drew. Peace<br>Action Wellington will be laying a wreath alongside other peace groups<br>who will be laying wreaths for conscientious objectors, the Afghan<br>people killed in Operation Burnham, and the people killed by ANZAC<br>soldiers in the Surafend Massacre in Palestine, 1918.</p>
<p>“In the past four years we have seen an increasing obsession with Anzac<br>day. This came to a head around the First World War centenary. Anzacs<br>continue to be heavily romanticised as heroes and the protagonists of<br>the historical New Zealand war narrative. However, selective<br>commemoration can alter our view of history, and whose lives we deem to<br>be important. On this day of remembrance it’s important we remember all<br>aspects of war, including the civilian casualties and those that opposed<br>it.”, said spokesperson, Alex Davies.</p>
<p>“We cannot separate commemorations of the past from the contemporary<br>wars we participate in. Anzac day is a day to remember and reflect, we<br>should be able to think critically and question how as a country we can<br>be actively working towards peace.”, said Drew.</p>

<p>The government has finally begun an inquiry into the SAS lead Operation<br>Burnham in Afghanistan and commemorations of the New Zealand Land Wars,<br>both of which have only happened because citizens have stood up and<br>requested it. Peace Action Wellington hopes that this reflection means<br>we can move forward and actively work towards full demilitarisation.</p>
<p>“When we lay our wreath we will also be remembering the more than<br>100,000 civilians that have died in Syria. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern<br>misspoke when she said that New Zealand ‘accepted’ the bombing of Syria<br>by the US, UK and France. Many New Zealanders would prefer that our<br>country took a stand for peace and led the way on international<br>demilitarisation and non-violent diplomacy.”, Davies said.</p>
<p>During her first foreign policy speech in February this year Ardern said<br>that New Zealand, &quot;Must recommit ourselves to the cause of<br>non-proliferation and disarmament, and to the norms and rules which<br>support those endeavours.&quot; Actions speak louder than words, however.<br>Peace Action Wellington calls on our government to end all New Zealand<br>support and involvement in foreign conflicts including Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“When we say ‘Never again’, we should mean it.”, said Drew.  </p>
