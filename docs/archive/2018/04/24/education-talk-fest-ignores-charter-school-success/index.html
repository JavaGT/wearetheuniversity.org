<p>Education talk-fest ignores charter school success  </p>
<p>“Kelvin Davis’ proposal for an ‘education conversation’ ignores the fact that Maori are making real progress within charter schools”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“The Government is calling for ideas on how to lift Maori educational achievement and engagement.</p>
<p>“Davis could have just asked his Ministry of Education officials. A couple of weeks ago they released an independent report which shows charter schools are doing just that.</p>
<p>“Instead, his Government’s response has been to ignore the evidence, choosing ‘dogma over data’ as Lisa Owen put it on the weekend.</p>
<p>“Davis knows charter schools are working for Maori. That’s why he said he would resign if the charter schools in his electorate were closed.</p>
<p>“The Maori caucus have been missing in action – silenced by a Government doing the bidding of the teachers’ unions.</p>
<p>“The Government’s decision to strip away the opportunities afforded to 1300 students, many of whom are Maori, will do lasting damage to that community”, says Mr Seymour.</p>
