<p><strong>UC PhD student to work on UN Sustainable Development Goals</strong></p>
<p>University of Canterbury doctoral researcher Emily Laing has been selected as a ‘talent’ to take part in UNLEASH, a global program for innovation, hosted in Singapore.</p>
<p>She will attend this year’s UNLEASH Innovation Lab from 30 May - 6 June. It is a forum for young innovators to work on solutions and strive toward UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p>UNLEASH provides Emily with full funding to attend the lab with around 1000 other young talents selected from across the world in a number of different focus areas.</p>
<p>“My focus areas are affordable and clean energy, climate action and sustainable cities and communities,” she says.</p>
<p>“I was encouraged to apply for UNLEASH Lab by my brother who attended last year – he is a doctor setting up rural health centres in Gulu, Uganda. My application was based on my PhD research in Pacific studies and project management that I did here at the University of Canterbury through the Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies (MBC), with assistance from theBusiness School’s Department of Management, Marketing and Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>“It looks into the management of solar energy infrastructure development projects in the Pacific Islands and how these aid-funded projects can be better managed for sustainable development outcomes and stronger community-focused project impacts.</p>

<p>Only a few weeks ago Emily successfully defended her PhD thesis – <em>Project Management of Renewable Energy Development Initiatives in the South Pacific: A Case Study Analysis of the Sustainability Potential of Foreign Aid</em> – and will graduate in April’s graduation ceremonies.</p>
<p>Director of the Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies, Professor Steven Ratuva describes Emily’s award as “a great achievement”.</p>
<p>“Emily’s thesis displayed exceptional analytical skills and intellectual insight. We’re proud she’ll be flying the MBC flag there in Singapore. She has a great future in front of her,” Professor Ratuva says.</p>
