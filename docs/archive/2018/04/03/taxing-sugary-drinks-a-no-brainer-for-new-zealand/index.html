<p><strong>Taxing sugary drinks a no-brainer for New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>On 1 April 2018, the United Kingdom introduced a sugary drinks tax, an important public health measure that University of Otago, Wellington, public health researchers believe should be happening in New Zealand too.</p>
<p>The UK is joining many other countries and numerous jurisdictions that now have some variety of a sugary drinks tax – a tax that has been shown to work and have positive spill-over effects.</p>
<p>“We think there is a role for Government-led action to help address the obesity epidemic”, says Professor Tony Blakely, from the University of Otago, Wellington’s Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>A sweetened sugary beverage (SSB) tax is rapidly gaining traction as a public health measure amongst countries concerned about their growing rates of obesity and diabetes.</p>
<p>Professor Blakely and his team have analysed the literature and recent reports and have recently written a blog about the health impacts this levy might have here in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Sugary drink taxes can be configured in many ways. Professor Blakely says that the UK levy is actually a tiered soft drinks industry levy.</p>
<p>“It is clever, and its impact is much more than via the direct price signal to the consumer.”</p>
<p>A sugary drink tax will have a number of impacts/benefits including:</p>
<p>1. A price signal to the consumer to reduce consumption (makes an impact reduce obesity rates by around 1%, not massive but has an impact<br>2. A price signal to the industry to reformulate (i.e. reduce sugar content to move products down a tier). The health gain from this mechanism is probably twice that of the price signal to the consumer.<br>3. The incentives on industry to change marketing to less sugary drinks.</p>

<p>The researchers also refute a recent New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) report that argues against taxing sugary drinks. “This report, commissioned by the Ministry of Health, has some serious flaws,” says Professor Blakely.</p>
<p>“There have been at least nine good studies including a thoroughly researched Australian Grattan Institute report. Unfortunately the NZIER chose to include only one of the studies,” says Blakely.</p>
<p>Blakely says a soft drinks industry levy is something that could be put in place right now in New Zealand and would not tip the apple cart in light of macro-level rebalancing of our total tax system.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization recommends taxing sugary drinks. And here in New Zealand, the NZ Medical Association and the Heart Foundation recommend taxing sugary drinks.</p>
<p>“The NZ Government would be strongly supported by the scientific evidence if it did opt for a sugary drinks tax, with the UK tiered soft drinks industry levy providing an exemplar to follow.”</p>
