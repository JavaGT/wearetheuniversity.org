<p><strong>Thursday, 12 April 2018, 10:47 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Ending offshore exploration is lose-lose</p>
<p>“The Government’s decision to end offshore oil and gas exploration will put 11,000 jobs at risk and could harm the environment”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“The oil and gas industry creates thousands of jobs, contributes $2.5 billion to the New Zealand economy and $500 million to the Government in royalties each year.</p>
<p>“Not only will this policy make us poorer as a country, it will drive production of oil and gas overseas which will harm the environment.</p>
<p>“Natural gas has about half the emissions of coal, and New Zealand-produced oil has lower emissions than oil produced overseas</p>
<p>“Ending offshore exploration will force New Zealand households and firms to buy higher-cost and dirtier energy from foreign sources.</p>
<p>“This is another example of Jacinda Ardern governing by what sounds good without asking the questions ‘will this policy work’ and ‘what will be the side effects’?</p>
<p>“This is a dangerous and arrogant government that will destroy wealth and opportunity without warning - no sector is safe.</p>
<p>“This is a lose-lose policy and the Government should consider very carefully how it will impact New Zealanders”, says Mr Seymour.</p>
