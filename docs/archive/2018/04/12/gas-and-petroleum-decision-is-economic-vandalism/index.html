<p>Gas and petroleum decision is economic vandalism</p>
<p>The Government’s decision to ban gas and petroleum exploration is economic vandalism that makes no environmental sense, National MPs Jonathan Young and Todd Muller says.</p>
<p>“This decision will ensure the demise of an industry that provides over 8000 high paying jobs and $2.5 billion for the economy,” Energy and Resources Spokesperson Jonathan Young says.</p>
<p>“Without exploration there will be no investment in oil and gas production or the downstream industries. That means significantly fewer jobs.</p>
<p>“This decision is devoid of any rationale. It certainly has nothing to do with climate change. These changes will simply shift production elsewhere in the world, not reduce emissions.</p>
<p>“Gas is used throughout New Zealand to ensure security of electricity supply to every home in New Zealand. Our current reserves will last less than ten years – when they run out we will simply have to burn coal instead, which means twice the emissions.</p>
<p>“The Government says that existing wells will continue but that’s code for winding the sector down.</p>
<p>Climate Change Spokesperson Todd Muller says the decision makes no sense – environmentally or economically – because less gas production means more coal being burnt and higher carbon emissions.</p>
<p>“Many overseas countries depend on coal for energy production. Those CO2 emissions would halve if they could switch to natural gas while they transition to renewable energy.</p>

<p>“By stopping New Zealand’s gas exploration we are turning our backs on an opportunity to help reduce global emissions while providing a major economic return to improve our standard of living and the environment.</p>
<p>“We need to reduce global CO2 emissions. But there is no need to put an entire industry and thousands of New Zealanders’ jobs at risk.”</p>
<p>Mr Young says the Government’s decision today is another blow to regional New Zealand, and Taranaki in particular.</p>
<p>“It comes hot on the heels of big decisions that reduce roading expenditure, cancel irrigation funding, and discourage international investment in the regions.</p>
<p>“This is simply Jacinda Ardern destroying an industry in the cause of a political slogan pushed by Greenpeace.”</p>
