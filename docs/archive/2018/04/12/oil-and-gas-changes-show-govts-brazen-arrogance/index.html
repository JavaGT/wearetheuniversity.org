<p>Oil and gas changes show Govt&#39;s brazen arrogance</p>
<p>“The Government has shown breathtaking arrogance by keeping the oil and gas industry in the dark over changes to the sector”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>&quot;Fronting media today, it was abundantly clear that the Government hadn’t consulted the industry on the changes.</p>
<p>“The Government has set up about 40 reviews, working groups, or panels, and yet it appears unwilling to consult those who disagree with them on policy.</p>
<p>“This is an emerging theme with the Government.</p>
<p>&quot;Food executives came away shocked at Ministers’ behaviour after David Clark and Damien O’Connor threatened them with a sugar tax if they didn’t voluntarily reduce the level of sugar in their food.</p>
<p>&quot;David Parker’s colleagues are concerned he has neglected consultation with iwi on charging a royalty on bottled water exports.</p>
<p>&quot;Speaking about a water tax during the election campaign, Parker told farmers ‘I’m not here to negotiate. Don’t push me or it will be two cents instead of one cent.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;Chris Hipkins hasn’t even bothered to speak to charter school operators or students since he became a Minister and is pushing ahead with plans to close the schools.</p>
<p>&quot;The brazen arrogance with which this Government is operating lays bare the contempt they hold for those who disagree with them&quot;, says Mr Seymour.</p>
