<p>Govt in spin mode on education funding</p>
<p>The Government needs to stop complaining and start getting on with its job, National’s Education Spokesperson Nikki Kaye says.</p>
<p>“Labour inherited a strong economy from the previous National Government, but it over promised during the election campaign and now it’s learning that its budget is too tight.</p>
<p>“In order to manage expectations about the meagre Budget the Government is about to deliver, it appears Education Minister Chris Hipkins is trying to rewrite history.</p>
<p>“But the fact is, under National the education budget increased every year we were in office and the overall education budget went from $8 billion to over $11 billion.</p>
<p>“When we came into government, we inherited a property portfolio with an average age of 40 years. There was no complete picture of the state of school property.</p>
<p>“We invested more than $5 billion in school property alone – the largest ever. This included more than 30 big projects including the $1.1 billion Christchurch schools rebuild, the $79 million Western Springs College rebuild and the $22 million upgrade for The Gardens School.</p>
<p>“The Auditor-General last year stated that during the time National was in government, the management of the school property portfolio strengthened significantly.</p>
<p>“But we knew there was still more work to be done. That’s why a further $4.85 billion had been set aside over four years for education infrastructure, like school property.</p>

<p>“We were also investing in high-growth areas. Once Budget 2017 is taken into account, we were on track to deliver around 21,000 extra student places needed in Auckland by 2027.</p>
<p>“Mr Hipkins should release evidence to back up his claim of $200 million worth of unusable buildings. If he is suggesting school buildings are unsafe, there are potential legal consequences under health and safety laws.</p>
<p>“This is a government in spin mode. It allocated almost all its money to the fees free bribe, and none to the business-as-usual expenditure that always comes up in education. It just needs to get on with the job.”</p>
