<p>New research shows strong public support for more Government spending on public education, including a significant pay rise for teachers and more support for children with additional learning needs.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa and PPTA commissioned the survey* and NZEI President Lynda Stuart said the findings were a strong indicator of public opinion leading into the May Budget and teacher and principal collective agreement negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has made all the right noises about addressing this crisis and this research shows they have the public mandate to take action,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>PPTA President Jack Boyle was not surprised to hear that New Zealanders understood the issues facing teachers and the teaching profession.</p>
<p>&quot;Unprecedented teacher shortages are caused by extreme workloads, excessive red-tape and salaries that are just plain too low,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Other key findings of the research were:<br>• 83% believe that teachers need a pay rise and of those, 91% of respondents support at least a &quot;moderate&quot; pay increase - 67% want at least a 10% pay rise for teachers and 29% want more than 20%<br>• Most (82%) agree that a pay rise will improve teacher numbers and address shortages<br>• Widespread agreement that there is a shortage of teachers, both at Primary and Secondary schools (85%)<br>• Very strong agreement (91%) that more support is needed for students with additional learning needs<br>Mr Boyle said New Zealanders are starting to see how badly the previous government short-changed every part of society, from our hospitals to our classrooms.</p>
<p>Ms Stuart said bold action was needed to ensure that there was a teacher in every classroom in the future and this survey showed that the public wants action from the government.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re already seeing schools struggle to recruit and retain teachers because even a passion for teaching often can&#39;t compete against the heavy workload, long hours and low pay,&quot; she said.</p>
