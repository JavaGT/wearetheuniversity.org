<p>6 months, 6 destructive policies</p>
<p>Today marks 6 months in office for the Ardern-Peters Government. It has relentlessly pursued ideas that sounded good on the hustings but which will end up hurting New Zealanders. Here are six of their worst policies.</p>
<p><strong>Closing charter schools</strong></p>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17641&qid=5311128">The evidence</a> now shows charter schools are improving engagement, innovation, and achievement for 1500 mainly Maori and Pasifika students. The Government plans to strip away educational opportunities so they can keep a promise to their union mates.</p>
<p><strong>Ending oil and gas exploration</strong></p>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17642&qid=5311128">As revealed by ACT</a>, the Government has ended offshore oil and gas exploration without a cost-benefit analysis, consultation, or estimates of whether emissions will fall as a result. This policy will gut an industry that pays $500 million in royalties and taxes and employs 11,000 workers at peak times.</p>
<p><strong>Raising the minimum wage</strong></p>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17644&qid=5311128">Officials have told the Government</a> that raising the minimum wage would destroy 3,000 jobs. They will be lost to exactly the people whose best hope of upskilling was a foot on the employment ladder. The Government would rather young, unskilled workers sat at home on a benefit. The job losses will be even greater as the minimum wage is raised to $20 by 2021.</p>

<p><strong>90-day trials</strong></p>
<p>&quot;ACT’s policy of a 90-day trial has given thousands a start in the labour market when employers mightn’t have otherwise taken a chance on them. As if hiking the minimum wage didn’t destroy enough opportunity, this policy will make hiring staff more risky, leading to fewer jobs overall.</p>
<p><strong>Fees-free</strong></p>
<p>“A $275 million subsidy for generally well-off kids who would have gone to university anyway and who will earn much more over their lives than non-graduates. ACT revealed last month that the first-year drop-out rate of 14 per cent will mean New Zealanders can except <a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17643&qid=5311128">$38 million of their taxes to deliver exactly nothing</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Foreign buyer ban</strong></p>
<p>“An unworkable disaster of a bill. There’s no evidence house prices will fall as a result of this ban. The bill will restrict new construction by making foreign-owned construction companies jump through regulatory hoops. As Eric Crampton has pointed out, the bill doesn&#39;t just target overseas speculators - a British doctor moving to Greymouth on a work visa would not be able to buy a house. The bill further harms our reputation as a place to do business.&quot;  </p>
