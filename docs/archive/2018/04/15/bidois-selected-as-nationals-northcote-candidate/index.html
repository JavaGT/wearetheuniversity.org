<p><strong>Sunday, 15 April 2018, 4:19 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Bidois selected as National’s Northcote candidate</strong>  </p>
<p>Dan Bidois has been selected by local party members as National’s candidate to fight the Northcote by-election.</p>
<p>Mr Bidois is currently Strategy Manager for Foodstuffs. He was raised and educated in Auckland, leaving school at 15 to complete a butchery apprenticeship with Woolworth’s New Zealand.</p>
<p>Aspirational for his future, he went on to study at the University of Auckland, and attended Harvard University on a Fulbright Scholarship. He has worked as a strategist and economist in New Zealand, the United States, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>“It’s a true honour to be selected as National’s candidate in Northcote,” Mr Bidois says.</p>
<p>“I’m incredibly proud to have the chance to take up the fight for Northcote residents and represent them in Parliament.</p>
<p>“Northcote residents work hard and pay their fair share of rates and taxes. They expect their fair share of quality services in return - like un-congested roads and better public transport options - and they deserve a Council and Government that can manage their finances to provide these services without constant rates and tax increases.</p>
<p>“The hard-working people of Northcote are not a Piggy Bank for Phil Goff, Jacinda Ardern and Winston Peters to raid to pay for pet projects on the other side of the Bridge that won’t benefit us here.</p>
<p>“I’m asking for your support because you deserve better, and I want to be part of a National team in Wellington that will stand up to those in power to address the issues facing Northcote.</p>
<p>“My message to Northcote voters is simple: I am in this race for you, to fight to get this electorate moving and the services you deserve.</p>
<p>“With a strong MP like me in your corner, we can and will get results.”  </p>
