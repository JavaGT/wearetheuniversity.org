<p>Hipkins must reverse charters decision after glowing report</p>
<p>“The Education Minister must now reverse his decision to close Partnership Schools after the <a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17570&qid=5245050">final report</a> from independent consultants Martin Jenkins painted a glowing picture of the model”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“The report cuts through the spin on Partnership Schools, delivering blow after blow to Government’s hopes it could kill off the model quietly.</p>
<p>“The final report shows Partnership Schools are strongly focused on disadvantaged kids with complex needs. Students are largely Maori and Pasifika from low-decile schools. Before attending the Partnership Schools, many students were transient, disengaged, with poor academic histories and complex socio-economic needs. They often lacked positive aspirations and role models.</p>
<p>“The schools are meeting learners’ needs using innovative practices and high-quality standards. Sponsors are driven by a vision to provide an alternative for students who have been underserved. Innovations enabled by the flexible funding model are across the board, in governance arrangements, staffing, student engagement and support, pedagogy, teaching and learning.</p>
<p>“Student engagement has significantly improved. Stand-downs and length of suspensions are lower. Students give positive feedback. Whanau feel more involved and more confident communicating with schools. Very few learners are opting out.</p>
<p>“It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most positive news our education system has had for some time.</p>
<p>“It simply beggars belief that Jacinda Ardern and Chris Hipkins would end an educational model that has delivered so much for students that have been so poorly served by our state system</p>
<p>&quot;The Government must now reverse its position on Partnership Schools”, says Mr Seymour.</p>
