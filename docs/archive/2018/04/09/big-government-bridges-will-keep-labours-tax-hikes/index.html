<p>Big government Bridges will keep Labour’s tax hikes</p>
<p>“Simon Bridges has confirmed his commitment to higher taxes by this morning refusing to roll back proposed fuel tax increases of between 9 and 12 cents a litre”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“This complements his record as a big spending Economic Development Minister.</p>
<p>“When Amy Adams slammed Labour’s ‘tax and spend’ policies the other day, she could have easily been talking about her own leader.</p>
<p>“The National Party under Simon Bridges believes it can return to Government by presenting itself as a more competent version of Labour.</p>
<p>“It has completely lost track of what it stands for.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes you wonder what other socialist policies National will accept when it returns to Government. Will National repeal Labour&#39;s fees-free policy? Will it reinstate the tax cuts that were promised in 2017? Or will it put them in the too hard basket as it did with interest-free student loans and Working for Families, which John Key called &#39;communism by stealth&#39;?</p>
<p>“Only a strong ACT Party will persuade National to cut taxes, wasteful spending, and red tape, and reform the Resource Management Act and Superannuation”, says Mr Seymour.</p>
