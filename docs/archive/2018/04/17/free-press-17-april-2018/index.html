<p>ACT’s regular bulletin  </p>
<p><strong>Another Jacinda Surprise</strong></p>
<p>Last week, the Government decided to kneecap one of our most important industries, putting New Zealanders’ wellbeing at risk for what is essentially a photo op.</p>
<p><strong>Hurting the economy...</strong></p>
<p>The Government’s decision to end offshore oil and gas exploration will put thousands of jobs at risk.</p>
<p>The oil and gas industry contributes $2.5 billion to the New Zealand economy and $500 million to the Government in royalties each year.</p>
<p><strong>… and the environment</strong></p>
<p>It will also drive production of oil and gas overseas, harming the environment.</p>
<p>Natural gas has about half the emissions of coal, and New Zealand-produced oil has lower emissions than oil produced overseas.</p>
<p>New Zealand households and firms will be forced to buy higher-cost and dirtier energy from foreign sources.</p>
<p><strong>Make policy first, ask questions later</strong></p>
<p>This is another example of Jacinda Ardern governing by what sounds good without asking the questions ‘will this policy work’ and ‘what will be the side effects’?</p>
<p><strong>Arrogant government</strong></p>
<p>The Government didn’t have the guts to go to Taranaki to tell locals. It didn’t even consult the industry before the announcement.</p>
<p>Instead, Jacinda went to Victoria to make the announcement in front of hundreds of fawning left-wing students.</p>
<p><strong>Contemptuous of opponents</strong></p>
<p>The Government doesn&#39;t like talking to its opponents.</p>

<p>David Clark and Damien O’Connor have threatened food executives with a sugar tax.</p>
<p>Speaking about a water tax, David Parker told farmers ‘I’m not here to negotiate. Don’t push me or it will be two cents instead of one cent.’</p>
<p>Chris Hipkins hasn’t even bothered to speak to charter schools and is pushing ahead with plans to close them.</p>
<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>
<p>Ardern made the announcement before stepping out on to the world stage with the likes of Justin Trudeau.</p>
<p>But Ardern may not find support from Trudeau.</p>
<p>Today he expressed strong support for a project which would triple the capacity of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, saying people’s livelihoods depend on it.</p>
<p><strong>Big Government Bridges won’t reverse socialist policies</strong></p>
<p>Back on the domestic front, Simon Bridges won’t commit to rolling back the Government’s socialist policies.</p>
<p>If he did commit to scrapping fees-free, the Provincial Growth Fund, and raising the age of superannuation eligibility, ACT would deliver meaningful tax cuts with a top tax rate of 25 per cent.</p>
<p><strong>Campaigning from the right, governing from the left</strong></p>
<p>Instead, it appears National will continue its tendency to campaign from the right, and govern from the left.</p>
<p>It is committed to limited government in opposition, but lacks the fortitude to reverse socialist policies when they get the chance.</p>
<p>ACT is committed to reversing Labour’s tax and spend policies as part of the next centre-right government.</p>
<p><strong>Marama Davidson</strong></p>
<p>The Greens have elected a committed Marxist as their new female co-leader Marama Davidson.</p>
<p>Her comments on social media show she has a particular distaste for free markets.</p>
<p>She also seems to wants to kick rich people out of politics - certainly not the inclusive brand of politics the Greens have promised.</p>
<p><strong>No ‘Teal Deal’</strong></p>
<p>Davidson&#39;s overwhelming victory shows that the Greens are now controlled by their fundamentalist, social activist base.</p>
<p>It is certainly a far cry from the environmentalism of Jeanette Fitzsimons and Rod Donald.</p>
<p>The so-called ‘Teal Deal’ with National is dead.</p>
<p>In order to form the next government, the centre-right needs a strong ACT.</p>
<p>ends</p>
