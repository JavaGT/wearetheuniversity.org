<p><strong>Saturday, 28 April 2018, 11:37 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT Leader David Seymour has asked Jacinda Ardern to accept a petition from charter school students which urges her Government not to close their schools. 3000 New Zealanders have signed the petition at <a href="http://www.savecharters.kiwi">www.savecharters.kiwi</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;I invited the Prime Minister to name a date on which she would receive the petition at her electorate office in Auckland, but it appears she is unwilling to face up to the kids whose schools she is shutting down”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>&quot;Jacinda Ardern has often said that her Government will put children at the heart of everything and that she is willing to meet with those who disagree with her.</p>
<p>“Despite her flowery rhetoric on the campaign trail, the Prime Minister now seems to be ducking and diving for cover.</p>
<p>“Has she realised that a majority of New Zealanders support charter schools staying open and disapprove of her Government’s handling of the issue?</p>
<p>“She was willing to appear for a photo op and to accept a petition from Greenpeace, but doesn&#39;t want to meet with the children whose schools she is shutting down.</p>
<p>“The very least the Prime Minister can do is to face up to these kids and accept their petition”, says Mr Seymour.</p>
