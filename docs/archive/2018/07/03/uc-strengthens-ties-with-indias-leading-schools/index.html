<p>UC strengthens ties with India’s leading international schools</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury has signed memoranda of understanding (MOU) with three of India’s leading international high schools.</p>
<p>Last month, UC hosted the three principals from premier boarding school SelaQui International School (Dehardun), National Public School (Bangalore) and India International School (Bangalore). The Indian school delegates also met with Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel, discussing key matters including student safety, international student value and post-study opportunities in Christchurch.</p>
<p>The MOU scope includes educational pathways programmes and student exchanges, tailored advice and workshops, and marketing campaigns targeted at penultimate and final-year high school students.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says UC’s direct partnership with the three schools increases the value of each among India’s highly competitive education market.</p>
<p>“By establishing these relationships, UC has raised the profile of New Zealand and UC as a prominent alternative study destination,” Dr Carr says.</p>
<p>“UC can trust the partnerships to nurture the flow of premier international students who can provide new perspectives on campus.”</p>
<p>SelaQui International School Director Hina Sharif describes the MOU as a significant step forward in strengthening the ties with the University.</p>
<p>“This initiative responds to the growing interest of SelaQui students in UC. I am certain that this MOU will mark the beginning of new era. We earnestly hope that it will be a long and fruitful association and SelaQui students will be warmly welcomed into the vibrant and engaging community of the University of Canterbury,” she says.</p>

<p>UC’s Director of International Growth Strategies, Dr Ian MacDonald says the formal collaboration is a pioneering step within the Indian market and will give UC a strategic edge in attracting high quality undergraduate students.</p>
<p>“Currently, India is one of the key growth markets for UC in terms of student recruitment, with further growth projected as a result of the new MOUs,” Dr MacDonald says.</p>
<p>The University has established strong relationships with the schools through regular delegations to India, which included UC College of Engineering Director of Studies (International) senior lecturer and Dr Moffat Mathews, who helped foster Indian school ties through staff and student advice and interactive workshops.</p>
