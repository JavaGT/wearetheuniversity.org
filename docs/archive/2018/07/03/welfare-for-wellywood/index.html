<p><strong>Tuesday, 3 July 2018, 9:48 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>This last weekend Matt Nippert at the Herald <a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17942&qid=5541487">lifted the lid</a> on just how powerful Wellywood is when it comes to extracting concessions from New Zealand taxpayers.</p>
<p>Kiwis have paid out $600m in corporate welfare to international film and television producers since 2010 for minimal gain.</p>
<p>It&#39;s unacceptable that a young couple saving for a mortgage are paying tax so that Scarlett Johansson can take home a bigger pay cheque and the film industry can line its pockets.</p>
<p><strong>Cut corporate welfare, return the money</strong></p>
<p>We should end corporate welfare for Wellywood.</p>
<p>Our film subsidy scheme has become a race to the bottom as countries compete with increasingly large handouts to attract film production.</p>
<p>Every dollar spent on film subsidies is a dollar that can&#39;t be spent elsewhere.</p>
<p>Who really believes politicians are excel at investing our taxes? Individuals and businesses know better how to spend their own money.</p>
<p><strong>Winter energy payments</strong></p>
<p>New Zealanders will pay about <a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17943&qid=5541487">$73 million</a> for the winter power bills of well-off pensioners.</p>
<p>Untargeted ‘winter energy payments’ epitomise a Government that taxes and spends without reflecting on its objectives.</p>
<p>It is irresponsible to give welfare to people that don’t need it.</p>

<p>There is no way we can cut taxes, and boost the economy, when political parties of all stripes are addicted to giving away handouts.</p>
<p>Kiwis should be allowed to keep what they’ve earned.</p>
<p><strong>Would a National Government reverse the Families Package?</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday on Radio New Zealand <a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17944&qid=5541487">Simon Bridges couldn’t say</a> what National would change about the package.</p>
<p>Bridges was also asked whether he’d scrap the expensive failure fees-free and said: &quot;We’re working through what we think about it”.</p>
<p>Centre-right voters want a clear alternative to this tax and spend Labour Government.</p>
<p>Only ACT is committed to reversing the Government’s big spending policies and returning money to its rightful owners.</p>
<p><strong>Regional fuel tax kicks in</strong></p>
<p>The poorest Aucklanders will be in <a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17945&qid=5541487">hit hardest</a> by Phil Twyford’s new regional fuel tax.</p>
<p>They tend to live further from the city centre and so use more fuel during their commute. They are less likely to be able to access electric and newer fuel efficient vehicles. Lastly, increased fuel costs will put upward pressure on the prices of everyday goods and services.</p>
<p><strong>Will it go nationwide?</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17946&qid=5541487">ACT has revealed</a>, councils are lining up for the power to implement regional fuel taxes of their own.</p>
<p><a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17925&qid=">At least 14 councils</a> have discussed a regional fuel tax.</p>
<p>Phil Twyford has set out to solve a problem in Auckland, and now ratepayers across the country are going feel the burden of another tax.</p>
<p>ACT says central government should share the GST from new construction with local government so councils can build infrastructure without a new tax.</p>
<p><strong>Curtis on Partnership Schools</strong></p>
<p>Sir Toby Curtis of the Iwi Leaders Forum has written a <a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17947&qid=5541487">powerful piece</a>in the Herald on the Government’s decision to close Partnership Schools.</p>
<p>He says the Government has refused to meet with him face to face and has made its decision before hearing submitters to the select committee and without visiting the schools.</p>
<p>He rightly points out that the state system has failed Maori and Pasifika. Partnership Schools are being run by Māori for Māori, and by Pasifika for Pasifika.They are engaging students for the first time in their lives and empowering families and whanau.</p>
<p>Most of the schools are performing well above national averages.</p>
<p>Sir Toby finishes with these lines: “My plea to the minister is to stop this injustice…And stop the cold-hearted removal of a model that is giving 1300 young New Zealanders…a better chance at life.”</p>
