<p><strong>Wednesday, 18 July 2018, 3:46 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>New Zealand First Celebrates 25 Years</strong></p>
<p>“New Zealand First is proud to celebrate it’s 25 year anniversary today,” says New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“No other new party can claim our record of electoral success. We are now the third longest running party in New Zealand’s democratic history. We’ve seen political parties formed in recent times, backed by millions of dollars and big ideas, that have collapsed without the support of everyday New Zealanders.”</p>
<p>New Zealand First was formed on 18 July 1993 at Alexandra Park, Auckland following Mr Peter’s resignation from the National Party and subsequent re-election as an independent at the Tauranga By-election.</p>
<p>“We have a serious record of policy achievement and have been part of three Governments in various arrangements. New Zealand First remains a party that will put the needs of all New Zealanders at the forefront of policy and Government decision making,” says Mr Peters.</p>
<p>“I would like to thank the tens of thousands of members and supporters who have contributed to our success, and helped us overcome the very real adversity we’ve faced.”</p>
