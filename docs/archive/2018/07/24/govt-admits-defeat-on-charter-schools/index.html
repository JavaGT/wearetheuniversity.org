<p><strong>Tuesday, 24 July 2018, 3:44 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>The Government today has admitted defeat on charter schools by allowing six to remain open, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>&quot;However, there is still uncertainty over one school thanks to ministerial incompetence.</p>
<p>&quot;Chris Hipkins has finally come to the realisation that the schools are lifting engagement and achievement for about 1500 students.</p>
<p>&quot;Charter schools are a popular ACT idea - 57 per cent of New Zealanders believe they should stay open.</p>
<p>&quot;An independent MartinJenkins report showed the schools are strongly focused on disadvantaged kids with complex needs - largely Maori and Pasifika from low-decile schools.</p>
<p>&quot;They are driven by a vision to provide an alternative for students who have been underserved by state schools.</p>
<p>&quot;It is no exaggeration to say they are the most positive development in our education system for some time.</p>
<p>&quot;There should no doubt whatsoever: if ACT forms part of the next Government it will fight to open more charter schools, providing choice for parents and students underserved by the state system.</p>
