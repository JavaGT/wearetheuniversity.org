<p>VUWSA backs the ‘Plan to Fix Renting’, says tertiary students are vulnerable under current system</p>
<p>The Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) supports the 36-point “Plan to Fix Renting” announced by Renters United on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“It’s no secret New Zealanders are suffering under the current rental laws, and tertiary students are particularly vulnerable,” VUWSA President Marlon Drake says.</p>
<p>VUWSA is backing Renters United comprehensive plan, and will focus its energy on a targeted campaign to get a Rental Warrant of Fitness and the licensing of property managers into legislation.</p>
<p>“VUWSA has been campaigning for a Rental WOF for years now, through our Student Friendly Wellington campaign,” Drake says. “Tertiary students, who are often first-time renters, have limited rental options and are often forced to sign agreements for houses that are damp, cold, mouldy and in disrepair.</p>
<p>“The idea that everyone should have a “shitty student flat” experience is outdated and putting people’s health and wellbeing at risk.”</p>
<p>As for property managers, Drake says students are at their mercy.</p>
<p>“There are so many stories of renters being charged exorbitant fees by property managers, but students often lack the confidence and knowledge in rental laws to challenge them,” he says.</p>
<p>Licensing property managers will give tenants confidence that they’re signing valid and legal tenancy agreements and they can report those who are exploiting tenants and know something will be done about it, Drake says.</p>
