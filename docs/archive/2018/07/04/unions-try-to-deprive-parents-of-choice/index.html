<p><strong>Wednesday, 4 July 2018, 8:39 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“Teachers’ unions should stop interfering with charter schools and trying to deprive parents and students of choice”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p><a href="http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17953&qid=5556497">RNZ today reported</a> that NZEI has made several submissions opposing applications for charter schools to re-join the state system as designated character schools.</p>
<p>“How is it the business of teachers’ unions which schools are allowed to remain open?</p>
<p>“Would we let bus drivers decide bus routes? Should we allow baristas decide what coffee we need?</p>
<p>“Parents and children should determine which schools are set up and where.</p>
<p>“Teachers’ unions should not have the right to veto the educational offerings parents and children have available to them.</p>
<p>“It shows the unions are deeply afraid different educational models might succeed where the state system has failed”, says Mr Seymour.</p>
