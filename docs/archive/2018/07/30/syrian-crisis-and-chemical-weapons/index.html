<p><strong>International law of war expert discusses Syrian crisis and chemical weapons</strong></p>
<p>International law of war expert Professor Tim McCormack will discuss the use of chemical weapons in Syria in a public talk at the University of Canterbury this week.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Law Foundation’s 2018 Distinguished Visiting Fellow, international humanitarian law expert Professor McCormack will be giving a public lecture – <em>Chemical Weapons and Other Atrocities: Contrasting Responses to the Syrian Crisis –</em> on Thursday, 2 August, hosted by the UC Law School.</p>
<p><strong>Chemical Weapons and Other Atrocities</strong></p>
<p>“As the Syrian catastrophe lurches into its eighth year, the international community watches recurrent egregious atrocities unfold before our collective eyes,” Professor McCormack says.</p>
<p>“Apart from lethal force deployed against ISIS targets in Syria, the international community has been precluded from undertaking any substantive action against the Assad Regime – except in response to allegations of the use of chemical weapons.”</p>
<p>Professor McCormack will discuss the questions: What is it about chemical weapons that has evoked such outrage and facilitated US-Russian co-operation against Assad? Is it a particularly visceral reaction to the use of chemicals to kill or the manner in which people die? Is it a long-standing taboo against the use of chemicals as weapons of war? Or is there some more cynical explanation that has nothing to do with humanitarian concerns?</p>
