<p>Each job being created through the Government’s Provincial Growth Fund comes with an eye-watering price tag of more than $120,000, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=UvCCd8GcsmKKe6vGMpaWv4E2nPk-lICw22foZBbnBYwes1XOEwFuSVdHh2ZCVTvztGdkinq1e_ddB1aYz8bfLqx3z7Z7SLTENdF_R_bqcDs&e=752ed10e9ed7db3a7867d6b86ebadc6c&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pgf_120_000_a_job&n=2">According to the New Zealand Herald</a>, Shane Jones has spent $400 million from his slush fund for a return of just 3300 jobs.</p>
<p>“Returning one year’s allocation of the PGF – $1 billion – to the private sector would be an effective corporate tax cut of 3 per cent. If given the opportunity, firms would create thousands of additional jobs with the same amount of money.</p>
<p>“Too often, schemes like the PGF ignore the simplest truth in economics: a dollar can only be spent once, and every dollar spent by the PGF is a dollar taken from business.</p>
<p>“The question is not ‘what has been done with this money?’ but ‘has the Government spent the dollar better than the people who earned it could have?’ At $120,000 per job, the answer is surely ‘no’.</p>
<p>“Firms have the incentive to create profitable and sustainable employment, because if they don’t, they go bust.</p>
<p>“Politicians have an incentive to set up short-term, make-work schemes that are designed to last beyond the next election. They might win, but taxpayers lose out.</p>
<p>“Alternatively, the Government could put a person through a university degree for $120,000 and set them up for life.</p>

<p>“But this neglects the real purpose of the PGF and other corporate welfare: to generate photo opportunities and votes. Simply allowing firms to keep their own money and create jobs themselves doesn’t cut the political mustard.</p>
<p>“Politicians must be seen to be handing over novelty-sized cheques and creating jobs themselves. What is unseen are the jobs the private sector never creates because they aren’t given the opportunity.”</p>
