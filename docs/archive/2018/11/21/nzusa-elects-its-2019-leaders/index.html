<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>21 November 2018</p>
<p><strong>NZUSA elects its 2019 leaders</strong></p>

<p>The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) has elected the student representatives who will lead the movement in 2019. James Ranstead was elected to serve as National President, with Caitlin Barlow-Groome elected to serve as Vice President. The elections took place at the NZUSA Congress (Annual General Meeting) over the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;I am looking forward to advocating on behalf of New Zealand students in 2019, and my presidency alongside Caitlin is shaping up to be something special. The knowledge gained and experiences had whilst visiting a variety of student unions in Europe in recent months will not only put me in great stead for 2019, but also highlighted how effective and respected NZUSA is within the tertiary education sector and beyond,” says James.</p>
<p>James, 22, is a Bachelor of Science graduate from Lincoln University. He is currently the President of the Lincoln University Students’ Association (LUSA). He has also recently been awarded a 2019 Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford University.</p>
<p>&quot;I am incredibly excited for what NZUSA will achieve for students from all walks of life over the next year. It will be awesome having two student representatives from the South Island for a change!&quot; says Caitlin.</p>

<p>Cailtin, 22, is a Bachelor of Commerce graduate from the University of Otago. She currently serves as President of the Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA).</p>
<p>James says his focus next year will be on student wellbeing and a stronger student voice.</p>
<p>“My two key policies address the fact that there is a mental health crisis facing the youth of Aotearoa New Zealand and that student voice has been stifled since the Voluntary Student Membership Bill was passed in 2011,” says James.</p>
<p>“With the Coalition Government currently making bold steps in the tertiary education space, including the potential mergers of various institutions and the fees-free policy now one year matured, there is a clear need for the student lens to be applied.”</p>
<p>“These are but a sample of the barriers that students face, and I am a strong believer that by removing many of these barriers, tertiary education can help to reduce the huge levels of inequality in New Zealand. Each of our members are playing their part in this.”</p>
<p>The President and Vice President positions are both fulltime and based in Wellington. All officers begin their terms on 1 January 2019.</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national voice of students in tertiary education. We are proudly owned by university and polytechnic student organisations from across Aotearoa.</p>
