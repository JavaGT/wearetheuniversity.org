<p><strong>Massey University has announced the finalists in the Ngā Kupu Ora Māori Journalist of the Year Awards. The University set up the awards in 2016 to highlight the importance of Māori journalism to the national discourse and the revitalisation of te reo Māori.</strong></p>
<p>Organiser Raewyn Rasch says the awards attracted record numbers this year but one of the most pleasing aspects was the large jump in te reo Māori entries which this year outnumbered the English category.</p>
<p><strong>Finalists in the Te Reo Māori category are:</strong></p>
<p>Te Okiwa Mclean - Te Karere</p>
<p>For his inspiring story of a once homeless man graduating from AUT</p>
<p>Irena Smith- Te Karere</p>
<p>For the breaking story confirming the return of the remains of New Zealand service personnel from Malaysia and Singapore.</p>
<p>Rapaera Tawhai -Te Karere</p>
<p>For his feature story on the contest for the Waiariki seat in the 2017 General Election.</p>
<p><strong>Finalists in the English category are:</strong></p>
<p>Oriini Kaipara - Native Affairs</p>
<p>For her exclusive story on a girl stopped from attending her kura kaupapa by order of the Family Court.</p>
<p>Iulia Leilua - Native Affairs</p>
<p>For her investigation into the treatment of children in state care.</p>
<p>Kereama Wright- Marae</p>
<p>For his investigation into the issue of paedophiles who still hold sway on the paepae.</p>
<p>The category winners and winner of the overall Māori Journalist of the Year Award will be announced at an awards lunch to be held at Massey University’s Auckland campus on December 7. The lunch will also be an opportunity to announce the winner of the lifetime achievement award, Te Tohu a Tanara Whairiri Kitawhiti Ngata, named in honour of pioneering Māori journalist, Whai Ngata.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the awards the University will host the bi-annual National Māori Journalism Hui. The hui is a unique opportunity for Māori journalists, media industry and educational institutes to come together to discuss the pressing issues facing Māori journalism.</p>
