<p>Retirement of Adrienne Cleland
After close to 20 years with the University, DVC Operations and Registrar, Adrienne Cleland, has announced her retirement. Adrienne will be with us until later in the year when it is expected a replacement will have been appointed. We will have an opportunity to celebrate Adrienne’s significant contribution to the University later in the year.</p>
<p>Changes to the University logo
This week the University launches its refreshed logo. The new design brings together our traditional crest and our English and te reo Māori names into a simplified and contemporary design style. The launch follows extensive engagement with a wide range of our communities, including students, staff, alumni and mana whenua. Read more about the rationale and rollout of the revised logo, and its application, on the project page<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/intranet/stay-informed/improvement-projects-programmes/brand-evolution.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/intranet/stay-informed/improvement-projects-programmes/brand-evolution.html</a>, News pages<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2025/04/15/refreshed-university-logo-unifies-brand.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2025/04/15/refreshed-university-logo-unifies-brand.html</a> and Brand Guidelines<a href="https://styleguide.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/">https://styleguide.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/</a>.</p>
