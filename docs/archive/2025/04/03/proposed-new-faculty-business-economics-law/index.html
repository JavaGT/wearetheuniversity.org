<p>Updated 3 April 2025</p>
<h2>Extraordinary Council meeting cancelled</h2>
<p>The Extraordinary Council meeting that was set for Monday 7 April 2025 at 10am has been cancelled. </p>
<p>This offers more time to consider all options for the proposed new faculty arrangements for Business and Economics, and Law.</p>
<p>A new date will be shared as required.  </p>
<h2>Key reasons for change</h2>
<p>The revised proposal aims to respond to a rapidly evolving higher education landscape and position the new faculty to respond effectively to technological advancements, workforce changes, and evolving government priorities.</p>
<p>If approved, it would expand research opportunities, grow the postgraduate portfolio, and equip graduates with skills relevant to emerging industries. A more integrated leadership structure would provide the strategic capacity needed to navigate change and drive long-term success.  </p>
<h2>Staff and stakeholder feedback</h2>
<p>The University received 793 submissions on the proposed combination of the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Business and Economics, demonstrating strong engagement from staff and stakeholders. Much of the feedback focused on the Law School’s role within the University and the broader legal community and the importance of reputation, providing valuable insights that have helped refine the proposal.</p>
<p>The Vice-Chancellor received the Review Committee’s recommendations and was inclined to accept them, subject to Senate advice on 3 March and University Council review on 17 March 2025.</p>
<h2>Proposed refinements based on feedback</h2>
<p>If the proposal is approved, several key refinements will be incorporated.</p>
<h3>Extended implementation timeline</h3>
<p>The transition period would be extended, with the faculty launch proposed for 1 January 2026, allowing for a well-managed transition. Key leadership appointments and planning would proceed earlier.</p>
<h3>Law departmental structure retained</h3>
<p>The Auckland Law School would not be split into public and private law departments. Instead, a working group would explore ways to streamline administration and enhance partnerships with Commercial Law.</p>
<h3>Curricula and qualifications remain independent</h3>
<p>The proposal ensures that both the Auckland Law School and Business School would maintain autonomy over their academic programmes while fostering collaboration where beneficial.</p>
<h3>New governance structures</h3>
<p>A working group would be established to develop governance arrangements that support strong representation and effective decision-making across both disciplines.</p>
<h3>Separate board of studies for Law</h3>
<p>A dedicated board of studies would ensure that legal education remains comprehensive and distinct.</p>
<h3>Commitment to Law’s identity</h3>
<p>The Auckland Law School would maintain its unique identity while also benefiting from operational efficiencies and shared opportunities. A clear communication strategy would address concerns about curricular independence, academic mission, and ethical responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>These refinements are subject to advice from Senate and approval by Council.  </p>
