<p>Kia ora tātou,</p>
<p>Last week, the government announced a major overhaul of the science sector.
These reforms stem from the first report of the Science System Advisory Group
that was also released. The changes have implications for the tertiary sector,
which we are beginning to work through as the details are analysed. Initial
comments are available on the News pages

<p>We also await changes that will likely flow from the yet-to-be revealed
University Advisory Group findings.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, the Prime Minister announced a Cabinet reshuffle with Dr
Shane Reti appointed to a new Universities portfolio while also taking over the
Science, Innovation and Technology portfolio. Simeon Brown now leads his Health
portfolio. While there are challenges for our sector, there are also significant
opportunities. I look forward to working with the Minister to navigate these
complexities and ensure our University continues its excellent work supporting
the country’s development.</p>
<p>United Nations Academic Impact Hub</p>
<p>The University has been appointed Chair for the United Nations Academic Impact
Hub on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. In
this role, the University will lead global and national initiatives to support
inclusive economic development and fair work, including advancing research,
fostering collaborations, and enhancing education to address key challenges
relating to SDG 8. To learn more, read University chairs UN hub for decent work

January. Submissions are currently being reviewed, and the Review Committee will
meet in February to discuss and consider any alternate proposals. A
recommendation document, along with advice from Senate will be presented to
Council for consideration Council in March.</p>
