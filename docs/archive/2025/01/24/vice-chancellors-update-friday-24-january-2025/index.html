<p>Yesterday, the government announced a major overhaul of the science sector. These reforms stem from the first report of the Science System Advisory Group, also released yesterday. The changes have implications for the tertiary sector, which we are beginning to work through as the details are analysed. Initial comments are available on the News pages<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2025/01/23/dawn-freshwater-on-research-science-reforms.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2025/01/23/dawn-freshwater-on-research-science-reforms.html</a>.</p>
<p>We also await changes that will likely flow from the yet-to-be revealed University Advisory Group findings.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, the Prime Minister announced a Cabinet reshuffle with Dr Shane Reti appointed to a new Universities portfolio while also taking over the Science, Innovation and Technology portfolio. Simeon Brown now leads his Health portfolio. While there are challenges for our sector, there are also significant opportunities. I look forward to working with the Minister to navigate these complexities and ensure our University continues its excellent work supporting the country’s development.</p>
