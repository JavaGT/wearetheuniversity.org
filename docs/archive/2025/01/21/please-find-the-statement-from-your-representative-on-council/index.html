The consultation period is now closed.</p><p>This is only a proposal. No decision has been formally made.</p><p>I had met with senior staff at the end of last year to discuss the proposal on an informal basis.</p><p>I am sure there are some strong feelings about this proposal among students and members of the wider university community.</p><p>I am encouraging you now to channel these feelings into the consultation process in good faith if you haven&#39;t already done so.</p><p>Treat your submission as an academic exercise with reason, thought-out responses.</p><p>The attacking senior staff, myself or other university officials is pointless.</p><p>This proposal will be scrutinized by other parts of the university if it gets that far.</p><p>Including scrutiny from our academic board, the Senate, as required by law.</p><p>Finally coming to the board table if it gets to that point in March for the scrutiny of members on council, of which I am a member.</p><p>I make the phrase &quot;if the proposal gets to that point&quot; as management may decide to not proceed with the proposal at any point during the process.</p><p>Such a decision would be based on the advice they may receive from the various groups such as the initial review committee, the Senate and finally my council.</p><p>You can observe the proceedings of the Senate and of council during parts of the meetings which the public has not explored it.</p><p>I encourage you to do this as you can hold me to account at council and other student leaders who are on the Senate.</p><p>The Official Information Act is very much a tool for you to seek further information.</p><p>However to streamline and organize I would suggest you use the FYI website or ask the relevant student associations to make those requests on your behalf.</p><p>Ultimately such requests can be given to you, go allowing the university ample time to respond appropriately.</p><p>I have my own opinions on this proposal as I am like any other human being.</p><p>However I will be keeping those opinions private until this business reaches the council&#39;s agenda in March if it gets that far.</p><p>I want to state unequivocally that I remain open to what might be presented at any council meeting.</p><p>This is because of the legal duties placed on me as a member of the council.</p><p>This does add an element of complexity to issues on which students have strong opinions.</p><p>Rest assured I will be bringing your voice to the table.</p><p>I was very upfront about that complexity when I ran for this office last June.</p><p>I know students will respond that this is a cop out.</p><p>However I am listening.</p><p>I continue to monitor what students are saying online.</p><p>I have been reading public comments made by alumni and other professional groups.</p><p>I have my ear to the ground listening to the critics.</p><p>To my knowledge I am the only student representative on council to give you such a robust update and making myself as accessible as possible.</p><p>I am also happy to hear from students directly about the proposal and you can do that by emailing me or DMing me through Instagram.</p><p>I will also be releasing dates in which you can speak with groups or individuals as part of what I am terming councilor clinics.</p><p>You can speak with me on high level issues council should be informed about.</p><p>This is not limited to the merger proposal.</p><p>I will also provide clear guidelines on what I can do during these sessions.</p><p>It is important to note that any comment you provide to me does not form part of the official consultation that the review committee will consider.</p><p>Please be on mind that if I cannot answer questions about the substance of the proposal due to the legal duties I cited earlier,</p><p>I can explain at a high level how the council functions which might be of some use to you.</p><p>I want to thank other student leaders for their advocacy, especially those within AULSS, AUCSA and AUSA,</p><p>as well as other unofficial groups such as We Are The University.</p><p>The recent Q&amp;A court at all with the Deputy Vice Chancellor of Operations and Director of Academic and Student Services highlights the quality of our other student leaders.</p><p>I commend them for having a respectful conversation and asking tough questions on behalf of students.</p><p>I too will be asking similar questions if the proposal comes to the council.</p><p>You will see more videos from me about how the council works and the duties that I am subject to later in the year.</p><p>I hope you will remain safe during your summer break.</p><p>If you are taking courses through summer school, I wish you well.</p></section><section class="footer"><ul><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></section></body>
