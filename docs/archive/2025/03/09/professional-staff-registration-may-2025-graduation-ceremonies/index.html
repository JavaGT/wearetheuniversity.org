<p>Our ‘Autumn’ Graduation ceremonies will take place on Monday 12th, Tuesday 13th, Wednesday 14th and Thursday 15th of May at Spark Arena and we are seeking your help with the ceremonies.</p>
<p>Below are details of how you can volunteer at these Graduation Ceremonies.</p>
<p>The success of graduation is dependent upon support from staff who assist during each graduation day. We would appreciate your registration as a volunteer to assist with marshalling the graduands.</p>
<p>To indicate your availability to marshal click here<a href="https://www.student.admin.auckland.ac.nz/psp/ps/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/UOA_DEVELOPMENT.UOA_GRAD_WEB_FORM.GBL?PORTALPARAM_PTCNAV=UOA_GRAD_WEB_FORM_GBL&EOPP.SCNode=HRMS&EOPP.SCPortal=EMPLOYEE&EOPP.SCName=HCSR_RECORDS_AND_REGISTRATION&EOPP.SCLabel=Records%20and%20Enrolment&EOPP.SCPTfname=HCSR_RECORDS_AND_REGISTRATION&FolderPath=PORTAL_ROOT_OBJECT.HCSR_RECORDS_AND_REGISTRATION.HCSR_GRADUATION.UOA_GRAD_WEB_FORM_GBL&IsFolder=false">https://www.student.admin.auckland.ac.nz/psp/ps/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/UOA_DEVELOPMENT.UOA_GRAD_WEB_FORM.GBL?PORTALPARAM_PTCNAV=UOA_GRAD_WEB_FORM_GBL&amp;EOPP.SCNode=HRMS&amp;EOPP.SCPortal=EMPLOYEE&amp;EOPP.SCName=HCSR_RECORDS_AND_REGISTRATION&amp;EOPP.SCLabel=Records%20and%20Enrolment&amp;EOPP.SCPTfname=HCSR_RECORDS_AND_REGISTRATION&amp;FolderPath=PORTAL_ROOT_OBJECT.HCSR_RECORDS_AND_REGISTRATION.HCSR_GRADUATION.UOA_GRAD_WEB_FORM_GBL&amp;IsFolder=false</a> and log in. Select the ‘Graduation Marshalling’ button to access the form, your regalia requirements can be entered on the form before submitting.</p>
<p>Please complete the form by close of business on Friday 11th April.</p>
<p>While we endeavour to assign roles to as many staff as possible, not all staff may be assigned a role. If you do not receive a role, it is because more staff than we have roles for have requested to marshal during a ceremony.</p>
<p>Once roles have been assigned, a detailed list of duties will be forwarded to all participants who have been assigned a role. Briefings will be held for staff who have been assigned roles. Details for the briefings are as follows, please note the dates and times in case you are selected for a role.</p>
<p>Briefing # 1- Wednesday 7th May (Section Coordinators and Section Checkers) – 1.30 pm via Zoom
Briefing # 2 - Wednesday 7th May (for roles inside the auditorium) – 2.30 pm via Zoom</p>
<p>Briefing # 1- Thursday 8th May (Section Coordinators and Section Checkers) – 10.am via Zoom
Briefing # 2- Thursday 8th May (for roles inside the auditorium) – 11 am via Zoom</p>
<p>If you cannot attend one of the briefing sessions, you must contact the Graduation Office regarding training. There is no opportunity on the day of graduation to direct people in their tasks, so we can’t roster staff to help if they do not attend a briefing.</p>
<p>The schedule of ceremonies and information regarding marshalling is available on the staff intranet<a href="https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/staff-intranet/teaching-and-students/services-for-students/graduation-2">https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/staff-intranet/teaching-and-students/services-for-students/graduation-2</a>.</p>
