<p>Bargaining Update</p>
<p>There were two bargaining meetings this week; one where your bargaining teams put forward new proposals that could potentially settle bargaining and one where we tried to tidy up other outstanding issues.</p>
<p>In the interest of reaching a settlement, the Professional team has made the call to withdraw the claim to include H band in coverage of the Collective Agreement. Thank you to those H band members who gave feedback to the reps and organisers on this issue. As H band staff will remain on IEAs for now, you should soon be receiving advice from the Vice Chancellor re your terms and conditions.</p>
<p>The Academic team has also made the call to withdraw the claim for Academic casuals to be covered. There are only a tiny number of staff on legitimate Academic casuals, and these are normally people like guest lecturers. If you have concerns about an Academic Causal contract, please contact the organisers.</p>
<p>In other news, the TEU’s Industrial Officer has written to the Vice Chancellor with serious concerns about whether your employer is acting in good faith. This particularly concerns the pay offer to non-union members and the employer’s position on back pay, along with communications to new TEU members stating that their previously agreed pay rises will be removed. If you are a new member of the TEU who has received such a communication, please get in touch with the organisers at and have not yet spoken to the organisers about it, please get in touch with them on <a href="mailto:nicole.wallace@teu.ac.nz">nicole.wallace@teu.ac.nz</a> and <a href="mailto:yasmine.serhan@teu.ac.nz">yasmine.serhan@teu.ac.nz</a>.</p>
<p>Strike Deductions: With Hono now up and running (see below), the suspension from the strike has now come through. Remember to check any pay dock is correct and that you have only been docked for time you would otherwise have been working, especially if you are a part time or shift worker. GTAs, TAs and Casual staff should not have been docked. Applications for the strike fund can also now be processed. If the loss of money from the strike is hard for you, apply for the fund by emailing <a href="mailto:strikefund@teu.ac.nz">strikefund@teu.ac.nz</a> with the following info:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>A brief explanation of why you need support - think a sentence or two.</li>
<li>A payslip showing the loss of salary</li>
<li>Your bank account details
Nicole sent an email with details on pay docking and the strike to members on 05/03/2025.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hono Blues: A number of Hono issues are coming through. Our organisers are prioritising resolving any payment issues, but are also aware of problems with leave balances and missing steps in onboarding, and are working through these. If you are having one of these problems, please get in contact with University HR first, and if the issue is not resolved, advise the organisers of your issue and what the employer’s response has been (see Other reminder below for contact details). Documenting the problem is part of solving the problem.</p>
<p>Reminder for casual staff – if you are asked to pay back money received over the Hono shutdown period, do not agree to do so until you get advice from an organiser.</p>
<p>Faculty Merger and Council meeting.  Earlier this year, Senate overwhelmingly declined to support the proposed merger of the Law and Business Schools.  This month’s Council’s agenda called for consideration of the merger proposal to take place without public access and therefore without transparency. The TEU wrote to the Chancellor challenging the rationale for Council having behind-closed-doors discussions on this matter and stated that any rationale was outweighed by public interest. The TEU believes that neither the Employment Relations Act 2000 nor the current Academic Staff Collective Agreement are compatible with Council considering the merger in isolation of affected staff. We weren’t the only ones to challenge this and it seems that by the time the TEU letter was received, the VC had already decided to remove the item from the private part of the  agenda. It will now be on the agenda for an “extraordinary” meeting of Council before the end of March and will be in public.

<p>Tertiary education: Not a Priority. We are concerned about the Government’s intention to shift public funding from non-priority provision “to ensure funding is directed towards the government&#39;s priority areas.” Worse still, we should prepare instructed about what we teach to teach based on which way the political wind is blowing.

<p>New collective agreements at Massey and Canterbury. Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union members at Te Kunenga ki Pūrehuroa | Massey University have voted to ratify a new collective agreement. Covering a range of workers from gardeners and technicians to tutors and lecturers, the agreement delivers improved pay and conditions that include an approximate 6% pay increase over 2 years, improved parental leave rights, and more for union members covered by the collective agreement. TEU members at Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | The University of Canterbury have also ratified a new collective agreement that includes increases totalling 5% over two years, automatic pay progression for maintenance staff who were previously without it, and an overhauled salary scale for medical practitioners. Members at Canterbury also successfully fought off an employer claim to remove retirement leave for new staff.

<p>Trump looms large.

Travel advisories suggest phones be sterilised of anything that might be construed as anti-Trump. Travellers whose passport lists gender as X will be under increased scrutiny at the US border. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/trump-musk-french-scientist-detained">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/trump-musk-french-scientist-detained</a>.
