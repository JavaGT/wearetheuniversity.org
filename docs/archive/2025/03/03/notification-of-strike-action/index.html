<p>We have received notice that Tertiary Education Union (TEU) and E tū members who are covered by the current bargaining for the University of Auckland Academic Staff Collective Agreement, Professional Staff Collective Agreement, Medical Academics Collective Agreement and Security &amp; Gardeners Collective Agreement will be taking strike action this Thursday, 6 March 2025 between 10.30am and 2.30pm.  (Note: we have not received notification from the PSA, so this message does not apply to them.)</p>
<p>During this strike period, union members have given notice that they do not intend to perform any work.</p>
<p>As we have previously communicated, bargaining has been on-going since early July 2024.  Medical Academics bargaining began in August 2024.  In these good faith discussions, the University has presented a pay offer that recognises cost-of-living pressures for our employees.  Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach agreement to date.  We are therefore disappointed to have again received notice of strike action.</p>
<p>The University acknowledges the right of union members to strike and staff who participate in lawful strike action are entitled to do so.</p>
<p>We have compiled some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for staff regarding strike action (below) and we will be communicating further with union members and managers ahead of the strike.  Note: this email is for all staff, whether union members or not, to provide information on the upcoming strike action.  Union members will also receive separate communications.  If you receive those separate union member communications and you do not believe you are a member of the union, please contact <a href="mailto:strike.notification@auckland.ac.nz">strike.notification@auckland.ac.nz</a>.</p>
<p>We remain committed to bargaining in good faith and are hopeful that we will be able to find a constructive solution to address any issues through the bargaining process.</p>
<p>During the strike, we will maintain business as usual, prioritising the minimisation of any impact on our students’ education while also providing support to staff.</p>

<p> FAQs – Strike action</p>
<p>What is the University’s approach to strike action?
The University is committed to continuing to teach, research and to serve its communities during strike action.  We also work to minimise any disruption or other negative effects on students and staff as far as possible.</p>
<p>Who can strike?
The intended strike action is in relation to collective bargaining currently in progress for the University of Auckland and relates to TEU and E tū members covered by current bargaining for the Academic, Medical Academics, Security &amp; Gardeners and Professional Staff Collective Agreements.  Only those members can take strike action.  This means people currently covered by one of these agreements, along with Academic casual staff and Professional staff members who are in Band H.</p>
<p>Non-union staff and staff who are members of other unions and employed under different collective agreements cannot lawfully strike at this time.</p>
<p>What if I do not want to strike?
The strike notices issued by the TEU and E tū are given on behalf of all members covered by the Academic, Medical Academic, Security &amp; Gardeners and Professional bargaining.  Therefore, the University will assume all union members covered by the notices will be on strike for the full period set out in the strike notice.</p>
<p>We recognise that employees have the lawful right to strike, and no adverse view will be taken of this.  However, previous experience suggests that for a variety of reasons there may be individuals who, while covered by the strike notice, do not actually participate in the strike.</p>
<p>Any staff who do not intend to participate in the strike action will need to inform their managers as soon as possible.  They should also email <a href="mailto:strike.notification@auckland.ac.nz">strike.notification@auckland.ac.nz</a> (copying their manager or Academic Head) of their intention not to strike.</p>
<p>Do I get paid when I am on strike?
The employer is entitled to withhold pay from employees who participate in strike action.</p>
<p>Employees who participate in strike action will be suspended and are not entitled to be paid for the duration of the strike.</p>
<p>What if a strike occurs when I usually take my lunch break?
As the strike notice informs the University you are on strike, you will be regarded as being on strike and not on your lunch break and therefore salary will be deducted equivalent to the duration of the strike.</p>
<p>What if I am on approved leave e.g. sick leave, annual leave, research and study leave when a strike occurs?
If you are on approved leave, the University will regard you as being on leave and not being on strike for the period of time the approved leave and the strike overlap.</p>
<p>If I go on strike can I avoid losing any salary by making up for the time spent on strike by working additional time later in the day or week?
No, it is not possible to do this.</p>
<p>I am on leave/not working during the strike action, but I want deductions made from my pay in solidarity with union members who are going on strike.
If you are on leave or not scheduled to work, it is not possible to take strike action.  That means that you cannot be suspended and we are not able to make deductions from your pay.</p>
<p>I don’t want to take strike action for the whole strike period notified by my union – can I choose to strike for a shorter or different period?
If you are covered by the strike notice and you participate in the strike, you will need to be treated as being on strike for the full duration of the strike set out in that notice.  It is not possible to choose to participate in part of the strike or to take strike action at a different time.</p>
<p>I work part-time or variable hours and I am not scheduled to work for the full period of the strike.  What will happen with my pay?
In this case, you will be suspended, but the deduction from your pay will only cover the hours that you were scheduled to work during the strike period.</p>
<p>If you work flexible/variable hours, but you do not have these recorded in your work schedule or formalised, please contact <a href="mailto:strike.notification@auckland.ac.nz">strike.notification@auckland.ac.nz</a> (copying your manager or Academic Head) before the strike, to confirm your working hours, so we can be sure we make the correct deductions.</p>
<p>Can my manager try to persuade me not to go on strike and can there be other consequences if I go on strike?
No. The University recognises the lawful right to strike and therefore your manager cannot attempt to persuade you not to strike.  They can ask you if you intend to take strike action.</p>
<p>Covering the work of striking staff
Non-striking staff who are not employed principally to do the work of a striking employee can be requested to do the work of staff on strike.  New staff cannot be employed to do their work.</p>
<p>Staff have the right to refuse to do the work of striking staff, unless it is already within the scope of their usual duties.</p>
<p>Further information or advice
Union members should contact their union representative for further information or advice.</p>
<p>All other staff requiring further information or advice, should contact their manager, their HR Manager or email <a href="mailto:a.phipps@auckland.ac.nz">strike.notification@auckland.ac.nz</a></p>
