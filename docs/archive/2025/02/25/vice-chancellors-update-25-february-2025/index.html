<p>With Orientation commencing this week, it’s wonderful to see our campuses busy and active with new and returning students for 2025. Enrolment numbers this semester appear to be strong, with healthy increases across both domestic and international cohorts compared to 2023 and 2024. Thanks to the many teams across the University who support and guide our students through the application and enrolment process.</p>

<p>Official opening of Hiwa
It was an honour to formally open Hiwa, our new recreation centre. It was also a pleasure to lead the VC’s team in an intense game of netball against a (fast and formidable) student team alongside our special guest, Hon Chris Bishop MP, who also graced the netball court. Minister Bishop described Hiwa as “a remarkable facility for the University, but also for the city, and the whole country”.

<p>Business School accreditations
Excellent news from the Business School, which has successfully completed renewals for three prestigious international accreditations, placing it among the top 1 percent of business schools globally. Ours is the first business school in Australasia to achieve this ‘triple crown’ accreditation in 2004 and to maintain it consistently for two decades. It underlines the Business School’s exceptional reputation and performance across teaching, research and industry engagement.
