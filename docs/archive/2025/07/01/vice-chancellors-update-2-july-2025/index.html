<p>I hope you all get some time to pause and recharge over the mid-semester break. As we move into the second half of the year, I would like to share some recent news from across our University community.</p>
<p>Selina Tusitala Marsh appointed inaugural Commonwealth Poet Laureate
Professor Selina Tusitala Marsh has been appointed the inaugural Commonwealth Poet Laureate. This is an historic honour in the Commonwealth’s 75-year history, and a wonderful recognition of the power of the arts and humanities to connect and inspire us. I look forward to seeing all that Selina will bring to this important new role. Congratulations!

<p>New short courses marketplace
The University is launching a new short courses marketplace, UoA Short Courses, which will make it easier for prospective learners to find and register for our wide range of offerings in one place. This is an important step in supporting our strategy to be a leading provider of lifelong learning for working professionals.
