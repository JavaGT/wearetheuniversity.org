<p>Thank you to everyone who attended our Town Hall meetings last week. It was valuable to hear your views and questions on the issues that matter to you.</p>
<p>A reminder that the final Town Hall will be held online on Wednesday 23 July, for those of you who were unable to join us in person. This is an opportunity to hear updates from across the University and to ask questions, so I hope you’ll join us.</p>

<p>UBIQ bookstore in liquidation
Sadly, the University has been notified that UBIQ, the bookstore on our City Campus, was put into liquidation on 2 July. It is expected to remain open for the start of Semester Two until Sunday 31 August. The University is working closely with the liquidator to minimise disruption, including the honouring of gift vouchers and ensuring that our students receive their prepaid books. More information on how to redeem gift vouchers is available on our Notice pages<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/notices/2025/ubiq-bookstore-in-liquidation.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/notices/2025/ubiq-bookstore-in-liquidation.html</a>.</p>
