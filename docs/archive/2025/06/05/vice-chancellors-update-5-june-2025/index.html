<p>With Semester One drawing to a close, I wanted to share a few key updates from across the University.</p>
<p>Update on Business &amp; Economics and Law faculty proposal
Following a wide-ranging engagement process, the University has decided to pause the proposal to combine the Faculties of Business &amp; Economics and Law. Instead, we will support a suite of collaborative faculty initiatives that respond to the challenges driving the original proposal – and reflect the extensive feedback we received from across the University community.</p>
<p>This revised approach, co-developed by the Dean of Business &amp; Economics and the Acting Dean of Law, aims to support collaboration and innovation while preserving the identity of each faculty.</p>
<p>You can read more about the rationale, initiatives and next steps on the notice page<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/notices/2025/proposed-new-faculty-business-economics-law.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/notices/2025/proposed-new-faculty-business-economics-law.html</a>.</p>
<p>King’s Birthday Honours 2025
Congratulations to the staff who were named in this year’s King’s Birthday Honours list. It’s wonderful to see their well-earned achievements recognised in this way. You can read more about this year’s recipients on the News pages<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2025/06/03/university-academics-recognised-in-kings-birthday-honours.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2025/06/03/university-academics-recognised-in-kings-birthday-honours.html</a>.</p>
<p>Collective bargaining
I am pleased to confirm that we have reached agreement with union members in relation to Academic, Medical Academic, Professional and Security &amp; Gardeners staff collective bargaining.</p>
<p>This follows extended negotiations over many months and recent mediated bargaining sessions with MBIE, which resulted in an offer being taken out to members and accepted.</p>
<p>This offer included a general salary revision of 3% effective 30 May 2025 and 2% on 1 February 2026.  For staff paid $70,000 or lower there is an additional 0.5% enhanced increase this year and a further 0.25% in 2026.</p>
<p>I would like to thank all those involved for their constructive efforts to get us to this point in what has been a challenging process.</p>
<p>Appointment of Director, Student and Scholarly Services
I am pleased to confirm that Sue Roberts has been appointed Director of the new Student and Scholarly Services division, part of the changes underway across the Enabling Environment portfolio<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/intranet/stay-informed/improvement-projects-programmes/enabling-environment-operations-portfolio-changes.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/intranet/stay-informed/improvement-projects-programmes/enabling-environment-operations-portfolio-changes.html</a>.

<p>Safety on campus
As the days get shorter and winter sets in, it’s a good time to be mindful of your surroundings and take sensible precautions when moving around our campuses after dark. You can find practical tips on personal safety, including what to do if you feel unsafe, on our website<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/emergency-information/personal-security/personal-safety-threats.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/emergency-information/personal-security/personal-safety-threats.html</a>.</p>
