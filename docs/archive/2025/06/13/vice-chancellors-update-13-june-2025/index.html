<p>Pacific Strategy
The University’s inaugural Pacific Strategy, Ala o le Moana, was launched this week at the Fale Pasifika. Developed with a strong Pacific lens, it reflects our commitment to Pacific communities and responds to their needs, values, aspirations and experiences. My thanks to Pro Vice-Chancellor Pacific, Professor Jemaima Tiatia-Siau, for her leadership, and to everyone who helped shape this important strategy.
