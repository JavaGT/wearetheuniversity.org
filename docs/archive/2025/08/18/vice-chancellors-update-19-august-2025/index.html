<p>Appointment of the Chief Operating Officer &amp; Registrar
Following an international search, I am pleased to announce that Mark Gregory will commence as our new Chief Operating Officer and Registrar in December.</p>
<p>We are deeply appreciative of Adrienne Cleland for her longstanding leadership of the Enabling Environment portfolio, and to Tim Bluett for stepping up to facilitate leadership of a range of University-wide projects.  Both Adrienne and Tim will continue in role until later in the year, enabling a smooth transition for Mark.</p>
<p>Retirement of Professor Nuala Gregory
Professor Nuala Gregory, Dean, Te Pūtahi Mātauranga, Faculty of Arts and Education, has announced her intention to retire and return to Ireland early next year, after serving the University for nearly 28 years in a number of academic and leadership positions. There will be an opportunity to reflect on Nuala’s contribution and achievements at her farewell to be scheduled early next year.</p>
<p>Kōrero Mai Staff Engagement Survey
Thank you to everyone who participated in the recent Kōrero Mai Staff Engagement Survey. I’m pleased to share that 70 percent of eligible staff took part. This is a strong response that reflects a shared desire to keep improving the experience of working at the University and one that sits above the 65 percent average for comparable higher education institutions in Oceania. In the coming weeks, the survey findings will be reviewed to identify the areas where change will have the greatest impact.

<p>All-staff forum update
