<p><strong>Thursday, 13 December 2001, 10:18 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Coromandel MP and Green Party Co-leader, Jeanette Fitzsimons is returning to her electorate to see for herself the damage from the latest subsidence in Waihi.</p>
<p>She is also calling for an inquiry into the spate of slips to plague the town, but one not organised by the mining company.</p>
<p>&quot;Although much of Waihi sits above old mine tunnels, I note that this is the third subsidence in the area of town immediately adjacent to the existing mine,&quot; said Ms Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>&quot;The existing mine continues to pump thousands of cubic metres of water a day out of the ground, while blasting can be felt all the way across the town.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An engineering consultant&#39;s report after the last subsidence found no connection between the collapse and the activities of the existing mine,&quot; said Ms Fitzsimons. &quot;However, this &#39;coincidence&#39; is getting harder to believe with every subsequent collapse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We must have an independent inquiry into the causes of the last three collapses, with contestable evidence offered from geologists and engineers,&quot; said Ms Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>&quot;The community needs to know.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons will visit Waihi this afternoon to check on the safety of the residents and see for herself the damage caused by the latest slip.</p>
