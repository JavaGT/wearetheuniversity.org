<p><strong>Tuesday, 18 December 2001, 4:30 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Green co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said today proposed changes to the Resource Management Act show the Government has lost its nerve and is rolling over for big property developers.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is backtracking on decisions it made when the bill was in select committee, under pressure from property developers who have always opposed the public having a say in their schemes.&quot;</p>
<p>The Government has proposed two changes - it will remove the proposed appeal rights to the Environment Court and it will permit limited notification of resource consents for activities with &#39;minor&#39; effects.</p>
<p>&quot;These two change will work together in a pernicious way to shut out the public,&quot; said Ms Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>&quot;More than 95 percent of all applications under the RMA are not notified for public submissions. The High Court has found a number of cases which were not notified but which should have been under the law.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just the tip of the iceberg as it costs thousands of dollars to go through a High Court appeal. That is why the select committee and environmental groups supported the proposal to allow Environment Court review of notification decisions.</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons said limited notification worsens the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently if a council fails to notify when it should, and an objection is brought by a neighbour, this brings it to the attention of the public at large, who can then participate in the process.</p>
<p>&quot;Under the Government proposed changes, even this opportunity will be lost - and there will be no way to challenge council decisions other than highly expensive appeals to the High Court.</p>
<p>&quot;Even National&#39;s Simon Upton, who wrote the amendment bill which the House is still considering, supported the right to appeal to the Environment Court.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect that the National Party will be sticking up for his original clause, and will therefore oppose its deletion by the Government.</p>
<p>&quot;The Green Party will not be supporting these amendments.&quot;</p>
