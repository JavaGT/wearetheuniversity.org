<p>DEFU Shows Increased Debt and Increased Risk</p>
<p>Tuesday 18 Dec 2001 Rodney Hide Press Releases -- Economy</p>
<p>ACT Finance Spokesman MP Rodney Hide said today that the December Economic and Fiscal Update (DEFU) showed a Government borrowing ever more, exposing taxpayers to increased commercial risk.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is borrowing $10.6 billion over the next five years - $1.5 billion more than just six months ago. The increase is due to Air New Zealand, increased student loans, and refinancing District Health Boards. The blow-out is completely policy driven.</p>
<p>&quot;Increased borrowing means increased risk for taxpayers.</p>
<p>&quot;Of the $10.6 billion in borrowings, $7.9 billion for Cullen&#39;s Super scheme. Michael Cullen&#39;s biggest fiscal risk is the very scheme that is supposed to give security in retirement. He is borrowing every one of the $7.9 billion that he is putting aside for our future pensions. This fact is made plain in Table 3.2. The strategy is very risky - it&#39;s just like mortgaging your house to play the stock market in the hope of striking it lucky.</p>
<p>&quot;The table on page 68 of the DEFU reveals just what a financial wizard Michael Cullen thinks he is. The table shows he is planning to borrow at 6.2 percent to invest on world share markets, to return a hoped for 9.4 percent. That is true financial wizardry. Michael Cullen believes that he can make $32 million a year for every billion he borrows and invests on behalf of taxpayers.</p>

<p>&quot;It sounds too good to be true - and it is. Michael Cullen has no track history in investing his own money let alone anyone else&#39;s and here he is borrowing billions to play the world&#39;s financial markets. It&#39;s nuts. The best security for the future would be to cancel the scheme and drop the borrowing.</p>
