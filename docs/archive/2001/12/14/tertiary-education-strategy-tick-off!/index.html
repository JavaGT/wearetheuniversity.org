Tick Off!</h1>
<p><strong>Friday, 14 December 2001, 9:18 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>13 December 2001</p>
<p>In its fourth report, released last month, TEAC had gone a long way towards some concrete suggestions on how to move forward in tertiary education, National&#39;s Tertiary Education spokesperson, Maurice Williamson said today.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s unfortunate that TEAC&#39;s Minister has rejected those suggestions and, instead, released a report today that tells us nothing more than that he &#39;likes education&#39;. Taxpayers should be asking for their money back.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, the draft Tertiary Education Strategy states that the Government is going to &#39;develop the skills and knowledge New Zealanders need for our knowledge society&#39;, but what does that actually tell us?</p>
<p>The Strategy document is nothing more than a tome of touchy, feely platitudes which concludes by asking New Zealanders to assist the Minister in setting out tertiary education policy for the next five years by ticking a series of boxes.</p>
<p>&quot;After nine years in Opposition and two years in Government, Mr Maharey still hasn&#39;t told us where he wants to take tertiary education. A box-ticking approach to policy development is a farce.</p>
