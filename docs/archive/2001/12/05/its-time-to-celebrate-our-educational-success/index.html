<p><strong>Wednesday, 5 December 2001, 1:08 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>‘Results of the OECD study on educational achievement of NZ students compared with other nations puts paid to the myth that our education system is failing miserably,’ NZ First Education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly.</p>
<p>‘Mean rankings of the three areas, reading, mathematics and science, places NZ as the second country in the world. A whole lot of people can take credit for that but it refutes the claims of politicians and media that our schools are failing.’</p>
<p>‘It is time that we recognised that NZ has a very good system with largely high quality teachers and parents supportive of and involved in the school’s work’.</p>
<p>‘We can never afford to become complacent. The 8% of girls and 18% of boys who scored at level 1 or below on the reading literacy assessment represent a real challenge. However we can and should celebrate our success.’</p>
<p>‘It is particularly gratifying to have cleaned up the Aussies in all areas,’ said Mr Donnelly.</p>
