<p><strong>Wednesday, 12 December 2001, 4:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University">Massey University</a></strong></p>
<p>The events of September 11 have not impacted greatly on the rural property market, which has recorded a positive outlook for the seventh consecutive quarter according to a Massey University survey.</p>
<p>The University’s Real Estate Analysis Unit’s latest rural market real estate survey has recorded a positive outlook on the back of good commodity prices, a low kiwi dollar and low interest rates, despite the changed economic climate after the events of September 11.</p>
<p>The survey forecasts increased levels of sales for dairy farms (net 29%), hill country sheep and beef farms (net 36%) and arable/fattening farms (net 27%), compared with the same period last year.</p>
<p>For the third consecutive quarter the survey is less optimistic about sales volumes. Forestry sales are forecast to remain the same and horticultural property turnover rates are predicted to fall (-15% net).</p>
<p>Further price increase are forecast for dairy farms (net 22%), hill country sheep and beef farms (net 36%) and arable/fattening farms (net 36%).</p>
<p>The outlook for the pastoral sector remains positive but has declined by an appreciable amount since the last survey. It is likely that uncertainties about the impact of a slowing world economy and the war in Afghanistan have impacted on this decline.</p>
<p>The survey predicts there is a possibility the rural market may well be near the peak of the current cycle.</p>
<p>The outlook for horticultural blocks is that market prices will remain unchanged and there is a negative outlook for forestry (-7% net).</p>
<p>The survey is based on confidential questionaries completed by a panel of rural real estate market experts from the banking, real estate and valuation professions. Readers are reminded that it takes a “broad brush” approach to forecasting changes in the rural property market.  </p>
