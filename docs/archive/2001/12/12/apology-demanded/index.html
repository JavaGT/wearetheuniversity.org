<p>12 December 2001 Media Statement</p>
<p>Apology demanded</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton is demanding a parliamentary apology from Act MP Rodney Hide following false allegations made by Mr Hide against an Industry New Zealand staff member.</p>
<p>In Parliament yesterday, Rodney Hide claimed that an Industry New Zealand Manager, Paul Frater, owned two companies that ‘have received tens of thousands of dollars as subcontractors to regional councils’.</p>
<p>But Jim Anderton says Mr Frater sold his shareholding in the companies before he took up his position at Industry New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The allegation that Mr Hide made under parliamentary privilege was false. It was a smear that lacks any credibility whatsoever.</p>
<p>“When Mr Frater joined Industry New Zealand he sold his shares in the consulting companies named by Mr Hide. Industry New Zealand staff are required to complete a disclosure of interest.</p>
<p>“Mr Hide claimed that documents he tabled supported his claim that Mr Frater owned the companies he named. The tabled documents did not.</p>
<p>“I have personally seen the documents showing the transfer of ownership. They confirm that the allegations made by Mr Hide were wrong.</p>
<p>“In my view, Mr Hide deliberately misled Parliament.</p>
<p>“Mr Hide has a nasty habit of smearing people in parliament. His allegations on this occasion are wrong and indefensible. He owes Mr Frater and Parliament an apology,” Jim Anderton said.</p>
