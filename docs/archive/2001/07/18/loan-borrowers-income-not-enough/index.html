<p><strong>Wednesday, 18 July 2001, 2:32 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>**Loan Borrowers’ Income Not Enough To Sustain Fee Rises<br>**<br>Nearly 70% of student loan borrowers earn under the repayment threshold, according to IRD statistics released today by the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>“It’s clear that many graduates are not earning enough to ever pay off their student loans,” said Andrew Campbell, NZUSA Co-President. “Tertiary institutions must be aware that their threats of increased fees for next year will mean that thousands more students will be shackled with huge debts for life.”</p>
<p>The income range of student loan borrowers at 31 March 1999 (figures for the 2000 tax year are still not available) show that 69.94% of the 256,922 borrowers were earning less than $15,000 per year. On this income they would not be making any repayments on their student loans.</p>
<p>“While it is important to acknowledge that a significant proportion of those earning under the repayment threshold will be current students, it is also shocking that only 12% of borrowers earned over $30,000 a year,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“Basically all student loan borrowers – 98% - were making less than $50,000 each year. These figures show that graduates are not walking into the high paying jobs that many think they are,” said Campbell. “Vice-Chancellors should be aware that if they raise fees they will be loading more and more debt on to graduates whose salaries cannot sustain loan repayments.”</p>
<p>“Tertiary institutions and government must work together to ensure that student loans do not get any bigger because of fee increases,” said Andrew Campbell.</p>
