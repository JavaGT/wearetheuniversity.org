<p>&quot;Have a heart!&quot;</p>
<p>The Green Party is calling on the Labour-led Government to show some compassion for New Zealand&#39;s 18,000 clothing workers by pulling out of free trade negotiations with Hong Kong which are underway this week.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour and the Alliance know full well the negative impact a free trade agreement with Hong Kong would have on 18,000 New Zealand clothing workers, the companies they work for and the communities they live in,&quot; said Green Party co-leader Rod Donald.</p>
<p>&quot;Why is the Government deliberately sacrificing thousands of the country most vulnerable workers in order to pursue a trade agreement which defies common sense?</p>
<p>&quot; New Zealand exporters already have 100 percent open access to the Hong Kong market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot; Hong Kong has no commitment to implementing meaningful Rules of Origin to ensure &#39;Made in Hong Kong&#39; really means products are made in Hong Kong.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Donald said that United States Customs reports highlighted considerable problems policing Rules of Origin; both in determining whether products fitted the rules and in policing Hong Kong exporters who kept breaking the rules.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand Customs will face even greater difficulty stopping the illegal transport of cheap Chinese goods through Hong Kong given its small size and stretched resources.</p>
<p>&quot;The Hong Kong agreement is lose - lose for New Zealand - in increase in trade access AND certain loss of local jobs,&quot; said Mr Donald.</p>
<p>&quot;The Green Party calls on the Government parties to have a heart by protecting New Zealand jobs against unscrupulous practices by Hong Kong exporters.</p>
<p>&quot;Compelling evidence confirms that the only effective way to achieve this is to keep the current tariff regime in place for textile, clothing and footwear,&quot; he said.</p>
