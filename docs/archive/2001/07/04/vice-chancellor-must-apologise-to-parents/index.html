<p>University Vice Chancellor Must Apologise To Parents</p>
<p>The Waikato University vice-chancellor must immediately withdraw his promise to bar New Zealand students with foreign high school qualifications, ACT MP Donna Awatere Huata said today.</p>
<p>&quot;I seek a full apology from Mr Gould to parents throughout New Zealand,&quot; Mrs Awatere Huata said.</p>
<p>Mr Gould&#39;s politically-motivated comments are being used by Education Minister Trevor Mallard as an argument for the implementation of the NCEA high school qualification. Mr Gould says he does not want to &#39;undermine&#39; the new qualification by accepting New Zealand students with foreign qualifications.</p>
<p>Some of New Zealand&#39;s best schools are choosing to offer British A-Levels and baccalaureate exams because the NCEA is fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p>&quot;If Mr Gould chooses to reject students from these schools in order to impress his Labour friends, then his institution will suffer.</p>
<p>&quot;One in ten students at Waikato University are international students, who pay higher fees than New Zealand students. Mr Gould&#39;s objection to foreign qualifications is obviously overcome by a few dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;A ban would be racist and hypocritical.</p>
<p>&quot;His politically-motivated meddling is unwelcome here,&quot; Donna Awatere Huata said.</p>
