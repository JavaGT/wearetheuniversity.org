<p><strong>Wednesday, 4 July 2001, 2:49 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>The case of a convicted rapist held in jail &#39;illegally&#39; for 15 months - after two-thirds of his sentence, but still within the ten years the judge handed down - highlights a need for law change, ACT Justice Spokesman MP Stephen Franks said today.</p>
<p>&quot;This wouldn&#39;t be an issue if we had truth in sentencing: ten years should mean ten years.</p>
<p>&quot;The law surrounding early release brims with naïve, good intentions. The result is an unworkable tangle of patched-up legislation. The Government&#39;s proposed sentencing changes will not fix the problem. They will widen the discretionary power to let criminals out early.</p>
<p>&quot;Richard Hunia should have had no prospect of early release whatsoever. Hunia - convicted for rape, abduction and threatening to kill - was sentenced to ten years. Yet he spent just eight years behind bars, and is claiming a hundred thousand dollars for being there &#39;too long&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Hunia was released on trust once before: he broke his parole by raping, abducting and threatening to kill a woman, inflicting &quot;every indignity one could imagine&quot; according to the sentencing judge. The statistics on reoffending would have warned the Government that Hunia had an 80 per cent likelihood of creating more victims if let out.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody ever intended criminals to prosper financially for being in jail. Hunia&#39;s victims didn&#39;t get $100,000. It will be scandalous if Hunia gets compensation while they get nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;Our law should be clear: the judge&#39;s sentence must be served in its entirety. Officials should not be authorised to subvert courtroom decisions,&quot; Mr Franks said.</p>
