<p><strong>Wednesday, 4 July 2001, 4:42 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Student_Choice">Student Choice</a></strong></p>
<p>If Otago University Students&#39; Association president Ayesha Verrall is opposed to an increase in the Otago student health levy, she should justify the 23% ($219,000) increase in the cost of OUSA membership imposed on Otago students this year, Student Choice spokesman Clint Heine said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year the compulsory OUSA levy was $65; this year it has increased 23% to $80 and raised the cost of OUSA membership by $219,000. OUSA now costs Otago students over one million dollars a year. If student politicians are so opposed to fee increases they should stop imposing new costs on students,&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>
<p>&quot;By facilitating compulsory membership of student associations the government handed these groups a blank cheque and student politicians are now filling in the figures. One million dollars is an outrageous amount of money to hand to student politicians and the Labour/Alliance government is largely responsible,&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>
<p>&quot;Student politicians support compulsory membership because they know that if students had a choice most wouldn&#39;t want to pay these excessive membership fees,&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>
<p>&quot;Ms Verrall is applying a double standard. She is opposed to increases in tuition and health fees but has defended the increase in the OUSA levy. Student politicians can&#39;t have it both ways - if they&#39;re against fee increases they should act to prevent the ongoing increase in student association levies,&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>
