<p>Gerry Brownlee National Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>24 July 2001</p>
<p>Innovation and competition cut out of tertiary education</p>
<p>Private Training Establishments look set to be the first casualty of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission, National&#39;s Education spokesperson Gerry Brownlee said today.</p>
<p>&quot;With the Minister conceding that today&#39;s moratorium on new Private Training Establishments is a &#39;signal for changes ahead for the PTE sector&#39;, alarm bells should be ringing in PTEs.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey&#39;s gentle suggestion that PTEs are to play &#39;a clear and distinctive complementary role&#39; to New Zealand&#39;s 36 public tertiary education providers is little more than a brutal salvo at the innovative end of tertiary education provision.</p>
<p>&quot;TEAC is not expected to report on funding options for the tertiary sector until later this year. Clearly today&#39;s announcement indicates TEAC will not be taking an independent stance on funding issues but rather they will be expected to reflect the Minister&#39;s own views which will be bad news for existing PTEs.</p>
<p>&quot;Why is this Government so frightened of competition? Mr Maharey, in suggesting that PTEs have moved &#39;up the framework and put pressure on public institutions&#39; concedes that they have been effective in offering an alternative tertiary education for many young New Zealanders, especially Maori and Pacific Island students.</p>
<p>&quot;This is another triumph for the commissars approach to education which is Labour&#39;s one-size-fits-all straight-jacketed fixation,&quot; Mr Brownlee said.</p>
