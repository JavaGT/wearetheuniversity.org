<p>Tragic Suspension Figures Highlight Education Failure</p>
<p>Appalling school suspension figures highlight gross failings in the education system, ACT Education spokesman Donna Awatere Huata said today.</p>
<p>&quot;I am disgusted that the number of kids suspended or stood down has doubled since 1997,&quot; Mrs Awatere Huata said.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year, 22,029 students were stood down or suspended from school. It is heartbreaking to discover that Maori kids accounted for 9067 of those stand-downs or suspensions. Quite simply, our education system fails Maori youth.</p>
<p>&quot;The richest schools have the lowest number of stand-downs and suspensions. Kids who come from destitute families are not naughtier than the rich kids down the road. The anomaly in suspension results is the tragic result of a system that dumps the poor kids - especially Maori and Pacific Islanders - at the bottom of the heap. We make these kids feel worthless, then wonder why they get into trouble.</p>
<p>&quot;When schools repeatedly stand-down the same child - as they did 2374 times last year, that kid is falling through the gaps and needs urgent help.</p>
<p>&quot;Too many schools lack the resources, expertise and motivation to cope with at-risk youth.</p>
<p>&quot;Charter Schools would provide an excellent solution. In overseas countries, Charter Schools cater for at-risk students with outstanding results.</p>
<p>&quot;This would provide an ideal option for students who are falling through the gaps. The schools would offer greater choice for parents and a second chance for children at risk,&quot; Donna Awatere Huata said.</p>
