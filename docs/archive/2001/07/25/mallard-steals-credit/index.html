<p>Mallard steals credit</p>
<p>It&#39;s typical of Education Minister Trevor Mallard to &#39;jump out in front of the parade and start waving a banner&#39; by claiming credit for the improvement in literacy standards from 1996 to 2000, National&#39;s Education spokesperson Gerry Brownlee said today.</p>
<p>&quot;All Mr Mallard did in his first few months as Education Minister was remove bulk funding and start Labour&#39;s process of clawing back the freedoms of Tomorrow&#39;s Schools.</p>
<p>&quot;None of his actions were focused on the learning needs of children. Now he has the gall to claim credit for results achieved in a period in which nothing he did could have had any impact.</p>
<p>&quot;The literacy strategy put in place by National aimed to ensure that &#39;every child could read, write and do maths for success by age nine&#39; has been a great success. Our primary schools put a real focus on the basics and now that&#39;s paying off in terms of better literacy standards.</p>
<p>&quot;The &#39;Feed the Mind&#39; campaign, launched by former Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, has encouraged parents and the community to play a part in helping children learn.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard can start crowing about results when he&#39;s had an influence on them. In the meantime, I suggest he concern himself with sorting out the mess that he&#39;s created with the National Certificate of Educational Achievement so our secondary students are encouraged to strive for excellence in their learning,&quot; Mr Brownlee said.</p>
