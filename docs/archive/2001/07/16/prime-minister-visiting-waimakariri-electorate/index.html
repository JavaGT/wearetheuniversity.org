<p><strong>Monday, 16 July 2001, 4:54 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Clayton Cosgrove Member of Parliament for Waimakariri is today (17 July) hosting the Prime Minister Rt Hon Helen Clark to the Waimakariri Electorate.</p>
<p>&quot;The Prime Minister and I will be visiting Bishopdale Primary School where the children are going to showcase their activities which will include some of their art work&quot;, Mr Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>The day also includes a visit to the Lignus Timber Exchange. This is a recently established company which has developed the first operational negotiation-based electronic exchange for forest products outside North America and is targeting the $600 billion USD world market.</p>
<p>Lignus is fine example of a smart Canterbury enterprise which links a traditional industry -timber production- with the latest e-commerce technology to trade globally. As the recently appointed Member of Parliament assisting the Minister for Information Technology on the E-commerce Task Force, Mr Cosgrove is keen to showcase innovative Canterbury businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;I am looking forward to hosting the Prime Minister and showing her some of the best that is in the Waimakariri Electorate - a superb and growing school providing high quality education and a world class business using &#39;home grown&#39; technology to compete in the international marketplace, &quot;Mr Cosgrove said.</p>
