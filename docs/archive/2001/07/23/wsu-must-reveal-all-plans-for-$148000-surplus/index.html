<p><strong>Monday, 23 July 2001, 4:06 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Student_Choice">Student Choice</a></strong></p>
<p>The Waikato Students&#39; Union (WSU) should reveal all the details surrounding the association&#39;s $148,000 budget surplus including its plans to spend almost $95,000 on an unidentified project, Student Choice spokesman Clint Heine said today.</p>
<p>Mr Heine said that the 2001 WSU budget shows a surplus of $148,000, which includes $94,476 from the proceeds of the sale of a house previously owned by the association. Notes to the budget say that the money from the house sale &quot;should not really be counted as part of our surplus&quot;, and says the money will &quot;be set aside for future use on a project for University Students on Campus&quot;. However the project is not priced or detailed in the budget.</p>
<p>Mr Heine said the proceeds of the sale must be treated as part of the surplus and the project has to be explained. &quot;WSU can&#39;t just put this money away without gaining their members&#39; approval through the budget process. Students have a right to know how WSU spends their money, but by failing to detail the project the association is keeping students in the dark,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Heine said it is possible WSU intend to use the house proceeds to purchase an FM radio frequency and broadcasting facilities. &quot;This would be a dubious venture because radio is a risky business and Hamilton already has a highly competitive radio market&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>Mr Heine said WSU&#39;s large surplus was a direct result of compulsory membership of the association reintroduced this year. &quot;At the time the Labour-Alliance government - with support of the vice-chancellors, AUS and student associations - was reimposing compulsory membership on Waikato students, we warned that it would give exorbitant amounts of money to student politicians&quot;, Mr Heine said.</p>
<p>&quot;This unexplained item of expenditure shows the government gave the student politicians at WSU a blank cheque and they&#39;re now filling in their own figures,&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>
