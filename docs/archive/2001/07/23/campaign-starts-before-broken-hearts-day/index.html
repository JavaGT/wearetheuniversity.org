<p><strong>Monday, 23 July 2001, 9:32 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>22 July 2001</p>
<p>National MP Tony Ryall says the Government&#39;s $300,000 campaign to inform New Zealanders about the implications of the Property (Relationships) Amendment Act is completely inadequate.</p>
<p>Radio New Zealand reported that a $300,000 advertising campaign for the new legislation starts today.</p>
<p>&quot;The Labour Government spent over $1.2 million on publicity for the Employment Relations Act.</p>
<p>&quot;The Property (Relationships) Act affects 236,000 New Zealanders in de facto relationships and hundreds of thousands in marriages and the Government is spending miles less than on the ERA.</p>
<p>&quot;Part of the legislation comes into effect in less than two weeks, on 1 August, when people can start contracting out. The full impact of the legislation comes into force on 1 February 2002. A $300,000 campaign starting today is pathetic.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is abdicating its responsibility to inform public about this legislation. Originally only $60,000 had been budgeted and the extra money only came out because of National&#39;s criticism.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is running a half-hearted campaign because it didn&#39;t want to do it in the first place.</p>
<p>&quot;31 January 2002 will be &#39;broken hearts day&#39; when couples all over New Zealand end their relationships to avoid being caught by the new legislation,&quot; Mr Ryall said.</p>
