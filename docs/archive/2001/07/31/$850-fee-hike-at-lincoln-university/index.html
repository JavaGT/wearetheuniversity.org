<p><strong>Tuesday, 31 July 2001, 3:26 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Lincoln University is estimating that a fee rise of more than $850 would be required to avoid service cutbacks as a result of the Government&#39;s &#39;woefully inadequate&#39; funding offer, National&#39;s Tertiary Education Spokesperson Maurice Williamson said today.</p>
<p>Information requested by National under the Official Information Act shows Lincoln University&#39;s council is considering various scenarios in light of the Government&#39;s funding offer.</p>
<p>&quot;A fee rise of up to 25%, or $850 per student, shows the extent of the funding problem. Lincoln pointed out in a covering letter that it would shy away from such a high fee rise but would seek a lower fee increase and service cutbacks.</p>
<p>&quot;Lincoln&#39;s financial situation combined with Massey&#39;s projected $11.5 million service cutbacks or 27% fee hike spell doom for agricultural research and study in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;How does the Government expect our country to capitalise on the knowledge wave with this sort of serious under-funding in our tertiary institutions?</p>
<p>&quot;Service cutbacks won&#39;t be confined to Massey and Lincoln. Universities throughout New Zealand will be forced to make service cutbacks as a result of Labour&#39;s failure to meet its pre-election pledge to reduce the cost of tertiary education for students. We shouldn&#39;t forget the pre-election promise of Labour&#39;s coalition partner, the Alliance, which promised to make tertiary education free.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders did not vote for a lower standard of tertiary education in order for Labour to claim it fulfilled its pledge to reduce the cost for students,&quot; Mr Williamson said.</p>
