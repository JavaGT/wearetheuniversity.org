<p><strong>Thursday, 5 July 2001, 4:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Gerry Brownlee National Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>5 July 2001</p>
<p>More questions raised about TEC</p>
<p>The Education Forum&#39;s report &#39;Shaping the Tertiary Education System - An Assessment of the Second Report of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission&#39; is a thoroughly researched report that cannot be ignored by the Government, National&#39;s Education spokesperson Gerry Brownlee said.</p>
<p>&quot;The report is written by Norman LaRocque, a person with extensive experience in education policy in both the New Zealand public service and internationally. It comes just days after papers were released showing that officials from major government departments have doubts about the plan to establish a Tertiary Education Commission.</p>
<p>&quot;The second TEAC report failed to make a case for the establishment of the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC). The Education Forum&#39;s report calls into question the TEC being responsible for both regulation and funding and the conflict that could create.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the current stand-off with tertiary institutions over fees, and advice from officials opposing the move to establish the TEC before decisions on the operating practices and funding allocation mechanisms have been made, the Government is forging ahead with its plans. The Tertiary Education Commission is due to come into existence next month.&quot;</p>
<p>The Treasury, Department of Labour, State Services Commission and Economic Development Ministry have all said there are &#39;better ways&#39; of achieving the Government&#39;s aims.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is making a hash of education policy. The political agenda to bring the whole education sector back under state control is taking precedence over good public policy.</p>
<p>&quot;The last people being considered in the Government&#39;s plans are students,&quot; Mr Brownlee said.</p>
