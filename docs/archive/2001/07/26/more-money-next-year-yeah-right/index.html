<p><strong>Thursday, 26 July 2001, 11:05 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National&#39;s Tertiary Education spokesperson Maurice Williamson today urged universities not to give in to blackmail from desperate Government Ministers over the fee freeze deal.</p>
<p>Mr Williamson likened the pressure on Government members over the funding deal to &#39;a powder keg about to blow&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour backbenchers are highly uncomfortable with the &#39;woefully inadequate&#39; funding offer. The Alliance members are in such a meltdown that they almost need counselling.</p>
<p>&quot;The pressure is continuing to build as the 31 August deadline creeps closer with no sign of more money this year - just pie in the sky promises about the possibility of extra money next year.</p>
<p>&quot;When the first fee freeze offer was made in the 2000 Budget, it was presented by the Government as a one-off move.</p>
<p>&quot;Now the Government has come back and is expecting universities to agree to yet another one-off fee freeze with promises of a better funding package next year. As the slogan for student beer Tui says - &#39;Yeah Right&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;If Vice Chancellors hold their nerve, the Government will be faced with no option but to adjust the offer. It will be a case of who blinks first loses.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour promised to reduce the cost of tertiary education for students. The Alliance promised to make it free! The Government don&#39;t want to go into an election year with students facing fee increases of up to 27% so they&#39;ll promise anything to get the universities to agree to the fee freeze.</p>
<p>&quot;I urge all tertiary institutions to keep applying pressure to local Labour and Alliance MPs. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, never have so few delivered so little to so many,&quot; Mr Williamson said.</p>
