<p><strong>Friday, 15 June 2001, 10:27 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT Education Spokesman Donna Awatere Huata - the only politician who has consistently opposed the National Certificate in Educational Achievement (NCEA) - today warned of a bleak future if the flawed scheme is implemented.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to have a two-tier education scheme in New Zealand: decent schools are going to offer baccalaureate or A Level examinations, while second-rate institutions will only provide the NCEA.</p>
<p>&quot;We are already seeing the split. Brave principals are standing up and rejecting the NCEA while others ignore huge concerns and going along with the scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;Wealthy, high-performing schools are refusing to have anything to do with the Certificate. They have the luxury of being able to afford to look at other options. Poorer schools don&#39;t. Our most destitute kids - Maori and Pacific Island youth - are going to suffer.</p>
<p>&quot;Employers are going to judge our kids based on the name of their school, because the NCEA doesn&#39;t give them any other way to accurately gauge performance.</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard is pushing through the NCEA at the cost of the future of thousands of our kids,&quot; Donna Awatere Huata said today.</p>
