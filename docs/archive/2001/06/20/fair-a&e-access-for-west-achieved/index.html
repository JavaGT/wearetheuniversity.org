<p><strong>Wednesday, 20 June 2001, 4:51 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>“I am delighted to confirm that all Ambulance transfers from West Auckland’s A&amp;E Center to North Shore Hospital are now free”, Titirangi MP David Cunliffe said today.</p>
<p>“For the last year I have lobbied hard to get West Aucklanders a fair deal on access to emergency health services”, David Cunliffe said. “The good news was confirmed at a meeting I had this week with Waitemata Health CEO Dwayne Crombie”.</p>
<p>“If you live on the North Shore and need extensive emergency care it has always been on your doorstep at North Shore Hospital.</p>
<p>“But if you live in the West and presented at Lincoln Road A&amp;E it cost you $80 for an ambulance to North Shore Hospital when you needed it.</p>
<p>“That was not fair. I campaigned against it. It has now been stopped. All Ambulance transfers are now free due to a new subsidy I fought hard for in this year’s budget”, the Titirangi MP said.</p>
<p>“Hon Annette King our Minister of Health was strongly supportive and I want to thank her and her advisers for their support”, David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“Waitemata Health has now, after some delay last year, fully implemented the new policy and I congratulate them for doing so”, he said.</p>
