<p>Mark Meets With Matt Over Corruption In Corrections</p>
<p>Ron Mark is pleased that the Hon Matt Robson, Minister of Corrections, has agreed to meet with him at 4pm today to discuss his concerns as to the manner in which Canterbury prisons have been operating.</p>
<p>“I have had many people express anger and frustration over a wide range of allegations such as fraud, ill treatment of prisoners and mismanagement of employees and it is my intent to put these to the Minister directly.</p>
<p>“I am acutely aware that many Corrections staff have a story to tell but are fearful of speaking out because any breach of the Corrections Code of Conduct would result in their dismissal.</p>
<p>“I am very grateful that the Minister has accorded me time to air these views so promptly,” said Mr Mark.</p>
