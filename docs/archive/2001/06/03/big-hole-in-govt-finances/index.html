<p>Big Hole in Govt Finances</p>
<p>Sunday 3rd Jun 2001 Richard Prebble Media Release -- Economy</p>
<p>Michael Cullen’s tax revenue forecasts have turned out to be hopelessly optimistic, leaving the government in a financial hole, ACT leader Richard Prebble said today.</p>
<p>In a speech to the Otago Merino Association in Queenstown, Mr Prebble said Labour’s election promises were based on a pledge to increase the top income tax rate to 39 cents which was expected to produce an additional $400 million in revenue.</p>
<p>The government also added another $100 million in cigarette taxes.</p>
<p>But tax revenue, instead of rising by $500 million as Michael Cullen expected, is projected to fall by $697 million this year.</p>
<p>Over four years, the loss in tax revenue is predicted to be $2.5 billion, Mr Prebble said.</p>
<p>“The government’s financial position has deteriorated $5.5 billion just in the past six months,” he said.</p>
<p>“The Budget tables show that borrowing by 2005 is predicted to increase by $5.5 billion over what was forecast in the December update, just six months ago. To the best of my knowledge, not one media commentator has reported this massive turnaround.”</p>
<p>Mr Prebble said research by American economists Gerald Scully and Dr Patrick Caragata had shown that raising the rate of tax did not result in any more tax revenue.</p>
<p>Professor Scully found that the New Zealand economy was already taxed beyond its ability to pay. A further tax increase would damage the producer sector, the economy’s growth would be reduced, and tax revenues would fall.</p>

<p>“The reason ACT calls for lower taxes is because a well-designed tax cut will boost the economy, create more jobs and prosperity, and a stronger economy will result in more tax revenue,” Mr Prebble said.</p>
<p>“The ACT party are not really tax cutters at all – they just want to cut the tax rates so they can get more tax revenue.”</p>
