<p><strong>Friday, 29 June 2001, 3:39 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is today applauding the decision of the Dunedin College of Education to accept the governments fee freeze offer for 2002, and is encouraging all other tertiary institutions to follow suit.</p>
<p>“This decision demonstrates what students have said all along, that though the deal is far from generous it is enough freeze fees,” said NZUSA Co-President Andrew Campbell.</p>
<p>“The bottom line for students has been that fees can’t go up. The fee burden is already too high and acts as a barrier to many people participating in tertiary education. This decision ensures that for some students at least the fee burden will not be any greater next year,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“The issue of tertiary funding is one the government has failed to adequately address. However using the threat of fee increases is not an acceptable way for tertiary institutions to make that point. In a year when funding is being increased for only the second time in a decade it is hard for institutions to justify such an aggressive fees stance,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“Students around the country must now ask the question if it’s good enough for Dunedin why is it not good enough for us? All tertiary institutions should follow this lead and freeze fees,” said Campbell.</p>
