<p>More Schools Should Copy Waikato and Reject NCEA</p>
<p>Saturday 12th May 2001 Donna Awatere Huata Media Release -- Education</p>
<p>ACT Education Spokesman MP Donna Awatere Huata today called on all principals to join Waikato&#39;s top secondary institutions and snub the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA).</p>
<p>&quot;I commend the principals of Hamilton Boys&#39; High School, Hillcrest High School, St Paul&#39;s Collegiate, St Peters High School of Cambridge and Waikato Diocesan School for their bravery in standing up for their pupils and rejecting the NCEA.</p>
<p>&quot;These schools hope to join Auckland Grammar and offer Cambridge University&#39;s international A level and IGCSEs (formerly O levels) in core subjects.</p>
<p>&quot;So far 24 schools have expressed interest in providing this qualification. The rest of New Zealand&#39;s principals need to follow suit and reject the NCEA. Otherwise, we will end up with an utterly unfair system with kids whose schools only offer the NCEA left behind.</p>
<p>&quot;The problems of the NCEA are going to be compounded by racist, elitist zoning restrictions. The schools rejecting the NCEA in Hamilton are wealthy, high-decile schools. Kids at Hamilton&#39;s poorer schools are going to suffer by not having the opportunity to receive an internationally recognised qualification.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government needs to listen to principals whose main concern is the education of their students, and start righting the wrongs,&quot; Donna Awatere Huata said.</p>
