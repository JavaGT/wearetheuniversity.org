<p>MORE FEE HYPOCRISY FROM WSU</p>
<p>The Waikato Students&#39; Union (WSU) support for the government&#39;s fee-freeze deal is hypocritical when the re-introduction this year of compulsory membership of WSU added over half a million dollars the annual cost of attending Waikato University, Student Choice spokesman Clint Heine said today. Heine said it was hypocritical for WSU co-president Mecina Stanbury to say students can&#39;t accept a tuition fee hike when she supports compulsory membership, a policy that has already imposed huge and unnecessary new costs on Waikato students.</p>
<p>&quot;The WSU is a political organisation that simply doesn&#39;t represent all students. This year WSU is budgeted to take over $550,000 off Waikato students. People who are struggling to pay other costs shouldn&#39;t be forced to join an unrepresentative political group before they can attend university,&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>
<p>Heine also said that at a meeting in November last year attended by less than 30 people, WSU raised its own 2001 fee by 40%. &quot;In less than an hour this meeting cost Waikato students an additional $165,000. If Mecina Stanbury is so opposed to fee increases she should act to reduce this additional burden on Waikato students,&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>
<p>&quot;Stanbury accused the government as treating students as cash cows, but it&#39;s obvious that student politicians see students in exactly the same way,&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>
