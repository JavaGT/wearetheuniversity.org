<p>Gerry Brownlee National Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>5 June 2001</p>
<p>Reassessment exposes inequities</p>
<p>The Minister of Education&#39;s &#39;Single Reassessment of Internal Assessments&#39; policy announced today shows again the glaring inequities for students who will study for the National Certificate for Educational Achievement next year, National&#39;s Education spokesperson Gerry Brownlee said today.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a laughable non-decision on behalf of the Minister. At the end of the day while a student may deserve the opportunity of reassessment they won&#39;t necessarily get it because the decision is left up to individual schools as to whether a student is eligible for reassessment.</p>
<p>&quot;The system is unfair because if a student doesn&#39;t make the grade the first time round, their school will decide whether they get a second shot but each school will have their own criteria. &quot;Leaving it up to schools to decide &#39;if more learning&#39; has taken place puts teachers in an invidious position and open to the allegation of personality issues between individual teachers and pupils influencing the reassessment decision.</p>
<p>&quot;With 90% of teachers recently surveyed saying they believed there will be minimal consistency in the way teachers mark internally assessed work next year, and the Minister&#39;s decision today, parents, teachers and students should be demanding much stronger moderation between schools and pupil&#39;s work than Mr Mallard seems willing to fund.</p>
<p>&quot;This reassessment policy is going to make the NCEA an even lower standard of qualification than it already is,&quot; Mr Brownlee said.</p>
