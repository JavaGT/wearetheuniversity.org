<p><strong>Tuesday, 23 January 2001, 10:46 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Report Calls On Government To Reduce Fees And Extend Allowances</p>
<p>A report by the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) which has called on the government to reduce tertiary education tuition fees, extend student allowances, provide a partial write off to students with loans who gain employment in New Zealand and to develop a strategy for the sector is being endorsed by the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>The report Our Children, The Priority for Policy urges the Government to review tax structures to better provide social services for children.</p>
<p>“The rising costs of tertiary education not only effects those participating in the sector, but also those excluded by them. It is an imperative that costs are reduced so that all New Zealanders have access to tertiary education regardless of their socio -economic background” said NZUSA Co President Andrew Campbell.</p>
<p>“The current tertiary sector is in such disarray that our country’s youth have very little to look forward to. The government needs to look closely at reducing fees and extending allowances to ensure that those most adverse to debt in society are not discriminated against”, said Campbell.</p>
<p>“NZUSA endorses the CPAG report and its recommendations. We call on the government to respond to the issues of child policy that it raises, while recognising that a holistic remedy needs to be applied to the problems identified in the report, including the role of an accessible tertiary education system in breaking poverty cycles”, said Campbell.</p>
<p>“A measure of a healthy society is the way in which it treats its weakest members. Higher education has an important role in curing New Zealand’s current illness”, said Campbell.</p>
