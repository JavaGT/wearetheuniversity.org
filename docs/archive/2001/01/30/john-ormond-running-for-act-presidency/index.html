<p><strong>Tuesday, 30 January 2001, 11:11 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>January 29th 2001</p>
<p>Long time Party Activist and board member John Ormond has announced this afternoon that he will be contesting the ACT Presidency as a result of the announcement that Sir Roger Douglas will be standing down from the ACT Presidency and the board.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT would not exist without Sir Roger¹s enormous contribution over the last 7 years. As a founding member of the party, I know first hand the contribution that he has made. I have been proud to work with him.&quot; Mr Ormond said that he has been asked by members up and down the country to stand, and as a result had agreed to do so.</p>
<p>&quot;I am confident about ACT’s future, and if I gain the confidence of the ACT membership, I look forward to working with the caucus and the board in the lead up to the next election&quot; said Mr Ormond. &quot; I am looking forward to the board election, and the task ahead of the board to build a bigger and better party&quot; said Mr Ormond.</p>
<p>Attached : Letter from John Ormond to party members announcing his candidacy.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
<p>I am writing to advise you that I am standing for ACT Party President and to ask you for your support.</p>
<p>First I want to record my appreciation for the efforts of our retiring President Sir Roger Douglas.</p>
<p>ACT would not exist without the drive and determination of Sir Roger.</p>
<p>His belief in the potential of New Zealanders to build a better nation by each of us building a better life will continue to guide us. In Government he showed us that through economic freedom each of us could be better off. In social policy too, he continues to show that the potential of the individual should never be sacrificed against the interests of continued state provision, simply to salve the conscience of those who think this is caring. New Zealand could do so much better in social policy if we trusted ourselves and not Governments.</p>

<p>Few New Zealanders in public life have challenged us and changed us as Sir Roger has ­ and few will continue to do so.</p>
<p>As ACT President I will ask Sir Roger Douglas and the Hon Derek Quigley to become our Co Founders and to take an honoured position in the Party, both men are in some senses bigger than ACT. Both must be free to advocate a personal vision for their Country.</p>
<p>The ACT Caucus will play its part in the major policy debates of this year with superannuation being foremost. Richard and his Team deserve our support at this critical time.</p>
<p>Like you I believe New Zealand is adrift. Successive Governments have decided that doing little in the way of policy is the recipe for re-election. Meanwhile the world passes us by and our young leave for overseas. New Zealand cannot prosper if we become a Pacific backwater.</p>
<p>Given this environment I am optimistic about ACT¹s future. For our values place us on the right side of history. All around the world collectivism in economic and social policy is failing. I think the tide will turn here as this Government squanders the opportunity it has. We must be ready to capitalise on this.</p>
<p>I want to see ACT provide positive leadership on the centre-right of the political spectrum. As ACT President I will continue to foster co-operation with National where we agree and constructive engagement where we differ. As the Party of ideas we can prompt and challenge National to move towards greater freedom and away from meddling managerialism.</p>
<p>Many New Zealanders share our common values of individual responsibility, freedom of choice, enterprise and initiative and where we can, we live by these values in our day-to-day lives. But because of the extensive involvement of government in New Zealand society many don¹t recognise these values as a coherent political philosophy. Many believe that if politicians provide a social service this is socially responsible. Conversely, private sector provision of the same services at a better quality is socially irresponsible.</p>
<p>The challenge for ACT is convince New Zealanders that the values that many live their lives by should also apply in public policy. Getting the right policy and then communicating that policy to New Zealand in a positive and enthusiastic manner will meet this challenge. I want to see this happen.</p>
<p>A good philosophy is worth working for. And here is where Party organisation matters. ACT has completed Ruth Richardson¹s Review. As a member of the Review Committee I am determined to implement her recommendations. I want to see a culture of activism and engagement. We must continue to recruit and retain New Zealanders that can make a contribution to Parliament. Our electorate organisations must be in shape to engage their communities regarding our values. ACT already draws on the talents and abilities of some remarkable New Zealanders. I know we can do better.</p>
<p>A good Party President is a team builder. We have some excellent Board candidates coming forward from each region. I want to knit them together so that their strengths and talents are put to work towards the tasks ahead. I also want to work closely with Caucus. As Party President my support will always be fulsome and public and any criticism on your behalf, constructive and private. I know how hard our Members of Parliament work ­ they have my confidence.</p>
<p>I will attend as many Board Candidate meetings around the Country as I can, simply because I believe in ACT and its place in our nation¹s political future. I also think it is important that the ACT Party President be available to Members. It is part of the job to be your sounding board ­ to hear your concerns, and to understand them even if I don¹t share them. I want you to know that you can contact me directly on any matter regarding your Party, not just during the Board elections but afterwards as well. I am always interested to hear how you see things.</p>
<p>The presence of ACT in Parliament represents the courage and conviction of many ordinary New Zealanders. As we continue to prosper in future Parliaments that success will be your success. I believe that ACT¹s strength is driven by the passion of its members and that the challenges we face are great but the opportunities are even greater.</p>
<p>With your support as ACT Party President I hope to play my part in ensuring that future success. With vigour and enthusiasm, with courage and commitment it¹s time to get to work.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>John Ormond For ACT Party President</p>
