<p><strong>Wednesday, 31 January 2001, 4:23 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Opposition Leader Jenny Shipley has today announced a significant reshuffle of portfolios for her MPs.</p>
<p>The attached list details the new portfolios for National&#39;s 39 MPs. Please note that the order in which MPs names are listed does not represent their rankings under the new portfolio allocations. The final rankings will only be known after the election of a new Deputy Leader and Junior Whip on the first day of National&#39;s three day caucus in Napier. Those rankings will be announced on that day, Wednesday February 7.</p>
<p>In terms of National&#39;s nine member front-bench Gerry Brownlee and Bob Simcock will be promoted to that group in the new rankings. They will fill vacancies on the front-bench created by the movement of Wyatt Creech and John Luxton to National&#39;s middle-bench.</p>
