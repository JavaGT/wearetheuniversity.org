<p><strong>Wednesday, 18 April 2001, 9:55 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Students will continue EUB campaign despite Alliance back track</p>
<p>“Students will continue to put pressure on the government to reinstate the Emergency Unemployment Benefit for all students who cannot find jobs over summer with or without the support of the Deputy Prime Minister,” said Sam Huggard, New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) Co-President.</p>
<p>The call came in response to today’s announcement by Jim Anderton that the Alliance will shift their focus from campaigning for the reinstatement of the EUB to looking at industry-government job creation options instead.</p>
<p>“Job creation has benefits for students - that’s why the national student associations set up Student Job Search. However the campaign to reinstate the EUB has always been about those students who fall through the gaps and cannot find a job. Under Mr Anderton’s scheme there will be students who miss out and the government is still doing nothing for them,” said Sam Huggard.</p>
<p>“We will consider any job creation scheme on its merits,” said Sam Huggard. “These schemes are complimentary to reinstating the EUB, not a solution in lieu of it. It is only fair if students cannot find jobs that they are treated the same as all other New Zealanders and are eligible for income support,” said Sam Huggard.</p>
<p>“We are disappointed that Labour has refused to include provision for the EUB in next months budget. This will mean that once again the country’s parents will be put in the ridiculous situation of having to support their adult children over summer,” said Sam Huggard</p>
