<p><strong>Friday, 27 April 2001, 1:16 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>A new research centre addressing the issues of accounting, governance and taxation has been formed at Victoria University.</p>
<p>The purpose of the centre for Accounting, Governance and Taxation Research is to advance and apply knowledge to the accounting and legal professions, commerce industry and the public sector through the development and application of both fundamental and applied research especially for issues which have the potential to impact on the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>The centre was established within Victoria&#39;s School of Accounting and Commercial Law and brings together researchers and accounting and legal professionals in ongoing discussion and exploration of issues, ideas and analysis. It aims to build strong links with commerce and industry, the public sector and the wider community.</p>
<p>The Director of the Centre is Professor Keitha Dunstan. She says the Centre aims to develop excellence in leading edge thinking on accounting, governance and taxation issues and to provide informed debate. A priority of the Centre will be to host eminent international research visitors. The generous sponsorship of PricewaterhouseCoopers (Wellington) will be used to fund the inaugural Visiting Researcher Fellowship to promote research in the area of Capital Gains Tax.</p>
<p>The Centre will also host a Research Workshop Series and a Business Links Seminar Series and will disseminate relevant research through its Working Paper Series.</p>
<p>The Centre&#39;s Advisory Board includes Victoria University Professors Neil Quigley, Don Trow, David White and Yvonne Van Roy as well as prominent representatives from the accountancy profession and the public sector.</p>
<p>The Centre for Accounting, Governance and Taxation Research is being launched at Rutherford House on Thursday May 3 from 5 pm and the media are invited to attend.  </p>
