<p><strong>Monday, 9 April 2001, 11:02 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Young_Nationals">New Zealand Young Nationals</a></strong></p>
<p>8 April 2001</p>
<p>Young Nationals have held a very successful annual conference in Wellington this weekend, with a high turnout and a good time had by all who attended.</p>
<p>&quot;We have set the scene for what will be a hugely important year for both Young Nationals and the National Party in terms of building a solid platform enabling us to succeed in 2002,&quot; said Young Nationals Chair Daniel Gordon.</p>
<p>&quot;On Thursday conference was addressed by Merepeka Raukawa-Tait, CEO of National Collective of Independent Women&#39;s Refuges, who delivered a powerful address about some of the key issues that young New Zealanders should be thinking about. It is very important to have speakers at our conference who will ensure that young people are challenged in their thinking,&quot; said Daniel Gordon.</p>
<p>Party Leader Jenny Shipley also spoke to the conference, highlighting the importance of young people getting out there and having a say about the issues of importance to them. &quot;Jenny is a huge fan of Young Nationals, and its fantastic to have her direct involvement in our conference,&quot; continued Daniel Gordon.</p>
<p>On Friday Young Nationals heard from Dr Graham Scott, former secretary to the Treasury, who addressed the conference on economic issues, and also from Dr David Dickens from the Centre for Strategic Studies at Victoria University, who discussed the importance of developing good defence and international relations policy.</p>
<p>The conference included a forum with Andrew Campbell, Co President of New Zealand University Students Association. &quot;It is healthy that our organisation can engage in dialogue with organisations that we may not necessarily always agree with, but can help us to develop policy by making us better informed on relevant issues,&quot; said Daniel Gordon.</p>

<p>Party President John Slater also addressed conference, as did Party Presidential Candidate Michelle Boag. Both stressed the importance of being involved in Young Nationals and pledged their full support for the organisation. It is interesting to note that both were former Young Nats themselves.</p>
<p>The conference has also been very lucky to have the presence of five international delegates from both the Young Liberal Movement and Young Nationals of Australia. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In summary, the conference has been hugely successful and has set the tone for a successful year ahead,&quot; concluded Daniel Gordon.</p>
