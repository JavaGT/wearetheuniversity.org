<p><strong>Monday, 9 April 2001, 9:40 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>8 April 2001</p>
<p>National will support the formation of Global-Co, the industry-driven choice for a New Zealand owned global food company.</p>
<p>&quot;The dairy industry is hugely important to the New Zealand economy. It is therefore important that there is broad political consensus around its future,&quot; Opposition Leader Jenny Shipley said in a joint statement with National&#39;s Agriculture spokesman Gavan Herlihy.</p>
<p>&quot;When in Government, we worked with the industry on the formation of a mega dairy company. The industry and the current Government have decided on an alternative approach.</p>
<p>&quot;Our initial concerns around the regulatory environment in which the company will operate have largely been resolved. Our decision to support the proposal came after extensive consultation with farmers, the industry and its officials. We have written to thousands of dairy farmers outlining our position, and we advised industry leaders and the Minister on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We look forward to continuing to work with the industry as the final details of the regulatory system are put in place.</p>
<p>&quot;This new entity will belong to the dairy farmers of New Zealand. Whilst change must be progressed through the parliamentary system, the final decision whether the proposal progresses lies with the soon to be conducted farmers&#39; vote,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>Ends</p>
