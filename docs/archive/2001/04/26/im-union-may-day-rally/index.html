<p><strong>Thursday, 26 April 2001, 11:34 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions">New Zealand Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p>An &quot;I&#39;m Union&quot; campaign will be launched at a Wellington Unions May Day rally in Cuba Mall at lunchtime on May Day, Tuesday May 1st</p>
<p>Pat Bolster, Secretary of the Wellington Affiliates Council of the NZCTU, sees the launch as being a celebratory occasion. &quot;There will be live music - the Brass Razoo Solidarity Band, and Choir Choir Pants on Fire: a few speakers, including NZCTU President, Ross Wilson and a sausage sizzle. May Day, the day when workers around the world celebrate common cause is especially important given that Globalisation is threatening rights at the workplace everywhere”, he said.</p>
<p>The &quot;I&#39;m Union&quot; campaign is designed to increase solidarity amongst workers in New Zealand workplaces. The first sign of this will be people wearing &quot;I’m Union&quot; stickers and thus able to easily recognise that colleagues are union members. Too frequently people are not aware that there are other union members in a workplace, when actually there are a large number. With the end of the Employment Contracts Act regime people need no longer feel isolated, afraid, and individualised. This campaign will help bring workers together.</p>
<p>The rally will start at 12:30 and run until 1:30, after which it is understood other groups wishing to celebrate May Day will take the stage.</p>
