<p>Revolutions and Revolutionary Murmurs: Fiji and Aotearoa New Zealand</p>
<p>Noted constitutional law expert Jock Brookfield is to give a public lecture on the Fiji constitutional crisis at The University of Auckland on Tuesday 1 May.</p>
<p>His lecture “Revolutions and Revolutionary Murmurs: Fiji and Aotearoa New Zealand” follows on from his prize-winning book &quot;Waitangi and Indigenous Rights: Revolution, Law and Legitimation&quot; (Auckland University Press; 1999), which deals with how the revolutionary taking of power by one people over another can be legitimated.</p>
<p>In his lecture he will look in particular at: (i) the recent case of Fiji v Prasad (where the Fiji Court of Appeal held that the interim civilian government, established by the Military Commander, had not become lawful); and</p>
<p>(ii) constitutional developments since the judgment.</p>
<p>Professor Brookfield will also consider the implications of the crisis for Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>Professor Brookfield is a noted legal author, commentator and Professor Emeritus of The University of Auckland who taught for 27 years in the areas of constitutional law, land law and conveyancing. He has a special interest in the role of law in revolutionary constitutional changes and the factors that legitimate them.</p>
<p>The lecture will take place in the Stone Lecture Theatre, Eden Crescent, The University of Auckland, from 1 to 3pm on Tuesday 1 May.</p>
