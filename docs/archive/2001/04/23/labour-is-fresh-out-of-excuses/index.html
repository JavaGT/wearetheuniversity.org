<p>Labour is Fresh Out of Excuses</p>
<p>Penny Webster Media Release -- Other</p>
<p>“Six thousand, nine hundred and two people can not be ignored,” ACT Immigration Spokesman MP Penny Webster said today.</p>
<p>“Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel has run out of excuses and her Government must accept responsibility for the exodus of New Zealand’s talented people,” Penny Webster said.</p>
<p>“Ms Dalziel’s excuse that last month’s record-breaking figures were a ‘blip’ has been proved wrong. The net loss of skilled people in the year ending in March was 6,902 – only a statistically slight 54 different to February’s record-breaking figure. It is the second-biggest year-ending month ever. In fact, more skilled people departed in March than in February.</p>
<p>“After months of bluster, Ms Dalziel’s Government has simply run out of other people to blame.</p>
<p>“When the record January figures were released – which were then exceeded by the record-setting February year-ended figures – Ms Dalziel blamed them on the ‘recent announcement of a new social security agreement with Australia.’ That was buck passing. The flawed social security agreement wasn’t made widely public until February 26.</p>
<p>“She next blamed the media for speculation on the future of Trans-Tasman travel arrangements. On March 21, she said the media had created a ‘climate of uncertainty’.</p>
<p>“Now she has run out of people to blame. The bluster and bravado has ended, and the facts tell the true story.</p>
<p>“This Government is not producing growth in living standards. Alliance and Labour have done nothing to encourage New Zealanders to be innovative or entrepreneurial at home. So thousands and thousands of our youngest and our best now see their future overseas,” Penny Webster said.</p>
