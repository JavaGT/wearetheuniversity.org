<p>Jenny Shipley Leader of the Opposition John Slater National Party President</p>

<p>National&#39;s policy taskforce provokes debate</p>
<p>Taskforces launched by the National Party after the last election are provoking lively debate on some major policy issues, Opposition Leader Jenny Shipley said today.</p>
<p>&quot;After our General Election defeat the President John Slater and I established three major policy taskforces - Seniors and Superannuation, Constitutional Issues, and Tertiary and Youth Policy.</p>
<p>The discussion documents on the first two topics can be viewed at <a href="http://www.national.org.nz">www.national.org.nz</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;They were invited to explore, research and then recommend issues of interest to National and of importance to New Zealand for discussion.</p>
<p>&quot;The taskforce on Constitutional Issues is currently being discussed by the party.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of these issues are sensitive and challenging:- the future of the Monarchy in New Zealand, our electoral system and the future of Maori seats.</p>
<p>&quot;They are also issues on the minds of many New Zealanders. National has always been willing to explore and lead on complex issues. Today is no exception, &quot; Mrs Shipley said.</p>
<p>&quot;The taskforce report is not policy. We are delighted that it will form the basis for discussion from which policy may emerge,&quot; Mrs Shipley and Mr Slater said.</p>
<p>&quot;Members have been invited to endorse, amend, or reject the recommendations.</p>
<p>&quot;We look forward to these issues being debated at our conferences, the first of which begins in Rotorua on April 27,&quot; they said.</p>
