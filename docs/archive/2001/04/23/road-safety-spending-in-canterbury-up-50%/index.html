<p>Road Safety Spending in Canterbury Up 50%</p>
<p>&quot;Over the past year the Government boosted the amount spent on community road safety projects in Canterbury by 50%,&quot; Waimakariri Member of Parliament Clayton Cosgrove announced today.</p>
<p>&quot;The government spent more than $688,000.00 on community road safety projects in the Canterbury region over the past year, which is a boost of more than $342,500.00,&quot; Mr Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>&quot;The previous Government froze road safety education spending for six long years – we scrapped this. Last year we demonstrated our commitment to saving lives by nearly doubling the total spent on community road safety initiatives.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are spending $3 million more each year on community road safety initiatives.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are committed to curbing the road toll and saving lives. We believe the way to reduce road trauma is a multi-pronged approach, which must include education – something the previous Government failed to invest in. We need to educate drivers to change their attitudes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our government is working on all fronts to make our roads safer for all New Zealanders. &quot;</p>
<p>The amount distributed recognises both the population mix and road safety risk in each area.</p>
<p>&quot;Community road safety workers need to be congratulated for the work they do in our communities to make our roads safer for all users.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Over the years, tens of thousands of New Zealanders have been maimed and killed on our roads: 2,667 lives have been lost since 1996. In 1999 the fiscal impact of this carnage amounted to $3.1 billion with property damage alone totaling nearly $400 million.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;However the price paid by those left behind is immeasurable. Between 1996 and 2000, 277 motorists, passengers and pedestrians were killed Canterbury roads: that&#39;s 277 mums and dads, sons and daughters who never made it home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to urge all of us to think carefully each time we get behind the wheel and to drive to survive.&quot; Mr Cosgrove said</p>
