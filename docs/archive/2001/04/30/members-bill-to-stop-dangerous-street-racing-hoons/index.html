<p><strong>Monday, 30 April 2001, 1:10 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>COSGROVE TO PROMOTE A MEMBERS BILL TO STOP DANGEROUS STREET RACING HOONS</p>
<p>Clayton Cosgrove Labour MP for Waimakariri today announced plans to promote a members bill to stop illegal street burn out car racing.</p>
<p>“I am sick of these burn out racers tearing up our streets and endangering the lives of law abiding Kiwis,” Mr Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“I have spoken to police and members of the community who are very concerned that these hoons are going to injure or kill someone with their out of control behaviour. These hoons don’t seem to care who gets in the way of their so called “fun” not to mention the damage they cause to our streets and private property at a cost of hundreds and thousands of dollars.”</p>
<p>“The police report that fining these burn out racers does nothing as they don’t pay their fines and the community around the country want something done to stop this sort of loutish behaviour happening on our streets late at night,” Mr Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“The members bill I intend to take to my caucus is based on a New South Wales model. The bill has two parts: the first time these hoons are caught their cars will be impounded for 3 months, and if they are caught a second time their cars will be impounded and then sold,” Mr Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“I have spoken to the Police and the Police Minister Hon George Hawkins about this issue and they are very supportive of the proposal as the illegal pouring of diesel on public roads and then burning it up in a car is dangerous, destructive and down right stupid.”</p>

<p>“Law abiding Kiwis have had enough of this ridiculous behaviour and they want something done about it. I believe this is a common sense approach that will provide a costly deterrent to these street racers,” Mr Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>Mr Cosgrove is now in the process of drawing up a bill which he will place before the Labour caucus to seek approval before it is placed in the parliamentary ballot.</p>
