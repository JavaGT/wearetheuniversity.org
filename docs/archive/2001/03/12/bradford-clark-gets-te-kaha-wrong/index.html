<p>Clark gets Te Kaha wrong</p>
<p>Prime Minister Helen Clark is wrongly claiming the frigate Te Kaha required extensive refurbishment on its Southern Ocean mission to detract Patagonian toothfish poachers, National&#39;s Defence spokesperson Max Bradford said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly Helen Clark is so badly advised on defence issues she can&#39;t even get the facts correct.</p>
<p>&quot;The ship was repaired at Thames, not the Devonport naval dockyards as she claimed. It did not require dry-docking.</p>
<p>&quot;Te Kaha was hit by a massive 19 metre wave. The only damage was the loss of a capstan controller on the foredeck, two upper deck power points and two outside speakers. It cost $21,130, half paid for by the shipbuilder, Tenix.</p>
<p>&quot;In an effort to support her justification not to replace frigate HMNZS Canterbury with a frigate, Clark said Te Kaha wasn&#39;t designed for resource protection and &#39;found the sea difficult to handle&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Te Kaha actually performed extremely well and navy experts acknowledged that similar vessels wouldn&#39;t have handled the rough ocean as well, and would have sustained more damage,&quot; Mr Bradford said.</p>
