<p><strong>Wednesday, 28 March 2001, 3:00 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT education spokesman Donna Awatere Huata today said today that a record 2210 primary and early childhood school teachers had left New Zealand in the past twelve months to February this year.</p>
<p>“I’m very concerned. While the Minister claims there are low teacher vacancy rates currently it does not mean we can be complacent, especially with figures like this.</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly, should such a rate continue upwards the impact on teacher vacancies and the quality of education delivered to our children will be negatively affected.</p>
<p>“It is no surprise there is an increase in the number of teachers leaving the country - considering teachers no longer have the incentive to achieve with the removal of bulk funding and school zoning plus an academic framework where success is not rewarded.</p>
<p>“The Minister may well be right in the short term that vacancies are low simply as a reaction to not only skilled people leaving the country but also their young children leaving with them,” said Mrs Huata.</p>
