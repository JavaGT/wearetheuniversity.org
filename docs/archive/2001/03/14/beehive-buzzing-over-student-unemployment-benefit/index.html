<p><strong>Wednesday, 14 March 2001, 2:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>“The credibility of the Labour Party as leaders of the Government is on the line as pressure mounts both inside and outside its ranks over the restoration of the Emergency Unemployment Benefit (EUB) for students during the summer period,” said Andrew Campbell Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>Students around the country are today protesting against Labours refusal to reinstate the EUB in this term of government.</p>
<p>“We are encouraged by the Greens’ announcement of their budget bid for the reinstatement of the EUB. The Alliance has already made a budget bid for the EUB within Government and New Zealand First also supports the move. Labour is becoming seriously isolated from its supporters in Parliament on this issue,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“It is disappointing for students who voted Labour into power to be abandoned on this issue. Financial assistance when unemployed is a fundamental right which students are currently denied. We simply cannot understand why Labour is treating students so differently from all other New Zealanders,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>The EUB was cut by the National Government in 1998. Two thirds of students are now ineligible for any form of financial assistance if unemployed over the summer period. At that time Steve Maharey pledged to restore the EUB if elected into government</p>
<p>“NZUSA is asking Maharey for answers on the EUB, not spin. He also needs to front up to the Alliance, the Greens, New Zealand First and students as to why he thinks unemployed students should be denied access to this benefit” said Campbell.</p>
