<p><strong>Thursday, 29 March 2001, 1:57 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University">Massey University</a></strong></p>
<p>Total student numbers at Massey University are up for the first semester.</p>
<p>The biggest growth is again at the University’s Albany campus where total intake for this year is up by 16 per cent and first year enrolments by 13 per cent. There has also been a significant increase in first year enrolments of more than 14 per cent, for the University’s extramural programmes.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor James McWha says the University’s enrolments for the 2001 academic year appear to signal some changes in student study patterns. “Although overall, the headcount is up there has been a comparative decline in EFTS (equivalent student numbers). This suggests that more students are studying part-time, possibly reflecting the impact of reduced funding, higher fees and student loan commitments.</p>
<p>“The increase in first year extramural students is welcome as a further recognition of the value of lifelong learning and the greater accessibility provided by new technology. We are also delighted that our Albany campus, supported by the strengths of the whole University, continues to be recognised as a unique and excellent study venue in a particularly competitive market.”</p>
<p>As expected, there has been a further decline in internal enrolments at the University’s Palmerston North campus. Professor McWha says the decline – of 3.7 per cent in EFTS – is not as significant as in the previous three years. But inevitably those earlier falls inevitably have a pipeline effect on this year’s second and third year enrolments. “However the Palmerston North campus has great strengths, in teaching, as the University’s research engine room, the centre for extramural delivery and as s superb study environment. I believe it has a strong future.”</p>

<p>The Vice-Chancellor says the University is focusing its attention on increasing numbers at Palmerston North, working with academic and other staff. “We need to identify our areas of strength and build on them.</p>
<p>Wellington Principal Bruce Phillipps says the Wellington campus is experiencing solid growth in university programmes this year, following the phasing out of some courses.</p>
<p>“At the end of last year there were 3610 full time equivalent students (EFTS). That total was reduced by four percent as the university closed trades courses in carpentry, automotive, and other certificate-level courses.</p>
<p>“From that new base, our enrolments are approximately four to five percent up,” says Mr Phillipps. Programmes showing most growth are in the College of Business and the College of Design, Fine Arts and Music. “The range of options now available in business is clearly attractive to our students, and the new Bachelor of Fine Arts has also been very well received.”</p>
