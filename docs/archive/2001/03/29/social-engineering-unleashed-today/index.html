<p><strong>Thursday, 29 March 2001, 4:39 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National today strongly opposed the final step in passing the Government&#39;s Property (Relationships) Amendment Bill into law.</p>
<p>&quot;This Bill is social engineering and political correctness gone mad. We would not wish it on any couple in New Zealand whether they are a married, de facto or same sex couple,&quot; National MP Tony Ryall said in the debate today.</p>
<p>&quot;This Bill leaves it up to judges to decide the division of assets on a case by case basis. There will be no certainty and different judges will produce different rulings.</p>
<p>&quot;Judges will be required to predict future earnings when assessing the appropriate split of assets. What if they get it wrong?</p>
<p>&quot;More cases will go to court. Lawyers predict 75-80% of relationship break-ups will go before the courts compared with only 10% now. The family courts are already clogged. Judges advise that at least six new judges will be required to cope with the increased workload.</p>
<p>&quot;Loose definitions in key parts of the legislation mean courts will be making rules that Parliament should have made.</p>
<p>&quot;But the worst con perpetrated by this legislation is in contracting out. Family lawyers say this will cost at least $1,000 per partner. The Government&#39;s answer is a quick and cheap form which won&#39;t be worth the paper it&#39;s written on.</p>
<p>&quot;Many de facto partners won&#39;t agree to opt out of the legislation. This is unfair on the partner who wants to protect their assets. It will affect elderly widows or widowers who enter a de facto relationship for companionship when their husband or wife passes away, or divorcees with assets from a previous relationship.</p>

<p>&quot;The Government is proposing to spend only $200,000 on publicity for the changes, compared to the over $1.2 million it spent on the Employment Relations Bill. This Bill affects 236,000 New Zealanders in de facto relationships and hundreds of thousands in marriages and they have a right to know about it.</p>
<p>&quot;This Bill will have the unintended consequence of financially marrying every de facto couple in New Zealand,&quot; Mr Ryall said.</p>
