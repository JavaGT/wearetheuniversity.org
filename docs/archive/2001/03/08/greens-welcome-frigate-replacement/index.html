<p>Greens Welcome Patrol Craft Replacement For Frigate</p>
<p>Green MP Keith Locke has welcomed government moves to replace the frigate Canterbury with patrol craft.</p>
<p>&quot;Patrol boats will be much cheaper to run and will be more relevant to New Zealand&#39;s real security challenges which lie with illegal fishing, drug smuggling, and environmental disasters,&quot; said Mr Locke, the party&#39;s defence spokesperson.</p>
<p>&quot;We don&#39;t need the expensive weaponry the frigates have, and these boats tend to spend too much time overseas on military exercises.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Locke said he was pleased the Prime Minister had also rejected any anti-submarine capability for the Orions.</p>
<p>&quot;Project Sirius, which was geared to submarine detection, would have been a $568 million waste of money. I believe New Zealand should look seriously at civilian aircraft doing much of the maritime work. The Orions only do three percent of Australia&#39;s economic zone surveillance. The rest is done by the Customs&#39; Dash-8 aircraft,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;National is circulating horror story&#39;s about the likely Australian response to these decisions. Surely, it is in Australia&#39;s interest for New Zealand to have a more relevant defence force, which can better handle peacekeeping and maritime surveillance work.</p>
<p>&quot;Not proceeding with another frigate, phasing out the Skyhawks, and cancelling Project Sirius will free up a great deal of money for more appropriate and relevent defence spending,&quot; he said.</p>
