<p><strong>Thursday, 22 March 2001, 10:58 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Victoria University enrolments are at an all-time high with record numbers of students enrolling.</p>
<p>The number of students enrolled after the second week of lectures was 12,760. &quot;This is more than in any first trimester in our 102 year history,&quot; said Victoria University Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stuart McCutcheon.</p>
<p>&quot;So far we are experiencing a growth in student numbers of 7.9%, and an overall increase of 6.6% in equivalent fulltime student numbers,&quot; said the Vice-Chancellor.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a major vote of confidence in Victoria University,&quot; said Professor McCutcheon. &quot;Students are obviously aware of our strong programmes, the calibre of our staff, and the benefits of living in New Zealand&#39;s top town.&quot;</p>
<p>All areas of the University have experienced growth in fulltime students. Architecture and Design is up 19%, followed by Law at 13%, Science 7%, Commerce and Administration 6%, with Humanities and Social Sciences increasing by 3%.</p>
<p>&quot;We are also seeing heavy demand for our new hostel facilities in the city,&quot; Professor McCutcheon said.</p>
<p>The rise in enrolment has the potential to increase income by around 5%. &quot;This is good news for Victoria University as any increase in revenue will offset the overall decline in University funding,&quot; said Professor McCutcheon. &quot;This decline is due to the freeze on student fees and the net reduction in real terms of the Government&#39;s contribution.&quot;</p>
<p>Wellington was also benefiting from the greater number of Victoria University students as they contribute significantly to the City&#39;s diverse and vibrant culture, he said.  </p>
