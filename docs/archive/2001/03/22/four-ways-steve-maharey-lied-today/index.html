<p>MEDIA RELEASE<br>22 March 2001<br>For immediate release</p>
<p>Four Ways Steve Maharey Lied Today</p>
<p>The Minister of Tertiary Education has made statements that deliberately attempt to mislead debate over the Emergency Unemployment Benefit (EUB) according to Otago University Students’ Association President Ayesha Verrall.</p>
<p>“Mr Maharey’s statements on summer benefits for students are blatant attempts to confuse the issue of the Emergency Unemployment Benefit because his position is illogical and indefensible,” said Ms Verrall.</p>
<p>“He argues that there is no need for the EUB and cites 1, 985 applications for special hardship benefits as evidence. The evidence of student hardship is starring him in the face,” said Ms Verrall.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, his suggestion that the student summer job market is buoyant only reinforces our point that the EUB won’t cost the taxpayer much. Student’s aren’t asking for more than the same safety net every other citizen has if they can’t find work.”</p>
<p>Mr Maharey also argued that because Labour electorate offices have few complaints therefore there was no problem. Ms Verrall responds, “Students don’t go to a politician when they’re hungry – they go to foodbanks, church groups and get into further debt.”</p>
<p>“It is true that the delivery of benefits to students has improved and Mr Maharey deserves credit for that. However he has attempted to confuse the improved service from Department of Work and Income with increased eligibility – something which doesn’t exist.” ENDS</p>
