<p><strong>Thursday, 22 March 2001, 4:50 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand Qualifications Authority is on the mark with its work on the National Certificate of Educational Achievement, National&#39;s Education spokesman Gerry Brownlee said today.</p>
<p>The NZQA appeared before the Education Select Committee this morning and were questioned by Mr Brownlee on their views about the NCEA.</p>
<p>&quot;The NZQA appear to have similar concerns to National about marks and moderation and have been doing some good work to address those concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;NZQA propose that reports show a students ranking in a graphic form so the student, their parents, potential employers and tertiary institutions will have some idea where they rank in relation to other students.</p>
<p>&quot;NZQA also addressed another major concern of National&#39;s - moderation. They propose that moderation be undertaken in the year of study, not retrospectively. This makes sense and would be a lot fairer to students.</p>
<p>&quot;NZQA want external assessment to be used more predominantly in some subjects. This is also a positive step.</p>
<p>&quot;National has outlined its concerns in a letter to the Minister. He should note that the NZQA shares those concerns and he should now swallow his pride and engage with us in a constructive dialogue. We must ensure that next year&#39;s fifth formers will be studying towards a viable and credible qualification,&quot; Mr Brownlee said.</p>
