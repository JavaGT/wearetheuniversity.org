<p><strong>Thursday, 22 March 2001, 10:30 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National is encouraged by Education Minister Trevor Mallard&#39;s concession that marks as well as grades will now be given to fifth form students when studying for the National Certificate of Educational Achievement from next year, National&#39;s Education spokesperson Gerry Brownlee said today.</p>
<p>&quot;We have scored a major breakthrough which I hope now means we can discuss our remaining concerns about the NCEA.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard&#39;s original plans to impose a dumbed down grading system in the NCEA would have jeopardised the value of the secondary school qualifications being sought by young New Zealanders from next year.</p>
<p>&quot;There will still be a vast range of abilities within the three achievement grades of credit, merit and excellence. Marks will help students know when they need to work a bit harder and will allow parents to see progress.</p>
<p>&quot;We remain very concerned that Mr Mallard&#39;s proposed NCEA has very low credibility in the wider community and will not be viable in the long term. This morning I wrote to Mr Mallard outlining our concerns and asking if these can be accommodated.</p>
<p>&quot;It is critically important that the two major parties agree on the shape and implementation of future secondary school qualifications. Mr Mallard should not drag his feet. He must arrange a purposeful dialogue, with the opposition having equal access to departmental officials.</p>
<p>&quot;If Mr Mallard accepts our concerns then progress toward certainty for young New Zealanders and their parents in our qualifications system will be closer,&quot; Mr Brownlee said.</p>
