<p>Switch beer loyalty to Miners says Nat MP</p>
<p>National&#39;s West Coast caretaker MP Nick Smith today visited Miners Brewery in Westport and says Coasters should switch their beer drinking loyalty to the only local product, Miners, if Dominion Breweries won&#39;t reconsider their decision to brew Monteith&#39;s in Auckland.</p>
<p>&quot;I call on West Coasters and ex-pat West Coasters to vote with their palate.</p>
<p>&quot;DB have exploited the heritage and character of the West Coast to market Monteith&#39;s and have made a serious error in now turning their back on the Coast.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this is a huge marketing blunder. The very reason Monteith&#39;s is so popular is because it is enables tens of thousands of New Zealanders with West Coast ancestry to maintain the link with the region through their choice of beer.</p>
<p>&quot;The loss of customer loyalty will cost DB more than any gain it will make from cheaper processing.</p>
<p>&quot;The 14 jobs lost in Greymouth is a serious blow to the West Coast, but to Auckland the gain is just a drop in the bucket. West Coasters need to send a strong message to DB by changing their beer drinking habits.</p>
<p>&quot;I call on DB to reconsider their decision. This is a cruel blow to the people of the West Coast who feel passionate about their beer and their local product,&quot; Dr Smith said.</p>
