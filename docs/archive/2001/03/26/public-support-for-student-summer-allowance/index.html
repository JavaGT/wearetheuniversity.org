<p><strong>Monday, 26 March 2001, 8:47 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Poll shows overwhelming public support for student summer allowance</p>
<p>Nearly three quarters (73%) of all New Zealanders believe that all students should be entitled to financial assistance over summer if they can’t find a job, according to a Colmar Brunton public opinion survey commissioned by the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) and the Aotearoa Tertiary Students’ Association (ATSA).</p>
<p>The survey results were released today as part of a national campaign calling on the Government to reinstate the Emergency Unemployment Benefit (EUB) in its upcoming budget. The EUB was cut by the National Government in 1998, an action which was criticised widely by the Labour Party at the time.</p>
<p>“If the government is not convinced by the calls made by students for the reinstatement of the EUB, then it should at least listen to the opinions of the electorate, especially the 78% of Labour voters that agree students should receive unemployment assistance over summer”, said NZUSA Co-President, Andrew Campbell.</p>
<p>“This poll shows overwhelming support across the board for the EUB. The government is discriminating against students by making them ineligible for financial assistance when unemployed. The people who brought the government to power have recognised this, and the government now needs to listen and respond to those people”, said ATSA President Keith Clark.</p>
<p>“The removal of the EUB has caused unnecessary hardship, forcing student associations to open food banks. This is an issue of fairness that goes beyond political affiliations,” said Campbell. “This is demonstrated by the fact that 65.9% of National voters support reinstating the EUB.”</p>
<p>“Steve Maharey said he would reinstate the EUB if Labour was elected into Government. The vast majority of New Zealanders want him to deliver on that promise in the upcoming government budget,” said Campbell.<br>ENDS<br>For further information<br>Andrew Campbell, NZUSA Co-President Keith Clark, ATSA President<br>Cell: 025 86 86 77 Cell: 025 756 526  </p>
