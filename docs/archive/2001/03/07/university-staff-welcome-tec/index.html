<p><img src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE"><br>The recommendation from the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission that the Government should move to establish a permanent body to be responsible for the co-ordination of tertiary education in New Zealand was welcomed today by university staff.</p>
<p>The National President of the Association of University Staff, Neville Blampied, said in Wellington today that the move to establish a permanent autonomous Tertiary Education Commission was warmly welcomed as this had been on the Association’s lobbying agenda since the abolition of the University Grants Committee in 1990.</p>
<p>While expressing support for the general direction of the TEAC report, Mr Blampied expressed concern at the likely timetable for implementation of the recommendation to establish a permanent commission.</p>
<p>“We are unlikely to see any realistic improvement in overall funding levels until academic year 2003. For a system in crisis this is intolerable.</p>
<p>“The time for the Government to rely on the three Rs – Rhetoric, Reviews and Reports – is at an end. If the Government is to advance its vision of New Zealand becoming a knowledge society and innovation-based economy then three Cs are required – courage, commitment and cash – and the most important right now is cash”, he said.</p>
