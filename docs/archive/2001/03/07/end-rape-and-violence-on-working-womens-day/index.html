<p>End Rape And Violence On International Working Women&#39;s Day</p>
<p>NZUSA is calling on all university women to wear black on Thursday 8 March (International Working Women&#39;s Day) and demand a world without rape and violence.</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA) has co-ordinated a national campaign for International Working Womens Day in conjunction with local campuses. The campaign involves t-shirts, badges, posters and stickers emblazoned with the message &quot;Thursdays in Black: demanding a world without rape and violence&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Demanding a world without rape and violence starts in your local community.&quot; NZUSA National Women&#39;s Rights Officer Dayna Berghan said. &quot;Thursdays in Black was started by the Mothers for the Disappeared in Argentina and is very relevant on International Working Women&#39;s Day.&quot;</p>
<p>Activities on campuses celebrating International Working Women&#39;s Day and stalls for Thursdays in Black are planned in Auckland University, Waikato University, Massey Albany, Massey Palmerston North, Victoria University, Lincoln University and Otago University.</p>
<p>&quot;The t-shirts sell for $25 and five dollars raised from each t-shirt goes to support local anti-violence and rape support groups. It&#39;s not charity - its positive action&quot; said Ms Berghan. &quot;By making a visible stand in our local community on Thursdays we raise awareness nationally.&quot;</p>
<p>For details of activities taking place at your local university campus please contact the Students&#39; Association of that university and ask to speak to the Women&#39;s Rights Officer.<br>ENDS<br>Contact:<br>Dayna Berghan (NZUSA National Women&#39;s Rights Officer)<br>Wk: 04 498 2500<br>Cell: (025) 991 867  </p>
