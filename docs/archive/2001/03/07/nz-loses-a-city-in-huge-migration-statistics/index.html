<p>New Zealand Loses A City In Huge Migration Statistics</p>
<p>New Zealand has lost the equivalent of a city in the past year, in the worst migration statistics seen for the country in 21 years, National&#39;s Immigration spokesperson Marie Hasler said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The loss of 75,841 people either long-term or permanently is huge. It&#39;s like losing the population of Palmerston North or Tauranga in one year.</p>
<p>&quot;The statistics show 11,780, or 30.5 percent, more people left permanently or long term than entered in the 12 months ending January.</p>
<p>&quot;What is alarming is that the figures top February&#39;s record statistics which showed massive increases in the number of skilled workers leaving and New Zealanders leaving for good.</p>
<p>&quot;The 1999 call by Jim Anderton for New Zealanders to return home hasn&#39;t worked. His call has been answered by thousands more Kiwis leaving in droves.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand can&#39;t afford to wave 17,290 skilled workers goodbye in one year while fewer skilled enter the country. Only 12,062 skilled entered the country meaning the net loss of skilled workers almost doubled to 5,228.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the coalition Government in December 1999 skilled departures have increased 12.3 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It shows that the brain drain is worse than ever and this Government is doing nothing to address it,&quot; Ms Hasler said.</p>
