<p><strong>Thursday, 15 March 2001, 2:07 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Otago Students burnt the ministerial directive that removed the Emergency Unemployment Benefit (EUB) for students in Dunedin’s Octagon today. This action followed a campus rally and a loud march down George St.</p>
<p>“Otago students are incensed by a policy that removes their basic human rights. Every other New Zealander is protected if they lose their job – why not students?” argued Otago University Students’ Association President Ayesha Verrall.</p>
<p>“It has been a successful day and student action has highlighted the issue. The Alliance, Greens and New Zealand First have all taken this opportunity to show their support for the EUB and students have given Labour something to think about”, said Ms Verrall.</p>
<p>“When Rodger Sowry issued the directive to remove the EUB Steve Maharey called it a ‘mean spirited attack on students’. However, since Maharey has been elected he has refused to address the issue,” said Ms Verrall.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is now on notice, they need to address this before students march in protest or march to foodbanks again. OUSA demands they restore the EUB,” said Ayesha Verrall.</p>
<p>Comedian Raybon Kan addressed the students in the Octagon where he supported the demand for the Emergency Benefit, “It’s for an emergency. If you dialed 111 in an Emergency they wouldn’t ask – ‘are you a student’?”</p>
<p>The March was part of a national day of action on the Emergency Unemployment Benefit.</p>
