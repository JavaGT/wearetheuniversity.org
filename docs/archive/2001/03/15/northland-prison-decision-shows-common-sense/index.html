<p><strong>Thursday, 15 March 2001, 4:52 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT Northland-based MP Dr Muriel Newman says the Northland Regional Council’s decision to decline resource consent for a new prison on the Ngawha site is a victory for common sense.</p>
<p>“I just hope the Corrections Department now shows some common sense of its own and changes its mind on appealing this decision. It has already spent $1.7 million of taxpayers’ money on buying this inappropriate site. Surely it would make no sense to waste a further several hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of taxpayers money on an appeal which is unlikely to succeed.</p>
<p>“The process in which the site was chosen still needs investigating. Due process was not followed. It is quite crazy to even think of building a prison on a geothermal fault line.</p>
<p>“It is misguided to locate a prison next to a geothermal valley which has the potential to become a major tourist attraction for the Northland region.</p>
<p>“In addition it was an outrage that the estimated cost of the new prison should have risen to $100 million from the original $40 million.</p>
<p>“I call on the Government to say enough is enough and put an end to this whole debacle now,” Dr Newman said.</p>
