<p><strong>Thursday, 29 November 2001, 9:18 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Government&#39;s arbitrary decision to only reimburse costs for those cancer patients who started treatment in Australia on or after September 6, is proving unfair with some cancer patients missing out, National&#39;s Health spokesperson Roger Sowry said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday in Parliament I mentioned a patient who left New Zealand in November and began her treatment on November 13 in Australia. Her family has been told by the Waikato District Health Board that it can&#39;t reimburse her and its hands are tied because she began treatment after November 6.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite its promises the Government is not giving district health boards defined criteria for its ad hoc reimbursement scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to be the case of only those who shout the longest and loudest are eligible for reimbursement for treatment in Australia. That means if you don&#39;t contact the media or the Opposition Health spokesperson you won&#39;t get reimbursed for treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not fair to cancer patients and their families who are already suffering and under stress. It is simply unjust.</p>
<p>&quot;The cancer patient I referred to in Parliament has been told she could not be reimbursed because she was not a district health board referral. She was not a referral because she organised her treatment before the Government decided to fund radiation treatment in Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;Speaking on behalf of the Minister of Health Dr Cullen asked me to refer the case to the Health Minister&#39;s office. I am very concerned that there are other patients out there who are not being reimbursed, and are not being treated fairly because they are not complaining.</p>
<p>&quot;I have written to the Minster today asking that the Minister reimburse this patient&#39;s travel and radiation treatment costs, and I am inviting other patients needing help to contact me,&quot; Mr Sowry said.</p>
