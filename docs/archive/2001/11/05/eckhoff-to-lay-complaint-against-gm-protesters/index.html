<p>Eckhoff to Lay Complaint Against GM Protesters</p>
<p>Monday 5 Nov 2001 Gerry Eckhoff Press Releases -- Environment &amp; Conservation</p>
<p>ACT Environment Spokesman Gerry Eckhoff will tomorrow seek to lay a complaint against self-declared anti-GM protesters Logan Petley, Tremane Barr, Steve Abel and Kara Vandeleur.</p>
<p>Mr Eckhoff will be attending the Wellington Central Police Station (corner Victoria and Harris Streets) at 9am tomorrow to lay the complaint.</p>
<p>&quot;The people I&#39;ll be laying complaints against have all made statements through the media in the past week supportive of ripping up GM plants. Mr Barr, for example was quoted in Christchurch newspaer The Press as saying: `We took a vote and decided that one of the strategies we would use was non-violent civil disobedience and the destruction of GE field trials.&#39; Other activists have been shown on television demonstrating how plants can be ripped up.</p>
<p>&quot;I consider these activities both incitement and conspiracy to break the law. This can only be viewed as eco-terrorism.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever spin these people want to put on their actions, they are indicating that they will undertake criminal activity and they are energetically encouraging others to do likewise.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not on. Those planning GM trials have been extremely patient. They undertook a voluntary moratorium. They took part in the Royal Commission the Greens called for. Now they must be protected against the wilful destruction that some extremists are planning.</p>

<p>&quot;Painstaking research has been carried out over a long period of time. Millions of dollars worth of physical and intellectual property are at risk in these trials. These trials stand to benefit all New Zealanders. ACT firmly believes in upholding law and order and we will be doing all we can to ensure that the field trialists are free to carry out their lawful activity without threat from those who regard themselves as above the law,&quot; Gerry Eckhoff said.</p>
