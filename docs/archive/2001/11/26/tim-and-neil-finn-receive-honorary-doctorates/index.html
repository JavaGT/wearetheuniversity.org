<p>Tim and Neil Finn receive Honorary Doctorates</p>
<p>Tim and Neil Finn will be awarded Honorary Doctorates from the University of Waikato at a ceremony on December 7th at the University&#39;s Academy of Performing Arts.</p>
<p>In announcing the conferment, Vice-Chancellor, Professor Bryan Gould said that the Finns&#39; contribution to New Zealand music and the development of Kiwi culture has been immeasurable.</p>
<p>&quot;Tim and Neil Finn are among this country&#39;s greatest musical talents. They have displayed a talent and determination that has placed them firmly on the international stage. It is fitting that the University of Waikato honours them for their outstanding achievements.&quot;</p>
<p>Raised in Te Awamutu, in the heartland of the Waikato, the Finns&#39; music has had a lasting effect on New Zealand.</p>
<p>At a recent Australasian Performing Rights Association awards ceremony, which named the top Kiwi songs of all time, Neil and Tim Finn shone as leading lights in New Zealand music with six songs in the top 30.</p>
<p>Neil Finn took out the number two spot with &quot;Don&#39;t Dream It&#39;s Over&quot;, and &quot;I Got You&quot; was placed at number 11, with &quot;Weather With You&quot; (which was co-written with Tim) at 16.</p>
<p>Tim Finn&#39;s &quot;Six Months In A Leaky Boat&quot; was voted in at number 5, &quot;I Hope I Never&quot; (25) and &quot;I See Red&quot; at number 28.</p>
<p>&quot;Talents like Tim and Neil&#39;s deserve to be celebrated,&quot; says Professor Gould. &quot;And by celebrating and honouring them, we nurture the many talents that their example has inspired.&quot;</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
