<p>Wetsuit Regulation An Infringement of Personal Rights</p>
<p>ACT Deputy Leader Ken Shirley today called on the Minister of Local Government Sandra Lee to step in and give clear a direction that local councils should not be passing punitive restrictive rules such as that which will see surfers, windsurfers and boogie boarders required to wear wetsuits in Northland and Waikato.</p>
<p>&quot;Compliance with such regulations would be farcical. Do we expect to see armies of inspectors out on the beaches at Whangamata, Waihi and Paihia handing out $200 fines to five-year-old children playing in the shallows with boogie boards?</p>
<p>&quot;This is just more red tape and self-perpetuating bureaucracy. It is meddling in peoples lives and is a quite unnecessary restriction under the guise of safety. As a surfing enthusiast myself I can empathise with the comments made by the Surfing New Zealand President that wetsuits don&#39;t give you any more buoyancy and that `you would die of heat exhaustion before you died of cold&#39; in summer.</p>
<p>&quot;This petty-minded regulation just demonstrates the kind of abuses we can expect from local councils if they are given powers of general competence this Government is determined to award.</p>
<p>&quot;Sandra Lee must urgently take these power-absorbed councils in hand and direct them that regulations such as this won&#39;t be tolerated,&quot; Ken Shirley said.</p>
