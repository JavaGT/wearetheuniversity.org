<p>Maharey quick to criticise TEAC report</p>
<p>Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey and students were the first off the blocks to criticise today&#39;s TEAC report, National&#39;s Tertiary Education spokesperson Maurice Williamson said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey has already said he is against the two main recommendations of the report.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister said today that he is against the recommendation to drop interest rates on student borrowing, a move designed to prevent students using their loans to gain on investments.</p>
<p>&quot;In Parliament on October 17 Steve Maharey also said he was against the recommendation to cap the number of people it subsidises to take particular numbers.</p>
<p>&quot;After spending millions of dollars on TEAC we now have to question his commitment to the report. It&#39;s the same as the McLeod report - the Government spends millions on these reports but won&#39;t take the advice.</p>
<p>&quot;The coupling of tuition and research funding is a good idea which we have always supported. The cost and funding review is well overdue and should have been taking place while TEAC were doing their work.</p>
<p>&quot;This report is an improvement on the first two TEAC reports which were a huge waste of time and an embarrassment. However it is convoluted and it will take some time to work through what the report means because on a first glance it could mean all things to all people,&quot; Mr Williamson said.</p>
