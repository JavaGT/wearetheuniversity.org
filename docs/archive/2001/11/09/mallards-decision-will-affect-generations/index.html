<p>Mallard&#39;s Decision Will Affect Generations</p>
<p>Friday 9 Nov 2001 Donna Awatere Huata Press Releases -- Education</p>
<p>Education Minister Trevor Mallard has a huge opportunity next week to improve literacy for generations of New Zealand children, ACT Education Spokesman MP Donna Awatere Huata said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Next week, Mr Mallard will announce his response to the ground-breaking Select Committee Inquiry into Reading,&quot; Mrs Awatere Huata said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard has a rare opportunity to make a real difference and leave his mark. We cannot afford to get this wrong. Mr Mallard must implement every recommendation of the Inquiry.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Awatere Huata said she was optimistic after Mr Mallard this morning described as &quot;exciting&quot; a report that makes the exact same recommendations as the Select Committee Inquiry.</p>
<p>&quot;I welcome Mr Mallard&#39;s discovery that low expectations for poor kids create poor results. We will know next week if he is sincere about getting rid of bigotry and institutional racism.</p>
<p>&quot;Things are a mess. Seventy per cent of Maori and seventy-five per cent of Pacific Island adults cannot read above minimum levels. Poorer children account for an inordinate number of suspensions and are grossly over-represented in School Certificate failure rates. More than 10,000 students dropped out with no qualifications last year - a higher number than ever before.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand&#39;s parents don&#39;t care how Mr Mallard packages his decision, or what political spin he puts on it. What we want is for him to support the unanimously supported, cross-party findings. We want him to affirm that the damaging whole language-phonics wars are over. We want him to implement innovative new standards for graduating teachers that will ensure new educators have a range of skills that will allow them to teach reading across the entire pre-tertiary sector. We want kids to come first.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr Mallard has a rare opportunity. He has the ability to stamp out the bigotry of low expectations that is widespread through the education service, and implement revolutionary changes that will last for generations. I hope he has the courage to do so,&quot; Mrs Awatere Huata said.</p>
