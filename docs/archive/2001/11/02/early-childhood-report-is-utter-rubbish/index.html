<p>Today&#39;s report on the early childhood sector belongs in the garbage can, ACT Education Spokesman MP Donna Awatere Huata said today.</p>
<p>&quot;This document isn&#39;t worth the paper it&#39;s written on, let alone the thousands of taxpayer dollars that have been wasted. Calling the people who put this together a &#39;working group&#39; is a joke - all these bureaucrats have done is launch a selfish attack on privately-run early education centres.</p>
<p>&quot;The bigotry and ignorance espoused in this report is staggering.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Government adopts a single recommendation of this ridiculous report, they will drive a huge wedge between the wealthy that can afford pre-school and the poor that can&#39;t.</p>
<p>&quot;Cost is the biggest barrier to access. These recommendations are guaranteed to increase the cost of providing services, and that&#39;s going to put pre-school out of reach for the poor.</p>
<p>&quot;Independent early childhood centres are opening up opportunities in poor centres. It is offensive to recommend a moratorium on new centres.</p>
<p>&quot;The entire increase in participation in early childcare in the last decade was a result of 130 percent more children enrolling in privately-run centres. Enrolments in state-owned centres actually decreased by seventeen percent. Yet this &#39;working group&#39; consisted almost entirely of state-owned bureaucrats and academics.</p>
<p>&quot;Kids have been forgotten by the committee who put this report together. Mr Mallard must reject every recommendation. New Zealand&#39;s parents will fight tooth and nail if these opportunity-denying recommendations are implemented by the Labour Government,&quot; Mrs Awatere Huata said.</p>
