<p>Alliance support for Green EUB position welcomed</p>
<p>Green Social Services Spokesperson Sue Bradford today welcomed Alliance support for a Green motion supporting the reintroduction of the Emergency Unemployment Benefit (EUB) for students over summer.</p>
<p>The Social Services Committee today tabled a report in Parliament on its investigation into a petition requesting the reintroduction of the EUB for unemployed students over the summer.</p>
<p>&quot;While Labour, ACT and National refused to support this request I was pleased that the Alliance signed up to a Green minority statement declaring our full support for the reintroduction of this important benefit,&quot; said Ms Bradford.</p>
<p>&quot;Having earlier voted down my private members bill seeking to reinstate this benefit I am pleased that the Alliance, through supporting the Green statement, have confirmed their commitment to seeing the EUB reintroduced.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Bradford said while she was disappointed with the final report she was not surprised at the result.</p>
<p>&quot;At least students around New Zealand know that, after initially letting students down, the Alliance is now firmly supporting the Greens in trying to get the EUB back for students who need it.&quot;</p>
