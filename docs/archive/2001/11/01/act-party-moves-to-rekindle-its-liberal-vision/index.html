<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: THURSDAY, 1 NOVEMBER 2001</p>
<p>ACT Party Moves to Rekindle Its &#39;Liberal&#39; Vision</p>
<p>The ACT Party has launched a project to help redefine the party&#39;s vision as it heads into the next election.</p>
<p>ACT President Catherine Judd says the Liberal Project, being unveiled to members at regional conferences over the next few weeks, is intended to reinforce ACT as the party with a purpose and a vision of a free society.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT was formed to be a party of influence, and our original vision, as outlined in Unfinished Business, was to transform the economy and society. The Liberal Project is designed to recapture that vision and regenerate the Party.</p>
<p>&quot;I’ve invited 11 leading Australian and New Zealand thinkers and audiences mostly from outside of ACT to present papers on aspects of our vision, at regional conferences and meetings between now and early December.</p>
<p>&quot;The project kicked off at last weekend&#39;s Waikato regional conference with Brendan Moyle of Massey University speaking on free-market environmentalism. Other speakers include Greg Lindsay, of the Centre for Independent Studies in Sydney, on &#39;The Liberal Vision&#39;, James Cox on &#39;The Future of the Welfare State&#39;, Michael Bassett on &#39;The Conflict of Visions&#39;, Roger Kerr on &#39;Freedom and Prosperity&#39;, Deborah Coddington on &#39;Liberal Feminism&#39; and James Allan on &#39;Constitutional Democracy&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;I see the project producing a draft vision which we will take to our annual conference next year, for eventual endorsement by ACT members. This will be a consultative process that will involve all members.</p>
<p>&quot;My goal is to position ACT as a party that will appeal particularly to young, urban liberals. This means moving out into a vanguard position that no other party occupies on the political spectrum,&quot; Ms Judd said.<br>ENDS</p>
