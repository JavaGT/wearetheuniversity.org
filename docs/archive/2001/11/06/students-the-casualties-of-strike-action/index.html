<p>Simon Power National Industrial Relations Spokesperson</p>
<p>6 November 2001</p>
<p>Students the casualties of strike action</p>
<p>Students are the one&#39;s hardest hit by the latest round of industrial action to disrupt the education sector, says National&#39;s Industrial Relations spokesperson Simon Power.</p>
<p>&quot;The PPTA resumed strike action today after a week-long break to pursue negotiation, but Education Minister Trevor Mallard is still refusing to budge. This is a far cry from Mr Mallard&#39;s posturing in April 1998 when, as Opposition Education spokesman, he said &#39;by refusing to negotiate the workload issues, the Government is failing to bargain in good faith&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Further rolling strike action means years 11 and 13 students across the country will be asked to spend a day at home this week, missing valuable class preparation time for School Certificate and Bursary exams beginning in just a fortnight on 19 November.</p>
<p>&quot;Continued deadlock over negotiations will mean the remainder of secondary students will be affected until the end of November.</p>
<p>&quot;Adding to the education sector&#39;s industrial strife is trouble in the country&#39;s universities over lecturers&#39; pay. University staff have begun low-level industrial action, which could escalate into the withholding of exam results, the shelving of graduation preparations and the putting on hold of next year&#39;s enrolments.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s crystal clear that students have become the latest casualties of the Government&#39;s employment relations legislation,&quot; said Simon Power.</p>
