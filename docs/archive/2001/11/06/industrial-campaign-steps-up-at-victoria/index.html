<p><strong>Tuesday, 6 November 2001, 4:09 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Association_of_University_Staff">Association of University Staff</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE"><br>At a meeting held today Victoria University staff resolved to step up their industrial campaign, in response to an unacceptable 1.8% salary offer and the continuing erosion of staff employment conditions. This action includes delaying the submission of student grades, the withdrawal of goodwill, and holding a stopwork meeting scheduled for December 13th. Staff also voted to escalate industrial action until their claims were settled.</p>
<p>Reece Walters, AUS Campaign Co-ordinator, said &quot;Staff at Victoria University are angry. The outcome of this meeting sends a clear message to Victoria University&#39;s Vice-Chancellor and the government that our staff mean business.&quot;</p>
<p>A boycott of the December graduation ceremony was seriously discussed at the meeting. This was put aside in favour of attending the graduation ceremony en masse.</p>
<p>Reece Walters commented: &quot;This action sends two messages. First, to our students, that we are proud of and committed to them. And secondly, a large staff presence at graduation will serve to publicly state our opposition to Vice-Chancellor Stuart McCutcheon as well as Steve Maharey for their failure to value university staff.&quot;</p>
<p>Future industrial actions will also include picketing and petitioning. Staff will further discuss the likelihood of strike action at the stopwork meeting on December 13th.</p>
