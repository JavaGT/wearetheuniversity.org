<p><strong>Wednesday, 14 November 2001, 9:16 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Tuesday 13 Nov 2001</p>
<p>ACT Leader Richard Prebble has come to the defence of ACT MP Donna Awatere Huata, who was today the subject of a personal attack by Education Minister Trevor Mallard.</p>
<p>&quot;Donna Awatere Huata&#39;s campaign to improve the ability of New Zealand children to read has the full support of the ACT party - and I believe it should be supported by every MP,&quot; Mr Prebble said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Parliamentary Select Committee inquiry into reading took over 18 months to complete, heard evidence not only from educational professionals, but also from concerned parents and employers, over New Zealand&#39;s declining reading standards.</p>
<p>&quot;The Education Minister Mr Mallard is ignoring irrefutable evidence that our schools are failing to teach too many of our children how to read. As a parent, I know this to be true.</p>
<p>&quot;The ideological refusal of education bureaucrats to recognise the failure of a one-size-fits-all whole language reading programme is a scandal.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a disgrace for Minister Trevor Mallard to attempt to justify his refusal to act to improve children&#39;s ability to read by a vicious personal attack on Donna Awatere Huata - who is a recognised world leader in teaching children to read.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT will not be intimidated. My party regards having an education system that produces students with reading and writing skills to be able to earn a living as a top priority for the country and we are prepared to make it an election issue,&quot; Richard Prebble said.</p>
