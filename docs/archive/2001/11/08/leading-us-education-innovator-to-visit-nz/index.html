The Edison school design, which enters into partnerships with public education authorities to create innovative and world-class public schools, has been implemented in 113 public schools.

He was Chairman of Mayor Giuliani’s Task Force on The City University of New York. During Professor Schmidt’s presidency of Yale University from 1986 to 1992, the institution achieved the highest rate of growth among the major endowed private universities in the United States.</p>
