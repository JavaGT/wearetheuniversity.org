<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>30 October 2001</p>
<p>For immediate release</p>
<p>Students Slam Loan Review Sham</p>
<p>Student representatives are slamming the report of the Education and Science Select Committee into Student Loans and Allowances.</p>
<p>“The membership of the committee have failed to agree on any substantial solutions to the escalating problem of student debt”, said Ayesha Verrall, President of the Otago University Students’ Association.</p>
<p>“It is disappointing for the students and employers who took the time to participate in the review only to find that it has essentially been a waste of our time,” said Ms Verrall.</p>
<p>“The message to students is clear: after a year’s deliberation the select committee cannot agree on a single solution and we can expect tertiary education to continue to be a political football,” said Ms Verrall</p>
<p>“The committee is correct in it one recommendation that more research into the long term effects of tertiary policy is needed, but more research isn’t required to demonstrate that immediate solution is required to prevent the escalation of student debt,” said Ms Verrall</p>
<p>“Young people will be well advised to continue to vote with their feet and leave the country because New Zealand lacks the leadership to confront this problem”, said Ms Verrall.</p>
