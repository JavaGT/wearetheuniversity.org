<p>Nats offer Government numbers on GM</p>
<p>&quot;Biotechnology is too important to New Zealand&#39;s future to let the Greens hold the Government over a barrel,&quot; National&#39;s Environment spokesperson Nick Smith said as the Government finalises its policy on genetic technology at a key cabinet committee meeting today.</p>
<p>&quot;National is willing to work constructively with the Government on upholding the key conclusion of the Royal Commission that New Zealand should adopt a &#39;proceed with caution&#39; approach.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand risks shutting out new medicines and technologies than can improve our health, economy and environment. The Greens&#39; absolute opposition to any form of genetic technology will drive talented New Zealand scientists offshore and rob New Zealand of the opportunities of a knowledge economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Government sources indicate that the moratorium on field trials will be continued for a further two years albeit rebranded as a &#39;constraint&#39;. This exercise in semantics would do a huge disservice to the Royal Commission and the advice of New Zealand&#39;s eight universities,&quot; Dr Smith said.</p>
<p>National&#39;s Leader Bill English today wrote to the Prime Minister formalising National&#39;s willingness to engage with the Government on the Royal Commission&#39;s recommendations.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision on gene technology is pivotal to New Zealand&#39;s future and the nation would be the winner from the stable policy environment if National and Labour could establish a common position.</p>
<p>&quot;National is totally committed to robust independent checks on the health and safety of gene technology but rejects the extreme notion of blanket bans,&quot; Dr Smith said.</p>
