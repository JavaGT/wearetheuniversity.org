<p>Minister asleep at the wheel</p>
<p>Transport Minister Mark Gosche&#39;s failure to address a loophole relating to certain speeding offences is tantamount to sleeping at the wheel, National&#39;s Transport spokesperson Belinda Vernon said today.</p>
<p>&quot;A High Court Judge called on Parliament &#39;to act swiftly&#39; to correct the loophole on September 27. Three weeks later the Minister has done nothing to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;The Judge&#39;s comments call into question thousands of speeding tickets already issued.</p>
<p>&quot;It is inappropriate for police to continue to issue tickets now that they are aware that the law they have been relying on is inadequate.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Gosche has been caught dozing and he must act.</p>
<p>&quot;Speed laws are there to make our roads safer. It is in the interests of public safety to ensure that the law can be relied upon.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders want to know that police officers have the appropriate authority to issue tickets for speeding offences. They also want to know that all speedsters are treated equally under the law,&quot; Ms Vernon said.</p>
