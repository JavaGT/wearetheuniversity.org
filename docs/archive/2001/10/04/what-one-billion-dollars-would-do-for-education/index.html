<p>What One Billion Dollars Would do for Education</p>

<p>The one billion dollars earmarked to prop up Air New Zealand should be spent on making our country&#39;s education system the best in the world, ACT Education Spokesman MP Donna Awatere Huata said today.</p>
<p>&quot;One billion dollars would turn things around. We could spend $300 million on preschools, $300 million on primary education, $300 million on secondary, and inject another $100 million into tertiary education.</p>
<p>&quot;We could ensure every New Zealand child is equipped to deal with the new world economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Why are we still scratching around to get enough money for the basics?</p>
<p>&quot;Parenting programmes to reduce assaults and abuse on children. Yet funding is minimal. Preschools are horrifically underfunded - teachers in this sector get less pay than cleaners.</p>
<p>&quot;Decent primary and secondary school teachers are underpaid and overworked. Increasing demands are being made on the men and women looking after our children - the amount of pointless paperwork they have to create for the pencil-pushers at the Ministry of Education is incredible. Our best teachers are giving up and leaving the country in record numbers.</p>
<p>&quot;The number of children falling through the cracks and not attending any school whatsoever has increased by 1000 percent, yet Mr Mallard&#39;s Government cannot find the money to create a central database to monitor enrolments. These kids will turn into the beneficiaries and criminals of tomorrow - future governments will have to spend millions and millions of dollars to fix this Government&#39;s mistakes.</p>

<p>&quot;We could implement IT systems in every schools to rival the most advanced countries in the world. We could improve our literacy and numeracy campaigns, and ensure every child gets a fair start.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead, we have thirteen year-olds selling themselves on the streets; a twelve year-old charged with murder; and far too many children dying at the hands of their parents.</p>
<p>&quot;Just a fraction of this billion dollars would help fix the crisis in our education system. This Government&#39;s priorities are back-to-front,&quot; Mrs Awatere Huata said.</p>
