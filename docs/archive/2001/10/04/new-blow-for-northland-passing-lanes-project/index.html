<p>New Blow for Northland Passing Lanes Project</p>
<p>Thursday, October 4 2001 Dr Muriel Newman Press Releases -- Transport</p>
<p>The on again off again passing lanes on a dangerous stretch of State Highway 1 south of Whangarei appear to be off again according to the answers to parliamentary questions released to ACT MP Muriel Newman.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister of Transport has confirmed that seven passing lanes are being planned on State Highway 1 from Oakleigh to Waipu but the bombshell is that funding for them has not been approved,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
<p>The Minister states: &quot;Planning is underway and subject to obtaining the usual statutory approvals the priority for funding will be considered in the context of a national strategy for passing lanes that will be completed by the end of this year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I take this to mean that Northland&#39;s passing lane project will go into the queue along with everyone else. There is now no certainty that we will get the funding, although we had been led to believe it was already allocated,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
<p>There will be an opportunity to ask for the support of Parliament next week when the transport select committee hears evidence on Dr Newman&#39;s petition for passing lanes, which was supported by thousands of Northlanders. Robin Shepherd the chair of the transport committee of the regional council will also attend to outline to the select committee how dangerous that stretch of road is.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the recent spate of accidents on the road it is definitely one of New Zealand&#39;s black spots and should receive priority attention,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
