<p>Maurice Williamson National Tertiary Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>3 October 2001</p>
<p>Fail and win under Labour</p>
<p>Government plans to reward student failure through higher levels of tuition subsidy have been criticised by National&#39;s Tertiary Education spokesperson Maurice Williamson today.</p>
<p>In a leaked recommendation from the fourth TEAC report, the Commission recommend that &#39;...certain categories of learners should receive a higher level of government subsidy, including those who had not previously achieved in school or &#39;basic education&#39; &#39;.*</p>
<p>&quot;In other words, this Government is planning to reward students who fail at school. There is no incentive for students to study hard and get good grades.</p>
<p>&quot;Is this what Mr Maharey meant when he promised to reduce tertiary fees for students? Bright students may as well not bother.</p>
<p>&quot;When questioned about the recommendation, Steve Maharey&#39;s response was that he doesn&#39;t comment on drafts. But this recommendation is taken directly from a late draft when the TEAC report was close to being finalised.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey spent nine years in opposition, one would have thought he would have his thinking sorted in that time. He&#39;s now been in office for 21 months and the sector is still none the wiser about the shape of the tertiary education system.</p>
<p>&quot;People thought the Government dithered over Air NZ but Mr Maharey has set a new record in dithering with his plans for tertiary education,&quot; Mr Williamson said.</p>
<p>Ends<br>*Recommendation 35</p>
