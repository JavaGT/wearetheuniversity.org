<p>Mallard bullies private schools</p>
<p>Education Minister Trevor Mallard&#39;s attack on the tax status of private schools is despicable and an abuse of his power as Minister, National&#39;s Education spokesperson Gerry Brownlee said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minster must assure private schools that he&#39;s not following the Prime Minister&#39;s example of using privileged information to give advice to the public.</p>
<p>&quot;I was present at the PPTA conference last week during which Mr Mallard said that as Education Minister he couldn&#39;t draw the tax status of private schools to the attention of the Inland Revenue Department but that someone else could,&quot; Mr Brownlee said.</p>
<p>Mr Brownlee questioned Mr Mallard on his comments in Parliament today. Mr Mallard stood by his remarks and, under the protection of parliamentary privilege, accused Strathallan School of a tax dodge over its lease status. He did not clarify his views on the tax status of other private schools.</p>
<p>&quot;This sort of attack by the Education Minister on private schools is nothing more than an abuse of his power. No wonder he&#39;s known as Parliament&#39;s bully.</p>
<p>&quot;Private schools are amongst New Zealand&#39;s top education providers. While Mr Mallard is intent to skite to his PPTA buddies that the per student funding to private schools will be reduced by 2.24% because of the Government&#39;s cap on funding, we should not forget that they save the state around $2,700 per pupil in costs every year.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard&#39;s philosophical problem with private schools focused on competition and providing a quality education is no reason to launch such an attack,&quot; Mr Brownlee said.</p>
