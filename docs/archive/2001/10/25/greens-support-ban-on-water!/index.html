<p><strong>Thursday, 25 October 2001, 9:43 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>&quot;The Green Party&#39;s support for a ban on water in New Zealand shows how naïve and unscientific the Greens are and illustrates why the Government should ignore their extreme views to ban genetic technologies from New Zealand&quot;, says National&#39;s Environment spokesperson Nick Smith.</p>
<p>In an email response to a spoof highlighting all the dangers and deaths from water, Green MP Sue Kedgley&#39;s office said she was &#39;absolutely supportive&#39; of a ban on dihydrogen monoxide in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greens&#39; support for a ban on dihydrogen monoxide shows just how scientifically illiterate the party is. They would ban anything if it has a slightly scientific name, regardless of the fact that all life would cease without water,&quot; Dr Smith said.</p>
<p>The email on dihydrogen monoxide points out it is a colourless, odourless, tasteless chemical used in all sorts of dangerous industries and that in gaseous form it causes thousands of burns; in liquid form millions of deaths from overdose (drowning), and in its solid state causes tissue damage.</p>
<p>&quot;This spoof pulled on the Greens is not indifferent to that which they have pulled on New Zealanders in their campaign against gene technology. They have highlighted all of the dangers of gene technology, but ignored the huge benefits the new technology can offer to mankind. The 31,000 diabetics who survive because of GM-produced insulin is just one example.</p>
<p>&quot;Gene technology, just like water, offers both benefits and risks. The Government must reject the scientifically illiterate Greens and instead support the Royal Commission&#39;s proposals for sensible controls on this new technology,&quot; Dr Smith said.</p>
