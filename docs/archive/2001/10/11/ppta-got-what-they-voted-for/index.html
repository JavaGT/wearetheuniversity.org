<p>Gerry Brownlee National Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>11 October 2001</p>
<p>PPTA got what they voted for</p>
<p>Today&#39;s protest at Parliament by members of the PPTA was a far cry from the protests of bygone years when a Labour member was only too happy to front up to disgruntled teachers, National&#39;s Education spokesperson Gerry Brownlee said today.</p>
<p>&quot;It says a lot that the Government sent a Minister out to meet two donkeys on the forecourt of Parliament today but refused to meet protesting teachers.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Brownlee told the protesting teachers that the strike action is unacceptable. He said the union has acquiesced to the Government&#39;s workload encumbrance, the NCEA, and now it is punishing students for a breakdown in negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;The union insists on promoting a one-size-fits-all system for New Zealand&#39;s secondary schools. Until it moves out of the twentieth century and comes to grips with the challenges of this millennium, it will never raise the status of teachers.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a strong case for good teachers to be paid more. Speakers at the Knowledge Wave Conference were united in one thing - the value of the education system to our economy and the worth of good teachers.</p>
<p>&quot;The PPTA campaigned on behalf of Labour at the last election. They are now getting what they voted for,&quot; Mr Brownlee said.</p>
