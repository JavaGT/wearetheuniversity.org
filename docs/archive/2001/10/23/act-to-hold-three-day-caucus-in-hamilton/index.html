<p>ACT to Hold Three-Day Caucus in Hamilton</p>
<p>Tuesday 23 Oct 2001 Richard Prebble Press Releases -- Governance &amp; Constitution</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Members of Parliament are holding a three-day Caucus at the Anglesea Motel (36 Liverpool Street) in Hamilton starting at midday Wednesday, October 24 and running to Friday, ACT leader Richard Prebble said today.</p>
<p>The MPs will be joined by Party President Catherine Judd.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be looking to review our strategy following the election of Bill English as Leader of the Opposition,&quot; Mr Prebble said.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT views the National leadership change positively. National needs to target the crucial middle ground and North Island provincial seats.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT&#39;s role will be to go for the list vote and to continue to be the party that advocates a more free enterprise approach.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be important differences in our approach. In the economy, ACT is the low tax party - and I believe the Government should respond to the economic shock of September 11 with a cut to the 39 percent tax rate.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT also believes the events of September 11 justify ACT&#39;s policy of New Zealand rejoining active membership of ANZUS.</p>
<p>&quot;The caucus will be review both our economic and defence policies with a view to their early release.</p>
<p>&quot;While in Hamilton ACT MPs will be visiting a wide range of businesses and taking the opportunity to be briefed on important local issues.</p>
<p>&quot;The Waikato is an important region for ACT. In the last election ACT increased its list vote in every Waikato electorate,&quot; Richard Prebble said.</p>
