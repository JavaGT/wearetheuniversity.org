<p>National gathering puts terrorism under spotlight</p>
<p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs will join leading national and international experts at Waikato University for a New Zealand colloquium on last month&#39;s terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>This is the first time a national meeting has been organised to discuss the causes and probable effects of the September 11 attacks.</p>
<p>The day long seminar on October 27th will see experts from Waikato, Auckland and Otago Universities discuss an importantly diverse range of issues with Government, Opposition and United States Embassy officials.</p>
<p>Event organiser, Professor Dov Bing, says that the unique meeting provides an opportunity to address many of the questions raised in the wake of the attacks and to ask how society moves forward through the conflict.</p>
<p>Professor Bing, from Waikato University, will delve into the character of Osama bin Laden and the terrorist activities of the al-Queda.</p>
<p>The Hon. Max Bradford will look at New Zealand&#39;s defence policy and how it has been affected by the attacks on September 11.</p>
<p>Auckland University&#39;s Dr Paul Buchanan, will focus on how the World Trade Centre suicide bombings have caused the &quot;forced embrace of unconventional warfare in the US strategic perspective.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Robert Pattman, from Otago University, examines the challenges that now face American foreign policy after the terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Dr Leanne Piggott, from the University of Sydney, will discuss the interaction of Islam and Western cultures.</p>
<p>Michael Siyad, who came to New Zealand as a refugee from war torn Somalia, will discuss Islamism in Northern Africa and the Middle East, which is the topic of his doctoral thesis.</p>
<p>The colloquium is jointly sponsored by Waikato University&#39;s Department of Political Science and Public Policy, the Centre for Continuing Education and the WEL Energy Trust Academy of Performing Arts</p>
<p>The day long colloquium is being held at Waikato University at the WEL Energy Trust Academy of Performing Arts.</p>
