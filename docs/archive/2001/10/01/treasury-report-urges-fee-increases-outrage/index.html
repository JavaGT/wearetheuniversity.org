<p>Treasury Report Urges Fee Increases – Students Outraged</p>
<p>A Treasury report obtained by Maurice Williamson under the Official Information Act that urges the government to increase student tuition fees to pay for a tertiary strategic change fund is being met with outrage by students.</p>
<p>“Treasury has shown its true colours. Students were cynical of the new image Treasury put forward with “Towards an inclusive economy”, in hindsight we have been proven right. This is the old Treasury that advocated fee increases throughout the 90s with no consideration of the broader social costs associated with high fees,” said New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) Co-President Andrew Campbell.</p>
<p>“The current government was elected on a mandate of decreasing the costs of education, not increasing them. Advice to increase fees is a waste of taxpayer money. Treasury should wake up and get with the programme,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“The National party also needs to rethink their tertiary strategy. It was thrown out of government because people were sick of their constant advancement of user pays for social services. Supporting this recommendation simply shows they have no new ideas. They should speak to students, we have plenty,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“Maurice Williamson always trumpets Ireland and their tertiary education system. What he forgets to mention is that tertiary education is free in Ireland, and that the Irish government would laugh at the suggestions in this Treasury report,” said Campbell</p>

<p>“Students borrowed nearly $500 million from the student loan scheme to cover their fees last year. If Treasury and the National party had their way we would be borrowing a billion dollars a year for fees alone,” said Campbell.</p>
<p>“It’s time Treasury and their friends in the National party did some analysis on the societal and economic impacts of high fees and student loan debt instead of persisting with outdated and unpopular policies,” said Campbell</p>
