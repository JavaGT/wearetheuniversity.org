<p>Long Term Unemployed Unable to Hold on to Jobs</p>
<p>Tuesday, October 9 2001 Dr Muriel Newman Press Releases -- Employment</p>
<p>A third of all long term unemployed people placed into stable employment in the financial year ended June 30, 2001 had reregistered as unemployed by the end of August, figures released today by ACT Employment Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman reveal.</p>
<p>In response to a written Parliamentary question from Dr Newman, Associate Employment Minister Ruth Dyson said that of the 15,218 people registered unemployed for over six months who were placed in stable employment in the 2000/2001 financial year, some 4794 had re-reregistered as unemployed by August 24, 2001.</p>
<p>&quot;These figures prove that New Zealand is developing a whole underclass of people unable to adapt to the workforce. Since Steve Maharey became Employment Minister the number of people registered unemployed for more than two years has soared by 25 percent to 55,000.</p>
<p>&quot;However, what we can see from the latest figures I have obtained is that the 55,000 figure could actually be conservative. With so many people who gain employment quickly slipping back on to the register and therefore being regarded as newly unemployed, this means there may be many thousands more who have been effectively unemployed for years, barring a few months of work mixed in here and there.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey&#39;s mantra is the creation of &#39;real&#39; jobs &#39; yet he has totally failed to provide help for those who most need it adapting to the workforce.</p>

<p>&quot;The huge flop of Maharey-led projects such as the Community Employment Organisations scheme &#39; which created a paltry 54 jobs at a cost of $1.5 million, when Mr Maharey was expecting 1000 jobs &#39; show that this academic ideologue of a Minister hasn&#39;t a clue how to provide practical assistance for those who need it.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT is committed to putting emphasis on engaging the long term unemployed in 40 hour-a-week job seeking and training schemes. Unless there are Government-led changes which genuinely assist those who have difficulty finding a place in the workforce, then we as country will continue to see long-term unemployed numbers rise with all the associated social problems that brings,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
