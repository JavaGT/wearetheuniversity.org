<p><strong>Tuesday, 27 February 2001, 10:31 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour&#39;s lack of depth in the rural sector is again highlighted with Jim Sutton now responsible for biosecurity, following last week&#39;s removal of Marian Hobbs, National&#39;s Rural Affairs spokesperson Shane Ardern said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Sutton is Minister of Agriculture, Minister for Trade Negotiations, Minister for Rural Affairs and now Minister for Biosecurity! Too much responsibility for one Minister - let alone a Minister who spends a vast amount of time out of New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;Sutton is currently away for week as Minister for Trade Negotiations. What happens if we have another biosecurity catastrophe such as the bee-mite invasion? Biosecurity problems need immediate action. They can&#39;t wait for the Minister to return from abroad or when he&#39;s dealt with his other portfolios before he gets around to the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;This Labour-Alliance Government is full of university lecturers and unionists. Their lack of knowledge of our valuable agricultural and rural sector is only too obvious.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, they have no choice but to add the biosecurity responsibility to an already overloaded Minister. It&#39;s a slap in the face to rural New Zealand that there is absolutely no one else with any experience or knowledge in the Labour caucus.</p>
<p>&quot;This latest development is a risk to our economy. Rural New Zealanders can have no faith in a Government which lacks the understanding and representation of the lucrative rural sector,&quot; Mr Ardern said.</p>
