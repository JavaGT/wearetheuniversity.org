<p><strong>Thursday, 15 February 2001, 6:26 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Gavan Herlihy National Agriculture spokesperson</p>
<p>15 December 2001</p>
<p>Herlihy blames vets&#39; strike on unrealistic union expectations</p>
<p>In a speech in Parliament this afternoon National&#39;s Agriculture spokesperson Gavan Herlihy stated that the pending MAF vets&#39; strike is a direct result of the Government creating unrealistic union expectations in its passing of last year&#39;s Employment Relations Act.</p>
<p>&quot;You created the problem - you go and sort it out,&quot; Mr Herlihy said to his opposite number, the Minister of Agriculture Jim Sutton.</p>
<p>&quot;Its shameful that the Employers&#39; Federation has been left today to lodge an appeal to avert the strike while the Government impotently sits on its hands.&quot;</p>
<p>In his speech Mr Herlihy demanded that the Government not agree to a &#39;soft settlement&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Farmers will ultimately pay for any wage settlement the Government negotiates with its employees - the MAF vets. At stake is more than just disruption to our pre-Easter lamb deliveries to Europe. Our reputation as a reliable supplier of quality meat products is on the line.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not just the farmers who will suffer from the actions of 120 Government-employed vets, it&#39;s the thousands of meat workers who stand to get laid off and the provincial towns that will feel the chill as the meat workers&#39; wage cheques evaporate,&quot; Mr Herlihy told Parliament.</p>
