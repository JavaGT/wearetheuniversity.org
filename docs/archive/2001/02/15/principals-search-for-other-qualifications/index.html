<p>Principals Search For Other Qualifications</p>
<p>Thursday 15th Feb 2001<br>Donna Awatere Huata Media Release -- Education</p>
<p>NCEA implementation had forced state school principals to look elsewhere for senior student qualifications, contrary to a statement by the Minister of Education, said ACT Education spokesman MP Donna Awatere Huata.</p>
<p>“A significant group of principals are not happy with the NCEA because they know it will dumb down our education system.</p>
<p>“Brave principals like Auckland Grammar’s John Morris will not compromise excellence in education and will bring in internationally referenced exams for senior students.</p>
<p>“Mr Morris stated last year that he has already signed an agreement with Cambridge University to offer an international version of England’s A-level examinations for his senior students.</p>
<p>“That is definitely a vote of no confidence in the Minister of Education.</p>
<p>“Similar assessment systems to the NCEA have failed overseas and the Minister of Education needs to stop using New Zealand students as guinea pigs with an untested and untrialled scheme such as the NCEA.</p>
<p>“If more principals take on baccalaureate exams, at least they will lift the standard of assessment in New Zealand education, despite the Minister’s poor judgement”, said Mrs Huata.</p>
<p>“Private schools are being allowed to choose whether or not they offer NCEA. The Minister of Education should extend this choice to state schools to avoid a two-tiered exam system.”</p>
