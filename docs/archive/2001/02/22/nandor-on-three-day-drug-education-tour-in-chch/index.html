<p>Nandor On Three Day Drug Education Tour In Christchurch</p>
<p>Green MP Nandor Tanczos is travelling to Christchurch this Friday for a series of meetings on the issues of youth justice and community-based drug education.</p>
<p>&quot;Support and education services for alcohol and other drugs are chronically underfunded and in many regions there are simply no places to turn for people who need help for their drug use.</p>
<p>&quot;Any changes to New Zealand&#39;s cannabis laws must go hand in hand with sustained investment in public drug education campaigns and investment in facilities and programmes to help people with drug problems,&quot; said Mr Tanczos.</p>
<p>&quot;I am making this trip to talk to young people about their experiences and to look what programmes work and what don&#39;t.&quot;</p>
<p>As part of his Christchurch visit Mr Tanczos will be a guest speaker at a debate on cannabis decriminalisation at Lincoln University on the Friday and that afternoon he will visit Rolleston Prison to be shown around the prison&#39;s drug and alcohol unit.</p>
<p>That evening he will address a public meeting on cannabis issues in the city.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning Nandor will meet with the Restorative Justice Services Trust at the Green Party&#39;s Christchurch Office, followed by a meeting with the members of the Odyssey House Community Alcohol and Drug Service.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Nandor will play a set of reggae at the Flourish Concert in the Christchurch Gardens before meeting with drug workers from the PRYDE programme to discuss community drug education.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening Nandor will finish his trip with a visit to the Kingsley Residential Care Centre to talk with workers and residents.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people who use cannabis do so without problems. For that minority that do there are better ways to deal with them than criminalsing and convicting them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;On this tour I am hoping to see concrete examples of how young people have been helped with their problems instead of simply being convicted and locked up. I will be feeding what I find into the review of cannabis which is currently under way.&quot;</p>
