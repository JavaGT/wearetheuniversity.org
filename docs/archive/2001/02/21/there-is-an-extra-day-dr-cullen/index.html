<p>There Is An Extra Day, Dr Cullen</p>
<p>Wednesday 21st Feb 2001 Ken Shirley Media Release -- Education</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Michael Cullen today proved his lack of ability with numbers, said ACT Deputy Leader and ACC Spokesman Hon Ken Shirley.</p>
<p>“Dr Cullen has been caught out in an embarrassing fashion. ACC admits that it has made an error, while Dr Cullen continues to deny it.</p>
<p>“Dr Cullen slated ACT Deputy Leader Ken Shirley as ‘totally wrong’ in claiming employers were being charged for 275 days.</p>
<p>“It is Dr Cullen who is wrong. Invoices from ACC clearly prove this. They state that the invoice period is 275 days, not three-quarters of a year as outlined by Dr Cullen. When the error was pointed out to them, ACC admitted it was at fault and fixed the problem.</p>
<p>“The calculations are not difficult.</p>
<p>“Dr Cullen is absolutely wrong to assert that the period is 75 per cent of a year. ACC’s invoices show that. ACC issued an amended invoice once the error was spotted.</p>
<p>“Dr Cullen is also wrong in stating that the person had gone into business on June 30, 2000. In fact, they have been in business for several years.</p>
<p>“It is of deep concern that the Minister of Finance can be so wrong on such a basic calculation, yet be entrusted with stewardship of 40 per cent of the country’s GDP.</p>
<p>“Dr Cullen’s glib response ignores the fact that thousands of self-employed New Zealanders are yet again being overcharged by ACC.</p>
<p>“A question for Dr Cullen: How many self-employed people have been overcharged?</p>

<p>“I call on the Minister to purchase a calculator if necessary. Then, he must explain to all self-employed people the basis of ACC’s miscalculation. He must assure affected New Zealanders that they will be refunded.</p>
<p>“This is an issue that will not go away,” concluded Hon Ken Shirley.</p>
