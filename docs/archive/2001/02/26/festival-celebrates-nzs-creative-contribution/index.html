<p><strong>Monday, 26 February 2001, 2:46 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>A festival aimed at promoting New Zealand&#39;s contribution to global culture and celebrating our creative energies and ethnic diversity begins this week.</p>
<p>Open Connection is an international arts and culture festival hosted by Victoria University. Beginning on March 1, the event is a month long party expressly for people to make a noise about where they&#39;re from and where they&#39;re at. Connecting up with Asia 2000, Wellington Fringe Festival, Wellington City Council and Victoria&#39;s student orientation, the festival is an open spree for art, fashion, food, theatre, film, and reading and writing.</p>
<p>Organiser and Victoria University Lecturer in European Languages, Dr Keren Smith says there is too much angst-ridden state of the nation analysis in New Zealand at the moment. &quot;We read about the brain drain, the general who am I crisis in &#39;mainstream&#39; New Zealand and the medals we didn&#39;t win in the Olympics last year - we appear to have a flair for self-flagellation&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time to wake up from the sleep that has kept our eyes wide shut to our creative energies and celebrate the many positive cultural contributions New Zealand has to offer&quot;, she says.</p>
<p>The Open Connection festival is being held in Victoria University&#39;s Quad on March 1 at 8.30 pm. The theme is &quot;Asia connects with Europe connects with Pacific&quot;. Zambesi fashion is the focus and the show owes as much to the theatre as to the catwalk. Three &#39;mansions&#39; act as symbolic gateways confirming the tripartite cultural focus.</p>
<p>Rappers Te Kupu and Don Luchito bring their own powerful rhythmic energy to the event which is followed by an international bash with food from Wellington&#39;s embassies being accompanied by Indonesian Gamelan percussion.</p>

<p>Smith says the opening night demonstrates what the festival is about. &quot;It&#39;s a whole month of openness to take on old moves and make new connections. Instead of herding people into a world that&#39;s getting smaller and smaller, the festival aims at expanding boundaries while respecting the need for personal and individual ground.&quot;</p>
