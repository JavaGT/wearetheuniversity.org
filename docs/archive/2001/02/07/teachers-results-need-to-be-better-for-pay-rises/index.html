<p>Teachers’ Results Need to be Better Before Pay Rises</p>
<p>Wednesday 7th Feb 2001 Donna Awatere Huata Media Release -- Education</p>
<p>ACT Spokesperson for Education Donna Awatere Huata MP said today that she agreed that teachers should have a pay rise but there must be better results.</p>
<p>“I have no objection to teachers getting more money, but every child must be able to competently read and write better before they leave secondary school.</p>
<p>“I agree teachers do need more money. But funds must be distributed to where they are desperately needed and it is the Early Childhood sector that the Minister of Education has been neglecting for far too long.</p>
<p>“I believe that pre-school teachers and reading resources in schools need a huge injection of funds. This Government has given thousands to Tertiary education, and not even worried about the Early Childhood Development. This injustice must be addressed and quickly if children are to achieve excellence.</p>
<p>“Yes, teachers should be allowed their extra $105 million but we must see the results first, otherwise no way,” Mrs Huata said.</p>
