<p><strong>Wednesday, 7 February 2001, 3:20 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>“The Alliance have done a flip-flop on one of their key election promises – free tertiary education,” said New Zealand First Education Spokesperson, Hon Brian Donnelly MP.</p>
<p>During the 1999 election campaign, Alliance candidates gained a great deal of support for their uncompromising stand on this policy, but now that Alliance is in Government their education spokesperson, Liz Gordon is saying it is undeliverable and Jim Anderton has put it on the back burner.</p>
<p>The Alliance promised the people that its total tertiary policy would only cost $500 million, and the Government has already committed that amount to interest free loans for students while they are studying.</p>
<p>The Government is paying less than ever of the proportion of course costs, and the interest rate on existing student loans is higher than when this Government took office.</p>
<p>“The Alliance either got their calculations horribly wrong, or they cynically lied to gain votes,” said Mr Donnelly. “Liz Gordon and Jim Anderton need to come clean with their voters.”</p>
