<p>Bob Simcock National Social Services Spokesperson</p>
<p>20 February 2001</p>
<p>Axing scheme won&#39;t help anyone get ahead</p>
<p>The official axing of the work-for-the-dole scheme will do nothing to lift the sights of a group of long-term unemployed who can work but won&#39;t, National&#39;s Social Services spokesperson Bob Simcock said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey believes that able-bodied people who have drawn a benefit for years and have no intention of working should be propped up by the State without any obligations or questions. But the majority of New Zealanders disagree.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Simcock&#39;s comments come as Parliament debates the committee stages of the Social Security Amendment Bill.</p>
<p>&quot;Mandatory community work was aimed primarily at the long-term unemployed who might have lost motivation and confidence. Work-for-the-dole was all about &#39;reciprocal obligations&#39; where beneficiaries were encouraged to try at the very least. Through sanctions, jobseekers were effectively treated like workers as they faced minor penalties for minor non-compliance.</p>
<p>&quot;Maharey&#39;s new regime takes away all incentives to work. Inevitably, the numbers of long-term unemployed will grow as expectations are lowered and sanctions are removed.</p>
<p>&quot;We all know that the majority of beneficiaries want to work, but without a doubt there is also a percentage who have no intention of working. This is shown in areas like Hawkes Bay where many thousands of seasonal workers have to be imported despite 7.4% regional unemployment. Forestry pruning contractors on the East Coast can not get workers, even though unskilled workers can easily earn $100 a day and more.</p>
<p>&quot;Around 30,000 people and 4,000 organisations participated in the work-for-the-dole scheme, and there are a tonne of success stories. The operators of employment initiatives and many of his own DWI staff are crying out for stronger accountability for &#39;freeloaders&#39;. What they are getting is less.</p>
<p>&quot;But Mr Maharey is not interested in listening. This Government is determined to make it easier for people to take the system for a ride,&quot; Mr Simcock said.</p>
