<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>7 May 2001<br>For immediate release</p>
<p>The Buck Stops Here</p>
<p>Medical students are urging The University of Otago to accept the government fee freeze.</p>
<p>&quot;Accepting the fee freeze is the only way to prevent students from being burdened with additional costs that they can no longer absorb&quot;, said President of the Otago University Medical Students Association, Cindy Towns.</p>
<p>&quot;Otago medical students are already subject to fees of $10 000 per year. An Otago medical student graduates with an average debt of $48 000, 25% of students owe more than $60 000&quot;, said Ms. Towns.</p>
<p>&quot;Many students are angered by the prospect of 20% fee increases when they already struggle with existing fee levels&quot;, reported Ms Towns. &quot;To increase fees again would be a disincentive for students from a lower socio-economic background to study medicine. Such a rise will encourage students off-shore to higher paid jobs which will further worsen present doctor shortages&quot;, argued Ms. Towns.</p>
<p>Increasing the cost of medical education will have a flow on effect into the community as young doctors who do stay will impose their financial burden onto patients&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The University of Otago needs to show students that education is more important than<br>million dollar surpluses&quot;, continued Ms Towns.<br>The buck must stop at the University because medical students simply don&#39;t have any left.<br>ENDS</p>
