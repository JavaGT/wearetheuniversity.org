<p>Green Petition Against Proposed Roads In National Parks</p>
<p>The Green Party Executive today approved a petition seeking to stop proposed roads between Golden Bay and Karamea and South Westland and Otago.</p>
<p>The two roads would travel through two national parks and Green Party co-convenor, and petition holder, Richard Davies said the party was opposing their building on three key reasons.</p>
<p>&quot;These roads are not economically viable, they will be bad for the environment and, quite simply, they are not wanted,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Davies said the two roads would seriously compromise some of New Zealand&#39;s most outstanding conservation drawcards - the Heaphy and Hollyford tracks.</p>
<p>Mr Davies will officially launch the petition on Tuesday 15 May at the Golden Bay end of the Heaphy Track. He will then do the 3 ½ day tramp to the other end.</p>
