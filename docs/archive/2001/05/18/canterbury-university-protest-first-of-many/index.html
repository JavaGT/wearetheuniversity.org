<p><strong>Friday, 18 May 2001, 11:25 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>News that Canterbury University is closing its doors for half a day next Friday in protest at the Government&#39;s secret fee-freeze deal highlights the huge level of frustration Vice Chancellors are feeling, National&#39;s Education spokesperson and Ilam MP Gerry Brownlee said today.</p>
<p>&quot;By forcing universities to freeze fees this year in exchange for a 2.3% funding increase the Government has effectively shifted debt from students to tertiary institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government got away with it in last year&#39;s budget but institutions have now been told of a new fee freeze plan in a secret meeting with Mr Maharey. Universities will reportedly be required to freeze fees in exchange for a 2.6% funding increase for next year.</p>
<p>&quot;The 2.6% increase is being offered in a year in which we have 3.1% inflation and a low New Zealand dollar. The low dollar means staff salaries aren&#39;t internationally competitive and there is pressure on universities to contain costs.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has done nothing to reduce costs for students despite election promises. Any opportunity they now have to do so will be at the cost of course quality.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s announcement by Canterbury University will be the first of many from our tertiary institutions who are spitting the dummy and saying they won&#39;t put up with the unsustainable financial position next year.</p>
<p>&quot;Our tertiary institutions are facing a funding crisis. Universities have to manage increasing budget deficits and cutbacks are being made to education services.</p>
<p>&quot;The Labour Party came into Government promising to increase tertiary funding. Universities have now seen through the shallow promises and are struggling to deal with the reality under this Government,&quot; Gerry Brownlee said.</p>
