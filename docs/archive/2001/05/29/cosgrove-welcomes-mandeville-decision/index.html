<p><strong>Tuesday, 29 May 2001, 2:16 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Waimakariri Member of Parliament Clayton Cosgrove has welcomed the Government&#39;s decision that it will not proceed with building a youth justice facility at Mandeville in North Canterbury.</p>
<p>&quot;I am pleased that as the local Member of Parliament I was able to successfully represent the views of the people of Mandeville and Waimakariri. The local community clearly did not want the facility. However, I also recognise that we need to get on quickly with finding an alternative site.”</p>
<p>“As the Member of Parliament for Waimakariri, my job and duty has always been to represent my constituents. This I have done.”</p>
<p>&quot;I welcome the proposal by Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey to establish a working group of community leaders to draw up a list of possible sites. It is important that we in Christchurch work together to develop a new youth justice facility, given the need for current operations to move from Kingslea as quickly as possible,&quot; Mr Cosgrove said.</p>
