<p>Students Re-Launch National Campaign Against Rape And Violence</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) is re-launching its national campaign against rape and violence &#39;Thursdays in Black&#39; on Thursday May 17.</p>
<p>&#39;Thursdays in Black&#39; invites all people of New Zealand to wear black on Thursdays, teamed with a badge or T-shirt, which reads: &#39;Thursdays in Black - demanding a world without rape and violence&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;The campaign focuses on ways that the individual can challenge attitudes to rape and violence, and reinforces at both a personal and a public level that there is something wrong with a world that will allow the human rights of women, men and children to be abused,&quot; said Dayna Berghan, National Women&#39;s Rights Officer for NZUSA.</p>
<p>&#39;Thursdays in Black&#39; was started by such groups as Mothers for the Disappeared in Argentina, Black Sash in South Africa and the Women in Black movements in Israel-Palestine and the former Yugoslavia. The World Council of Churches has also been involved in facilitating the campaign internationally.</p>
<p>&quot;Wearing black on a Thursday is a gesture of solidarity for all women, men and children who are outraged by the incidences of rape and violence that happen in our communities&quot;</p>
<p>Campus women groups from NZUSA constituent associations and other tertiary associations will be organising actions to publicise the campaign that will draw student and public attention to the campaign.</p>
