<p><strong>Friday, 25 May 2001, 12:33 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>&quot;The Government&#39;s offer of a 2.6% increase to tertiary institutions doesn&#39;t even keep pace with inflation and equates to only 37 cents per student per day,&quot; National&#39;s Tertiary Education spokesperson Maurice Williamson said today.</p>
<p>&quot;It is particularly galling given Labour was elected on a promise to make students better off. The Government can&#39;t keep its promise so it&#39;s planning to blame universities for breaking it.</p>
<p>&quot;The 2.6% funding offer is no more than blackmail: take the money and reduce standards or turn it down and lose last year&#39;s 2.3% increase as well.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is misleading the public over &#39;Centres of Research Excellence&#39; funding. This fund actually reallocates existing money. This Government is trying to give the impression that universities would be a lot better off under this fund. In fact, it&#39;s just blackmailing universities to accept the fee freeze offer with money they already have.</p>
<p>&quot;Financial pressure is building on our tertiary institutions. Last year&#39;s fee freeze deal cost tertiary institutions $17.1 million. This year&#39;s deal will force cutbacks or debt of $70 million on the financially strapped institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s protest at Canterbury University demonstrates the predicament our tertiary institutions are in. The issue is simple. Either Government funding goes up or student fees go up,&quot; Mr Williamson said.</p>
