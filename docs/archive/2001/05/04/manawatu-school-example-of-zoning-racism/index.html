<p>Thursday 3rd May 2001 Donna Awatere Huata Media Release -- Education</p>
<p>ACT MP Donna Awatere Huata said that Education Minister Trevor Mallard must listen to the principal of a Manawatu Intermediate School who is fighting for his students.</p>
<p>“The principal of Monrad Intermediate School, John Forsyth, has slated the zoning system as it is applied at Palmerston North Girls&#39; High School, calling it racist and elitist.</p>
<p>“Mr Forsyth says his pupils have been cut off from gaining entrance to Girls&#39; High – just down the road – by the lop-sided boundaries drawn up by the Girls&#39; High Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>“Mr Forsyth has stated bluntly that the Girls’ High is trying to create a decile 10 school with mostly white faces in it.</p>
<p>“This is exactly the type of problem that zoning creates. This racist system leaves Maori and Pacific Island kids with no options. That is disgraceful.</p>
<p>“Mr Forsyth has written a letter to Mr Mallard – I call on the Minister to answer his appeal urgently, and repeal zoning.</p>
