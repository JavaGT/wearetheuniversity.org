<p>Education Minister Should Be More Upfront About Implications Of Its Student Loan Policy</p>
<p>Green Party MP Sue Bradford has joined tertiary students in calling on Education Minister Steve Maharey to be more upfront about the implications of the Government&#39;s student loan policy.</p>
<p>Papers released to the NZ University Students Association under the Official Information Act show that some low income and unemployed borrowers face longer loan repayment times and increased debt as a consequence of changes to the scheme announced in February.</p>
<p>These issues highlight the problems with the student loan scheme and the Government needs to move quickly to address these concerns, Ms Bradford said.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the scheme should be replaced with a fairer system that actually encourages people into study and then to stay in New Zealand. The student loans scheme is doing neither of these things and it is jeopardising the future economic wellbeing of this country.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Student debt is expected to reach $ 4 billion sometime this year. Growing debt levels will have huge implications on our economy and the ability of students to participate fully in New Zealand life.&quot;</p>
