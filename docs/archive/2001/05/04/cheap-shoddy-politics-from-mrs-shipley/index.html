<p>Cheap Shoddy politics from Mrs Shipley</p>
<p>Member of Parliament for Waimakariri Clayton Cosgrove today responded to the Leader of the Opposition, Mrs Jenny Shipley’s allegations in Parliament yesterday.</p>
<p>“Yesterday, with the protection of Parliamentary Privilege, Mrs Shipley impugned my integrity by alleging that I had prior knowledge of the proposal to site a youth justice facility in my electorate at Mandeville and that I had misled my constituents in Waimakariri.”</p>
<p>“In order to set the record straight I yesterday requested that the Minister of Social Services and Employment Hon Steve Maharey clarify in writing (copy of letter attached) an answer he gave in Parliament yesterday afternoon”.</p>
<p>“I have received the letter from the Minister confirming what I have always maintained from the beginning that I was first advised of the proposed site a few hours prior to the public announcement on 4 April 2001. Given that I have now received this evidence it is clear that I have misled no one,” Mr Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“I assume Mrs Shipley is acting in this way to put up a smoke screen to prevent people in Canterbury from being reminded that as the then Prime Minister she blocked the former Royal New Zealand Airforce Base at Weedons as a potential site for the Youth Justice Centre -South,” Mr Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“Mr Ron Mark has also joined Mrs Shipley in playing petty politics. In a statement released today, Mr Mark expressed surprise that I was out of the House while the issue was being discussed.”</p>

<p>“He was right. I travelled to Christchurch prior to the House sitting to meet with Mr Michael Beard, Managing Director of TranzRail, to continue to make a case for the people of Kaiapoi to have barrier arms installed at the Williams Street Rail Crossing. As a result of this case being presented to him, Mr Beard gave me a commitment that barrier arms would be installed at the crossing sooner rather than later.”</p>
<p>“Whilst Mr Mark was playing politics, I was doing my job working for my constituents in the Waimakariri Electorate,” Mr Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“I have been absolutely consistent in my opposition to the proposal by Child Youth and Family Services to site the Youth Justice Facility - South in Mandeville because in my view the site is inappropriate and I am doing everything in my power to represent the views of my constituents.”</p>
<p>“Mrs Shipley and Mr Mark should stop taking cheap political shots, get their facts straight and stop using the people of Mandeville as a political football to try and score cheap points where a very serious issue is concerned,” Mr Cosgrove said.</p>
