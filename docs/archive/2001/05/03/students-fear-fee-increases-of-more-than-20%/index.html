<p>Press Release For Immediate Release</p>
<p>Government Must Back Education - Students Fear Fee Increases of more than 20%</p>
<p>Concerns raised by Tertiary institutions that the government’s impending &quot;fee freeze&quot; offer will not be enough are felt strongly by students.</p>
<p>University of Canterbury Students’ Association President, Jarrod Gilbert, said that the government has to show its commitment to the sector by funding it appropriately and supported similar calls from institution heads.</p>
<p>&quot;Our universities must be funded to a degree that provides for adequate teaching and research. Last years fee freeze did not keep up with CPI and lead to operational cuts of 3.6% to all departments. It has also lead to staff positions not being refilled. You can’t run a university in such a manner and expect good results,&quot; said Mr. Gilbert.</p>
<p>&quot;However, it is unacceptable that students feel the brunt of this through fee increases.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For the past 10 years under-funding has meant increased fees. The bottom line is that fees can not increase,&quot; said University of Canterbury Students’ Association president, Jarrod Gilbert.</p>
<p>&quot;Institutions are in the unenviable position of having to choose between an inadequate amount of government funding or a massive increase in student fees. Due to the ratio of government to student funding, just to match the rumored 3.8% government offer, institutions would have to raise student fees by 11.4%. Obviously, if they are going to turn that down, they will be wanting more. The Vice Chancellor at Canterbury has said a 7% increase in government funding is required, without such an increase student fees would have to rise by 21%. Students simply won’t put up with that.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Gilbert also said that such fee increases would mean fewer people will choose to come to university.</p>
<p>Mr. Gilbert was unsure where the rumored fee freeze figure of 3.8% had come from and said his sources suggested it would be less than that.</p>
<p>The government must come good on its promise of ensuring fee stabilisation while also protecting the integrity of our universities.</p>
<p>Last time fees increased Canterbury students closed down the University registry and rocked the then National government.</p>
