<p><strong>Thursday, 10 May 2001, 2:00 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Towing Companies To Become A Target For Attention - At Last</p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters, today applauded the efforts of entertainer Gary McCormick for standing up to the Wellington Towing Company which removed and impounded his car recently, following an unfortunate mechanical breakdown on a busy Wellington thoroughfare.</p>
<p>Having received assistance to move his car to a safer position which did not impede the flow of traffic, he returned to find his car removed. He has resisted demands to pay a towing and parking fee, to the company involved</p>
<p>“Gary may not realize it, but he is, expressing the views of tens of thousands of New Zealanders, who have been treated very shabbily by tow companies, but for reasons of desperation, have had to buckle to the ridiculous demands made to extort money, in order to regain access to their vehicle.</p>
<p>For too long, towing companies have ridden roughshod over the rights of New Zealanders and the focus now being brought to their mafia style activities is long overdue”, Mr Peters said.</p>
<p>“I offer my support and assistance to Gary McCormick as his tussle with the towing company proceeds.</p>
<p>I am very impressed with the tenacity he has shown and his willingness to stand up to their thuggish behavior. I have seen grown men and women reduced to tears by the standover tactics of towing companies demanding excessive amounts of money for their minimal services, and I find their attitude most repugnant. At last we have an individual prepared to stand up to these people and I urge every New Zealander to get in behind, and support him.” Mr Peters concluded.</p>
