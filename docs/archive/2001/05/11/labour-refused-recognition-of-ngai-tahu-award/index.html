<p>Labour Refused Recognition Of Ngai Tahu Award</p>
<p>Ron Mark, New Zealand First MP from Rangiora said today he was saddened and perplexed as to why Labour’s Michael Cullen and Rick Barker refused his efforts to move a members Notice of Motion which sought to congratulate Doctor Terry Ryan for having been awarded an honourary doctorate by Lincoln University.</p>
<p>“While I accepted their view, that often members seek to take up the valuable time of the House, with trivial Notices of Motion, this was not an insignificant motion.</p>
<p>“Maoridom are in need of honourable role models who achieve and are recognised at the highest levels of academia. When I tried to bring one such person to the attention of the nation, Labour classifies it as trivia,” said Ron Mark.</p>
<p>“Doctor Terry Ryan is an outstanding New Zealander who has dedicated over 30 years of his life to researching, compiling, recording and maintenance of indigenous and contemporary genealogy. That he should gain national and international recognition as an expert in his field is a cause for much pride.”</p>
<p>“Quite unfairly I had anticipated that other parties in the House might have denied me leave. They did not. The only party to refuse me recognising Dr Terry Ryan for his work was Labour. I find that very disappointing and devoid of understanding,” concluded Mr Mark.</p>
