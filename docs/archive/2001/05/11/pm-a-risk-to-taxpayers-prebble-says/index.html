<p>PM a Risk to Taxpayers, Prebble says</p>
<p>Friday 11th May 2001 Richard Prebble Media Release -- Other</p>
<p>Attorney General Margaret Wilson’s attempt to justify the expenditure of more than $100,000 of taxpayers’ money to indemnify the Prime Minister for her reckless defamation, doesn’t stack up, ACT leader Richard Prebble says.</p>
<p>“Ms Wilson claims that this kind of payment is usual. It isn’t,” Mr Prebble said.</p>
<p>“The $55,000 payment, plus legal costs, is the largest settlement ever made by the taxpayer on behalf of a Minister in a defamation suit. It’s the first time the government has tried to make such a settlement in secret.”</p>
<p>Mr Prebble said the Attorney General should explain why she didn’t advise Parliament of the settlement, as has always been done in the past.</p>
<p>“To the best of my knowledge, no Prime Minister has ever had to pay out such a sum,” he said.</p>
<p>“Certainly, Jim Bolger never did in his eight years as Prime Minister, nor did Geoffrey Palmer, or Mike Moore or even Sir Robert Muldoon.</p>
<p>“Sir Robert was sued several times but won every case while he was Prime Minister. He lost once as Finance Minister and had to pay only a few thousand dollars.</p>
<p>“What should concern the Attorney General is that this is the second defamation case that Helen Clark has had to settle in less than two years.</p>
<p>“When she outrageously defamed a leading Auckland surgeon, for which she had to apologise and pay damages, the cost was believed to be more than $55,000. In that case, because she was Opposition Leader, she had to pay herself.</p>
<p>“It shows how indefensible this indemnity for the Prime Minister is,” Mr Prebble said.</p>
<p>“Our Prime Minister has a tendency to attack the man, not the issue, and speak without thinking, and this second case in two years shows our PM is now a real risk to the taxpayer.</p>
<p>“I could name a number of other New Zealanders who could sue the PM for defamation, including Kit Richards, the former Timberlands CEO and those distinguished civil servants she described as ‘geriatric generals’.”</p>
<p>Mr Prebble said in his 23 years in Parliament he had never received a lawyer’s letter related to defamation, so the idea that MPs face defamation cases all the time, just isn’t so. ”</p>
