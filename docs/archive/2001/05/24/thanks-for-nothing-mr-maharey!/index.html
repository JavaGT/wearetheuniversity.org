<p><strong>Thursday, 24 May 2001, 5:54 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association">Victoria University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Students are the big losers in this year’s government budget, facing either massive fee increases, a decrease in the quality of education they receive, or quite possibly both, according to Chris Hipkins, President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association.</p>
<p>“Whichever way you look at today’s budget announcement, students are the losers. If universities turn down the fee freeze offer, the fee hikes we face next year will be huge. If they don’t, we’ll face more budget cuts within the university, more staff redundancies, and a lower standard of education,” Mr. Hipkins said.</p>
<p>“Labour and the Alliance both campaigned on a platform of bringing down the cost of tertiary education. Helen Clark even signed her name to a pledge card stating she would personally be held accountable for delivering it, and yet they have failed miserably,”</p>
<p>“Mr Maharey has talked about bringing an end to the market-driven competitive model for tertiary education, and yet he has done nothing to achieve it. It’s time for Mr Maharey to put the government’s money where his mouth is,”</p>
<p>“After a decade of being dumped on by successive National governments, students held high hopes for the present coalition. Today’s budget has left us feeling completely let down,” Mr. Hipkins concluded.</p>
