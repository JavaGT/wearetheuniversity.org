<p><strong>Thursday, 24 May 2001, 4:46 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>The Otago University Students Association describes today’s budget as, “disappointing given the Labour Party’s clear mandate to improve access to tertiary education,” according to President Ayesha Verrall.</p>
<p>“The Labour Party was elected on the promise of tuition fee freezes. It is disappointing to see that rather than meet the cost of that promise they have passed it on to institutions,” said Ms Verrall</p>
<p>“Student hopes for fee stabilization and something to stop the mounting tide of student debt are now with the University Council. We hope the additional research funding offered will satisfy the Council and it won’t attempt to extract more money from students.”</p>
<p>Despite her disappointment Ms Verrall believes the University must accept the offer for a further year, “the alternative is an estimated 25% fee increase, which won’t be tolerated by students”.</p>
<p>“The government has also sentenced students who cannot find employment to another summer of starvation with its failure to fund the Emergency Unemployment Benefit.”</p>
<p>“This government had a mandate to remedy a tertiary sector education in crisis. Instead the barriers to education continue to mount,” concluded Ms Verrall.</p>
