<p>Helen Clark Ordered Rankin’s Sacking</p>
<p>Wednesday 9th May 2001 Richard Prebble Media Release -- Other</p>
<p>The ACT Party believes the real reason the Prime Minister is refusing to answer questions on the merger of WINZ and the Ministry of Social Policy - and other Ministers are covering up for her - is because it’s the Prime Minister who ordered that Mrs Rankin not be re-appointed.</p>
<p>“If the facts came out, it would show that this massive re-organisation, affecting thousands of civil servants, is a vindictive action just to dismiss one person,” ACT leader Richard Prebble said.</p>
<p>“We believe the Prime Minister is also reluctant to answer questions because it will show she did not act in good faith with respect to Mrs Rankin, as is required under Labour’s own employment laws” Mr Prebble said.</p>
<p>ACT on Monday wrote to the Employment Court seeking clarification of an in-chambers court ruling which Ministers have used as an excuse not to answer Opposition questions on the merger of WINZ and the Ministry of Social Policy.</p>
<p>“The reply from the registrar makes it clear that this was a private ruling of the court and applied only to Mrs CK Rankin and the State Services Commissioner. It was never intended to be made public,” Mr Prebble said.</p>
<p>“It’s clear from the court’s reply that the Prime Minister’s claim that she can’t give any details of her role, are incorrect.”</p>
