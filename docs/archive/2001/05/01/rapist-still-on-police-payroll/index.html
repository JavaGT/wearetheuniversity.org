<p>Rapist still on police payroll</p>
<p>The Police Commissioner has confirmed that police officer and convicted rapist Colin McLean will continue to be paid $1000 a week until his almost certain appeal is over, National&#39;s Police spokesman Tony Ryall said today.</p>
<p>&quot;How many tens of thousands of dollars of scarce police funding will continue to be paid into this convicted rapist&#39;s bank account while his victim receives nothing?</p>
<p>&quot;When asked in Parliament how much longer McLean will stay on the police payroll the Minister replied &#39;as long as it takes&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;The police hierarchy have been expecting this conviction for at least 17 months. A swift dismissal following conviction on 3 April should have been planned. The hierarchy owe New Zealanders, and other police officers in particular, an explanation for this appalling situation.</p>
<p>&quot;The chances of McLean receiving a PERF payment are nil. The Minister has missed the point. The Commissioner can dismiss McLean and he should have done so. Good faith bargaining doesn&#39;t apply to rapists,&quot; Mr Ryall said.</p>
