<p><strong>Tuesday, 8 May 2001, 11:38 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT Environment Spokesman MP Gerry Eckhoff today called for an urgent debate on the High Court decision against the Environmental Risk Management Authority (ERMA).</p>
<p>“We have heard rhetoric from the Greens for weeks,” Gerry Eckhoff said.</p>
<p>“Today I want to give Jeanette Fitzsimons an opportunity to front up and support her emotive arguments with a fact or two.</p>
<p>“This issue must be debated. The Greens must produce facts, rather than relying on specious metaphysical beliefs.</p>
<p>“The Greens have painted a dishonest picture of ERMA scientists. The Environmental Risk Management Authority consists of highly principled people who do a difficult job very well.</p>
<p>“The fact is that New Zealand had an excellent opportunity to utilise science to better the lot of thousands of sufferers of Parkinson&#39;s disease, Cystic Fibrosis and Multiple Sclerosis.</p>
<p>“This research could have benefited so many people, and it could have been done right here in New Zealand. Jeanette Fitzsimons stopped that from happening.</p>
<p>“The ERMA exists to put checks in place. Now, Jeanette Fitzsimons and her eco-moralist friends flout the Authority, taking spurious legal action based on their own subjective ethics.</p>
<p>“Jeanette Fitzsimons claims to know better than the scientists. I want her to tell that to the mother of a child with Cystic Fibrosis. I want her to explain herself to every New Zealander who knows somebody with Parkinson&#39;s Disease, Cystic Fibrosis or Multiple Sclerosis,&quot; Gerry Eckhoff said.</p>
