<p>Scrapping Of Skyhawks A Step Towards More Independent Policy</p>
<p>Green Party Defence Spokesperson Keith Locke welcomed today&#39;s defence changes as a major step towards a more independent policy.</p>
<p>&quot;This announcement is an historic change away from New Zealand&#39;s traditional subordination to Australia and America in its defence strategies,&quot; said Mr Locke.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than being geared to fight a major war alongside America and Australia, we&#39;ll now be more appropriately equipped for peacekeeping, as in East Timor.</p>
<p>&quot;We applaud the Government for the scrapping of the Skyhawks, which have never been used operationally in the 30 years we&#39;ve had them.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is right to concentrate on improving the workhorses of the Air Force - the Hercules and our helicopter fleet - which have proven their worth once again in East Timor,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not an isolationist step. With a revamped army we will be able to work with a wider range of countries in international peacekeeping.</p>
<p>&quot;We reject National&#39;s charges that the Government is out of tune with public opinion in making these announcements.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the Government is catching up with public opinion, which has long been opposed to the purchase of new frigates,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although people like to see the Skyhawks at air shows, most people would agree that the $200 million spent on them annually could be better spent on more useful ships and planes.</p>
<p>&quot;The $400 million annually spent on the frigates is also wasted money. While we support the decision to replace the Canterbury with a long-range multi-purpose ship and fisheries patrol boats, we would like the government to go even further and let go the two remaining ANZAC frigates.</p>
<p>&quot;The resultant saving would more than cover the extra the government needs to re-equip the army,&quot; said Mr Locke.</p>
