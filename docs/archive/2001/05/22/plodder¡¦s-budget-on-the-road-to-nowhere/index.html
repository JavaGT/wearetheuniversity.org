<p>Plodder¡¦s Budget : On the Road to Nowhere</p>
<p>Tuesday 22nd May 2001 Rodney Hide Media Release -- Economy</p>
<p>The country needs a Budget that celebrates business and entrepreneurship and removes the hard, dead foot of government that is costing jobs and opportunities, ACT Finance spokesman Rodney Hide says.</p>
<p>¡§Instead the Labour-led government will deliver a ¡¥plodder¡¦s Budget¡¦ without vision or direction. The one thing the country desperately needs is a tax cut - the one thing Michael Cullen can¡¦t deliver on,¡¨ Mr Hide said.</p>
<p>¡§His spin will be that the Budget is fiscally prudent and there¡¦ll be much trumpeting of a few taxpayer dollars sprinkled around research, science, regional development and paid parental leave.</p>
<p>¡§These dollars will only serve to oil the wheels of interest groups and will be wasted. They won¡¦t provide any strategic direction for the country. So much for fiscal prudence.</p>
<p>¡§It¡¦s going to be a grey Budget with nothing to excite or interest,¡¨ he said.</p>
<p>¡§Last year¡¦s goal of ¡¥Closing the Gaps¡¦ was hastily abandoned. This year¡¦s goal of ¡¥Economic Transformation¡¦ will likewise soon face the chop. It will prove just as elusive.</p>
<p>¡§The government is heading the country in the exact opposite direction to the one required to transform New Zealand into a high-growth, high-wage productive economy. We are now completely out of step with best practice in the rest of the developed world,¡¨ Mr Hide said.</p>

<p>¡§The Labour-led government is:</p>
<p>„h Re-regulating, not deregulating. Employers must now negotiate collective contracts through third-party unions and meet vague ¡¥good faith¡¦ provisions;</p>
<p>„h Re-nationalising, not privatising. The Accident Insurance Industry has been re-nationalised, privatisation of TVNZ and NZ Post has been abandoned;</p>
<p>„h Increasing expenditure, not cutting it. The $5 billion NZ First extra spending has been topped by another $6 billion;</p>
<p>„h Increasing taxes, not cutting them. The top rate was hiked to 39 cents, $100 million in tobacco tax, roll-back of tariffs and a $200 million retrospective GST grab;</p>
<p>„h Expanding welfare , not curtailing it. Income related rents favour those in a state house over private accommodation, student loans favour rich students as well as poor, pensions have increased at the expense of the young.</p>
<p>¡§The Government¡¦s prescription can be summarised as more state direction and less personal freedom,¡¨ Mr Hide said.</p>
<p>¡§Instead of a clear set of rules, we have government by fiat whereby the bizarre Byzantine environmental rules can be ridden roughshod over so long as Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton agrees.</p>
<p>¡§The focus in the Budget won¡¦t be on the broad direction the government is taking but rather on minor details. It won¡¦t see the wood for the trees,¡¨ he said.</p>
<p>¡§The $6 billion extra spending is only five percent of government spending over three years. The so-called big boost to tourism of $4 million is handing back only one-hundredth of one percent of what government takes in tax in the first place.</p>
<p>¡§Instead of reaffirming private property rights, we have the dispensing of Ministerial favours to those whom the government chooses to smile upon.</p>
<p>¡§The result is that the outlook is for New Zealand to be piddling along at 2.5 percent or so growth when we should be striving towards 5 percent or more. We have hit 5 percent before. We need to do so again. Otherwise, we are destined to see our relative standard of living continue to slide.</p>
<p>¡§Labour and the Alliance along with the Greens have turned their back to the free market and to private enterprise. The result is now sadly all too plain to see,¡¨ Mr Hide said.</p>
