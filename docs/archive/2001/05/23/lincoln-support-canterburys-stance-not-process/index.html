<p>Lincoln Support Canterbury&#39;s Stance But Not Process</p>
<p>Lincoln support Canterbury&#39;s Stance but not process Lincoln University Students&#39; Association (LUSA) announced their support for the University of Canterbury Students&#39; Association (UCSA) in their demand for more government funding of the tertiary sector but expressed concern at the form of protest.</p>
<p>&quot;The difficulty with protesting against the funding offer is that it gives institutions the option to increase student fees&quot; said Chambers, President of LUSA. &quot;while we agree with the Canterbury line that the funding is too little, we have to make sure that students don&#39;t end up footing the bill&quot;.</p>
<p>In a meeting today, the LUSA executive decided that this Friday was too soon to strike and risked misrepresenting the situation at hand. &quot;For us, this Friday is the last day of semester and an important time for students to spend with their lecturers,&quot; said Greg Henderson, Vice President of LUSA.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is preaching a knowledge society but a knowledge society comes with a price,&quot; said Maria McNeill, Women&#39;s Officer at LUSA, &quot;If the government wants a knowledge society, they must put their money where their mouth is.&quot;</p>
