<p>Schools Must Not Tailor Timetables for the Tardy</p>
<p>Tuesday, September 25 2001 Dr Muriel Newman Press Releases -- Education</p>
<p>ACT Youth Affairs Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman said today it was be ridiculous for schools to even be considering beginning classes later in the day because students couldn&#39;t get out of bed on time.</p>
<p>The media reported yesterday that Wellington High School was considering commencing classes an hour later from next year to better fit in with teenagers&#39; body clocks and to combat lateness.</p>
<p>In response Dr Newman said: &quot;Changing the school timetable to change the poor habits of tardy students would send out all the wrong signals. Society needs young people to take responsibility for their actions and their lives.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents are expected to teach their children appropriate life skills and habits. Changing the whole school system to suit a minority of students and parents that have not got it right is extremely should not be remotely contemplated.</p>
<p>&quot;High school is a training ground for further education and the workforce. It is important that students learn to be punctual. If they are arriving at school late then the school should sanction them. If they are too tired to learn, their parents need to be told.</p>
<p>&quot;One of ACT&#39;s core values is that people must take responsibility for their own actions. This means that if you want a good education you turn up at the time the educators think is appropriate. Both students and parents need to know that if they want to make the most of those school years not only should students turn up on time, but they should be ready to learn.</p>
