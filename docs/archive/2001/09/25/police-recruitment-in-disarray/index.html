<p>Tony Ryall National Police Spokesperson</p>
<p>25 September 2001</p>
<p>Police recruitment in disarray</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s police recruitment programme is in disarray with one of this year&#39;s two remaining recruitment wings deferred until next year, National&#39;s Police Spokesman Tony Ryall said today.</p>
<p>&quot;This means it will take even longer to get desperately needed new policemen and women onto the streets.&quot;</p>
<p>National understands that there was to be a wing of some 80 recruits starting at Police College next week. However, this number has now been cut to 60 and the wing will not start until mid-November.</p>
<p>What&#39;s more, the recruitment wing scheduled for mid-November will now commence in mid-January.</p>
<p>National understands the Police are having trouble filling these wings despite a million-dollar advertising campaign.</p>
<p>The last three recruitment wings to undergo training have had less than the target 60 recruits that were planned for each.</p>
<p>&quot;Frontline police vacancies total some 375 throughout New Zealand. With another wing deferred and increased resignations likely because of the Police Amendment Bill, Mr Hawkins is making a complete hash of the job.</p>
<p>&quot;Throughout New Zealand police are calling for more frontline staff. As long as there&#39;s an incompetent in the Police Minister&#39;s chair who thinks he can run the police better than the professionals, people won&#39;t want to serve,&quot; Mr Ryall said.</p>
