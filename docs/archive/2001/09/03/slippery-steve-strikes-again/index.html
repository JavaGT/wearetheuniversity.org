<p>Maurice Williamson National Tertiary Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>3 September 2001</p>
<p>Slippery Steve strikes again</p>
<p>National&#39;s Tertiary Education spokesperson Maurice Williamson says the audacity of Steve Maharey knows no bounds.</p>
<p>&quot;I am gobsmacked. Not only is Steve Maharey claiming he&#39;s kept his promise to reduce the cost of tertiary education for students, he&#39;s trying to spin a story that he&#39;s somehow saved them money!&quot; Mr Williamson said.</p>
<p>Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey made the claim that &#39;students will save $1,000 on average next year [as a result of fee stabilisation]&#39; and &#39;the Government has now delivered on that promise [to reduce the cost of tertiary education] two years running&#39;, in a speech prepared for the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association conference at Massey University&#39;s Albany campus.</p>
<p>&quot;Fortunately fate intervened and &#39;travel difficulties&#39; meant Steve&#39;s speech was never delivered.</p>
<p>&quot;This sort of spin is outrageous. Steve has let students down and now he&#39;s treating them like sycophants who will lap up anything he says.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey has blackmailed universities to maintain fees at their existing level. There has been no reduction in fees, but there will be a reduction in course quality, resources and an increase in class sizes - Steve doesn&#39;t want to tell students that though. And students shouldn&#39;t forget that Steve promised to bring back the EUB but now he&#39;s in Government he can&#39;t do that.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve promised everything and all he has delivered is a bunch of reports and financially strapped universities. Steve is always talking about the &#39;nine long years&#39; he spent in Opposition but he obviously didn&#39;t use that time constructively to develop policies. Twenty months into the new regime, Steve still has no idea what the future of tertiary education will look like.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve&#39;s performance as Tertiary Education Minister would be lucky to get a c-minus, even if it was internally assessed,&quot; Mr Williamson said.</p>
