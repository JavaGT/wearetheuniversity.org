<p>Aid should not be a hostage of trade - Greens</p>
<p>Green Foreign Affairs spokesperson Keith Locke is backing a proposal to deliver New Zealand&#39;s foreign aid through an autonomous agency separate from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).</p>
<p>A ministerial review team made the proposal in a report released today.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m disappointed the Government is not going the whole hog to a fully independent NZAID agency. However, the Greens recognise it is a major step forward for aid to be delivered through an autonomous unit within MFAT with its own career structure and reporting to its own Minister.</p>
<p>&quot;Under MFAT aid has often been a hostage to trade and commercial interests, and to the need to flatter particular governments,&quot; Mr Locke said.</p>
<p>&quot;Ninety percent of our education aid to overseas countries goes on tertiary scholarships, which is a form of aid to New Zealand universities and polytechnics. Those on scholarships are often the sons and daughters of government officials in Asian and Pacific countries.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet we live in a region where many kids don&#39;t go to school. Less than 40 percent of Solomon Island children get a primary education.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Locke said that the Green Party agreed that New Zealand&#39;s aid should be used to overcome the poverty which is so prevalent in the Pacific.</p>
<p>&quot;The lack of jobs and social services is behind the crises we&#39;ve seen in the Solomons and Fiji. We also have a responsibility to help stop the environmental degradation of the Pacific, in the form of waste accumulation and loss of natural heritage,&quot; Mr Locke said.</p>

<p>&quot;Hopefully, the new dedicated aid agency will be staffed by aid professionals, not by career diplomats dabbling in aid work between political or trade postings.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Locke hoped the new agency would better harness the energy of non-governmental organisations like Oxfam, and could draw on the experiences of New Zealand community groups in terms of development models.</p>
<p>The review team lauds non-governmental work, but is critical of much of the aid delivery of MFAT officials.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greens also believe the Government should substantially increase the aid budget, which the review team points out is only 0.27 percent of our GNP,&quot; he said.</p>
