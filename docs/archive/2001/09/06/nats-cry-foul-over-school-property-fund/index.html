<p><strong>Thursday, 6 September 2001, 1:59 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesperson Gerry Brownlee is questioning how the $20 million of property funding was allocated after 13% of the fund went to Avondale College, in the Prime Minister&#39;s electorate, who already have fabulous facilities.</p>
<p>&quot;When a school&#39;s own principal is questioning the logic of the allocation of the money because his school has &#39;some of the best facilities in the country&#39; and he doesn&#39;t even know &#39;in which aspect of the new national standard his school was deficient&#39;, some serious explaining needs to be done.</p>
<p>&quot;The Prime Minister seems to think Avondale College needs 13% of the fund saying the money for the college &#39;reflected the importance the Government placed on bringing every school to a new property standard&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Hundreds of schools around the country that look like the poor cousins to Avondale College are asking when will the Prime Minister place the same importance on them?</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister needs to explain how this inequity happened. The decision to give a $2.6 million property fund handout to the stunning Avondale campus makes a joke of the funding formula.</p>
<p>&quot;The funding formula for the secondary school property guide is so out of step with the real needs of New Zealand&#39;s secondary schools one has to question what&#39;s going on in the Beehive,&quot; Mr Brownlee said.</p>
