<p><strong>Thursday, 6 September 2001, 11:26 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association">Victoria University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>5 September 2001</p>
<p>Students at Victoria University are expected to give Wellington mayoral candidates a thorough quizzing at a mayoral candidates forum being organised by the Students&#39; Association next week. With over a dozen candidates for the position of mayor, and no obvious front-runner, the mayoral race this year is set to be one of the liveliest in ages.</p>
<p>VUWSA President Chris Hipkins said there had been a very positive response from the candidates invited, and already Mary Varnham, John Morrison, Stephanie Cook, Kerry Prendergast, Rob Goulden and Andy Foster had confirmed they would be attending.</p>
<p>&quot;Wellington students are some of the most politically active in the country, as evidenced at the last general election when students played a critical role in unseating Richard Prebble from his Wellington Central seat. We are expecting students to take a keen interest in the local government elections this year, and with many thousand students living in the area there is the possibility they may well form a large voting bloc,&quot; Mr. Hipkins said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many issues on the local government agenda that have sparked a substantial amount of student interest recently, including city safety, closed circuit security surveillance, the motorway extension, and the proposals for buildings on the waterfront. I expect all of these issues will be the subject of debate at next week&#39;s forum,&quot; Mr. Hipkins said.</p>
<p>The forum will be held on Wednesday 12th of September at 12noon in Meeting Room One of the Student Union Building at Victoria University. All members of the public are welcome to attend.</p>
