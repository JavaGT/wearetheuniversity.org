<p><strong>Thursday, 20 September 2001, 11:08 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>To mark Youth Week (September 17 - 24) Green MP Nandor Tanczos is asking young people to express their thoughts on what it means to be human.</p>
<p>The theme of Youth Week is &#39;Express Yourself&#39; and Nandor today wrote to all High Schools in the country asking students to express - in any form they wish - their thoughts on what it means to be human.</p>
<p>The form the entries can take are unlimited and can include stories, poems, paintings, posters, music or sculpture. Entries are to be sent to Nandor at Parliament by Friday 12 October with contact details.</p>
<p>&quot;At a time when some forces in the world are pitting people against each other it is important that we as humans recognise our collective humanity and celebrate that,&quot; said Nandor.</p>
<p>&quot;I know that young people are thinking about these issues and I am hoping they will go a step further and express what they feel it means to be human at this time.&quot;</p>
<p>The winner of the competition and two of their friends will win lunch with Nandor at a place of their choice (Nandor is paying) and a prize pack featuring New Zealand music, writing and a range of other things that have not yet been decided. (But they will be cool.)</p>
<p>Nandor will display the most creative and original contributions in the Green Party offices.</p>
<p>Ends</p>
