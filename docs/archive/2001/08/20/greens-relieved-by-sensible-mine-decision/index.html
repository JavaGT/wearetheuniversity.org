<p>Green Party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons today said she was relieved that Conservation Minister Sandra Lee has turned down an application for an extension to a West Coast Gold mine on the Conservation estate.</p>
<p>The application by GRD Macraes to expand to 260 hectares an open cast gold mine with a 36 hectare tailings dam for toxic waste in the Victoria Conservation Park near Reefton was declined last night.</p>
<p>&quot;While we recognise that this is a courageous decision when so many are pushing for more extractive industries on the Coast, we believe it is entirely consistent with the Conservation Act and we are glad to see a Minister giving the Act the teeth it was always meant to have,&quot; said Ms Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>Since the initial consent was given for a much smaller operation in 1993 this is the third time the company has sought to vary the conditions, each time wanting more, while the original consent has never been implemented.</p>
<p>&quot;This sort of incrementalism has got to be stopped somewhere and we are glad it has been stopped here,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the unstable geography of the proposed site - including 12 active faults within 50 kilometres of the site - and high annual rainfall of 2.2 metres per annum - an approval for this mine would have been an unacceptable risk.</p>
<p>&quot;If the tailings dam had slipped, the Inanguhua and Buller rivers would have been exposed to risk of serious pollution from a range of heavy metals,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;The loss of habitat for robins, kakariki, kaka and kereru which are no longer abundant is also unacceptable.</p>

<p>&quot;The Greens have been watching this decision with a great deal of interest. Having seen first hand the problems of a slipping tailings dam in my Coromandel electorate I am really pleased and relieved that this Government have put the long-term health of the environment and ecosystems above short-term economic interests,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;The challenge for this Government is to provide real, long-term jobs which are sustainable and protect the environment. This application did neither of these things,&quot; said Ms Fitzsimons.</p>
