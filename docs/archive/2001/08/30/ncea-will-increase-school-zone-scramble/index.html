<p><strong>Thursday, 30 August 2001, 4:39 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesperson Gerry Brownlee says the school-zone scramble will only get worse when the National Certificate of Educational Achievement is introduced next year.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s Christchurch Press reported a noticeable upsurge in buyers asking for in-zone homes. This mirrors trends in other areas of New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents want what&#39;s best for their children. The number of parents moving house so their children can be in-zone for the school perceived to be the best in town will only increase once they become wise to the failings of the NCEA.</p>
<p>&quot;A excellent or merit grade in the NCEA will be worth more at one school than another. Universities will know it. Employers will know it. Parents will know and won&#39;t want their children to receive substandard qualifications.</p>
<p>&quot;Teachers and Principals have big concerns about the moderation system for the NCEA. Training days are already revealing stark differences between marks given by teachers to the same student&#39;s work,&quot; Mr Brownlee said.</p>
