<p>Northland students in years 12 and 13 are invited to Check out the Attitude at Albany campus of Massey University on Information Day, Friday, 17 August from 10 to 2pm.</p>
<p>To encourage students from Whangarei and further north to visit Albany, their closet university, information day organisers will give $20 petrol vouchers to students who carpool in a group of four or five.</p>
<p>Events on the day includeChannel Z’s James Coleman, Nathan Rarere and Jon Bridges debating a Massey team in a bout MCed by Bomber, live bands, free sausage sizzles, a prize draw for a 34cm colour television and giveaways are all part of the information day where students can explore course options at Massey University and discuss career outcomes and opportunities.</p>
<p>Lecturers from Massey’s Colleges of sciences, business, education, humanities and social sciences will be out in force with lively tasters of their courses and interactive displays.</p>
<p>Food technologists will help students to make their own candyfloss as well as offering the chance to “can” food and check out a display of the nasties that grow in your fridge in ‘The Good, The Bug and the Ugly’.</p>
<p>The nutritionists will ask “Can your body take it?” by finding out students’ height and weight and estimating their capacity to tolerate alcohol. The information scientists will display the Massey robot that can identify and sort different coloured balls and display bodyworks software for ergonomic products.</p>
<p>A non-stop choice of interesting talks on various subjects offered at Albany will run in three lecture theatres and include ‘No Sex Please, We’re Sociologists,’ (Social Sciences) ‘Going Gothic’ (Humanities) the ‘Beginners’ Guide to American Football’ (Sport Business Management), ‘Dracula and Monkey Man do University’ (History), ‘A Mile High – the truth about Pilots’ (Aviation) and others.</p>
<p>Student liaison adviser Deb Buchanan said the information day is about trying out new things and getting a feel for what Albany is all about.</p>
<p>“This is a fun day and a great chance to students to get to know about all the different courses and career options there are here at Massey Albanym” Ms Buchanan said.</p>
<p>“The Albany campus is New Zealand’s northern most university environment; it is modern, purpose built and most importantly it is personal.</p>
<p>“We now have more than 4000 students but we have not lost our level of personal concern for student welfare and successful study. We welcome students from the Northland area who are considering going to university, to come in and identify the advantages that study with us offers.”</p>
