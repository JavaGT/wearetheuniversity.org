<p><strong>Thursday, 2 August 2001, 4:28 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader, Rt Hon Winston Peters has released evidence showing that the Government intends to spend $831,000 on the ‘Maori-made’ logo.</p>
<p>An answer to a written question Judith Tizard said that The Government has already spent over $570,000, including $100,000 for two huis, $35,000 for legal fees and $150,000 for promotional materials. It also plans to spend $350,000 per annum to renew the logo.</p>
<p>“This is Political Correctness on a gross scale. At a time when schools and hospitals are being asked to tighten their belts the Government has spent this obscene amount on a logo that will do nothing to improve the lot of Maori, “ said Mr Peters.</p>
<p>“ The amount spent is made even more bitter by the fact that recent legislation means the copyright for the logo will not be able to be enforced anyway.</p>
<p>“ I am calling on the Prime Minister, who is also Minister of Arts and Culture to veto this wreckless spending.</p>
<p>“When Labour was last in power they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a ‘Miha’ label that had all the levitation of a lead balloon,” concluded Mr Peters.</p>
