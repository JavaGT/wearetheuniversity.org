<p>New Supercomputer To Power Leading University Research</p>
<p>The University of Auckland is to buy a supercomputer from IBM that will be the most powerful in New Zealand and will give its researchers the computing muscle necessary to stay at the forefront of global research efforts.</p>
<p>Users will include the bioengineering team lead by Professor Peter Hunter working to create a &#39;virtual body&#39;, the bioinformatics initiative led by Prof John Fraser of the Department of Molecular Medicine, and the theoretical chemistry research of Prof Peter Schwerdtfeger of the Department of Chemistry.</p>
<p>The purchase has come about through a strategic alliance announced today in the United States between IBM Global Services and Physiome Sciences, a New York based firm that collaborates with The University of Auckland&#39;s bioengineering team.</p>
<p>IBM and Physiome Sciences have entered into a broad strategic collaboration to develop and deploy software and hardware to enhance biological modelling for drug discovery.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, The University of Auckland will purchase one of IBM&#39;s new eServer* POWER4-based supercomputer. The supercomputer is the Regatta H, 32 Processor with 32 Gigabytes of operating memory.</p>
<p>Professor Peter Hunter, leader of the bioengineering research group in The University of Auckland&#39;s School of Engineering, said the supercomputer will be the most powerful in New Zealand and a real asset for The University of Auckland&#39;s research community.</p>
<p>&quot;Biomedical engineering industries are making a major contribution to the economies of most industrialised nations. We have a centre of excellence here in Auckland. This investment by the university and IBM will allow us to build on that strength for the benefit of all New Zealanders.&quot;</p>

<p>The bioengineering has developed the world&#39;s first accurate computer model of a human heart that behaves like a human heart when subjected to chemical or electrical changes, drugs or other influences.</p>
<p>&quot;The potential applications of this research are enormous,&quot; Professor Hunter said. &quot;Our collaboration with Physiome Sciences has helped bring this technology into use to streamline the process by which new drugs are developed. A model for human lungs is also being developed.</p>
<p>&quot;Now with the assistance of a New Economy Research Fund grant from the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology, the bioengineering team will build a database of every muscle, bone and ligament in the body, with a particular emphasis on understanding and modelling the function of the knee.&quot;</p>
<p>The supercomputer will be installed by the end of the year. The financial terms of the deal will not be disclosed.</p>
