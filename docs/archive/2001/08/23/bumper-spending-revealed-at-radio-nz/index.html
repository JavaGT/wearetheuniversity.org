<p><strong>Thursday, 23 August 2001, 11:02 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National MP Murray McCully is questioning the use of a promotional bumper sticker to advertise the non-commercial National Radio and Concert FM radio stations.</p>
<p>Mr McCully says some tens of thousands of taxpayer funds is being spent printing the bumper stickers and many thousands more on distributing them as inserts in the NZ Herald and AA Directions Magazine amongst others.</p>
<p>&quot;National Radio and Concert FM are given over $20 million of taxpayer funding each year. These funds are provided for programming, not to run promotional campaigns. Promotional campaigns are the preserve of commercial stations competing for ratings and for advertising dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;It is ironic that Radio NZ is spending taxpayers money on advertising when they receive that taxpayers money to compensate for being a commercial-free station!</p>
<p>&quot;Radio NZ staff have been striking demanding more pay. Radio NZ claims it doesn&#39;t have the funds yet it&#39;s frittering away tens of thousands of dollars on bumper stickers that will end up in rubbish bins.</p>
<p>&quot;This spending spree suggests that Radio NZ is being given more money than it needs for programming purposes. The Broadcasting Minister clearly needs to ask for a refund,&quot; Mr McCully said.</p>
