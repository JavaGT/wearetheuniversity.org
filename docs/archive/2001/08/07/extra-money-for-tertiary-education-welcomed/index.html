<p>Extra Money for Tertiary Education Welcomed</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s announcement that it will invest an additional $35m in tertiary education next year has been welcomed by student representatives at Victoria University, who will now be pushing for their university council to accept the Government&#39;s fee freeze offer.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been very concerned about the potential impact of accepting the fee freeze offer, especially at a time when our University will come under increased financial pressure in order to adapt to the changing tertiary environment,&quot; Chris Hipkins, President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students&#39; Association said today.</p>
<p>&quot;However, given that the government are now promising a long overdue cash injection, and coupled with the fact that Victoria has had a generous growth in enrolments this year, I am now confident that the University can afford to accept the fee freeze deal,&quot; Mr. Hipkins said.</p>
<p>&quot;If we decline the fee freeze offer, fees at Victoria could increase by up to $700 per student in order to compensate for a drop in government funding and a potential drop in enrolments. That would be totally unacceptable,&quot; Mr. Hipkins said.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re very pleased that the Government has seen the light and pledged to invest extra money next year. I would urge the Government not to see this extra investment as a one-off, but the start of a major re-investment in tertiary education in New Zealand,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have a long way to go before we can claim to have rebuilt our tertiary sector to a world class standard, but every step along the way is progress that should be acknowledged,&quot; Mr. Hipkins said.</p>

<p>&quot;The creation of a one-off fund for next year allows the Government to re-consider how that money will be allocated next year, and we would urge the Government to use that as an opportunity to increase the base-funding for tertiary institutions when it implements the new funding model currently being devised by TEAC,&quot; Mr. Hipkins concluded.</p>
