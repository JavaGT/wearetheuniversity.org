<p>Extra Tertiary Funding Must Mean No Fee Rises</p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students&#39; Association is calling on tertiary institutions to accept the government&#39;s fee freeze offer in light of today&#39;s announcement that extra funding is being provided to the sector with the establishment of the Transition Tertiary Education Commission (TEC).</p>
<p>&quot;Universities really have no other choice but to accept the fee freeze deal given that extra money is going to be available from July 2002. If they don&#39;t they will be over-riding the wishes of not only the government and students but also the wider community,&quot; said NZUSA Co-President Andrew Campbell.</p>
<p>NZUSA has argued throughout the 1990s that tertiary fees are keeping many people away from study. The Knowledge Wave Conference last week prioritised access to tertiary education. &quot;The government has met a part of the bargain - now universities have to meet their commitments and freeze or lower fees.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly the tertiary sector needs a lot more money to ensure free access and to improve quality. However if institutions do not accept this offer they will have a hard time justifying to the public and students why the 2.6% increase in funding offered in the budget plus this additional $35 million announced today is not enough to ensure fees are frozen,&quot; said Campbell.</p>
<p>&quot;The TEC has a big job ahead in steering the reforms to the tertiary sector. If institutions won&#39;t co-operate their job will be even harder,&quot; said Campbell. &quot;NZUSA believes that the only way for the government to avoid the problems experienced this year with fee stabilisation is to change legislation so institutions can&#39;t raise fees whenever they like.&quot;</p>
