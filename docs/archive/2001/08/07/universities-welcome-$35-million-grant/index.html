<p>Universities welcome $35 million grant to facilitate tertiary sector change</p>
<p>Massey University Vice-Chancellor Professor James McWha says the Government’s decision to give tertiary institutions a total of $35 million to help with the change process is obviously very good news.</p>
<p>Professor McWha is also chair of the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’ Committee.</p>
<p>The money will be distributed from a Tertiary Strategic Change Fund, administered by the Tertiary Education Commission. It will support initiatives taken by tertiary institutions individually or collectively, to adapt during the establishment of the Tertiary Education Commission and ahead of the implementation of a new funding and regulatory system.</p>
<p>Professor James McWha says the money recognises that universities are in a period of great change and facing rising costs. “The establishment of the fund recognises that we will need help to meet next year’s costs as well as those involved in a changing environment. It acknowledges the challenges and problems facing the university sector.”</p>
<p>He said the universities are also pleased and reassured that they have been able to reach an understanding with the Government on the future direction of funding. However no further details of that understanding were expected to be announced at this stage.</p>
