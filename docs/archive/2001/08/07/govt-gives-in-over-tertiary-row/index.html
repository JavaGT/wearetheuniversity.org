<p><strong>Tuesday, 7 August 2001, 4:54 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National&#39;s spokesman on Tertiary Education Maurice Williamson says the Government&#39;s $35 million package for tertiary institutions is &quot;a face saving gesture&quot; which does nothing to address the real problems afflicting the tertiary sector.</p>
<p>&quot;At Budget time Dr Cullen stood firm, saying the 2.6% increase was a final offer with no room for negotiation, and that tertiary institutions could take it or leave it.</p>
<p>&quot;However with the August 31 deadline looming, and the tertiary sector showing no sign of giving in, Dr Cullen&#39;s knees have turned to jelly.</p>
<p>&quot;$35 million has magically appeared to assist in the transition to the new environment created by TEAC. What makes that doubly laughable is that no-one even knows what the environment is - there is still no clear understanding how the new system will operate.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a sweetener, pure and simple. The Government is attempting to save face by capitulating without admitting it in so many words.</p>
<p>&quot;This money may serve to keep tertiary institutions quiet for now, but it does nothing to improve the quality of education and will have a minimal impact on student debt, which is growing at an ever increasingly alarming rate under this Labour Government.</p>
<p>&quot;What this shows is that Steve Maharey doesn&#39;t have a clue in his head about how to address the real issues. He&#39;s stumbling along in the moment, buying his way out of conflicts, while failing to do anything which will improve things long-term for those working or studying in the tertiary sector,&quot; Maurice Williamson said.</p>
