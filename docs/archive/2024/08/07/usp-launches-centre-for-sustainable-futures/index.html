<p>The University of the South Pacific (USP) is proud to announce the launch of the new USP Centre for Sustainable Futures, a central hub for climate change research and collaboration.</p>
<p>With initial funding support from the Aotearoa New Zealand International Climate Finance Strategy, the regional hub is designed to be sustainable to ensure its long-term impact on Pacific Island countries.</p>
<p>USP Vice-Chancellor and President, Professor Pal Ahluwalia said the institution recognised the urgent need to encourage collaboration and consolidate expertise in climate change research, policy and leadership.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For us in the Pacific, climate change is more than the greatest challenge of our time. For us, the threat goes beyond that. The loss of our villages and our islands leads to the demise of our cultures, our identities, indeed our <em>mana</em>,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“For all the challenges we face, the Pacific has always known that our remarkable strength and resilience lie in our capability to come together. And in its essence that is what USP is – a place where we can all work together to drive change.”</p>
<p>Professor Ahluwalia added that the Centre will create a multi-disciplinary, integrated, and strategic approach to climate change and resilience.</p>

<p>“Having a sustainable Pacific future means increased research capacity, in-depth impact studies, capacity-building initiatives, academic programmes, community-centred policies, and climate finance strategies benefitting the whole region.”</p>
<p>“The Centre will strengthen USP’s core role as a traditional university, researching to create and disseminate new knowledge through teaching, training, and publications. This will result in an increased number of current and future Pacific climate change researchers, policymakers, and legislators.”</p>
<p>“These leaders will then be equipped to lead their communities in addressing the challenges of climate change and its impacts.”</p>
<p>The Centre will be operational in the coming months.</p>
