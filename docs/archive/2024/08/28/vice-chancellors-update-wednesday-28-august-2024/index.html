<p>Mānawa Mai Open Day
On Saturday we welcomed more than 11,000 potential students and their whānau onto our campuses for Mānawa Mai Open Day; it was a wonderful occasion despite some wet weather. My thanks and congratulations to the 1,200 staff and 200 students whose contributions made the day possible.</p>
<p>Financial update
One of the key topics at this week’s meeting of Council related to the financial pressures currently faced by the sector and the University. Read more on our Notice pages.<a href="https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/news-events-and-notices/notices/notices-2024/quarter-3/financial-update-august-2024.html">https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/news-events-and-notices/notices/notices-2024/quarter-3/financial-update-august-2024.html</a> Given our relatively strong financial position overall, and the University’s proven responsiveness and ability to take early action, we have been developing plans that will be worked through over the next 18 months to ensure that we address these financial pressures strategically, rather than being forced into taking precipitous action.</p>
<p>Creating our Pacific Strategy
Work has begun on developing the University’s inaugural Pacific Strategy. Under the leadership of the Pro Vice-Chancellor Pacific, Professor Jemaima Tiatia-Siau, a project team has been formed to craft a transformational 5-year strategy that brings to life our commitment, as outlined in Taumata Teitei, to our Pacific students, staff, and their families and communities.</p>
<p>Farewell to John Hosking, Dean of Science
The time has come to bid farewell to Professor John Hosking, who will retire as Dean of Science on Friday 6 September. Over the past ten years, John has provided exceptional leadership as Dean of Science, advancing the faculty’s achievements and reputation while inspiring countless students. He has expertly balanced the demands of leading a comprehensive faculty while excelling in his research work. I want to acknowledge and thank John for his outstanding contributions and wish him all the best in his well-earned retirement. Professor Sarah Young, who joins us in October, will succeed John as Dean of Science.</p>
