<p>Recently we welcomed a wonderful new addition to the City Campus, the Tūtahi Tonu wharenui in B113, which has officially re-opened and been gifted a new name, Ngā Tauira marae, by Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei. Previously located at Epsom Campus, the marae recognises the rich history of the Faculty of Education and Social Work and provides additional cultural spaces for teaching and learning and in supporting staff and students to come together.
