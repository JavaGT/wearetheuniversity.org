<p>Frequently asked questions in relation to the new faculty arrangements.</p>
<p>Updated Friday 30 August 2024</p>
<h3>What is happening to my faculty?</h3>
<p>The University is restructuring its faculties to enhance collaboration and improve academic offerings. This means that some faculties are being combined, and new leadership structures are being introduced to better support students and staff.</p>
<p><sup>Added 30 August</sup></p>
<h3>Why is it necessary to create a new faculty?</h3>
<p>The new faculty brings together the combined strengths of the Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Education and Social Work, and the Elam School of Fine Arts, School of Music, and Dance Programme. This enhances collaboration, provides greater scale to withstand external challenges, enables synergies among related disciplines, and lowers internal barriers to interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary teaching and research. It also increases strategic capacity, allowing us to stay ahead in a constantly evolving tertiary environment.</p>
<p>This shift will also see the School of Architecture and Planning and the Design Programme become part of the Faculty of Engineering, which enables leveraging the unique strengths and perspectives of these disciplines.</p>
<h3>Why is the change necessary?</h3>
<p>The tertiary landscape is constantly evolving, and the new faculty arrangements will enable us to break down barriers, offer students access to a broader range of courses and subjects, and unlock research opportunities. Acting now allows us to proactively address challenges of scale and resilience, positioning ourselves for future success in a rapidly evolving educational landscape.</p>
<h3>What are the benefits of aligning the School of Architecture and Planning (SoAP) and the Design Programme with the Faculty of Engineering?</h3>
<p>Aligning SoAP and the Design Programme with the Faculty of Engineering could create new inter- or trans-disciplinary opportunities for students. This alignment could improve teaching and learning practices, such as studio/relational teaching and technical workshops, providing students with a more hands-on and integrated learning experience. Additionally, this alignment could lead to new research opportunities offering students the chance to engage in cutting-edge research projects.</p>
<h3>What are the benefits you think the new faculty arrangements will bring for students?</h3>
<p>The new faculty arrangements allow related areas to work together in ways that could enhance disciplines and programmes. Having access to courses within the same faculty could make it easier to design seamless curricula and improve access for students to a wider variety of courses and subjects. It provides the potential for a greater pool of supervisors available for doctoral and research masters candidates. Increased inter- and trans-disciplinary research potential for students across a range of disciplines will also be enabled.</p>
<h3>Will these changes affect my current course of study?</h3>
<p>The University is committed to ensuring that your studies are not disrupted. While there may be some changes in faculty organisation, it is anticipated that your degree requirements and the courses you need to complete your current programme will remain the same. These changes are not expected to impact your current course of study.  </p>
<h3>Will these changes affect my degree or courses?</h3>

These changes are not expected to impact your current course of study.</p>
<p><sup>Added 30 August</sup></p>
<h3>Will there be any changes to the courses or programmes offered?</h3>
<p>There are no anticipated changes to the courses or programmes offered in the short-term as a result of the new faculty arrangements. Programmes and courses often change to respond to the evolving needs of students, but such changes are not being considered as part of this work. In the future, the new faculty arrangements may lead to enhanced collaboration between aligned disciplines/programmes, which could potentially offer new inter- or trans-disciplinary learning opportunities for students.  </p>
<h3>How will these changes impact the faculty and staff in terms of job roles and responsibilities?</h3>
<p>While there may be some changes in how staff are organised within a new faculty arrangement, these changes should not impact the quality of education or services provided to students. While we cannot predict the precise outcomes at this early stage, we are committed to transparent communication and will provide updates as the process unfolds. Our primary goal is to future-proof our institution, ensuring we can continue to deliver world-class education and research opportunities for our students and staff.  </p>
<h3>Will there be any changes to the campus or facilities as a result of these changes?</h3>
<p>There are no planned changes to the campus or facilities as a result of the new faculty arrangements. All campus facilities will continue to be available to students as usual. What we hope is that in the future a new faculty arrangement would lead to enhanced and more easily accessible facilities or resources that benefit students and staff.</p>
<h3>How will these changes affect the availability of resources and support services for students?</h3>
<p>These changes are not expected to impact the current availability of resources and support services for students. We are committed to providing ongoing support to ensure your academic success. We envision that in the future, the new faculty structure may lead to improved access to resources and support services that enhance the overall student experience.  </p>
<h3>Will there be any changes to the curriculum or teaching methods?</h3>
<p>There are no planned changes to the curriculum or teaching methods as a result of the new faculty arrangements.</p>
<h3>How will these changes impact research opportunities for students?</h3>
<p>These changes won&#39;t affect the research opportunities students have right now. You&#39;ll still have opportunities to take part in research projects and other initiatives.</p>
<h3>How will the new structure improve access to subject specialists for students?</h3>
<p>The new faculty arrangements will improve access to a larger number of subject specialists within the larger, more integrated faculty. This would allow students to benefit from the expertise of a wider range of academic staff.</p>
<h3>Will there be any changes to the fees or costs associated with my education?</h3>
<p>There are no anticipated changes to fees or costs associated with your education as a result of these new faculty arrangements. However, please note that fees may be subject to periodic adjustments as part of normal University operations.</p>
<h3>Will there be any changes to student clubs, societies or extracurricular activities?</h3>
<p>While there are no planned changes to student clubs, societies or extracurricular activities as a result of these new faculty arrangements, discussions will be had with students/class reps on any synergies or opportunities to align clubs/societies. You can continue to participate in these activities as usual.</p>
<h3>Can I provide feedback on these changes?</h3>
<p>Although the formal consultation process is primarily for staff, the University values the student&#39;s voice. You are encouraged to share any concerns or questions with your faculty’s student representatives or through other appropriate channels such as <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/notices/2024/new-faculty-arrangements/student-faqs/student-association-president-list.html">student associations</a>.</p>
<p><sup>Added 30 August</sup></p>
<h3>How will I know if there are any changes to my programmes or courses?</h3>
<p>In the normal course of business, the University will communicate any significant changes directly to you via your student email and the student portal. It is not envisaged that there will be any immediate changes to your programmes or courses because of this restructure.</p>
<p><sup>Added 30 August</sup></p>
<h3>Are there any new opportunities or resources being introduced as part of these changes?</h3>
<p>The restructuring aims to create a more collaborative and innovative academic environment. This could lead to new opportunities in interdisciplinary studies, research, and access to enhanced resources within the newly formed faculties.</p>
