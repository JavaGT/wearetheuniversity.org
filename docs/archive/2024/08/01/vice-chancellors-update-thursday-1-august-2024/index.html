<p>Dean appointed for new faculty
I am delighted to announce that Professor Nuala Gregory has been appointed Dean of the new faculty that combines Arts, Education and Social Work with parts of Creative Arts and Industries. An artist and academic, Professor Gregory’s career spans 27 years of service at the University in various roles, including her current position as Dean of CAI, which she has held since 2022.</p>
<p>Professor Gregory will commence in her new position on Monday 5 August, and will lead the establishment of the new faculty, including building an identity that encompasses the proud culture and heritage of the current faculties. Her leadership will undoubtedly contribute to the new faculty’s stability, collegiality and success.

<p>New policies to address harmful sexual behaviours and staff-student relationships
The University has published two important policies as part of the Creating Cultures of Consent and Respect Action Plan<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/students/student-support/personal-support/be-well/harmful-sexual-behaviours/harmful-sexual-behaviours-action-plan/about-the-action-plan0.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/students/student-support/personal-support/be-well/harmful-sexual-behaviours/harmful-sexual-behaviours-action-plan/about-the-action-plan0.html</a>. These policies work with our existing Bullying, Harassment, and Discrimination Policy.</p>
<p>The Harmful Sexual Behaviours Policy and Intimate Relationships between Staff Members and Students Policy &amp; Procedures and Guidelines are informed by feedback from university-wide consultation in late 2022. Our priority is to create a safe environment where staff and students feel supported in speaking out about sexual harm.

<p>Sir Colin Maiden (5 May 1933 – 31 July 2024)
It is with great sadness that we learned of Sir Colin Maiden’s death earlier this week. Sir Colin had a longstanding connection to the University, having been a student, staff member and Vice-Chancellor from 1971-1994. He championed improved facilities for an ever-increasing student population during his tenure, leading to significant changes, including a building programme that transformed the campus and facilities. Our deepest condolences go to his family from the University community.</p>
<p>August all-staff forum
The next all-staff forum will be held on Wednesday 28 August from 12-1pm. This meeting will also double as the online Town Hall event postponed in early July.</p>
