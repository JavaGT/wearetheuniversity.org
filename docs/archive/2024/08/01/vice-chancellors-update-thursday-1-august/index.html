<p>Kia ora tātou,</p>
<p>Dean appointed to new faculty</p>
<p>I am delighted to announce that Professor Nuala Gregory has been appointed Dean
of the new faculty that combines Arts, Education and Social Work with parts of
Creative Arts and Industries. An artist and academic, Professor Gregory&#39;s career
spans 27 years of service at the University in various roles, including her
current position as Dean of CAI, which she has held since 2022.</p>
<p>Professor Gregory will commence in her new position on Monday 5 August, and will
lead the establishment of the new faculty, including building an identity that
encompasses the proud culture and heritage of the current faculties. Her
leadership will undoubtedly contribute to the new faculty&#39;s stability,
collegiality and sucess. Find out more on our News pages

<p>New policies to address harmful sexual behaviours and staff-student
relationships</p>
<p>The University has published two important policies as part of the Creating
Cultures of Consent and Respect Action Plan
[<a href="https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvN_~wqCDv8S~xb~Gv_U~yK_laoqdR37ufTvSz7~Pv8m&2=41436%5D">https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvN_~wqCDv8S~xb~Gv_U~yK_laoqdR37ufTvSz7~Pv8m&amp;2=41436]</a>.
These policies with our existing Bullying, Harassment, and Discrimination
Policy.</p>
<p>The Harmful Sexual Behaviours Policy and Intimate Relationships between Staff
Members and Students Policy &amp; Procedures and Guidelines are informed by feedback
from university-wide consultation in late 2022. Our priority is to create a safe
environment where staff and students feel supported in speaking out about sexual
harm. Read more on the Notice page

<p>Sir Colin Maiden (5 May 1933 - 31 July 2024)</p>
<p>It is with great sadness that we learned of Sir Colin Maiden&#39;s death earlier
this week. Sir Colin had a longstanding connection to the University, having
been a student, staff member and Vice-Chancellor from 1971-1994. He championed
improved facilities for an ever-increasing student population during his tenure,
leading to significant changes, including a building programme that transformed
the campus and facilities. Our deepest condolences go out to his family from the
University community.</p>
<p>Ngā mihi nui,</p>
<p>Dawn</p>
<p>Professor Dawn Freshwater
