It Is Cultural Indoctrination</h1>
<p><strong>Tuesday, 7 May 2024, 1:53 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>A senior, highly respected King’s Counsel with decades of experience in our law courts, Gary Judd KC, has filed a complaint about compulsory tikanga Māori studies for law students - highlighting the utter depths of absurdity this woke cultural madness has taken our society.</p>
<p>The tikanga regulations will compel law students to be taught that a system, which does not conform with the rule of law, is nevertheless law which should be observed and applied.</p>
<p>As Judd KC points out in his complaint - tikanga is not law.</p>
<p>Law students should not be force fed this kind of woke indoctrination from some culture warrior’s slanted version of what tikanga means.</p>
<p>What is most concerning is the Dean of the AUT Law School, Kylee Quince, funded by the taxpayer, decided to typically stoop to a gutter level and call Judd an ‘old racist dinosaur’ who should ‘die quietly in the corner’.</p>
<p>This is from someone who is in charge of teaching our law students.</p>
<p>How has this kind of insipid, cancerous, woke indoctrination taken a hold within our education system?</p>
<p>Judd KC pointed out what is written in law, and the ridiculous compulsion to indoctrinate students with irrelevant cultural interpretations having no reason being part of a law degree.</p>
<p>Someone in Quince’s position, with this septic and out of touch modus operandi, raises the question of the proper use of taxpayer funding.</p>
<p>She does not represent New Zealand or what we expect in our tertiary institutions.</p>
