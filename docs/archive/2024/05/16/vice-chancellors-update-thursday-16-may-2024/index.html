<p>It was inspiring to see almost 7,000 students graduate and celebrate their achievements with their whānau at the recent Autumn graduations. Congratulations to all our graduates and sincere thanks to the academic and professional staff who have supported those students throughout their journey at the University. Thank you also to those who made it possible to hold dedicated ceremonies for each faculty this year. You can read more about the graduates and their stories on the Graduation news page<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/list.html?tag=news:graduation">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/list.html?tag=news:graduation</a>.</p>
<p>University reviews meeting</p>
<p>Professor Sir Peter Gluckman held an online meeting this morning for all staff to discuss the role of the University Advisory Group (UAG) and the Science System Advisory Group (SSAG). The government established the two groups to provide advice on the future of the New Zealand university system and how to strengthen the science, innovation and technology system.</p>

<p>University Town Halls, 8-12 July</p>
<p>This year&#39;s Town Hall staff meetings will take place from Monday 8 July to Friday 12 July across various campus locations. As in previous years, these open conversations are not faculty-specific, and you are free to attend whichever meeting is most convenient for you. The 12 July meeting will be online and will replace the Wednesday 31 July all-staff Zoom forum. I look forward to seeing you there.
