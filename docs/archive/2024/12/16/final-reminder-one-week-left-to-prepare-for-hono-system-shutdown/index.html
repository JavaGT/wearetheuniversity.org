<p>This week is your last chance to complete key HR actions in preparation for the Hono| Human Connections system shutdown from 8am Monday 6 January 2025.</p>

<li><p>Forecasted casual staff hours for the timesheet period Monday 6 January to Sunday 2 February 2025 must be submitted and approved no later than Sunday 5 January 2025.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An interim online timesheet portal has been created to record actual hours worked versus forecasted hours during shutdown. Details will be sent soon.
Leave</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ensure that unsubmitted used leave is entered and approved.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Submit requests for any leave you plan to take during the system shutdown period by Sunday 5 January 2025.</p>

<p>Payslips
Download any payslips you require as you will not be able to download these during shutdown.</p>
<p>Variations
Managers must ensure all fixed-term contracts due to end during the shutdown period are extended where required.</p>
<p>Onboarding
Managers, work closely with new hires and ensure onboarding is complete by Sunday 5 January 2025. Failure to meet this deadline will impact our ability to forecast the new employee’s pay during the system shutdown.</p>

Any expected changes to salary earnings distributions and other known people-related costs should be urgently communicated to your Finance Business Partners.</p>
