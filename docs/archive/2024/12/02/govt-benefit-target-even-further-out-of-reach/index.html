<p><strong>Monday, 2 December 2024, 5:30 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Christopher Luxon has once again failed to read the room and claimed success while life gets harder for everyday Kiwis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The health system is in crisis, rates are up, race relations are going backwards, and a New Zealander leaves the country seeking better opportunities overseas every 6 and a half minutes,” Labour spokesperson for Social Development Carmel Sepuloni said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Despite Minister for Social Development Louise Upston’s pledge to reduce Jobseeker numbers by 50,000, the number of beneficiaries has risen by over 22,000 – meaning their target is effectively now 72,000.</p>
<p>“With the Minister now covering up her tracks by removing weekly benefit reporting, the latest beneficiary numbers may be even higher than she’s let us in on.</p>
<p>“Louise Upston is removing access to hardship assistance payments like food grants, for people who received a non-financial sanction, and access to emergency housing has been made more difficult. Tightening the guidelines and moving the goalposts is not a victory to claim, it is an abomination.</p>
<p>“Not only is this Government ineffective, but it is also cruel and punishing to people who are suffering because of this Government’s fiscal vandalism.</p>
<p>“Unemployment is at a four-year high and is forecast to continue to rise. The labour market is becoming weaker, so beneficiaries will likely grow further.</p>
<p>“Thousands of jobs have been lost because of this Government’s reckless choices. To then clamp down on those who end up on a benefit is heartless.</p>
<p>“Louise Upston should read the room and make a difference instead of making the lives of vulnerable people more difficult for no gain,” Carmel Sepuloni said.</p>
