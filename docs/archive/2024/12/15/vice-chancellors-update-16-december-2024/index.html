<p>As we conclude the year and prepare for the festive season, I would like to extend once more my sincere gratitude for all your efforts on behalf of our University. Looking ahead, we know that 2025 will bring both opportunities and some uncertainties. Nevertheless, I am confident in our abilities to lead and respond to the increasing complexity of our environment.</p>
<p>Graduations
The Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences celebrated the success of nearly 750 students in the fields of health and medicine during graduations last week. Congratulations to all the graduates and to the staff who have supported them in reaching this milestone.

<p>Future executive structure
As I recently indicated, I will be reviewing the leadership structure and the organisation of the leadership teams’ committees and meetings in the New Year. I hope these will be in place for March 2025.</p>
<p>In the brief interim period, and until new arrangements are finalised, the faculty deans will report to the Vice-Chancellor, and the remaining direct reports of the Provost will report to an interim role of Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Ed) for up to six months January-June 2025. I have asked Professor Simon Holdaway to hold this position while the new structure and any resultant appointments are finalised.</p>
<p>Our Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research &amp; Innovation Professor Frank Bloomfield has also been in the process of making appointments to the refreshed Research and Innovation portfolio as part of horizon two of Taumata Teitei.</p>
<p>The internal expression of interest process for two of the Pro Vice-Chancellor roles is complete:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professor JR Rowland (currently Deputy Dean Science) has been appointed Pro Vice-Chancellor Global and Graduate Research.</li>
<li>Professor Simon Holdaway has been appointed Pro Vice-Chancellor Research Performance and Reputation. (Simon will be seconded to the interim Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Ed) role from 1 January for six months).</li>
</ul>
<p>Short-listing for the position of CEO of UniServices and Pro Vice-Chancellor (Innovation &amp; Enterprise) took place last Friday 13 December, with interviews to be scheduled for the new year.</p>
<p>I would also like to confirm that, following an internal expression of interest process, Professor Jaime King will fill the role of interim Dean of Law for six months.</p>
<p>HR system shutdown notice
In preparation for the launch of Hono | Human Connections on Monday 10 February, HR systems will shut down from Monday 6 January to Sunday 9 February.
