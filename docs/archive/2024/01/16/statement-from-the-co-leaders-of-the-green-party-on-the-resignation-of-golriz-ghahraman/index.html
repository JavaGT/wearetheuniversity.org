<p>Green Party Co-leaders Marama Davidson and James Shaw said:</p>
<p>“Golriz Ghahraman has been the leading voice in Parliament for human rights, truly independent foreign policy, and electoral reform for six years. Her political achievements are significant.</p>
<p>“Green MPs are expected to maintain high standards of public behaviour.</p>
<p>“It is clear to us that Ms Ghahraman is in a state of extreme distress. She has taken responsibility and apologised. We support the decision she has made to resign.</p>
<p>“We are deeply sorry to see Ms Ghahraman leave under these circumstances and we wish her all the best for the future.</p>
<p>“Ms Ghahraman has worked tirelessly on behalf of her communities. Nothing detracts from that work and we know she will continue to support those communities in the future.</p>
<p>“We cannot comment on the details of allegations while Police investigations are ongoing.</p>
<p>“The Green Party is a movement of thousands of people working for people and planet and that work continues.”</p>
