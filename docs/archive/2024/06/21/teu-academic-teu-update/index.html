<p>BARGAINING 2024. It is time again to negotiate collective bargaining. There are some exciting claims proposed this year to take to the employer. Starting next week, you get to vote on these. We are holding claims endorsement meetings, for you to hear about and vote on the proposed claims and from the bargaining teams.</p>
<p>You should have received invitations to the meetings below. If not, please email <a href="mailto:lucy.fowler@teu.ac.nz">lucy.fowler@teu.ac.nz</a>.
We recommend coming to an in-person meeting if possible, so staff who work in remote campuses or overseas have space to ask questions in the zooms.

<p>The Bargaining Support Network held its first meeting in mid-June, and there are some key opportunities to contribute to the bargaining campaign without needing to be on the bargaining team! Are you a data master? A comms wizard? A creative thinker? Our group has three focuses, communications (including a TEU branch podcast), data research, and action. The work is member-driven and if you can help out in one of these three, areas let us know  by going here<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWzzo0IvLV735isVqSdHDugTOR7crzWli4rn-uoQiDncRQ6Q/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWzzo0IvLV735isVqSdHDugTOR7crzWli4rn-uoQiDncRQ6Q/viewform</a>.<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWzzo0IvLV735isVqSdHDugTOR7crzWli4rn-uoQiDncRQ6Q/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWzzo0IvLV735isVqSdHDugTOR7crzWli4rn-uoQiDncRQ6Q/viewform</a></p>
<p>The strength that our collective voice has in bargaining depends on our membership. This is the time you must each step forward and talk to your colleagues to get them to join the union. Only union members get to have input into bargaining, vote on offers to decide if your employer’s offer is good enough and if required take action to strengthen the offer. This is all about numbers. Please encourage your colleagues to join up: <a href="http://www.teu.ac.nz/join">www.teu.ac.nz/join</a><a href="http://www.teu.ac.nz/join">http://www.teu.ac.nz/join</a></p>
<p>EDSW Faculty restructure. The Branch will be giving feedback on this proposal. We have set up a google doc for affected members to enter you views for that feedback and to raise any questions. You should have received an email with that google doc link from  <a href="mailto:Nicole.Wallace@teu.ac.nz">Nicole.Wallace@teu.ac.nz</a>. We encourage affected members to also give their own individual and group feedback by 25 June midday.</p>
<p>Health, safety, and wellbeing. Last week we reported that we declined to immediately sign off on the ACC audit request, on account of the perceived gaps in wellbeing protections. We advised HR of this. We received a response on the same day, pointing out that an inability to audit would result in reversion to ACC coverage which is problematic in the current political environment (see, e.g., here<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/520003/acc-taken-to-court-as-claimants-lose-jobs-homes-while-waiting-for-disputes-to-be-reviewed">https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/520003/acc-taken-to-court-as-claimants-lose-jobs-homes-while-waiting-for-disputes-to-be-reviewed</a> and here<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/518563/acc-levies-may-increase-due-to-rise-in-serious-injuries-rehabilitation-costs">https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/518563/acc-levies-may-increase-due-to-rise-in-serious-injuries-rehabilitation-costs</a>). We signed but sought assurances that we will get answers to our questions this week re:</p>
<ul>
<li>the status of the bargaining-mandated, joint TEU-HR working group on workload and wellbeing;</li>
<li>TEU and wider staff involvement in policy development that affects our wellbeing; and</li>
<li>the collection and analysis of statistics on the broad range of factors that impact staff wellbeing, including but not limited to work-related stress and leave, threats, bullying, harassment, and discrimination.
We have also asked to meet with the ACC auditors when they are on campus to discuss.</li>
</ul>
<p>Academic freedom. This week the all-staff forum involved discussion on the draft academic freedom policy<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/notices/2024/draft-freedom-expression-academic-freedom-policy-consultation.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/notices/2024/draft-freedom-expression-academic-freedom-policy-consultation.html</a>. Peter Hunter, who led the Senate group that drafted the policy, participated and answered questions.  Not all conceivable questions were asked, and not all answers were definitive, so we encourage members to provide feedback to <a href="mailto:academicfreedom.consultation@auckland.ac.nz">academicfreedom.consultation@auckland.ac.nz</a>. Members are also welcome to share their reactions to the policy with us. Email me, in strict confidence.</p>
<p>TEU’s Academic Freedom Conference.  Members may also be interested in this conference to be held 19-20 September online. The call for abstracts is now open. Abstracts can be sent to <a href="mailto:jordyn.broughton@teu.ac.nz">jordyn.broughton@teu.ac.nz</a>. The peer review panel will accept individual abstracts or proposals for panels to be run on the topic of Academic Freedom. Abstracts are due by 5pm 22 July 2024.
The conference looks to examine the state of academic freedom in Aotearoa and ways in which staff and students can push back against attacks on academic freedom.

<p>Massey U’s intrusion into academic freedom. Clause 8 of the proposed Academic Freedom policy here states: “The exercise of academic freedom is also subject to the constraints imposed by the University by way of its reasonable requirements to:</p>
<ul>
<li>regulate the subject matter of courses taught at the University;</li>
<li>teach and assess students in the way that it considers best promotes learning…”
Massey U has begun to reveal how this might be done: <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/350317168/massey-academics-fear-loss-curriculum-ownership">https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/350317168/massey-academics-fear-loss-curriculum-ownership</a>, prompting some academic staff to raise concerns with how decisions about content and assessment could be taken away from them and be assumed by a qualification committee. TEU member Bryan Walpert said it was a worrying shift of autonomy away from experts: “I’m going to have to negotiate with a learning specialist about my content and my pedagogy. That’s outrageous.”</li>

<p>Safe spaces, dangerous talk. In March, a temporary sign identifying a space by Māori students and Pacific students was described by politicians as segregation, leading to abuse and death threats directed at students and staff.

<p>The return of paternalism? TEU member Kendra Cox (Education and Social Work) discusses the repeal of the bill repealing Oranga Tamariki&#39;s obligation to give effect to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.

<p>The mess that is Te Pūkenga. “Six months after ordering Te Pūkenga to stop work, the government has told it to resume cost-cutting and asset sales at its polytechnics…The Tertiary Education Union told RNZ the directive would create more stress and uncertainty for under-pressure staff.”  Te Pūkenga told to resume cost-cutting and asset sales | RNZ News<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/519830/te-pukenga-told-to-resume-cost-cutting-and-asset-sales">https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/519830/te-pukenga-told-to-resume-cost-cutting-and-asset-sales</a>.

<p>95 and still going… Noam Chomsky’s entire life has been “dedicated to insisting, and showing, that the essence of his project is something to which any decent person can aspire, and every single person in institutions of learning should take as not only an inspiration but a duty. It is highly unlikely that the credentialed professionals calling themselves intellectuals will ever engage in this task as a group. But it is not hard to see Chomsky’s influence on the emerging generation of activists today.” Let’s Celebrate Noam Chomsky, the Intellectual and Moral Giant <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/06/noam-chomsky-media-theory-elites">jacobin.com</a>. Incidentally, reports of his death in Brazil have been denied by his wife: Noam Chomsky&#39;s wife says reports of 95-year-old activist&#39;s death are false <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/newslondon/noam-chomskys-wife-says-reports-of-95-year-old-activists-death-are-false/ar-BB1ou7v3?ocid=BingNewsSerp">msn.com</a>.</p>

<li>Bargaining 101: What is Collective Bargaining? Collective Bargaining is the way that members, through their union representatives, negotiate their collective agreement with their employers to determine their pay, terms and conditions of employment. Terms of employment include things like hours of work, annual and sick leave and the way job progression works. In collective bargaining both union members and the employer bring claims to the other party of what changes they would like to see in the renewed collective agreement. You can find the current Collective Agreements at Waipapa Taumata Rau/ UoA at <a href="https://uoacollectiveagreements.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/collective-employment-agreements/">https://uoacollectiveagreements.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/collective-employment-agreements/</a><a href="https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/dYMtCzvk8xtyQ7XAh4etZU?domain=uoacollectiveagreements.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/">https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/dYMtCzvk8xtyQ7XAh4etZU?domain=uoacollectiveagreements.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/</a>.</li>
