<p>The asset National sold in Budget was Aotearoa&#39;s future.</p>
<p>Not only did this Government sink into borrowing to fund yesterday&#39;s Budget, but they sold off our greatest asset - Aotearoa&#39;s future generations. Hiked course fees, public transport costs, and weekly rents are the flagship commitments young Kiwis got from Nicola Willis.</p>
<p>This Budget will leave rangatahi of all backgrounds worse off. We&#39;re now on track to spend less on education as a GDP percentage than at any point in 50 years. That&#39;s the next generation of teachers, doctors, nurses who will have to borrow more with their first year free scrapped, while the quality of education they&#39;re paying for declines.</p>
<p>It is outrageous to heap the cost of inflation on students and their families through jacked-up fees. To give our full-time students a mere $2 a week in tax cuts at a time when their landlords are increasing rents is purely insulting. It doesn&#39;t cover the hikes to public transport or their prescription costs.</p>
<p>These decisions show the disdain this Government has for contributing young Kiwis. It&#39;s nothing but pocket change for students, beneficiaries and minimum-wage workers. All during a cost-of-living crisis. To go and slash transitional housing for rangatahi, gut school lunches, and make cuts to climate funding that accounts to billions and billions of dollars.</p>
<p>It lets down not just this generation of New Zealanders, but it sells short our future generations too.</p>
