<p>THE Impact Rankings 2024</p>
<p>We have additional positive rankings news to celebrate this week, maintaining our position as one of the world’s leading universities for impact. Ranked at 13 globally in the THE Impact Rankings 2024, we remain within the top 1 percent worldwide, despite a near 25 percent increase in entries this year. This outcome reflects our continued focus on integrating and enhancing sustainability across all we do.

<p>Universities and science system reviews</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who provided input into the Sir Peter Gluckman-led reviews into universities and the science system. The University of Auckland has submitted responses to both the Science System Advisory Group (SSAG) and the University Advisory Group (UAG). The UAG will provide an initial report to government in August 2024 and a final report in February 2025. The SSAG will develop a two-part report, with the first part delivered at the end of June, and the second at the end of October 2024. There will be opportunities to provide further input into both reviews ahead of the delivery of the final reports.</p>
