<p>Update on the proposed faculty arrangements
The University Council has approved the creation of a new Faculty, effective January 2025. It will combine the current Faculties of Education and Social Work (EDSW) and Arts, and the Fine Arts, Music and Dance disciplines in Creative Arts and Industries (CAI). The School of Architecture and Planning and the Design Programme will align with the Faculty of Engineering.</p>
<p>Over the next six months, work will begin to establish the new Faculty, retaining existing schools and academic units during the transition. A new Dean will be appointed to lead the new Faculty. Further details can be viewed in this Dean job listing<a href="https://smrtr.io/kWKYF">https://smrtr.io/kWKYF</a>. I want to thank the current Faculty Deans for their strategic leadership across their respective departments and the valuable contributions that colleagues have made throughout this process.</p>
