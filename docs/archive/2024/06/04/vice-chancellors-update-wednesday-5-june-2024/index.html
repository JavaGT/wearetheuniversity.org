<p>QS World University Rankings 2025
Following the announcement of the 2025 QS rankings, I am pleased to share that we have improved our ranking to be number 65 in the world, up from our 2024 ranking of 68. This is of particular note as it is our highest QS ranking to date and is an outstanding achievement in an increasingly competitive international field. We remain the highest ranked university in Aotearoa New Zealand and the only one in the top 100 globally. This result is testament to our commitment to excellence and the quality of our teaching, research and learning. I want to extend my profound thanks to you all for your dedication and hard work in achieving this exceptional outcome.

Thank you to everyone who provided feedback on this proposal. We received more than 400 constructive and insightful submissions. The Review Committee has carefully considered these and has provided its recommendations. These were also provided to Senate at its meeting on 27 May and will be considered by the University Council next week. Following the Council meeting I will advise of the final decision.</p>
