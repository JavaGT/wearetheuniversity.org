<p>The diversity of research interests of this year’s Georgetti Scholarship winners is clear evidence of the abundance of impactful research coming out of New Zealand’s universities.</p>
<p>From building rockets to early detection of ovarian cancer, the nine winners of the 2024 Georgetti Scholarship are the embodiment of William Georgetti’s wish that “the best brains available shall receive the benefit of this trust.”</p>
<p>The Scholarship, now in its 81st year, is one of New Zealand’s most prestigious graduate awards, offering exceptional students the opportunity to pursue post-graduate study either in New Zealand or overseas.</p>
<p>Universities New Zealand’s Scholarships Chair Professor Duncan McGillivray said, “Every year I am struck by the caliber of candidates interviewed and this year was no different. I am delighted to see these nine young scholars being recognised for their innovative and essential research that will have long-term benefits for Aotearoa New Zealand’s social, cultural and economic development.”</p>
<p>The 2024 scholarship winners are:</p>

<p><strong>Kate Hooper</strong>, aged 46, from Napier, has a Bachelor of Science and a Masters of Science (Hons First Class), both from the University of Waikato.
