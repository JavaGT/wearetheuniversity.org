<p>Make your contribution to our 2024 bargaining campaign. Your union has always been people-powered and runs on the diversity of experience, talents and interests of you and your fellow members. If you are willing to contribute to a successful bargaining process this year, you can do so without having to be a part of the bargaining team. A great way is to join the Bargaining Support Network. Please let us know that you are interested by going here<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWzzo0IvLV735isVqSdHDugTOR7crzWli4rn-uoQiDncRQ6Q/viewform?usp=sf_link">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWzzo0IvLV735isVqSdHDugTOR7crzWli4rn-uoQiDncRQ6Q/viewform?usp=sf_link</a>.</p>
<p>The strength that our collective voice has in bargaining depends on our membership. This is the time you must each step forward and talk to your colleagues to get them to join the union. Only union members get to have input into bargaining, vote on offers to decide if your employer’s offer is good enough and if required take action to strengthen the offer. This is all about numbers. Please encourage your colleagues to join up: <a href="http://www.teu.ac.nz/join">www.teu.ac.nz/join</a><a href="http://www.teu.ac.nz/join">http://www.teu.ac.nz/join</a></p>
<p>Faculty restructure.  We reported last week of a meeting called by the Dean of Education and Social Work (EDSW) in which the employer has proposed changes, resulting in 17.4 FTE of academic staff be cut to adjust the staff:student ratio, and net cuts to course offerings. The organisers hosted a meeting for members yesterday. Members raised a number of questions related to consultation timing, data accuracy, impact on Māori and Pacific staff, stakeholder input from outside the university, and many others. We have set up a google doc, for affected members to raise questions. Contact <a href="mailto:Nicole.Wallace@teu.ac.nz">Nicole.Wallace@teu.ac.nz</a> for details</p>
<p>Health, safety, and wellbeing. The university seeks to decrease its costs and improve outcomes for staff by using an organisation other than ACC (in this case, WellNZ) to manage injury-at-work claims.  Every year, however, ACC audits the university’s systems, record-keeping, and policymaking to ensure best practice. For the most part this is a system that works well, saves money, and results in safer, quicker returns to work (although we encourage members to report issues with this system). Conspicuous by its absence in any of the documents presented to HSW representatives (n~=100) this week is anything related to wellbeing, occupational health or similar topics. When asked, we were told that wellbeing is a project still in the “discovery phase”. Unfortunately, it has been in this phase (or its equivalent) for at least six years without evidence of progress.</p>
<p>A TEU representative is formally asked to co-sign the documentation that the University submits to ACC. In previous years, we have signed, in expectation that the wellbeing element would be developed. The branch committee, at its meeting on Wednesday, voted to decline to sign this document until we have a firm commitment of (1) a timeline and content for policies and procedures to protect and enhance staff wellbeing, and (2) resuscitation of the Workload and Wellbeing working group agreed to at bargaining 2019-20, and (3) the regular collection and presentation to HSW committee of deidentified information related to work-related stress leave, burnout, bullying, harassment, discrimination and related psychosocial harm. We have advised HR of this and await their response.</p>
<p>Academic freedom. Last week, the VC announced the Draft Freedom of Expression and Academic Freedom Policy - The University of Auckland<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/policy-hub/policy-development-review/documents-for-consultation/draft-freedom-of-expression-and-academic-freedom-policy.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/policy-hub/policy-development-review/documents-for-consultation/draft-freedom-of-expression-and-academic-freedom-policy.html</a>. It is open for staff and student consultation until 5pm on Friday 28 June. Next week, the all-staff forum will be moved to 12-1pm, Monday 17 June, to facilitate discussion on the draft policy<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/notices/2024/draft-freedom-expression-academic-freedom-policy-consultation.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/notices/2024/draft-freedom-expression-academic-freedom-policy-consultation.html</a>. Members of the Freedom of Expression and Academic Freedom Advisory Group will be present to provide an overview of the policy and answer your questions. We encourage our members to read and carefully consider the details of this policy, and to attend and ask questions at the forum.  We also encourage members to provide feedback to <a href="mailto:academicfreedom.consultation@auckland.ac.nz">academicfreedom.consultation@auckland.ac.nz</a>.

<p>UniSaver elections. The UniSaver election for the two member-appointed directors is currently running.  All members of UniSaver (join if you are eligible!) will have received an email with a link to vote. Unisaver manages over $1.5 billion of member funds so how they are invested is important. We encourage you to look closely at candidates’ commitment to environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices where UniSaver may have been lagging.</p>

<li>Bargaining 101: What is Collective Bargaining? Collective Bargaining is the way that members, through their union representatives, negotiate their collective agreement with their employers to determine their pay, terms and conditions of employment. Terms of employment include things like hours of work, annual and sick leave and the way job progression works. In collective bargaining both union members and the employer bring claims to the other party of what changes they would like to see in the renewed collective agreement. You can find the current Collective Agreements at Waipapa Taumata Rau/ UoA at <a href="https://uoacollectiveagreements.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/collective-employment-agreements/">https://uoacollectiveagreements.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/collective-employment-agreements/</a><a href="https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/dYMtCzvk8xtyQ7XAh4etZU?domain=uoacollectiveagreements.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/">https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/dYMtCzvk8xtyQ7XAh4etZU?domain=uoacollectiveagreements.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/</a>.</li>
