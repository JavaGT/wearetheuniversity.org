<p>Aotearoa boasts an exceptional array of young, up-and-coming classical musicians, and thanks to the annual <strong>Kiwi Music Scholarship</strong>, provided by the Kiwi Music Trust, five have been awarded $15,000 to help them navigate the competitive world of professional music.</p>

A gifted opera singer, last year he was accepted into the Artist Diploma programme at the San Francisco Music Conservatory. Described by his mentors as talented, dedicated, and professional, Siddharth is thrilled to have received the Kiwi Music Scholarship. “The Artist Diploma programme and this scholarship are not just steps in my journey—they propel me toward a future filled with promise and opportunity on the global stage of opera.”</p>
<p><strong>Cecile McNeill</strong> is a violist who has a Bachelor of Music from the University of Auckland and is currently working towards a Master of Music at the University of Southern California.
