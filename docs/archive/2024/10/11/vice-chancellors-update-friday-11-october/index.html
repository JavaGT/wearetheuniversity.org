<p>Kia ora tātou,</p>
<p>It has been a week of outstanding achievement across many areas of the
University.</p>
<p>Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2025</p>
<p>THE announced new rankings, and I am pleased to report that we have maintained a
strong position among the world&#39;s best universities. Our ranking has moved to
=152 from =150 the previous year, however we have improved our relative position
given the growth in the number of universities evaluated and against increasing
global competition. This is no small achievement and is an excellent result for
the University, reflecting our unwavering commitment to academic excellence and
research impact on a global scale. You can read more about the result on our
News pages

<p>National Tertiary Football Cup</p>
<p>Congratulations to the University&#39;s men&#39;s football team, who defended their
title as National Tertiary Football Cup champions at Eden Park on the weekend.
They are now advancing to the FISU Oceania Qualifier in Australia. Through the
University&#39;s official education and research partnership with Eden Park, we have
access to the No. 1 field for one day each year and were thrilled to be able to
host the weekend&#39;s competition on the hallowed ground.</p>
<p>Transition to new faculty arrangements</p>
<p>The transition to creating a new faculty and integrating the School of
Architecture and Planning and the Design Programme with the Faculty of
Engineering is progressing. Consultation on the proposed academic leadership and
professional staff structures has closed, with outcomes to be communicated in
late October. The Faculty Transition Leadership Team is also working on several
initiatives, including operational continuity plans, scholarships, hiring and
grant processes and new faculty names. Please refer to the website for
frequently asked questions in relation to the new faculty arrangements

<p>Update from Council meeting</p>
<p>This week, the University Council considered Senate&#39;s advice to pause the
Curriculum Framework Transformation (CFT) programme. Council acknowledged the
concerns raised by Senate members. Council noted that some policy and regulatory
approvals are already in place for the 2025 academic year, while others are
pending for elements including the transdisciplinary courses and expanded
learning components. Council has requested further advice from management,
Senate and faculty sub-committees on the direction and benefits of the CFT
programme for its March 2025 meeting. While preparatory work will need to
continue in the meantime, such advice is required before further policy and
regulatory decisions are made.</p>
