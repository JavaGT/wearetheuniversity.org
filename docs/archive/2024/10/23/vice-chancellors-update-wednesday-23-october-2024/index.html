<p>Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE) celebrates 21 years
Last week marked CIE’s 21st anniversary. This is a timely milestone as innovation and entrepreneurship, alongside commercialisation of research at the highest levels, are crucial to the future of higher education. Fittingly, these efforts were recognised with the University named top for the second consecutive year in a survey highlighting the most active start-up and spin-out companies in New Zealand and Australia.
