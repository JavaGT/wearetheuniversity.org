<p>University of Canterbury’s Tuihono UC | UC Online (UC Online) and the Institute of Data (IoD) have partnered to launch three new industry skills programmes in data science and AI, cyber security and software engineering.</p>
<p>The courses, starting on 15 October, are designed to equip students with the technical, interpersonal and critical thinking skills necessary to secure a job in the technology industry. Students immerse themselves in practical skills training for six months part-time and then receive ongoing career coaching until they secure a role in industry.</p>
<p>Peter Harpur, CEO of IoD, says the courses were designed to rapidly train mid-career professionals with the skills that industry need right now. He said feedback from employers is that IoD certified professionals have valuable skills and are able to make a difference immediately, whereas other graduates can take up to three months of on the job training.</p>
<p>“Even through challenging economic times, NZ Tech recently reported the number of tech jobs in New Zealand grew by 3,560 roles in 2023.</p>

<p>“New Zealand has a critical need for workers in data science, AI, cyber security and software engineering, but the challenge is finding workers with the right skills needed to immediately contribute. We’re thrilled to be working with the University of Canterbury’s UC Online team to train mid-career professionals that would not otherwise consider going back to university.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harpur recognises it’s increasingly difficult to secure employment in the current job market, but IoD graduates are adept in the latest technologies and are a step ahead of other job applicants.</p>
<p>“We recently published a review revealing 96% of Institute of Data graduates who participated in our job outcomes programme secured a job in the technology industry. The job outcomes programme includes unlimited, personalised coaching, employment presentations, job application and interview workshops, and personal brand development.”</p>
<p>UC also has an excellent track record of students securing employment. Dean of Future Learning and Development, Professor Michael Grimley says the university recognises there are many pathways in education and UC Online is key to this</p>
<p>“We’re excited for this partnership,” says Grimley, “as it demonstrates our commitment to work-ready, industry-led learning. These industry training programmes complement our existing flexible learning options as well as enhance our ability to support businesses in upskilling their staff.”</p>
<p>Applications are open now with more information available here.</p>
