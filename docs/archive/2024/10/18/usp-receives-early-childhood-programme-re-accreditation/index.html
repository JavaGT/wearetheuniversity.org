<p><strong>Friday, 18 October 2024, 12:46 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_Of_The_South_Pacific">University Of The South Pacific</a></strong></p>
<p>The University of the South Pacific’s (USP) Certificate III in Early Childhood Care and Education programme has received re-accreditation from the Australian Children’s Education and Care Quality Authority (ACECQA) for the next five years.</p>
<p>Offered through the Pacific Technical and Further Education (Pacific TAFE), the programme provides students with the skills and knowledge required to effectively work with infants and toddlers.</p>
<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor &amp; Vice-President (Education), Professor Jito Vanualailai said the accreditation highlighted the relevance and credibility of the course.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It also underscores our commitment to providing quality and exceptional education and training in early childhood care and I commend everyone involved in the accreditation process,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Our students will greatly benefit from this accreditation as they undertake an internationally recognised programme.”</p>
<p>PTAFE Director, Susan Sela added that the centre had invested in the programme being placed on the ACECQA list of accredited qualifications.</p>
<p>“Our team has done a lot of work in the area of early childhood education and care, and this is the outcome of that hard work,” she said.</p>
<p>“Students enrolled in the programme learn to plan their approach through observing children’s play and learning. They will also explore legislative and policy frameworks, and workplace health and safety.”</p>
<p>“Our certificate programme also emphasises issues affecting our Pacific communities so that graduates can think critically and become proactive members of the workforce.”</p>
