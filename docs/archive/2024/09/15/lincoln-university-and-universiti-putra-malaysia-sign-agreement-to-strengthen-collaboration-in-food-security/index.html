<p><strong>Sunday, 15 September 2024, 10:49 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>Lincoln University and Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) have signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), paving the way for enhanced research and academic collaboration between the two institutions.</p>
<p>Building on previous agreements and shared interests, the new MoU aims to deepen the partnership between the two universities, with a particular focus on the critical areas of agriculture and food security.</p>
<p>The agreement outlines key initiatives, including joint research activities, the exchanges of teaching and research staff, research training for Masters and Doctoral students, and active participation in joint symposiums, synthesis and other academic meetings.</p>
<p>Lincoln University Vice-Chancellor, Professor Grant Edwards, said he was delighted to sign the agreement, noting that it not only strengthens the existing relationship but also opens doors for broader collaboration with one of Malaysia’s leading agricultural universities.</p>
<p>“This agreement acknowledges our longstanding relationship with UPM and expands our cooperation into new areas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“By leveraging the synergies between UPM, a leader in agriculture and food security, and Lincoln University, a specialist in land-based disciplines, we can make significant strides towards achieving sustainable food security.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professor Edwards also highlighted that partnering with UPM also offers Lincoln University researchers the opportunity to enhance their work and contribute to the strategic Food Security Blueprint developed by UPM.</p>
