<p><strong>Monday, 16 September 2024, 2:03 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Today is a significant day for the many thousands of families whose lives are affected by cancer says National’s Health spokesperson Dr Shane Reti.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Today Pharmac confirmed that two vitally important medicines will be funded from October 1st - the first treatments to be delivered as a direct result of National’s campaign promise to improve access to cancer drugs,” Dr Reti says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“National’s campaigned on delivering 13 more cancer treatments when we reached Government. Since coming to Government, we’ve gone much further - through an unprecedented boost for Pharmac of $604 million over four years, up to 26 new life-extending cancer treatments are being made available for Kiwis who need them.</p>
<p>From 1 October, Keytruda will be funded for eligible people with five different types of cancer at different points in their treatment – including advanced triple-negative breast cancer, head and neck cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma.</p>
<p>“This is life changing for New Zealanders suffering from cancer,” Dr Reti says.</p>
<p>Pharmac also announced that Opdivo, which treats kidney cancer, will be funded from our investment from 1 November.</p>
<p>“It is expected that 600 eligible people will have access to Keytruda and Opdivo in the first year and that will rise to 2,300 over five years.</p>
<p>“Cancer causes heartbreak to thousands of Kiwis and their families every year. It is responsible for around 31 per cent of all deaths in New Zealand.</p>

<p>“One in three Kiwis will suffer from cancer in their lifetime. It affects thousands of people and their families every year.</p>
<p>“Improving access to cancer medicines is only one of the ways National is delivering better treatment for Kiwis with cancer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’ve set a target of 90 per cent of patients receiving cancer management within 31 days of the decision to treat. We have also committed to increasing breast screening eligibility to 74 year-olds, funded PET scanning accessibility for prostate cancer, expanded infusion services in Whanganui and Wairoa, invested in a new radiotherapy machine at Whangārei Hospital, and provided an extra $18 million a year to help people who need to travel for treatments like cancer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Actions like these reinforce that National’s promise to deliver on health, and specifically improving outcomes for people with cancer.</p>
<p>“Despite tough financial times, we will continue to deliver on that commitment,” says Dr Reti.</p>
