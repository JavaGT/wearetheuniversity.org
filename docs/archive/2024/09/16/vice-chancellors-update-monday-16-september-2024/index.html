<p>George Mason obituary
We were saddened to hear of the passing of major donor and alumnus George Mason ONZM last week.  George’s extraordinary 25-year giving contribution to the University included his generous provision of scholarships for masters and doctoral students and a landmark $5 million donation to establish the George Mason Centre for the Natural Environment. He was recognised with an honorary doctorate in 2016.
