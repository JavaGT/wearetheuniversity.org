<p><strong>Monday, 16 September 2024, 12:34 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZEI">NZEI</a></strong></p>
<p>Principals and teachers strongly agree that the Government’s fast-track mandating of two major curricula changes by the start of 2025 is requiring too much change too fast, an NZEI Te Riu Roa survey released today says.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, school leaders and teachers said the under-resourcing of a wide and complex range of learning needs of around 30% of their students was the key issue that needed the Government’s attention, and which made the pace of the curriculum changes unmanageable.</p>
<p>In a member survey conducted over the first two weeks of September, 77.5% of principals and 73.7% of teachers said change was happening too fast to be effective.</p>
<p><em>“It is unsustainable. As a principal in my fifth year in the role, I cannot see that I can sustain this level of work or stress for much longer unless something drastically changes. The worrying thing is, I feel like this already, before trying to hurriedly implement two new curriculum areas at the start of next year. It is simply not manageable.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It is important that we implement change with integrity. The current pace of change is a barrier to this happening. I am concerned that we will end up with rushed implementation that undermines both teaching and learning.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It is NOT doable.I am teaching full-time and being a principal early morning and late at night.I cannot cope with all these changes as well as everything else.”</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>67% of teachers and 63% of principals said the curriculum changes would not do anything to meet the real needs of kids in their school.</p>

<p><em>“If teaching was maths, writing and reading, and the other important learning areas, and students were all learning at approximately similar levels, no problem… It&#39;s when society expects us to parent, provide psychological support, toilet train, manage anxiety, be trauma informed, and maintain our own work-life balance — there are not enough hours in the day.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I have watched and waited for years to see greater specialist availability and special needs support that can be accessed in a timely manner. Sadly, it gets worse per year, not better. So many neuro-diverse pupils and so little diagnosis and / or resourcing, it is exhausting our amazing teachers, they will all leave if this keeps up.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Student outcomes are linked to lack of support, so the pace is one thing but neglecting the needs is the worst part — how are all children going to achieve without support?”</em></p>
<p>Schools reported a median of 30% of their students having additional learning needs. Just 1.1% of principals said these students were well-supported in their school, with 76.4% saying there was partial but inadequate support.</p>
<p>There was strong concern about the pace of change, even when educators supported the new curricula: 16.6% of teachers and 18.8% of principals thought the changes would impact positively, but only 6.2% of teachers and 5.3% of principals thought the pace of change was “about right”.</p>
<p><em>“The workload of a principal is absolutely enormous, as is the stress.I fully support the Government&#39;s initiative but to do the implementation well, we need time and better support for our children with additional need.”</em></p>
<p>Principals and teachers were also concerned about the increased work demands of implementing two new curricula simultaneously. 52.3% of principals and 37.5% or teachers said they were already working 51-60 hours a week, a third of teachers were working 41-50 hours a week, and 23.6% of principals were working 61-70 a week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>36.3% of teachers and 52.3% or principals said they thought the new curricula would require significantly more hours&#39; work a week on top of these hours, and 21.1% thought it would require two to five hours&#39; more work a week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both teachers and principals said a lack of learning support for students with learning needs and new government initiatives were among their top stressors at work.</p>
<p>This is backed up by OECD research that shows the share of teachers that report “quite a lot” or “a lot” of stress related to changing requirements from the national authorities is above the OECD average.*</p>
