<p><strong>Saturday, 28 September 2024, 3:43 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato">University of Waikato</a></strong></p>
<p>The University of Waikato welcomes the Government’s decision to take its proposed graduate entry medical school to the next stage, following the completion of an initial cost-benefit analysis.</p>
<p>“We are pleased that the analysis so far has provided the Government the confidence to see the project progress to a full business case,” University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley says.</p>
<p>“We look forward to continuing to work with the Ministry of Health to complete this process.”</p>
<p>The proposed new medical school would be New Zealand’s first graduate entry medical school. It would provide a new model of medical education for New Zealand with entry pathways that will attract a more diverse range of students.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Graduate entry is a common model of health education globally and has proven highly successful in targeting areas with specific need, such as primary care shortages,” Professor Quigley says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“We are confident in the ability of our proposed programme to address our chronic shortage of primary care doctors and provide more opportunities for New Zealanders to train as doctors.”</p>
<p>The University of Waikato continues to build its capability in health in response to community need and is home to New Zealand’s largest graduate entry nursing programme.</p>
<p>From next year, the University intends to offer the country’s first graduate entry programmes in pharmacy and midwifery.</p>
<p>Professor Quigley says the University of Waikato is well-placed to deliver a new medical school and it has widespread stakeholder support to do so.</p>
<p>“We look forward to continuing to work with the Government on the processes required to facilitate the medical school.”</p>
