<p>Senate meeting 
Following an additional meeting of Senate, held on Tuesday 27 August, a motion was passed recommending a pause to the implementation of the Curriculum Framework Transformation (CFT) to allow Senate to fully discuss the implications of the proposed course optimisation processes. The next Senate meeting will be held on 16 September, providing another opportunity to discuss and respond to the matters raised at the extra Senate meeting prior to the reports and advice from both meetings being considered by Council in October. Meantime the Faculty Deans determined, at a Provost, Deans and Directors Committee (PDDC) meeting, that they will work through any further course review processes using the usual faculty academic procedures. These procedures enable local consideration of the coherence of programmes and offerings as well as academic workloads.</p>
<p>Cook Islands PM Visit
The University welcomed the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands, The Hon Mark Brown, to the City Campus yesterday. This visit provided an opportunity to strengthen the University’s relationships with the Pacific Island region, and discuss Pacific-led research and future educational opportunities.</p>
<p>University Advisory Group phase two consultation
The second consultation phase of the University Advisory Group (UAG) concluded last week, with the University providing a comprehensive response. This phase focused on the core activities of teaching, research and knowledge transfer, as well as university governance and management. The UAG’s final report is expected to be submitted to the government in February, and we keenly anticipate the findings.</p>
