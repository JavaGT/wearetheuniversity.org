<p>AUT Professor Dr Valery Feigin is the corresponding author in a new study published today in <em>The Lancet Neurology</em> on global stroke risk. The article finds that incidences of strokes have increased from 1990 to 2021 globally.</p>
<p>Professor Feigin, who leads the NISAN (National Institute for Stroke and Applied Neurosciences) team which won Te Puiaki Pūtaiao Matua a Te Pirimia The Prime Minister&#39;s Science Prize in 2022 is available to talk with media about the study and how Aotearoa should respond to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The NZ priorities should be in implementing effective primary stroke prevention strategies for all individuals at increased risk of stroke, regardless of the level of the increased risk,&quot; Professor Feigin says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;The emphasis should be on population-wide prevention strategies and controlling elevated blood pressure and lifestyle risk factors, especially weight, alcohol abuse, smoking, poor diet - like sugary drinks and junk food - and low physical activity.&quot;</p>
<p>Data in the study shows how Aotearoa compares to other countries around the world. For some context:</p>
<p>Age-standardised stroke incidence was lowest in Luxemburg (58 per 100,000 population) and highest in the Solomon Islands (355 per 100,000). <strong>Age-standardised stroke incidence rate in NZ was 68 per 100,000 people in 2021</strong></p>
<p>The rate of people who die from stroke (age-standardised per 100,000 population) was lowest in Singapore (14 per 100,000) and highest in North Macedonia (277 per 100,000). <strong>Age-standardised stroke death rate in NZ was 29 per 100,000 people in 2021.</strong></p>
<p>Age-standardised DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) rates were lowest in Switzerland (333 per 100,000 population) and highest in Nauru (6,100 per100,000). <strong>Age-standardised stroke DALY rate in NZ was 527 per 100,000 people in 2021</strong></p>
