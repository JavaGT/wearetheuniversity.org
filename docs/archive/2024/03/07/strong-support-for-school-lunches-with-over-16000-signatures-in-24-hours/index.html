<p><strong>Thursday, 7 March 2024, 11:06 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Government must commit to funding free and healthy school lunches, as thousands of people sign the petition to keep them, education spokesperson Jan Tinetti says.</p>
<p>“Teachers, parents and school communities are incredibly passionate about the free and healthy school lunches programme,” Jan Tinetti said.</p>
<p>“In 24 hours, 16,405 people signed the petition Labour launched at 10:30am yesterday.</p>
<p>“This is a programme that feeds our kids, helps them to learn, and saves families money. It is exactly the kind of programme that should continue to be funded, especially during a cost of living crisis.</p>
<p>“Teachers are seeing more attention in the classroom and parents and caregivers are saving $33 per week per child, or up to $1,250 per year per child on average.</p>
<p>“Christopher Luxon and David Seymour must commit to keeping the programme and give schools, parents and providers certainty.</p>
<p>“The free and healthy school lunches programme feeds more than 200,000 children in nearly 1000 schools. It also employs hundreds of people in our communities – and they need certainty too.</p>
<p>“If the Government is serious about ensuring children have enough to eat they will not scrap this programme,” Jan Tinetti said.</p>
