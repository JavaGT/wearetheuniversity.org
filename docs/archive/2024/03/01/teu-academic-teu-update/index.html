<p>Reminder: Pay Equity claim meetings. Claims for low-paid university library, clerical, and administrative staff are underway, and your views are needed. The claims can only be assessed accurately if the real nature of your work is well understood. Job descriptions and process documents are not substitutes. Only you and your colleagues can describe in detail the actual work you do.</p>
<p>The TEU is running a series of meetings for members and non-members under the claim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>discuss what happens next with the pay equity claims;</li>
<li>get key information about the real nature of your work;</li>
<li>talk about the way your roles will be assessed;</li>
<li>give advice on how to talk about your work in a way that communicates your responsibilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following meetings will be held in March. Attend the meeting that works best for you. We have spread the meetings across campuses to make it more convenient, but feel free to attend whichever meeting you wish.</p>

<p>A message from the Rainbow Rep, Andy Fey. As Auckland Pride Month draws to a close, I had the joy of attending the all-Faculties Rainbow Orientation run by Campus Life on Wednesday night.
In a packed and colourful lecture theatre, students from across the University connected with one another and their Faculty Rainbow Clubs. I’m particularly proud of some of our TEU U35 members on the club executive. For those of you whose summer employment is coming to a close, know that the TEU will always welcome you back.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling like you need your own ‘orientation support’, consider browsing the recently released LGBTQIA, Takatāpui &amp; MVPFAFF+ friendly teaching and learning resource on Canvas: <a href="https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/113745">https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/113745</a>
Developed by TEU members in concert with an advisory group of staff and students, this resource has plenty of material to help you navigate supporting and respecting your Rainbow students (and colleagues!) in the university context.</p>
<p>Yoga classes for TEU members. Join us for TEU Yoga on Thursday mornings weeks 2-6 (inclusive) of semester 1 from 0800 to 0855 am at the Mclaurin Chapel on the main university campus. These classes will be led by Reha Kumar, winner of the Yoga Teacher of the Year Award from Sport New Zealand in 2023 and active yoga advocate and educator. Reha teaches accessible yoga for all body types.  Each class is capped at 20 students and free for TEU members. Non-member guests are welcome but will need to bring a $10 contribution. You can register here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yvJWm665HZv7xRhs7sdoVFZotquo4LWxCPgZj_q2fz0/edit">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yvJWm665HZv7xRhs7sdoVFZotquo4LWxCPgZj_q2fz0/edit</a>
In the second half of the semester the class will be offered at the Grafton campus, so if you are based there, please keep an eye out!</p>
<p>Last week we noted RadioNZ’s use of the Official Information Act to learn that tertiary institutions are relying on hostels and consultancy work to make ends meet, because teaching students is barely “profitable” for universities and is loss-making for polytechnics. NZ universities facing a &#39;liquidity crisis&#39; - briefing | RNZ News<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/509620/nz-universities-facing-a-liquidity-crisis-briefing">https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/509620/nz-universities-facing-a-liquidity-crisis-briefing</a>.  This week, we see reports that students are finding the cost of campus living is onerous in the extreme.

<p>All-staff forum. The first of these was held on Wednesday. It provided senior management’s overview of the year ahead.  The VC is wary about the direction of the new government, concerned about external research funding opportunities, and worried about liberal democracy’s future. There are also: a Taumata Teitei “refresh”, ongoing proposals for curriculum transformation, initiatives to increase public engagement (Eden Park naming rights is but one), and “substrategies” for marketing, recruitment, communications, and engagement. Enrolments are reported to have increased, including at the postgraduate level, and for Māori, although there remain serious concerns about the capabilities of incoming cohorts (but there was no mention of the passing or graduation rates of students). As usual, management believes that enrolment processes have improved (“a thousand fewer concessions”), although staff feedback, at the forum and elsewhere, suggests otherwise.</p>
<p>“A third of respondents said they didn’t see a positive future for themselves in Aotearoa.” The passing of Fa’anānā Efeso Collins and the celebration of his inspiring work on behalf of Pasifika youth is also a reminder of how much work we all need to do in this area.  TEU member Analosa Veukiso-Ulugia’s (Curriculum and Pedagogy) research looks at the issues Pasifika youth continue to face in our society. <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2024/02/26/Housing-insecurity-and-mental-health-major-concerns-for-Pacific-youth.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2024/02/26/Housing-insecurity-and-mental-health-major-concerns-for-Pacific-youth.html</a><a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2024/02/26/Housing-insecurity-and-mental-health-major-concerns-for-Pacific-youth.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2024/02/26/Housing-insecurity-and-mental-health-major-concerns-for-Pacific-youth.html</a></p>
