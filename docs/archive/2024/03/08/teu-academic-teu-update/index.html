<p>International Women’s Day breakfast event.  We thank our branch committee members Rachel Simon-Kumar, Christiane Rupp, Jennifer Frost and Callie Vandewiele for being the prime movers for this standing room only, energising event this morning.  Attendees heard from ProVC (Equity) Cathy Stinear who explained the process by which the University has committed to analysis of gender pay gaps. Today, International Women’s Day, is the day on which a snapshot of the relevant data is officially taken, university-wide. The results will be analysed for this year’s report in September. The audience also heard powerful messages from TEU members. Sereana Naepi reminded us of the power of personal stories that make the statistics more human, and drive change. Nicola Gaston insisted that despite official disclaimers that getting the pay gap to zero is “not the target”, it must be the target.  Suzanne Acharya shared some sickening reports of the verbal violence and micro-aggressions to which women staff of colour are subjected, not by random members of the public but by their managers and colleagues, and not in the past but now. We will be building on this event to craft a bargaining claim related to gender pay equity this year with meeting to follow (see below also).

<p>Professional Staff Reminder: Pay Equity claim meetings. Claims for low-paid university library, clerical, and administrative staff are underway, and your views are needed. The claims can only be assessed accurately if the real nature of your work is well understood. Job descriptions and process documents are not substitutes. Only you and your colleagues can describe in detail the actual work you do.</p>
<p>The TEU is running a series of meetings for members and non-members under the claim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>discuss what happens next with the pay equity claims;</li>
<li>get key information about the real nature of your work;</li>
<li>talk about the way your roles will be assessed;</li>
<li>give advice on how to talk about your work in a way that communicates your responsibilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following meetings will be held in March. Attend the meeting that works best for you. We have spread the meetings across campuses to make it more convenient, but feel free to attend whichever meeting you wish.</p>
