<p>The group, led by STARlab Director Dr. Marissa Kaloga and administered through the U.S. Embassy in New Zealand, will meet with institutions and communities at the forefront of social entrepreneurship and social innovation.

<p>“Social work and entrepreneurship have more in common than you might realize: pragmatic, applied, and interdisciplinary, these two fields have a lot to learn from one another. It’s an honour for STARlab to host this delegation, and I’m looking forward to seeing what ideas emerge from this work,” says Dr. Marissa Kaloga, Lecturer at University of Otago, and Director of STARlab.</p>
<p>&quot;The collaboration with Dr. Kaloga and her team at STARlab represents an extraordinary opportunity to bridge disciplines and cultures, propelling us toward meaningful systemic change,&quot; states Dr. Jamie Newth, Senior Lecturer at the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>&quot;It is always a pleasure to create a space of <em>ako</em> - learning and sharing - between social enterprises and international guests to not only showcase the talent and impact that our social enterprise community is having here in Aotearoa New Zealand but also hear fresh insights from leading professionals in this field&quot; said Nicola Nation, CEO Ākina Foundation.</p>
