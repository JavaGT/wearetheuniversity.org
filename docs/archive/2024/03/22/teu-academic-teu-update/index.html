<p>Bargaining. I send this from a meeting of TEU representatives across the sector at National office. With branch committee member, Antonia Verstappen (FMHS) and our organisers, Nicole and Andy, we have been discussing strategy and claims that bridge the tertiary sector, as well as advising other branches as to our site-specific issues. We came away with many ideas on both fronts with well- developed timelines.  Members will be receiving more information in the next month or so. Noel has been organising meetings to discuss our plans and claims for this year and we have brought many of these with us to Wellington.  If you are interested in getting involved in the campaign this year, please email <a href="mailto:noel.zeng@auckland.ac.nz">noel.zeng@auckland.ac.nz</a></p>
<p>All-staff forum next Wednesday. The session is to include feedback from the recent Senior Leadership Team Strategic Planning Day and an update on the Annual Report and finance, all themes that promise to be relevant to bargaining and much else.</p>
<p>Reminder: Pay Equity claim meetings. Claims for low-paid university library, clerical, and administrative staff are underway, and our organiser Nicole reports that the meetings have been well attended with great conversations about the many ways in which your job, on paper, does not resemble your reality. Remember that claims can only be assessed accurately if the real nature of your work is well understood.</p>
<p>The TEU is continuing to run a series of meetings for members and non-members under the claim to:
discuss what happens next with the pay equity claims; develop key information about the real nature of your work; describe the way your roles will be assessed; and offer advice on how to talk about your work in a way that communicates your responsibilities.</p>
<p>The final meetings will be held next week. Please attend the meeting that works best for you. We have spread the meetings across campuses to make it more convenient, but feel free to attend whichever meeting you wish.</p>
