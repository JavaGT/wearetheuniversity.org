<p>Kia ora koutou,</p>
<p>Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland has a multicultural student
population of close to 45,000. As Club’s Expo attests, this large group of
students has diverse interests and needs.</p>
<p>As you know, the University responds to these social, health and wellbeing,
exercise, study, and religious interests and needs with dedicated facilities,
spaces and support.  </p>
<p>We have designated rooms across the University for multiple teaching, research,
study and extra-curricular purposes. Some of these spaces are for Maori and
Pacific students.</p>
<p>We are proud of the inclusive and welcoming community we have created for and
with students and the support provided for your success. The University
community is open and welcomes your friends and whanau.</p>
<p>Programmes to support Maori and Pacific students began from the 1970s and are
now in place across the University. These programmes have received government
support from 2001 and are recognised as contributing significantly to Maori and
Pacific success.</p>
<p>Recent publicity about space made available for Maori and Pacific students
singles out a group of students amongst thousands—many of whom use spaces
designated for them and their interests and needs.</p>
<p>Waipapa Taumata Rau respects all students and calls on you all to respect your
peers. You will be aware of our Code of Conduct
