<p>Pay Equity claim meetings. Claims for low-paid university library, clerical, and administrative staff are underway, and your views are needed. The claims can only be assessed accurately if the real nature of your work is well understood. Job descriptions and process documents are not substitutes. Only you and your colleagues can describe in detail the actual work you do.</p>
<p>The TEU is running a series of meetings for members and non-members under the claim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>discuss what happens next with the pay equity claims;</li>
<li>get key information about the real nature of your work;</li>
<li>talk about the way your roles will be assessed;</li>
<li>give advice on how to talk about your work in a way that communicates your responsibilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following meetings will be held in March. Attend the meeting that works best for you. We have spread the meetings across campuses to make it more convenient, but feel free to attend whichever meeting you wish.</p>

<p>Bargaining resumes this year. We encourage members to consider stepping up to participate in this important process. We rely on members’ collective cohesion to defend and improve our working conditions. If you are intrigued and/or game, please contact one of the organisers <a href="mailto:nicole.wallace@teu.ac.nz">nicole.wallace@teu.ac.nz</a> or <a href="mailto:andy.hipkiss@teu.ac.nz">andy.hipkiss@teu.ac.nz</a> who can offer more details. We are particularly interested in the participation of professional staff and those in any of the many precarious roles.</p>
<p>Branch committee meeting. We held our first formal meeting of the year on Wednesday. Among items of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tamsin Kingston, our Health, Safety and Wellbeing lead, reported on the following items from the latest HSW committee meeting: (1) the discomfort in some workplaces at the height of summer (and depths of winter).  Speaking up and reporting the issue remain important elements. (2) the ineffectiveness –or variable performance, same thing-- of the UoA Alert phone app was acknowledged, with assurances it was being worked on. (3) Senior HSW management also claim that this will be the year in which some traction is made on the wellbeing element of the name. This, you will be aware, has been a conspicuous absence for as long as any of us have been here. (4) The results of the WorkSafe survey (to which staff contributed) are first being presented to leadership teams of divisions and faculties with the expectation that this will be shared further. We are watching and waiting.</li>
<li>Maribel Caballero (Finance) reports that our finances are in solid state and that we can proceed with plans for investing some money in important local kaupapa, including member recruitment and wellbeing.  We will publicise these more in coming weeks.</li>
<li>In May, we will be sending a six-person contingent to attend the TEU’s annual conference, the first under our co-governance structure.  We have not finalised our delegation’s composition but we will aim to be diverse, balanced and strongly engaged.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fa&#39;anānā Efeso Collins.

Fa&#39;anānā was a strong advocate for his community in South Auckland and for social justice, and had only begun his first term as a Green MP. He was a youth-, student-, and community leader; he was a city councillor and mayoral candidate. Fa&#39;anānā had multiple ties to Waipapa Taumata Rau: he was an alumnus, graduating with an MA with a thesis on ‘brown flight’. Vision and legacy of Efeso Collins will endure - The University of Auckland<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2024/02/21/vision-and-legacy-of-lau-afioga-fa-ann-efeso-collins-will-endure.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2024/02/21/vision-and-legacy-of-lau-afioga-fa-ann-efeso-collins-will-endure.html</a>. We especially remember Fa&#39;anānā as one of the few politicians who answered our call and supported the bargaining-related rallies and strike during the last bargaining round. Fa&#39;anānā was a brave and forthright orator. Our thoughts are with his wife, children and aiga during this heartbreaking time.</p>
