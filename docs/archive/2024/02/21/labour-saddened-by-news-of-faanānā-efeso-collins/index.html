<p><strong>Wednesday, 21 February 2024, 10:48 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Labour Party is devastated by news of Green MP and long-time Labour member Fa’anānā Efeso Collins, who died during a charity event this morning.</p>
<p>“I first met Efeso when he was President of the Auckland Student Association in 1999. We connected because of shared values, a love for New Zealand as a country that supports and embraces all people,” Labour Leader Chris Hipkins said.</p>
<p>“Efeso was a member of the Labour Party for a long time and stood for the Party several times. I have deep respect for him and his politics and am saddened by the news today.”</p>
<p>Labour’s Pacific Caucus members are also in mourning.</p>
<p>“Many of us worked or studied with Efeso over several decades. Efeso was a passionate advocate for our community and a role model for the people of South Auckland and New Zealand’s Pacific community,” deputy Labour Leader Carmel Sepuloni said.</p>
<p>“We are thinking of Efeso’s wife and his two beautiful daughters, his wider whānau, friends and community. The loss of this courageous man will be felt by so many.</p>
<p>“This has deeply affected us as a Labour Party, our Pacific caucus members and MPs across Parliament.”</p>
