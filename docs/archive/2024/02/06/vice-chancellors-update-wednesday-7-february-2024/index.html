<p>Welcome back and a belated Happy New Year.</p>
<p>I hope you all managed a relaxing and reinvigorating summer holiday, Anniversary long weekend and Waitangi Day with whānau and friends.</p>
<p>The academic year is already well underway, with Summer School, Summer Start and Quarter One all well attended. We also look forward to the start of Semester One at the end of this month, with students starting to move into campus accommodations next week. Thank you to everyone who has helped to ensure a smooth start to the year for our students.</p>
<p>Several major projects are also underway on our campuses in 2024. The move of Education and Social Work from Epsom is proceeding well, and on Friday we officially welcome the Faculty to its new home. By Matariki in June the Epsom Marae, Te Aka Matua ki Te Pou Hawaiki, will also be re-established at its new site on the City Campus.</p>
<p>At this time, we are also conscious of the political tensions and conflict that are currently challenging many parts of the world. I am confident this University will continue to excel in 2024 as a place where ideas and different points of view can be expressed and debated safely and with mutual respect.</p>
