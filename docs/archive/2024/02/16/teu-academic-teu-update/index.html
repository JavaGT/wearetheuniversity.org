<p>Pay Equity claim meetings. Claims for low-paid university library, clerical, and administrative staff are underway, and your views are needed. The claims can only be assessed accurately if the real nature of your work is well understood. Job descriptions and process documents are not substitutes. Only you and your colleagues can describe in detail the actual work you do.</p>
<p>The TEU is running a series of meetings for members and non-members under the claim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>discuss what happens next with the pay equity claims;</li>
<li>get key information about the real nature of your work;</li>
<li>talk about the way your roles will be assessed;</li>
<li>give advice on how to talk about your work in a way that communicates your responsibilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following meetings will be held in March. Attend the meeting that works best for you. We have spread the meetings across campuses to make it more convenient, but feel free to attend whichever meeting you wish.</p>

<p>Professional Staff Annual Salary Review Appeals. Appeals of last year’s salary review (i.e., the increase determined through Tupu) are open now until 5pm Friday 23 Feb. Details on raising an appeal are here<a href="https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/news-events-and-notices/notices/notices-2024/quarter-1/annual-salary-review-appeal-process.html">https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/news-events-and-notices/notices/notices-2024/quarter-1/annual-salary-review-appeal-process.html</a>.  We encourage you to consider applying if there has been a (significant) failure of process or if your Tupu grade is at odds with the evidence. You can also talk to one of our organisers if you have concerns over how Tupu has been applied in your case.</p>
