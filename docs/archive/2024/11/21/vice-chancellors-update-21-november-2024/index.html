<p>This week we celebrated the blessing of the new Hiwa, Recreation Centre ahead of its opening next week. The centre’s new name ‘Hiwa’, named after the youngest star in the Matariki cluster and meaning vigorous, active, robust and sound, was revealed.

<p>Future Executive and Senior Leadership Team
With the creation of the Faculty of Arts and Education (see below) and the recent announcement that the Provost will be leaving the University at the end of this year, I will be taking the opportunity over the coming weeks to review membership of the University Executive Committee (UEC) with the aim of having a revised UEC and Senior Leadership Team (SLT) approach for the forthcoming year.</p>
<p>Dean of Law
Staff in the Law School have been invited to submit an expression of interest to be the Acting Dean of Law until 30 June 2025. It is the intention that the process will be completed prior to Christmas and the new Acting Dean will start at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>New Faculty names confirmed
Following staff and student consultation, the name for the new faculty incorporating the current Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Education and Social Work, Elam School of Fine Arts, School of Music, and Dance Programme, has been agreed as the Faculty of Arts and Education, with the Te Reo name of Te Pūtahi Mātauranga, meaning ‘the confluence of knowledges/disciplines, and of knowing’.</p>
<p>The name for the expanded Engineering Faculty, encompassing the School of Architecture and Planning and the Design Programme, will be the Faculty of Engineering and Design. The Faculty’s Te Reo name is currently in development.</p>
