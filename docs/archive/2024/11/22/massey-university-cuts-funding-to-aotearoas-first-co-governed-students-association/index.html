<p><strong>Friday, 22 November 2024, 7:58 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University_Students_Association">Massey University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Massey University’s decision to cut funding for Te Tira Ahu Pae, Aotearoa’s first co-governed students’ association, has provoked outrage among students, who see it as another example of the university disregarding their voices. Many are calling the move a betrayal of students’ wishes and an attack on independent representation.</p>
<p>Creative Arts student Marie says she is disappointed, stating that the decision <em>“contrasts sharply with the recent large-scale hīkoi to Parliament advocating for co-governance.”</em> Political Studies student Peter Helm accuses the university’s leadership of <em>“aligning with alt-right ideologies and fostering racial division,”</em> which he believes is entirely disconnected from the sentiments of the student body.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Massey has defended its decision, claiming governance issues within Te Tira Ahu Pae. Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Dr Tere McGonagle-Daly, says, <em>“We continue to have ongoing concerns that the representation model/structure is no longer adequately serving the student body.”</em> However, students argue this is a pretext to dismantle their independent voice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Green Party MP Francisco Hernandez supports Massey students in their fight for independent representation. <em>“It’s really important that students have an independent and self-governing voice that stands at arm’s length from the university and provides genuinely independent advocacy services,”</em> he says. Hernandez has been actively involved in discussions between the university and the student association and expresses hope for a resolution. <em>“While I’m concerned Massey University has taken this drastic step, I’m confident we can work through the issues with dialogue and good-faith negotiations.”</em></p>

<p>Students are mobilizing against the funding cut, which they argue undermines independent student representation and sets a dangerous precedent for student unionism across New Zealand. Many believe the university’s leadership, particularly McGonagle-Daly, has acted in bad faith, prioritizing control over genuine student advocacy.</p>
<p>The controversy comes at a time of heightened national discourse on co-governance and Māori rights. On November 19, 2024, over 55,000 people participated in a historic hīkoi to Parliament, protesting the proposed Treaty Principles Bill, which many see as an attack on Māori rights and co-governance structures. The timing of Massey’s decision, juxtaposed with this widespread show of support for co-governance, has only deepened students’ mistrust of the university’s intentions.</p>
<p>As students prepare to resist the decision, they are calling on Massey to reverse the funding cut and uphold its commitment to inclusivity and genuine representation. <em>“This is about more than just one student association,”</em> says Marie. <em>“It’s about protecting the voices of students and the values of co-governance that are integral to Aotearoa.”</em></p>
