ahead of its opening next week. The centre’s new name ‘Hiwa’, named after the
youngest star in the Matariki cluster and meaning vigorous, active, robust and
sound, was revealed. Find out more about Hiwa and memberships on the New

<p>New Faculty names confirmed</p>
<p>Following staff and student consultation, the name for the new faculty
incorporating the current Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Education and Social Work,
Elam School of Fine Arts, School of Music, and Dance Programme, has been agreed
as the Faculty of Arts and Education, with the Te Reo name of Te Putahi
Matauranga, meaning ‘the confluence of knowledges/disciplines, and of knowing’.</p>
<p>The name for the expanded Engineering Faculty, encompassing the School of
Architecture and Planning and the Design Programme, will be the Faculty of
Engineering and Design. The Faculty’s Te Reo name is currently in development.</p>
