<p><strong>Tuesday, 19 November 2024, 12:39 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>With public submissions <a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=YyX-DSxGoP8lauBiiRsfNMXOWfhmZNCf4ARSIKa1UAWr5TB61BTFg64ImzHX4_ksVxQYI97KSpvXyk4tV0la27BGB_ORmonzYiYVQtU8OHI&e=752ed10e9ed7db3a7867d6b86ebadc6c&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=submissions_open_all_kiwis_enc&n=2">now open on the Treaty Principles Bill</a>, ACT Leader David Seymour is encouraging all New Zealanders to have their say.</p>
<p>“Since 1975 when the Waitangi Tribunal decided the Treaty has ‘principles’, the job of interpreting those principles has been left to unelected judges. That changes today,” says Mr Seymour.</p>
<p>“For the first time, Kiwis of all backgrounds are now able to tell Parliament what they think the Treaty means for future generations of New Zealanders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Are we a ‘partnership’ between two different groups with different rights? Or are we a modern multi-ethnic democracy united by common humanity, where each person has the same rights and duties?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“This fundamental question needs to be answered if we are to move forward and solve our problems together.</p>
<p>“Thousands of New Zealanders are marching in Wellington today to make their feelings known. I hope they will now read the Bill and engage in the substance of the debate via the select committee process.</p>
<p>“Many more New Zealanders in the rest of the country are going about their day as normal, working to provide a better future for themselves and their loves ones. I hope they will also make their voice heard by making a submission when they have the time.”</p>
<p>Submissions to the Justice select committee close on 7 January.</p>
