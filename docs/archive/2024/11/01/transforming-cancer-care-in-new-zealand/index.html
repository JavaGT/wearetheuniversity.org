<p>National’s Health spokesperson Dr Shane Reti says November 1 represents more transformative change for cancer patients under a Christopher Luxon-led Government, as 13 additional drugs funded from a $604 million boost start to become available.</p>
<p>“From today, thousands more Kiwis are set to benefit from this country’s biggest ever funding investment for cancer, which National drove from the outset,” Dr Reti says</p>
<p>“The 13 new medicines funded from today, when added to the first round of treatments funded from 1 October, mean we can provide help for an estimated 10,000 people in the first year.</p>
<p>“It’s fantastic to see what a difference our actions to prioritise treatment for cancer and other serious conditions can make in people’s lives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The medicines funded from today cover blood and bone marrow cancers, bowel cancer, kidney cancer, other cancers, schizophrenia and skin infections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“I’m incredibly proud to be part of this ongoing progress, and our other cancer initiatives from our first 12 months.</p>
<p>“We’ve taken action to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce a target for faster cancer treatment</li>
<li>Increase access to PET-CT scanning, which is particularly helpful for diagnosis of prostate cancer</li>
<li>Extend free breast screening to include women aged 70-74</li>
<li>Build a new cancer radiotherapy machine at Whangārei Hospital, so 520 Northlanders a year will no longer have to travel to Auckland for treatment</li>
<li>Boost the National Travel Assistance scheme by $18 million per year for those that need to travel for treatment.</li>
</ul>
