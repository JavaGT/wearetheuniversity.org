<p>As we move closer to the end of 2024, I would like to acknowledge the many positive and significant contributions that our University community continues to make. I am looking forward to working with you all into 2025 with optimism.</p>
<p>Recreation Centre
After several years of planning, our new Recreation Centre opens this month. Championed by the late Sir Colin Maiden, a past vice-chancellor, the vision was a vibrant hub where our community could play sports, maintain fitness, have fun and socialise. This vision has now come to life, providing our University with a world-class facility that enhances community well-being and enriches students’ education and overall University experience. I am sure many of you enjoyed the virtual walk-through of the facilities at last week’s all-staff forum. Further information, including membership details and instructions for accessing a two-week trial and summer membership, is available on the Recreation Centre Intranet page.<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/intranet/stay-informed/staff-communications/notices/new-rec-centre-opens.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/intranet/stay-informed/staff-communications/notices/new-rec-centre-opens.html</a></p>
<p>Dean of Law
I want to thank acting Dean of Law, Professor Warren Swain, whose term expires at the end of the year. Professor Swain wishes to return to teaching and his research within the Faculty at the conclusion of his term. Professor Swain’s willingness to act in the role has provided ongoing momentum and progress to the Faculty and caps his very significant contributions to the Law Faculty over many years in leadership roles and as part of the University&#39;s senior leadership.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM)

<p>Times Higher Education (THE) Global Academic Reputation survey
THE is launching its annual survey and will soon invite academic staff to participate. I encourage all those eligible to do so. As the results inform THE’s rankings, this is a unique opportunity to shape perceptions of academic excellence and support our University’s standing in one of the most influential global rankings.</p>
