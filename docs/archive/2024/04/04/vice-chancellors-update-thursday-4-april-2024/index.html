<p>Senior staff recruitment
I would like to provide an update on the recruitment process for the three Dean positions currently being considered.</p>
<p>Dean of Science
Applications to the current round of recruitment have now closed and the panel will review these over the next few weeks. We will then move through our usual process of shortlisting, interviews, focus group discussions and due diligence. We are grateful to Professor John Hosking who has agreed to remain as Dean until early September.</p>
<p>Dean of Law
Discussions with the Professoriate have commenced, and a full international search will launch next week. We appreciate that Professor Warren Swain has agreed to continue as Acting Dean until the end of the year.</p>
<p>Dean of Arts
As recently communicated, Professor Robert Greenberg announced his resignation to take up a new position at the University of Newcastle, New South Wales. We thank the current Deputy Dean, Professor Greg Booth, who has agreed to be Acting Dean from mid-May until the end of the year.</p>
<p>Study space signage
Following the political and media interest last week regarding designated spaces for Māori and Pacific students, I would like to reinforce our commitment to supporting the diverse interests and needs of our students. We are proud of the community we have created for and with students and the support we provide for their success. Providing designated spaces for multiple teaching, research, study and extra-curricular purposes, some of which are for Māori and Pacific students, is one way in which we do this. These, along with other government-backed programmes, have been in place for decades.</p>
<p>Recent discussions once again highlight the importance of respecting all people within our community, which is outlined in our Code of Conduct <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/on-campus/life-on-campus/code-of-conduct.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/on-campus/life-on-campus/code-of-conduct.html</a> and Te Ara Tautika | The Equity Policy<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/policy-hub/university-governance/equity/equity-policy.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/policy-hub/university-governance/equity/equity-policy.html</a>.  We recognise the challenges that this heightened focus has brought and want to remind you that an Employee Assistance Programme<a href="https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/human-resources/support/employee-assistance-programme.html">https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/human-resources/support/employee-assistance-programme.html</a> is available to all staff should you need it. </p>
<p>All-staff forum March recording
The March all-staff forum took place last week, covering the Senior Leadership Team’s recent strategic planning day, an update on our 2023 annual report, the proposed new faculty arrangements and the reviews and budget announcements from the government. If you were unable to attend, the recording is available to view.<a href="https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/news-events-and-notices/vc-staff-forums/2024/02.html">https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/news-events-and-notices/vc-staff-forums/2024/02.html</a></p>
