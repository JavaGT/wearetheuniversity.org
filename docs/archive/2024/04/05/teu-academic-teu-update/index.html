<p>Faculty re-structure. We sent message last week to members on the proposed dismantling of Arts, CAI and E&amp;SW and creation of a new Faculty that will house all three (with Architecture and Planning perhaps moving to Engineering). To discuss the proposal, all members are invited to a meeting next Thursday the 12 April, from 11.30-12.30 in the new building 201.393. We encourage you to attend and share your thoughts and questions. These will inform the branch’s feedback to the proposal. Branch Presidents and organisers will be available in the room between 11 and 1pm if you can’t make the meeting but would still like to chat. We encourage you to invite non-members; we will also be inviting senior leadership to attend.</p>
<p>The Branch Committee’s main concern is that the proposal, as presented, does not contain enough information for our members (or staff generally) to make any informed judgment and provide feedback on whether the proposal is sound or not. We have been clear to the employer that more information and documentation need to be provided if consultation is to be legitimate. This is particularly important given that the employer has signalled that a merger could lead to a restructure in the future (though please do note that no jobs will be restructured as a direct result of the proposal).</p>
<p>At our insistence, some additional information has been released today (attached) and added to the Staff FAQs<a href="https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/news-events-and-notices/notices/notices-2024/quarter-1/proposed-new-faculty-arrangements.html">https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/news-events-and-notices/notices/notices-2024/quarter-1/proposed-new-faculty-arrangements.html</a>.  Members will make their own determination if this is sufficient.
A reminder that Noel created a Google poll [Initial feedback on employer proposal to merge faculties - Google Forms<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1o-_RTCFck_XIWfT0bNU3QTRRo5aeGas474faNJklyBk/edit">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1o-_RTCFck_XIWfT0bNU3QTRRo5aeGas474faNJklyBk/edit</a>] to record members’ views, questions, etc on the proposal. We encourage members to do so. Members who, despite the lack of information, know what they think may also send email directly to <a href="mailto:strategicinitiative@auckland.ac.nz">strategicinitiative@auckland.ac.nz</a></p>

<p>Fast-track approvals. As you may be aware, the government is proposing new legislation called the Fast Track Approvals Bill. Its purpose is to give government ministers the power to override the Resource Management Act, the Conservation Act, the Wildlife Act, the Crown Minerals Act, the Fisheries Act, et al to unilaterally approve projects without consultation or any other due process including input from academic experts.  At the instigation of Tiakina te Taiao, the TEU’s Climate Action Network, the TEU has developed an open letter opposing the Bill. Please sign it, make a submission on the Bill, and circulate the open letter to your branch asking members to sign. Submissions on the Bill close in two weeks. <a href="https://www.together.org.nz/fast_track_approvals_bill_open_letter">https://www.together.org.nz/fast_track_approvals_bill_open_letter</a></p>
<p>Seminar on links across education sector in Aotearoa:  Wednesday 10 April 1230-1330 in 201-377 (The virtual learning space).  The VC’s announcement of the proposal to merge faculties coincides with considerable discussion about what is working and what is not working in New Zealand’s schools. Crisis is an overworked term, but it is not enough to claim that this crisis has been manufactured. Academic study of Education is central to understanding what is happening to schools, teachers and students, but the field is contested, fragmented, and populated by a range of actors and policymakers.  This seminar will provide an up-to-date guide to the educational landscape in Aotearoa. It will examine different ‘traditions’ of educational knowledge and how these are being reshaped by wider societal and cultural forces. The seminar will identify the key fault lines in the study of Education and highlight the choices we face in advancing the educational project. There will a provocation and room for discussion. The seminar will be hosted by John Morgan (Head of the School of Critical Studies in Education) <a href="mailto:john.morgan@auckland.ac.nz">john.morgan@auckland.ac.nz</a></p>
