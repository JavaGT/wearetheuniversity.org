<p>Faculty re-structure. The sales pitch for the re-structure is ongoing. Earlier this week Faculty of Arts staff were invited to a &quot;Special Arts Faculty Hui: Strategic Initiative&quot;. A member went and took notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“One of our colleagues asked whether the panel could provide any reassurances that the restructure would not lead to Associate Dean positions that are unmanageable, and the panel said that nothing has been determined yet because they are still in the process of scoping out whether a restructure makes sense.</li>
<li>Another colleague asked what assurances could be given that this restructure would not be used as an opportunity to cut professional staff who support academics, and the panel responded that they could not give such assurance.</li>
<li>A third raised the point that employees are human beings, and that the constant change has been exhausting for employees. She asked what kind of resources the administration is prepared to offer to prevent employee demoralization from yet another change. The panel wasn&#39;t able to offer anything.</li>
<li>Given how much the panel was selling the idea that this change would offer many benefits, including making us &quot;stronger and more resilient&quot;, one colleague sensibly asked what metrics the administration would be using to assess the success of the restructure. Adrienne Cleland answered that question and all she could offer were vagaries, such as the vibrancy and success of the units.</li>
<li>One of our colleagues asked what the leadership would do to allow a multiplicity of voices to be represented during the transition process, and this question was conveniently ignored.</li>
<li>Another pointed out the very short timeline (January 1st) in which they sought to make the changes, and how disruptive such a speedy timeline could be. The panel was undeterred as they were of the opinion it could be done.</li>
<li>One colleague asked the panel to comment on the discrepancy between Dawn Freshwater saying, in the zoom call, that restructure had to happen, and the fact the panel was backpedalling by saying that we are at the stage of the process where we’re deciding whether to restructure, and emphasizing that the restructure is only in the &quot;if&quot; stage... The Provost responded by stating they have to say “If” because if they didn’t, they wouldn’t be able to say they had consulted us… which led everyone to laugh out loud at the Provost’s gaffe. The Dean tried to rescue the situation by saying it&#39;s not a done deal as it would still have to be approved by Council, though this ignores the fact Council tends to act as a rubber stamp for the administration.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Members remain frustrated at the reluctant, partial, selective drip-feed of information, such as Proposed new faculty arrangements staff FAQs – more added 12 April - The University of Auckland<a href="https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/news-events-and-notices/notices/notices-2024/quarter-1/proposed-new-faculty-arrangements.html">https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/news-events-and-notices/notices/notices-2024/quarter-1/proposed-new-faculty-arrangements.html</a> to which, I am advised, eight new ones have been posted recently.  <a href="https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/news-events-and-notices/notices/notices-2024/quarter-1/proposed-new-faculty-arrangements.html">https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/news-events-and-notices/notices/notices-2024/quarter-1/proposed-new-faculty-arrangements.html</a></p>
<p>The Branch Committee is preparing a submission, based on feedback received in person and on the Google form  [Initial feedback on employer proposal to merge faculties - Google Forms<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1o-_RTCFck_XIWfT0bNU3QTRRo5aeGas474faNJklyBk/edit">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1o-_RTCFck_XIWfT0bNU3QTRRo5aeGas474faNJklyBk/edit</a>]. Please fill this out if you have not yet done so. The branch committee strongly encourages members to make submissions, particularly group submissions with your colleagues. If you feel you cannot make an informed view of the proposal given the lack of information, make this clear in your submission. It is very important that senior management gets this message, even if this is the only feedback you give.

<p>New Branch committee member. We recently welcomed Hester Archarya to the Branch committee. By way of introduction, Hester writes: &quot;Kia ora! My name is Hester and I started working at Waipapa Taumata Rau in September of last year. I work at the City Campus Student Hubs as a Hub Advisor. I also completed my BA/BFA conjoint degree in 2021 and BA(Hons) in History in 2022 here. I am most passionate about working in front-facing services, where I can directly support students and create more equitable experiences for them. I am always looking at where I can do more work behind the scenes, which is why I wanted to join the TEU Branch Committee. I aim to find more ways in creating more equitable environments, services, and overall experiences for both staff and students, as well as ways to ensure that the voices, stories, and concerns of minority/marginalized groups are being heard.</p>
<p>As a member of the Women of Colour Staff Network (WOC) and the Student Hubs team, I am learning more every day about the experiences, issues, gaps, and concerns that students, POC, WOC, and front-facing services face regularly. I hope I can represent the WOC Network in bringing these experiences to the front, where they can be used in finding ways to fill existing gaps and create safer and equitable workplaces.&quot;</p>
<p>Nau mai haere mai, Hester. We look forward to working with you.</p>
