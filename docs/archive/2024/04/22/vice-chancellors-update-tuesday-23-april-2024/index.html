<p>While we pause to remember and pay tribute on Anzac Day later this week, much of our focus looks to the future.</p>
<p>Government reviews of universities and the science system</p>
<p>We are already engaging with the Sir Peter Gluckman-led reviews announced by Ministers Judith Collins and Penny Simmonds last month. These are comprehensive reviews with government-appointed panels, which will provide final reports in February 2025. Both panels are looking to engage directly with university staff. More information about this will be provided soon.</p>
<p>Proposed new faculty arrangements</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has provided feedback on this proposal so far. If you still need to do so or wish to provide further input, please note that the online feedback form<a href="https://auckland.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6olpVs826xcPZsi">https://auckland.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6olpVs826xcPZsi</a> closes at 5pm today. Following this, submissions will be reviewed by a Review Committee comprising both staff and students. Council will consider their recommendations and advice from Senate in June.</p>
<p>Universitas 21 2024</p>
<p>The University will be represented at the Universitas 21 (U21) Annual Network Meeting and Symposium this week. The theme for the meeting is ‘Global Universities and the Workforce of the Future’. We are one of four universities selected to present case studies on this subject with our Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship to be showcased.</p>
<p>All-staff forum, Wednesday 24 April</p>
<p>This month&#39;s all-staff forum is tomorrow at noon. Our focus will be on student-related topics, including admissions, transition programmes and the implementation of the Curriculum Framework Transformation.</p>
<p>Flu vaccines</p>
<p>A reminder that with winter approaching, flu vaccines and Covid-19 boosters are free to permanent and fixed-term staff. Details on where these are available can be found on the 2024 influenza and vaccination for staff and students<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/notices/2024/flu-vaccination.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/notices/2024/flu-vaccination.html</a> notice page.</p>
