<p>“While Kiwi households and government departments are tightening their budgets, the Human Rights Commission is throwing its $15 million budget at left-wing activism – the latest being <a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=PFyDgz5u5mNM1aPaZeBb0i72CBxjmC10crxCSe8BQGU7OwwmRm5Go3bKKE_BQxOG--rxt3a2JHyPFnYvNP917Q&e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=hrc_hijacked_by_radicals_disba&n=2">a campaign for a divisive constitution</a>,” says ACT Justice spokesperson Todd Stephenson.</p>
<p>“After it recently hired Claire Charters, a co-author of the radically divisive He Puapua report, the Commission has now held a conference at Auckland University called ‘Designing our Constitution’ for the purpose of designing a ‘Te Tiriti-based constitution’.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=qPvJye65LD_tuJsh0zZMfhXpNwuEGHmCaRl0CEsBv3fbOliOdrJoUt9x0TCGtG_49TTZb_gk61r_QmQPjkn7w-D6_KRP2LtdhQ0Qc2LsuV4&e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=hrc_hijacked_by_radicals_disba&n=3">On its Facebook page</a>, the Commission quotes one conference speaker as suggesting ‘constitutional transformation based on honouring te Tiriti o Waitangi’ is ‘inevitable’.</p>
<p>“The Commission has gone far beyond its legislated functions, and is exploiting taxpayer money and the credibility of its official status to promote a divisive interpretation of the Treaty.</p>
<p>“If these left-wing radicals want to agitate for constitutional reform, they should get elected by the people and seek a mandate for that. If they won’t or can’t act democratically, they should stick to helping people who’ve had their basic human rights breached.</p>
<p>“Once a benign entity focus on human rights, the Commission is now a group of left-wing activists masquerading as politically-neutral bureaucrats. The Commission continues to exploit precious taxpayer resources to promote co-governance, and has previously campaigned in support of left-wing causes like benefit hikes, a ‘living wage’, ‘Fair Pay’ Agreements, and hate speech laws.</p>
<p>“The tidiest course of action is to abolish the Commission entirely, commit to political neutrality in the public sector, and leave ideological debates to elected representatives. Its $15 million annual budget could be redirected toward core services, debt reduction, or tax relief for working Kiwis.”</p>
