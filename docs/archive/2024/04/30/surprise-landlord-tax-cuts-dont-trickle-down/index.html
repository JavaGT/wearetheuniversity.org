<p><strong>Tuesday, 30 April 2024, 11:45 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Green Party is renewing its call for rent controls following reports of rental prices hitting an all-time high.</p>
<p>“Landlords are the only people who are being well-served by our Government. People who rent are already struggling with sky high rents – and can see very clearly the lie that tax cuts for landlords will trickle down to help,” says Green Party Housing spokesperson Tamatha Paul.</p>
<p>Properties on Trade Me’s rental index have risen by an average of $50 in the last year, bringing the national median rental price to $650.</p>
<p>“The government has given landlords a $2.9 billion tax break at a time when rents are skyrocketing and families are struggling to put food on the table. Landlords are laughing their way to the bank.</p>
<p>“An increasing number of people in New Zealand have no choice but to rent. If we want renting to be attractive, dignified and affordable, we need controls on rent increases, a rental warrant of fitness, and to urgently build new housing.</p>
<p>“The Government must stop tipping the playing field so heavily in landlords’ favour. Rental housing is in a dire and deteriorating state and requires urgent action.</p>
<p>“For decades, successive governments have normalised sub-standard housing in Aotearoa that is so bad it hospitalises people with preventable illnesses. Thousands of children are admitted to hospital each year from living in damp, mouldy homes.</p>
<p>“Housing is a human right. We can and must ensure it is afforded to all,” says Tamatha Paul.</p>
