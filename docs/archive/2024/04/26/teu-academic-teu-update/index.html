<p>Faculty re-structure. The deadline has passed for submissions on the biggest, fastest, least detailed proposal to restructure that we can recall.  The Branch Committee, on behalf of members, made a submission (attached). It is a synthesis of feedback received from members and members of the Branch committee. We thank Jennifer Frost, Noel Zeng, and Andy Hipkiss who solicited members’ views, presented the results in quantifiable form, collated individual statements and sentiments, and organised arguments. As presented to staff, this a poorly articulated, incomplete, rushed, and (because of what it does not include) possibly deceptive change proposal.  Staff have a right to be fully and meaningfully consulted because we have large professional and personal stakes in the outcome.</p>
<p>Academic Workload Guidelines have finally been released. This was work with unofficial, de facto TEU input and we thank our members for being engaged in this process. Academic staff: please make sure you read these (along with the Academic Workload Principles and Policy here<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/policy-hub/people-culture/academic-processes-standards/academic-workload-principles-policy.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/policy-hub/people-culture/academic-processes-standards/academic-workload-principles-policy.html</a>). If your workload is not consistent with either the Guidelines or the Policy, raise this with your Academic Head. And contact the organisers, Nicole or Andy, if the issue is not resolved.

<p>Submissions to Science System Advisory Group. SSAG is open for submissions: Submit - Science System Advisory Group <a href="https://ssag.org.nz/submit/">ssag.org.nz</a>.  It intends to work in several phases, with submissions sought during successive phases. “Phase 1 submissions will consider high-level sectoral questions that consider the role of science and innovation in New Zealand to inform the interim report. They are now seeking public submissions for Phase 1 for the Science System Advisory Group. Submissions for Phase 1 will close at 11.59pm, Friday 17 May 2024.” (“Phase 2 will focus on operational details (e.g. funding tools and mechanisms, workforce, infrastructure etc.), broader aspects of the science and innovation system and the many elements of the science and innovation system not specifically addressed here.”).</p>
<p>A reminder of the background to the above.

<p>Students urge a rent strike over accommodation cost increases. Students for Fair Rent <a href="https://sfr.org.nz/">sfr.org.nz</a> continue to build a community of students tired of being charged escalating rents for university accommodation. The current issue of Craccum <a href="http://craccum.co.nz/current-issue/">http://craccum.co.nz/current-issue/</a> has a piece by Oliver Cocker who has direct experience with such accommodation and is analytical of the situation.</p>
<p>Fast-track legislation. Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union has made a submission on this legislation: FINAL_TEU_Submission_on_Fast-track_Approvals_Bill.pdf <a href="https://teu-production.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/FINAL_TEU_Submission_on_Fast-track_Approvals_Bill.pdf">teu-production.s3.amazonaws.com</a>. Far from abhorring co-governance, this government embraces it, but only if its partner represents corporate interests.  Dame Professor Anne Salmond points out other problems: “Even before the deadline for submissions to the select committee has expired, the ministers have appointed an advisory group, and invited projects to be submitted to the fast-track process. They are behaving as if the select committee process has already been decided, and public concerns about this draft legislation have been dismissed in advance.”  Anne Salmond: An open submission on this radical, flawed fast-track bill <a href="https://newsroom.co.nz/2024/04/20/anne-salmond-my-open-submission-on-this-radical-flawed-fast-track-bill/">newsroom.co.nz</a>.   Hmm...where else have we seen that behaviour?</p>

<p>UNION, the movie. The New Zealand premiere will be 1800 on 30 April, at the Capitol Cinema. The Amazon Labor Union (ALU), a group of current and former Amazon workers in New York’s Staten Island, takes on one of the world’s largest and most powerful companies in the fight to unionise. Chronicling the historic efforts of the ALU, UNION is an intimate and surprising story of dogged determination, unorthodox tactics, and speaking up despite David vs. Goliath odds. Capturing in-the-trenches moments with the upstart labour union leaders, including the charismatic Chris Smalls, as they try to build support for their movement on their own terms, filmmakers Brett Story and Stephen Maing bear witness to the realities of labour organising in the United States. They track exhilarating victories and demoralising setbacks along the way, but foremost spotlight the far-reaching ability of collective action to inspire hope and bring self-determination to workers who’ve long felt disenfranchised and powerless. All proceeds will go to support UnionAID’s project with Samoa First Union, funding a Workers Advice Centre in Apia, Samoa<a href="https://u14759160.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.MP4r7IZvcboZnKkn1OpA5wF0z0xg-2FPmw148nZsu5bY-2Fxj821psCwYTSuWwZSorrSoxq1-2FIVu49bc-2BGy3t6T1URRs5WzF5KMw-2F75HpnYAHsxZCRDi-2FIiGcdQD-2Bdx9Xi-2FjPaUg_-2BedPFmhUHS9y9UsUycKhSk4SANWBp3wLomVAJfuPqSL2vArrfIlXMcywWWGQ-2FWSC9Giv3dZYFEXrsHImVxes-2BCgTpX3rCEgpSZbo8GJLEl-2Ftke7ZKG29i-2FeKjQQ5396z-2BPkQs1-2FHS7sCeezK3Tg2iHOHpjc5if2dswJUJxPWpYlHJBbanHlL5XoLbtkDJAWTAxBsTvI8snHcs-2BY771f9TgCvtt1jBfo7QcPvA5DVpCv95McseL6IzbzydBtt9brdW461JpmH5Mj41soxwlnd7-2FHx6jdPLK1czQUf9gH1BkFW7xzb4eYYR2LUU44UO95qMBaUeGW6HHhvX51IkeQLuEJtWAeaRHQfcZSGz71U1BlCbenFfO6yYMLYUxaeqyFAAFs7YmZqft45hP4BrPyBzVeaZM86UWKnt4zah2LmKmxFEmVJsKWsJ8gWWBs9jBFKN88EkdVXSm6r7GenYHmbz0R1ksAYvrB5FQlKPZMiooo-3D">https://u14759160.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.MP4r7IZvcboZnKkn1OpA5wF0z0xg-2FPmw148nZsu5bY-2Fxj821psCwYTSuWwZSorrSoxq1-2FIVu49bc-2BGy3t6T1URRs5WzF5KMw-2F75HpnYAHsxZCRDi-2FIiGcdQD-2Bdx9Xi-2FjPaUg_-2BedPFmhUHS9y9UsUycKhSk4SANWBp3wLomVAJfuPqSL2vArrfIlXMcywWWGQ-2FWSC9Giv3dZYFEXrsHImVxes-2BCgTpX3rCEgpSZbo8GJLEl-2Ftke7ZKG29i-2FeKjQQ5396z-2BPkQs1-2FHS7sCeezK3Tg2iHOHpjc5if2dswJUJxPWpYlHJBbanHlL5XoLbtkDJAWTAxBsTvI8snHcs-2BY771f9TgCvtt1jBfo7QcPvA5DVpCv95McseL6IzbzydBtt9brdW461JpmH5Mj41soxwlnd7-2FHx6jdPLK1czQUf9gH1BkFW7xzb4eYYR2LUU44UO95qMBaUeGW6HHhvX51IkeQLuEJtWAeaRHQfcZSGz71U1BlCbenFfO6yYMLYUxaeqyFAAFs7YmZqft45hP4BrPyBzVeaZM86UWKnt4zah2LmKmxFEmVJsKWsJ8gWWBs9jBFKN88EkdVXSm6r7GenYHmbz0R1ksAYvrB5FQlKPZMiooo-3D</a>.

<p>Celebrating and remembering workers. In the average workday in Aotearoa, 32 workers suffer an injury that requires more than a week off work. Accidents at work regularly occur on our campuses also. Every year on 28 April, Workers’ Memorial Day commemorates those working people killed and injured at work. And 1 May, International Workers&#39; Day, next Wednesday, celebrates organised labour’s role in, among other things, dignifying workers with greater pay and an 8h workday. It serves as a day to advocate for workers&#39; rights, fair labour practices, and social justice. From 12pm outside Britomart on 1 May, a number of NZ unions will be rallying to resist the current government’s overriding of workers’ rights, Te Titiri, and democracy. See <a href="https://teu.ac.nz/news/may-day/">https://teu.ac.nz/news/may-day/</a><a href="https://teu.ac.nz/news/may-day/">https://teu.ac.nz/news/may-day/</a> for more information. We hope that you will be able to participate.</p>
