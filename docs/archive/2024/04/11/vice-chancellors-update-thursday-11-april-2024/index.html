<p>Māori and Pacific university entrance parity
This morning we pledged our commitment to improving Māori and Pacific University Entrance (UE) pass rates by signing a Memorandum of Understanding with 12 Auckland schools. Through this partnership we have agreed to take action to increase success at a tertiary level to achieve UE parity for Māori and Pacific learners by 2030. Further information about the new approach to increasing Māori and Pacific success is available on our news page<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2024/04/10/new-approach-to-increase-maori-and-pacific.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2024/04/10/new-approach-to-increase-maori-and-pacific.html</a>.</p>
