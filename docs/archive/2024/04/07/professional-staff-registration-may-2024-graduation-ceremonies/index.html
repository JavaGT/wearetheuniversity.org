<p>Our ‘Autumn’ Graduation ceremonies will take place on Monday 6, Tuesday 7 and Wednesday 8 May at Spark Arena and Tuesday 14 May at the Auckland Town Hall and we are seeking your help with the ceremonies.</p>
<p>Below are details of how you can volunteer at these Graduation Ceremonies.</p>
<p>The success of graduation is dependent upon support from staff who assist during each graduation day. We would appreciate your registration as a volunteer to assist with marshalling the graduands.</p>
<p>To indicate your availability to marshal click here<a href="https://www.student.admin.auckland.ac.nz/psp/ps/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/UOA_DEVELOPMENT.UOA_GRAD_WEB_FORM.GBL?PORTALPARAM_PTCNAV=UOA_GRAD_WEB_FORM_GBL&EOPP.SCNode=HRMS&EOPP.SCPortal=EMPLOYEE&EOPP.SCName=HCSR_RECORDS_AND_REGISTRATION&EOPP.SCLabel=Records%20and%20Enrolment&EOPP.SCPTfname=HCSR_RECORDS_AND_REGISTRATION&FolderPath=PORTAL_ROOT_OBJECT.HCSR_RECORDS_AND_REGISTRATION.HCSR_GRADUATION.UOA_GRAD_WEB_FORM_GBL&IsFolder=false">https://www.student.admin.auckland.ac.nz/psp/ps/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/UOA_DEVELOPMENT.UOA_GRAD_WEB_FORM.GBL?PORTALPARAM_PTCNAV=UOA_GRAD_WEB_FORM_GBL&amp;EOPP.SCNode=HRMS&amp;EOPP.SCPortal=EMPLOYEE&amp;EOPP.SCName=HCSR_RECORDS_AND_REGISTRATION&amp;EOPP.SCLabel=Records%20and%20Enrolment&amp;EOPP.SCPTfname=HCSR_RECORDS_AND_REGISTRATION&amp;FolderPath=PORTAL_ROOT_OBJECT.HCSR_RECORDS_AND_REGISTRATION.HCSR_GRADUATION.UOA_GRAD_WEB_FORM_GBL&amp;IsFolder=false</a> and log in. Select the ‘Graduation Marshalling’ button to access the form, your regalia requirements can be entered on the form before submitting.</p>
<p>Please complete the form by midday on Monday 21st April.</p>
<p>While we endeavour to assign roles to as many staff as possible, not all staff may be assigned a role. If you do not receive a role it is because more staff than we have roles for have requested to marshal during a ceremony.</p>
<p>Once roles have been assigned, a detailed list of duties will be forwarded to all participants who have been assigned a role. Briefings will be held for staff who have been assigned roles. There will be separate briefings for Spark Arena and the Town Hall. Details for the briefings are as follows, please note the dates and times in case you are selected for a role.</p>
<p>Spark Arena Ceremonies</p>
<p>Briefing # 1- Wednesday 1 May (Section Coordinators and Section Checkers) – 1.30 pm via Zoom</p>
<p>Briefing # 2 - Wednesday 1 May (for roles inside the auditorium) – 2.30 pm via Zoom</p>
<p>Briefing # 3- Thursday 2 May (Section Coordinators and Section Checkers) – 10.am via Zoom</p>
<p>Briefing # 4- Thursday 2 May (for roles inside the auditorium) – 11 am via Zoom</p>
<p>Town Hall Ceremonies</p>
<p>Briefing # 1- Thursday 9 May (all roles) – 2 pm via Zoom</p>
<p>Briefing # 2- Friday 10 May (all roles) – 10 am via Zoom</p>
<p>If you cannot attend one of the briefing sessions for your role you must contact the Graduation Office regarding training. There is no opportunity on the day of graduation to direct people in their tasks, so we can’t roster staff to help if they do not attend a briefing.</p>
<p>The schedule of ceremonies and information regarding marshalling is available on the staff intranet<a href="https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/staff-intranet/teaching-and-students/services-for-students/graduation-2">https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/staff-intranet/teaching-and-students/services-for-students/graduation-2</a>.</p>
