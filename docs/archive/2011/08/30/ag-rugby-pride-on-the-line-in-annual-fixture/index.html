<p><strong>Ag rugby pride on the line in annual fixture</strong></p>
<p>The Massey Ag XV will be out to win back the LA Brooks Trophy when the team travels south for the annual rugby match between Massey and Lincoln universities on Saturday.</p>
<p>The trophy was first contested in 1952 then reinstated seven years ago after a 39-year hiatus.</p>
<p>The winning team also receives the MOG Shield, a wooden trophy bearing a resemblance to a toilet seat.</p>
<p>For the first time, a netball game between Massey and Lincoln is also being played and a group from the Massey University Young Farmers Club is making the trip to cheer on the visiting team. Their Lincoln hosts have arranged for the group to be billeted with Lincoln students.</p>
<p>Alumni relations manager Jasmine Groves says the event provides the opportunity for current and former students to get together. “This year there will be a lot more Massey support on the sidelines,” she says. “There is also an after-match function that will give current and former players the chance to reflect on the friendly rivalry.”</p>
<p>The match kicks off at 2.45pm on Saturday September 3 at the Lincoln University Rugby Fields, Gate Two, Lincoln University.</p>
