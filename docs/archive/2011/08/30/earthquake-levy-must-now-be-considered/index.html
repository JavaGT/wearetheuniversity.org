<p><strong>Earthquake levy must now be considered</strong></p>
<p>The Government must consider a temporary earthquake levy to help address the skyrocketing costs of the Canterbury earthquakes, Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman said today.</p>
<p>The Government this morning upgraded the cost of the Canterbury earthquakes by $4 billion. Damage to homes was more severe than had been earlier estimated. The Green Party had previously suggested a temporary earthquake levy on all income earners over $48,000 similar to one imposed in Australia after their costly floods.</p>
<p>“A small temporary earthquake levy is the fairest way to pay for the rebuilding of Christchurch,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“The Key Government has previously rejected the idea of a levy stating we had the funds to cover our liabilities.</p>
<p>“Now it turns out the Government was wrong by four billion dollars. It is poor economic management to have not managed the Government’s finances in a way that can absorb these kinds of shocks.</p>
<p>“It’s now time to investigate a temporary levy on income.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders have indicated they are prepared to fund a levy as the fairest way to share the costs of the earthquake. Ignoring this option in favour of more debt is bad economic management.</p>
<p>“Residents of Christchurch have already been hit with rates rises and will be exempt from this levy,” said Dr Norman.</p>
