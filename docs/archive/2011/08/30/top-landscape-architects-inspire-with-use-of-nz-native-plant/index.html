<p><strong>Top landscape architects inspire with use of NZ native plants</strong></p>
<p>Twenty of New Zealand’s top landscape architects and designers offer their wisdom and expertise on how to get the best out of New Zealand’s native plants in the newly released book, <em>Native by Design</em>.</p>
<p>Published by Canterbury University Press (CUP), <em>Native by Design: Landscape design with New Zealand plants,</em> is the latest offering from editors Professor Ian Spellerberg from Lincoln University and Napier-based environmental and planning consultant Michele Frey, who also put together the popular <em>Living with Natives: New Zealanders talk about their love of native plants</em> (CUP, 2008).</p>
<p><em>Native by Design</em> features a series of personal narratives from leading landscape architects and designers, showcasing some of New Zealand’s most beautiful outdoor environments.</p>
<p>In the book’s foreword, Governor General Sir Anand Satyanand said <em>Native by Design</em> “beautifully extols the virtues of New Zealand’s native flora” with designs that “show New Zealand vegetation at its best and in a variety of settings, from commercial and industrial frontages to public and private parks and urban and rural gardens”.</p>
<p>The uniqueness and beauty of each location has been captured in this lavishly illustrated book through the stunning photography of Christchurch-based photographer John Maillard, whose work also illustrated <em>Living with Natives</em>.</p>
<p>Among the designers and architects who share their vision and passion for working with native New Zealand plants, as well as their expert advice, are award-winning garden designer Xanthe White, and landscape architects Dennis Scott and Alan Titchener.</p>

<p>Professor Spellerberg and Ms Frey said the aim of the book was to raise the profile of New Zealand’s native plants, as well as encourage people to make a place for native flora in their gardens.</p>
<p>They believe the book will offer inspiration to not only home gardeners but professional landscape architects and gardeners as well.</p>
<p>It is the third in a series of books on New Zealand’s native plants published by CUP that began with <em>Going Native</em> (CUP, 2004, 2009), written by Professor Spellerberg and the late botanist David Given.</p>
<p><em>Native by Design</em> was published with the support of Resene Paints Limited, The Isaac Conservation and Wildlife Trust, Interface Carpets (NZ), Kiwi Flora Plant Nursery and Opus International Consultants Ltd.</p>
<p>It will be launched on 1 September, 5.30-7pm, at the Resene ColorShop Tower Junction, 8-9 Whiteleigh Avenue, Tower Junction, Christchurch.</p>
<p>All royalties from the sale of the book will go to native plant projects around the country.</p>
