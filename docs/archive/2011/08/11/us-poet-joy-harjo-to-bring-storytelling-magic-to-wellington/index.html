<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>11 August 2011</p>
<p><strong>US poet Joy Harjo to bring storytelling magic to Wellington</strong></p>
<p>Renowned US poet Joy Harjo is being brought to Wellington by Victoria University’s International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML) this month.</p>
<p>She will lead a masterclass for the IIML’s MA students and give two public presentations.</p>
<p>“Joy Harjo is a brilliant performer whose poetry blends a storytelling tradition with song, and draws from the American tradition of praising the land and the spirit,” says Professor Bill Manhire, Director of the IIML.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be hosting her very first visit to New Zealand—especially as Joy was a student at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop along with the IIML’s founder, Glenn Schaeffer.”</p>
<p>Of Muskogee Creek heritage, Ms Harjo was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Her seven books of poetry, including <em>How We Became Human-New and Selected Poems, The Woman Who Fell From the Sky,</em> and <strong><em>She Had Some Horses</em></strong> have garnered numerous awards. These include the New Mexico Governor’s Award for Excellence in the Arts; the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Native Writers’ Circle of the Americas; and the William Carlos Williams Award from the Poetry Society of America. <em>For A Girl Becoming</em>, a young adult/coming of age book, was released in 2009 and is Ms Harjo’s most recent publication.</p>
<p>She has released four award-winning CDs of original music and in 2009 won a Native American Music Award (NAMMY) for Best Female Artist of the Year for <em>Winding Through the Milky Way.</em></p>

<p>She received a Rasmusson: US Artists Fellowship in 2008 and is a founding board member of the Native Arts and Cultures Foundation.</p>
