<h3>PM should experience VSM first hand, say Auckland students</h3>
<p>Students at the University of Auckland this morning have called for Prime Minister John Key to visit the premises of the Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA), and see for himself the effects of voluntary students’ association membership (VSM).</p>
<p>Membership of AUSA is currently voluntary, but students are urging the Prime Minister not to support ACT’s destructive VSM bill.</p>
<p>AUSA President Joe McCrory was standing outside the University’s Fale Pasifika building as the Prime Minister hosted the Pacific Leader&#39;s Forum Lecture Series.</p>
<p>“National should listen to students, and forge a lasting compromise on student association membership” McCrory said.</p>
<p>“AUSA has been voluntary since 1999, and the lack of services compared to other, smaller, universities shows that students are being shortchanged by this ideological crusade by the ACT Party. National can retain student choice as well as strong community institutions like AUSA by supporting opt-out membership, where the small minority of students who oppose advocacy and representation can choose not to join without the majority losing their culture and their voice,” McCrory said.</p>
<p>“We’re asking National to be rational and drop ACT’s bill. John Key can ensure that student life remains vibrant and inclusive,” McCrory said.</p>
<p>AUSA will be sending another formal invitation to John Key to visit the campus again this week.</p>
<p>“We hope that the Prime Minister will see for himself the consequences of ACT’s VSM nightmare,” McCrory concluded.</p>
