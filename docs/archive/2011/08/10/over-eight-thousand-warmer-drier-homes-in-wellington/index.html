<p><strong>Over eight thousand warmer, drier homes in Wellington</strong></p>
<p>10 August 2011</p>
<p>Paul Foster-Bell, National Candidate for Wellington Central, welcomes news that 8,217 homes in Wellington have been retrofitted with good quality insulation and clean heating in the year ended June.</p>
<p>“In June this year alone, more than 2,250 homes were retrofitted here in Wellington,” he says.</p>
<p>“At this time of year, especially in our beautiful but often windy Capital, it’s particularly important that our homes are warm, dry, and healthy.</p>
<p>“During these cold months, many of us suffer from colds, flu and asthma that proper insulation and heating can help prevent. Thanks to new under-floor insulation, ceiling insulation, and clean heating such as heat pumps, more than 15,000 Wellington families now have warmer, healthier homes.</p>
<p>“So far more than 114,000 homes around New Zealand are warmer, drier, and healthier thanks to the Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart scheme. That’s more than 300,000 people enjoying better living conditions.</p>
<p>“Many providers registered under the scheme have hired new staff to cope with the demand, while insulation manufacturers have increased production.</p>
<p>“This is a win-win situation for Wellington. If you haven’t yet had your home retrofitted, you can call EECA on 0800 749 782 to find out if you’re eligible.”</p>
<p>Anyone who has a home built before 2000 is eligible for 33 per cent off the cost of installing ceiling and under-floor insulation up to a maximum of $1300. Community Service Card holders can get 60 per cent off the cost of installing insulation.</p>
<p>The National-led Government is spending $347 million over four years to retrofit at least 188,000 homes. Since July 2009, more than 114,000 homes around New Zealand have been retrofitted through the scheme.</p>
