<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday 2 August 2011</strong></p>
<p>**<br>AUT Business School recognised among the best in the world**</p>
<p>The AUT University Business School has been recognised among the top five percent of business schools in the world.</p>
<p>AACSB International, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business – an internationally renowned organisation – has acknowledged the AUT Business School’s excellence in teaching and research with the distinction of AACSB Accreditation.</p>
<p>Vice Chancellor, Derek McCormack is delighted with the global recognition offered by this leading management education body.</p>
<p>“AACSB-accredited schools are considered the best business schools in the world, with the highest standards of education.</p>
<p>“It is gratifying to be recognised for our commitment to rigorous and relevant business education, by the longest serving global accrediting body for university business schools.”</p>
<p>AUT Business School Dean, Dr Geoff Perry says AACSB Accreditation is a stamp of quality for both students and employers.</p>
<p>“We pride ourselves on developing students as confident, capable business professionals, ready to step straight into the work force. Our graduates are highly valued by employers in New Zealand and overseas. Through our focus on student-centred learning and our strong connections with industry, our curriculum reflects the changing needs of contemporary business. Our research echoes this applied emphasis and is of value to both the business community and academia.”</p>
<p>Dr Perry says of particular interest to AACSB International were the opportunities offered by the School’s business internships, a unique programme of work placement that provides students with hands-on experience in the business world.</p>
<p>“Our internships enhance graduate employment opportunities and create further links between the Business School and industry. Furthermore, students can undertake these internships overseas or participate in our international exchange programme.<br>These options for international exposure and experience significantly strengthen our students’ professional and personal capabilities. The AUT Business School has student exchange partnerships with some of the best business schools in the world and AACSB accreditation will help to expand these valuable relationships.”</p>
<p>To achieve accreditation, a business school must undergo a meticulous review and evaluation process, stretching over several years. Once accreditation is achieved, ongoing maintenance processes and continuous improvement strategies must be implemented, with a formal re-accreditation review occurring every five years.</p>
