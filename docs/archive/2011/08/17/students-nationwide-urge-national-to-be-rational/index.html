<p>Students nationwide urge National to be Rational</p>
<p>Students around the country are today urging National to be ‘rational’ and stop supporting ACT’s Bill to end universal membership of student’s associations. Rallies were scheduled to coincide with an originally scheduled Member’s Day in Parliament when the Bill was due to be debated further.</p>
<p>“Students&#39; associations are vital community institutions, and are important in ensuring a fair deal for students, quality teaching, and a great student experience. ACT’s Bill is set to undermine and devastate everything good that these institutions do. The Bill will remove the right of students to ensure that there is a mandated student representative organization on their campus,” says NZUSA co-President Max Hardy.</p>
<p>National should look at ways to strengthen associations and their work, but instead National is supporting an ACT Party Bill that will do the opposite,” says Hardy.</p>
<p>“Students care about the quality of their education, the services they receive, and the independent representation they need and deserve. If passed, this Bill will wreck services for students on campus, take the heart out of student life, undermine an independent representative voice, and downgrade the quality of New Zealand’s tertiary education system,” says NZUSA co-President David Do.</p>
<p>Today’s events [1] will follow various rallies around the country [2]</p>
<p>Hundreds of students protested Nationals continuing support of the Bill when the Prime</p>

<p>Minister visited Otago University on the 5th</p>
<p>Hundreds of students rallied at Lincoln University against the Bill on the 11th, and students at</p>
<p>Auckland University protested the Prime Minister there.</p>
<p>Students also rallied outside the National party conference in Wellington this past Saturday</p>
<p>“National still has an opportunity to put forward a reasonable and more enduring alternative to ACT&#39;s extreme Bill, so that freedom of association is ensured and associations can continue the valuable services and representation they provide for students everyday,” says Do.</p>
<p>“Students are urging National to listen to the 98% of submissions opposing the Bill and put forward a better alternative to ACT’s Bill. Lets work together on what students want, not what ACT wants,” concludes Do.</p>
