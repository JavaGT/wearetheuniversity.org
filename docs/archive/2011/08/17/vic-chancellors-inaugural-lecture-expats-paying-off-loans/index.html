<p><strong>Wednesday, 17 August 2011, 11:04 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Expats paying off loans</p>
<p>New figures from the IRD showing a sustained increase in expat graduates paying off their student loans is great news according to the founder of the Heroic Educated Kiwi Expatriate (HEKE) campaign.</p>
<p>The total amount of gross repayments made directly from overseas-based student loan borrowers to Inland Revenue was $8.9 million for May 2011 and $6.9 million for June 2011—up 45 and 38 percent on those months in 2010.</p>
<p>While the direct impact of the HEKE campaign is unclear, the result of an extra $9 million repaid is encouraging for all New Zealanders, says founder, New Zealander of the Year and Victoria University Professor Sir Paul Callaghan.</p>
<p>The campaign, which asks expat Kiwi graduates to make a significant contribution to the Christchurch earthquake recovery mission by paying back their student loans, coincided with more active targeting of loan defaulters by IRD in recent months.</p>
<p>“By paying off their loans these students are not only making life easier for themselves, they are directly helping New Zealand’s balance sheet by providing a healthy shot of external funds into the country—something we need desperately in the wake of the devastating Christchurch earthquakes.”</p>
<p>He says if the higher level of repayment is sustained, it would represent a significant contribution to New Zealand’s ability to rebuild Christchurch, and shows the things that can be achieved when New Zealanders work together to achieve a goal.</p>
<p>Professor Sir Paul Callaghan will next month deliver a lecture in Wellington about creating a prosperous 21st century New Zealand through investing in science and education.</p>
