<p><strong>Time for Labour to Take Some Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Parliamentary Leader John Boscawen today called on Labour to take responsibility for their part in New Zealand’s record level of youth unemployment after asking Opposition Leader Phil Goff during question time what responsibility he and his colleagues took following their scrapping of the youth minimum wage.</p>
<p>“Labour is quite right to highlight the dramatic growth in youth unemployment, but it is time to accept that they are part of the problem, not the solution. After Labour voted to abolish the youth wage thousands of young people have been cast on the unemployment scrapheap. Mr Goff should reflect on that,” Mr Boscawen said.</p>
<p>“That is why I sought leave of the House today to ask Mr Goff what responsibility he took for New Zealand’s tragically high level of unemployment. He refused to actually answer the question, leaving the House none the wiser about whether he takes any responsibility at all.</p>
<p>“National rightly fought against the scrapping of the youth wage in 2008, which is why it is so disappointing to see the Government refuse to reinstate them, despite unemployment amongst 16 and 17 year olds being higher than in recorded history.</p>
<p>“No amount of taxpayer-funded employment schemes can change the fact that the abolition of the youth minimum wage has priced youth out of the market. Mr Goff and Labour today proved why they are a lost cause on this issue, National should take this opportunity to distance themselves from Labour’s failure and agree to reinstate the youth wage immediately,” Mr Boscawen said.</p>
