<p><strong>Friday, 19 August 2011, 2:27 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY</strong></p>
<p><strong>An address by Rt Hon Winston Peters at AMI Netball Stadium</strong></p>
<p><strong>44 Northcote Rd Takapuna, Friday August 19th at 1.00pm</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>“Plan Or Perish – There is No Choice”</em></strong></p>
<p>It would be good to stand up here and say how wonderful things are in the land of the long white cloud.</p>
<p>By nature, most of us are optimists and always try to look on the bright side of life. Our generation was a lucky one.</p>
<p>Although our childhood was tough growing up on a farm milking cows, we always seemed to have a lot of fun and plenty of laughs.</p>
<p>We cannot remember a time when the family was rolling in cash but there was always enough to feed and clothe us – all eleven of us children.</p>
<p>We were educated and made our way in the world.</p>
<p>It makes one weep to see what is happening in our country now.</p>
<p>For nearly thirty years New Zealand has been creating a young underclass that could one day explode like they have in the riots in Britain.</p>
<p>There always was going to be a day of reckoning and now it is upon us.</p>
<p>The riots in Britain are not simply a failure of policing. They are a symptom of the failure of irresponsible capitalism and unfocused welfarism.</p>
<p>Britain is an economy of massive inequality.</p>
<p>The inequality of incomes, wealth and opportunity is the worst it has been in nigh on 90 years.</p>
<p>The wealth of Britain&#39;s richest 1000 people rose by 30% last year in the throes of a credit crunch. Britain has a lost generation about which it has done far too little.</p>

<p>What of New Zealand? A number of the features just described have been present here for some time.</p>
<p>Last year those on our rich list enjoyed wealth growth of 20%.</p>
<p>The gap between our rich and poor has been growing over the last 25 years.</p>
<p>And the present government rather than addressing the symptoms is just adding to them.</p>
<p>A day of reckoning has arrived on many accounts. Accounting for the past, securing the future. That&#39;s what the 2011 election is going to be about.</p>
<p>Well before the fanfare of the National party conference we pointed out the neglected areas of youth employment and trade training.</p>
<p>Unemployment in the 15-19 year old bracket is 27.6 percent. In the 15-24yr olds it is about 18 percent.</p>
<p>In some areas such as Northland the unemployment rate is much worse. No country can afford such a shameful outcome.</p>
<p>We have a generation of unwanted teenagers on the streets and some people in official places wonder why there is a strong culture of offending and drunkenness.</p>
<p>Add to this some teen pregnancies, the option of a life on the domestic purposes benefit and a series of boyfriends who have learned to accept a lifestyle that involves anything and everything except work.</p>
<p>We have advocated programmes to throw open the doors of every trade training establishment in the country and drag them inside. That’s once we have taught them to read and write.</p>
<p>For those employers willing to take on a young person and train them, we suggest that the government consider paying an incentive in a system that works like this.</p>
<p>A young person receiving the dole would be offered a job with training. The firm would pay wages and would receive a top up from the dole payment.</p>
<p>There would be a carrot and stick for the young person. The carrot would be training and some wages.</p>
<p>The stick would be no dole without taking part in the programme.</p>
<p>Now this scheme would not suddenly solve the problem of youth unemployment but it would be a start.</p>
<p>It does not involve food coupons or making women with babies work at non-existent jobs.</p>
<p>New Zealand First also believes that it is pointless announcing big training programmes without the jobs to match.</p>
<p>Unless of course we are continuing to train young people to work in Australia.</p>
<p>That is the greatest challenge – the creation of jobs. The statement in the Budget that 171,000 new jobs were being created is a lie.</p>
<p>Hundreds of jobs are being lost every week.</p>
<p>You know that buried underneath all the spin and bulldust pouring out of the Beehive there is a sense of denial.</p>
<p>From the prime minister down there is an overwhelming silence about the true reasons for the state of the world economy.</p>
<p>It has been caused by greed, speculation and corruption.</p>
<p><strong>The culprits are these - and we”ll list them.</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Futures traders</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Sub-prime mortgage manipulators</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Foreign exchange speculators</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Shonky finance houses</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Shonky insurance companies</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Greedy bankers</strong></p>
<p>This financial crisis was not caused by ordinary people.</p>
<p>It was caused by irresponsible capitalism and the greedy capitalists who ran the system.</p>
<p>In the United States the government is pumping created money into the rotten system to keep it afloat.</p>
<p>If and when it stops unemployment in the United States is expected to read 30 percent!</p>
<p>That is horrifying. We are on the verge of the world’s biggest depression and financial chaos.</p>
<p>Governments throughout the Western world are in trouble because they have pumped trillions of dollars into their shonky banking systems.</p>
<p>In New Zealand we are a bit better off and it has nothing to do with John Key or Bill English.</p>
<p>You can thank Michael Cullen – who was mercilessly targeted by the National party for not handing tax cuts to the rich.</p>
<p>Cullen’s prudence has been undermined by giving the rich tax cuts and lifting GST to pay for them.</p>
<p>These are the facts. John Key and Bill English know as much about running an economy as Rodney Hide knows about ballroom dancing.</p>
<p>They go into a spin and then drop their partners on their heads!</p>
<p>And talking about spin – all the spin in the world won’t make the problems caused by some finance companies go away.</p>
<p>Thousands of elderly investors have collectively lost billions of dollars through the failure of a number of these companies.</p>
<p>Taxpayers are also taking a big hit. The government poured $1.8 billion dollars into South Canterbury Finance.</p>
<p>The latest report on that sorry business says the government will get back only $600 million.</p>
<p>So, $1.2 billion down the gurgler. This money is of course, sucked from somewhere else.</p>
<p>It’s an indictment on our society that billions of dollars can be poured into finance companies while thousands of school children go to school hungry.</p>
<p>The people who built this nation must be spinning in their graves.</p>
<p>Although all the news this week has been about the young, New Zealand First has remained aware of the needs of senior citizens.</p>
<p>We are alert and vigilant as the propaganda pours out about how the aged are a burden and somehow they should keep working at non-existent jobs to keep the economy afloat.</p>
<p>Make no mistake a government led by John Key and Don Brash will soon target senior citizens.</p>
<p>Sure – Mr Key has said he won’t cut super but remember he also said he would not raise GST.</p>
<p>Some of you may have already noticed that the method of calculating national superannuation was subtly changed after this government came to office in 2008.</p>
<p>Guess which way super went with this subtle change?</p>
<p>That’s right – it went down just like it always does when these subtle changes are made.</p>
<p>Let me remind you that the only political party defending senior citizens is New Zealand First and we have the record to prove it.</p>
<p>If by some strange quirk of fate New Zealand First left the political scene it would be all over for the elderly.</p>
<p>The status of senior citizens would change.</p>
<p>They would “officially” be designated as a burden on society.</p>
<p>Make no mistake there are a lot of highly paid people in Wellington in Treasury and other places of privilege who believe that money spent on pensioners is wasted.</p>
<p>New Zealand First has always respected senior citizens.</p>
<p>We have kept the pension at 66 percent of the net average wage while the others tried to cut it. And we believe it is an entitlement – not state charity.</p>
<p>We have a policy of one free medical check a year and doctors’ visits capped at $10 after that.</p>
<p>This policy will save expensive hospital care later on.</p>
<p><strong>Just a reminder - New Zealand First brought in the SuperGold card giving access to free off peak public transport on the buses, trains and ferries.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We know that there has been huge support for this initiative from seniors on the North Shore and throughout New Zealand.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It has been life changing for tens of thousands of elderly, allowing far easier and less costly travel for those who deserve it.</strong></p>
<p>We also have a policy of extending the SuperGold card to cover a ten percent discount in electricity prices for over 65s, and by winter 2012.</p>
<p>This was announced earlier this year at the GreyPower annual convention.</p>
<p>New Zealand First is the only party to have kept trying to prepare for the retirement of the baby boomers.</p>
<p>We tried to bring in a compulsory pension scheme – paid for by tax cuts in 1997.</p>
<p>Our political enemies poured scorn on us. We hate to say we told you so but we told you so!</p>
<p>We would not be in this mess today. Since 1997 and over those lost last thirteen years Australia saved over a trillion dollars. We’ve saved very little.</p>
<p>Now for something different.</p>
<p>Let’s look ahead to the election. It’s time for you to make a statement about the state of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It’s all very simple.</p>
<p>It’s what we call a win-win situation.</p>
<p>We stand on our record.</p>
<p>- Getting rid of the Surtax</p>
<p>- Increasing Super to 66%.</p>
<p>- Bringing in the Gold Card</p>
<p>- and much more</p>
<p>You Party vote New Zealand First.</p>
<p>We win. You win.</p>
