<p>Long working hours can lead to alcohol addictions</p>
<p>A University of Otago, Christchurch, study has found that working at least 50 hours a week increases the risk of alcohol problems by up to three times.</p>
<p>The study used data from the Christchurch Health and Development Study which has followed more than 1000 people born in Christchurch in 1977 through to age 30.</p>
<p>The article has recently been accepted for publication by the journal ‘Addiction’.</p>
<p>Lead author Dr Sheree Gibb says the study aimed to examine whether working hours were related to alcohol problems in early adulthood.</p>
<p>Data from more than 1000 participants at ages 25 and 30 showed a significant association between longer working hours and alcohol-related problems.</p>
<p>Longer working hours were associated with higher levels of alcohol problems including frequent alcohol use and alcohol abuse/dependence. People who worked 50 hours or longer on average a week were 1.8 to 3.3 times more likely to have alcohol-related problems than those who were not working, and about 1.2 to 1.5 times more likely to have alcohol-related problems than those who worked between 30 and 49 hours per week.</p>
<p>The higher risk of alcohol abuse for those who worked longer hours was evident in both men and women.</p>
<p>Dr Gibb says that this finding may suggest a need for consideration of policies and programmes targeted at individuals who work long hours, with the aim of reducing rates of alcohol-related problems amongst this group.</p>
