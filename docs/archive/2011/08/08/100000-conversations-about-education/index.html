<p><strong>100,000 conversations about education</strong></p>
<p>A campaign to get people talking about quality public education in early childhood centres and primary schools aims to generate 100,000 community conversations around the country.</p>
<p><em>Speak Up for Education</em> is being run by NZEI Te Riu Roa which represents 50,000 teachers and support staff in schools and ECE centres.</p>
<p>NZEI President Ian Leckie says the aim is to get schools, centres and communities to talk about what’s fantastic about our education system as well as highlighting what’s needed to have every child succeed in it.</p>
<p>He says 85% of New Zealand students are already doing well, early childhood centres are highly rated internationally and New Zealand students are among the top four readers in the world. They also do very well at science and maths.</p>
<p>“However we need strategies to engage with the children that are missing out because of poverty, family violence and transience. If we want our country to prosper, develop economically, and create new jobs, education is our best investment”.</p>
<p>“To achieve this we need more investment and encourage a system that fosters diversity and difference in the way children learn and grow. A narrow one-size-fits all standards-based system is not where we need to be heading in the 21st century,” he says.</p>
<p><em>Speak Up for Education</em> is being officially launched today (Tuesday 9 August) at Fairburn School in Otahuhu, Auckland. The campaign includes a major advertising campaign as well as nationwide school and community-based meetings to encourage teachers, parents and communities to talk about New Zealand’s world class education system.</p>
<p>There are also events and activities planned at other schools and centres around the country.</p>
