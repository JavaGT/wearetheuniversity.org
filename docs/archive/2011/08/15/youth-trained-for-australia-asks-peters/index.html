<p><strong>Youth Trained For Australia? Asks Peters</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First has asked the government if it is going to train young people to work in Australia as jobs in New Zealand are disappearing weekly.</p>
<p>Rt. Hon Winston Peters says everyone supports the idea of training teenagers because there is a huge unemployment problem but suspects the prime minister’s announcement yesterday is more about the election than the jobless.</p>
<p>“It’s all very well to perform in front of a National party audience but it’s quite another task to produce jobs for the young people. For soaring unemployment and teen pregnancies this was another crude dog whistle.</p>
<p>After over eleven years, nine in opposition, National now has half a plan for sky rocketing out of work youth.</p>
<p>“Thousands of jobs have disappeared since the Budget when the government fraudulently claimed that another 171,000 jobs would be created over the next four years.</p>
<p>“It appears the only choice that many young people will have now will be to train here, then join the hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders already working in Australia.</p>
<p>“’The government should be dealing with the overall effects of its policies on employment as well as training youth,” said Mr. Peters.</p>
