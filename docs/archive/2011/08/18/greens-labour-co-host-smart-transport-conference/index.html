<p>&quot;New Zealanders want and need smart green transport investment,&quot; said Green Party transport spokesperson Gareth Hughes.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government continues to waste billions on new motorways, but there are transport alternatives that deliver healthier and more vibrant communities and cheaper, easier and greener ways of getting around.</p>
<p>&quot;We invited the Minister of Transport Steven Joyce, or other representatives from the National party, to attend the conference, but unfortunately they declined, I think because they don&#39;t want to hear that their motorway plans aren&#39;t smart.</p>
<p>&quot;Smarter transport will be better for our economy and create more jobs and it is also better for our environment,&quot; said Mr Hughes.</p>
<p>&quot;Out of the approximately 3 billion dollars that this Government has allocated to transport projects across New Zealand, only 0.7% goes into public transport infrastructure. For a country that prides itself on being at the forefront of global innovation and conservation, this is simply unacceptable,&quot; said Labour list MP based in Auckland Central, Jacinda Ardern.</p>
<p>&quot;Public transportation in New Zealand has long been neglected and it&#39;s important that we start looking at ways in which we can build smarter transport networks in order to boost economic competitiveness and productivity.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time that the Government realised that investing into smarter transport solutions could have some positive long-term effects. Not only are we investing in infrastructure which will make our cities more liveable, we&#39;re also preserving New Zealand&#39;s environment and living up to our clean, green image&quot; said Ms Ardern.</p>
