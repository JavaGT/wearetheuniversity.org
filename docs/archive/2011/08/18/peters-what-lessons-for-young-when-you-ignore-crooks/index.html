<p><strong>EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY</strong></p>
<p>Extracts from a speech by Rt Hon Winston Peters to a meeting at 247 Edmonton Road Te Atatu 10.00 am 18 August 2011</p>
<p><strong><em>“What Lessons For The Young When You Ignore The Crooks?”</em></strong></p>
<p>“The election year gimmicks are starting to pour out of the Beehive.</p>
<p>One of the cruelest was the big hoax launched by the prime minister at the weekend. The government is mounting a punitive campaign against unemployed teenagers who have committed the crime of being unemployed.</p>
<p>New Zealand First supports any sensible measure to train young people and get them into work.</p>
<p>We agree with the truth in the old saying that the devil finds work for idle hands. But let’s look at the bigger picture.</p>
<p>The community organisations that are supposed to help with the Government&#39;s youth welfare changes say their funding is being cut and they cannot meet the new demands without more money.</p>
<p>It’s been reported that several agencies that provide job training to teenagers said funding cuts had already been confirmed and others were in the pipeline.</p>
<p>They were confused about with the Government announcement and worried about the uncertainty over future money.</p>
<p>There was also universal concern about a lack of jobs available for young people.</p>
<p>Let’s face it.</p>
<p>Jobs are vanishing in this country faster than the fans leaving the Don Brash/Rodney Hide fan club.</p>
<p>Every day we hear of another firm cutting back or closing down.</p>
<p>Since the government announced in the Budget it would be creating 171,000 jobs over the next four years, at least 3,000 jobs have disappeared.</p>

<p>We don’t know where the extra jobs are coming from – unless John Key is building another two or three thousand cycle tracks in locations yet to be announced.</p>
<p>Perhaps he’s going to buy 171,000 bicycles to go with all these new jobs. These young people could get fit biking to work!</p>
<p>Or – they might have a better chance selling the bikes and putting the money towards a plane fare to Australia because there is a better chance of landing a job there.</p>
<p>About half a million Kiwis are already there.</p>
<p>You don’t hear much coming out of the Beehive these days about New Zealand achieving parity with Australia.</p>
<p>That line of propaganda has gone quiet as we slowly sink further in the mire.</p>
<p>You see this is a government with few ideas, little regard for humanity and an obsession with filling the coffers of the very rich.</p>
<p>The poor have their place at the bottom of the heap in New Zealand and this government will do everything in its power to keep them there.</p>
<p>The equation is simple. You cannot have some very rich people without having a lot of very poor people.</p>
<p>That’s the way the latest form of capitalism works.</p>
<p>Just look at the United States of America.</p>
<p>America and many of its western allies are donkey deep in debt. It’s going to impact on all of us.</p>
<p>Guess who caused this debt?</p>
<p>It wasn’t the government and it wasn’t ordinary Americans trying to get on with their lives.</p>
<p>It was caused by the bankers, the financiers, the speculators, the futures traders, the currency speculators, the sub-prime mortgage packagers.</p>
<p>The guilty ones wore suits to work and regarded themselves as the pillars of society and the protectors of capitalism.</p>
<p>They were the biggest shysters ever inflicted on a suffering public.</p>
<p>We have had a few of them here.</p>
<p>A good example was here this week in Telecom’s campaign purportedly in support of the All Blacks where they advocated sporting fans to engage in abstinence.</p>
<p>What an irony!</p>
<p>Here’s Telecom asking New Zealanders not to do what they have been doing to New Zealanders for the past 21 years.</p>
<p>The sooner these monopolists are regulated the better.</p>
<p>They’ve ripped off New Zealand businesses and consumers for years while governments turned a blind eye.</p>
<p>Look at the collapsed finance companies in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Ask yourself how many of these shysters are behind bars.</p>
<p>Ask yourself how many of them are living in flash houses with plenty of money in family trusts while thousands of old people kiss their savings goodbye.</p>
<p>New Zealand First believes in the principles of a fair society with equal opportunity for all.</p>
<p>Most of the governments in our history books went along with this.</p>
<p>How is it that we, in a land of plenty, tolerate a social system that allows children to go to school hungry. What have we come to?</p>
<p>Perhaps we can understand this happening in dysfunctional families but it is accurately reported that many thousands of children are in this plight.</p>
<p>They are caught in a poverty trap that starts with unemployment.</p>
<p>Unemployment is the most corrosive acid eating away at the fabric of our society.</p>
<p>Nothing is more important than finding useful employment for families.</p>
<p>It is demeaning for the family breadwinner to stand in a dole queue.</p>
<p>And we would point out to this government that unemployment is not a crime – the crime belongs to the politicians who bury their heads in the sand and just look after their mates.</p>
<p>We regularly go to South Auckland. We go there to find out what is happening and what the people are thinking.</p>
<p>WE don’t go there for photo opportunities like some other politicians.</p>
<p>What we have found is that the people are thinking about jobs.</p>
<p>We in New Zealand First are taking their views on board.</p>
<p>We know that the top priority of the next government will be to provide jobs and to try to create what they call a level playing field.</p>
<p>The ideas are coming. We’ve put some forward and we are always ready and willing to listen.</p>
<p>Our society is worth saving – even when the National party and its clingons do their best to wreck it.</p>
<p>Let me give you this assurance for the election. If we win – you will win.</p>
<p>But this can only happen if you give a tick. And that tick must surely go to New Zealand First.</p>
<p>We win – you win.”</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
