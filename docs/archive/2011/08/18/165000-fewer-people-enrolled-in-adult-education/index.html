<p>165,000 fewer people enrolled in adult education</p>
<p>Adult Community Education is withering away with 165,000 fewer people enrolled in ACE courses at schools and community groups than in 2009, Labour Tertiary Education spokesperson David Shearer says.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Government&#39;s funding cuts have decimated Adult Community Education with the number of school providers dropping from 212 to just 23 since funding cuts came into force,&quot; David Shearer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some regions now have no access to Adult Community Education and in areas such as Northland, where unemployment is the highest in the country, there is just one school provider.</p>
<p>&quot;We should be encouraging people to take up training not making it harder for them,&quot; David Sharer said. &quot;Night school has been an important option for those looking to up-skill and is a much-loved part of New Zealand culture.</p>
<p>&quot;Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce claims adult education was about indulging people&#39;s hobbies, he could not have been more wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;Since National cut funding for Adult Community Education courses in sign language, maritime safety and Mandarin, a subject the Prime Minister himself has encouraged New Zealanders to take up, have all been cut.</p>
<p>&quot;Adult education has enormous benefits for a small cost, but thanks to National fewer and fewer people and communities are able to benefit from it,&quot; David Shearer said.</p>
