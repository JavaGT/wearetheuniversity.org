<p>Christchurch Earthquake bulletin edition 100</p>
<p>The Labour Party&#39;s Christchurch electorate MPs, Clayton Cosgrove (Waimakariri), Ruth Dyson (Port Hills), Lianne Dalziel (Christchurch East) and Brendon Burns (Christchurch Central) produce this regular bulletin to keep people in their electorates and media informed about what is happening at grass roots level.</p>
<p>CLAYTON COSGROVE: It&#39;s good to see --- after three years --- the beginnings of a breakthrough in terms of developing new affordable land for residential purposes in Kaiapoi and western Christchurch. I welcome Environment Minister Nick Smith&#39;s visit yesterday and his commitment that the Government will use its extensive powers under the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act if local authorities and the airport company don&#39;t get the ball rolling themselves. I believe this would be an appropriate use of the powers. I don&#39;t totally agree with Mr Smith --- I can&#39;t see why he needs to wait a month. The Government could either use its powers now, or throw its support behind my Member&#39;s Bill, which has been around since 2009, and which could get through the House in a couple of days with government support. The land is needed urgently so people can plan an affordable future in Kaiapoi, Harewood, Gardiners Road and Hussey Road areas, without absurd arguments over noise. My Bill would allow development of land to go ahead, without prejudicing the airport&#39;s interests. Following the red-zoning of 860 properties in Kaiapoi, it is important to release as much good building land as possible.</p>

<p>RUTH DYSON: Well, it feels like a week of broken promises sadly, with the residential red zone homes no longer able to claim their legitimate alterations as promised by Gerry Brownlee, and our rock fall risk home folk having to wait for zone colours rather than just waiting for the risk to be remediated. We need some honest and open talk in these tough times. However, another light shines for our small business people with a wonderful message from my colleague Jacinda Ardern, who set up the sister suburb website of support. A friend of hers has an e-commerce programme that makes it really quick and easy for people to sell their product online and he is offering it free to 100 Christchurch businesses. Thank you so much! The website is http//<a href="http://www.dremus.com/">www.dremus.com/</a> and I can give you the code to get the Christchurch free offer if you contact me. I will be advertising this to all my business associations and market stall holders. It&#39;s great!</p>
<p>LIANNE DALZIEL: Following on from the success of the Bexley Garage Sale, where a number of Bexley households held their own garage sale on the same day and at the same time, the Horseshoe Lake has been spurred into action. Saturday 10 September, starting at 7am, is the day where you get to help this red zone move on and move out. There are bargains to be had and they would appreciate your support. Their move is your gain! The starting point is 116 New Brighton Rd and you can pick up your list of addresses for the Horseshoe Lake Garage Sale. This is also a chance for people to come and see the conditions people have been living in for a year. I am sure you will want to be generous.</p>
