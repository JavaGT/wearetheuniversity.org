<p><strong>Chief Justice returns for Harkness Henry Lecture at Waikato University</strong></p>
<p>The Right Honourable Chief Justice Dame Sian Elias will be the guest speaker at the 2011 Harkness Henry Lecture being held at the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>Dame Siam studied law at the University of Auckland, graduating with a Bachelor of Law with Honours, and was admitted to the Bar in 1970. She gained a Master of the Science of Law from Stanford University, before starting in practice in 1972. She was appointed a Queen&#39;s Counsel in 1988, a judge of the High Court in 1995 and became Chief Justice in 1999</p>
<p>The University of Waikato started the inaugural Harkness Henry Lecturers in 1992 with the aim to address issues relating to the development of jurisprudence in New Zealand. This year’s lecture takes place at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts on September 12.</p>
<p>Harkness Henry and Co, a leading Hamilton law firm, in conjunction with Te Piringa Faculty of Law, sponsor on an annual basis the public lectures, which are delivered by a person distinguished within his or her field. Lectures are well attended by senior members of the judiciary, the local bar, practitioners, academics and the public.</p>
<p>This is the first time in the series a previous speaker has been invited back. Dame Sian spoke about public law issues in 1996 and will be the 20th speaker since the series began.</p>
<p>&quot;It’s always a distinct honor to have Dame Sian back, especially in her capacity as Chief Justice of New Zealand, as she is such a fundamental leader within the legal community,” says Law School Dean Professor Brad Morse.</p>

<p>“The Harkness Lectures have continued to grow each year in importance and have become a real standout on the Hamilton legal calendar.”</p>
<p>“Te Piringa Faculty of Law has committed to becoming the best law school in the country and our commitment to the Harkness Henry Lectures and the caliber of speaker we continue to attract is proof of this.”</p>
<p>Harkness Henry Lectures are traditionally the lead article in the subsequent Waikato Law Review. Other notable Harkness Henry Lecture series participants include Dame Sylvia Cartwright, Sir Thomas Eichelbaum and Sir Robin Cooke.</p>
<p>The lecture takes place at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts on Monday September 12, starting at 6.15pm. The lecture is free and open to the public.</p>
