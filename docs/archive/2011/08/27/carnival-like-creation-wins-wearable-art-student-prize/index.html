<p>Carnival-like creation wins wearable art student prize</p>
<p>A “dreamlike” creation by third year fashion design student Sophie Littin has triumphed over international entries to win the student design award at the 2011 Brancott Estate World of WearableArt Awards Show.</p>
<p>The awards, which celebrate the best in creative design from around the world, were presented at a star-studded ceremony in Wellington tonight (Friday).</p>
<p>It is the second consecutive year that a student from Massey University’s College of Creative Arts has been awarded the Shell-sponsored Student Design Award worth $5000, following Luka Mues’ success in the same category last year.</p>
<p>Ms Littin’s entry titled The Greatest Show evokes a circus theme. It was made using wood, paint, fabric and even a converted birdcage, and depicts a mysteriously dreamlike lady unashamedly accompanied by a freak show.</p>
<p>It was awarded top prize ahead of multiple student entries from China, India and the UK.</p>
<p>Her entry, earned another $2500, when it was judged runner-up in the Tourism New Zealand Avant Garde Section of the annual Awards extravaganza.</p>
<p>WOW competition director Heather Palmer described this section of the awards as “where art and fashion collide.</p>
<p>These designs are revolutionary, extravagant and extrovert. The shapes of this year’s designs are beautiful and eclectic, with designs including material such as; bird cages; aluminium tubing; and even 271 Barbie dolls.”</p>
<p>Massey fashion design student Katie Collier won $2500 for being runner up in the CentrePort Illumination Illusion section for her artistically macabre creation Exquisite Corpse.</p>

<p>Fashion design lecturer Sue Prescott was given an honourable mention for her entry Everyday Eros.</p>
<p>Ms Littin, like Mr Mues before her, has taken up scholarship to study for a semester at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco as part of a student exchange programme.</p>
<p>The exchange scholarship, which has been funded by the charitable arm of global telecommunications company AT&amp;T provides her with another $2500, a place at the academy and her entry to the Wearable Art Awards.</p>
<p>A student from the San Francisco University will spend a semester at Massey in Wellington to complete the exchange.</p>
