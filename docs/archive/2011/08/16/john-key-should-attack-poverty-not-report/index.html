<p><strong>John Key should attack poverty not report</strong></p>
<p>John Key should apologise for rubbishing a report that highlights the economic cost of child poverty in New Zealand said the Green Party today.</p>
<p>During question time in Parliament today John Key labelled a report commissioned by Every Child Counts and written by Infometrics that calculates the cost of child poverty to the nation at around six billion dollars a year as “rubbish”.</p>
<p>“John Key took an unnecessarily hostile and aggressive stance on a serious issue that affects over 270,000 Kiwi kids,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>“There is a consensus amongst organisations who work in this area that not acting to reduce child poverty carries a significant economic cost to the country.</p>
<p>“John Key should attack the causes of poverty, not reports that highlight its economic cost to the country.</p>
<p>“Not a single child will be better off as a result of the Prime Minister attacking the Every Child Counts report. This is not a constructive approach.</p>
<p>“Rather than attacking a good report the Government ought to be looking at ways to reduce child poverty,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
<p>The Green Party&#39;s solutions to child poverty were: 1) Make <em>Working for Families</em> work for every low-income family; 2) Provide better study support for sole parents and beneficiaries; 3) Raise the minimum wage to help working parents; and 4) make sure rental properties are warm and healthy for kids.</p>
<p>Mrs Turei said the Green Party&#39;s solutions to bring 100,000 children out of poverty would cost $360m per year, or less than 0.3 percent of GDP.</p>

<p>“The Green Party&#39;s plan shows there are easy, affordable, practical solutions that will make a huge dent in our child poverty statistics, and help to ensure that hundreds of thousands of kiwi kids get the chances they deserve,” said Ms Turei.</p>
