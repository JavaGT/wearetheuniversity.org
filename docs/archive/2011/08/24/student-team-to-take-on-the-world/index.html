<p><strong>Wednesday, 24 August 2011, 3:07 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Student team to take on the world</p>
<p>A Victoria University team is heading to the US with their solar-powered bach to compete in the US Department of Energy 2011 Solar Decathlon.</p>
<p>The team is the first finalist ever from the Southern Hemisphere in the prestigious and highly anticipated international competition.</p>
<p>The Solar Decathlon competition challenges university teams from around the world to design, build and operate solar-powered houses that are cost-effective, energy-efficient and attractive.</p>
<p>The Victoria team&#39;s entry into the competition - the Meridian First Light house - was assembled on Wellington&#39;s waterfront earlier this year to a fantastic public response. More than 20,000 people toured through the house over the 18-day opening period.</p>
<p>The house travelled from Wellington to Washington DC over sea and land for a month to reach the competition site. The team, led by students from Victoria&#39;s School of Architecture will now join the house in the US, their journey a lot quicker by flight.</p>
<p>The team will assemble the house in less than seven days on the National Mall&#39;s West Potomac Park before competing in a series of ten contests. These contests challenge the teams to run their houses entirely from the energy collected from the sun&#39;s energy.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re incredibly proud of the house and the team, it&#39;s been two years of hard work but we are so excited to compete on the world stage,&quot; says team member Nick Officer. The team has tough competition and hard work ahead of them but they have high hopes.</p>
<p>Nick says: &quot;We&#39;re going to show the world what we&#39;re made of and we plan to win.&quot;</p>
<p>The competition takes place over 21 days, the New Zealand team will compete against university teams from the US, Canada, China and Belgium.<br>ends</p>
