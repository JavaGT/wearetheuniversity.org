<p><strong>Thursday, 4 August 2011, 3:39 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>On the news that the VSM aka Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill is one step closer to being passed, the Otago University Students’ Association have ramped up their efforts to show the government that this Bill does not have the support of those it affects, and that it should be up to the students to decide how their associations are run and funded.</p>
<p>Logan Edgar, President of the OUSA, last night announced plans for a peaceful protest timed for the opening of the new Robertson Library, part of the University of Otago’s College of Education.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister, John Key, is expected to attend the ceremonies and we feel this would be the best time to get it across that VSM is not the right way to go about changing how students’ associations function.” Says Edgar, “We have the support of our local Green party MP and Co-leader, Metiria Turei, as well as Labour MPs, Clare Curran, Pete Hodgson and candidate David Clark, who hope to attend the event.”</p>
<p>The protesters will gather from 10.30am outside the library on Union Street East, with students asked to attend and show their support while OUSA Executive members hand out plenty of Heather Roy pictures to rip up as they please.</p>
<p>“Even though it’s had to be a bit last minute we’ve managed to get a load of people behind us thanks to Facebook,” Edgar continues, ”and we’re expecting a big turn out to show that Scarfies and students don’t want to see cuts to the diverse range of services available to them when they come to our great University of Otago!” He goes on to say, “It’s a JOKE that it could go through, the government haven’t listened to the 98% of submissions that were against it, and National is going against what it said before the election as well as what their local MP Michael Woodhouse said to our faces.”</p>

<p>Green Party Co-Leader, Metiria Turei, supports the OUSA and says, “What National has done goes against their election promises and shows they’re happy to breach the trust of young New Zealanders. I will endeavour to attend this Friday as a public display of my support of the OUSA and their campaign against VSM.”</p>
<p>We at the OUSA invite any other students’ organisations that feel strongly about this supporting this protest to get involved around the country!</p>
