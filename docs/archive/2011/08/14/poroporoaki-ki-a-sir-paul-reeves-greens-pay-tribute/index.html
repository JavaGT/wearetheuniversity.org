<p>Poroporoaki ki a Sir Paul Reeves: Greens pay tribute</p>
<p>The Green Party today pays respect to Sir Paul Reeves, the first Maori Governor General and former Archbishop of the Anglican Church.</p>
<p>“It was with great sadness that we learnt of Sir Paul Reeves’ passing this morning,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>“Sir Paul broke through many barriers to achieve what he did in his life, particularly because he lived through a period of overt racism in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Perhaps as a result, he was always a staunch advocate for those living in poverty and for peace and justice.</p>
<p>“In recent years he did great work to advance the Treaty Settlement process for his people.</p>
<p>“We will always be grateful for his advocacy and compassion,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
<p>As well as being Governor General from 1985-1990, Sir Paul Reeves had been chairman of the Nelson Mandela Trust and chairman of the Fiji Constitution Review Commission. Most recently he was chancellor of the Auckland University of Technology.</p>
<p>“We extend our deepest sympathy to his whanau and join the nation in mourning his death,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
