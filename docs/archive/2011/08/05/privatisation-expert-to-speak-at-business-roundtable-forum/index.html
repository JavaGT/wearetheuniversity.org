<p><strong>Privatisation Expert to Speak at Business Roundtable Forum</strong></p>
<p><em>Global Trends In Privatisation: Lessons for Maximising Economic gains</em></p>
<p>US-based privatisation expert Professor William Megginson will address an audience of chief executives, politicians and academics at a CEO forum hosted by the New Zealand Business Roundtable in Wellington on Monday 8 August at 5.30pm.</p>
<p>Business Roundtable executive director Roger Kerr described Professor Megginson as one of the world’s leading academic authorities and researchers on privatisation of state-owned enterprises. He said the visit is of particular interest given the government’s stated intention to sell shareholdings in some state assets.</p>
<p>Professor Megginson is Professor and Rainbolt Chair in Finance at the University of Oklahoma’s Michael F. Price College of Business, and was named a George Lynn Cross Research Professor in April 2010. He is also executive director of <em>Privatisation Barometer,</em> a thinktank promoting privatisation choices based on sound research.</p>
<p>His research has been frequently cited in academic and professional publications including the <em>Journal of Economic Literature</em>, the <em>Journal of Finance</em>, the <em>Journal of Financial Economics</em>, the <em>Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis</em>, and <em>Foreign Policy</em>. Articles he has written have been downloaded over 37,000 times from the Social Sciences Research Network, and his books and articles have been cited over 7,700 times.</p>
<p>Professor Megginson has served as a privatisation consultant for the New York Stock Exchange, the OECD, the IMF, the World Federation of Exchanges, and the World Bank. Prior to entering academia in 1986, he worked as a petroleum chemist at the world’s largest styrene monomer plant and at the largest independent petroleum refinery in the United States.</p>
