<p>Restructuring of RTLB service not a done deal</p>
<p>The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa says the Minister of Education is riding rough-shod over the concerns of specialist learning and behaviour teachers by suggesting the restructuring of their service is a done deal.</p>
<p>There are more than 700 Resource Teachers of Learning and Behaviour who work in schools throughout the country, giving support to help them deal with students with challenging and difficult behaviour.</p>
<p>NZEI says the Minister of Education is suggesting that the restructuring of the service has been completed when in fact consultations are still underway.</p>
<p>NZEI President Ian Leckie says there are still significant issues being sorted out around their employment and which schools they will actually be based in.</p>
<p>“These teachers have been facing a lot of uncertainty and have not yet had any guarantees or assurances over their future employment conditions. To have the Minister making comments before the process is finalised is not helpful.”</p>
