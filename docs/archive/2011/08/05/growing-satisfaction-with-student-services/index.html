<p><strong>Friday, 5 August 2011, 4:04 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University">Massey University</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Growing satisfaction with student services</strong></p>
<p>More than 88 per cent of students who responded to the University&#39;s student experience survey this year rate services as good or very good – the best result since the survey began in 2002.</p>
<p>The survey covers all administration and support services for students, and responses are from a widely representative sample of the student body.</p>
<p>Student management director Dr Pat Sandbrook says the overall results, based on 7200 responses, are very positive, with good/very good rating of 88.3 per cent on the five-point scale up nearly three percentage points on last year&#39;s 85.4 per cent.</p>
<p>&quot;It is pleasing that results are strong in areas in which the University has recently been putting extra effort, based on previous years’ feedback from students,&quot; Dr Sandbrook says. &quot;These include helping new students to get started, upgrading computing services on campus and improving on-line information.</p>
<p>&quot;Massey University is committed to providing the very best working and learning environment possible. Listening to students and acting on what we are told is a key part of that commitment.</p>
<p>&quot;Students generally regard Massey staff as helpful and supportive. The services most directly related to students’ study, such as Library, learning resources and interaction with staff and other students are most important, and receive strong ratings. Opportunities for improvement include further developing usability of the website, the learning experience for on-line courses and, for research students, work space, financial aid and research community. A number of other improvement areas are also identified.</p>
<p>&quot;The University is keen to see the areas where improvements can still be made,&quot; Dr Sandbrook says. Detailed results from the survey are currently being distributed to service managers across the University. The information becomes part of the University’s regular service review and planning processes.</p>
<p>The Student Experience Survey is conducted during the first semester each year.</p>
<p>A summary of the results has been emailed to those who participated and may be found here: <a href="http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/about-massey/surveys/survey-student-experience-services/2011-ses.cfm">http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/about-massey/surveys/survey-student-experience-services/2011-ses.cfm</a>  </p>
