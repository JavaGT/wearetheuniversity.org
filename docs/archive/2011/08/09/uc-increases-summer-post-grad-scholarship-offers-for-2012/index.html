<p><strong>Tuesday, 9 August 2011, 2:46 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>**University of Canterbury significantly increases its summer scholarships and postgraduate scholarships offer in 2012<br>**<br>The University of Canterbury has significantly increased its summer scholarships and postgraduate scholarship funding for 2012.</p>
<p>More Masters and PhD scholarships are now on offer at UC including three new PhD scholarships ($20,000 plus tuition fees waiver each year for three years) and two new Masters scholarships ($12,000 plus tuition fees waiver for one year) to support research undertaken at the Ngai Tahu Research Centre hosted at UC. In addition, there are five new PhD scholarships specifically for earthquake-related research ($20,000 plus tuition fees waiver each year for three years).</p>
<p>The number of UC Summer Scholarships has increased by 47 per cent from 2010-2011 per cent, with a total of 250 UC Summer School scholarships now on offer for 2011-2012.</p>
<p>Recipients of Summer Scholarships receive a $5,000 stipend. This allows them to complete a specific 10-week research project over the summer, under the supervision of an academic staff member. In addition, students will take part in a short research skills workshop (over the equivalent of two days) as part of the scholarship – this will take place in late November 2011.</p>
<p>Approximately 70 per cent of students who complete their summer school research project go on to enrol in postgraduate studies at UC. The majority of the applicants are from UC however the scholarships are open to applicants from outside the University.</p>

<p>“Research is crucial to any university and it is important that we support and develop the next generation of researchers at the University of Canterbury,” said University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor, Dr Rod Carr.</p>
<p>“The Summer Scholarships are an excellent way to develop research skills through completing a specific project within a delineated timeframe and provide students with a ‘taste’ of what postgraduate research might be like prior to enrolling in a postgraduate programme at UC.</p>
<p>“We hope that our additional summer scholarships and postgraduate scholarships will provide an incentive for our undergraduate students to achieve good results and will also attract high-achieving students to the University to undertake their postgraduate studies here with us.”</p>
<p>The list of the available projects for summer scholarship recipients and the application form are available at <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/postgrad/summerschols/index.shtml">http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/postgrad/summerschols/index.shtml</a> .
