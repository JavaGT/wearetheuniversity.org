<p><strong>Tuesday, 9 August 2011, 2:53 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Carol<br>BEAUMONT<br>Consumer Affairs Spokesperson</p>
<p>9 August 2011<br>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Supermarket pricing under scrutiny too</strong></p>
<p>The Government’s acknowledgement that milk pricing needs further scrutiny is welcome given the soaring cost of living New Zealand families are facing, Labour’s Consumer Affairs spokesperson Carol Beaumont said today.</p>
<p>“The cost of milk is something that affects many thousands of families and I am pleased the pressure of Labour and the Greens has finally led to the Government agreeing to an Inquiry by the Commerce Select Committee.”</p>
<p>She said the inquiry, which will not only look at the price of raw milk, but at the prices charged by supermarkets as well, was also an opportunity to test the disquiet felt by both consumers and suppliers regarding the pricing policies of the supermarket duopoly.</p>
<p>“Up until now the National Government has made no effort to respond to concerns raised by consumers and local producers, other than to suggest they ‘shop around’.</p>
<p>“Hopefully this inquiry will answer the many questions Kiwis have about a product grown in their own country, and identify where the costs are in the supply chain and where the profits are going.</p>
<p>“If it doesn’t provide reassurance for consumers, then it may serve to reinforce calls for actions to increase scrutiny on supermarkets,” Carol Beaumont said.</p>
