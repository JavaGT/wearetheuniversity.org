<p><strong>Monday, 17 October 2011, 2:59 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/We_are_the_University">We are the University</a></strong></p>
<p>Tertiary Education Union joins forces with We are the University in rally and forum</p>
<p>* *</p>
<p>We are the University, with the endorsement of the Tertiary Education Union (TEU) and the Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA) have planned a rally against another 4% fee rise on Monday 17th October. The rally will be followed in the evening by a TEU-led forum on the future of the university. This forum features speakers from the Law and Business schools as well as members of We are the University.</p>
<p>“Every year we see fees rise, while vital services are cut and the value of our degrees diminishes, as they are converted into dollar-signs and the social value of an educated populace is forgotten or ignored. We want to send a clear message to policy-makers and university management to remember who the university is. We are the University, and we will not stand by as they dismantle our education system,” said a spokesperson, Angela Jameson.</p>
<p>Students and staff will stand together in the evening to discuss the role of the university and its future in society.</p>
<p>Jameson said, “We can see that there is a real risk of the university becoming an exclusive and elitist institution which only understands the language of cash. This is immensely troubling and it is not good enough to stand by and let rampant profiteering besmirch the reputation of New Zealand universities as sites of academic extension and freedom of thought.”</p>
<p>*The rally begins at 2pm in the University Quad. *</p>
<p>*The forum begins at 6pm in the Library basement.*</p>
<p>ends</p>
