<p><strong>David PARKER</strong><br>Energy Spokesperson<br>17 October 2011</p>
<p><strong>Volunteers need support not pointless bureaucracy</strong></p>
<p>The response of officials to volunteers has been overly bureaucratic and obstructive, Energy spokesperson David Parker says.</p>
<p>“In places like Maketu the only response to the Rena oil spill has been from volunteers, but instead of helping and guiding them the official response has been bureaucratic and at times obstructive,” David Parker said.</p>
<p>“The volunteers are an essential part of this oil response. It’s what Kiwis do. They pitch in. They need support from Government and officials.</p>
<p>“The volunteers require absorbent material to help soak up the tarry mess. This is not yet being properly distributed and some volunteers are paying for the materials out of their own pockets.</p>
<p>“That is not good enough, and could hold back the clean-up efforts if more oil reaches the beaches in the predicted bad weather This should not be a cost to the volunteers.</p>
<p>“The volunteers are amazing they are the ones who are really making a difference in this clean-up operation.</p>
<p>“John Key might think one person with a bucket and spade doesn’t make a difference but he is wrong. It’s the thousands of individuals who are out there with buckets and spades who are making the biggest difference.</p>
<p>“I understand that officials need to work with the volunteers on safety – but really it’s pretty much just common-sense. You don’t need to tell New Zealanders they shouldn’t eat the oil.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders care passionately about their country and there is no greater example of this than the speed at which people rushed to help</p>
<p>“Labour thanks all the volunteers who are giving up their time to help,” David Parker said.</p>
