<p>In remembrance of Sir Frank Holmes</p>
<p>Victoria University joins with the New Zealand community to commemorate the outstanding contribution of economist and policy adviser Sir Frank Holmes, who sadly passed away today.</p>
<p>Sir Frank taught at Victoria from 1952-67 as a lecturer and then as Macarthy Professor of Economics, returning from 1970-77 as a Professor of Money and Finance. He was knighted in 1975 for services to economics and education and awarded Honorary Doctorates by the University of Otago in 1997 and Victoria in 2004.</p>
<p>“Sir Frank was also a founder of the Institute of Policy Studies at Victoria. His leadership on important economic issues and his public contribution to economic debate and related policy matters will be remembered for generations to come,” Victoria University of Wellington Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says.</p>
<p>“On behalf of his former colleagues and students at Victoria, I would like to extend our sympathies to his family at this time.”</p>
