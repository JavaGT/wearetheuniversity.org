<p>New Events Centre expected to open at UC in February 2012</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury and University of Canterbury Students’ Association are progressing plans to construct a temporary Events Centre in the UCSA carpark on UC’s Ilam campus. The centre still requires a building consent but the University believes it has met all the conditions for a consent to be granted.</p>
<p>The multi-million dollar Events Centre is expected to be open in February of next year and is seen as adding a critical piece of social infrastructure necessary to attract and retain students.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased that planning for the proposed Events Centre is proceeding,” said University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor, Dr Rod Carr. “The Events Centre will provide a wonderful social space for students and the university community in the coming years and I look forward to it opening in time for the start of the 2012 academic year.</p>
<p>“The University and UCSA have worked closely and constructively with Ilam School on the proposed Events Centre and have reached an agreement that the University believes is sensitive and responsive to the needs of the Ilam School community. This has led to an improved overall situation for the school compared to existing permitted use of the UCSA building and surrounds.”</p>
<p>Agreement has been reached that will limit noise during weekdays in term time to levels below that which were previously experienced. The hours during which alcohol can be sold during weekdays in term time have also been restricted beyond the limits allowed under existing licensing conditions.</p>

<p>The University has also agreed, at its expense, to erect a fence along the boundary of Ilam School’s grounds and the University’s grounds to create a sight barrier for the school.</p>
<p>In addition, hosting responsibilities for events held at the proposed Events Centre have been made more explicit and enhanced security responsiveness has been agreed.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to welcoming students to our campus next year and to providing them with great teaching, research and social opportunities during their time with us. We are pleased to be working with UCSA and our community to create new social spaces for our students and our community to enjoy.”</p>
