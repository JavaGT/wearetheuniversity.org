<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Rt. Hon Winston Peters Leader NZ First</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>October 9 2011</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>“Former MP seeks to return”</strong>  </p>
<p>The New Zealand First Whangarei electorate committee has selected Pita Paraone to contest the forthcoming general elections.</p>
<p>Born and bred in Northland Pita returns to the region of his roots to renew his political career after an absence of three years when he first became a New Zealand First list Member of Parliament in 2002 through to 2008 for the Pakuranga electorate.</p>
<p>From a background of Public Service he has held several senior management roles most of which have involved Maori economic and social development. Qualifications from Victoria University, Wellington and the University of Auckland provided the academic qualifications for this involvement.</p>
<p>His tribal affiliations are Ngatihine, Ngatiwhatua and Te Rarawa. He also has English and Irish ancestry. Pita is married to Elva and they have three children and five grandchildren.</p>
<p>Family, Maori economic and social development, rugby, rugby league and tennis are his main interests. He regards himself as a world champion having been a member of the NZ Parliamentary Rugby Team that lifted the Parliamentary Rugby World Cup in 2007.</p>
<p>Pita has previously chaired Te Runanga o Ngatihine and the Northland Polytechnic Council and been an elected member of the Taitokerau Maori Trust Board. He is presently the Chairman of the Waitangi National Trust Board and an appointed member of Sport Northland.</p>

<p>Care for the elderly, security of our nation, investment in health and education, ownership of state assets and compulsory savings are some of the philosophies that he shares with New Zealand First of which he has been a member since 1993.</p>
<p>“New Zealand faces a number of challenges associated with a lower credit rating, high debt, unacceptable levels of unemployment, particularly among Maori and an increasing demand for affordable housing. New Zealand First has the policies and the will to effectively address these issues” he said. “I want to be part of a team that will deliver as an obligation to the people of New Zealand” he added.</p>
