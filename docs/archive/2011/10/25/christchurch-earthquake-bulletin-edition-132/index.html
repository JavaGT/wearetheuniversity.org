<p>Christchurch Earthquake bulletin edition 132</p>
<p>A regular bulletin started by the Labour Party&#39;s Christchurch electorate MPs, Clayton Cosgrove (Waimakariri), Ruth Dyson (Port Hills), Lianne Dalziel (Christchurch East) and Brendon Burns (Christchurch Central) to keep people in their electorates and media informed about what is happening at grass roots level.</p>

<p>CLAYTON COSGROVE: The spirits of Canterbury were lifted, as were all of NZ over the weekend, with a fantastic All Blacks win. Whilst everyone from Canterbury would acknowledge the disappointment in losing the matches that were scheduled to be here because of the earthquake, Cantabrians have got behind the World Cup as enthusiastically as everyone else. The World Cup win has provided some light relief and joy for those in Struggle Street down here. As I went around the traps yesterday people were dusting themselves off from the celebrations of the weekend and many were planning to take their kids to the parade today. The general sentiment is that it has been a hell of a year for this province and the ABs victory together with the way the ABs always pay tribute and acknowledge earthquake victims has been yet another little bit of support that&#39;s helping them through. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll all do our province proud in supporting the parade today.</p>

<p>BRENDON BURNS: Mild spring weather encouraged out the crowds for the annual fair at Holy Trinity, Avonside&#39;s Anglican church on Saturday morning. Despite the sad backdrop - a Mountford-designed church has fallen to the bulldozers - the community was there in force. Avonside/Linwood is one of the poorest communities in New Zealand but it is rich in spirit. Some residents are among those anxiously waiting this week&#39;s promised update on zoning from Minister Brownlee. Let&#39;s hope its news that puts as many people as possible into the picture. Meanwhile, some recognition to demolition contractor Scope for the sensible salvage of Christchurch&#39;s former public library, opposite the central Police Station. There had been a suggestion on Friday that the bulldozers were ripping it apart. In fact all of the stone elements, the copper ventilators, the shaped bricks, the concrete lintels and all of the timber doors and windows of the Armson portion of the library building (the 1875 Venetian Gothic Building which faced onto Cambridge Tce) were salvaged. It took some weeks and that&#39;s a credit to Scope when you consider CERA&#39;s demolition contracts are built around time and cost. Little wonder much precious and eminently salvageable heritage material is carted straight to Mt Burwood (aka the growing landfill).</p>
<p>LIANNE DALZIEL: I continue to have concerns about the lack of attention that has been paid to the &quot;Canterbury Fact Finding Project - consideration of liquefaction &amp; lateral spreading hazards in the zoning and development of: a) the eastern suburbs of Christchurch from 1977 to 22 Feb 2011, and b) Brooklands, Kaiapoi and Kairaki/The Pines from 1977 to 4 Sept 2010&quot;. This report was released on a Friday afternoon - usually code for Ministers wanting to avoid the hard questions - with Hon Nick Smith kicking it for touch until after the election. The report identifies areas that should not have been sub-divided without reference to the liquefaction and lateral spread risks and without providing mitigation. After acknowledging that 20% of consents for subdivisions were granted after the risks were known - parts of my electorate that the report identifies are Bexley South (Pacific Park), Kate Sheppard, Avondale North and the newer Burwood developments that run parallel to ANZAC Drive from New Brighton Rd to Travis Rd, Nick Smith blamed the &quot;politically correct&quot; Resource Management Act. That&#39;s probably not surprising because the government wouldn&#39;t want people thinking they could sue the Council for negligence for allowing development in areas of known risk when the government wants the red zone offers settled. There are questions that must be answered now!</p>
<p>RUTH DYSON: Every Cantabrian had our thoughts turn to Turkey as we heard the news of their massive earthquake and aftershocks, in treacherously cold weather. Rescue efforts will be so challenging and our thoughts remain with the local people. The Rugby World Cup victory has certainly swept the country with the need for something to celebrate felt particularly strongly here. Despite it being an ordinary working day in the middle of the afternoon, I am sure that lots of people will still find their way down to the victory parade this afternoon and celebrate at the Fanzone. All credit to the Council staff for their rapid organization so that we can share in the glory! I enjoyed the opening of Art Nomad in Sumner last evening. This gallery, featuring primarily local artists, was in Redcliffs but has swapped spots with Morgan and Paige to build on the arts precinct feel which is developing in the village. There are magnificent works beautifully displayed, including painting, photos, wooden tables and blown glass. Well worth a visit!</p>
