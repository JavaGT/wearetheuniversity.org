<p><strong>OUSA Announces Top Lecturers</strong></p>
<p>Tonight the Otago University Students’ Association named Otago University’s Top Lecturer for 2011 as voted by the students. This year’s Top Ten list was made of lecturers that go the extra mile, and for students they stick out as being an inspiration during their tertiary education.</p>
<p>“Congratulations to Professor Stringer and Dr. Rutherford, and a huge thanks to all our great lecturers who make Otago University the best place to study in New Zealand!” said Katie Reid, OUSA Education Officer.</p>
<p>The Otago University Vice Chancellor, Professor Harlene Hayne, awarded the 2011 Top Lecturer honour to Professor Mark Stringer on behalf of the OUSA. The award gives students the opportunity to recognise an outstanding lecturer, and this year the Anatomy lecturer from the Otago School of Medical Sciences was a student favourite even having a “Prof. Mark Stringer Appreciation Society” facebook page set up by students.</p>
<p>The OUSA also celebrated, Dr. Gill Rutherford, the winner of The Disability Awareness and Inclusive Teaching Award, also known as the most inclusive lecturer.</p>
<p>“This award recognises excellence in inclusive teaching and a commitment to understanding disability as a human rights issue, thus enriching the Otago experience for students who have a disability, impairment or medical condition. The award honours a university staff member whose teaching and actions exemplify the ideals of inclusivity and advances equity and opportunities for all students”, said Reid.</p>

<p>“The university’s vision and mission is focused on excellent research and teaching; OUSA’s mission is focused on student engagement and to build excellent student services to provide the ultimate student experience. Awards like the OUSA Top Lecturer recognise teaching excellence and help students give their lecturers the kudos they deserve.” said Reid, “It is no wonder that so many Otago lecturers have gone on to win National Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards.”</p>
