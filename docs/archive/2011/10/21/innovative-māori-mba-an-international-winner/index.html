<p><strong>Innovative ‘Māori MBA’ an international winner</strong>  </p>
<p>A unique MBA programme for Māori leaders has won the inaugural MBA Innovation Award offered by the London-based Association of MBAs (AMBA).</p>
<p>Developed to foster indigenous ways of doing business with a collaborative ethos, the programme is a partnership between the University of Waikato Management School and the Waikato-Tainui College for Research and Development at Hopuhopu.</p>
<p>University representatives received the award this week [Wednesday] at the AMBA gala dinner in London.</p>
<p>AMBA is one of three international management education accreditation bodies whose combined accreditations form the prestigious Triple Crown held by a select group of business schools around the world. Waikato Management School is one of only three Australasian business schools to have achieved Triple Crown accreditation.</p>
<p>Professor Frank Scrimgeour, Dean of Waikato Management School, said the award is recognition that New Zealand punches above its strength when it comes to new approaches in management education.</p>
<p>&quot;The award endorses our commitment to develop future Māori leaders. It shows that our MBA programme is world class, relevant, and at the forefront of management thinking. And it is recognition that Waikato Management School is held in high esteem by our international peers.&quot;</p>
<p>The Waikato MBA delivered at the Waikato-Tainui College combines academic rigour and traditional Māori ways of learning, and offers a contextualised curriculum that is focused on being culturally responsive, transformational and challenging.</p>

<p>“The vision for this MBA programme is to advance Māori leadership within the global business environment.” says the College’s Academic Director Dr Sarah-Jane Tiakiwai. “Winning the MBA Innovation Award is an incredible honour and a testament to the success of our collaboration.”</p>
<p>The programme accepted its first intake of 24 students in April this year, and is delivered in a wānanga environment at the Waikato-Tainui College. It promotes collaborative learning with guest speakers and mentoring support from Māori leaders, including Waikato MBA Māori graduates.</p>
