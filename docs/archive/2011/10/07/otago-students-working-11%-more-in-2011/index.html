<p><strong>Otago students working 11% more in 2011</strong></p>
<p>Otago University students have worked 8,658 worker weeks in 2011 so far up 11% on the 7,794, 2010 figure, according to latest Student Job Search figures released today.</p>
<p>“Student Job Search (SJS) is a fantastic service governed with student input, for students”, said Otago University Students’ Association Welfare Officer Shonelle Eastwood.</p>
<p>“In OUSA’s 2010 student survey SJS was rated as OUSA’s second most important service. That is why we are setting up two ‘SJS Connect’ kiosks in the OUSA reception on Cumberland Street and in the Clubs and Societies Building on Albany Street. These kiosks will remain in operation until the SJS on-line functionality is complete in December”, said Shonelle Eastwood.</p>
<p>“OUSA is focused on maintaining and building on services that provide the ultimate student experience. With the high cost of tertiary study, having access to SJS is a key priority for students”, said Shonelle Eastwood.</p>
<p>To date in 2011 OUSA members have earned $3,889,317 giving our students an extra chance to make the most of their time studying, reduce their student loan and the dependence on the government.</p>
<p>“It’s a service that as students we value highly, and as the students’ association we want to continue to support.” Says Eastwood, “We see it as beneficial to not only our members, but also to the wider Dunedin community and the University itself who often hires via SJS.”</p>
