<p><strong>Labour&#39;s Tertiary Plan a Clear Contrast</strong></p>
<p>7th October 2011</p>
<p>Young Labour welcomes the release of Labour&#39;s tertiary education policy which will give students a clear alternative to the failed approach of the current National Government.</p>
<p>“Labour today announced it would increase university funding, reinstate universal students’ association membership to protect students’ associations, retain the fees maxima scheme to keep fees down, and reinvest in adult education and apprenticeships” says Young Labour President, Ella Hardy.</p>
<p>“Labour&#39;s tertiary policy shows the ways in which this National Government has failed students. From its persistent under funding of the tertiary sector, to its arrogant and ideological assault on student&#39;s associations and representation, this Government has consistently let students down.”</p>
<p>“Labour is committed to investing in students, keeping their education affordable and will return their voice and representation” adds Hardy.</p>
<p>“The new tertiary policy builds on Labour&#39;s commitment to helping students by bringing down the rising cost of living and creating jobs for young people to bring down New Zealand&#39;s high rates of youth unemployment.”</p>
<p>“While the National Government would prefer young people &#39;keep their heads down’ and suffer through the sky rocketing cost of living, and our shameful rates of youth unemployment, Labour is campaigning on a plan to keep every young person in work or study, and bring in a $15 dollar an hour minimum wage so young people are paid a fair wage” concludes Hardy.</p>
