<p><strong>ACT Pays Tribute To Roger Kerr</strong></p>
<p>ACT Leader Dr Don Brash today paid tribute to New Zealand Business Roundtable Executive Director Roger Kerr as an inspirational New Zealander whose substantial contribution to public policy helped shape the New Zealand we have today.</p>
<p>&quot;Roger has made an outstanding contribution to public policy and economic debate in New Zealand and was held in high regard by opponents and supporters alike,&quot; Dr Brash said.</p>
<p>&quot;Roger has been influential in the development of New Zealand&#39;s economic policy for over three decades. He served New Zealand as an advisor to Treasury and to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as serving on the Board of the Electricity Corporation and Victoria University&#39;s Council.</p>
<p>&quot;However Roger will likely be most remembered for the contribution he made as Executive Director of the New Zealand Business Roundtable.</p>
<p>&quot;His contribution to New Zealand was recognised this year when he was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.</p>
<p>&quot;As well as his service to economic and public policy, Roger will be remembered for his unwavering ability to debate the merits of policies and ideas, not the people advocating them.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand is poorer for having lost Roger. My thoughts go to his wife Catherine, his family, and close friends,&quot; Dr Brash said.</p>
