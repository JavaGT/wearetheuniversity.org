<p>In welcoming the workshop participants, the Director of the School of Government, Development and International Affairs, Professor Vijay Naidu, said that this was the first time that USP students would experience such an important skills workshop on negotiation as part of their postgraduate programme.</p>
<p>The two-day workshop was designed to impart practical skills in diplomatic writing and negotiation through a step-by-step preparation for participation in a mock ‘Wellington Conference on Climate Change’. During the training, each student became part of a country or international agency delegation to this mock conference.</p>
<p>On the first day, participants practiced the art of writing Cabinet submissions, preparing briefs for the conference, and writing opening speeches.</p>
<p>After a briefing on international meeting procedures and negotiation styles, the participants on the final day engaged in the ‘Wellington Conference’, delivering opening speeches, participating in corridor and tea-time negotiations, and then delivering delegation positions at the conference table. Ruci Botei ably chaired the mock conference.</p>
<p>The workshop was facilitated by Ambassador Peter Rodgers, a visiting Fellow at the Asia Pacific College of Diplomacy in Canberra.</p>
<p>Ambassador Rodgers commented that the participants were “naturals”, keeping in mind that only one or two in the group had experienced an actual international conference.</p>
<p>The workshop organiser, Associate Professor Greg Fry of the Graduate Studies in Diplomacy and International Affairs programme, said that the feedback from the participants was incredibly positive.</p>
<p>He said that participants gained an appreciation of how such international negotiations work and the confidence to actually participate in negotiations.</p>
