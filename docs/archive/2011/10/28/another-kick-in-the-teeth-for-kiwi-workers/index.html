<p>Another kick in the teeth for Kiwi workers</p>
<p>National&#39;s plans to deal to workers&#39; rights go against international best practice and will do nothing to stimulate our already low-wage economy, says Labour&#39;s spokesperson for Labour Issues, Darien Fenton.</p>
<p>&quot;Slashing collective bargaining provisions won&#39;t create a single job, while removing the requirement to conclude negotiations is likely to result in prolonged industrial disputes with no incentive for either side to settle.<br>&quot;It&#39;s the same old, same old. It is the Employment Contracts Act in drag. These same ideas were tried in the 1990s and they failed.</p>
<p>&quot;Youth unemployment ballooned, wages were cut, and the gap between New Zealand and Australia widened,&quot; Darien Fenton said.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government has no ideas on how to improve wages and productivity, and no ideas on how to improve the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Enabling employers to opt out of multi-employer bargaining will put major agreements at risk in the health sector and in key manufacturing industries such as the Plastics and metals industries.</p>
<p>&quot;And putting workers straight on to individual agreements when they start work is a sop to big businesses already making huge profits, courtesy of hard-working low-paid staff. It will ensure collective agreements are further undermined and workers denied a genuine choice to join a union.</p>
<p>&quot;Allowing bosses to partially reduce pay where employees are taking action such as overtime bans or a work-to-rule during negotiations also weakens the ability of Kiwi workers trying to improve wages and conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;These changes will make it harder for thousands of Kiwis to get a fair deal at work and they will destroy years of working towards improving workplace relationships,&#39; Darien Fenton said.</p>
<p>&quot;With this kind of industrial law in place John Key will have successfully steered the country backwards, with low wages and long hours becoming our point of competitiveness.&quot;</p>
