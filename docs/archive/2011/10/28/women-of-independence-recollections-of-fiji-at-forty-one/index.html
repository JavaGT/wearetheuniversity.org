<p><strong>Friday, 28 October 2011, 3:05 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_Of_The_South_Pacific">University Of The South Pacific</a></strong></p>
<p>28th October, 2011</p>
<p>The Faculty of Arts, Law and Education (FALE) at the University of the South Pacific hosted a featured speaker and a panel discussion to allow women from various walks of life who were actively involved in Independence celebrations to share their recollections of the historic day.</p>
<p>Held at the USP Laucala Campus on 20 October 2011, the discussion allowed the invited panel of guest speakers to speak of their memories of Fiji’s Independence Day in 1970. Those present at the discussion contributed with their personal viewpoints on what independence means to them as women and as citizens of Fiji.</p>
<p>Members of the panel (sitting: left to right): Ms Roshni Pal, Dr Shaista Shameem, Mrs Mavis Basawaiya, Dr Claire Slatter and Ms Suliana Siwatibau as the Dean of FALE, Dr Akanisi Kedrayate (standing) concludes the discussion.</p>
<p>The event was part of FALE’s community engagement initiatives. A similar discussion was held last year when FALE organised the inaugural ‘Fiji at Forty’, which showcased recollections from prominent persons who were present during Fiji’s Independence.</p>
<p>The five-member panel included Ms Suliana Siwatibau, Dr Claire Slatter, Mrs Mavis Basawaiya, Dr Shaista Shameen, and Ms Roshni Pal.</p>
<p>The Chief Guest and the featured speaker was the Minister for Women, Culture and Heritage and Social Welfare, Dr Jiko Luveni. She was among the first i-taukei women in the medical profession in Fiji.</p>
<p>Speaking at the discussion, Dr Luveni highlighted the contributions of women over the four decades of Fiji’s independence.</p>

<p>She emphasised that women have always been a great force towards the progress of civilization. Dr Luveni added that society as a whole would not progress without the advancement of women.</p>
<p>“There is evidence of change in the women of Fiji in the past forty-one years of independence as we take ownership of our efforts to upscale the development in our nation. This is most encouraging,” she affirmed.</p>
<p>The Minister described independence as the strength that breeds confidence to create something from nothing and prompts a will to go beyond to reach extraordinary heights.</p>
<p>“When individuals become achievers of their goals, there is multiplier effect on the country. When Fiji gained independence, we took ownership of our destiny. There should be a change in the mindset from complacency to hard work, from welfare to workfare, to prioritise education and to emerge from poverty to gain from the wealth of our natural resources,” she explained.</p>
<p>Dr Luveni stressed that responsibility comes with empowerment and freedom.</p>
<p>“It is our responsibility as strong and independent women to demonstrate in our own lives the potential Fijian women have. We are the role models and mentors for all women,” she added.</p>
<p>A former USP academic and now a peace ambassador, an emotional Ms Siwatibau shared the importance of Independence for women in Fiji. She elaborated that Independence had liberated women to lead their country which is quite positive for countries and societies.</p>
<p>Having taught in Fiji for over 43 years, Mrs Basawaiya recalled her experience of the historic day in 1970. The retired school teacher said that the sight of neatly turned out school students waving the Fiji flag can never be forgotten.</p>
<p>According to Mrs Basawaiya, Fiji has achieved a lot and made rapid progress in many areas since Independence. These include the involvement of women in decision making, combating violence against women and children, and localising skilled jobs.</p>
<p>In moving Fiji forward, Mrs Basawaiya said, “we must exert our energy in nation building and healing so that we can make our nation a plural society and enjoy a land of freedom, hope and glory.”</p>
<p>Another panelist, Dr Shaista Shameem, a human rights advocate and the Associate Professor of Law at the University of Fiji, shared her experience as a school student at that time trying to understand Independence.</p>
<p>Dr Claire Slatter, an academic from the Fiji National University, talked about her recollections of being a young woman studying and graduating in the early days of Fiji’s Independence. Similar reminiscences were made by Ms Roshni Pal, a senior manager at the Fiji National Provident Fund, who was one of the five students chosen to be part of the formalities during Independence celebrations.</p>
<p>In her concluding remarks, the Dean of FALE, Dr Akanisi Kedrayate thanked the distinguished panelists for their diverse viewpoints and informative discussions.</p>
<p>“We can learn from all these experiences and know that we have all come a long way,” she pointed out.</p>
<p>She encouraged those present to work together and make the society a much better place in which to live.</p>
<p>The event was organised by the Associate Dean Research and Graduate Affairs, Dr Mohit Prasad, as part of FALE’s community engagement programme in association with the Gender Studies programme based at the School of Social Sciences.</p>
