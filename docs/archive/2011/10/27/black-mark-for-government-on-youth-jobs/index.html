<p>Black mark for Government on youth jobs</p>
<p>The Prime Minister should be ashamed of a &#39;could do much better&#39; report card that highlights how young Kiwis are still among the most disadvantaged in the Western world when it comes to job opportunities, Labour&#39;s Youth Affairs and Employment spokesperson Jacinda Ardern says.</p>
<p>&quot;The latest NZahead report, from the NZ Institute, gives the Government a &#39;C&#39; for its overall performance.</p>
<p>&quot;Even more significantly, however, the report has also slammed National for making no headway whatsoever in tackling New Zealand&#39;s growing youth unemployment problem. It simply hasn&#39;t done enough for these kids,&quot; Jacinda Ardern said.</p>
<p>&quot;Young people represent almost half of all of this country&#39;s unemployed, the highest share in the OECD.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet National has chosen to ignore the recommendations in the NZ Institute&#39;s &#39;More Ladders, Fewer Snakes&#39; report on youth unemployment, released earlier this year, and it continues to ignore warnings that the consequences of its inaction will have an impact on everyone.</p>
<p>&quot;It is estimated that &#39;disengaged youth&#39; - young people not in work, education or training - cost New Zealand around $900 million a year.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand helping those young people into training or work can boost the economy by millions.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour knows that. We have plans to create jobs, promote apprenticeships and to provide transition services and training for school leavers.</p>
<p>&quot;Our youth skills and employment package focuses on students before they leave school and on the 24,000 teenagers currently not in work, education or training.</p>
<p>&quot;These kids are our future. It is a tragedy that their skills are being wasted,&quot; Jacinda Ardern said.</p>
