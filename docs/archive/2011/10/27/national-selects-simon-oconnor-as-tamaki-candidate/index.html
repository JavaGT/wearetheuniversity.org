<p><strong>Thursday, 27 October 2011, 9:12 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hunt: National Selects Simon O&#39;Connor as Tamaki Candidate</p>
<p>National&#39;s Tamaki Electorate Chair Andrew Hunt is pleased to announce that Simon O&#39;Connor will be the Party&#39;s Tamaki candidate at the November 26 Election.</p>
<p>&quot;Tamaki is an important seat for the National Party and that was reflected in the high calibre of candidates who put their names forward.&quot;</p>
<p>A shortened selection process has been conducted after Tamaki MP Allan Peachey announced his decision to stand aside at the election.</p>
<p>&quot;Our electorate team knows Simon will make an excellent representative who will continue to work hard for our community.</p>
<p>O&#39;Connor is delighted to have won selection, and enters the race taking nothing for granted. He has also paid tribute to the other nominees, because it is never easy to stand for public office.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an electorate which deserves a strong voice within the National caucus. I will work hard to earn the trust and respect of our community, and know I have fairly large boots to fill,&quot; says O&#39;Connor.</p>
<p>Simon is an active member of the National Party. He has held numerous offices, and managed a variety of projects for the Party. Among them, he has been a Deputy Regional Chair, an Electorate Chair, Campaign Manager, and strategist, and a list candidate in 2008.</p>
<p>Simon is currently a Contracts Manager for Southern Cross Health Society, negotiating agreements with medical specialists and hospitals around the country. He recently completed a Masters in Political Studies at the University of Auckland with First Class Honours. He holds three other degrees and trained for several years to be a Catholic Priest. Though he completed his training, he did not seek ordination. Instead, he sought wider involvement in the community to make a practical, hands-on difference.</p>
