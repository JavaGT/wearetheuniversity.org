<p><strong>Lincoln University acknowledges the passing of Christopher Doig</strong></p>
<p>Lincoln University acknowledges the passing of Christopher Doig CNZM, OBE, MA (Hons), a man who had exhibited that distinctive Kiwi versatility and ‘can do’ attitude in two separate realms – the arts and sport.</p>
<p>Throughout his career Christopher has given New Zealanders an extraordinarily rich endowment of pleasure, entertainment and opportunity for creative expression and self-fulfilment.</p>
<p>After years as a professional opera singer, Christopher went on to achieve prominence as a sports administrator heading New Zealand Cricket for six years. He was instrumental in the establishment of the sport’s national High Performance Centre at Lincoln University.</p>
<p>New Zealand Cricket’s outdoor playing and training facilities comprise of a three-ground complex at Lincoln University, including the Bert Sutcliffe Oval and the high-quality practice facilities. The facilities also include a six-line indoor centre that is used for winter trainings.</p>
<p>In 2008 Lincoln University honoured Christopher with the degree Doctor of Social Science honoris causa, the first time this particular degree had been conferred.</p>
<p>This comfortable blending of the arts and sport expressed in the career of Christopher Doig resonates easily with Lincoln University where the emphasis is on interdisciplinary and the cross-fertilisation of fields of endeavour.</p>
<p>”We have lost a genuine and passionate man today which will not only be felt in New Zealand but will also be felt around the world. The arts, opera in particular, and sport are the twin poles of Christopher’s life and he is a household name in both fields. Our sympathy is with his family and friends at this time,” says Vice-Chancellor, Professor Roger Field.</p>
