<p>Te Ururoa Flavell<br>Maori Party WHIP | MP for Waiariki<br>October 5 2011</p>
<p><strong>Discriminatory justice system evident in Waiariki says Flavell</strong></p>
<p>Maori Party MP for Waiariki, Te Ururoa Flavell, is endorsing his Party’s key election policy to conduct a full review of the justice system, following the outcome of two similar cases in his electorate which saw two young Maori discharged with convictions in one case, and a non-Maori discharged without conviction in the another.</p>
<p>“There are two cases in my electorate which have very similar circumstances, however, the outcome for both is contrasting.” Said Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>“There is no denying that the case in which two Rotorua Boys High School students were convicted following the death of their friend in a jetski accident is a tragedy. The judge described the circumstances as a burden they will carry for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>“Similarly, in the case against a 65 year old man in Tauranga following the death of his friend in a boating accident, he was spared the conviction with the judge saying the loss of his friend is a significant burden to carry and that alone is a deterrent in itself.”</p>
<p>&quot;Both cases share a similar heartbreak, with the sad loss of a friend through a disaster neither party had anticipated&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But there is a difference in the sentencing outcomes which has left questions in the minds of my constituents. In the case of the two boys, they are left with a criminal record, yet the Tauranga man is spared.</p>
<p>“Why the difference?” Asks Flavell.</p>

<p>“The statements by the Judges in both cases were almost parallel so I can’t help but question the Justice system in cases like these.” Ends Flavell</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>A New Zealand study conducted over 21 years found that Maori offenders had higher rates of conviction than non-Maori offenders of the same socio-economic background and with the same history of self-reported offending. The results showed that Maori were 2.1 to 2.6 times more likely to be convicted than non-Maori with the same history of self-reported offending.
