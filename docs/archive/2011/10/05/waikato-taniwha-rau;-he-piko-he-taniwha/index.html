<p>The Hon Tariana Turia<br>Maori Party Co-Leader | MP for Te Tai Hauauru</p>
<p><strong>Waikato Taniwha Rau; He Piko He Taniwha</strong></p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m very sad to learn today of the passing of Tiki Green&quot; said Tariana Turia of Waikato master carver, fisherman and kaumatua Richard Tiki Green (also known as Dick).</p>
<p>&quot;He was a man who was passionate about his awa, and rangatahi - a man who devoted his life to the preservation of Tainui tikanga and kawa, through the art of carving and the establishment of &#39;Kanae Kakariki&#39;.</p>
<p>Tiki established Kanae Kakariki as a hands on training programme for working-age Maori people in Huntly and Ngaruawahia. The programme covered the basic skills required for entry level into fishing or conservation industries.</p>
<p>Raised on the Waikato Awa by his elders, Tiki had a deep affinity for the awa and strongly believed that everyone had a role to play as kaitiaki and this was something he instilled in his graduates.</p>
<p>Tiki came to the fore as a pupil of the late tohunga whakairo Piri Poutapu, and would also himself become a master carver, carving many whare and pou in the Waikato area. Tiki was part of the team that carved the Tainui waka, Tahere Tikitiki II and also helped restore, Te Winika, giving his only daughter the same name.</p>
<p>Originally from Maniapoto Tiki met his wife, Billie, on a trip to Huntly in 1958. Tiki and Billie had 6 children; 1 daughter and 5 sons, 3 of whom have already passed on through motor accidents. Tiki will be laid to rest with his sons on Friday morning at Taupiri Maunga.</p>
<p>Richard Tiki Green was a keeper of Tainui tikanga and Kingitanga knowledge and was one of only a handful of people who have a full facial taa moko.</p>
<p>&quot;He was a man with a generous spirit and a generous heart and I will miss him dearly as I know his whanau, hapu and iwi will too&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
