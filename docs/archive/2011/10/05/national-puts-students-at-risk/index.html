<p><strong>Wednesday, 5 October 2011, 5:31 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Sue<br>Moroney<br>Education spokesperson<br>5 October 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>National puts students at risk</strong></p>
<p>The Government is putting school children at risk by determining that its classrooms have to be 90% below the earthquake-proof standards, before they will act to safeguard children and teachers, Labour Education spokesperson Sue Moroney says.</p>
<p>“The Government is not taking earthquake risk issues seriously if they are prepared to keep children in buildings that are 83% below earthquake standards,” Sue Moroney said.</p>
<p>“The Minister is taking a gamble that is high-risk in the aftermath of the Christchurch earthquakes.</p>
<p>“This morning Wellington East Girls College confirmed that after finding a building at the school was listed at just 17 per cent of acceptable building standards. The school contacted the Ministry of Education which told it the school would not be required to evacuate students unless the building fell below 10 per cent of building standards.</p>
<p>“That is quite frankly appalling. The Minister and Ministry need to working on good quality guidelines for schools and to support them in having safe schools.</p>
<p>“Allowing students to be in potentially unsafe buildings is simply ludicrous.</p>
<p>“If the Minister of Education Anne Tolley has an additional $2.5 million that she can overpay private schools. Then she has money that she can put towards improving safety at schools.</p>
<p>“Parents should be horrified by her lax attitude towards student safety,” Sue Moroney said.</p>
