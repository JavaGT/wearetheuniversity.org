<p><strong>OUSA backs new SJS with ‘SJS Connect’ Kiosks on campus</strong></p>
<p>The Otago University Students’ Association is working to help Student Job Search (SJS) stay connected with students as the service moves to an online and call centre-based operation.</p>
<p>“We believe the SJS service helps to reduce student debt, and manage the increased costs of living for students during their tertiary study period.” Says Shonelle Eastwood, OUSA Welfare Officer, “Our student survey proved SJS was an important service to students. It was rated as having high usage and high satisfaction along with excellent service.”</p>
<p>“OUSA is helping out as SJS switches over to a fully operational online and call centre based process which may take a month or two. By having two ‘SJS Connect’ kiosks in our OUSA receptions, students can come in to browse and free-call SJS about potential jobs as they make the transition.” Says Eastwood, “With the new improved website and marketing campaign we’re confident SJS will continue to be the easiest, and best place for students to get jobs for a bit of extra cash while they study.”</p>
<p>Student Job Search has over 8000 active OUSA members browsing jobs, and of those who are referred 68% receive work doing anything from one off experiments to graduate roles. On average SJS’s Dunedin office had 300 students coming through per week during 2010, and by having the new ‘SJS Connect’ kiosks (each set up with a laptop and phone) we aim to make sure our students remain connected with this vital service.</p>
<p>“Thanks to OUSA being run by students for students, we spotted that the change over period might cause some issues for our members.” Says Miss. Eastwood; “So we’ve stepped in early to make sure they’ve still got easy access to the SJS service.”</p>
