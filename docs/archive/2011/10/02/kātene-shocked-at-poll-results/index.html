<p><strong>MEDIA STATEMENT</strong><br><strong>Rāhui Kātene</strong></p>

<p><strong>Kātene shocked at poll results</strong></p>
<p>Māori Party MP for Te Tai Tonga Rāhui Kātene has responded positively to latest results showing a 7% difference between her and the Labour contender for the seat.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s actually given our campaign team a shock - it&#39;s so different to what we&#39;re seeing on the ground - but it&#39;s also really invigorating to know that we have to work even harder to get our message out&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just yesterday I was out door-knocking over a thousand households in Christchurch and the support I am receiving is just outstanding. I am humbled by the feedback from the people on the streets that I am doing a great job and representing their issues in Parliament effectively.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The phone polling in other areas, especially Wellington, also confirms I am the preferred candidate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right throughout the electorate people are telling me that they are pleased to have their MP sitting at the decision-making table, and advocating for Te Tai Tonga at the highest levels. They want Te Tai Tonga to have influence, and for their MP to represent that in government&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been a hardworking and diligent MP for Te Tai Tonga in the face of several major crises issues such as the Christchurch earthquake, the Pike River Mine tragedy and the global financial downturn. I have been right there for our people throughout all these issues, whether on the ground or in Parliament.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m determined to ensure I continue to be the very best advocate I can for the people of Te Tai Tonga and once again earn the privilege of their vote.&quot;</p>
