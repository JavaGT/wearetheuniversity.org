<p><strong>Otago University students say CHEERS to the Top Ten Lecturers!</strong></p>
<p>OUSA Teaching Awards Top Ten lecturers list is out! Students have nominated lecturers that went above and beyond the calling of their educational duty and the 10 best have been found.</p>
<p>“OUSA thanks all of the great lecturers who inspire us.” Said Katie Reid, OUSA Education Officer.</p>
<p>The overall top lecturer will be announced at an awards ceremony to be held next Thursday. The Vice Chancellor, Professor Harlene Hayne, will be making presentations along with the OUSA. OUSA will also be naming the winner of the most inclusive lecturer, which is a disability-based award ‘The Disability Awareness and Inclusive Teaching Award’.</p>
<p>“This award recognises excellence in inclusive teaching and a commitment to understanding disability as a human rights issue, thus enriching the Otago experience for students who have a disability, impairment or medical condition. The award honours a university staff member whose teaching and actions exemplify the ideals of inclusivity and advances equity and opportunities for all students”, said Reid.</p>
<p>“The university’s vision and mission is focused on excellent research and teaching; OUSA’s mission is focused on student engagement and to build excellent student services to provide the ultimate student experience. Awards like the OUSA Top Lecturer recognise teaching excellence and help students give their lecturers the kudos they deserve.” said Reid, “It is no wonder that so many Otago lecturers have gone on to win National Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards.”</p>
<p>The awards ceremony will be held at the Otago University Staff Club from 5pm, Thursday the 20th of October.</p>
<p>All media are invited to the award ceremony and are encouraged to get in touch to arrange attendance.</p>
