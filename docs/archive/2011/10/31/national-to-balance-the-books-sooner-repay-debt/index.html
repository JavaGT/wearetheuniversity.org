<p><strong>Monday, 31 October 2011, 9:55 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National to balance the books sooner, repay debt</p>
<p>National is on track to get the Government&#39;s books back to surplus by 2014/15 and start repaying debt when most other countries are still running deficits and borrowing more, National Party Leader John Key and Finance Spokesman Bill English said today.</p>
<p>This is in stark contrast to Labour, whose gimmicks and growing list of expensive promises will create a black hole of more than $16 billion in the government&#39;s accounts over the next four years alone - costing thousands of jobs and pushing up interest rates for families and businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;National has a straightforward and comprehensive plan to build a more competitive economy,&quot; Mr Key said today in launching National&#39;s finance policy in Wellington.</p>
<p>&quot;First, we&#39;re balancing the books sooner by getting back to surplus in three years.</p>
<p>That&#39;s important because it means less debt and lower interest rates for households and businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;The Savings Working Group said getting back to surplus is the most important thing we can do to increase genuine national savings and reduce New Zealand&#39;s longstanding reliance on foreign debt.</p>
<p>&quot;Second, we&#39;re creating incentives for people to work hard, save and get ahead, through changes to tax and welfare.</p>
<p>&quot;And third, we&#39;re building better roads, broadband and other infrastructure so businesses can grow.</p>
<p>&quot;Through these actions, we&#39;re creating a more competitive economy and backing Kiwis&#39; ability to get out there and take on the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr English confirmed National will keep a tight rein on spending over the next three years to achieve budget surplus, as part of its wider programme of responsible and balanced economic management.</p>
<p>&quot;We will need to work hard and remain focused to get back to surplus,&quot; Mr English said. &quot;National will stick to its annual operating allowances of no more than $800 million in 2012/13 and 2013/14, and $1.2 billion in 2014/15.</p>
<p>&quot;This new spending will go to health, education and a few carefully-targeted initiatives.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no new capital allowances until Budget 2017. Instead, the estimated $5-$7 billion proceeds from the mixed ownership model will be invested in National&#39;s new Future Investment Fund for priority new assets like modern schools, hospital redevelopments and transport projects.</p>
<p>&quot;We will make these investments without having to borrow from foreign lenders,&quot; Mr English said. &quot;That&#39;s important when the assets we are managing on behalf of taxpayers are forecast to increase by $22 billion to $267 billion over the next four years.</p>
<p>Mr Key and Mr English said National will continue with its clear plan to build a more competitive economy that sells more to the rest of the world, creates new jobs and provides higher incomes for New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;By contrast, it&#39;s the same old Labour wanting to take New Zealand backwards with more borrowing, more spending, more taxes and more costs on businesses,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>&quot;These kinds of policies have failed under Labour&#39;s watch in the past and they would fail again - at the cost of jobs and living standards for New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;The answer to a debt problem is not to run up more debt,&quot; Mr Key and Mr English said.</p>
