<p><strong>Returning UC students to benefit from post-earthquake generosity</strong></p>
<p>The University of Canterbury is to offer 95 new scholarships of $2000 each to returning students in 2012, thanks to the generous donations of UC alumni and friends to the UC Foundation’s 2011 Earthquake Scholarships Appeal.</p>
<p>The UC Foundation launched the Earthquake Scholarships Appeal in April as a way for UC alumni and friends to help quake-affected students.</p>
<p>The response was overwhelmingly positive with $270,000 having been raised, exceeding the original fundraising target by more than a third.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled and delighted by the generous support that has been shown to UC students in response to our appeal,” said UC Foundation Chair, Barry Ramsay. “The total amount raised is almost eight times more than the amount raised in previous alumni appeals.</p>
<p>“Not all of the funds raised are to be given out as scholarships – a number of donors have specified that their gifts be directed to particular purposes, or colleges, departments or programmes and we will be facilitating those targeted donations.</p>
<p>“We told donors that they had the opportunity to make a huge difference for UC students affected by the earthquake and help us to keep our best and brightest students at the University of Canterbury and they have responded with a very meaningful show of support for UC students and the University itself.”</p>
<p>University of Canterbury Colleges and the School of Law have been asked to nominate students that they feel are deserving of the scholarships. Scholarships have been allocated to the Colleges and School of Law on a pro rata basis. Both domestic and international students are eligible for the scholarships.</p>

<p>The scholarships will be awarded based on academic merit to high-performing students, with nominators having being asked to take into account the whole situation of the student, including any significant impacts suffered or special contributions made by the student in response to the earthquakes this year.</p>
<p>The University has also provided additional financial support to postgraduate students. Existing scholarships have been extended for students whose research projects were delayed and disrupted by the quakes, and 250 new summer research scholarships of $5,000 each will be awarded to honours and postgraduate students this year.</p>
<p>“These scholarships are an important acknowledgment of our current students and the significant resilience that they have shown this year,” said Dr Rod Carr. “They are our leaders of the future and we need them to stay and help rebuild the new city that Christchurch will become.”</p>
<p>To be eligible for one of the 95 UC Foundation scholarships students must have been enrolled fulltime in 2011 in a UC undergraduate programme and must be enrolled in a fulltime programme of study in 2012. Preference will be given to students enrolling in their second year in 2012. Other students enrolled full-time during 2011 and continuing with fulltime undergraduate study in 2012 are also eligible to receive a scholarship.</p>
<p>Nominations must be received by UC’s Scholarships Office by 28 October.</p>
