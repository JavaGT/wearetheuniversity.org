<p><strong>Tuesday, 18 October 2011, 9:31 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_Of_The_South_Pacific">University Of The South Pacific</a></strong></p>
<p>17th October, 2011<br>The USP Family Day 2011 marked across the eight campuses on 1 October has been labeled as the ‘most successful’ to date.</p>
<p>USP campuses in Samoa, Tuvalu, Nauru, the Solomon Islands, Republic of Marshall Islands, and the three campuses in Fiji- Laucala, Lautoka and Labasa marked the fun-filled day.</p>
<p>Like previous years, the response to the day was extremely positive where people had fun, caught up with colleagues, and met new people and made new friends.</p>
<p>The Laucala Campus Family Fun Day was opened by the Deputy Vice-chancellor, Learning, Teaching and Student Services (LTSS), Professor Susan Kelly with encouraging words for everyone present to make the most of the beautiful opportunity.</p>
<p>Professor Kelly said that the Fun Day is a happy event which happens concurrently with other USP campuses around the region.<br>“I encourage everyone to join in these fun Family Day activities and to be an active member of the USP Family,” she said.</p>
<p>We are all very fortunate to be part of a University that understands the value of events where staff can bring their children and partners and just enjoy activities, good company and fun,” she added.</p>
<p>Children got to enjoy their favorite sack race and treasure hunt competitions, which is also popular with adults. The egg and spoon race, and the Pacific’s very own traditional game of coconut scraping and basket weaving competition took the Family Day to another level of excitement.</p>
<p>Group Manager, Campus Life, Mr Glenn Pope who led the organization of the event commented that 2011 Family Day was the most successful to date with more USP Campuses participating and generated larger crowd with increased activities.<br>“Over 1500 members of USP Family attended the Laucala Campus Family Day and were treated a range of rides (ferries wheel, bouncy castles, merry-go-around rides, paddle boat rides, popcorn, candy floss and Ice-cone, live music). The cultural performances by Tokelauan and Tongan groups added color and energy to the day,” Mr Pope said.</p>

<p>“The event was first introduced in 2010 and is about celebrating the concept of USP Family and providing an informal setting for USP students and staff with young families to enjoy each other’s company and appreciate the value of being part of USP across the Region,” he added.</p>
<p>The Family Day was received very well by the participants and according to the feedback by many people that turned up, the event was very well organized.<br>USP Student Association Tokelauan Student representative, Ms Jewel Toloa commended Campus Life for putting up a ‘great’ family day for the USP community.<br>“Our Tokelauan family really enjoyed it! If you noticed, we were the last to leave the grounds on that day. We continued to play touch rugby and had more games in the evening. It was so much fun,” she said.</p>
<p>USP Properties &amp; Facilities staff, Ms Rina Antonio-Jang said that the family day gave her the opportunity to meet with other USP staff and friends.<br>“My family had planned to spend at least two hours but we got carried away with so much fun that we left after six hours, enjoying every minute if it,” Ms Antonio-Jang explained.</p>
<p>Another staff, Ms Patrina Dumaru, from the School of Social Sciences shared similar sentiments. Ms Dumaru said the rides, pop corn and candy floss, water activities, games and awesome band – all by the sea was really very special.<br>“Sharing all that with other USP staff and their families made it a very successful family ‘soqo’ – of course the Tongans and Tokelauans have to be especially thanked for adding the Polynesian touch with dance on the day,” she excitingly shared.</p>
<p>The event ended with a display by fire fighters of National Fire Authority and their Smoke House display. Everyone had a great time, and it was fantastic to see the energy that is generated when the community gets together.</p>
