<p>UC wins a Green Gown Award for Okeover Stream Restoration Project</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury was honoured with a Green Gown Award at the recent ACTS (Australasian Campuses Towards Sustainability) conference in Adelaide for the restoration of the Okeover stream which runs through its Ilam campus.</p>
<p>The Green Gown Awards originated in the UK in 2004, and were established in Australasia last year by ACTS to acknowledge the sustainability efforts and initiatives undertaken by tertiary campuses in Australia and New Zealand. Last year the UC gained a Highly Commended in the Student Initiatives and Campaigns category for student competition, eco-my-flat.</p>
<p>This year the UC Sustainability Office entered the Okeover Stream Restoration and Community Engagement Project in the Continuous Improvement – Specific Area category. The University of Canterbury’s Sustainability Advocate Matt Morris and Waste Reduction Educator Sharon McIver were delighted to be at the awards to receive the recycled glass trophy on behalf of the university and all those who have had a stake in the project.</p>
<p>The judges commented that the project is “an excellent example of long term continuous improvement and shows strong environmental commitment in a local area. This initiative could be highly replicable in a similar ecological area and would be a great teaching tool for future students!”</p>
<p>They also noted that the 15 year project shows strong environmental commitment in a local area with good social engagement and high impact with the local community from an aesthetical and recreation perspective.</p>
