<p><strong>Thursday, 10 November 2011, 4:02 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hon Steven Joyce</strong><br><strong>National Party</strong><br><strong>Campaign Chair</strong>  </p>
<p>10 November 2011 <strong>Media Statement</strong></p>
<p><strong>Labour = less jobs</strong></p>
<p>Following a politically-panicked Labour Party prescription for the economy would destroy thousands of jobs across New Zealand during a time when the world economy is vulnerable, says National Party Campaign Chair Steven Joyce.</p>
<p>The National Party has today released a new campaign flyer with the title “Labour = Less Jobs”, which highlights a number of the ways in which a Labour government would add unaffordable costs across the economy, and directly reduce the number of jobs in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Mr Joyce has so far counted a total of 10 big extra costs Labour would add onto the economy if it had the chance to become the government after November 26.</p>
<p>The list is:</p>
<p>• A capital gains tax on all businesses<br>• A more than doubling of employer Kiwisaver costs<br>• Irrigation taxes<br>• Accelerated ETS tax on the farming sector<br>• Cancellation of the 90-day trial period<br>• A return to 1970s industrial relations policies<br>• An immediate 15 per cent increase in the minimum wage<br>• A wind-back of National’s ACC changes, meaning higher ACC levies<br>• Extra transport charges<br>• Lifting interest rates by borrowing an additional $15.6 billion over four years</p>
<p>“The Labour Party either doesn’t understand the direct relationship between higher costs and a less competitive economy, or it wants to pretend the relationship doesn’t exist in a desperate attempt to attract votes at the expense New Zealand&#39;s economic recovery,” says Mr Joyce.</p>
<p>“Labour are running a ‘head in the sand’ approach to jobs. Phil Goff and David Cunliffe are trying to pretend you can keep whacking small businesses with extra costs, with no effect. Patently they are wrong, and this brochure reminds New Zealanders where their policies would lead.”</p>
<p>The leaflet will be distributed by National Party supporters around the country in the coming days.</p>
