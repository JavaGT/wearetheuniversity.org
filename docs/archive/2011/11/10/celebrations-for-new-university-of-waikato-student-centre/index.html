<p><strong>Two-part celebrations to mark opening of new University of Waikato Student Centre</strong></p>
<p>The new University of Waikato Student Centre was officially opened yesterday in a two-part celebration to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>Governor-General Lt Gen the Rt Hon Sir Jerry Mateparae, a Waikato alumnus, officially opened the multifunctional facility on 9 November.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato Student Centre will be the social heart of the campus with places to meet, cafés, shops and relaxation spaces, and a central point for student services on campus.</p>
<p>About 150 people attended the opening, including representatives from the university, industry and the community.</p>
<p>University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says the opening of the Student Centre is a significant occasion for the university.</p>
<p>“The conception and completion of this building is another demonstration of our commitment to the delivery of a world-class education while providing our students with a dynamic university experience.”</p>
<p>University Chancellor Jim Bolger and Waikato Student Union president Deni Tokunai also spoke on behalf of the university.</p>
<p>At dawn, a blessing ceremony was held to lift the tapu from the Student Centre which also saw the unveiling of <em>Aurei</em> – a sculpture specially made to stand at the main entrance of the Student Centre.</p>
<p>Sculpted by New Zealand artist and Waikato alumnus Rangi Kipa, <em>Aurei</em> represents a famous proverbial saying from King Pōtatau, the first Māori king: There is but one eye of the needle through which the white, black and red threads must pass.</p>

<p>The sculpture suggests the spirit of unity and the common pursuit of knowledge and understanding, symbolically tying people, relationships, kaupapa and ideologies together.</p>
<p>The $30 million Student Centre project, which has taken three years to complete, has seen the university’s library updated and expanded.</p>
<p>Last year, it was awarded a prestigious 5 Green Star rating from the New Zealand Green Building Council, the first five-star project in the Waikato region. It also won the Best Use Of Glass Award in the Window Association of New Zealand’s Design Flair Awards held in June.</p>
<p>The 5 Green Star rating recognises the environmental and sustainable features of the Student Centre design which include photovoltaic panels, self-monitoring lighting and energy efficient heating systems.</p>
