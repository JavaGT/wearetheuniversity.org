<p><strong>Labour’s health agenda unveiled</strong></p>
<p>Next Monday AUT University hosts Labour Health spokesperson, Grant Robertson, where he will discuss Labour’s health agenda.</p>
<p>Robertson is one of several speakers to feature in the 2011 AUT Public Lecture Series, hosted by Max Abbott, Professor of Psychology and Public Health and Dean of AUT’s Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences. Health Minister Hon. Tony Ryall also recently spoke as part of the series.</p>
<p>This seminar is the final in the lecture series which has so far addressed a range of issues pertinent to social development and overall health and wellbeing of the nation, says Professor Abbott.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand faces enormous challenges in meeting the health needs of an ageing, ethnically diverse population. Part of a university’s statutory responsibility is to be an informed critic and conscience of society, subsequently, the purpose of this lecture series is to address priority issues affecting the health sector and generate public debate.”</p>
<p>Robertson is the Labour Member of Parliament for Wellington Central, the Labour spokesperson for Health and Associate Spokesperson for Arts, Culture and Heritage. He is also a member and Deputy Chairperson of the Health Select Committee.</p>
<p>At the lecture Robertson will discuss Labour’s approach to health - in particular the importance of addressing inequalities, social determinants of health, the need for a long term preventative approach, “and the need for an honest conversation with New Zealanders about the future of healthcare in New Zealand”.<br><strong>Event details</strong>: Monday 14 November, 4.30 – 6.00pm, AUT University North Shore Campus, AF 116, 90 Akoranga Drive, Northcote, Auckland.</p>
