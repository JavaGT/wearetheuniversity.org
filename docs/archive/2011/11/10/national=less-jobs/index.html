<p><strong>Thursday, 10 November 2011, 8:31 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>David<br>CUNLIFFE<br>Finance Spokesperson<br>10 November 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>National=less jobs</strong></p>
<p>National’s economic mismanagement has driven 100,000 Kiwis overseas in search of higher wages and a better life, says Labour’s Finance spokesperson David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“Unless there is a change of direction more talented young Kiwis will leave, our country will get downgraded again, and our future will be truly bleak,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>&quot;Unemployment is up. Tens of thousands more are on the dole. People want to work, but the jobs aren&#39;t there.</p>
<p>“For those who are lucky enough to be in work, the income gap with Australia has widened under National’s watch from $121 a week to $153 a week.</p>
<p>&quot;John Key said he would create more jobs and would close the wage gap.</p>
<p>&quot;He was wrong, but both jobs and wages going backwards are the result of his policy choices.</p>
<p>&quot;If National is re-elected, the same policies will drive the same results. Too many people on the dole, too many people without jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;The exodus will continue, and we will have to fly across the Tasman to visit our children and our grandchildren,&quot; David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“National’s failed trickle-down, muddle-through economics and its determination to create a near slave-wage economy is obviously not working. New Zealanders are voting with their feet in droves and the rating agencies have given them the thumbs down.</p>
<p>“National=less jobs,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
