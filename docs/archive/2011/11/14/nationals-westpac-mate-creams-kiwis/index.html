<p><strong>Monday, 14 November 2011, 3:35 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt. Hon Winston Peters Leader NZ First<br>November 14 2011</strong></p>
<p><strong>National’s Westpac Mate Creams Kiwis</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First says the multi-million dollar pay deal received by the Westpac bank boss shows how the Aussie banks are creaming it at the expense of New Zealanders.</p>
<p>Westpac New Zealand chief executive George Frazis was paid $5.4 million in the year to September, the second year in a row his pay has topped $5m.</p>
<p>The figure likely makes him the highest paid CEO in New Zealand this year.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters says on top of his extortionate pay, Frazis was given a tax cut of more than five thousand dollars a week when the National Party increased GST and gave the rich tax cuts less than two years ago.</p>
<p>“Westpac took $454 million from New Zealand with a profit rise of more than 40 percent. No wonder this bank can afford to give truckloads of money to its New Zealand boss.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says many New Zealanders may not be aware that Westpac handles the government accounts so a lot of its profits are coming straight from taxpayers.</p>
<p>“Westpac enjoys very good relations with the National Party. It has even hired a retiring National cabinet minister to help keep its profits flowing.</p>
<p>“It’s high time Kiwibank was revamped to take over the government accounts and it’s time New Zealand owned a bigger chunk of its own banking system,” says Mr Peters.</p>
