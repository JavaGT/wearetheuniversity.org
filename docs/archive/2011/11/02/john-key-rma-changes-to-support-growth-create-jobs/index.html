<p><strong>Wednesday, 2 November 2011, 11:48 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>RMA changes to support growth, create jobs</p>
<p>Prime Minister and National Party Leader John Key today announced the National Party&#39;s resource management policy, which includes a new six-month time limit on processing consents for medium-sized projects.</p>
<p>&quot;Sensible management of our resources is critical to protecting our environment and building a stronger economy with more real jobs,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
<p>&quot;We know that delays in processing resource consents are a huge frustration for businesses trying to expand, invest and create jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s why National is continuing its hard work to streamline and simplify the Resource Management Act.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Key announced National would establish a six-month time limit for decisions on regional projects such as new subdivisions, retail developments, infrastructure, and industrial developments.</p>
<p>&quot;This is good news for businesses and for our economy because it means notified consents for medium-sized developments are processed quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;It comes on top of National&#39;s first phase of reforms, which reduced costs, uncertainties and delays for those building large national infrastructure and small non-notified consents.&quot;</p>
<p>National&#39;s next phase of reforms would also address the problems identified in the wake of the Canterbury earthquakes.</p>
<p>&quot;Councils should have to consider natural hazard risks such as liquefaction prior to approving new subdivisions,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
<p>National would also introduce changes to streamline the multiple planning processes of the Resource Management Act, Land Transport Management Act, and Local Government Act.</p>

<p>&quot;We want to build on the work from the Technical Advisory Groups on urban design, so we do the planning only once and then get on with the work.</p>
<p>&quot;Since we came into office, National has been working hard to balance our environmental responsibilities with our economic opportunities. If re-elected, we will continue our hard work to reduce red tape, speed up consent processing and improve compliance.&quot;</p>
