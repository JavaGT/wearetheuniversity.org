<p><strong>Wednesday, 2 November 2011, 4:53 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Steve Chadwick<br>Arts, Culture and Culture Spokesperson</p>

<p><strong>Labour supports homegrown talent</strong></p>
<p>“Labour believes there are clear cultural and economic gains to be had from a strong domestic arts industry,” says Labour’s spokesperson for Arts Culture and Heritage Steve Chadwick.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s cultural industries are recognised internationally for their excellence, contributing to our national identity, economic growth and New Zealand’s attractiveness as a premier destination for cultural tourism.</p>
<p>“Contrary to how the arts are often labelled, home-grown talent is making a strong contribution to the growth of our economy, offering exciting employment for New Zealanders and developing high-tech creative capability,” Steve Chadwick said.</p>
<p>Announcing Labour’s Arts policy in Auckland today Steve Chadwick said Labour would support and expand the creative sector with sustained investment to enable arts and cultural organisations to thrive at a regional level, a national level and in a fast-evolving digital international environment.</p>
<p>“Labour has a broad host of policies which commit to advancing the literary sector, the fine arts, galleries and museums, the film sector and New Zealand music,” Steve Chadwick said.</p>
<p>Policies announced today include continued support for skills training with a revised and modern Creative Industries Apprenticeship. Labour understands the importance of facilitating links between learning and employment. This will provide real job opportunities to support those trying to make a living in the arts.</p>

<p>“Labour will also establish a ‘Pan-Literary Group’ to discuss and agree policy and legislation that impacts on writers, an outreach delivery system of collections from Te Papa, a revised commitment to a Regional Museums and Arts Infrastructure Fund to include applications for theatre, orchestras, film platforms and performing arts infrastructure</p>
<p>“Under Labour, a major focus has been supporting our musicians to expand into overseas markets. We will continue to support the successful Outward Sound programme to assist New Zealand artists to become export-ready.</p>
<p>“The devastation of Canterbury’s quakes has thrown heritage issues into the spotlight. Labour will review the effectiveness of the Historic Places Act legislation to ensure there is a voice for community advocacy especially in extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<p>“Labour has a vision and a plan for New Zealand. Central to this plan is nurturing and facilitating home-grown talent in our cultural industries,” Steve Chadwick said.</p>
