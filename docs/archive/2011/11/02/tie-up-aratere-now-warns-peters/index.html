<p><strong>Wednesday, 2 November 2011, 11:08 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Tie Up Aratere Now Warns Peters  </p>
<p>New Zealand First has accused the Transport Minister of sleeping through the $53million shambles involving the Cook Strait ferry Aratere and says the ship should be tied up immediately.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago Rt Hon Winston Peters called for the government to explain why the alterations to Aratere have resulted in a dysfunctional shambles.</p>
<p>Since the vessel recently returned from shipyards in Singapore after being lengthened by 30 metres, it has been plagued with problems.</p>
<p>These include problems with loading shorter rail wagons resulting in:</p>
<p>· Aratere bending along the keel,</p>
<p>· Toilets not working properly,</p>
<p>· Freight capacity for trucks being reduced from 22 to 12,</p>
<p>· Aratere breaking down within a few days of arrival.</p>
<p>&quot;More problems have been reported since then.</p>
<p>&quot;The latest is that the fuel system is not working properly and that thousands of litres of fuel appears to have been &#39;lost&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important to find out whether this is an equipment malfunction or whether thousands of litres of fuel is floating around Cook Strait somewhere.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Peters says Aratere is regarded as a &quot;dog&quot; on the Wellington waterfront and the travelling public can have little confidence in it.</p>
<p>&quot;We suggest that now the minister has woken up he gets people who know what they are doing to take a good look at the ferry.</p>
<p>&quot;Aratere should be taken out of service and checked thoroughly before there is an accident,&quot; says Mr Peters.</p>
