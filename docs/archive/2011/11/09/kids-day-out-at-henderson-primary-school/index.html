<p><strong>Wednesday, 9 November 2011, 3:11 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/USU._Student_Association_at_Unitec">USU. Student Association at Unitec</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Kids’ Day Out at Henderson Primary School</strong></p>
<p>November 9, 2011</p>
<p>They’re amazingly talented, have a knack for singing and dancing, and pride themselves on making kids want to learn!</p>
<p>And on Saturday, November 19th <em>The Polkadots</em>, New Zealand’s own musical phenomenon for kids, will bring that talent to Kids’ Day Out.</p>
<p>The family fun day is hosted by USU Students’ Association at Unitec and will run from 11am-3pm.</p>
<p><em>The Polkadots</em> - New Zealand’s educational entertainers will be there performing their great song and dance routines.</p>
<p>There will also be an array of face painters, clowns, magicians, rides and bouncy castles.</p>
<p>Around a quarter of Unitec students have dependents, which is why USU Students’ Association at Unitec decided to establish the event four years ago.</p>
<p>USU Students’ Association at Unitec president, Pete Hodkinson says it’s important that the students’ association caters to all age groups of students at Unitec:</p>
<p>&quot;In particular, it&#39;s about acknowledging and supporting the fact that not all Unitec students are 18 and keen on things like parties and pub crawls. Kids’ Day Out is a whanau and community friendly day of fun and games for all ages to enjoy. As a matter of fact, it&#39;s not just for the kids, I&#39;ve been along and had a great time!&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Kids’ Day Out will be held at the Henderson Primary School fields, corner of Great North Road and Edsel Street, just a two minute walk from Unitec&#39;s Waitakere Campus.</p>
<p>Entry is free.</p>
