<p><strong>Opening the doors for increased ex-pat investment</strong><br>**<br>Press Release by ACT New Zealand Labour Spokesman Chris Simmons**<br>**<br>Wednesday, November 9 2011**</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Labour Spokesman Chris Simmons today said that the recent Kea survey of ex-pat New Zealanders who could potentially invest in New Zealand was promising.</p>
<p>“The Kea survey highlights the potential to leverage the skills, knowledge, networks and capital of New Zealanders making their living in different parts of our global village.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is a wonderful country, but currently nearly 1 million New Zealanders live and earn substantial incomes in other parts of the world. It is critical that we provide avenues for these people to participate more in the growth of our economy, and at the same time create an economy where fewer talented people leave.</p>
<p>“For more ex-pats to invest here, we need to create a healthy entrepreneurial economy that encourages new businesses growth and generates new, better, high-paying jobs. This would also help attract our best and brightest home, and create betteropportunities for young people currently in our education system, to choose to build their futures in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Potential investors surveyed in the report mention New Zealanders having a ‘sense of entitlement’ – this is a product of middle class welfare hand-outs such as Working for Families, student loans, and a welfare system in desperate need of reform.</p>

<p>“Cumbersome regulation makes matters worse; stifling aspiration and making it difficult to grow business.</p>
<p>“As a country, we need to create a culture of aspiration and success to replace this sense of entitlement.“We need to cut-back on unnecessary hand-outs, and reduce regulation. The government needs to get out of the way so people and businesses can flourish.</p>
<p>“This will make New Zealand a more attractive place for ex-pats, and indeed people from other countries, to invest in New Zealand,” Mr Simmons said.</p>
