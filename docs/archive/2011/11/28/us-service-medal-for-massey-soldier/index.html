<p>US service medal for Massey soldier</p>
<p>Massey staff member Oiroa Kaihau has been presented with a United States Meritorious Service Medal for his work in in Afghanistan with the New Zealand Defence Force in 2009.</p>
<p>Mr Kaihau was the New Zealand Army&#39;s the senior officer co-ordinating logistics for the New Zealand forces in Afghanistan,</p>
<p>United States Marine Corps General Peter Talleri presented the medal at Defence House, the force headquarters, during a recent visit to Wellington.</p>
<p>Mr Kaihau, who was a regular force lieutenant colonel and now holds the same rank in the part-time Territorial Force, said he did not think his efforts required special recognition. &quot;I was just satisfied that as a team we all did a good job and we all came home.&quot;</p>
