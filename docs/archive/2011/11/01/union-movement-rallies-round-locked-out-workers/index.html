<p>Union Movement rallies round locked out workers</p>
<p>Over 100 meat workers have now been locked for 10 days at the Canterbury Meat Packers (CMP ANZCO) meat works in Rangitikei.</p>
<p>Dave Eastlake, National Secretary of the New Zealand Meat Workers Union says &quot;workers who have been locked out are heartened by support from workers nationwide.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These workers are being told to sign an agreement that cuts their pay by 20-30% to return to work.&quot;</p>
<p>Dave Eastlake said &quot;the union challenged the lockout in the Employment Court yesterday and are waiting for a decision.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Workers recognise that a reasonable settlement has to be reached and that may include some concessions, including cuts in pay, but they cannot accept what the company has proposed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Workers have set up a picket on State Highway One, are leafleting local communities, and the union is organising financial support like grocery vouchers and other essentials.&quot;</p>
