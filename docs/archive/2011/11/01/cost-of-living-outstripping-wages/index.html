<p><strong>Tuesday, 1 November 2011, 12:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Phil<br>GOFF<br>Labour Leader<br>1 November 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Cost of living outstripping wages</strong></p>
<p>The cost of living grew at more than twice the rate of wages over the last year, Labour Leader Phil Goff says.</p>
<p>“Families are finding it hard to make ends meet and there is no sign that things are getting better,” Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>Figures released by Statistics New Zealand today revealed that wages increased by 2 per cent in the last year, while the Consumer Price Index increased 4.6 per cent.</p>
<p>“As a country we have to do better than this. We cannot continue to allow families to struggle to pay for basics like food.</p>
<p>“Labour understands that we can and should do better,” Phil Goff said. “John Key simply doesn’t understand. He tries to perpetuate the myth that Kiwis are doing well thanks to his tax switch, but the only New Zealanders who are better off are in the top 10 per cent of earners.</p>
<p>“Most Kiwis are really struggling, and they can anticipate their plight getting worse under National.</p>
<p>“Labour understands that we can and should do better. That is why we will remove the GST from fresh fruit and vegetables and make the first $5000 of people’s incomes tax free.</p>
<p>“For many families that will mean an extra thousand dollars a year to help with the rising cost of living,” Phil Goff said.  </p>
