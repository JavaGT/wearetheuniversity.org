<p><strong>Tuesday, 1 November 2011, 5:24 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Job Creators Back ACT Policy</strong></p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Leader Dr Don Brash said today that the results of the Deloitte-BusinessNZ Election Survey, polling the views of business leaders, show that New Zealand entrepreneurs overwhelmingly back policies that only ACT has the vision to implement.</p>
<p>“Businesses want a clear plan to get the economy back on track. The results of the survey clearly show that ACT, more than any other political Party, has policies that businesses – which are the real job creators – want to see,” Dr Brash said.</p>
<p>“The economy cannot grow without business. Businesses create and attract investment, they develop technology, and most importantly, they create jobs and raise income. Where politicians merely talk about boosting the economy, businesses actually do.</p>
<p>“The results of the survey speak volumes. 64 percent of business leaders want New Zealand’s tax structure to be flattened, 80 percent want a plan to raise the retirement age, and 65 percent think the youth minimum wage should be reintroduced. ACT is the only Party that has consistently campaigned on all three of these issues.</p>
<p>“Add to the list the need for a Regulatory Standards Act, private sector competition in ACC, reform of interest-free student loans and Working for Families, and numerous other policies that ACT has championed and it becomes clear that ACT is the only Party listening to what job creators are saying.</p>
<p>“During tough economic times it is vital that politicians get out of the way and encourage businesses to do what they do best – create wealth and grow the economy. ACT will do just that,” Dr Brash said.</p>
