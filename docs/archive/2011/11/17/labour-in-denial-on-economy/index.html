<p><strong>Thursday, 17 November 2011, 1:13 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour in denial on economy</p>
<p>National Party Campaign Chair Steven Joyce says Labour is once again demonstrating it has no clue when it comes to responsible economic management.</p>
<p>&quot;With Labour&#39;s latest set of half-truths and denials of economic reality, they are now stepping up on a daily basis to confirm they have learnt nothing in Opposition and are completely unready to govern,” says Mr Joyce.</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s ‘Daily Show’ of re-heated smears on National&#39;s economic management only proves three things:</p>
<p>1. They continue to deny the existence of the Global Financial Crisis, the Canterbury Earthquakes, and the early recession Labour authored before they left office.<br>2.<br>3. They continue to reveal that they believe that there should have been no spending control by the government in the wake of economic events (especially when Mr Robertson is in charge of writing the press releases).<br>4.<br>5. They want to &quot;Stop&quot; every responsible change the government has made, and revert to big spending, big borrowing, and big cost government.</p>
<p>Mr Joyce says as the campaign has gone on, Labour has dived further and further into economic and political denial.</p>
<p>&quot;This crowd&#39;s only solution to debt is to spend more and borrow more. Labour wants to take on the approach of the highly indebted European nations just when the world is heading the other way.</p>
<p>&quot;On top of that, their only solution for jobs is to lump more costs on business. No wonder nearly everyone now thinks they are completely disconnected from economic and political reality.</p>
<p>&quot;Under Labour we all would truly owe our future,&quot; says Mr Joyce.</p>
