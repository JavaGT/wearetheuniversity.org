<p><strong>Thursday, 17 November 2011, 2:24 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt. Hon Winston Peters</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leader NZ First</strong></p>
<p><strong>Address:</strong> Public Meeting</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> November 17 2011</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> 2pm</p>
<p><strong>Venue:</strong> Invercargill Workmen’s Club</p>
<p><strong>Extracts from a Speech</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘Exporting and New Zealand’s Future’</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘What National is not telling You’</strong></p>
<p>• Southland the great export province</p>
<p>• 3% of the population, 16% plus of the exports</p>
<p>• How National respects you</p>
<p>• How ‘Federated Farmers’ has deserted you</p>
<p>• What Southland could do about it</p>
<p>• The petulant walkout happened ironically at the Federated Farmers meeting in the ‘Farming Capital’ of NZ - Wellington</p>
<p><strong>The Smiley’s People</strong></p>
<p>When Key and Banks sat down for a cup of tea last Friday the smugness was oozing out of them.</p>
<p>O what a lark! The peasantry, in the form of the media scrum, were firmly in their place – on the outside looking in. The media were reduced to fawning onlookers with their noses pressed against the window - gazing in on awe as the great ones met.</p>
<p>Who did Key and Banks think they were?</p>
<p>Napoleon and Tsar Alexander meeting at Tilsit!</p>
<p>If you sat down in a café or restaurant and there was a black pouch on the table what would you do?</p>
<p>Of course you would take it to the counter</p>
<p>That is what decent people do</p>
<p>But Key and Banks did not do that simple act for one reason</p>

<p>They were enchanted.</p>
<p>They were enchanted with each other – and the bit of political theatre they had contrived.</p>
<p>Contrived with a capital C!</p>
<p>Now the New Zealand public can now see what a pair Key and Banks really are</p>
<p>Self-important – Manipulative – Insulting and dismissive of a large number of New Zealanders</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks had a word for what was present when Key and Banks met –hubris - what we would call arrogance.</p>
<p>And hubris, as the Greeks understood, is a fatal flaw that leads to disaster and ruin.</p>
<p>The real significance of the ‘cuppa-gate’ fiasco is that it shines a long overdue light on John Key’s judgement</p>
<p>• On character</p>
<p>• On trust</p>
<p>• On credibility</p>
<p>• On how he sorts out political problems</p>
<p>• On what a John Key political deal looks like for Don Brash</p>
<p>The conversation covers what Banks thinks of Brash and how Key confirms that view.</p>
<p>The conversation also covered restructuring and rebuilding of the Act Party and John Key telling Banks who the new Act Leader should be and, Winston Peter’s ‘constituents are dying’ is a description Key uses of hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders who happen to be older.</p>
<p>And equally alarming is his belief the percentage of the vote that National will get on Election Day will enable him to govern alone.</p>
<p>John Key has been found wanting</p>
<p>And the New Zealand electorate has been warned in time to take the action at the ballot box.</p>
