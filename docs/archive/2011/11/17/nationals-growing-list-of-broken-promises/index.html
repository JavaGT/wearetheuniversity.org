<p><strong>Thursday, 17 November 2011, 9:44 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National&#39;s growing list of broken promises</p>
<p>Asset sales, the ever-widening wage gap with Australia, and the Kiwi exodus across the Tasman, feature on a list of National&#39;s Top 10 Broken Promises, being released by Labour today.</p>
<p>&quot;John Key has made promise after promise to the people of this country. Three years ago he was promising a brighter future, and he is still promising that,&quot; Campaign spokesperson Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>&quot;Promising the world is easy. But if you do that you have to deliver on the promise at some stage. John Key has failed to do that.</p>
<p>&quot;We know times have been tough and there have been the double tragedies at Pike River and in Christchurch. But, just as with his conversations with John Banks, he is not being straight with New Zealanders about what has happened to the promises he has made to them&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;One of his first promises, in 2007, was that &#39;a fundamental purpose&#39; of a National Government was narrowing the wage gap with Australia by growing local wages. The wage gap with Australia has increased by an average $32 a week.</p>
<p>&quot;The same year, he stood in Westpac Stadium in Wellington and told Kiwis that every year the same number of people the stadium held - 35,000 - left New Zealand to live in Australia. As Prime Minister he would give people a purpose to stay.</p>
<p>&quot;Since John Key became Prime Minister 100,000 people have left for Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;His record regarding asset sales is no better. Here he is in October 2008: &#39;I am not interested in selling assets - I&#39;m all about building assets&#39;.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we all know what&#39;s happened to that promise. The money from the sales has already been banked by National and work is already underway inside Treasury to get the sale process going.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems there are a lot of issues that John Key and National do not want to talk about at the moment. Included among those are his promises on the issues that are affecting all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;While New Zealanders are waiting for that, Labour has a plan to secure New Zealand&#39;s long-term future, keep our assets and ease the financial pressure on struggling low and middle-income families,&quot; Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p><strong>To Follow: John Key&#39;s 10 Broken Promises:</strong></p>
<p>John Key’s 10 Broken Promises</p>
<p>1. GST<br>The promise: “National is not going to be raising GST. National wants to cut taxes, not raise taxes … what I am saying is if we do a half-decent job as a government at growing our economy I am confident that won&#39;t be happening”. (Source: Stuff, 10 February 2010) <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3311679/Key-no-GST-rise-video-emerges">http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3311679/Key-no-GST-rise-video-emerges</a></p>
<p>The reality: GST was increased to 15 per cent.</p>
<p>2. Wage Gap with Australia<br>The promise: “That would be a fundamental purpose of our Government, to narrow the wage gap between ourselves and Australia, and to grow local wages in New Zealand.” (Nexus, Waikato University, Issue 13, 3 Jul 2007)</p>
<p>The reality: The wage gap with Australia has increased by $32 a week.</p>
<p>3. New Zealanders leaving for Australia<br>The promise: We&#39;re here today at Westpac Stadium. It holds nearly 35,000 people. And believe it or not, the equivalent of this entire stadium - and more - leaves every year to permanently live in Australia … I&#39;m convinced we can give them a reason, and a purpose, to stay in New Zealand. And that&#39;s why I want to be New Zealand&#39;s next Prime Minister.

<p>10.
