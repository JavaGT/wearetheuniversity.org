<p>Katene praises Nelson City Council in recognising significance of Iwi Participation</p>
<p>Te Tai Tonga MP Rahui Katene has praised the foresight and the responsible approach to the Treaty relationship demonstrated by Nelson City Council in its decision to create a Maori ward in time for the next local body election in 2013.</p>
<p>“To be honest, it made me really proud as a Nelson girl, that the Council is taking steps to honour the Treaty relationship and to improve Maori participation and engagement in local decision-making”.</p>
<p>“Their move to establish a Maori ward within Nelson city – and the plans of Environment Waikato to introduce Maori constituencies for the Waikato region for the 2013 election – stand out as two institutions in local government who are prepared to embark on structural change to enable greater power-sharing with Maori”.</p>
<p>“These are welcome signs that some local authorities are demonstrating leadership in seeking to find better ways to engage with mana whenua”.</p>
<p>“The Maori Party has a policy commitment to establish mana whenua statutory boards at local government, based on the successful establishment of the Maori Statutory Board for the Auckland City Council, a statutory board the Maori Party fought long and hard to get”</p>
<p>“But today, my congratulations go to Nelson for placing their confidence, trust and faith in sharing decision-making and influence with mana whenua, making Nelson City Council the first unitary Council in Aotearoa to have a Maori ward”.</p>
<p>“The challenge is out there now for every other Council to publicly notify its intention to create a Maori ward for their constituency in time for 2013”.</p>
<p>Background note</p>
<p>* The Bay of Plenty Regional Council has four Maori seats; and the Waikato Regional Council has voted to establish two.</p>
