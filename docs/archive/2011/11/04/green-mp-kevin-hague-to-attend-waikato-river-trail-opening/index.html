<p>Green MP Kevin Hague to attend opening of Waikato River Trails</p>
<p>What: Green MP Kevin Hague will attend the grand opening of the Waikato River Trails Cycle Trail.</p>
<p>When: Saturday, November 5, 2011, 11:00AM (rain or shine)</p>
<p>Where: Whakamaru Reserve, Ongaroto Road, SH30, just south of the Whakamaru dam.</p>
<p>Green Party MP Kevin Hague will attend the grand opening of the Waikato River Trails, one of eighteen Great Rides making up Ngā Haerenga, the New Zealand Cycle Trail.</p>
<p>“The Green Party is excited to be working co-operatively with the Government to help deliver a great local asset for the Waikato region,” Mr Hague said.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Cycle Trail is a joint initiative between the Green Party and the Government.</p>
<p>“I spent a lot of time growing up in Hamilton at a time when the community had largely turned its back on the Waikato river,” said Mr Hague.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to return and see how much things have changed. This river trail will provide an awesome opportunity for people to explore and celebrate one of New Zealand’s most impressive rivers.</p>
<p>“The long-term vision for the Cycle Trail project is for a network of cycling routes and tracks throughout the country that can be used by tourists and recreational riders, but eventually also by people riding to work or the supermarket, and kids riding to school.</p>
<p>“Special credit belongs to the Waikato River Trails Trust who began construction of the trail long before the concept of the Cycle Trail was born. Thanks to their foresight, the local community will enjoy many economic, social, and environmental benefits from the cycle trail.”</p>
<p>Members of the public are being invited to join the celebration by participating in one of three community events, an 8km walk, a 14km walk or a 14km cycle ride. On the day registrations for the event starts at 10:00AM.</p>
