<p><strong>Friday, 4 November 2011, 4:44 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Dr Jonathan Coleman<br>National Party Spokesman for Immigration</p>
<p>4 November 2011</p>
<p><strong>Immigration policy supports economic growth</strong></p>
<p>Growing the economy and attracting the skilled migrants and investment capital New Zealand needs is the main focus of the National Party’s immigration policy, says Immigration Spokesman Jonathan Coleman.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s policy announcement builds on the immigration initiatives of the past three years which have been geared towards boosting economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Our immigration policy will continue to attract migrants with the skills and capital to help grow the economy,&quot; Dr Coleman says.</p>
<p>&quot;We are competing worldwide to recruit skilled and talented people and our aim is to ensure immigration policy is maximising the economic benefits for New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;Attracting more investment into New Zealand through the business migration scheme is a key priority under National. The Government revamped the scheme in 2009 and to date it&#39;s attracted over $700 million in potential investment capital. We will continue to attract more business migrants who have the commercial nous and global networks to help Kiwi businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;We have maintained New Zealand Residence Programme numbers and we also remain committed to accepting 750 refugees a year through the United Nations refugee programme.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Coleman says immigration will continue its focus on supporting export education. Changes to student visas have strengthened the multi-billion dollar sector by allowing more people to study short-term courses.</p>
<p>Complementing the changes to policy over the past three years has been the turnaround in the performance of Immigration New Zealand (INZ).</p>
<p>&quot;Three years ago INZ was in deep strife. Its processes needed an overhaul and performance had to improve. Now we have a department that has lifted its game to facilitate the entry of the skilled workers, foreign students, investors and tourists that our country needs,&quot; says Dr Coleman.</p>
