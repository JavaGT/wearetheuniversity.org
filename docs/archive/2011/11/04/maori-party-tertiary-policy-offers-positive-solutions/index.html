<p>Maori Party tertiary policy offers positive solutions for students</p>
<p>The release of the Maori Party’s tertiary policy in its manifesto demonstrates a commitment to the value and importance of education to both the country and our citizens, and will be welcomed by those in favour of improved student support and direct methods to address mounting student debt.</p>
<p>“The commitment to introduce a universal student allowance is particularly welcome, as students are the only group in society expected to borrow to meet basic living costs, and this borrowing is a key driver of the $12 billion of student loan debt now held by New Zealanders,” said NZUSA Co-President David Do.</p>
<p>Other policies include reinstating the Training Incentive Allowance to support sole parents through education and into work, and fee reduction measures to ease the cost of higher education and reduce the student debt burden.</p>
<p>“The Maori Party also share NZUSA’s concern that underfunding and lack of investment in tertiary education is hampering opportunities and resulting in unfair outcomes, and that this needs to change,” says Do.</p>
<p>“This policy also prioritises the role of the student voice, complementing the Maori Party’s opposition to ACT’s extreme student membership legislation passed recently,” says NZUSA Co-President Max Hardy.</p>
<p>“Along with all opposition parties, the Maori Party signed a pledge at Parliament on the day the Bill passed committing to replacing this destructive law with an enduring and balanced piece of legislation that offers genuine choice and quality services to students ,” added Hardy.</p>
<p>“Students and graduates will be hoping that the Maori Party prioritises these progressive tertiary policies in any future potential coalition arrangements,” concludes Do.</p>
