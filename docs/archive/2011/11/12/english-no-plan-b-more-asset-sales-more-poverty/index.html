<p>12 November 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>English: No plan B, more asset sales, more poverty</strong></p>
<p>“Bill English today gave New Zealanders three good reasons to vote Labour on 26 November, says Labour’s Finance spokesperson David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“Speaking on TV3’s ‘The Nation’ this morning, Mr English said National had no plan for the economy in the event of a major market meltdown, again refused to rule out further assets sales beyond 2014; and admitted no progress had been made on reducing poverty.</p>
<p>“Faced with growing risks of a European meltdown, and more warnings in the Reserve Bank’s Financial Stability Report out this week, Bill English’s admission this morning that the Government is not working on a “Plan B” in case of a major downturn is extraordinary,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“This is irresponsibility personified and emphasises the danger of John Key and Bill English’s short-sighted thinking. New Zealanders deserve a government that is willing to make the hard decisions now so that Kiwis are provided for in the future.</p>
<p>“It comes as no surprise that there is no “Plan B” when the National Government cannot even come up with a credible Plan A,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“Bill English also refused to rule out further asset sales. New Zealanders know that means National and the ticket clippers in the financial markets are already looking to make the next buck off Kiwis hard-earned assets.</p>

<p>“Three out of four Kiwis oppose asset sales. They don’t want Transpower, KiwiBank and KiwiRail added to the list,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“Lastly, faced with increasing evidence of a growing underclass and acute poverty in New Zealand, Mr English was forced to admit National had made no progress – arguing poverty was ‘about the same’ as in 2008.</p>
<p>“Poverty is actually now much worse, thanks to the rising cost of living and National’s increase in GST – except for the wealthy few who have enjoyed billions in extra tax cuts,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“Labour wants to raise the bar for all New Zealanders, not just a select few.</p>
<p>“National has no plan, it won’t rule out more asset sales, and its inaction is condemning hundreds of thousands of Kiwis to a dim, insecure future – three good reasons to vote Labour on 26 November, David Cunliffe said.  </p>
