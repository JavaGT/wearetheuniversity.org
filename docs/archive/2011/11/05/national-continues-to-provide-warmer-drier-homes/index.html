<p><strong>Saturday, 5 November 2011, 12:02 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon John Key</strong><br><strong>Prime Minister &amp;<br>Leader of the National Party</strong>  </p>
<p>5 November 2011 <strong>Media Statement</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>National continues to provide warmer, drier homes</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister and National Party Leader John Key today announced the National Party housing policy, which includes a commitment to complete the insulation of every State house built before 1978 by the end of 2013.</p>
<p>&quot;This will ensure thousands of New Zealand families have a brighter future through living in warmer, drier, and healthier homes,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
<p>&quot;By the end of 2013, National will ensure the remaining 4600 State homes built before 1978, when insulation became standard for State houses, are insulated where it is practically possible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Funding for this will be allocated from Housing New Zealand&#39;s baseline so National is also fulfilling its promise to do better with the money we have,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
<p>Since National came into Government in 2008, more than 133,000 privately-owned homes have also been retrofitted with insulation under its $347 million Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart insulation and clean heating scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;National is committed to retrofitting at least another 50,000 homes,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
<p>Under the scheme, homeowners with houses built before 2000 are eligible for 33 per cent of the cost of installing ceiling and under floor insulation, up to a maximum of $1300.</p>
<p>&quot;This scheme has ensured about 2000 Kiwis are in full time employment.&quot;</p>
