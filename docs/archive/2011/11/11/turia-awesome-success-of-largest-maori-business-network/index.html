<p><strong>The Hon Tariana Turia</strong><br><strong>Maori Party Co-Leader | MP for Te Tai Hauauru</strong><br><strong>11 November 2011</strong></p>
<p>Maori Party Co-leader, Tariana Turia, has drawn attention to the “awesome success” of New Zealand’s largest Maori business network, the Federation of Maori Authorities, as it sets out on its national conference in Tauranga this weekend.</p>
<p>“I’m really frustrated that an over-crowded schedule means I can’t be there myself, but our list candidate Tina Porou will be there for the whole weekend, and party whip, Te Ururoa Flavell, will be attending the opening banquet tonight” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“The thing that strikes me from their programme is how well positioned Maori are to achieve success on the global stage” said Mrs Turia. “The sooner that Governments recognize the depth and strength of the Maori economy – the better. Māori have a $36.9 billion dollar asset base – and FOMA members, representing around 150 Maori authorities – have much to contribute to our economic wealth, through their leadership and investment expertise”.</p>
<p>“I am particularly excited that Canadian Aboriginal activist and academic, Calvin Helin, will be addressing their hui on the possibilities of First Nation Trade Agreements”.</p>

<p>&quot;I read his book, <em>Dances with Dependency</em>, a couple of years ago and was really excited by his leading edge thinking which promotes the concept of moving out of poverty through self-reliance, collective responsibility, respect and cultural strength,</p>
<p>“These are exactly the types of concepts which the Maori Party has drawn on in establishing our policy on Maori economic development - and indeed in advancing Whanau Ora”.</p>
<p>“Whanau, hapu and iwi are tired of being patronised by those who profess they can help the poor but who really seek to increase economic dependency on the state.</p>
<p>I congratulate FOMA for their vision, in promoting a long-term, intergenerational outlook which will lift outcomes across our communities; and I wish them all a great conference”.</p>
<p><strong>Maori Party Policy on Economic Development</strong></p>
<p>We will produce a Māori Economic Strategy to address the drivers that underpin investment in iwi/Māori. We will grow iwi/Māori participation in the economy by looking at:<br>• Growth models (Genuine Progress Index).<br>• Iwi Infrastructure/ Māori Economic Consortiums.<br>• Māori Investment Capital Funds/ Māori Bank.<br>• Māori Trademark and Intellectual property protection.<br>• Māori/Iwi Economic Sector Infrastructure.<br>• Māori representation on NZ Trade and Enterprise.</p>
