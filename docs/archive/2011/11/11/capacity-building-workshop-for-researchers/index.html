<p>Participants of the ODN Proposal Writing Workshop at the USP Laucala Campus in Suva.</p>
<p>A two-day workshop on writing proposals was hosted by the Oceania Development Network (ODN) at the University of the South Pacific’s Laucala Campus from 8 - 9 November, 2011.</p>
<p>Held at the Faculty of Business and Economics (FBE), the capacity building workshop attracted researchers from around the region to present and discuss on how to prepare research proposals.</p>
<p>As one of the regional networks of the Global Development Network, the ODN contributes to an effective Pacific Island Research Community through the promotion, generation, sharing and<br>application of multidisciplinary knowledge for the purpose of development by investing in research by Pacific Islanders.</p>
<p>The ODN has established itself as one of the key networks within the GDN - which has become a worldwide network of research and policy institutes working to provide new perspectives to the development challenges of the present times.</p>
<p>In his introductory remarks, the Dean of FBE, Professor Biman Chand Prasad who also serves as the ODN Chairperson, highlighted that the ODN’s main focus was to help develop the research capacity of young researchers in the region.</p>
<p>He explained that the workshop was a means to mentor young researchers to develop not only good research outputs but also to engage in policy relevant research and try to find ways to work with policy makers in the region.</p>
<p>According to Professor Prasad, ODN has come a long way since its inception. He stated that the expansion of ODN plays an important role in the region.</p>

<p>“We have had a series of research competitions, production of policy papers and I am very pleased that we were able to expand the network beyond the four or five universities we initially had,” he remarked.</p>
<p>He acknowledged the assistance provided by academics from USP and other universities in facilitating the workshop.</p>
<p>The workshop also provided the participants with the opportunity to interact with the people of USP and the winners of the Regional Research Competition.</p>
<p>Speaking at the workshop, the Chief Guest and Coordinator of International Relations from the University of French Polynesia, Dr Leopold Mu Si Yan said that such workshops were vital to support young research scholars in the region and to listen and discuss their research papers.</p>
<p>As a member of one of the five research teams at the University of French Polynesia, Dr Yan told participants that every four years, the research teams at the University have to produce relevant and interesting research.</p>
<p>“This is necessary to get accreditation and funding and it is one of the reasons the University of French Polynesia encourages young scholars to participate in various research programmes of the University which are result oriented,” Dr Yan explained.</p>
<p>Professor Prasad informed participants that the next GDN annual conference will be held in Budapest, Hungary, in June 2012, after which ODN will host its own pioneer conference in September 2012, in Fiji.<br>8<br>ENDS  </p>
