<p><strong>Double win for Massey at science awards</strong></p>
<p>Massey University professors have won two of the four medals presented at last night’s New Zealand Association of Scientists Awards in Wellington.</p>
<p>Professor Harjinder Singh, co-director of the Riddet Institute, was awarded the New Zealand Association of Scientists Shorland Medal, while Professor Geoff Jameson won the Marsden Medal.</p>
<p>Professor Singh, who holds a Fonterra Chair in Dairy Science at Massey University, is a world authority on milk proteins and their relationship to dairy technology and processing. His work has been characterised by innovation as well as the ability to translate laboratory-based findings to the food industry. The Shorland Medal is awarded in recognition of major and continued contribution to basic or applied research that has added significantly to scientific understanding or resulted in significant benefits to society.</p>
<p>Professor Jameson is director of the Centre for Structural Biology, and is one of the leading crystallographers in the world. Under his leadership, the centre has thrived with new x-ray equipment and high-field NMR spectrometers being added to the suite of techniques available in-house. The Marsden Medal is awarded for a lifetime of outstanding service to the cause or profession of science, in recognition of service rendered to the cause or profession of science in the widest connotation of the phrase.</p>
<p>Massey University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says the two medals are a fantastic achievement for the University. “These awards are open to scientists at all New Zealand’s universities and crown research institutes, so for Massey to win two of the four awards is a great reflection on the relevant and recognised science being carried out here.”</p>
