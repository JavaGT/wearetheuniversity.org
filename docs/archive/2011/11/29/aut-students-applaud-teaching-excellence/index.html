<p><strong>AUT students applaud teaching excellence</strong></p>
<p>Today students at AUT University recognised teaching staff in this year’s AuSM (Auckland Student Movement at AUT) Awesome Awards ceremony.</p>
<p>Hundreds of students at AUT acknowledged the value and passion of teaching staff that have contributed to their learning and education by nominating the best lecturers in AUT’s five faculties.</p>
<p>The AuSM awards provide an opportunity for students to positively reinforce the large number of dedicated staff who go out of their way to provide great service.</p>
<p>“Teaching is more of an art than a science. Great teachers have the ability to create some magic; the ability to get students to discover that they have more ability than they realised. That’s what we value at AUT and that is what these awards, made by students themselves, recognise”, says AUT Vice-Chancellor Derek McCormack.</p>
<p>Sue Raleigh received the award for best lecturer for the Health &amp; Environmental Sciences Faculty and she also won the overall award based on student nominations. Sue is a senior lecturer in Human Anatomy and Physiology, in the School of Interprofessional Health Studies.</p>
<p>“I want to say thanks to AuSM, I never expected to get nominated and then to win. It just blows my mind”, she says.</p>
<p>Raleigh has a long history of winning this award having received it four times over the last five years. In 2009, she was also awarded a Vice-Chancellor’s Excellence in Teaching Award.</p>
<p>The winners of the AuSM awards are lecturers and non-academic staff who have been recognised for their contribution during 2011.</p>
