<p><strong>Friday, 18 November 2011, 10:58 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Workers laid off six weeks before Christmas</p>
<p>Workers at the Auckland Pacific Branch of Immigration New Zealand have received an unwelcome gift from the National Government-- they&#39;re been laid off just six weeks from Christmas, says Labour&#39;s spokesperson for Pacific Island Affairs Su&#39;a William Sio.</p>
<p>&quot;The bad news for 14 families came in a wordy, bureaucratic letter from the Department of Labour,&quot; Su&#39;a William Sio said (letter attached).</p>
<p>&quot;The Auckland branch of Immigration New Zealand provides a vital service to the Pacific community and unfortunately is not the first agency to fall victim to National&#39;s cuts to front line services.</p>
<p>&quot;People working in the public sector have good reason to be concerned as National continues to undermine their work.</p>
<p>&quot;Auckland is the Pasifika capital of the world. These people offered a frontline service supporting thousands of families to settle in New Zealand but that service is now in jeopardy.</p>
<p>&quot;In the year ended September 2011 there were 18,930 permanent and long-term arrivals to New Zealand from Oceania (Australia, Fiji, Samoa and Tonga). At a time when applications for residency are already reaching a bottleneck, and the number of Pacific people living with illegal or irregular immigration status is growing, the latest cuts don&#39;t make sense.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is committed to strengthening Pacific families&#39; wellbeing by helping them settle in to their communities on arrival. Cutting support for a central advisory hub, with this explicit purpose is a step in the wrong direction and will make it more difficult for affected families.</p>

<p>&quot;The median Pasifika income is down by $106 a week since National took office, making it even harder for those establishing or supporting families to make ends meet,&quot; Su&#39;a William Sio said.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has a plan for job creation, and for economic growth which will work with Pacific families not against them. We won&#39;t leave people high and dry at Christmas with no explanation and no plan.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand has a strong and proud history in the Pacific. We must value and support the contributions of migrants and their families. National is simply cutting valuable core services off at the knees,&quot; Su&#39;a William Sio said.</p>
