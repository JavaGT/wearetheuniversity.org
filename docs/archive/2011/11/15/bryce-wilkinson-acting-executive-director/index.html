<p><strong>Tuesday, 15 November 2011, 3:54 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Business_Roundtable">New Zealand Business Roundtable</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Bryce Wilkinson Acting Executive Director</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand Business Roundtable chairman Roger Partridge announced today that economist Dr Bryce Wilkinson has been appointed acting executive director of the Business Roundtable.</p>
<p>Dr Wilkinson is director of economic consultancy Capital Economics Limited, and has been author of a number of Business Roundtable studies and an advisor on and contributor to many of its projects. His appointment follows the death last month of executive director Roger Kerr.</p>
<p>Mr Partridge said the organisation was fortunate to be able to call on Dr Wilkinson’s services at this time.</p>
<p>“Bryce has been a close and longstanding colleague of Roger’s and is well known to and respected by our members.</p>
<p>“He has a strong background in public policy analysis, capital market research and microeconomic advisory work, and in recent years has worked on a wide range of public policy issues”, Mr Partridge said.</p>
<p>Dr Wilkinson’s work includes regulatory reform, the principles behind user charges, competition policy, property rights, securities regulation, tertiary education reform and reform of the water industry, roads, and accident compensation.</p>
<p>Prior to setting up Capital Economics in 1997, Dr Wilkinson was a director of Credit Suisse First Boston in New Zealand (now First NZ Capital). Before moving into investment banking in 1985, he worked in the New Zealand Treasury, reaching the position of director.</p>
<p>He was a member of the government&#39;s Regulatory Responsibility Taskforce, the 2025 Taskforce and the ACC Stocktake Group.</p>

<p>Dr Wilkinson has a PhD in economics from the University of Canterbury. In 1977-78 he was a Harkness Fellow at Harvard University. He is a fellow of the Law and Economics Association of New Zealand.</p>
