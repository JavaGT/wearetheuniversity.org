<p>Victoria University has announced its two latest Hunter Fellows, who will be recognised in a ceremony in Victoria’s iconic Hunter Building this month.</p>

<p>“Hunter Fellows are people who have made a substantial contribution to advancing Victoria University’s strategic directions and interests,” says Professor Walsh.</p>
<p>The Hunter Fellowships will be presented at a ceremony in the Hunter Council Chamber at Victoria on 21 November.</p>
