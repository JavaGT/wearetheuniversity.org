<p>Polls Predict Three Epsom MP’s</p>
<p>The focus on the critical Epsom electorate continues and Green Party candidate David Hay’s chance of entering Parliament is on the rise. The Epsom candidates from the three major parties, National, Labour and the Green Party, could all be in parliament after the election according to poll results over the last week. The Green Party is polling in the vicinity of 12-13% which is enough to see as many as 16 Green MP’s.</p>
<p>At number 16 on the Green Party list, Epsom candidate David Hay would enter Parliament alongside his Labour and National rivals. National candidate Paul Goldsmith and Labour’s David Parker have been assured of their places in Parliament throughout the race due to their high rankings on their respective Party lists. Whether Epsom returns its fourth candidate seems less likely with the ACT Party polling between one and two percent while National’s Paul Goldsmith increases his lead over John Banks in electorate polling.</p>
<p>Mr Hay, an economist and policy analyst, says the success of the Green Party in this election can be attributed to the Greens’ campaign focus on developing a smart green economy that works for everyone. “We have been listening to what New Zealanders want and that is reflected in the campaign.” Mr Hay said “The central and local campaign teams have worked hard to make that connection. There is a huge wellspring of support out there.” Mr Hay says that the Green Party’s vision is for a richer New Zealand, where children are properly provided for and the economy and environment are managed in smart and sustainable ways. “We have the people and policies needed to achieve that.” he said. “The skill and experience of the candidates on the Green Part list is extraordinary.”</p>

<p>The previous or current occupations of the top twenty on the Green Party List include two lawyers, four academics and a diplomat. Four of the top ranked Greens are or have been business strategists or CEO’s, three work in environmental consultancy roles and a further four have worked in or been elected to local government. The group is split evenly between male and female, while four identify, at least in part, as Maori. At a Party vote of around 11%, the Green Party caucus will include New Zealand’s first deaf MP, Mojo Mathers, who is number 14 on the Party list.</p>
