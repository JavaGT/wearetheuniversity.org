<p>24 November 2011<br><strong>Green Party campaign wraps up</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party wrapped up its campaign today in Auckland with a free concert and reminder to get out and vote for jobs, rivers, and kids on Saturday.</p>
<p>“A vote for the Greens is a vote for a richer New Zealand in the things that really matter. A richer New Zealand will have clean rivers, healthy kids, and jobs that are good for our environment and our economy,” Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said.</p>
<p>“The Greens are ready to get back into Parliament with more MPs and more energy than ever before to start working on our priority areas of jobs, rivers, and kids.</p>
<p>“We’ve got costed plans to bring 100,000 children out of poverty by 2014, clean up our rivers, and to create thousands of new green jobs.</p>
<p>“By making Working for Families work, providing better study support for sole parents and beneficiaries, raising the minimum wage to $15, and making sure rental properties are warm and healthy we can reduce inequality and make sure our kids get the best start in life possible,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
<p>Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman said creating new green jobs was vital to New Zealand’s economy.</p>
<p>“We need to keep state assets in Kiwi hands,” Dr Norman said, “and use them to transform our economy.</p>
<p>“We will create green jobs by ensuring our state-owned energy companies capture the massive export opportunities in renewable energy. We’ll also shift the drivers in the private sector towards sustainability and increased productivity.</p>

<p>Dr Norman said the Greens would clean up the New Zealand’s rivers and lakes to make sure we can swim in them again.</p>
<p>“Over half of our monitored rivers are unsafe for swimming, one third of our lakes are unhealthy, and two-thirds of our native freshwater fish are at risk or threatened with extinction,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“The Green Party will set standards for clean water, introduce a fair charge for irrigation water, and support water clean-up initiatives.</p>
<p>“Jobs, rivers, and kids: It’s a pretty compelling vision for a richer New Zealand,” Dr Norman said.</p>
<p>“It’s really important that people enrol to vote by tomorrow so, come Saturday, they can vote for good green change.”<br><strong>ENDS</strong></p>
