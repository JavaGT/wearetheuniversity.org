<p>24 November 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Industry trainee numbers fall 31 per cent</strong></p>
<p>Industry trainee numbers have fallen by 41,000 --- or 31 per cent --- since National came to office, Labour’s Employment and Youth Affairs spokesperson Jacinda Ardern said today.</p>
<p>“That demonstrates in compelling fashion the lack of commitment National has to skills training,” Jacinda Ardern said.</p>
<p>“In the past year alone, the number of industry trainees has fallen by 16,000.”</p>
<p>Jacinda Ardern was commenting on a response by Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce to an OIA from Labour about industry trainee numbers.</p>
<p>“He’s delayed his response for a week longer than he should have, but that’s probably understandable given there’s an election this week, and the figures are embarrassing for National.</p>
<p>“There’s one slight note of cheer --- building and construction trainees have started to rebound slightly --- but in Christchurch the numbers are still 43 per cent lower than when National came to office.</p>
<p>“This is despite the Canterbury Skills Board saying we need 30,000 extra skilled trades people for the rebuild,” Jacinda Ardern said.</p>
<p>“Labour knows that employers are facing tough financial times and training is an additional cost some don’t want to bear, but New Zealand needs to act now to avoid a looming skills shortage.</p>
<p>“That’s why Labour will convert the dole into a subsidy for employers who take on apprentices,” Jacinda Ardern said “This will create 9000 new places for a start.</p>

<p>“We will also create 1000 new group and shared apprenticeship places so employers don’t have to deal with all the responsibility of taking on an apprentice.</p>
<p>“National has no plan for skills training. Instead of boosting trades training and helping employers take on more apprentices, they cut $145 million from industry training in Budget 2011. That’s no vision for a smarter more productive New Zealand. No wonder Mr Joyce has delayed releasing the figures.”</p>
