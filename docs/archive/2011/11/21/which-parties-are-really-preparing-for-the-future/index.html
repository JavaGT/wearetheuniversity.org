<p>Which Parties are Really Preparing for the Future?</p>
<p>Hon Tariana Turia, Co-leader of the Maori Party</p>
<p>Monday 21 November 2011</p>
<p>The Maori Party is advising New Zealanders to think about future forecasts when they go to the ballot this Saturday.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s got to be more meaningful than a focus on capital gains tax; $1000 Christmas presents; gold cards and asset sales. We want to focus on the quality of life - and that&#39;s exactly what we anticipate with Whanau Ora&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Our key message for Election 2011 is ˜Our Whanau our Future’ – and as our campaign advertisements, our billboards, and our opening address demonstrate, whanau takes in the full range from our babies to our grandparents”.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing more important than the wellbeing of our children to the strength of our whanau.</p>
<p>While the Maori Party – along with Labour and Greens has made child poverty a key issue – we must also have plans in place to invest in the greatest wellbeing of our mokopuna.</p>
<p>&quot;It’s so easy to identify all the things going wrong – the Maori Party wants to also encourage us all to keep our aspirations high; nothing less will do”.</p>
<p>&quot;The Maori Party gives priority to universal well-child services for all children under six; cultural competency in schools; computers in homes; post-school options to ensure children who have been mainstreamed can continue to succeed; and a values and virtues approach to education, expecting excellence and achievement for all students”.</p>
<p>&quot;As we lead off into this last week of the campaign we hope that the wealth of our nation will be considered as being the future of our tamariki. Our children will be an increasingly diverse group of New Zealanders whose needs must be met. How do we demonstrate respect for the cultural integrity of all of our children; our leaders of tomorrow?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All of the statistics tell us that the Asian, Pasifika and Maori ethnic groups are growing faster and will increase their share of the New Zealand population. We must prepare a foundation for their future”.</p>
<p>Billboards: ˜Our whanau are our future’</p>
