<p>Voters urged to consider the bigger picture</p>
<p>With just five days to go until the General Election, New Zealanders are being urged to carefully consider the taxation policies of each party.</p>
<p>Professor Chris Ohms and Dr Karin Olesen from AUT University suggest voters really need to be thinking about the big picture when looking at tax policy.</p>
<p>“Tax is simply a way to fund Government expenditure. It does not create booming economies.”</p>
<p>According to the academics, the New Zealand economy will only grow when the right economic, trade and foreign policies are in place.</p>
<p>“The economy relies on adequate supplies of the ‘factors of production’ - land, labour and capital – in order to grow and function, in addition to the right number of consumers, and suppliers of goods and services.</p>
<p>“You need to get this right first. Only then can you put in place a tax system that is broad-based; that uses a low rate without any differences between tax entities such as companies and trusts; and that is fair and simple.”</p>
<p>Ohms and Olesen argue the tax system should follow the comprehensive income model, and include a tax on realised capital gains, excluding private use assets such as the family home.</p>
