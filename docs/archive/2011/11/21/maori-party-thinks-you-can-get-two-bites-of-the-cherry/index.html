<p>Nanaia Mahuta<br>Hauraki-Waikato MP</p>
<p>21 November 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT<br>Maori Party thinks you can get two bites of the cherry</p>
<p>The Maori Party are scrambling their message on asset sales, says Hauraki-Waikato MP Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
<p>&quot;On the one hand they are saying ‘no’, on the other hand they are saying &#39;yes&#39; if iwi want it! They need to make their minds up what they stand for,&quot; said Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
<p>&quot;Selling the country&#39;s SOEs when there is no guarantee that our major assets will remain in kiwi ownership is hugely unpopular amongst Maori and pakeha,&quot; said Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
<p>&quot;At this election every Maori voter will get a chance to say what they want. If they want to keep Our state assets then party vote Labour!&quot; said Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
<p>&quot;Many Maori know that iwi don&#39;t have the capacity individually or as a collective to purchase a major shareholding of all the assets proposed for sale. In addition to that not one iwi has sought a mandate from their tribal members to commit their tribes resources for such a significant investment,&quot; said Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
<p>&quot;The Maori party are saying its ok to sell the family house and rent it back to the kids - it doesn&#39;t make any sense and they need to stop doing the dirty work for National.</p>
<p>“Just be straight up - once assets are sold that&#39;s it, you don&#39;t get two bites at the cherry,&quot; said Nanaia Mahuta</p>
