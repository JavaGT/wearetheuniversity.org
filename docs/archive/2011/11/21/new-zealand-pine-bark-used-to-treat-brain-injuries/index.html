<p>AUT University<br>Media Release: 21 November 2011<br><strong>New Zealand pine bark used to treat brain injuries</strong></p>
<p>Researchers at AUT University are investigating the use of supplements made from New Zealand pine tree bark extract to treat traumatic brain injury (TBI).</p>
<p>Ongoing cognitive difficulties are common following TBI and can profoundly affect a person’s day-to-day functioning and ability to work and live independently, says Professor Valery Feigin. Director of AUT’s National Institute for Stroke and Applied Neuroscience, Feigin is leading a team of researchers looking at the effect of Enzogenol (<em>Pinus Radiata</em> bark extract) on the cognitive functions of a group of patients with mild TBI.</p>
<p>Sixty people with persistent cognitive difficulties due to TBI took part in the pilot study where they were given Enzogenol for either a six or 12 week period. Results of the pilot study have been announced at New Zealand’s first national conference on stroke and applied neuroscience.</p>
<p>“Every day, 90 New Zealanders sustain a brain injury, ranging from mild to severe. Acquired brain injury - including stroke and traumatic brain injury - is the leading cause of disability and death in this country costing our health system an estimated $100 million per year,&quot; says Feigin.</p>
<p>“Many supplements claim health benefits, however this research is one of very few evidence-based treatments. Until now, there has been a lack of effective medication for mild TBI. Other than brain exercises, there are limited treatments available to improve damage as a result of TBI.”</p>

<p>The aim of the pilot study was to explore the effectiveness of Enzogenol to improve verbal and working memory, information processing speed, attention span, everyday memory difficulties and post-concussive symptoms in patients three to 12 months following mild TBI. The major causes of TBI are motor vehicle crashes, sports injuries, assaults and falls, says Feigin.</p>
<p>Senior Research Fellow Dr Alice Theadom says that preliminary results have indicated an improvement in day-to-day cognitive functioning.</p>
<p>“There was a statistically significant improvement on the reporting of cognitive failures such as walking into a room and forgetting what you went in for, failure to remember names, forgetting directions on a familiar route and forgetting to respond to important correspondence.</p>
<p>“The pilot trial has revealed some promising findings for use of the Enzogenol supplement to improve everyday cognitive failures. We’ll now be looking at conducting a full scale clinical trial to determine the effectiveness.”</p>
<p>Enzogenol is a natural extract from the bark of New Zealand grown pine trees produced by ENZO Nutraceuticals using a specialised water-only extraction method. The active compounds in Enzogenol are flavonoids and other plant polyphenols with antioxidant and natural anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>So far, other clinical research findings have shown that Enzogenol may help improve brain activities and cognitive performance, says Feigin. “We are also investigating the actual incidence of TBI in New Zealand; it’s a far greater problem than we anticipated.”</p>
