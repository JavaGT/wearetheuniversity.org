<p><strong>Green Party’s Water Policy Reckless And Dangerous Says Don Nicolson</strong></p>
<p>ACT Party Primary Industries spokesman Don Nicolson today described the Green Party’s water policies as “reckless and dangerous” following a radio interview with Kevin Hague, in which the Green MP said water storage and irrigation was bad because it intensified land use – a prospect Mr Nicolson said will alarm gardeners.</p>
<p>“I don’t like being negative, but this is sheer lunacy from the Green Party,” Mr Nicolson said.</p>
<p>“During my term as President of Federated Farmers, we invited Russel Norman to Canterbury’s Opuha Dam and he went away saying reasonably positive things about water storage for farming and the environment. Then we hear Kevin Hague contradicting his leader on the radio by slagging off water storage because it will ‘intensify’ land use.</p>
<p>“Using Mr Hague’s loopy logic, it would mean no more water dams for the cities.<br>“According to the Greens, all water dams will do is to ‘intensify’ cities so it’s time for them to come clean. You won’t need better public transport because, as Federated Farmers pointed out the other day, water storage makes city life possible. No water storage: no cities.</p>
<p>“It must mean the Greens want a hose pipe ban every day of the year.</p>
<p>“That will shock gardeners who know that if you don’t water your veggie patch in summer, it dies. Scale that up to farms and you are talking about an economic meltdown.</p>
<p>“Green polices need critical scrutiny environmentally and economically. Water storage makes for more exports, and these exports help pay for all sorts of public services including hospital operations. What public services would Mr Hague cut to deliver his green nirvana?</p>
<p>“The Greens are dangerous, inconsistent and reckless. It’s high time to expose them for what they are: hard core socialists in a green cloak.</p>
<p>“We know the dirtiest rivers and streams are all in the cities, but the Greens wouldn’t admit that because that’s where their supporters live, and no one likes to look in the mirror. It seems much easier for them to abuse farmers with their mouthful, and that reveals their true colours.</p>
<p>“There’s something in the water alright and it’s not green,” Mr Nicolson said.<br><strong><a href="http://www.act.org.nz/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=4152&qid=1066569">Click here</a></strong> for an audio link to Mr Hague’s radio interview.<br>ENDS</p>
