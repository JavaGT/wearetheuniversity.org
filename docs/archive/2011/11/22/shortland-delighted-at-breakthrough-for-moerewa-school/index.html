<p><strong>Shortland delighted at breakthrough for Moerewa School</strong><br><strong>22 November 2011</strong><br><strong>Waihoroi Shortland, Candidate for Te Tai Tokerau</strong></p>
<p>Maori Party candidate for Te Tai Tokerau, Waihoroi Shortland, is delighted at the break-through that has been achieved for Moerewa School as a result of his advocacy.</p>
<p>&quot;The Maori Party is deeply committed to creating a climate of excellence in all our kura. We have set our goals on Maori success in education as being the benchmark of an effective educational system.</p>
<p>”It was therefore a great shock to learn that the viability of a school - Moerewa - which is experiencing pass rates in NCEA levels one, two and three that are higher than rates across the country - was being threatened by decisions to close their senior satellite class.</p>
<p>”The Maori Party saw this as an issue of grave significance not just for Te Tai Tokerau but nationwide. It is our absolute belief that positive educational outcomes for Maori must be a matter of national priority”.</p>
<p>”What is of even more concern is that this action follows the last decade of change for Moerewa schools in which previous Governments and the local MP have neglected to take the action that was required”.</p>
<p>”Moerewa became the school that received students from Matawaia and Orāuta School when Trevor Mallard closed those schools during his term of office.</p>
<p>“The words that keep resonating in the ears of the community from that time was that the challenge to use the &#39;opportunity&#39; of the school closures for Moerewa and the surrounding district to be better served.</p>

<p>”The thinking was that opportunities for our mokopuna would improve with amalgamation and resources and costs could bring better delivery.</p>
<p>&quot;The recent announcements by Minister Tolley fell in the face of this history.</p>
<p>&quot;As of this morning, my co-leader Dr Sharples has raised these issues with the Minister of Education and has gained her assurance that there will be a meeting of all concerned parties after the election. I appreciate her prompt action, and I am just so pleased that the Minister is willing to consider a local solution to this situation”.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot act too soon when the fate of Maori education is in our hands.</p>
<p>“Maori educational success is of the utmost importance to our future, and as such, the Maori Party is proud to take up whatever challenge comes our way to make sure the community aspirations and our highest educational ambitions are realised.</p>
<p>“We must use the leverage that we have in Government wisely and ensure those who are succeeding are supported to continue to deliver the best schooling our tamariki could ever hope for”.</p>
