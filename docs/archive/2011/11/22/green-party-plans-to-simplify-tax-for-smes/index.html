<p><strong>Green Party plans to simplify tax for SMEs</strong></p>
<p>Simplified tax compliance for small businesses is one of a number of measures the Green Party has promised small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) today.</p>
<p>“Reducing the costs of tax compliance for small businesses is one of a number of SME-friendly measures we plan to introduce,” said Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman.</p>
<p>“Small businesses with small annual turnovers spend a lot of time and money on tax compliance. We plan to give these small businesses the option of paying their taxes on a simplified cash basis on their GST returns.</p>
<p>“For even smaller businesses, company tax can be based on turnover.</p>
<p>“The proposals are broadly in line with those proposed by the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and could reduce tax compliance costs by up to a third.”</p>
<p>Simplifying tax compliance is one of a number of Green Party policies designed specifically to support SMEs.</p>
<p>“The performance of the SME sector is a critical component of a green economy,” Dr Norman said.</p>
<p>“To strengthen the domestic market for green innovation, the Green Party will rewrite government procurement and certification processes to favour New Zealand made environmentally sustainable goods and services.</p>
<p>“By greening government procurement policies, local SMEs will face incentives to rapidly innovate to secure lucrative government contracts. Once secured, those SMEs will have a base from which to export their same clean technology solutions overseas.</p>
<p>“We’ll supplement our green government procurement policies with a $100 million start-up capital fund for clean technology SMEs and community enterprises, and boost central government funding of R&amp;D by $1 billion over the next three years.</p>
<p>“Our plans are fully costed and will create thousands of new green jobs as we transition to a more resilient and sustainable economy.”</p>
