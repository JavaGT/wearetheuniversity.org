<p>National Party abandons low income schools</p>
<p>National&#39;s plans to divert funding to schools that are already &#39;high performing&#39; shows its agenda has nothing to do with lifting under-achievement, says Labour&#39;s education spokesperson, Sue Moroney.</p>
<p>&quot;Not content with giving tax cuts that favour high income earners, they now want to use taxpayer money to embellish already well resourced schools. &quot;We need to be making sure every child in New Zealand has the same access to high quality education no matter where they live or what their parent&#39;s income is. But National is simply planning to reward a few schools while abandoning those that need extra help.</p>
<p>&quot;It is easier to achieve good academic results in communities where family resources are plentiful than it is in communities where resources are scarce.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s proposal will further increase the growing gap between the rich and the poor in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;If funding is linked to the flawed national standards data, then schools will actually be incentivised to embellish their data, rather than report accurate information to parents on their child&#39;s achievement.</p>
<p>&quot;The interests of children should be at the heart of any education policy. National clearly believes its political views are more important than educating children,&quot; Sue Moroney said.</p>
