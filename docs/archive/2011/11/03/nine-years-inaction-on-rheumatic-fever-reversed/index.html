<p>Nine years inaction on Rheumatic fever reversed</p>
<p>&quot;Labour should be ashamed of its nine years of inaction on Rheumatic fever - a serious third world disease that affected more and more Kiwi children under Labour,&quot; says National Party health spokesman Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;In 2001, Labour in government boasted that reducing the impact of Rheumatic fever was a priority. Basically, nothing happened, other than more kids got Rheumatic fever.</p>
<p>&quot;Rates for this serious and largely preventable third world disease have actually increased in the past ten years.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the John Key-led government has committed an extra $12 million over four years to combat Rheumatic fever in vulnerable communities. This will benefit around 22,000 children who might otherwise have been left undiagnosed and untreated,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;The first of the National Government&#39;s throat swabbing programmes for signs of Strep A throat in school children are up and running successfully in Kaitaia, Northland and Flaxmere, Hawkes Bay. This builds on recent District Health Board programmes in the Bay of Plenty.</p>
<p>&quot;Since throat swabbing started, no Flaxmere school children have developed Rheumatic fever while one child was diagnosed with Rheumatic fever from previously undiagnosed Streptococcal A sore throat during week one of the Northland programme.</p>
<p>And throat swabbing programmes with antibiotic follow up in South Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Lakes, Tairawhiti and Porirua are on track to start checking children for Strep A throat from Term One next year.</p>

<p>&quot;Rheumatic fever is a serious third world disease that is costing the country up to $40 million per year in health care according to estimates by the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>&quot;And this doesn&#39;t count the untold suffering of patients and families. It can lead to years of monthly penicillin injections and cardiac surgery,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;The John Key-led government is committed to improving health care for all New Zealanders particularly for those most at risk.</p>
<p>The Rheumatic fever initiative is one of several preventive health programmes introduced by the National government.</p>
