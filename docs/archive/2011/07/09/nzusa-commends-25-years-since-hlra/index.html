<p><strong>NZUSA commends 25 years since HLRA</strong></p>
<p>Students are joining others in the community Saturday(July 9) who are marking and commending 25 years since the passage of the Homosexual Law Reform Act in 1986.</p>
<p>“Education has always been the primary focus for NZUSA. However, ‘homosexual’ law reform was also a key area of concern amongst students in the 1980s and an area of much needed social reform,” says NZUSA co-President David Do</p>
<p>NZUSA’s key objectives then included: working to represent the views of students on matters of concern to students, or of concern to students as members of society in general; and also functioning as a major, informed and principled pressure group with education, student welfare, and social reform (nationally and internationally) among its areas of concern.</p>
<p>“Tertiary students helped contribute to the energy and effort in pushing for passage of the Homosexual Law Reform Act in 1986. NZUSA is proud to have been part of a progressive social<br>movement towards a fairer country for everyone, including students,” says Do.</p>
<p>Since then, NZUSA continues to be committed to queer students and advocates for barrier-free education. Examples of NZUSA’s continuing work include:<br>• supporting the first national UniQ conference in 1997[1]<br>• supporting UniQ today through their annual national conferences and with a NZUSA National Queer Rights Officer position (NZUSA is also supporting this year’s UniQ conference being held at Waikato University this weekend)<br>• supporting the Civil Union Bill and the Relationships (Statutory References) Bill in 2004<br>• having policy that supports official representation of GLBTI students within students associations’ governance and management structure<br>• opposing discrimination and violence on campus<br>• having policy that opposes heterosexism as a form of discrimination<br>“Congratulations to everyone who fought for progress in this country and for a fairer better society today,” concludes Do.</p>

While every group is independent from each other, UniQs all share similar goals, take part in national campaigns and meet once a year for the national UniQ conference.</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.</p>
