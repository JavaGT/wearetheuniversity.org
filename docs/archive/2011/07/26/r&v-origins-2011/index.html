<p>The Otago University Students Association, in association with Rhythm and Vines and the 100% Pure New Zealand Winter Games are pleased to announce…</p>
<p><strong>R&amp;V Origins 2011</strong><br>Feat. The Black Seeds, P Money, I am Giant and Knives at Noon<br>at the Dunedin Town Hall, Friday 19 August 2011. 8:00pm – Midnight</p>
<p>Rhythm and Vines returns to its birthplace Dunedin with an all-star line-up going back to its roots. <strong>R&amp;V Origins</strong> features the festival’s first-ever headliners The Black Seeds, together with crowd favourites P Money, I Am Giant and Knives at Noon, and the same intimate, chilled-out atmosphere that’s always been associated with the festival.</p>
<p><strong>The Origins of R&amp;V</strong><br>In the depths of the Dunedin winter of 2003, friends Hamish Pinkham and Tom Gibson asked a group of friends to join them one Sunday afternoon at iconic student bar, Gardies. The purpose - to discuss holding a New Years Eve party for their friends in Gisborne that they named Rhythm and Vines.</p>
<p>At the time they couldn’t have known they were creating what would one day become one of New Zealand’s most iconic music events. But such were the humble beginnings of Rhythm and Vines. And while the festival has grown into an internationally renowned and award winning event, its origins have always been close to its heart.</p>
<p>With this in mind Rhythm and Vines returns to the southern city to present <strong>R&amp;V Origins</strong> on Friday 19 August 2011**.**</p>
