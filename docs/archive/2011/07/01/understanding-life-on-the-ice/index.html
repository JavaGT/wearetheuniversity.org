<p>Understanding life on the ice</p>
<p>The value and relevance of Antarctic science to New Zealand is the focus of a conference being held at Waikato University starting Monday. The 2011 annual Antarctic Conference is for students and scientists involved in Antarctic-related research and one of the organisers from the University of Waikato, microbial ecologist Professor Craig Cary, says some conference discussion will focus on taking research knowledge beyond academia to a broader public and policy makers.</p>
<p>“Most people think that Antarctica is completely covered in ice when actually 0.3% is permanently ice free,” says Prof Cary. “That might not seem like very much, but almost all life on the continent is found in these ice-free areas and understanding these pristine environments may help us in our understanding different ecosystems that have been impacted by humans.”</p>
<p>The University of Waikato has led New Zealand in terrestrial biological research for 25 years and its research will be highlighted at this week’s conference, along with other scientists looking at coastal and marine systems, and climate.</p>
<p>In a less scientific vein, recent Antarctic Arts Fellow singer Dave Dobbyn will talk about his experiences on the ice.</p>
<p>Last year Waikato University received $50,000 from Antarctica New Zealand in seed funding for the new International Centre for Terrestrial Antarctic Research (ICTAR) to establish the Antarctic Graduate Student Research Endowment Fund. Professor Cary is director of ICTAR and says hosting the conference is timely for the University as it will signal the start of a fundraising campaign to build on that seed money.</p>

<p>ICTAR is an international partnership between Waikato University, Gateway Antarctica at the University of Canterbury and representatives from nine foreign countries all with dedicated terrestrial Antarctic research programmes. The endowment is to support continued growth and development of Antarctic research expertise in New Zealand. Waikato University has also contributed a $50,000 match.</p>
<p>“The fund will support scholarships for Antarctic research and will help us encourage and develop the next generation of well-qualified and enthusiastic Antarctic researchers from New Zealand,” says Professor Cary. “It strengthens our ties with the region and the Antarctica New Zealand organisation.”</p>
