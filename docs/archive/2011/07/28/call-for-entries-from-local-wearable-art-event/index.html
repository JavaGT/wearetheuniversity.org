<h3>Call for Entries From Local Wearable Art Event</h3>
<p>ReStyle’s annual wearable arts fashion show makes a call for entries as the closing date for the competition draws near on August 10.</p>
<p>ReStyle encourages the community to create unique high fashion and artistic pieces to walk the runway that are made solely from recycled goods and waste materials. As a not-for-profit charitable trust, ReStyle relies on its valued sponsors to run the annual event in Hamilton, such as The Body Shop.</p>
<p>“This years show is going to be unlike any other ReStyle event,” says Event Co-Manager Laura McClennan. “We have introduced a new stage set up and theme to the show, and have come up with a collection of what we hope to be inspiring categories for ReStyle contestants to enter, such as Goin Gaga, Mad Hatter and our signature Avant Garabge,” says Miss McClennan.</p>
<p>ReStyle is entering its 11th year, and with a new organizing committee, the show hopes to compete with the likes of WOW, New Zealand’s most well known wearable arts competition, and also build a more high-fashion and artistic image.</p>
<p>Kylie Barugh, ReStyle Co-Manager, would like to see Hamilton’s young designers step up to the challenge and enter the competition.</p>
<p>“We get a lot of entries from school students, which is fantastic, but it would really help ReStyle to grow if we could secure a higher number of design students or those with a real passion or experience in fashion design. Some of our past winners have gone on to be very successful in the fashion industry, meaning ReStyle provides a great opportunity to build designers skills and confidence, as well as simply being a really fun and exciting experience to be part of” says Miss Barugh.</p>
<p>ReStyle 2011 is set to grace the stage at the Founders Theatre on September 10. Entry forms are available from The Body Shop or from <a href="http://www.restylehamilton.co.nz">www.restylehamilton.co.nz</a></p>
