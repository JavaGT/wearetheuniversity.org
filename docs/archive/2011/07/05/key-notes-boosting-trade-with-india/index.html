<p><strong>BOOSTING TRADE WITH INDIA</strong></p>
<p>On Friday I got back from a five-day visit to India.</p>
<p>In New Delhi I met Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh to <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16234.link">build stronger ties between our two countries</a>.</p>
<p>Two-way trade between our countries is already worth more than $1 billion a year and we want to boost that further. Finalising a Free Trade Agreement with India was always going to be a complex process. But being on the ground has made me more confident than ever that we&#39;re making good progress towards the conclusion of the deal, scheduled for early next year.</p>
<p>I also visited Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium, to play a bit of cricket with Stephen Fleming and announce some <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16235.link">new sports scholarships</a>. And I enjoyed a quick visit to the impressive Taj Mahal with my wife Bronagh.</p>
<p>In Mumbai I went to Film City where the Bollywood movie <em>Players</em> is being filmed. It&#39;s one of many Bollywood films which have been partly produced in New Zealand. Prime Minister Singh and I signed <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16236.link">an agreement that makes film co-production easier</a>. As Tourism Minister I appreciate the immense value of having New Zealand scenery on show in films with such a huge audience.</p>

<p>I also got the chance to pay my respects to victims of the 2008 Mumbai Terrorist Attacks at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.</p>

<p><strong>UNCLOGGING THE GROWTH ARTERIES</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday I <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16238.link">launched the second National Infrastructure Plan</a> with Bill English and Steven Joyce.</p>
<p>Since we came into government, we&#39;ve been working hard to improve this country&#39;s productive infrastructure because we know it&#39;s a driver of economic growth.</p>
<p>The plan shows the Government will spend more than $17 billion over four years on assets such as schools, hospitals, state houses, prisons, roads, broadband, and rail. This will help support jobs and build the foundations for economic growth.</p>

<p><strong>BETTER BROADBAND</strong></p>
<p>Last week the <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16240.link">roll out of fast broadband to our rural communities got underway</a>. On Thursday the first three rural schools connected to ultra-fast fibre - Henderson Valley School in West Auckland, Te Kura o Omaio in the Bay of Plenty, and Granity School on the South Island&#39;s West Coast.</p>
<p>Broadband is a key part of National&#39;s plan to build a stronger economy, lift wages, and provide the world-class health and education services families need.</p>
<p>Our $300 million Rural Broadband Initiative will bring fast broadband to rural schools, businesses, and households. This is complemented by our <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16241.link">$1.5 billion urban ultra-fast broadband initiative</a>, which will deliver broadband speeds of 100 Megabits per second to 75 per cent of Kiwis where they live, work, and study by 2019.</p>
<p><strong>FROM MY DIARY</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday I announced the <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16242.link">re-appointment of my Chief Science Adviser Sir Peter Gluckman</a> for another two years.</p>
<p>Tonight I&#39;m attending <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16243.link">a state dinner for His Majesty King Tupou V of Tonga</a>. On Thursday I&#39;ll be in Hamilton for the day, and in the evening I&#39;ll be speaking at a public meeting hosted by the <em>Waikato Times</em>.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p><strong>John Key<br>Prime Minister</strong></p>
