<p>Jacinda<br>ARDERN<br>Labour List MP based in Auckland Central<br>Moana<br>MACKEY<br>Housing Spokesperson</p>
<p>5 July 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Labour MPs to take part in Big Sleep Out</strong></p>
<p>Labour List MP based in Auckland Central, Jacinda Ardern, and Labour’s Housing spokesperson Moana Mackey are not letting cold and rain prevent them from participating in the Lifewise Big Sleepout to raise awareness for the issue of homelessness in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Jacinda and Moana will be swapping their electric blankets and hot water bottles for sleeping bags and cardboard, as part of The Lifewise Big Sleepout this Thursday 7 July, on Auckland University of Technology’s city campus.</p>
<p>“This is a fantastic initiative to increase public awareness of homelessness and the wider social issues associated with it,”Jacinda Ardern said.</p>
<p>“Financial hardship, unemployment and the rising costs of housing are central factors which contribute to homelessness in New Zealand. The Big Sleepout is a symbolic way to raise awareness and generate discussion on possible solutions,” Moana Mackey said.</p>
<p>“We are campaigning hard to raise $1,000 in sponsorship as a way to help Lifewise in their mission. Taking part in the event last year emphasised the fantastic job Lifewise does in the Auckland community. The sponsorship money will go a long way to provide sustainable solutions for the homeless of Auckland,” Jacinda Ardern said.</p>
<p>Lifewise is an Auckland-based community organisation. They work to find new ways to solve challenging social issues and provide services to families in need, the homeless, and older and disabled people. The Big Sleepout encourages business and community leaders to experience sleeping rough for a night as part of its mission to completely eradicate homelessness.</p>
<p>“With a cool 12°C and a few showers expected in Auckland on Thursday night we are planning to rug up warm to survive the night exposed to the elements,” Moana Mackey said.</p>
<p>“I’m hoping the event, and the cold, will encourage more people to work to make sure no New Zealander has to spend their winter sleeping rough,” Jacinda Ardern said.</p>
