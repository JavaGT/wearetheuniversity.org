<p>Big scholarship boost for current UC students</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury has increased its scholarship funding for 2012 and beyond by more than a third. As part of that boost in funding it has established a new scholarship specifically for students who have completed at least a year at UC.</p>
<p>The new UC International Mobility Outbound Exchange Scholarship will provide $5,000 in cash for up to 50 UC students who are nominated to study on exchange at one of UC’s partner institutions.</p>
<p>“This scholarship will help current UC students to gain experience studying overseas as part of their UC degree and enable them to have an experience akin to that enjoyed by students this semester at the University of Adelaide and the University of Oxford,” said University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor, Dr Rod Carr.</p>
<p>UC’s exchange partner institutions include: the National University of Singapore, Purdue University, Tsinghua University, the University of British Columbia, the University of California, the University of Cambridge, the University of Copenhagen, the University of Oxford, the University of Tokyo, the University of Washington, and the University of Adelaide.</p>
<p>In addition to the new exchange scholarship, UC has also significantly boosted the number of Masters and PhD scholarships on offer in 2012. There are ten additional PhD scholarships and five additional Masters scholarships on offer next year – an overall increase in postgraduate scholarships of more than 10 per cent.</p>
<p>“We believe in supporting sustained achievement at UC,” said Dr Carr. “Postgraduate students are an important part of our research community and we want to encourage high achievers at postgraduate level.”</p>
