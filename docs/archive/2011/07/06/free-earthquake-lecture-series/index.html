<h3><strong>Free earthquake lecture series</strong></h3>
<p>The University of Canterbury is to hold a series of free public lectures which will consider the geological, engineering and psychological aspects of the recent earthquakes.</p>
<p>Last year, more than 1500 people attended lectures by geologist Dr Mark Quigley who has become well known through his numerous media appearances. In the first lecture of the upcoming series Dr Quigley will be joined by Professor Jarg Pettinga, who has himself been in the media recently for his seismic survey work.</p>
<p>The series will run between 27 July and 31 August. The lectures will be held on Wednesday evenings between 7pm and 8:30pm in the University’s central lecture theatre block.</p>
<p>The series will cover liquefaction, rock fall and slope stability, structures and buildings, earthquake performance of houses and timber buildings, and the psychological impact of earthquakes.</p>
<p>Because seating will be limited pre-registration is required. Visit <a href="http://www.communityed.canterbury.ac.nz">www.communityed.canterbury.ac.nz</a> or phone 0800 VARSITY (827 748)</p>
