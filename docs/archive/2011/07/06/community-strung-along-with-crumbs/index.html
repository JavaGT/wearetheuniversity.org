<h3>Community strung along with crumbs</h3>
<p>Labour’s Voluntary and Community Sector spokesperson and Hauraki-Waikato MP Nanaia Mahuta says the community and voluntary sector is starting to really feel the pressure of a constrained funding environment.</p>
<p>&quot;National has announced another tranche of funding for the Community Response Fund and it is clear that it doesn’t really have a plan to support the sector and is happy to trickle out small amounts of funding each year,&quot; Nanaia Mahuta said.</p>
<p>&quot;Cost of living pressures are really starting to impact on families, on services reaching out to rural communities, and on services that have had their funding pulled back.</p>
<p>“The Community Response Fund puts the sector into a short-term funding cycle that only acts as a &#39;gap-filler&#39;,&quot; Nanaia Mahuta said.</p>
<p>&quot;This coalition government has lacked the vision to work constructively with the sector to plan for increased funding pressures and demand for services.</p>
<p>“Instead it has opted for a &#39;take from Peter to pay Paul’ approach, and whanau ora initiatives clearly fall short of the mark,&quot; Nanaia Mahuta said.</p>
<p>&quot;Too many good services in the community are missing out because the Government lacks vision and a plan to work with the sector. Now that it’s election time the coalition is rolling out piecemeal funding, but that’s simply not good enough.</p>
<p>&quot;Those providers who have been able to secure CRF or whanau funding are grateful for what they get, but the sector as a whole is suffering because of Minister Paula Bennett’s short sighted approach,” Nanaia Mahuta said.</p>
<p>‘It&#39;s time for Paula Bennett to be accountable to the community and voluntary sector, and to work with the sector to better respond to the community’s real needs.”</p>
