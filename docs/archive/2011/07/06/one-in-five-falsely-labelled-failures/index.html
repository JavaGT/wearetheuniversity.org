<p><strong>Sue MORONEY<br>Education Spokesperson<br>6 July 2011</strong></p>
<h3>One in five falsely labelled ‘failures’</h3>
<p>“That is the harsh reality of a top-down system which is unwanted, unsupported and ultimately likely to damage our children’s education.</p>
<p>“School boards of trustees continue to refuse to submit the charters necessary to implement the National Standards, which were due to the Ministry by Friday. A spokesman for the Minister confirmed that about 140 charters were handed in by protesting schools and other charters had yet to be handed in at all.</p>
<p>“This shows that the Government’s National Standards are not being implemented nationally, nor are they standard in their implementation. The flip flop would be laughable if the consequences for our children weren’t so severe.</p>
<p>“The action being taken by school boards of trustees shows growing disapproval of parents towards National Standards. This follows on from public statements made last week by the South Canterbury Principal’s Association that parents were finding the new school reports were confusing and gave them less information than ever before.</p>
<p>“This one-sized-fits-all approach will see too many children fall through the gaps. We need tried and tested measures, not ideology, to ensure that our children get the best education possible.</p>
<p>“The Minister’s answers to questions in the house today fail again to reassure parents and schools that National Standards are in any way robust, and unfortunately it is our children who will suffer,” Sue Moroney said.</p>
