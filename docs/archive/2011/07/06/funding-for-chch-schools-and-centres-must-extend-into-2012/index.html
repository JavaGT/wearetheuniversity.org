<h3>Full funding for Christchurch schools and centres must extend into next year</h3>
<p>It is essential that Christchurch schools and early childhood centres have full funding extended into 2012 while the situation remains so unpredictable, according to the education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa.</p>
<p>The Education Minister is ruling out keeping funding at pre-earthquake levels, which will result in the loss of hundreds of teacher and support staff jobs, and affect student learning.</p>
<p>NZEI says there is still a lot of uncertainty and rolls for next year will be very difficult to predict. It has been involved in regular discussions with the government and the Education Ministry, and has repeatedly called for current funding levels to stay in place for the 2012 year.</p>
<p>“The government needs to take a long-term view. Families and communities in Christchurch are still in such a state of flux. Retaining pre-quake funding would give everybody some sort of certainty for what is going to be a long and hard road ahead. Reducing funding will only serve to make the road more difficult,” says NZEI President Ian Leckie.</p>
<p>“Principals, teachers and support staff are working tirelessly to provide stable learning environments for their students. They are also fulfilling an important social role in many traumatised and damaged communities. Staffing levels need to be maintained if schools are to meet increased student needs and the extraordinary and long-term demands the earthquakes have placed on them.”</p>
<p>For early childhood centres the situation is even more urgent. While the government has guaranteed full pre-quake funding for schools until the end of this year, it has still not given the same commitment to early childhood services.</p>
<p>Ian Leckie says this is having a major impact particularly on those smaller, community-based centres which are struggling to keep their doors open.</p>
<p>NZEI will continue to work closely with principals, teachers and support staff in Christchurch and lobby the government to ensure their concerns are listened to. “In the end it’s all about keeping the teaching and learning of Christchurch children on track,” says Mr Leckie.</p>
