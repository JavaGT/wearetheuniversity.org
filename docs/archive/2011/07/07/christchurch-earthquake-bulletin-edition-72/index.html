<p>Christchurch<br>LABOUR MPs  </p>
<p>7 July 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Christchurch Earthquake bulletin edition 72</strong><br>The Labour Party’s Christchurch electorate MPs, Earthquake Recovery spokesperson <strong>Clayton Cosgrove (Waimakariri), Ruth Dyson (Port Hills), Lianne Dalziel (Christchurch East) and Brendon Burns (Christchurch Central)</strong> have started a regular bulletin to keep people in their electorates and media informed about what is happening at grass roots level.</p>
<p><strong>CLAYTON COSGROVE:</strong> The Government’s cross-party briefing for MPs --- the first held in a long time --- was a strange affair last night. The Government had <strong>NOTHING</strong> to actually brief us on. We had a number of issues to raise with the Government, however, including the fact that after several months we still haven’t had a reply from Gerry Brownlee about whether the Government will provided distressed residents with access to independent legal advice when dealing with settlement of insurance claims, contracts and the Government’s offers to purchase properties. This issue is still very much on our agenda. It is still very much on the agenda of our constituents. The <strong>only</strong> agenda it isn’t on is apparently Gerry Brownlee’s. The other issue we want action on is access for MPs to the briefings CERA officials hold for local authorities, so we can pass first-hand information on to our constituents. We wrote to Gerry Brownlee about this issue some weeks ago. There has been no response! Maybe we will get some now because at the cross-party briefing Labour MPs were supported by National list MP Nicky Wagner. Maybe her enthusiasm for the idea will make it more difficult for Gerry Brownlee to continue to ignore this important request. It was more than interesting in Parliament yesterday to see the Government floundering in trying to respond to our questions about whether Mr Brownlee stood by his statements (after the September quake, again in March this year after 22 February, and as late as June) that homeowners’ equity would be preserved. Clearly, it isn’t going to be, as more and more examples emerge of anomalies resulting from the Government’s offers last month. The Government is now falling back on a somewhat querulous response --- ‘our deal is a fair one’. That is going down increasingly like a lead balloon with many of our constituents.</p>

<p><strong>RUTH DYSON:</strong> Last weekend our door-knocking team came across an elderly couple (he is 92) who have been living in a very small sleep-out attached to their garage since February’s quake. Their home had lost all the roof tiles, but otherwise was relatively undamaged. They were unsure what action, if any, was being taken in regard to their repairs, despite several different people visiting them. I contacted the Fletcher hub who agreed this roof replacement was a priority and I hope they can move back into their home very soon. Meeting them was a sharp reminder of how people, particularly those traumatised by the quakes, can miss out completely on information and support and end up in unsatisfactory living arrangements. Work is progressing well on investigating the causes of water and flooding in Heathcote, Woolston and St Martins. Originally constituents were told by the council that if the water was on their own private property, it was their responsibility to resolve the issue, but I am pleased EQC has taken a strong leadership role and organised suburb-wide investigations so we can get solutions that will work for everyone. This much more efficient and effective approach will cost less, produce a total picture, and will be much less time-consuming and stress-inducing than the council’s approach. This evening I will join the Sydenham Business group to hear an update from Urban Design on the Sydenham recovery plan. There is such a positive buzz around the future of Sydenham. I am sure this meeting will add to that.</p>
<p><strong>LIANNE DALZIEL:</strong> Yesterday we raised questions in the House about the commitments the government has made around equity as there has been some backtracking. Unfortunately the Minister wasn’t in the House so Maurice Williamson answered on his behalf. He answered my question exactly as I thought he would: “Does he stand by his statement on 7 October last year that ‘the people of Canterbury who have suffered property damage can take heart…that the equity they believed they had in their properties prior to the 4 September event is preserved’; if so, why?” To which he replied: “He stands by the statement he made on 7 October. No one could have predicted the 22 February event. The 23 June offer to purchase in the most damaged areas at the 2007 rating value is a fair one.” I then asked if he stood by his statement of 8 March this year, after the 22 February earthquake: “But right from 4 September I have repeatedly said that what we have to do is protect the equity that people think they’ve got in their properties”, and I asked him to admit that the Government’s offer fails to achieve that for many of those who will be receiving the Government’s offer. I then tabled a summary of 17 emails I received after the Government leaked the announcement but before it was made, all identifying shortcomings – and that was before the announcement. We should be able to engage with the government on this at least to obtain some fairness. There are a variety of aspects to this, but one I want to pick up on today is the fact that as things stand homeowners still have the option of taking the Earthquake Commission cash settlement for the land if it is higher than the 2007 rating value for the land, but no-one has been told that and no-one has been told what value that produces in their particular case. We know that the market value of the minimum section size will in some cases be more than the 2007 rating value of the land. We must have this information before the offer is sent so we can all make informed decisions.</p>
<p><strong>BRENDON BURNS:</strong> With Christchurch colleagues, I asked questions in Parliament yesterday on whether equity is preserved under the Government’s dual-option offer to Red Zone residents. We asked those questions because many of our constituents heard and took assurance from comments that their equity would be preserved. Now they are coming up against the brick wall of brutal reality. Community indications in Avonside indicate many in that part of my electorate see themselves losing between $50,000 - $90,000 if they take the Government’s land and building option. The option to take the land settlement and negotiate with your insurance company can produce even bigger equity drops where houses have moderate damage that doesn’t trigger what insurers regard as Total Replacement payments. There have been on-going efforts by Government to deny that assurances on equity were given or to suggest they were made pre-February 22. Journalists have been told that this is not true. Our questions showed such assurances were being given as recently as after the June 13 event. If February changed things, people deserved to be told upfront. Instead we&#39;ve had the continuation of Government double-speak; it has continued to give assurances on equity being preserved when in fact that is blatantly not the case for many people.</p>
