<p>Labour compromise could save Radio One</p>
<p>Student-owned Dunedin radio station Radio One&#39;s popular broadcasts are on the line as the Act Party continues its battle to gut student associations and force them to cut valuable services to students, says Labour&#39;s Broadcasting spokesperson and MP for Dunedin South Clare Curran.</p>
<p>Radio One is one of many local student stations under threat if departing Act MP Heather Roy&#39;s Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill is passed.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bill, currently before Parliament, aims to destroy the ability of student unions to provide valuable advocacy and services for students. Radio One, the 27 year old University of Otago radio station, will be one of its first casualties,&quot; Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>&quot;During the select committee process Labour put forward a number of possible compromises that could have seen an enduring arrangement for student association membership. They are still on the table but so far ACT have refused to consider them.</p>
<p>&quot;Radio One is owned by tertiary student association OUSA, which has confirmed it is looking at selling the iconic station in light of the ACT-sponsored bill.</p>
<p>&quot;A Deloitte commissioned report has suggested selling Radio One because it supposedly has &#39;little commercial value&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Radio One provides a crucial community service, one that cannot be measured in dollars alone. It has been crucial in fostering the growth of Dunedin&#39;s music scene as well as giving aspiring journalists and radio producers valuable experience,&quot; Clare Curran said.</p>

<p>&quot;It is a disgrace that the Minister of Tertiary Education Steven Joyce supports this bill, considering he cut his teeth in broadcasting thanks to student radio at Massey University. If this bill is to pass then we will likely see the end of student radio in New Zealand, along with many other services provided by student associations.</p>
<p>&quot;For a city like Dunedin the loss of Radio One will have a huge impact on local artists, journalists and the community at large.</p>
<p>&quot;This bill is ideologically motivated and local content will suffer. A National-Act Government would see a lot more services lost for Otago University students and the Dunedin community as a whole,&quot;Clare Curran said.  </p>
