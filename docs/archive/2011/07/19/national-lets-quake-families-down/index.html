<p>19 July 2011<br>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>National lets quake families down</strong></p>
<p>National’s refusal to provide families of the victims of February’s earthquake with independent legal counsel for the Royal Commission’s Inquiry into the deaths of their loved ones is deplorable, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
<p>“The decision is not only morally indefensible, but inconsistent as well. The Government did the right thing by families affected by the Pike River tragedy, supplying independent legal counsel, yet is denying counsel to families of those tragically lost in the worst natural disaster this country has seen in 50 years.</p>
<p>“National’s decision really is unprecedented. State assistance in a circumstance such as this is fundamental. Reports that National ‘didn’t see any point’ in funding legal representation are difficult to fathom.</p>
<p>“Families deserve independent legal counsel which represents their interests alone. The Government has got it wrong and needs to reverse the decision,” Clayton Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“The Government has 5.5 billion dollars at its disposal to assist Canterbury, but is refusing to support families through a harrowing process.</p>
<p>“Yet It has been revealed that National has doubled the income of individuals appointed to the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) Review Panel ---an independent group set up to provide advice to Ministers’ on Orders in Council associated with the recovery effort--- to more than $1000 per day.</p>

<p>“I am not arguing against these individuals, but at a time where the Government is refusing basic legal advice for victims’ families, National’s double standard in relation to panel members is even more unacceptable.</p>
<p>“All families want to do is to honour the memories of their loved ones by ensuring every question is answered, that all information is scrutinised, and that nothing is glossed over in this inquiry.</p>
<p>“Families have the right to sleep at night knowing that they have done everything they can to honour their loved one’s life. We all understand Ministers need to seek advice and counsel—often at a high cost--- why can’t victim’s families be accorded a similar privilege?”</p>
