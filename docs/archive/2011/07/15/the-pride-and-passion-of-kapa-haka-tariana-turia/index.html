<p>The pride and passion of kapa haka - Tariana Turia</p>
<p>The Hon Tariana Turia Maori Party Co-Leader | MP for Te Tai Hauauru</p>
<p>Local Te Tai Hauauru MP, Tariana Turia, was very proud to see the level of talent and absolute pride demonstrated by the taiohi performers involved in Te Whanganui a Tara secondary school kapa haka competitions, held today at Te Rauparaha Arena in her electorate in Porirua.</p>
<p>&quot;My congratulations go to Te Kura Maori o Porirua who took out first place in the competitions today&quot; said Mrs Turia. &quot;This is a fabulous achievement for Te Kura Maori o Porirua who have just celebrated ten years since they were established - nga mihi aroha ki a koutou&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It was great to see kura coming together, to share their love of kapa haka&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;That undeniable strength that comes through the pursuit of kotahitanga, was seen in the second place getters (St Patricks, St Catherines College and Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Nga Mokopuna - Seatoun joining together) and third place (Te Rahui Kura : Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Whakatipuranga Rua Mano, Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Te Rito and Otaki College - also from Te Tai Hauauru electorate).</p>
<p>&quot;I have to say that as a Nanny I was especially proud of my mokopuna who performed, for the very first time, in Te Haeata Awatea (Wellington and Wellington Girls Colleges which were placed fourth)&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;And in my mind - that is one of the greatest achievements that kapa haka brings in our whanau - that unbelievable pride and joy in the expression of the very essence of who we are&quot;.</p>
