<p>Sunday 24 July 2011<br>Press Release: New Zealand Labour Party</p>
<p>The Labour Party has selected Jo Mclean as its candidate for the Selwyn general electorate in this year’s general election.</p>
<p>Jo will be running a positive “two-tick” campaign for the Party and Candidate vote for Labour in Selwyn.</p>
<p>“There is only one Party in this country that truly stands for all New Zealanders, and can and will delivery fair and equitable policies that will ensure that we have a strong future through long term policies”.</p>
<p>“I will be promoting Labour’s policies to take all GST off fruit and vegetables, make the first $5000 of income tax free, and stop National’s plan to sell our assets”.</p>
<p>Jo Mclean holds a degree in sociology from the University of Canterbury, and currently works as an organiser for the Engineering Printing and Manufacturing Union. As a mother of five children, one of whom who is adopted, Jo well knows the challenges facing families trying to balance the household budget. She is of Ngai Tahu decent and has many links into the Selwyn electorate.</p>
<p>“Selwyn needs a strong new voice in Parliament and New Zealand needs a Government that puts the interest of the many ahead of the interests of the few. I am going to work hard to ensure that come the general election I will be that strong new voice”, said Jo Mclean.</p>
