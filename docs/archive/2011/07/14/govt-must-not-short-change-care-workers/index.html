<p>Govt must not short change care workers</p>
<p>John Key&#39;s Government should ensure that workers in the care sector are paid what they are legally entitled to, Green Party disability spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said today.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeal earlier this year upheld an Employment Court ruling that workers in the disability care sector should be paid the minimum wage while doing sleepover shifts. The Government has offered these workers a much smaller amount than they think is fair.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has just as much of an obligation to workers in the care sector as they do to investors in South Canterbury Finance,&quot; said Ms Delahunty.</p>
<p>&quot;The New Zealand legal system has found that workers in the care sector have been grossly underpaid for the work they do.</p>
<p>&quot;Workers on their sleepover shifts are legally responsible for the health and safety of those they are caring for. This is not easy work.</p>
<p>&quot;We should respect those who do this night work,&quot; said Ms Delahunty.</p>
<p>&quot;These workers are away from their families, and don&#39;t deserve to be short changed with below par offers.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Government can bail out investors who went looking for looking for high returns in South Canterbury Finance then it should pay care workers what they are legally owed.&quot;</p>
