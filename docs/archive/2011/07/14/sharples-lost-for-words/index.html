<p><strong>Sharples Lost for Words</strong></p>
<p>Maori Party co-leader and Minister of Maori Affairs Dr Pita Sharples is still unable to state a case for preferential treatment for Maori, notes ACT New Zealand’s Parliamentary Leader Hon John Boscawen.</p>
<p>In Parliament’s Question Time this afternoon, Mr Boscawen asked Dr Sharples if he stood by his claim during a debate on Maori TV with ACT Leader Dr Don Brash, that special measures were necessary to change the situation whereby Maori were under-achieving.</p>
<p>“Dr Sharples answered, ‘Aye, yes,’ but when pressed by me for examples of how ‘special measures’ had lifted Maori out of under-achievement, was unable to do so,” says Mr Boscawen.</p>
<p>“I wanted to know how ‘special measures’ had reduced illiteracy, unemployment, diabetes and other obesity-related diseases among Maori, in line with his statements during the Native Affairs debate. Again, Dr Sharples dropped the ball, vaguely suggesting I ask the question of society-at-large, or myself.</p>
<p>“Dr Sharples shouldn’t so readily trivialise these issues. ACT has incurred much odium from Dr Sharples and his colleagues for its campaign against separatism, yet when asked to point to the benefits of separatist measures, Dr Sharples could only offer monosyllabic and meaningless responses.</p>
<p>“Maori deserve better. ACT’s policy on youth rates, for example, would see thousands of Maori youth currently languishing on the dole, in work.</p>
<p>“Dr Sharples voted against Sir Roger Douglas’s private member’s Bill that would have reinstated youth rates.</p>
<p>“I invite him to rethink his approach and join the ACT Party in rejecting separatism and promulgating policies that really help Maori - and all disadvantaged, regardless of their skin colour,” Mr Boscawen concludes.</p>
