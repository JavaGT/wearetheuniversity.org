<p><strong>Rt. Hon Winston Peters</strong><br><strong>Leader NZ First</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>July 23 2011</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Please Explain Where The Jobs Are - Peters</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First has called on the government to explain exactly how it is going to create 170,000 new jobs over the next four years.</p>
<p>This follows reported comments by the Nelson MP and cabinet minister Nick Smith that there was no &quot;quick fix&quot; to the unemployment situation.</p>
<p>Rt. Hon Winston Peters says the Budget in May clearly stated that 170,000 new jobs would be created but since then well over three thousand people have lost their jobs.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of people looking for work, waiting for the government’s confident prediction to start showing some sign of reality.</p>
<p>“It appears that they will be waiting a long time before anything to happen and it is interesting that the comments of Nick Smith bear no resemblance to the optimistic Budget forecast.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says the economy is wallowing in a trough while international foreign exchange speculators have a field day throwing the New Zealand dollar into orbit.</p>
<p>“The exporters we need to help create jobs are hurting because of the artificially inflated Kiwi dollar and there appears to be no relief in sight.</p>
<p>“We cannot afford to sit and wait for some economic miracle to appear. The people need jobs now and a sensible plan to get the economy moving again is long overdue,” says Mr. Peters.</p>
