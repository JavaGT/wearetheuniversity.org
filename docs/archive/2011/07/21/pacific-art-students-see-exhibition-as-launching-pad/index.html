<h3>Pacific art students see exhibition as launching pad for career</h3>
<p>Nine young artists, selected from five Auckland tertiary institutions, are being given an opportunity to launch their artistic careers at this year’s Tautai Tertiary exhibition, which is being held at AUT’s ST PAUL St Gallery from Thursday, 21 July to Friday, 12 August.</p>
<p>The large scale contemporary exhibition, titled Finding Neitherland, is being curated by New Zealand-born Samoan artist, Graham Fletcher, and showcases work by emerging Pacific artists from AUT Art and Design School, Elam Art School (Auckland University), Whitecliffe, Manukau School of Visual Arts and Unitech.</p>
<p>The annual event is hotly contested, as it gives up-and-coming artists the unique opportunity to show their work in a gallery setting, take part in a critique with a leading New Zealand artist and art critic, as well as foster relationships with other artists – all important building blocks for launching an artistic career.</p>
<p>Christina Jeffery, manager, Tautai Contemporary Pacific Arts Trust says it’s a huge opportunity for students, many of whom have never exhibited their work before. “Most artists would give their eye teeth to show work at such an established gallery.”</p>
<p>The partnership struck between the Tautai Contemporary Pacific Arts Trust and AUT University’s ST PAUL St Gallery in 2008, is already sporting success stories with work purchased in 2010 by the James Wallace Arts Trust.</p>
<p>Vera Mey, assistant gallery director, ST PAUL St Gallery, AUT says that awareness of the show has grown over the four years, as has its reputation as a launching pad for young talented artists.</p>

<p>“Our aim has always been to develop a collegial relationship between tertiary art students across Auckland and present the most exciting and current work by students of Pacific heritage. The artists’ ongoing successes are a real bonus,’ she says.</p>
<p>Finding Neitherland opens at 5.30pm on Thursday 21 July at ST PAUL St Gallery 1&amp;2 with a performance by dancer, Terry Faleono. An artists and curators talk will take place at the gallery at 1pm on Saturday 23 July and is open to the general public.</p>
<p>The nine artists exhibiting are: Keishya Adams , Darcell Apelu, Jessica Hitchings, Michael Lee, Pilimi Manu, Ken Merrick, Keva Rands, Saimealafo Tapaleao and Mac Teariki</p>
