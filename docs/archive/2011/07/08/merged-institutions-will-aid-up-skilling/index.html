<p><strong>Merged institutions will aid up-skilling of young ready for economic growth says Deputy PM at Telford ceremony</strong>  </p>
<p>An entrance-way plaque marking the merger of Telford Rural Polytechnic, South Otago, and Lincoln University, Canterbury, was unveiled at Telford today (Friday 8 July) by the Deputy Prime Minister and MP for Clutha-Southland, the Hon. Bill English.</p>
<p>On 1 January this year, Telford Rural Polytechnic, founded in 1964 as a farm training institute, became Telford, a Division of Lincoln University, New Zealand’s third oldest university institution, founded in 1878 as a school of agriculture.</p>
<p>Lincoln University’s Chancellor, Tom Lambie, said the “vertical integration” provided by the merger offered “profound benefits” for educational provision in the agricultural and land-based sector, from sub-degree and undergraduate teaching and postgraduate research, to commercialisation and extension activities with industry.</p>
<p>Speaking at the unveiling, the Deputy Prime Minister drew attention to figures indicating that at the moment in New Zealand unemployment in the over 25-year age category was 4.6 percent in contrast to a disproportionately higher level of joblessness in younger age brackets.</p>
<p>Economic recovery made it important to have the young skilled-up ready to contribute to growth and capitalise on the career opportunities it would provide, he said.</p>
<p>Institutions like Lincoln University and its new Telford Division were experienced educational providers and had a significant role to play in providing the young with qualifications for fulfilling futures in a strong economy.</p>

<p>The former chair of the Telford Rural Polytechnic Council, David Yardley, said he and former Council members remained confident that a merged institution was the correct vision for the advancement of agricultural training in New Zealand. The Telford Division of Lincoln University would play a “tremendous and valuable role” in this for many years to come.</p>
<p>“More than ever this nation and the world needs farmers,” said Mr Yardley.</p>
