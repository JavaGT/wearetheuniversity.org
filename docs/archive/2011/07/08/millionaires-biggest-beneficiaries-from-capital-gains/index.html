<h3><strong>Treasury: Millionaires biggest beneficiaries from lack of a tax on capital gains</strong></h3>
<p>Millionaires are the biggest beneficiaries from of the lack of tax on capital gains while the vast majority of New Zealanders would be completely untouched by such a tax, Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman said today.</p>
<p>“Research produced by the Treasury and Inland Revenue shows that those on very high incomes gain disproportionately from the lack of a capital gains tax,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“In the USA, those earning $1 million or more derived 40 percent of their income from capital gains. The figure was similar in Australia, with those earning $1 million or more deriving 30 percent of their income from capital gains. Those on average incomes gain negligible income from capital gains.</p>
<p>“Treasury and Inland Revenue therefore conclude that a tax on capital gains (excluding the family home) in New Zealand would fall mostly on those on very high incomes thereby increasing the progressivity of the tax system.</p>
<p>“It’s Treasury’s way of saying that a capital gains tax is incredibly fair.”</p>
<p>The joint paper published by Treasury and the Inland Revenue Department used data from the United States and Australia to draw conclusions about the likely equity implications for a capital gains tax here. They found that a capital gains tax (excluding the family home) would increase the integrity of our tax system while raising an additional $4.5 billion in government revenues over time.</p>
<p>“The research highlights the fact that the bulk of interest and wage income was earned by those on lower incomes. This income is fully taxed,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“The largest proportion of capital gains is earned by those at the upper end of the income spectrum. This income currently remains untaxed.</p>
<p>“This tax loop-hole for those that can afford to own multiple properties needs to be closed.</p>
<p>“By defending the status quo, John Key is arguing those earning more than $1 million a year shouldn’t have to pay tax on 40 percent of their income while those on the average wage should pay tax on all their income.</p>
<p>“By refusing to implement a tax on capital gains, John Key is not protecting the interests of wage and salary earners.</p>
<p>“A capital gains tax is a fair, progressive tax — one that treats every dollar earned the same.”</p>
