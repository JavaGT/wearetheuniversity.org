<h3>Prestigious innovation award for university-based website</h3>
<p>An innovative University of Waikato website connecting scientists with schools has won a prestigious telecommunications award.</p>
<p>The Science Learning Hub won the Education category at the Telecommunications Users Association NZ (TUANZ) 2011 Innovation Awards held in Auckland recently. The awards honour innovation across New Zealand’s telecommunications sector and is attended by the who’s who of the telecommunications industry.</p>
<p>The judges commented that the Science Learning Hub showcases New Zealand to the world, increases the level of science awareness and is a driver for high quality content delivery. They said, “It is a shining example of collaboration in the highly competitive educational environment.”</p>
<p>Project Co-Director, former dean of the Faculty of Education and new Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Alister Jones says, “This award is recognition of a long-term vision to connect school science with cutting-edge New Zealand science.”</p>
<p>The Hub promotes student interest and engagement in science by providing contemporary, contextualised resources online for teachers of Years 5–10. It features interactive thinking tools and multimedia collections, including videos, interactives and timelines. The website provides a unique link between science research organisations, educational research and science teachers. Students are able to access the latest world-class research and can learn about everything from tsunamis, icy ecosystems to cycling aerodynamics.</p>
<p>The site’s project manager, Di Hartwell says winning the TUANZ award is an honour that recognises the efforts of all those involved. The Science Learning Hub was established in 2007 and is a national project. Waikato University’s Wilf Malcolm Institute of Educational Research manages the project, which receives funding from the Ministry of Science and Innovation. The university works in association with CWA New Media, New Zealand Universities, Crown Research Institutes, science organisations, companies and the Royal Society of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Setting the Hub apart is its relationship with New Zealand’s leading science researchers who actively participate in the content creation. The Hub demonstrates science in context – how contemporary scientists solve real-world problems that are relevant to students’ lives.</p>
<p>Educational research shows that this approach improves engagement and motivation in science learning. The Hub also provides advice, support, quality assurance and professional development for teachers.</p>
