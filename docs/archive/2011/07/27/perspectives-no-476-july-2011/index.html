<p><strong>A Beacon For US Trade Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>By Daniel J. Ikenson</strong><br>18 July 2011</p>
<p>With the Doha Round dead and the United States no longer capable of global trade leadership, Australia should be exporting a commodity it produces and other countries lack: enlightened trade policy thinking. While a paucity of understanding about trade and its benefits afflicts policy in most countries, some fundamentally sound, intellectually coherent ideas have gained traction in Australia. Sixteenth-century mercantilist dogma may still dominate trade policymaking in Washington, but in Canberra the government has set a 21st-century course by espousing and embracing the real benefits of trade. Of course, it helps that Australia&#39;s Trade Minister is an economist with a PhD in international trade (and not a back-slapping former mayor who favours the path of least resistance).</p>
<p>The Gillard government published a paper in April conveying its view of trade policy as a tool to increase national prosperity. The document is striking in its contrast to the zero-sum world view permeating the Obama administration&#39;s plan to double US exports by 2014 and &quot;win the future&quot;. In rejecting the &quot;exports good, imports bad&quot; mantra, the document is a refreshingly novel exposition of the manifestation of trade&#39;s benefits.</p>
<p>Indeed, the ideas embodied in three of the document&#39;s guiding principles — unilateralism, transparency and the indivisibility of trade policy from broader economic policy — are as close to universal truths as one will find outside the realm of the physical sciences. But those truths contradict the favoured sports metaphors and the &quot;us versus them&quot; characterisations of trade to which policymakers and much of the public have grown accustomed.</p>
