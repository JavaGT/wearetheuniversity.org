<p>For immediate release:</p>

<p>University to Establish Study Centre in Castle Street</p>
<p>The University of Otago Council has approved a proposal to establish a new study and social centre at the site of the former Gardens Tavern in Castle Street. This will help to meet a need, which was identified in the Campus Master Plan, for more study and social spaces as the student roll has increased in recent years.</p>
<p>The current building on the property will be modified and upgraded to provide study spaces for up to 250 students. Apart from self-learning and group learning spaces, the building will incorporate leading-edge technological capabilities (including an audio-visual suite) and a small café. There are also plans for landscaping the area around the building, which will provide attractive courtyard areas for study and relaxation.</p>
<p>Announcing the decision, Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg said the centre will provide students with a warm and comfortable environment for study in both group and self-learning modes. &quot;This should be a really attractive venue for students living in the northern part of the city. It is possible that similar campus &#39;hubs&#39; may be developed elsewhere in the future.&quot;</p>
<p>The new facility is to be called the Marsh Study Centre. The University sought agreement to use this name from Mr Graeme Marsh, his wife Eunice and their extended family. Mr Marsh is a Dunedin business leader; he and his family have made a substantial donation towards the cost of the project.</p>

<p>Professor Skegg thanked the Marsh family for their generosity. &quot;We are delighted that the new study centre will carry their name. During his student years, Graeme Marsh was a member of the OUSA Executive for two years; he was later President of the Graduates&#39; Association Committee and then a member of the University Council and its Investment Committee for more than a decade. At a time when funds for capital developments are severely limited, it is wonderful to receive philanthropic support of this kind.&quot;<br>ends</p>
