<p>Students remember Dame Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan</p>
<p>Joint VUWSA-NZUSA press release</p>
<p>Student leaders are remembering the passing of a wahine toa of the student movement.</p>
<p>Dame Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan ONZ was elected as Women’s Vice-President to the 1960-1961 Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) Executive becoming its first Maori woman member.</p>
<p>While on the VUWSA Executive she campaigned to have te reo Maori offered at Victoria, pushed for better student health facilities and was a keen advocate for the proposed new Student Union Building. She was also an active member of the University Fencing Club.</p>
<p>VUWSA President Seamus Brady said Dame Whetu was part of a tradition of student representatives and students’ associations who have pushed for greater students’ rights, stronger pastoral care, a better and more inclusive education system, and adherence to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
<p>“It is fitting that the same proposed Student Union Building she advocated for over fifty years ago has just completed a student-funded $4 million upgrade and now boasts a purpose built student health and counselling facility – Mauri Ora and dedicated space for our Maori roopuu Ngai Tauira.”</p>
<p>“People like Dame Whetu and the students’ association they were a part of many decades ago are the reason the students of today enjoy such a wide ranging education and student experience”.</p>
<p>New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) Co-President David Do said Dame Whetu also made a significant contribution to the advancement of Maori education at a national level.</p>

<p>“Students today continue to benefit from her legacy of work in education and society. She helped establish the New Zealand Maori Students&#39; Federation and served as its first President. NZUSA has a Treaty relationship with its successor, the current national Maori students’ association Te Mana Akonga.”</p>
<p>VUWSA and NZUSA extend our sympathies to Dame Whetu’s whanau and friends.</p>
