<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong><br><strong>DATE</strong> Wednesday, 13 July 2011<br><strong>FROM</strong> Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association</p>
<p><strong>Campus Safety Audit Launched by Students’</strong></p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) has launched a Campus Safety Audit, to better understand student perceptions and experiences of campus safety.</p>
<p>VUWSA President Seamus Brady said a recent survey of over 4000 students showed campus safety was a key issue of concern for some groups of students.</p>
<p>“VUWSA is dedicated ensuring the experiences of students at Victoria are positive in all aspects. This includes students feeling like they are studying in a safe academic and social environment. Sadly however, for some students, this is not always the case.”</p>
<p>An anonymous student safety survey is the first stage of the Audit and will be followed by focus groups involving specific groups of student demographics. A physical assessment of areas of concern highlighted by students will then be carried out to supplement the information gathered.</p>
<p>The Audit results will be used to make a series of recommendations for VUWSA and the University to address, as well as providing student input into Victoria’s review of safety and security on campus.</p>
<p>VUWSA is the official representative body of students at Victoria University of Wellington and has been proudly advocating their issues since 1899.</p>
