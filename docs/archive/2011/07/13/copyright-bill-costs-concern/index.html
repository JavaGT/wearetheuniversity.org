<p><strong>Wednesday, 13 July 2011, 10:39 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Copyright bill costs concern</p>
<p>The Government looks to have seriously under-estimated the processing costs of its new copyright law and the number of infringement notices expected as a result of it, Labour&#39;s Communications and IT spokesperson Clare Curran says.</p>
<p>&quot;While the costs of processing alleged copyright infringements have, to some extent, been recognised with the decision to charge rights holders - predominantly US movie studios and record labels - up to $25, ISPs estimate the cost could actually be as high as $56 per notice.</p>
<p>&quot;And that doesn&#39;t include indirect costs or the cost to establish a new or upgraded system to process infringement notices,&quot; Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the Government has attempted to reach a compromise between the demands of right holders for very low processing fees, and those of internet service providers who will bear the cost of processing alleged copyright infringement notices, it&#39;s likely we will see a flood of notices from the big distribution companies into New Zealand, once the law comes into force.</p>
<p>&quot;Estimating the cost for affected rights holders is not straightforward. The Government suggests there will be up to 500 cases of infringement taken to the Copyright Tribunal in a year, yet previous estimates put the figure closer to 5,000 per month per ISP.</p>
<p>&quot;Some ISPs told the select committee they already received tens of thousands of infringement notices each month, despite there being no law in place to enforce them,&quot; Clare Curran said.</p>

<p>&quot;New Zealand&#39;s current intellectual property framework is not well designed to promote innovation and growth in our economy. Laws designed centuries ago to create economic incentives for innovation by protecting creators&#39; rights are today obstructing innovation and economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour remains opposed to termination of Internet access as an ultimate penalty for repeat copyright infringement and is committed to removing this provision. Labour will announce a comprehensive policy on copyright in the lead-up to the election,&quot; Clare Curran said.</p>
