<p><strong>Students say NO to Youth Rates!</strong></p>
<p>Students are this week rallying against the Government&#39;s attack on young workers&#39; rights to earn a living wage, in a campaign organised by Young Labour.</p>
<p>“Youth rates are discriminatory and the possibility of their reintroduction is bad news for young people,” Young Labour President Ella Hardy says.</p>
<p>“This week we will be rallying at campuses around the country to gather photo petition against the policy.”</p>
<p>Hardy encourages those who think youth rates are unfair to take a photo with a sign indicating they say &#39;NO to Youth Rates&#39;.</p>
<p>“ We need to stand up and say it&#39;s not okay to be paid less for doing the same work as somebody else, just because we&#39;re young,” she says.</p>
<p>She says the policy undermines the Kiwi value of fairness by sacrificing &#39;equal pay for equal work&#39; in favour of helping large corporations.</p>
<p>“This is a ruse to help big business increase their profits. John Key wants wages to go down. We want them to go up.”</p>
<p>Ms Hardy says if National really cares about young people it should take the initiative to create news jobs and tackle the rising cost of living.</p>
<p>Young Labour&#39;s Union Representative Chelsea Torrance says young people want sustainable job opportunities, but are instead losing their work rights and facing having their pay cut while the cost of living rises.</p>
<p>“At the election young people should consider voting for Labour&#39;s plan to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour instead of National&#39;s plan to pay young people up to $7 less than the current minimum wage,” Ms Torrance says.</p>

<p>“When Labour abolished youth rates with the help of the Greens, it was about fairness. Our current plan to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour is based on that same fairness.”</p>
