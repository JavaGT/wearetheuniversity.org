<p><strong>Monday, 18 July 2011, 12:03 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>For Immediate Release</p>
<p>Presidential Prison – VSM Protest</p>
<p>Otago University Students’ Association student President, Logan Edgar, will be starting his protest against the proposed VSM Bill. For two nights, from 7pm Monday the 18th, Logan will be locking himself in his “Presidential Prison” to protest the VSM (Freedom of Association Amendment Bill) currently awaiting its final reading before Parliament.</p>
<p>Logan plans to spend two nights in his cage (out in the cold) on the Union Lawn until 1pm Wednesday the 20th of July. Logan’s lock in coincides with one of the final dates that the Act Party proposed Bill could be passed by parliament before the election, and he is determined to promote to the nation how the bill will affect the services provided by OUSA and other student associations throughout New Zealand. The aim is to have all University campuses around the country linked up with Logan via a 24hour a day webcam in a ‘happy feet’ style set up, and projector screens in all their major campus hubs to promote the issue.</p>
<p>Logan says, “The government hasn’t listened to the 98% of submissions that opposed the bill.” He goes on to say, “They’re are locking us out, so I’m locking myself in to make a stand to protect the wide variety of services students associations offer their students. I’ll be in the cage until John Campbell turns up,” he then jokingly added, “but it’s OK if it’s a ‘bad time of the month’ for him, we’re a diverse and accepting bunch down here at OUSA.<br>ends</p>
