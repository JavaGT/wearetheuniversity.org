<p><strong>Universities NZ welcomes incoming Minister for Tertiary Education</strong></p>
<p>Universities New Zealand-Te Pōkai Tara welcomes today’s announcement that Steven Joyce will serve another term as the Minister for Tertiary Education as well as be the new Minister for Science and Innovation.</p>
<p>The universities have enjoyed a constructive working relationship with the Minister over the last two years and look forward to continuing to work together on key issues facing the universities.</p>
<p>Research and development is the cornerstone of innovation and growth and universities are the largest research organisations in New Zealand. They employ more than half the country’s research staff, train nearly all its postgraduate students - the researchers and professionals of the future – and lead the way in the commercialisation of research results.</p>
<p>Ensuring that New Zealand maintains a high quality university system is of fundamental importance to the future of this country.</p>
<p>“Universities deliver positive returns to both individuals and the country as a whole for years to come,” says incoming Chair Pat Walsh.</p>
<p>“The ability to reap those rewards, however, is dependent on adequate and sustainable levels of private and public investment that will ensure New Zealand’s university system is underpinned by appropriately resourced institutions delivering internationally competitive education and research.”</p>
