<p><strong>Realising a dream for higher education</strong></p>
<p>Sione Paea from Tonga will be graduating with a PhD in Mathematics from Victoria University on Tuesday, with his wife and four children proudly looking on.</p>
<p>The thirst for higher education runs in the family—his wife Mele Katea is currently studying towards a PhD in Management and hopes to finish in two years’ time. Mr Paea also says he will encourage his children, currently aged between 6 and 13, to go on to higher education after they finish high school.</p>
<p>“Education is essential if you want to have a good life, unless you’re really good at sport,” he says.</p>
<p>“I really hope that Pacific people will look at what my wife and I have achieved and realise that if we can do it, they can too.”</p>
<p>Mr Paea is hoping to receive funding to pursue postdoctoral study next year, with the goal of eventually becoming a lecturer in mathematics. “I really love mathematics,” he says. “From an early age I hated reading, but when I discovered numbers everything suddenly made sense.</p>
<p>“English is my second language and I was really grateful to my lecturers at Victoria when I first started studying at the University—sometimes I would have to ask them to repeat their lesson more slowly after the class and they were always patient and willing to help.</p>
<p>“I’m also extremely grateful to Liz Richardson, the Deputy Dean (Equity) of the Faculties of Science, Engineering, and Architecture and Design; and Āwhina, the University’s support network for Māori and Pacific science students, which has mentors in higher study, and which helped me out when I needed assistance.”</p>
<p>Now an Āwhina mentor himself, Mr Paea takes great pleasure from helping out new students.</p>
<p>“It feels really good to give something back,” he says.</p>
<p><strong>Background information</strong><br>While the numbers of Pasifika people in New Zealand studying at Bachelor level or above have increased in the last five years, they are still under-represented in higher level study. Completion rates for Pasifika students are also lower than for any other ethnic group.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Pasifika) Luamanuvao Hon Winnie Laban, Victoria University has a strategy in place to increase recruitment, retention and completion rates of Pasifika students, as well as to encourage them to continue studying beyond Bachelor level.</p>
