<p>USU STUDENTS&#39; ASSOCIATION AT UNITEC</p>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p><strong>Students Vote for Unitec&#39;s Lecturer of the Year</strong></p>
<p>Susan White of the Department of Nursing was officially named the Unitec students&#39; top lecturer for 2011 in the USU and Unitec official Lecturer of the Year poll.</p>
<p>Susan&#39;s 2011 award marks the fifth time she has been named Lecturer of the Year at Unitec. She took home the award in 2004, 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2011!</p>
<p>Having been the recipient of the prestigious student selected award for three consecutive years, USU Students&#39; Association at Unitec&#39;s Ashley Smith sat down with Susan White to discuss the secrets in the classroom which make Sue such a favourite lecturer amongst the students.</p>
<p>White reflects, &quot;I think you have to have fun. I&#39;ve been teaching for a long time and teachers and lessons can be really boring.so I figure if I can have fun, at least one person is having fun. If they aren&#39;t laughing with me, they can laugh at me&quot;</p>
<p>Susan explains the fundamentals of creating a &quot;feeling&quot; in the classroom, because that is what students will walk away remembering. Her approach to teaching and learning is highly interactive and participatory.</p>
<p>&quot;I try to use humour, and I try to make it interesting by.using pictures and getting them [students] involved as much as possible&quot;</p>
<p>The USU and Unitec Lecturer of the Year gives students an opportunity to acknowledge lecturers that they feel have gone out of their way for students and made their experience at Unitec memorable.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Susan White and all other department winners for this year&#39;s awards. Each winner is a true asset to the Unitec community.</p>
