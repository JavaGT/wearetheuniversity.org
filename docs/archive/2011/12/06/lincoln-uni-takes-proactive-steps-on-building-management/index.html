<p>Lincoln University takes proactive steps on building management</p>
<p>Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Roger Field today addressed the campus to notify staff and students that, after reviewing structural assessments, he has made the decision to move staff out of two of the University’s buildings.</p>
<p>Structural engineers Beca have been undertaking full displacement-based seismic assessments involving extensive modelling for the University.</p>
<p>“Since the earthquakes, the University, like many other organisations has continued to regularly assess the environment we operate in. Engineers from Beca have been undertaking thorough assessments of our buildings, and we have found that two have been assessed at a risk level the University is not prepared to accept. Although the structural status of the buildings remains unchanged – and our Certificate to Occupy remains in place, we have chosen to take a prudent course of action to vacate the buildings at this time,” says Professor Field.</p>
<p>The University has engaged external, expert assistance to enable them to very quickly undertake a space audit to ensure all the occupants of the buildings can be relocated to other spaces as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The two buildings affected are the Hilgendorf Wing and the Student Union.</p>
<p>“We are fortunate that we have a spacious campus and as a result, we are confident we will remain fully operational. There will be absolutely no diminishment of academic standards and the learning opportunities for our students will be maintained at their customary standard of excellence. We are fortunate that these reports have come through at a time when most of our undergraduate students are not on campus and we are looking forward to being ready for semester one next year.</p>
<p>“The next step for us is to work closely with our staff and postgraduate students to ensure the relocation process goes smoothly for them,” adds Professor Field.</p>
