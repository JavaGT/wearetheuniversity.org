<p><strong>Monday, 19 December 2011, 4:34 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Gerry Brownlee<br><strong>Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery</strong></p>
<p>19 December 2011 <strong>Media Statement</strong></p>
<p><strong>More Port Hills properties zoned green</strong></p>
<p>Following a Cabinet decision today a further 1600 homes in the Port Hills area in Christchurch have been rezoned from the white to green zone.</p>
<p>Affected homeowners will be able to clarify their new zoning from tomorrow by visiting <a href="http://www.landcheck.org.nz/">www.landcheck.org.nz</a></p>
<p>A statement will be made by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) when the information has been updated on the Landcheck website, and letters to those residents affected will be mailed to them by CERA tomorrow.</p>
<p>&quot;This means those homeowners will be able to get on with the process of rebuilding and repairing their homes if they were damaged by the earthquakes,&quot; Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee said.</p>
<p>&quot;They will need to keep working with EQC and their private insurer as claim assessments are continuing on a property-by-property basis.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Brownlee said it had taken considerable time and resources to compile and analyse the data to make today’s decision.</p>
<p>&quot;This decision brings the total number of properties in the Port Hills area zoned green to more than 11,300.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still around 2100 homes that remain in the white zone in the Port Hills areas. Working with the Christchurch City Council and EQC to rezone these properties and the around 900 properties still in the orange zone on the flats remains CERA&#39;s highest priority,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I appreciate the incredible frustration these homeowners will be experiencing and I want to assure them we are working hard to get some certainty for them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to ensure we make the best decision for the owners of the properties that remain orange or white and I thank them for their great patience as we continue this important work.&quot;</p>
<p>CERA is responsible for coordinating and leading the rebuild of Canterbury and supporting the welfare of its residents. For more information visit <a href="http://www.cera.govt.nz/">www.cera.govt.nz</a></p>
