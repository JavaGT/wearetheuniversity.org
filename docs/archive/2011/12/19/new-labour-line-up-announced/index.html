<p>David<br>SHEARER<br>Labour Leader<br>19 December 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>New Labour line-up announced</strong></p>
<p>David Shearer today announced Labour’s new line-up that promotes new faces and focuses on Labour&#39;s priorities for a clean, green and innovative New Zealand that supports strong families and communities.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has a lot of work to do to refresh our connections with New Zealanders. I have built a team that brings forward new faces. They will have responsibility in the key areas we want to emphasise in developing our vision for New Zealand.</p>
<p>“I am also giving senior responsibilities to experienced MPs who will contribute to this new vision.</p>
<p>“We are going to change our tone and we are going to take a fresh look at our priorities.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very proud of the team who will lead the change and help lead Labour into the future,&quot; David Shearer said.</p>
<p>“Our caucus is united, energised and ready for action. Labour has a fresh vision and a plan to grow our economy so that we make the most of our talented, creative workforce and create a country where all Kiwis can flourish.</p>
<p>“We want to put an end to the growing gap between the rich and the rest of New Zealand and believe the way forward is to nurture our innovative and creative sectors. That is reflected in the portfolios that feature prominently among Labour’s new line-up,” said David Shearer.</p>
<p>Labour’s reshuffle is based on a Shadow Cabinet with the top 20 MPs ranked, while the remaining members are not ranked but are listed in order based on their seniority.</p>

<p>David Shearer will hold the portfolio of Science and Innovation, indicating his commitment to this sector and its importance in terms of Labour’s economic plan.</p>
<p>Deputy Leader Grant Robertson will be responsible for the Environment, Tertiary Education, and Skills and Training portfolios, reinforcing our focus on a clean, green, clever New Zealand.</p>
<p>David Parker takes up Finance and Jacinda Ardern will be the new Social Development spokesperson.</p>
<p>David Cunliffe will responsible for Economic Development and will be an Associate Finance Spokesman.</p>
<p>Clayton Cosgrove has SOEs, Associate Finance, Commerce, Small Business and Trade Negotiations, Shane Jones has Regional Development and Associate Finance, while Nanaia Mahuta takes over Education.</p>
<p>“I am determined to make use of the talents all of our MPs have – with 34 MPs I need all my team contributing fully. Everyone has a significant responsibility.</p>
<p>“I have made clear that I will be looking closely at the performance of every MP and strong performers will be rewarded.</p>
<p>“This is a fresh start for Labour and is the beginning of the journey from Opposition back to Government in 2014”</p>
