<p>Dalziel</p>
<p>Christchurch East MP  </p>
<p>1 December 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>Student creation lights the way</p>
<p>The roaring success of a sustainable energy transfer device, dubbed the “Lion”, has been recognised by Labour MP for Christchurch East, Lianne Dalziel, who will host a special lunch for its creators at Parliament on Friday.</p>
<p>The team from St Thomas of Canterbury College Technology has taken the top regional honours in the Lion Foundation Young Enterprise Scheme with the device, which can power cell-phones, lights and radios during power cuts</p>
<p>Originally developed as a solution to the post-earthquake blackouts, 24 prototypes were made and tested before the finished Lion was considered market ready.</p>
<p>It has since been adapted - through various business partnerships forged with Kathmandu, Mitre 10, Tait Electronics, DHL and the New Zealand Public Service Association - to use solar power as a means of also powering laptops.</p>
<p>Campers were identified as a secondary market and production of Lion is continuing to supply retail outlets.</p>
<p>Lianne Dalziel, a former Minister of Commerce, who has long been supportive of this school’s participation in the Young Enterprise Scheme, will greet the students and their mentors at Parliament tomorrow before hosting them to lunch in the Members’ Dining Room as special acknowledgement of their tremendous success.</p>
<p>The awards, to be presented at a dinner on Friday, attended by the Governor General are as follows:</p>
