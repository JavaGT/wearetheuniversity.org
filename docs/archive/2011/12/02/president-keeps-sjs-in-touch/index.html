<p><strong>Friday, 2 December 2011, 5:24 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>President keeps SJS in touch</strong></p>
<p>After leading the way to keep Student Job Search in touch with students after they announced the closure of their offices, Logan Edgar, OUSA President has been elected onto the SJS National Council. It’s a move that keeps the South Island Universities and Polytechnics linked in with the Wellington based council, and will allow the voice of southern students looking to improve the service to be heard a little clearer and hopefully reflect in higher job numbers.</p>
<p>“The Otago SJS has high usage thanks to both, students job hunting, and the Otago region going to the service when they need employees or just a little bit of help around the house.” Said Logan Edgar. “And it works, students of Otago this year earned over 3.8 million dollars and on average earned about $1,250, that’s success in our eyes.”</p>
<p>Mr. Edgar was elected by the presidents of students’ associations around the country achieving 35 out of 55 votes by Polytechnic and University representatives after another one of his now infamous campaign videos was sent out to the Presidents to try and achieve the votes.</p>
<p>“We’ve stepped up and set up SJS Connect kiosks at our offices and it’s that type of ingenuity we want to keep coming up with to keep SJS connected. It’s about embracing the technology, which is a must being so far away from the main hub of the north, plus I think adding a little bit of humour in all the serious banter helps.” Says Mr. Edgar.</p>
<p>OUSA will continue to offer the free SJS Connect kiosks which include internet access and a free phone linked with the SJS call centre into 2012 as demand has been high in both the Clubs and Societies and Main offices.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day the most important thing is that we get students jobs, it takes pressure off student debt, gives students something outside of just Uni to focus on and keeps SJS relevant and running.” Said Mr. Edgar.</p>
<p>The final result saw the North and South islands equally represented on the council.</p>
