<p><strong>Friday, 2 December 2011, 9:25 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_Of_The_South_Pacific">University Of The South Pacific</a></strong></p>
<p>30th November, 2011</p>
<p>After successful blood drives at the University of the South Pacific’s Laucala Campus earlier in the year, a similar initiative was launched by the USP Lautoka Campus for the Western Division in Fiji.</p>
<p>In its first-ever blood drive, the Lautoka Campus collected a total of 52 pints of blood which has the capacity to save over 150 lives. Held at the Sugar City Mall in Lautoka on 12 November 2011, the blood drive was part of the Campus initiative to give back to the local community and encourage youths to participate in the worthy cause to save lives.<br>A recent proposal by the Campus Life Group Manager, Mr Glenn Pope led to the formation of a committee comprising of staff, who liaised with the Lautoka Hospital to organise the event.<br>The Chairman of the Blood Drive Organising Committee at the Lautoka Campus, Mr Dennis Sen was pleased with the response from students who took out time from their busy study schedules to donate blood.</p>
<p>“It was good to see that many young people were interested in donating blood. We took out time to explain to them and others on the importance of donating blood,” he mentioned.<br>Mr Sen said that the blood drive attracted a lot of donors that included students and staff of the Lautoka Campus, a majority of them being first-time donors who will most likely become full-time donors.</p>
<p>To create awareness for the blood drive, notices were placed in and around Lautoka city, community messages were aired on major radio stations, and Vodafone txt messages were sent to regular donors at the Lautoka Hospital. Following a positive response from those who had turned up to donate blood, there are plans by the Lautoka Campus to continue and incorporate this initiative as a bi-annual or quarterly event.</p>

<p>Mr Pope elaborated that after the success of the blood drive in Lautoka, the USP Campus Life is planning to expand this campaign to other USP regional campuses. He applauded the Lautoka Campus Director, Dr Pramila Devi and her staff for their efforts in organising the blood drive.<br>During the blood drive, the Campus also marketed its courses and programmes offered through Distance and Flexible Learning (DFL) as well as Continuing and Community Education (CCE).</p>
