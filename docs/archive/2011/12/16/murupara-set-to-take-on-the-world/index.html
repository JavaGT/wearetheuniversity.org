<p><strong>Murupara set to take on the world</strong></p>
<p>Māori Party MP for Waiariki, Te Ururoa Flavell, is praising the efforts of two Murupara teens who were recently selected to represent New Zealand at the International Boxing Competition in Serbia.</p>
<p>&quot;Roxaine and Aroha, who both recently received Gold Medals at the National competition, can be very proud of their achievements and the contribution this will make to the Murupara community,” says Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>“They are role-models for their peers and no doubt their achievements will be proudly celebrated amongst their whānau,” he adds.</p>
<p>Roxaine Duff-Halkett and Aroha Sorenson are both students of Rangitahi College and are currently fundraising for their trip to Serbia which will take place in January next year.</p>
<p>&quot;The community are rallying together to fundraise for the pair and I am told that the Board of Trustees of Rangitahi College are currently requesting for koha to go towards their $6000 trip so if you would like to support the girls please do so by calling the College.”</p>
<p>&quot;With all the negative press regarding Murupara recently I ask why stories such as Roxaine and Aroha’s become less news-worthy? I would think that achievements such as this would be considered more productive,” ends Mr Flavell.</p>
