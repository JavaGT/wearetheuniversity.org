<p>POROPOROAKI<br><strong>Hon Tariana Turia and Hon Dr Pita Sharples</strong><br><strong>Maori Party Co-Leaders</strong><br><strong>16 December 2011</strong></p>
<p><strong>Poroporoaki ki Te Pae ki Omeka Ruha, ONZM, QSM</strong></p>
<p>Kei te haruru te tangi o nga iwi ki nga paripari o Tikirau!<br>E whawhati ana nga tai ki te Rawhiti.<br>E pouri ana nga iwi huri noa i te motu, i te wahangutanga o tera kuia i pakanga mutunga kore mo te reo Maori me nga tikanga, kia tukuna ki nga uri whakatipu.</p>
<p>E te uri o Apanui, o Porourangi,<br>E te whakaruruhau mo nga iwi noho i te Upoko o te Ika,<br>E te pou o te Ropu Wahine Maori Toko i te Ora, o Te Atarangi, o Nga Kaiwhakapumau i te Reo, o te Reo Irirangi o te Upoko o te Ika,<br>Kuia o Te Herenga Waka marae i te Whare Wananga o Wikitoria, kaiako i te reo Maori ki te tini mano mai ra ano –<br>Takoto mai, takoto mai, takoto mai!</p>
<p>The Maori Party is very sad to hear of the passing this morning of Te Pae ki Omeka Ruha, of Te Whanau a Apanui and Ngati Porou.</p>
<p>“Auntie Pae was a stalwart of the Maori language movement, the Maori Women’s Welfare League, Te Atarangi, and many other organisations promoting Maori language, culture and social development,” said Co-leader Dr Pita Sharples.</p>
<p>“Pae trained as a teacher, and education has been the driving force of her life. She taught for many years at the Correspondence School, at a time when te reo Maori was not widely available in secondary schools.</p>
<p>“She was also a founding member of Nga Kaiwhakapumau i te Reo, the Wellington Maori Language Board, a staunch supporter of Te Ataarangi, and a long-time trustee of Te Upoko o te Ika, the first Maori radio station.</p>

<p>“She was a leading judge of kapa haka and language and cultural competitions. In everything she did, Pae was a stickler for accuracy, for correct language, and proper application of tikanga tuku iho,” said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>“Pae was a proud life member of the Maori Women’s Welfare League, and travelled to all their national conferences,” said Co-leader Tariana Turia. “She was a steadying influence and a voice of wisdom to younger members of the League. She was always willing to lend her support to rising generations, and attended huge numbers of hui to offer her guidance and mana.</p>
<p>&quot; She was also an original member of Te Atamira Taiwhenua, the national Maori advisory group to the Department of Internal Affairs. Her wisdom and indepth knowledge of te Ao Maori has also been of direct benefit to the public service in so many ways.</p>
<p>“Pae was awarded the QSM and ONZM for her services to Maori people, and she recently became a Hunter Fellow in recognition of her contribution to Victoria University, particularly her staunch support to their marae since its inception in 1986. So it is appropriate that she should lie at Te Herenga Waka marae, before returning to her ancestral home among Te Whanau a Apanui,” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>E te whaea, e te kuia, haere, haere, haere ki o tipuna i te Po!</p>
