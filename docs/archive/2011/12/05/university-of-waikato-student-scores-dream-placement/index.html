<p>5 December 2011<br>**University of Waikato student scores dream placement at Toshiba<br>**<br>University of Waikato mechanical engineering student Toni O’Sullivan is off to Tokyo to work with technology giant Toshiba.</p>
<p>Toni, 26, leaves for 11 weeks in Japan today (Dec 5) in what she describes as a dream work placement.</p>
<p>“Work placements are a requirement of our third year and I’d applied for a few others and then saw the placement with Toshiba advertised in student magazine Nexus,” says Toni.</p>
<p>“Six weeks after applying I got an email to say that I got it. Toshiba are covering the cost of my flights and providing me with a dormitory to live in. I will be engaged in an unpaid internship working on the development of vibration control technology for fields ranging from elevators and railways to washing machines.”</p>
<p>Before coming to Waikato, Toni spent a few years living in Perth after studying Japanese and Linguistics in Dunedin.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t entirely happy in the work I was doing in Perth. There was something missing, I missed doing things like maths and physics and was always good at them when I was at school. I got to know a few engineers and realised that’s what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>“With the internship it wasn’t specified that we have to speak Japanese, but my time studying Japanese in Dunedin probably helped.</p>
<p>“When I was in high school I went to Japan for two weeks and got by with my limited Japanese. It’s been five to six years now since I’ve spoken it but I’ve downloaded a few tablet apps to help reacquaint myself and I’m looking forward to brushing up via trial by fire.”</p>
<p>Next year Toni returns to the University of Waikato to complete her degree.</p>
