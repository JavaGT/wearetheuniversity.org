<p>High achievers heading to University of Canterbury in 2012</p>
<p>Several members of St Thomas of Canterbury College’s national award winning Young Enterprise Scheme team will be embarking on their tertiary studies at the University of Canterbury next year.</p>
<p>Two of the students, Sam Mackwell and Andrew Coburn, visited the University of Canterbury with St Thomas of Canterbury College’s principal Christine O’Brien, to meet with University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor, Dr Rod Carr today and update him on their success at the Young Enterprise Scheme national awards on 1 December.</p>
<p>This is the 30th year for the awards and the St Thomas’ team won three of the six national excellence awards, building on the school’s strong tradition of achievement in the competition. The team won the Todd Corporation Award for Excellence, the Movac Award for Business Growth Potential (founded by the initiators of Trade Me) and the Department of External Affairs and Trade Award for Aid Development. In addition, team member James Agnew won the inaugural New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountant’s student Managing Director of the Year Award.</p>
<p>Of the team Andrew is coming to the University of Canterbury next year to study to be an English teacher. James will be coming to UC to study commerce and Sam, who is currently in year 12, intends coming to UC to study Mechanical Engineering in 2013. Other team members are currently in India on an immersion experience at the late Mother Theresa of Calcutta’s centre.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be welcoming young people of such calibre at the University of Canterbury next year,” said University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor, Dr Rod Carr. “All of the team members have demonstrated a high level of initiative, innovation and tenacity as part of this year’s Young Enterprise Scheme competition and those qualities will stand Andrew, Sam and James in good stead as they embark on their tertiary studies with us.”</p>
<p>Dr Carr confirmed that applications from domestic students to enrol at UC for 2012 were in line with the same time last year.</p>
<p>The closing date for first time at UC students to apply to enrol is 10 December.</p>
