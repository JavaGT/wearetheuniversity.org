<p><strong>Show us where the money is coming from for charter schools John?</strong></p>
<p>John Key needs to show the public where the money is coming from for National and ACT’s charter schools roll-out, Green Party education spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said today.</p>
<p>Charter schools will be state-funded private schools free from the regulations and accountability currently binding public schools.</p>
<p>“National and ACT’s agreement to set-up and fund this form of private school is a huge policy to spring on the electorate post-election,” said Ms Delahunty.</p>
<p>“There have been no calls for charter schools from parents, and the capacity to be flexible to meet student needs already exists under current law.</p>
<p>“The public needs to know how much money Associate Education Minister John Banks will be getting for National and ACT’s stealthy shake up of the education system.</p>
<p>“The Government must also explain if new spending has been allocated for this project or if the spending will come from existing education baselines.</p>
<p>“State schools in the areas allocated for the trial of charter schools need every cent of the education budget so they can meet the needs of all students.</p>
<p>“If this policy is to come from the already stretched education budget then presumably cuts will have to be made that will affect those schools that are already struggling.</p>
<p>“John Key wanted to know exactly where money was coming from for other parties spending promises on the election trail,” said Ms Delahunty.</p>
<p>“The Key Government must now be upfront with how their policies will impact on the education budget.”</p>
