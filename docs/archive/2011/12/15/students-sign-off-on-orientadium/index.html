<p><strong>Students Sign Off on Orientadium</strong></p>
<p>This Friday (16 December), the University of Otago, their students association, OUSA, and the Forsyth Barr Stadium will announce a partnership that will make the 2012 Orientation festival the biggest Dunedin has ever seen.</p>
<p>“We are stoked to have the opportunity to christen the Stadium with its first Orientation which we’re all dubbing ‘<em>Orientadium</em>’,” says OUSA President, Logan Edgar, “With the University Union getting a flash new redevelopment, we’ve managed to work with the Uni and the Stadium to make sure we can put on an epic week of parties and entertainment in 2012.”</p>
<p>The Otago University Chief Operating Officer, John Patrick, and Mr. Edgar will meet with Dunedin Mayor, Dave Cull, and Dunedin Venues Chief Executive, David Davies, to look in on the new Plaza and check out the areas in the Stadium that OUSA will be using for its Orientation.</p>
<p>“We have been working with OUSA to ensure that students are delivered a fantastic start to their year at Otago. In 2012, the Orientation activities will include not only outstanding entertainment, but academic orientation will also play an important role in setting the stage for the new University year.” says Vice-Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne.</p>
<p>“Together, the University and OUSA have an exciting future ahead of us and O Week 2012 offers us the first of many opportunities to work together. The Forsyth Barr Stadium is the perfect venue for O Week. By February 2012, the University’s Plaza adjacent to the Stadium, including the brand new Unipol gymnasium, will be completed. I’m looking forward to personally welcoming new and returning students to Dunedin during some of the O Week events,” says Professor Hayne.</p>
