<p><strong>Captains of industry and sport among recipients of top Lincoln University awards</strong></p>
<p>Distinction in environmental advocacy, equine science, the export meat industry, international commodity production and sports leadership are recognised by Lincoln University with its top achievement awards announced today.</p>
<p>The awards – three honorary doctorates and two medals – will be presented at the University’s Graduation Ceremony on Friday 20 April 2012.</p>
<p>“We are always delighted to follow the well-established University tradition of publicly acknowledging contributions to society by outstanding citizens,” says Vice-Chancellor Professor Roger Field.</p>
<p>“This year Lincoln University’s Council has approved the conferment of honorary doctorates on the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, <strong>Dr Jan Wright</strong>; the head of ANZCO Foods, one of the country’s largest export beef and lamb suppliers, <strong>Sir Graeme Harrison</strong>; and the Captain of the Rugby World Cup winning All Blacks, <strong>Richie McCaw</strong>.</p>
<p>“In addition, the University’s Bledisloe Medal will be awarded to <strong>Dr Margaret Evans</strong>, an endocrinologist and equine scientist of international stature; and the Lincoln Alumni International Medal will be presented to <strong>John Clendon</strong>, managing director of Univanich Palm Oil Company, the world’s leading producer of sustainable palm oil.</p>
<p>“Each of these award recipients personifies values and virtues expressed in Lincoln University’s mission of transforming land, people and economies. Without question, their individual influences have been ‘transformative’.”</p>

<p><strong>Dr Jan Wright, Honorary Doctor of Science:</strong> Dr Jan Wright has been Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment since 2007. She is an independent Officer of Parliament and, with her staff, has the mission of maintaining or improving the quality of the environment by providing robust and independent advice that informs Members of Parliament on environmental issues and policies. Dr Wright is particularly interested in the interaction between environmental and economic interests. Her advocacy for the environment complements Lincoln University’s own commitment to environmental sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>Sir Graeme Harrison, Honorary Doctor of Commerce:</strong> Sir Graeme Harrison founded meat company giant ANZCO Foods in 1984 as a sheepmeat marketing company for the farmer-owned Meat Producers Board and subsequently led a buy-out of shares by management and other investors in the mid-1990s. ANZCO markets and guarantees year-round delivery of premium New Zealand beef and lamb products to over 80 countries worldwide. It has annual sales of over $1.2 billion, assets of over $500 million, and employs 2800 people at 11 production sites in New Zealand. Sir Graeme is a natural entrepreneur who champions New Zealand agribusiness and sees huge potential for the agricultural, forestry, seafood and mineral sectors in New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>Richard (Richie) McCaw, Honorary Doctor of Natural Resources:</strong> Richie McCaw, captain of the world champion All Blacks, has achieved the highest distinction possible in his sport of rugby by leading his team to victory in the 2011 Rugby World Cup tournament. As an individual player he became the first All Black to achieve 100 test caps, has been International Rugby Board International Player of the Year on three occasions, and was New Zealand Sportsman of the Year in 2010. His achievements for the Canterbury provincial and Crusaders Super 15 teams have been similarly outstanding. Richie has received the highest accolades for his leadership and is widely regarded as a role model for young people. Recognition for sport is consistent with the leadership role Lincoln University has taken in recreation and sports management over many years.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Margaret Evans, Bledisloe Medal:</strong> Dr Margaret Evans is an endocrinologist and equine scientist whose world-class scientific career has helped consolidate New Zealand as a leader in equine reproduction research. Dr Evans’ doctoral studies with the late Emeritus Professor of Veterinary Science Cliff Irvine, established Lincoln University and New Zealand as an international hub of equine research. When she began her studies, the reproduction rate of mares was the lowest of any domestic animal. Her work formed the basis for developing treatments now widely used internationally for improving horse fertility and the efficiency of stud management. Breeding strategies stemming from Dr Evans’ research have been important in keeping New Zealand at the forefront of a highly competitive global business. Dr Evans is a Scientific Officer in the Department of Endocrinology at Christchurch Hospital working in endocrinology relating to human health.</p>
<p><strong>John Clendon, Lincoln Alumni International Medal:</strong> John is an example of a Lincoln University alumnus who has risen to the highest level of respect in his chosen industry overseas, thus bringing credit to his university. He resides in Krabi, Thailand, where he is managing director of Univanich Palm Oil Company, the world’s leader in the production of sustainable palm oil. John has been involved in managing coconut, cocoa and oil palm plantations in the south-west Pacific and Asia since the late 1970s. He was palm oil operations director for the giant UK company Unilever in the 1990s, managing a joint venture that successfully amalgamated three of Thailand’s pioneer oil palm companies, creating Univanich Palm Oil Ltd. Unilever subsequently sold their stake in Univanich and the company listed on the Thailand Stock Exchange. John has managed the company through extraordinary growth and its share price has outperformed the market. In 2009 he was in the final four for Thailand’s Best CEO Award and the company is a three-time winner of the Best Performance Award of the Stock Exchange of Thailand. John has ensured that his company is the socially responsible, stand-out company of the palm oil industry.</p>
