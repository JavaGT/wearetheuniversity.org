<p><strong>University brings together scientists for coastal forum</strong></p>
<p>The University of Waikato is bringing together renowned coastal and marine scientists and Bay of Plenty iwi for a day-long public symposium in Tauranga in January.</p>
<p>The Coastal Economic Symposium, called <em>Treasuring the Bay, Whakamana te taonga o te Moana a Toi</em>, is a chance for the community to engage with experts about research and economic developments taking place in the Bay of Plenty as well as looking at the issues we face. It will be held on Friday 20 January.</p>
<p>University Partnership and Liaison Manager Dr Nigel Calder says the university wants to build on and develop the Summer School programme offered in Tauranga during the summer break by bringing together experts in a field and engaging the public in discussion and debate. It is possible that future symposiums would focus on different themes, he says.</p>
<p>“This will be a first for the university in Tauranga and we are looking forward to engaging people in the ongoing research occurring not only through the university but in the wider region as well.</p>
<p>“The Rena incident has placed the Bay’s recreational and economic resources into sharp focus and has emphasised the fragility of our coastal and marine environment. With the huge amount of work going on in coastal science here it was appropriate that our first symposium should focus on coastal and economic issues.”</p>
<p>Last week the university opened its new Tauranga coastal research field station, which will provide a base for several summer school students and staff conducting research during the holiday break.</p>
<p>A range of experts, including the university’s Chair in Coastal Science Professor Chris Battershill and Professor Rocky de Nys from James Cook University in Australia, will speak at the forum. Topics to be covered include aquaculture, marine pharmaceuticals, iwi economic development, biofuels/biochar and coastal research.</p>
<p>Summer School research students will also give a brief synopsis of their research projects.</p>
<p>The <em>Treasuring the Bay</em> symposium will be held from 9.00am-3.00pm, Friday 20 January at the Bongard Centre, 200 Cameron Road, Tauranga. Registration is $20 which includes morning tea and lunch.
