<p>Minister’s words ring hollow in wake of latest earthquakes</p>
<p>Labour warned the Government five months ago that there had to be a better process around Canterbury properties that border the red zoned land, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Lianne Dalziel.</p>
<p>“I wrote to the Minister on the 8th July and again on the 9th September highlighting the need for careful consideration around the green zoned properties that bordered the red zones,” Lianne Dalziel said.</p>
<p>“Five months later, and less than three weeks before the latest earthquakes, the Minister responded by accusing people of wanting to ‘second-guess’ the Government’s decisions.</p>
<p>“The Minister’s statement that recurring liquefaction and damage to properties were not determining factors in the decision will be cold comfort to those who have had to dig massive amounts of silt out of their properties for the third, fourth or fifth time, and those who have had to spend Christmas Day without water and sewerage.”</p>
<p>Lianne Dalziel said that although the Minister could not have known what would happen within three weeks of his letter, he should have been prepared to engage with the affected communities.</p>
<p>“The Minister’s words suggesting there were ‘no significant land issues that cannot be overcome’ in the green zones ring hollow in light of what occurred last Friday.</p>
<p>“Foundation solutions may protect houses from failure and ensure that they are readily repairable; but what about the surrounding infrastructure – when streets are flooded and large sink holes occur?</p>

<p>“Removing the silt is back-breaking and heart-breaking.”</p>
<p>Lianne Dalziel said that Parklands wasn’t mentioned in the correspondence with the Minister because it was orange at the time, and when the October announcements were made, people seemed to be generally relieved that they could stay.</p>
<p>“Friday’s experience has made people re-think that viewpoint. They will need a lot of reassurance before they will accept anything other than a red zone decision.</p>
<p>“The Minister must learn from this experience. There is local knowledge within these communities, which can and should help inform the decision-making,” Lianne Dalziel said.</p>
