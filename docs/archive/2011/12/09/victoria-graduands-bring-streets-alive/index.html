<p><strong>Victoria graduands bring streets alive</strong></p>
<p>Almost 1000 students, including 45 PhDs, will next week celebrate successfully completing their studies at Victoria University of Wellington’s December Graduation ceremonies and procession.</p>
<p>Overall, 341 of the total qualifications awarded will be from the Faculty of Commerce and Administration, 246 from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, and 153 from the Faculty of Science. Also graduating will be students from the faculties of Architecture &amp; Design; Education; Engineering; Law; Toihuarewa and the New Zealand School of Music.</p>
<p>Of the 45 PhDs, 19 are from the Faculty of Science, including James Matthews’ research into the effectiveness of a compound called pateamine in developing anti-cancer drugs and Daniel Crabtree’s research developing new algorithms that give web search engines a deeper understanding of the meaning behind a user&#39;s queries, so that future search engines will answer what people mean, not just what they type in.</p>
<p>Also graduating will be Miki Seifert, Victoria’s first PhD in Māori Studies since 2003.<br>Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says getting a degree represents an outstanding achievement.</p>
<p>“Victoria has an established reputation both in New Zealand and internationally for academic excellence and the calibre of its research and postgraduate study—Graduation time is a celebration of that excellence.</p>
<p>“Our graduates have a diverse range of skills and attributes, but above all, Victoria graduates are valued for their skills in communication, creative and critical thinking, and leadership, and they make a valuable contribution to the New Zealand economy and society.</p>

<p>“One such example is one of this Graduation’s honorary doctorates, Dr Ross Ferguson. Since graduating from Victoria with an Honours Degree in Science, Dr Ferguson has gone on to become the international authority on kiwifruit biology and an ambassador for New Zealand science. Projects under his leadership have been fundamental to New Zealand’s kiwifruit breeding programme and to the New Zealand kiwifruit’s expansion to an international market.”</p>
<p>Victoria’s December Graduation will see Honorary Doctorates granted to Dr Ross Ferguson; Dr Jack Richards, a renowned specialist in second and foreign language teaching and Dr Takirirangi Clarence Smith, a tohunga whakairo or master carver in Māori carving.</p>
