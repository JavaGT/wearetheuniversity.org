<p>Nanaia Mahuta<br>Education spokesperson</p>
<p>21 December 2011</p>
<p><strong>National fails to listen to Kawerau</strong></p>
<p>National’s announcement of a new school for Kawerau today is an arrogant dismissal of the community’s parents, teachers and students, says Labour Education spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
<p>“Education Minister Hekia Parata’s excitable announcement today that she was closing Kawerau Intermediate and merging it into Kawerau College makes no mention of the community opposition to this proposal.</p>
<p>“The Minister needs to be working alongside this community not dictating her ideology at them.</p>
<p>“Labour will continue to watch the situation to ensure that learning is being made the priority as the Government and the community work through this issue.</p>
<p>“I would hate to think that the Government is putting ideology above the best interests of the education of children.</p>
<p>“In a community as close knit as Murupara those children deserve the very best options from a public education system. A merger of this scale would need the strong endorsement of the parents and community to ensure success.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately the decision to close the intermediate in direct opposition to the wishes of the community raises questions about whether National is listening at all.</p>
<p>“Hekia Parata said today she had carefully considered the views of the community before making the decision.</p>
<p>“Given she has been the Minister of Education for just a few days, how careful was that consideration?</p>
<p>“The Kawerau Community deserved to be listened to by the new Minister. Labour is listening and we will continue to make the concerns the community heard,” Nanaia Mahuta said.</p>
