<p><strong>Address In Reply</strong></p>
<p>21 December 2011</p>
<p>Mr Speaker,</p>
<p>I acknowledge you, and congratulate you, on your return to the role of Speaker.</p>
<p>I congratulate the two new members of Parliament who moved and seconded the Address in Reply, and I wish them well in this House.</p>
<p>I also want to start by congratulating the new ministers on the Government’s front bench and in Cabinet.</p>
<p>I also want to acknowledge the work of all the Canterbury MPs – including my Labour colleagues – whose efforts in adversity have made us proud.</p>
<p>The devastation in Christchurch demands that this House realize that as New Zealanders we have far more to unite us than to divide us.</p>
<p>We will continue to cast a vigilant eye – but we will always wish the greatest success for the government in its work there.</p>
<p>Just over three weeks ago the National Government and the Labour Opposition put our ideas in front of the people of New Zealand, and our side didn’t win.</p>
<p>And therefore Labour will be different in these coming three years.</p>
<p>We will turn a page.</p>
<p>We have a new, fresh, energized team of which I’m immensely proud.</p>
<p>But I also mean change that’s deeper than these fresh faces on the front bench.</p>
<p>Labour will listen. We will learn. And we will act.</p>
<p>That much I promise you.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that we must earn the right to lead this country in government in 2014.</p>
<p>And that’s exactly what we will do.</p>
<p>To do this we will change our focus and put all our energies into our vision for a New Zealand we can all aspire to.</p>

<p>Labour will support good ideas, wherever they come from.</p>
<p>But, we will not shirk for a moment from doing our job of scrutinizing the government and holding it to account.</p>
<p>We will stand up and fight whenever our Labour values are threatened and I have no doubt that we will have rich pickings over the next three years</p>
<p>But we will be constructive, too.</p>
<p>I reached out to the government on its ministerial committee on poverty because I believe that is a good idea.</p>
<p>The other day a woman came into my office – she was educated and motivated wanting to work. But for a variety of reasons, she’d fallen on tough times.</p>
<p>She came into my office hungry. Hungry. She was forced to swallow her dignity to visit her MP to ask for help.</p>
<p>Everyone else had turned her down – or couldn’t help in time.</p>
<p>This is not what anyone expects in NZ.</p>
<p>The Maori Party is right to force poverty into the Government’s line of sight.</p>
<p>And today I repeat my invitation to the Government: Make that committee a committee of this House.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister should know this is not an issue to play politics over.</p>
<p>I have witnessed horrific poverty, and believe me there is no excuse for poverty here in New Zealand.</p>
<p>So this is a sincere offer and I hope the Government sees fit to revisit its position.</p>
<p>Just as Labour will embrace good ideas when we see them, I urge the Government to do the same.</p>
<p>It&#39;s what New Zealanders want from us.</p>
<p>They showed it by their ringing endorsement of MMP.</p>
<p>It’s also how I have lived my life -finding constructive solutions to difficult problems.</p>
<p>Time and again, New Zealanders have told me they are sick of the petty political points scoring.</p>
<p>New Zealanders want us to get on with solving the very real problems we face:</p>
<p>• Recovering from global financial crisis and the impact on our people, and on our businesses.<br>That’s why we’re here.</p>
<p>• Rebuilding the houses and infrastructure, as well as the dreams and aspirations, for all those who call Canterbury home.<br>That’s what we’re here to do.</p>
<p>• Facing up to environmental threats; and facing up to inequality that’s growing faster here than anywhere in the Western world.<br>That’s the job we’re here for.</p>
<p>• Getting our books back under control.<br>That’s what New Zealand expects of us.</p>
<p>• Tackling the 20,000 teenaged New Zealanders who have left school, and who are not in work, not in training, not anywhere but headed for trouble.<br>That’s why we’re here.</p>
<p>New Zealanders expect us to apply ourselves as a Parliament to making New Zealand a better place to live, work and raise a family.</p>
<p>That&#39;s the deal. That’s why we’re here.</p>
<p>Under my leadership, I can promise you this: Labour will work tirelessly to play its part.</p>
<p>The Labour Party is turning a page.</p>
<p>This Labour Party will put growing the pie for all New Zealanders at the front of our agenda.</p>
<p>We cannot be content dividing an ever shrinking pie. It means growing the nation’s wealth.</p>
<p>Labour will grasp the mantle of economic leadership. We will look to expand opportunity for all New Zealanders, wherever they are born or whoever they are born to.</p>
<p>We must build an economy that produces good jobs and decent incomes.</p>
<p>That generates wealth and opportunity, without sacrificing our natural assets, our lifestyles or our communities.</p>
<p>That’s why I’m taking science and innovation.<br>That’s why I’m giving to our most senior spokespeople:<br>economic development, and small business, and regional development, and skills and training, and also environment and education…all on the front bench.</p>
<p>They’re all part of the same vision - to create the growing New Zealand we want, that will be clean, green and innovative.</p>
<p>Our agriculture and our primary industries are the backbone of our economy, and have been for generations, and will continue to be central.</p>
<p>But we can’t multiply our dairy industry five times or more to catch Australia’s economy.</p>
<p>Nor can we rely on our tourist industry alone.</p>
<p>Yet our economy is slowly declining in relation to others.</p>
<p>Forty years ago meat exports paid our pharmaceutical bill 18 times over – today, it pays for them just seven times over.</p>
<p>But the Government’s strategy goes something like this: as China and Asia grow richer they will demand a higher protein diet.</p>
<p>We grow protein, therefore we’re ideally positioned.</p>
<p>That’s not a strategy. It’s a hope.</p>
<p>It’s a hope that we won’t have to change so that we can keep doing more or less the same thing we’ve done since the 1960s.</p>
<p>I want to unleash New Zealand’s innovation and see New Zealand create global businesses.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I bumped into Sean Simpson a guy who had founded a company called Lanzatech.</p>
<p>It had developed some clever technology to turn waste gas from steel mill smoke stacks into liquid fuel.</p>
<p>The potential is huge.</p>
<p>If China converts just half of its steel mills to use Sean’s technology, it will generate 20% of their liquid fuel needs.</p>
<p>That’s worth billions and it’s a New Zealand company.</p>
<p>And that science and expertise is not just in manufacturing but in agriculture too.</p>
<p>The potential is amongst us. We just don’t recognize it - unlike other countries.</p>
<p>Others countries have made these changes before us.</p>
<p>Less than 20 years ago Finland was in a similar position to ours - a narrowly-based economy, high unemployment, a tanking stock market.</p>
<p>Its economic future was dire.</p>
<p>They elected a new Prime Minister who told them: only the Finnish people could fix their own problems.</p>
<p>Only their brains and talent were going to take them forward.</p>
<p>And from there they set about making change.</p>
<p>They took bold decisions.</p>
<p>They created global, world-beating businesses through their own innovation and talent.</p>
<p>And today they sit near the top of the OECD.</p>
<p>The most important change they made was their attitude.</p>
<p>New Zealand faces a more glacial decline than Finland did, but a decline nevertheless.</p>
<p>And if they can change, so can we.</p>
<p>So the reason I profoundly disagree with this government’s direction is that it is just drifting along.</p>
<p>It’s not creating the clean, green and clever New Zealand I am talking about.</p>
<p>They don’t have good ideas, or a plan for New Zealand.</p>
<p>People have become disillusioned and as a result they are leaving in record numbers for Australia in the last year.</p>
<p>They don’t have a vision for changing New Zealand, or for growing our country, or for investing in our people.</p>
<p>Therefore they end up without the money for services they need and deserve.</p>
<p>National is not fixing our problems.</p>
<p>They’re not creating a New Zealand of the future. Therefore people don’t have decent wages.</p>
<p>One-quarter of those showing up to the Salvation Army for help, have jobs – but their pay is too low.</p>
<p>We have to change.</p>
<p>When two-thirds of all business leaders think this government has no direction, then we know there is something wrong.</p>
<p>We are a proud nation of hard working souls, and we need to shape our own future.<br>I think of those people working really hard. Two jobs, self-employed, often working for around the minimum wage trying to get ahead.</p>
<p>They need our support.</p>
<p>We are an inventive people. We have great ideas. But too often we fail to commercialise them.</p>
<p>Or we sell out to global interests and let overseas investors reap the rewards of our hard work and innovation.</p>
<p>The economy Labour wants to build is going to leverage our global competitive advantages.</p>
<p>It will leverage off our environment – as I have mentioned.</p>
<p>But it also needs to leverage off education. This is an area that I’m particularly passionate about.</p>
<p>We need a school system that gives our children the confidence and skills to be leaders in a new economy.</p>
<p>It’s too easy for a school leaver to drift out of school, and they’re lost.</p>
<p>But we need them.</p>
<p>The pathway between school and tertiary training is broken for too many of our young people and they are falling through the cracks.</p>
<p>A third of our Māori and Pasifika kids – for example – leave school with no qualifications.</p>
<p>Lifting those kids back into training is expensive and takes a huge effort.</p>
<p>We cannot afford them to fail in the first place.</p>
<p>That part of our education system needs an overhaul.</p>
<p>Education is the best plan that exists anywhere in the world to open opportunities and offer new chances.</p>
<p>I want to unleash New Zealand’s innovative drive and determination. To help Kiwi companies make the most of every opportunity to take New Zealand global.</p>
<p>But if we look at the Speech from the Throne - where are the ideas?</p>
<p>There were no ideas to create the smart, innovative and prosperous New Zealand we need.</p>
<p>There were no ideas to keep future generations of Kiwis from simply packing up and taking their skills, qualifications and energy with them.</p>
<p>It turns out that ultimately National&#39;s big idea boils down to these three short words: sell it off.</p>
<p>That’s it. That’s the big idea.</p>
<p>And I say to this House, New Zealanders know in their heart of hearts that “sell it off” is the last resort of a government that has run out of ideas.</p>
<p>We can’t get richer by selling our inheritance.</p>
<p>It only leaves us worse off.</p>
<p>Once they’re gone, they’re gone.</p>
<p>The Government doesn’t even know how much they’re going to get for selling them.</p>
<p>But they are happy to pay a hundred million dollars in fees to foreign advisers helping to sell them.</p>
<p>I can think of much better uses for a hundred million dollars.</p>
<p>Getting more sick kids to the doctor.</p>
<p>Putting new technology and extra teachers in our schools.</p>
<p>More science investment to tackle our agricultural emissions.</p>
<p>Not 100 million for advice on selling the assets.</p>
<p>That’s a terrible plan.</p>
<p>And how much is New Zealand going to get for pushing on with this sell off?</p>
<p>The government says the assets will sell for somewhere between 5 billion dollars and 7 billion dollars.</p>
<p>That’s a $2 billion dollar difference.</p>
<p>That might be chump change for the National Party, but it represents what they’re happy to risk by selling at the bottom of the market.</p>
<p>We’re in the middle of the most unstable global financial conditions since the Great Depression.</p>
<p>None of us here have lived in more threatening economic times internationally.</p>
<p>The economic forecast is dire – and they want to sell off our assets.</p>
<p>Would anyone here sell their house at the bottom of the market?</p>
<p>Before the election they said they would delay the asset sales if the conditions weren’t right.</p>
<p>But the day after Ministers were sworn in, they put Mighty River on the block.</p>
<p>The day after.</p>
<p>The global financial conditions are worse - but they’re plunging ahead anyway.</p>
<p>Selling Mighty River won’t create a cleaner, greener, smarter New Zealand.</p>
<p>It won’t help families and communities.</p>
<p>It won’t help to make a more inclusive New Zealand, or more opportunity.</p>
<p>And that’s why Labour is going to lead the campaign up and down the country against selling out those assets.</p>
<p>The asset sales are just ideology, not the change New Zealand needs.</p>
<p>Not a vision to help 157,000 unemployed New Zealanders into productive employment so they can pay taxes.</p>
<p>And so they can play their full part in their communities.</p>
<p>The Government has no such vision.</p>
<p>On the Treasury’s own figures, more people will be out of work in 2014 than when National took office.</p>
<p>What a searing indictment.</p>
<p>Six years, and unemployment will be up and not down.</p>
<p>More people on the dole, not fewer.</p>
<p>I want to make this clear pledge:</p>
<p>If officials ever presented me with a set of projections that showed unemployment worse in six years - I would change my policies.</p>
<p>Six years and the problem gets worse not better?</p>
<p>That is failure and that is what failure looks like.</p>
<p>That’s a testament to a lack of ideas and a plan.</p>
<p>I want to remind this House of some profound words I heard here recently, about why we are in parliament.</p>
<p>“Once in office, you&#39;ve got to do something. That is why having a plan matters.”</p>
<p>That’s very true advice.</p>
<p>And it came from that side of the House.</p>
<p>It came from Simon Power as he signed off from here.</p>
<p>Those words are – and were – words of warning to that Government.</p>
<p>It’s wrong to just drift along, as this government is doing.</p>
<p>It’s wrong to think you can take New Zealand forward without a vision for the New Zealand you are trying to create.</p>
<p>And therefore Mr Speaker, the Opposition has no confidence in the programme the Government has outlined.</p>
<p>And that’s why I move an amendment as follows:</p>
<p><em>That the following words be added to the Address: “and the National-led Government will sell New Zealand’s assets against the will of the public;</em></p>
<p><em>the Government has no ideas to create jobs or a clean and innovative New Zealand,</em></p>
<p><em>that the Government is widening the gap between the very rich and the rest and therefore this House has no confidence in the National-led government.</em></p>
<p><em>Mr Speaker,</em></p>
<p><em>The National Government used to talk about its aspiration for New Zealand.</em></p>
<p><em>But that aspiration is now frail and feeble, and all but gone.</em></p>
<p><em>Now what they aspire to is a low-wage New Zealand that where there is opportunity for just a few.</em></p>
<p><em>They used to say that our best and brightest would no longer need to leave New Zealand to get ahead.</em></p>
<p><em>But people are leaving faster today than ever before.</em></p>
<p><em>They used to talk about a step-change in the economy.</em></p>
<p><em>But they have taken a step-back and our economy has been downgraded.</em></p>
<p><em>We have never owed more as a country in our history.</em></p>
<p><em>We have never had a government ready to do less and create less.</em></p>
<p><em>But we must change.</em></p>
<p><em>Labour will listen to good ideas.</em></p>
<p><em>We will get behind policies that are right for NZ – no matter who puts them forward.</em></p>
<p><em>We will be constructive but we will oppose with all our energy those policies that will undermine a clean, clever future that will weaken our families and communities.</em></p>
<p><em>New Zealand needs a renewed direction.</em></p>
<p><em>We are all about to go on holiday. I wish you all well.</em></p>
<p><em>Personally, I’ll be spending much of that catching up with people in the pubs, clubs and camping grounds around the country.</em></p>
<p><em>But I’m planning on a few days to head north to a near-deserted beach, for some fishing and surfing.</em></p>
<p><em>Sitting on a board, waiting for that wave, looking down into clear water and back to a white beach, it’s magic.</em></p>
<p><em>These are the experiences that tie us to NZ. We can all think of places that are special to us.</em></p>
<p><em>But a beautiful place isn’t enough to hold our young here. That won’t bring the most talented to live here – just to visit.</em></p>
<p><em>We need innovation, exciting businesses and real opportunities.</em></p>
<p><em>We need reward for hard work and creativity.</em></p>
<p><em>Imagine a NZ that is not only green and unspoiled, but also home to creative ideas and world-leading technology.</em></p>
<p><em>Imagine a New Zealand known the world over for smart thinking and really smart businesses taking the world by storm.</em></p>
<p><em>Imagine a NZ that is compassionate towards those who need a hand up, that is independent and make up its own mind on global issues based on its own values.</em></p>
<p><em>That’s a country I’d love to live in.</em></p>
<p><em>That’s a country I’d love to lead as head of a Labour Government.</em></p>
<p><em>That’s why we need to make change.</em></p>
<p><em>That’s why we need to turn a new page.</em></p>
<p><em>And that’s the change Labour stands for.</em></p>
<p><em>ENDS</em></p>
