<p><strong>EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt. Hon Winston Peters</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leader NZ First</strong></p>
<p>Address: Address In Reply</p>
<p>Date: December 21 2011</p>
<p>Time: 3.45 pm</p>
<p>Venue: Parliament Debating Chamber</p>
<p><strong>“Concoctions and Contradictions”</strong></p>
<p>Mr Speaker,</p>
<p>As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, New Zealand is in economic and social trouble because of its blind adherence to policies that will not work.</p>
<p>First we want to thank the thousands of people who brought New Zealand First back to Parliament.</p>
<p>We didn’t enjoy the massive taxpayer resources or the financial resources of other parties, or indeed the soft media idolatry that was generously conferred on some parties.</p>
<p>However, we were on the receiving end of a seeming blackout, boycott, media embargo that was designed to discredit and diminish us.</p>
<p>We packed hall after hall, which is surely a demonstration of consumer demand, or indeed that there is such a thing as a political market only to find again and again that our message was being spiked.</p>
<p>In short we were blacked out.</p>
<p>That is why I and my colleagues are deeply indebted to the New Zealand people and their sense of fair play.</p>
<p>They knew there was something rotten going on and they were not going to be part of it.</p>
<p>Over the past three years we went the length and breadth of the country.</p>
<p>We spoke to New Zealanders from the deep South to the far North.</p>
<p>We learned their fears, their hopes and their dreams of what they want as the future of their country.</p>

<p>New Zealand First did not rely on focus groups, opinion polls, surveys and profiling to find out what the people were thinking.</p>
<p>We simply went and visited them and listened to them.</p>
<p>That’s why New Zealand First is back here to provide a voice for New Zealanders who believe in the concept of a fair go for everyone.</p>
<p>Our society was built on this ideal.</p>
<p>What we have heard from the National Party again today puts us in mind of a substance that dairy farmers wash off a cowshed floor with a strong hose!</p>
<p>That substance smells like a scented rose compared to the stench of the deals done by the National Party and its hangers-on.</p>
<p>For example.</p>
<p>What happened to one law for all from the Act party?</p>
<p>What happened to no privatisation of water from the United Future party.</p>
<p>What happened to no sale of strategic assets from the Maori Party.</p>
<p>Without these three parties selling out their principles this government has no majority.</p>
<p>But there is some good news -we are back in the nick of time.</p>
<p>And although we are but eight lined up against the faces of irresponsible capitalism remember that in the bold old days a Roman soldier Horatius held the bridge with only two.</p>
<p>On November 6th at Kelston we warned New Zealanders what to expect.</p>
<p>And it’s exactly what has happened.</p>
<p>We set out in a speech the crucial issues that would bring us back to Parliament.</p>
<p>Not one media told the public why we had decided to go into Opposition.</p>
<p>And today from the government you heard all the evidence that New Zealand First had made the right decision.</p>
<p><strong>Whanau Ora</strong></p>
<p>Let’s start with the giant leap into a state of apartheid called whanau ora.</p>
<p>This is National’s billion dollar bribe to the Maori party.</p>
<p>Talk about koha!</p>
<p>The National Party has promised the Maori Party at least one billion dollars of taxpayers’ money to feed the Treaty travellers, corporate Maori and so-called “providers” of Maori services.</p>
<p>Let me tell you exactly what Maori need.</p>
<p>It’s exactly the same as all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>They need jobs with first world wages so they can provide for their families.</p>
<p>They need jobs so they can regain and retain their dignity.</p>
<p>They need warm housing.</p>
<p>They need good healthcare and they need a sound education and training.</p>
<p>This will not be achieved by siphoning a billion dollars to set up separate agencies to deal with these matters separately.</p>
<p>Past governments of all colours worked hard to include Maori and to provide better housing, education, healthcare and employment.</p>
<p>The coalition deal between National and the Maori Party is a document that brings great shame to everyone involved in it.</p>
<p>Listen to this and I quote “ National and the Maori Party agree to support the evolving focus and ongoing implementation of Whanau Ora”.</p>
<p>Evolving focus?</p>
<p>That means making things up as you go along – or another translation thinking up better ideas to get more trotters in the trough.</p>
<p>Then there’s a “stand alone commissioning agency” within twelve months.</p>
<p>This of course is the new Ministry of Apartheid.</p>
<p>But wait, as they say, there’s more.</p>
<p>“Whanau Ora will increasingly bring a greater focus to address the issues of employment, housing, educational achievement and the wellbeing of the most vulnerable ….that is psychobabble.</p>
<p>Let’s repeat it.</p>
<p>Employment?</p>
<p>We thought the Finance Minister announced 171,000 new jobs in the last budget.</p>
<p>Or was that just a fraudulent document?</p>
<p>Now you don’t create more jobs by setting up a separate system – except for the selected Treaty travellers heading for the trough.</p>
<p>In case National and the Maori Party haven’t noticed there are already state agencies that deal with the same matters.</p>
<p>TPK or the Ministry of Maori Development already has an oversight responsibility to ensure various ministries deliver to Maori.</p>
<p>If these ministries are not working to capacity we suggest that Maori should look at the ministers in charge of them.</p>
<p>There’s an old fashioned way of motivating ministers – it’s two words.</p>
<p>One starts with K and the other with A and it usually comes in inverted commas!</p>
<p>We are uniquely qualified in New Zealand First to reveal the expensive separatism hidden in Whanau Ora.</p>
<p>Great New Zealand leaders of the past – both Maori and non- Maori - knew their people.</p>
<p>They built this country.</p>
<p>They worked hard to provide jobs, healthcare, education and housing for everyone.</p>
<p>New Zealanders will never accept the separatism in Whanau Ora.</p>
<p>National was strangely silent about this during the election campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Constitutional Review</strong></p>
<p>And while we are on this coalition agreement let’s look at another outrage – the review of New Zealand’s constitutional arrangements.</p>
<p>We warned about this too – and everyone was silent.</p>
<p>National and the Maori Party are going to progress the review of New Zealand’s constitutional arrangements with the Treaty of Waitangi as its cornerstone.</p>
<p>What about the four million plus other New Zealanders who live here?</p>
<p>The democratic rights and the governance of New Zealanders are being traded between National and the Maori Party like junk bonds on Wall Street.</p>
<p>People have died for the cause of democracy.</p>
<p>This country has a history of fighting the forces of fascism, Nazism and communism.</p>
<p>Nobody gave National and the Maori Party the right to meddle with our constitutional arrangements.</p>
<p>We will do everything in our power to stop this.</p>
<p>And now, let’s look at the detail or rather the lack of it.</p>
<p>Where’s the money coming from for these deals?</p>
<p>We know it’s being siphoned off other government spending.</p>
<p>Who is missing out? Where is the billion dollars coming from?</p>
<p>Don’t tell us you’re going to sell power stations and lakes and rivers to fund Whanau Ora!</p>
<p>Or is this what the government is doing?</p>
<p><strong>State Assets</strong></p>
<p>The prime minister this year has so far given three separate reasons for privatising state assets.</p>
<p>First - he was going to repay debt. Then someone reminded him that private debt is the problem, so second - he said he was going to sell state assets to buy other state assets.</p>
<p>Next – third - he said he was going to spend the power stations’ sales monies on schools and hospitals – apparently these were the new state assets.</p>
<p>But they don’t make a return.</p>
<p>When that went down like a lead balloon he’s back reinvesting the money in new investments.</p>
<p>There is going to be a ten percent cap on share ownership.</p>
<p>So pray tell us how does this work?</p>
<p>We’re just trying to think of a New Zealand Mum and Dad who can afford ten percent of Mighty River.</p>
<p>This is simply more deception.</p>
<p>Mighty River Power is a jewel in the Crown of state assets.</p>
<p>Why sell it? We all know it will end up in the hands of a foreign company.</p>
<p>This is what happens when a cabinet of wheeler dealers take over.</p>
<p>They are fully applying the principles of irresponsible capitalism taught by the Wall Street traders.</p>
<p>Except that principles of course have nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>This is what they firmly believe in.</p>
<p>You capitalise your profits and you socialise your losses.</p>
<p>Just look at the dog of an insurance company called AMI.</p>
<p>The boss got paid a million dollars last year.</p>
<p>But when the time came to pay insurance claims he went bleating to the government.</p>
<p>Now the good part of AMI – the customer base – is being sold to a foreign insurance company.</p>
<p>The bad part – hundreds of millions of debt is being met by the New Zealand taxpayers.</p>
<p>And South Canterbury Finance – which is now a state funded benefit for lawyers, consultants and managers.</p>
<p>At last count it was about a billion and a half – and still climbing.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker the government’s plans outlined in the speech from the throne today are a concoction of backroom deals and contradictions.</p>
<p>It doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>The government has an extraordinary plan to cut jobs by reducing spending while at the same time demanding that unemployed people go back to work.</p>
<p>Someone should have told the National Party and its hangers-on that it is physically and financially impossible to cut jobs and create them at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Charter Schools</strong></p>
<p>Now - on the subject of charter schools, the government is simply privatising under-achievement and failure.</p>
<p>The state is obliged to educate New Zealand children.</p>
<p>The government must look within the Education Ministry ranks for solutions to its educational failures.</p>
<p>Charter schools are for private organisations to make money. It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>Free Trade</strong></p>
<p>And once again trade deals!</p>
<p>When will they ever learn?</p>
<p>These “high quality” trade agreements are simply licences for job losses.</p>
<p>How many times must we get into free trade agreements that massively benefit the other parties before we finally wake up?”</p>
<p>The government’s plan as outlined today will not improve New Zealand socially or economically.</p>
<p>We will eventually lose our valuable power stations and other state assets and most people will be much the poorer.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker we’re back in the nick of time.</p>
<p>This government did not get a mandate either on election day or after it to sell valuable state assets to their mates.</p>
<p>We intend to remind New Zealanders every day for the next three years what three of the four parties who make up this government actually campaigned on.</p>
<p>We intend to tell people who conspire against New Zealand’s interests that there’s will be a short term investment and that after 2014 – or earlier – we’ll have a mandate to take these assets back.</p>
<p>We want to make it very clear to some people in this country that since 1854 we’ve held elections every three years – in peace or war.</p>
<p>That’s because New Zealand is one of the world’s great democracies.</p>
<p>We in New Zealand First know that Parliament has real power and so does Opposition.</p>
<p>We are here to propose good policies and oppose bad policies and that is exactly what we are going to do.</p>
<p>That is what New Zealanders are paying us to do.</p>
<p>Let us finish with a brief quote that explains exactly what is wrong with concepts of freedom and democracy in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Listen to this quote from a newspaper “The new government has a job to do. It is in no ones’ interests for it to be diverted by politics.”</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen this is not North Korea. This is not a one party state.</p>
<p>Be warned.</p>
