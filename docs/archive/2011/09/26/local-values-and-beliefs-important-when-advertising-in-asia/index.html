<p>Local values and religious beliefs important when advertising in Asia</p>
<p>Effective marketing to Asia requires advertising that is tailored to each individual country rather than a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach, according to the research findings of Victoria University’s Professor of Marketing Kim Fam.</p>
<p>“Asia is a continent of paradoxes,” says Professor Fam.</p>
<p>“It has some of the fastest growing economies of the world, as well as some of the largest populations—and is made up of a rich web of cultural complexities.</p>
<p>“Advertisers need to have a deep understanding of the culture of each Asian country they market to, keeping in mind local values and religious beliefs.”</p>
<p>In his upcoming inaugural Professorial lecture on 4 October, titled ‘Chopsticks advertising—the art of marketing to Asia’, Professor Fam will explain the concept of chopsticks advertising.</p>
<p>“To get all the rice in your mouth without dropping any you need to be able to use both chopsticks skilfully. Just using one chopstick is essentially useless. This is the same as the relationship between advertisers and consumers—if the advertiser doesn’t understand the consumers they are marketing to, their money will be wasted.</p>
<p>“On the surface, chopsticks seem to be a simple tool, but they have their own complexities. The Chinese, for instance, use long wooden sets with a rounder thicker end, the Japanese use short wooden chopsticks that come to a shorter pointy end, and the Koreans most commonly use metallic chopsticks.”</p>

<p>Taking the analogy further, Professor Fam says that different rules of etiquette apply in each country as well—for instance in Chinese culture, chopsticks should not be left vertically stuck into a bowl of rice because it resembles the ritual of incense-burning that symbolises ‘feeding’ the dead, and in Vietnamese culture chopsticks placed in a ‘v’ shape after eating are interpreted as a bad omen.</p>
<p>An example that applies to the theory of chopsticks advertising is the marketing of ‘controversial products’ such as underwear, condoms and female hygiene products.</p>
<p>“Muslims find the advertising of many of these types of products offensive, so in Muslim countries advertising late at night, on the internet, texting or direct marketing are more appropriate channels. Also, female models need to be well covered up.</p>
<p>“However, in Thailand, for example, sex sells, and advertising featuring a scantily clad model is culturally acceptable.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes it’s not enough simply to understand religious values as contextual factors can also play a big part. For instance, Malaysia and Turkey are both Islamic countries, but Malaysia is more lenient when it comes to advertising alcohol. This is because Malaysia is a multicultural country which needs to maintain social and cultural harmony with its various ethnic groups, including Malay, Chinese and Indian.”</p>
<p>Professor Fam says it is important to realise that cultural sensitivity is not merely about understanding what causes offense. It entails identifying and understanding local customs, traditions, values and consumer behaviour.</p>
<p>“Marketers need to work with local government officials, religious bodies, and suppliers and distributors to ensure their advertising is appropriate for their target market.”</p>
<p>Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Walsh says Victoria’s Inaugural Lecture series is an opportunity for professors to provide family, friends, colleagues and the wider community with an insight into their specialist area of study.</p>
<p>“It is also an opportunity for the University to celebrate and acknowledge our valued professors,” says Professor Walsh.</p>
<p>Professor Kim Fam’s inaugural lecture will be held on Tuesday 4 October at 6pm at Victoria University’s Hunter Council Chamber, Level 2, Hunter Building, Gate 1 or 2, Kelburn Parade, Wellington.</p>
