<p>MEDIA RELEASE – 26/9/11</p>
<p>Cannabis – low/moderate risk to public health</p>
<p>A response to Don Brash’s statement in the media that cannabis is safe and should be legalised</p>
<p>“We welcome Don Brash’s call for a change in our cannabis laws” said Professor Doug Sellman, Director of the National Addiction Centre, “but no psychoactive recreational drug is completely safe.”</p>
<p>“We should be talking in terms of levels of risk rather than categorical safety or not”</p>
<p>“Compared with alcohol, which has been demonstrated to be a Class B equivalent drug ie high risk to public health, cannabis is estimated to be of low/moderate risk to public health”.</p>
<p>“There are four main risks associated with frequent heavy cannabis use as follows:</p>
<p>1. chronic respiratory illness, including lung cancer associated with smoking the drug;</p>
<p>2. injury and death from driving under the influence of cannabis, but less than with alcohol intoxication;</p>
<p>3. increased psychotic symptoms, which is clinically relevant in less than 1% of the population; and</p>
<p>4. a negative impact on learning, particularly relevant for adolescents who are at that critical stage of life when both formal school education as well as complex social learning set a life course for the individual within society.”</p>
<p>“Low-risk cannabis use for adults, which is using cannabis at a level associated with a one in a hundred chance of dying from a cannabis-related event has never been scientifically validated as far as I know”, said Prof Sellman. “This is one of the problems of having the drug prohibited and yet used by thousands of New Zealanders on a relatively frequent basis”.</p>

<p>“However, an educated guess based on low-risk tobacco smoking and low-risk drinking guidelines can be made; everything else being equal, it would probably be smoking cannabis about once a week or less”.</p>
<p>“The recent Law Commission Review of the Misuse of Drugs Act has encouraged public discussion about drugs from a health perspective rather than just as a criminal justice issue, and to use scientific evidence to guide policy making rather than perpetuating drug use as a moral issue”.</p>
