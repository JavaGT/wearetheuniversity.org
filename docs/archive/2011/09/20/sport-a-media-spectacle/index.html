<p><strong>Tuesday, 20 September 2011, 2:58 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sport a media spectacle</strong></p>
<p>Media hype around big sporting events draws the crowds says a Victoria University researcher, but too much of it could turn events like Rugby World Cup games into a circus.</p>
<p>Associate Professor of Media Studies Tony Schirato says it is television and – increasingly – the Internet that allow big numbers to follow major games and give sponsors the returns they want.<br>But he says it’s risky for sport to be so reliant on the media.</p>
<p>“What people traditionally value in sport are things like loyalty, performance, beauty and ethics. There’ll be much less of that on show if tournaments become primarily spectator events.</p>
<p>“And there is also a danger that the real fans who love the sport, as opposed to those who are following it because it’s fashionable, will feel disenfranchised.”</p>
<p>He says it’s a delicate balance between ensuring sport is interesting and appealing to a wide audience and turning it into a reality TV show that kills the essence of what people love about sport and sporting heroes.</p>
<p>“We are witnessing sport at a very crucial stage in history.”</p>
<p>Dr Schirato says the Rugby Sevens held annually in Wellington is a graphic example of how the media is changing sport.</p>
<p>“The cameras are often on the spectators and their costumes. Every now and then they switch to the game but the rugby almost takes a back seat.”</p>
<p>He says the opening night of the Rugby World Cup in Auckland was a similar phenomenon.</p>
<p>“Because of its amateur background, rugby came to this a bit later but we’re now seeing the media spectacle fully integrated into the game.”</p>

<p>Dr Schirato says codes that aren’t suited to being a sporting spectacle are declining while others that make good television are growing in popularity.</p>
<p>“The Indian Premier League for cricket is a classic example of a tournament organised primarily with television audiences in mind.</p>
<p>“Having just 20 overs keeps the game fast, which suits television. The organisers hire crowds by giving free tickets away to people who, in return, agree to create an exciting, colourful and passionate atmosphere at the venue because that makes for more compelling viewing.”</p>
<p>The NFL (National Football League) in the United States is another competition which has “rhythms and rules almost entirely tied up with commercial imperatives”.</p>
<p>And Dr Schirato believes the tennis star Serena Williams would have received a much heavier penalty for her recent abuse of an umpire if it weren’t for the commercial consequences of banning her from the game.</p>
<p>Australian-born Dr Schirato once intended to be a professional sports player but decided instead to put his love of sport into understanding its place in modern life.</p>
<p>In 2007, he published <em>Understanding Sport Culture</em> and is now researching a book on the language of sport.</p>
<p>“The media used to use phrases like fair play and team work on and off the field when describing sport. These days we are more likely to hear about sport being a business and players having a bad day at the office. Commercial language has come to dominate.”</p>
