<p><strong>Tuesday, 20 September 2011, 10:30 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Key can&#39;t have a bob each way on Canterbury</p>
<p>John Key can&#39;t have it both ways when it comes to getting the Canterbury recovery going, says Labour Leader Phil Goff.</p>
<p>&quot;On one hand, John Key claims it would be like &quot;writing a blank cheque&quot; if Labour stepped into the insurance market on a short-term basis to get the rebuild going. But if his Government did it, it would be okay,&quot; said Phil Goff.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s not leadership. It&#39;s called having a bob each way. These are extraordinary times for Canterbury. It&#39;s not business as usual. Cantabrians need decisions they can count on.</p>
<p>&quot;It is nonsense for John Key to condemn Labour for intervening, when he is not ruling out making exactly the same decision. His Minister Gerry Brownlee has already said his Government will consider becoming the insurer of last resort.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cantabrians have told us that progress is being stalled by unavailability of insurance. They&#39;re being asked to put their lives on hold,&quot; said Labour&#39;s Earthquake Recovery Spokesman Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
<p>&quot;They need to be able to get on with rebuilding their lives, homes and businesses. Labour will step in and take an active role to ensure that happens.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course our preference is for insurers to come to the party. We will work with them to resolve the stand-off. It&#39;s not good enough for them to reap the financial benefits during the good times and then head for the hills when times get tough.</p>
<p>&quot;But if it comes to the crunch, we will step in on a short-term basis to get the insurance market functioning again,&quot; said Clayton Cosgrove.</p>

<p>&quot;National has made many promises to Cantabrians that it has failed to keep. Gerry Brownlee told homeowners they&#39;d be able to claim compensation for home improvements and then reneged on that. He repeatedly told homeowners their equity would be preserved. He&#39;s broken that promise too. Cantabrians need certainty. Not a trail of broken promises.</p>
<p>&quot;Recovery comes at a cost. But we cannot ignore the importance of Canterbury to the country as a whole. We cannot afford to do nothing.&quot;</p>
