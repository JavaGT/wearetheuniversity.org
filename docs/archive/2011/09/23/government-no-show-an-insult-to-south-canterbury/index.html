<p>Government no-show an insult to South Canterbury</p>
<p>The no-show by the Government at a public meeting in Temuka last night was an insult to the local communities, says Labour&#39;s Health spokesperson Grant Robertson.</p>
<p>Mr Robertson was the only MP at the meeting, called to discuss the loss of after-hours GP services in Temuka and Geraldine.</p>
<p>&quot;Locals that I spoke to at the meeting are angry that they have lost these important services, and they are looking for leadership to find a solution,&quot; Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is disrespectful - and basic bad manners - that neither the Minister of Health nor any Government MP was there to hear the concerns and provide some much needed support to reinstating the services.</p>
<p>&quot;These communities have been without their after-hours service since the middle of August.</p>
<p>&quot;As has been pointed out this is a disaster waiting to happen. These are rural communities that include both young families and an ageing population. Their need for an accessible and affordable after-hours service is as great as, if not more so than some urban areas.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment there are no negotiations under way to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>I have urged the District Health Board to get back to good faith negotiations to restore the service. They and the doctors need to show leadership.</p>
<p>&quot;As does the Minister. It is simply not good enough for him to stand on the sidelines. He was happy to trumpet the new after-hours services in Auckland, but was conspicuous by his absence here.</p>
<p>&quot;The people of Temuka and Geraldine deserve better,&quot; Grant Robertson said.</p>
