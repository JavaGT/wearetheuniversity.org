<p>UC first NZ university to receive international 5-star rating in new QS Stars system</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury announced today that it is the first New Zealand university to receive a 5-star rating in the newly-established international QS Stars rating system.</p>
<p>A 5-star rating is the highest rating available in the new system which evaluates universities against eight criteria including research quality, teaching quality and graduate employability.</p>
<p>The QS Stars rating system is a global rating system for universities that is administered by the same organisation that delivers the QS World University Rankings. Universities must meet minimum thresholds in a variety of areas to earn ratings ranging from one to five.</p>
<p>According to QS Stars, a university that achieves a 5-star rating &quot;will often be world-class in a broad range of areas, has cutting-edge facilities, and is internationally renowned for its research and teaching faculty&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We are delighted that the University of Canterbury has achieved the highest possible rating in the relatively new QS Stars rating system,&quot; said University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr. &quot;This affirms the University&#39;s position as being amongst the best universities in the world and underlines the fact that UC continues to provide a world-class learning environment.&quot; *</p>
<p>A key criterion on which universities are judged is what is referred to as their “third mission”. QS Stars describes this as &quot;how seriously the university takes its obligations to society by investing in the local community, and providing access through scholarships and bursaries&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;The University of Canterbury takes its &#39;third mission&#39; responsibilities seriously,&quot; said Dr Carr, &quot;and this has been reflected in our 5-star rating. We have substantially increased funding for our scholarships offer for next year and I strongly encourage all prospective and existing UC students to find out more about our scholarships for 2012 and beyond.</p>
<p>&quot;Students, their parents and the wider community are also very welcome to attend our Community Open Day on 1 October from 10am to 3pm. This is a great opportunity to see why UC has achieved its 5-star rating in QS Stars and to find out more about enrolling at our highly-regarded university.&quot;</p>
