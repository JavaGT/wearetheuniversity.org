<p><strong>Monday, 19 September 2011, 11:09 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Leadership needed to rebuild Canterbury</p>
<p>The next Labour Government will intervene to give Cantabrians affordable choices to help rebuild their homes, businesses and lives after the devastating earthquakes, says Labour Leader Phil Goff.</p>
<p>Phil Goff today released Labour&#39;s Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Package.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything in this package is designed to kick-start the rebuild and give residents and businesses the certainty they need to get the Canterbury region and economy moving again.</p>
<p>&quot;These are extraordinary times for Canterbury and the Government must respond accordingly. Business as usual won&#39;t cut it.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the Government needs to take a more active role in the rebuild. A year on from the first quake, Cantabrians are saying that not enough progress has been made. Canterbury needs leadership, transparency and accountability. This policy provides that.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is not prepared to sit back and leave the recovery to market forces We will act decisively.&quot;</p>
<p>Labour will:</p>
<p>* Acquire 1500 sections and on-sell them at cost to Red Zone residents</p>
<p>* Ring-fence a maximum of $100 million from the Canterbury Earthquake Fund to ensure home improvements to houses in the Red Zone are reimbursed up to a maximum of $50,000</p>
<p>* Resolve the insurance standoff and, as a last resort, be prepared to intervene in the insurance market on a short-term basis to get the market functioning again</p>
<p>* Establish an independent insurance commissioner to protect consumers and resolve disputes</p>

<p>* Immediately release all geotechnical information with a plain English guide</p>
<p>* Take action to fill critical skilled worker shortages, firstly from within Christchurch and New Zealand, and provide training - including converting dole payments to apprenticeship subsidies</p>
<p>&quot;Recovery comes at a cost. Government spending is ballooning but progress has stalled. Canterbury is too important to let this happen. Our policy gives people affordable choices and ownership of their future, said Phil Goff.</p>
<p>&quot;This isn&#39;t about writing blank cheques. Our plan is realistic and necessary. We can&#39;t fix every problem but we can improve the outcomes for Cantabrians because we&#39;ll get involved and make things happen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The National Government has set aside $5.5 billion for the Canterbury Recovery Fund. As part of this, they say the net cost of purchase of Red Zone properties will be $485-$635m,&quot; said Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
<p>&quot;Under Labour&#39;s plan to acquire 1500 sections, the cost of buying and readying the land for rebuilding will be recovered when it is on-sold to Red Zone residents who have been paid out from the Canterbury Recovery Fund.</p>
<p>&quot;We will do this at cost to keep the price low so as many residents as possible can make a fresh start without suffering extreme financial hardship.</p>
<p>&quot;It is expected our plan will act as a signal to the market and help keep property prices reasonable in other areas.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not rule out using the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act to purchase land in the face of any evidence of price gouging by developers if that is needed to ensure a fair price is sought and paid.&quot;</p>
<p>Phil Goff says residents will be given access to affordable properties but may still have to contribute over and above the government pay out.</p>
<p>&quot;We can&#39;t promise no one will lose out but we believe that our plan will mean losses won&#39;t be as large as under National&#39;s scheme,&quot; said Phil Goff.</p>
<p>&quot;In extraordinary circumstances people need strong leadership from Government. Labour will provide that leadership and take the action needed to help Canterbury recover.&quot;</p>
