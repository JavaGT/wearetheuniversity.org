<p><strong>Research into Warriors off-pitch contribution</strong></p>
<p>As the Vodafone Warriors prepare for this weekend’s NRL Grand Final, a Massey University researcher is assessing how much of an impact they are making off the field.</p>
<p>Dr Rochelle Stewart-Withers is carrying out research into the rugby league team’s <em>One Community</em> programme, which aims to use the power and profile of the players as positive role models to tackle social issues at grassroots level.</p>
<p>She is involved in an on-going study, in partnership with the Vodafone Warriors, to measure the impact of the programme. Its key areas include addressing bullying and literacy, as well as promoting healthy and active lifestyles.</p>
<p>Dr Stewart-Withers, of the School of People, Environment and Planning, says there is anecdotal evidence that the community development programmes are working but they are now looking to measure the difference they make.</p>
<p>“It is really important that we understand the role of elite sport stars in community development work looking at what the limitations and contributions may be,” she says.</p>
<p>“Stakeholders and recipients of community development programmes also want to be sure outside of the rhetoric of corporate social responsibility that what they say they are doing is done and makes a difference.”</p>
<p>She is working closely with <em>One Community</em> programme manager Petrece Kesha and players including Manu Vatuvei, Aaron Heremaia, Michael Luck, Jerome Ropati and Lance Hohaia.</p>

<p>Dr Stewart-Withers says while the Vodafone Warriors are first and foremost about rugby league and run as a business, engagement at grassroots level to improve social outcomes is seen to be very important.</p>
<p>“In the world of business, ideas around corporate social responsibility are really coming to the fore. It is now well recognised that businesses have a responsibility that goes beyond profit maximisation and we are seeing more and more commercial organisations dedicating resources to corporate social responsibility.”</p>
<p>Dr Stewart-Withers, who is based on the Manawatu campus, has strong research interests in rugby as a vehicle for development and how sport can bring opportunities to address economic and social issues, particularly in low income communities and countries such as Fiji and Papua New Guinea.</p>
