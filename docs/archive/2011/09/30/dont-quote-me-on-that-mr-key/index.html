<p>Brendon<br>BURNS<br>Water Spokesperson</p>
<p>30 September 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Don’t quote me on that, Mr Key</strong>  </p>
<p>More water has been poured on the Prime Minister’s overly glowing view of New Zealand’s 100% Pure image with a challenge in the House this week over his selective use of quotes.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister’s eagerness to accentuate the positive while overlooking the truth is becoming an embarrassment,” Labour’s Water Spokesperson Brendon Burns said.</p>
<p>“He put his foot in it earlier this year during BBC’s <em>Hardtalk</em> show when he claimed New Zealand’s water quality was 100% pure compared to other countries and suggested the negative views of one expert scientist could always be counted by another scientist with a different take on things.</p>
<p>“Challenged in the House about that theory at the time, John Key then quoted Lincoln University’s Professor Ken Hughey saying the ‘perceived state of NZ freshwater is good – a view supported by science’.</p>
<p>“However the quote from Professor Hughey, which I tabled in the House this week, actually concludes ‘…lowland streams not so good; farming issues increasingly seen as a major cause of damage; management improving but issues around farm run-off’,” Brendon Burns said.</p>
<p>“Mr Key has been economical with the truth. Not only did he use only half a quote, but the document he quoted from was a survey of people’s views on water quality, not an actual scientific assessment.</p>

<p>“There is mounting evidence - from the OECD, water scientists, environmentalists and the Auditor-General - that water quality is getting worse, with little prospect of improvement while National’s pro-growth strategy continues.</p>
<p>“Pretending it is not happening – as reputable scientists have consistently warned not to do - won’t make it go away,” Brendon Burns said.</p>
