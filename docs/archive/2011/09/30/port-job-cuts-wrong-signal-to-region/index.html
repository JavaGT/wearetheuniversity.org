<p>Clare<br>CURRAN<br>MP for Dunedin South</p>
<p>30 September 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Port job cuts wrong signal to region</strong></p>
<p>The job cuts announced today by Port Otago are another body blow to our region, Labour’s Dunedin South MP Clare Curran says.</p>
<p>“I understand that the jobs are being axed because management expects a decline in container numbers due to Port Otago no longer being the trans-shipment hub for shipping from Maersk.</p>
<p>“However at the same time the Port has delivered a record $12.5 million dividend this financial year and there’s been an increase in commodities such as logs and milk powder through the port.</p>
<p>“Surely this decision could have been averted. Instead 12 skilled workers will be lost to the dole queues which will undoubtedly have a flow-on effect on the wider Dunedin economy.” Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>“This city needs to work together and come up with solutions to grow industries and jobs, and move forward rather than continue to slide backwards.</p>
<p>“Dunedin and Otago urgently need an economic strategy that the whole city can buy into and get behind. The city’s leaders need to work together and commit to it.</p>
<p>“We have seen 44 highly skilled jobs go from Hillside in the last few months, more people are joining the dole queues or heading out of Dunedin and offshore. I want this city to move ahead and thrive, not to shrink.</p>
<p>“In the absence of a regional growth strategy from the National Government we need to take charge of our own region and work together. I am committed to doing that and ask Port Otago to buy into it too.” Clare Curran said.</p>
