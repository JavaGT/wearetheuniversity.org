<p>University of Canterbury launches 2012 UC Guarantee</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury has announced the launch of its 2012 UC Guarantee.</p>
<p>Under the UC Guarantee students who are new to the University and who achieve merit or excellence endorsements at Level 2 or Level 3 in NCEA or its equivalent* are guaranteed to be eligible for scholarship funding and are guaranteed an offer of accommodation at UC.**</p>
<p>Students who receive an endorsement will automatically get a scholarship once their enrolment at UC is confirmed.</p>
<p>&quot;An unlimited number of scholarships are available for new students who meet UC&#39;s criteria for its new Undergraduate Entrance Scholarships,&quot; said University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr. &quot;The scholarships are valued between $1000 and $3000.&quot;</p>
<p>The University&#39;s halls of residence offer accommodation options from fully-catered halls to self-catered apartment-style living.</p>
<p>&quot;The halls of residence offer a safe and supportive environment for living and study and are only a few minute&#39;s walk from our leafy campus. While we cannot guarantee students the hall of their choice we can guarantee them a place in a hall.</p>
<p>&quot;Enrolments at UC open on Tuesday 4 October. We look forward to welcoming new and returning students to our great learning environment in 2012 and encourage all students who are new to UC to take advantage of the 2012 UC Guarantee.&quot;</p>
<p>Applications for a place in one of UC&#39;s halls remain open. Visit <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz">www.canterbury.ac.nz</a> for more information, to submit an application or to arrange a campus tour.</p>
