<p>Lincoln Uni report shows widespread support for irrigation charge</p>
<p>An extensive new Lincoln University study has found that water pollution is rated by New Zealanders as the most important issue facing our country and that New Zealanders want solutions that include stronger regulation of polluters and a price on the use of irrigation water.</p>
<p>“The study shows that water pollution is rated as the most important environmental issue facing New Zealand and nearly 100 percent of New Zealanders want rivers and lakes that are clean enough to swim in,” said Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman.</p>
<p>The Public Perceptions of New Zealand’s Environment 2010 study, which surveyed over 2000 people, states: “It is clear that New Zealanders have a very high desire for a future of largely non-polluted freshwaters, fit for swimming and with abundant aquatic life. They want the most important rivers protected and they do not want to trade off environmental protection for economic growth.”</p>
<p>Dr Norman said, “New Zealanders value freshwater for nature, scenic, recreational, and community values above commercial interests, yet the Government has ignored these values and has adopted the opposite priorities.</p>
<p>“The Government is determined at all costs to develop water commercially. They sacked all the regional councillors in Canterbury because the Council was slow to consent irrigation schemes and allow the expansion of dairying in the region.</p>
<p>“The Government is out of step with the values of New Zealanders alleging we can have more cows and cleaner rivers when scientists have shown it is a trade-off.</p>

<p>“We have a freshwater crisis on our hands. Over half of our monitored rivers are unsafe for swimming, one third of our lakes are unhealthy, and two-thirds of our native freshwater fish are threatened or at risk of extinction.</p>
<p>“The study shows that New Zealanders love our rivers and lakes and want to protect them with effective management solutions, not just voluntary approaches,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>According to the Lincoln study, New Zealanders favour integrated approaches for freshwater management which combine economic, regulatory, and voluntary instruments. Consistent with this, New Zealanders, including farmers, are strongly supportive of commercial users being charged for the water they use.</p>
<p>“The OECD recently recommended that New Zealand implement a charge for the commercial use of water. Now this study is evidence of strong public support from both farmers and non-farmers. Why is the Government still waiting?” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“Introducing a fair charge for irrigation water is part of the Green Party plan to make our rivers and lakes clean enough to swim in again.</p>
<p>“Our plan also includes setting standards for clean water and supporting water clean-up initiatives.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders want a charge for irrigation water, not further Government inaction,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>Highlights of the study:</p>
<p>· “Water pollution and water related issues were rated as the most important environmental issue facing New Zealand.” (p. III)</p>
<p>· “It is clear that New Zealanders have a very high desire for a future of largely non-polluted freshwaters, fit for swimming and with abundant aquatic life. They want the most important rivers protected and they do not want to trade off environmental protection for economic growth.” (p. 71)</p>
<p>· “Respondents clearly support futures with largely unpolluted waters that are swimmable – they will not accept the loss of native species and clearly do not believe the main emphasis of freshwater management should be economic.” (p. 68)</p>
<p>· “Respondents disagree strongly with the proposition that ‘we should accept some reduction in environmental values of some freshwater resources in order to enhance economic benefits from their use.” (p. 68)</p>
<p>· “For all three types of water body [rivers &amp; streams, lakes, aquifers] nature, scenic, recreational and community values outrank commercial interests which, in turn, outrank Customary Maori values.” (p. 68)</p>
<p>· “Respondents favour integrated approaches which combine economic, regulatory and voluntary instruments, while in a complementary way they are strongly supportive of charging for the commercial use of freshwater.” (p. III)</p>
<p>· “It is clear that respondents support commercial user pays regimes and limited analysis against some key demographics showed no significant difference between farmers and other occupational classes. Respondents all want commercial water use to be monitored, they all want administrative costs charged to commercial users, and in addition they are all strongly supportive of commercial users being charged for the water they use.” (p. 71)</p>
<p>· 52 percent of respondents perceived farming to be the main cause of damage to fresh waters. (p. 17)</p>
