<p>The Auckland Region is in the midst of a Measles outbreak. You may have read in the media that there has been a increased number of Measles cases and the University has been alerted to two confirmed cases within its community which are being managed at a local level.</p>
<p>We would ask you to take a moment to read the attached fact sheets produced from the Auckland Regional Public Health Service regarding prevention, signs and symptoms and management if you have contracted measles.</p>
<p>Measles is highly infectious and therefore is able transmit through the air via an infectious person coughing and sneezing. It is a serious viral disease, however can be prevented by immunisation. If you are unsure if you have been previously immunised check with your parents whether you were immunised as a child, or had measles in the past. If you are still in doubt you should contact your doctor to ascertain whether you need immunisation.</p>
<p>If you believe you have signs and symptoms of Measles please contact your doctor by phone first and alert them to a possible infection before going directly to their clinic. This will prevent transmission to others.</p>
<p>Please remain at home and do not come to work or attend classes until you are cleared fit and not infectious.</p>
