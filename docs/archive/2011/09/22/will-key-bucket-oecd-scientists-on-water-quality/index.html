<p><strong>Brendon BURNS<br>Water Spokesperson</strong></p>
<p>22 September 2011<br><strong>Will Key bucket OECD scientists on water quality?</strong><br>Further international commentary that New Zealand’s water quality is continuing to deteriorate deserves a response from Prime Minister John Key, says Labour’s Water spokesperson Brendon Burns says.</p>
<p>OECD water quality expert Dr Kevin Parris said today that while New Zealand’s water quality was generally good it was deteriorating, in large part due to pollution from intensifying agriculture. One measure of this was that in the rest of the OECD, nitrogen per hectare had dropped 15kgs since 2000, but in New Zealand it has gone up 10 kgs.</p>
<p>“When the Prime Minister John Key was previously challenged on the state of New Zealand’s water quality on the BBC Hardtalk programme, which quoted Dr Mike Joy of Massey University, he simply bucketed the research” Brendon Burns said.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister stated that was just the opinion of one scientist and that if you asked another scientist you would get a completely different opinion.</p>
<p>“Now, as the evidence begins to mount from home and abroad that New Zealand’s water quality needs urgent intervention, will the Prime Minister continue to dismiss the scientists?</p>
<p>“Under the National Government New Zealand’s water quality continues to deteriorate because of its laissez-faire attitude to improving environmental outcomes, as evidenced by it gutting the National Policy Statement on Freshwater Management received from its own consultative body, the Land and Water Forum.</p>
<p>“Perhaps Mr Key would now like to say whether the OECD’ s analysis is accurate or will he bucket this, like he has done with other scientists’ findings,” Brendon Burns said.</p>
