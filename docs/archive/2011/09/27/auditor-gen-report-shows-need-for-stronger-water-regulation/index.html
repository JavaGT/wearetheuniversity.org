<p><strong>Auditor-General report shows need for stronger water regulation</strong></p>
<p>A report by the Office of the Auditor-General highlights the need for strong national direction to clean up our freshwater, direction which the Government has so-far failed to provide, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>“Regional councils have failed to control diffuse sources of pollution and we desperately need regulation to get on top of the problem,” said Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman.</p>
<p>“Currently only one of the four regional councils reviewed by the Auditor-General has the ability to regulate to control all pollution coming off farms. Without this ability, how are councils supposed to halt and reverse the declining trend in freshwater quality?</p>
<p>“The strong draft National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management would have empowered regional councils to require resource consents for land-use intensification, the main source of water quality decline in New Zealand, but the Government watered it down,” Dr Norman said.</p>
<p>Dr Norman agreed with the Office of the Auditor-General that councillors have exerted undue influence in decisions to prosecute breaches of freshwater rules and resource consents.</p>
<p>“Academic work in 2006 showed that farmers, who comprised less than 1 percent of New Zealanders, comprised 38 percent of all regional councillors, and formed a majority on 5 of the 12 regional councils. We need strong national regulation to ensure that farming interests don’t win out over public values for freshwater,” Dr Norman said.</p>

<p>Dr Norman said the Green Party had a strong plan to make New Zealand rivers and lakes clean enough to swim in again. The plan has three elements 1) Set standards for clean water; 2) Introduce a fair charge for irrigation water; and 3) Support water clean-up initiatives.</p>
<p>“This plan will empower regional councils to halt and reverse the declining trends in freshwater quality,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“These trends in water quality decline are jeopardising our clean, green image on which the health of our economy depends.”</p>
<p>&quot;Looking after our natural environment, including our rivers and lakes, is the best thing we can do to build a stronger economy that in turn looks after all our people,&quot; said Dr Norman.</p>
