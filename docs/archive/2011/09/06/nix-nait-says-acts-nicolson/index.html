<p><strong>Nix NAIT Says ACT&#39;s Nicolson</strong></p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Agriculture Spokesman Don Nicolson is applauding today&#39;s decision by the ACT caucus to oppose the remaining stages (2nd and 3rd readings) of the National Animal Identification and Tracing (NAIT) Bill.</p>
<p>The Bill will require all dairy and deer farmers to tag their animals electronically and register them online as from July 1 next year.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a lemon,&quot; says Mr Nicolson, former Federated Farmers president and ACT&#39;s #4 list candidate.</p>
<p>&quot;NAIT supporters claim it is the ultimate biosecurity measure, the ultimate guarantee against an outbreak of something like foot-and-mouth here. But since tens of millions more ruminant livestock will be out of it than in, that&#39;s a joke. Ultimate bureaucrats&#39; dream, more like it.</p>
<p>&quot;This Bill won&#39;t improve on what the industry already has.The existing national animal-tracing system (paper- and tag-based) is sufficient. If there were a market advantage to an electronic system it could be made a condition of supply without any need for regulation.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand dairy companies are already recognised for quality assurance programmes for livestock management. Our trading partners have exhibited no particular concern about New Zealand’s existing traceability procedures. Yet National and Labour want to railroad farmers, stock agencies and truckers into wasting thousands of dollars in administration time on something they don&#39;t need, with threats of $10,000 fines for failure to comply.</p>

<p>&quot;If this legislation is to be passed, there should be a farmers-only referendum attached to it so that those who would have to pay get to have their say. And its implementation should be delayed till 2017, to coincide with the rolling out of improved broadband. The ACT Party will push for these changes in Parliament after the election.</p>
<p>&quot;NAIT is a further illustration of why farmers should party-vote ACT and ensure a strong voice in Parliament against such unnecessary, draconian and anti-farmer legislation,&quot; Mr Nicolson concludes.</p>
