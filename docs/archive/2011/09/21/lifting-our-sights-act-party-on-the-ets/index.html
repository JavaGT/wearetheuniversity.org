<p><strong>Lifting Our Sights: ACT Party on the ETS</strong></p>
<p>The Emissions Trading Scheme imposes significant costs on all New Zealanders. We need our exporters to lead the way out of our economic crisis – instead we are shooting them in the foot.</p>
<p>Families are paying more for power, fuel and food due to the ETS. Last week’s ETS Advisory Committee’s report recommended the Government slow down the Scheme&#39;s implementation. This won’t help those already suffering.</p>
<p>Whatever you believe about climate change, it makes zero sense for New Zealand to try to lead the world with this ‘all sectors, all gasses’ shambles of a Scheme. Consider these facts:<br>• We produce just <strong>0.2% of the whole world’s</strong> greenhouse gas emissions<br>• <strong>None of our major trading partners</strong> have anything similar to our ETS<br>• The ETS has caused electricity prices to <strong>spike by 5%</strong><br>• It has forced petrol prices up by <strong>4 cents per litre</strong>, which will double by 2013</p>
<p>On top of this, the average dairy farmer is paying an extra <strong>$4,000 each year in diesel</strong> <strong>and electricity costs.</strong> This will rise to over <strong>$10,000 annually</strong> if they start being taxed for animals’ natural bodily functions.</p>
<p>It is preposterous to think that our ETS will make <strong>any</strong> tangible difference to global warming - but it is making a major difference to our <strong>bank accounts</strong>.</p>
<p>ACT will fight to dump the Emissions Trading Scheme, or <strong>have it suspended</strong> until our major trading partners catch up.</p>
<p><strong>ACT NOW</strong> to fight this madness. <strong>Party vote ACT</strong>.</p>
