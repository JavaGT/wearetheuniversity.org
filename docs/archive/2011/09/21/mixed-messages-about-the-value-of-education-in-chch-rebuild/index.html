<p><strong>Mixed messages about the value of education in Christchurch rebuild</strong></p>
<p>The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa says the government is sending very mixed messages about the importance of education in the rebuild of Christchurch.</p>
<p>The government has announced that funding levels to Canterbury’s tertiary institutions will be maintained next year despite an expected decrease in enrolments. It says it will give them greater financial certainty as they work to recover from the effects of the September and February earthquakes and help contribute to the region’s rebuild.</p>
<p>NZEI President Ian Leckie says that’s in stark contrast to the short-sighted approach the government is taking to early childhood services and schools affected by roll drops.</p>
<p>Early childhood services have been given no certainty about their funding even for the remainder of the year and roll drops have meant reduce funding to dozens of centres which are now struggling to maintain staff and keep their doors open.</p>
<p>The government has also refused calls by NZEI to maintain funding and staffing levels for schools until the end of 2012 to help provide additional support to students and keep their learning on track. Schools were told last week that 167 teaching positions will be lost and there are expected to be support staff job losses if operational funding is also cut.</p>
<p>“If the rebuild of Christchurch is to be successful, children must continue to have access to the best quality education. It is very disappointing to see the government placing more value on tertiary education while turning a blind eye to the vital role which early childhood services and schools play in educating and supporting children and families,” says Mr Leckie.</p>

<p>“Principals, teachers and support staff also fulfil an important social role in many traumatised and damaged communities. Children and their families are going to need extra help and attention for a long time to come”.</p>
<p>He says “the government needs to recognise the importance of all education in the rebuild of Christchurch by giving early childhood services and schools the same funding certainty it is giving tertiary institutions. They deserve no less”.</p>
