<p><strong>App to take Science Learning to next level</strong></p>
<p>A newly released app by the University of Waikato’s Science Learning Hub is taking science-education to the forefront of technology and into school students’ hands.</p>
<p>The Science Learning Hub is a national project managed by the University of Waikato and funded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation. The website promotes student interest and engagement in science by providing contemporary resources for teachers, and provides a link between the scientists in New Zealand’s science research organisations, science teachers and educational research.</p>
<p>Recently released, the Science Learning Hub app will make the content available on the website more accessible for school students who have access to iPads, iPods and iPhones. An app for Android technology is currently being developed.</p>
<p>Science Learning Hub project manager Di Hartwell says the app is another tool to help engage students in science.</p>
<p>“We are trying to make the Science Learning Hub accessible in a variety of ways for teachers and their students. The Science Learning Hub app is helping meet the needs of classrooms of the future.</p>
<p>“We know that there is an increasing number of schools who are using iPads, iPods and other tablets so we developed the app in response to these developments in ICT.”</p>
<p>Downloadable off iTunes, the app contains video and images from the website in an easy to navigate format.</p>
<p>“More and more people are going to be using this technology in the future. It’s important that we are engaging students with technology they know and educating them for the future workplace.”</p>
<p>The Science Learning Hub recently won the Education category at the Telecommunications Users Association NZ (TUANZ) 2011 Innovation Awards. The awards honour innovation across New Zealand’s telecommunications sector and is attended by a who’s who of the telecommunications industry.</p>
