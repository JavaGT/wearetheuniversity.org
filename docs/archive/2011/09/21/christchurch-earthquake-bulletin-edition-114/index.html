<p>Christchurch Earthquake bulletin edition 114</p>
<p>A regular bulletin started by the Labour Party&#39;s Christchurch electorate MPs, Clayton Cosgrove (Waimakariri), Ruth Dyson (Port Hills), Lianne Dalziel (Christchurch East) and Brendon Burns (Christchurch Central) to keep people in their electorates and media informed about what is happening at grass roots level.</p>
<p>Description: CANTERBURY EARTHQUAKE RECOVERY PLAN Labour will:<br>* Purchase 1500 properties and sell them at cost to red zoned residents<br>* Ring-fence $100 million as compensation for home improvements<br>* Release all available geotechnical information<br>* Resolve the insurance gridlock<br>* Intervene in the insurance market as a last resort<br>* Make community engagement a priority<br>* Use youth unemployment to fill the skills gap<br>* Establish an independent insurance commissioner For full policy details go to: <a href="http://www.labour.org.nz/news/leadership-needed-to-rebuild-canterbury">http://www.labour.org.nz/news/leadership-needed-to-rebuild-canterbury</a></p>
<p>CLAYTON COSGROVE: AMI&#39;s confirmation today that it will take up to four years to settle claims is another blow for Cantabrians. Given the Government has provided a guarantee to AMI that it is likely to call on it is obvious the Government, though it keeps denying it, is now in the insurance game. Future uncertainty is also created by insurance companies that have been particularly happy to take people&#39;s money during the good times not being so forthcoming when the chips are down and it&#39;s time to pay out. In light of the problems faced by constituents here Labour would establish an independent Insurance Commissioner to not only look at resolving issues in Christchurch but across the industry.</p>

<p>BRENDON BURNS: The Crown&#39;s continuing support of AMI is another signal of the fact that market mechanisms can&#39;t always provide for the best interests of Christchurch and such interventions by a Government are required as measures of last resort. AMI is the biggest provider of household insurance in Christchurch. It has been a proud supporter of our rugby stadium, our symphony orchestra and a host of other good causes. The Canterbury quakes have stretched its reserves and reinsurance bases. Just as EQC&#39;s liabilities have been reassessed and jumped, so have AMI&#39;s; hence yesterday&#39;s $705m loss and the need for the Government to provide an estimated $337m of the earlier guarantee of up to $500m. AMI is now looking at selling parts of its business with the result of it not doing so being the Government taking ownership AMI&#39;s chair Kerry Nolan meanwhile is confident buyers for parts of the business can be found and that the Government back-up will not needed. We all hope that is the case. It is worth recalling that State Insurance, now a private concern, was established by the Crown after the market failed to provide for reinsurance following the Napier quake. Not that private insurers aren&#39;t also often coming to the party. On my weekly bike ride around Avonside and Richmond today, I stopped to talk to two River Rd residents. Both have had payments for their damaged houses from their differing insurers. Both are perfectly happy with the payments.</p>
<p>LIANNE DALZIEL: Great news today. We have got a new electorate office up and running in New Brighton mall, sharing space in the old Harcourt&#39;s office While we are still not completely connected technology-wise - we are still working off our laptops - it&#39;s brilliant to be able to offer constituents a more holistic level of service than we&#39;ve been able to over the last few months. Working virtually has been pretty trying and we couldn&#39;t have done it without the help of some wonderful people, including the people at Ray White real estate who let us work out of their premises. New Brighton escaped the destruction relatively unscathed, and I see the establishment of this latest electorate office as part of the revitalisation of the community. Reimaging the suburb as a vibrant addition to a rebuilt Christchurch community is something we should all be working towards.</p>
<p>RUTH DYSON: I am very keen for the Department of Building and Housing to clarify the timeline around the publication of the new Hills Foundations Standards. It is now over two months late. Given everyone in the Port Hills green zone is required by the city council to get an individual geotech report until these standards are produced, the delay is crazy. Geotechs are like hens teeth - they are difficult to get hold of, hard to organise and expensive. It is heartening that residents seem really confident that the Labour policy is based on a strong connection with communities. The most common reaction has been that &quot;you guys really get it&quot;. As we said at the launch, we know it doesn&#39;t give people 100% happiness but it is a really fair package.</p>
