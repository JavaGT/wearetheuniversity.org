<p><strong>RWC winner says French tactics a risk</strong></p>
<p>Three-time Rugby World Cup winner Dr Farah Palmer says she understands why France may want to field an understrength side against New Zealand this weekend, but the ploy could backfire.</p>
<p>The French side will feature a halfback at first five, a move that has led a number of commentators to the conclusion the team may not be serious about winning.</p>
<p>Dr Palmer – who captained the New Zealand side that won the inaugural Women’s Rugby World Cup tournament in 1998, and then again in 2002 and 2006 – is a senior lecturer at Massey’s School of Management.</p>
<p>She says the French management team may be dealing its own players a psychological blow. “They are obviously taking the long view that coming second in the group gives the team the best path to the final,” she says.</p>
<p>“The danger is that they are also playing mind games with their own players. France has a good record against the All Blacks but if they lose this game at the weekend the players might then be at a psychological disadvantage if the teams meet again later in the tournament.”</p>
<p>However, Palmer says the entire French squad is full of experienced, big game players. “They will lift their game and perform well,” she says “But the top combinations will have had limited game time together heading into the knockout phase of the tournament.”</p>
<p>The All Blacks need to keep their focus firmly on their own performance, Palmer says. “They need to lift their game and really start putting teams away. They have played well but need to finish stronger.”</p>
