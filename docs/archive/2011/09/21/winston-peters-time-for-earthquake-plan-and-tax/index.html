<p>Rt. Hon Winston Peters<br>Leader NZ First</p>
<p>Address to:<br>Cashmere Club<br>82 Hunter Tce Cashmere<br>Christchurch</p>
<p>21 September 2011</p>
<p><em>Extracts from a Speech</em></p>
<p><strong>“Time for Earthquake Plan and Tax”</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First calls on the government to get on with a simple plan to rebuild Christchurch and to impose a special levy to help pay for it.</p>
<p>New Zealand was known to be an earthquake prone country but had never been prepared for the “big ones”.</p>
<p>“It is a sad commentary on New Zealand that a year after the first severe Christchurch earthquake, and seven months after the second one that political leaders are intent on points scoring and taking potshots instead of seeking solutions.</p>
<p>“This week the Labour Party came up with its earthquake policy as though this is a political situation and National’s response was just as pathetic.</p>
<p>“The people of Christchurch whose lives have been turned upside down by events not of their own making just want things fixed and to be kept in the know about what’s happening.</p>
<p>“The solutions are out there and we would like to summarise the best ideas we have seen and to add one or two.</p>
<p>“First: a small special tax levy would help provide an immediate cashflow to help finance the project. The government should set up a special earthquake tax immediately.</p>
<p>Second: “Stable land outside the danger zones should be taken under laws that already exist and the areas should be set aside for rebuilding homes. Individuals should not be permitted to make obscene profits from a disaster.</p>

<p>Third: “New Zealand should stop advertising around the world for tradespeople. Bring some Kiwis back from Australia and start using the tens of thousands of unemployed New Zealanders. Train them on the job if necessary. If our grandparents could build houses, why can’t we?</p>
<p>Fourth: “Start using our own raw materials like the timber from our forests that is going, in its most unprocessed state, offshore to benefit people in other countries.</p>
<p>Fifth: “Sort out our insurance industry and tell the people who pay insurance premiums what is being done to protect them. Homeowners and businesspeople have been paying their insurance bills for decades. What has happened to the money? It has gone in insurance company profits. These companies operate for the benefit of their shareholders or their mutual owners. This mentality has to change.</p>
<p>Sixth: “We have to pay fair compensation for loss and residential rehabilitation. That is what the Prime Minister promised. That is not what he is delivering now where many will be massively out of pocket because of government’s arbitrary and prejudicial decision.</p>
<p>“New Zealand had eighty years to prepare for the next big urban earthquake. Napier was devastated in 1931 and there have been regular earthquake events since then. Why do we avoid facing the future? Another big earthquake is always on the way. It is just a question of where and when.”</p>
<p>An essential element of the so called free market is risk. The insurance industry for years has been assessing risk when setting premiums. On the basis of that risk they have also taken their profits year after year. Now all of a sudden in an earthquake prone country this industry tells us that 81 years after the last really big one in Napier 1931, that we now have to pay twice.</p>
<p>First, to meet those costs that they can’t meet.</p>
<p>Second, that all over the country premiums must now go up and some by a huge amount.</p>
<p>Which begs the question is this how their form of capitalism works? Take all the profits when things are good and then shanghai the taxpayer when things go wrong and the industry has not put aside to cover the inevitable. Is that their idea of what insurance means?</p>
<p>Mr Brownlee’s recent trip to Monaco was a total waste of taxpayers money. You can be certain he never questioned their form of capitalism and merely became a message boy for the industry on higher premiums when he returned.</p>
<p>What’s the government doing about this? Well very little and it’s very hard to conceive of Holyoake, Fraser, Kirk or Muldoon effecting such a limp response.</p>
<p>The folly of selling the State Insurance Office has been cruelly exposed and it is time for New Zealand to once again own an insurance company backed by the government.</p>
<p>“State Insurance was sold so it could be a cash cow for the Insurance Australia Group. Set up over a hundred years ago in 1903, to provide competition for overseas owned insurance companies New Zealand taxpayers owned this company until it was set up as a state owned enterprise in 1990 and sold.</p>
<p>“When will we learn? The Australians bought State Insurance for cash flow and profits. It was not purchased so the Australians could work out better ways of providing benefits to New Zealanders. Things don’t work that way.</p>
<p>“It is obvious that we need to set up our own insurance company once again. Why? Because if there is one certainty in these uncertain times it is there will be another severe earthquake.</p>
<p>“It will simply be when and where. We have a list here of recent major earthquake events in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“There have been fourteen significant quakes since 1848. That’s an average of one about every twelve years. And, we’ve had thirteen other big shakes since 1868. That’s 27 since the Treaty of Waitangi was signed.</p>
<p>“We say to National and Labour and everyone else. Forget about the politics and the point scoring. Get on with sorting out the basics of recovery and look after the people who have been caught in the middle of these disasters. It is not the fault of the victims.</p>
<p>“We also suggest that we stop living in a she’ll be right cuckooland and accept that our country is indeed made up of shaky islands.</p>
<p>“That does not mean our systems should be shaky as well. Wise governments plan for the future. We have to prepare for the worst, and hope for the best and then the people of Christchurch and elsewhere can take what comes”.</p>
