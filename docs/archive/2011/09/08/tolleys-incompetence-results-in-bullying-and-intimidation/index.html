<p>Tolley’s incompetence results in bullying and intimidation</p>
<p>Schools have been intimidated and bullied into adopting National Standards when they do not agree they will deliver results for students, Labour education spokesperson Sue Moroney says.</p>
<p>“Schools that believe there is no educational merit in the standards have been threatened and bullied by a Minister who has failed to convince teachers of the merits of the system,” Sue Moroney said.</p>
<p>“Forcing schools by intimidating them to implement National Standards against their will is detrimental to children’s education.</p>
<p>“The only option left for those who disagree with National Standards is to vote to change the Government at the election in November.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders will have a clear choice this election to choose between blind ideology in National Standards or policies that put children first,” Sue Moroney said.  </p>
