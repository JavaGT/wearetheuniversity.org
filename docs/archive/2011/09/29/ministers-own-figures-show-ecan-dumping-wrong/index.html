<p><strong>Minister’s own figures show ECAN dumping wrong</strong></p>
<p>Environment Minister Nick Smith shot himself in the foot today by proving he was not justified in sacking Environment Canterbury councillors last year, Labour’s Water spokesman Brendon Burns says.</p>
<p>The Minister presented a survey of how local authorities performed on the timely processing of resource consents across three measured years to the Local Government and Environment Committee this morning.</p>
<p>“As recently as yesterday Dr Smith was still bagging Environment Canterbury - ECAN –for its supposed poor performance during 2007/08 year, something he used to justify him ending democratic decision-making and installing Commissioners.</p>
<p>“Yet the figures he showed us today (see below) prove he was singularly selective in taking out ECAN. Five other councils had worse results than ECAN across the same timeframe,” Brendon Burns said.</p>
<p>“Auckland, Manukau, Westland, Far North and his own city of Nelson, all had poorer cumulative performance across 2005/05 and 2007/08 than ECAN. Those councillors all still have their jobs.</p>
<p>“There was never a case for Canterbury’s water to be taken from democratic control, and given the Minister’s refusal today to commit to a fresh election in 2013, it’s looking increasingly unlikely those fundamental rights will ever be returned under a National/ACT Government,” Brendon Burns said.</p>
<p>Across the 2005/06 and 2007/08 years, the following councils recorded this cumulative percentage of resource consents processed on time. Manukau District Council 33% + 35% (68%); Westland District Council 55% + 30%, (85%); Far North District Council 51%+37%, (88%); Auckland City Council 52%+45%,( 95%); Nelson City Council, 41%+57%, (98%); Environment Canterbury, 72%+29%,( 101%) processed on time over the two years measured.</p>
