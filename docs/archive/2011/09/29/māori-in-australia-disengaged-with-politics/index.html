<p><strong>Thursday, 29 September 2011, 2:20 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Māori in Australia disengaged with politics</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>A survey of voting habits of Māori living in Australia suggests this group is increasingly disengaged with politics on both sides of the Tasman.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Seventy-two percent of respondents to the survey stated they did not vote in the 2008 New Zealand election. In addition, 79% of respondents stated that they were not aware that there is a referendum on the voting system in New Zealand this year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Victoria University Political Scientist Dr Maria Bargh who conducted the survey says the results back up previous research which has suggested that Māori in Australia are poorly represented in the political process.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“With at least 110,000 Māori in Australia, it begs the question—who is representing their interests?” says Dr Bargh.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The survey, which ran for three months, also looked at Māori attitudes to the electoral system, as New Zealand approaches a referendum on the voting system.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Given the importance of voting systems for fostering or inhibiting particular groups to become represented, this lack of awareness is a concern,” says Dr Bargh.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr Bargh says many of the responses indicated some despondency about the ability to influence politics.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In a 2008 article, researcher Paul Hamer described Māori in Australia as “massively disenfranchised” with few continuing to vote in New Zealand elections and those in Australia tending not to become Australian citizens, and therefore ineligible to vote there.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The latest survey also showed that 72% of respondents did not vote in the last Australian federal election. In addition, 63% of respondents stated they did not feel politically represented at the Australian Federal or State levels.</strong></p>
