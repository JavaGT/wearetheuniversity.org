<p>Scholarship for commitment towards wetland research</p>
<p>University of Waikato Science student Yvonne Taura has been awarded a $15,000 Scholarship by the Māori Education Trust.</p>
<p>Taura, who is completing her Master of Science (MSc) thesis, was awarded the Rose Hellaby Postgraduate Scholarship for her commitment to researching environmental issues for her Iwi, Ngati Tuwharetoa.</p>
<p>After completing a Bachelor of Environmental Science at Te Whare Wananga O Awanuiarangi in Whakatane, she was contracted by her hapū to research environmental impacts concerning the quality and influences on whanau lands within the South Taupo Wetland.</p>
<p>The results of which spurred her interest in continuing the research as her MSc topic.</p>
<p>“My research focuses on freshwater ecology in particular wetland ecosystems, which stems from my work in Turangi where my hapū have concerns about willow management.”</p>
<p>Willows were introduced to New Zealand by early European settlers and have since become a dominant feature of many rivers and wetlands. This has prompted conservation efforts to control willow invasion.</p>
<p>“My research involves studying aquatic invertebrate abundance and composition, and water quality to measure any affects caused by willow growth and control treatment. Current willow control involves the use of non-specific herbicides.</p>
<p>“As part of my study I collect and analyse zooplankton and water samples. Zooplankton is an important biotic component within aquatic ecosystems, including food chain and food webs for aquatic invertebrates, fish and birds. They can be used as a biological indicator for identifying changes within the wetland and can determine whether willow control has detrimental impacts on food cycles and water quality within the wetland,” says Taura.</p>

<p>“My research is part of a collaborative effort with Landcare Research, NIWA, DOC and the University of Waikato to work together in delivering scientifically based guidelines, techniques and tools to improve management and guide restoration of freshwater wetlands throughout New Zealand.</p>
<p>“When I finish my MSc I hope to work as a freshwater ecologist and offer my services to support environmental programmes set up by my Iwi.”</p>
<p>She will receive the scholarship at a ceremony later this year.</p>
