<p>LABOUR MPs</p>
<p>15 September 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Christchurch Earthquake bulletin edition 112</strong><br>The Labour Party’s Christchurch electorate MPs, <strong>Clayton Cosgrove (Waimakariri), Ruth Dyson (Port Hills), Lianne Dalziel (Christchurch East) and Brendon Burns (Christchurch Central)</strong> have started a regular bulletin to keep people in their electorates and media informed about what is happening at grass roots level.</p>
<p><strong>CLAYTON COSGROVE:</strong> Finally, last night in Kaiapoi there was a Residents’ Association meeting with a point of difference --- Cabinet Minister and member of the Government’s Ad Hoc Cabinet Committee on Canterbury Earthquake Recovery (ACE), Kate Wilkinson actually stood up and answered some questions. When asked why individual land and geotechnical reports were not being released to residents the Minister suggested residents get their own experts, helpfully proposing they even band together in streets to meet the cost of acquiring such expert analysis. There are a number of things wrong with this suggestion. Firstly, in case it had gone unnoticed, people aren’t exactly rolling in cash in Kaiapoi. Why would they pay to get expert assessments when Gerry Brownlee already has that information--- which has been paid for by taxpayers--- and is simply refusing to pass it on? Secondly, it puts the onus on residents to clarify the status of their land when it was the Government who categorised them in the first place. The whole situation exposes a disengaged Minister whose decision-making is being impaired due to her refusal to engage with the community in a constructive way.</p>

<p><strong>RUTH DYSON:</strong> I have been interviewed by Joe Davies, Head Boy from Linwood College, who is making a documentary looking at the impacts of, and response to, the February quakes from the perspective of Mt Pleasant residents. Joe is a hugely talented young man and it is fantastic that the story will be put together. The documentary will be a great resource for all of us to have and to learn from, particularly in regard to building stronger communities in the future. The Mt Pleasant Residents&#39; Association had a very well attended meeting this week at which four local architects led a discussion about the city to the sea master plan, the link between Mt Pleasant and Ferrymead as a shopping and business centre, and the gateway to the beaches concept. All were well-received. Our connection to the estuary and how it could be enhanced was also discussed as was the sustainable rebuild of Mr Pleasant itself. We also had a lively and positive discussion about the Mt Pleasant Community Centre - ranging from where it should be, what it should look like and what it should house. Great proactive, community led recovery thinking - well done Mt Pleasant.</p>
<p><strong>BRENDON BURNS:</strong> Sometimes if feels like one step forward, one backwards. The first concrete pour for a new building within the inner CBD has taken place and unsurprisingly it is for Ballantynes. The store has long defended the need to retain CBD shopping and is at the forefront of the Re:Start 29.10.11 effort (<a href="http://business.scoop.co.nz/2011/04/07/vibrant-retail-area-up-and-running-in-cbd-from-show-week/">http://business.scoop.co.nz/2011/04/07/vibrant-retail-area-up-and-running-in-cbd-from-show-week/</a> ) which will see itself and a suite of other shops open by Show Weekend in November. While long-term development plans are finalised, the new building will temporarily replace the rear part of the Ballantynes complex which had to be demolished. Such demolitions are not always warranted. A call last night alerted me to what appears to be the looming demolition of another city icon.The Canterbury Horse Bazaar, is a gorgeous century-old brick building which frames an entire block on Madras St. Now The Bedford Pub, it has Historic Places Trust classification and has had some strengthening done as suggested by the fact it’s still standing and largely intact. My understanding is that CERA proposed to require ‘make safe’ work as no detailed engineering report has been completed. Instead, it’s being scheduled for demolition. Soon, nothing of heritage value will remain in our city. Where are the voices of the Historic Places Trust or the Minister for Culture, Arts and Heritage, Chris Finlayson whose jobs are to save buildings like the Canterbury Horse Bazaar from the onslaught of the bulldozers?</p>
<p><strong>LIANNE DALZIEL</strong>: I was very sorry to read of Cr Chrissie Williams retirement from the council. Her contribution has been outstanding and the council will be the poorer for her leaving. Chrissie and I worked together very closely over a range of issues, and post-earthquake we organised joint community meetings to provide people with information about the earthquakes and how all the agencies operate – EQC, the insurers and the PMOs. Chrissie has been an outstanding representative for the people she was elected to serve. We had a Christchurch City Council representative at the Regulations Review Committee today to discuss the impact of the red and yellow stickers issued by Civil Defence after the earthquake being deemed to be s124 notices under the Building Act by Order in Council. This has implications for what is recorded on people’s Land Information Memorandum’s (LIMS). These ten minute perimeter checks would not have been sufficient to sustain a Building Act notice so I remain concerned about the issue.</p>
