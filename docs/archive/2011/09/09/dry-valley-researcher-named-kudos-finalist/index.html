<p>Dr Charles Lee from the University of Waikato department of Biological Science has been nominated as a finalist in the 2011 Kudos awards for his work uncovering the unusual ecology of microorganisms in Antarctica’s McMurdo Dry Valleys.</p>
<p>Nominated in the Emerging Scientist Category, Dr Lee’s research on the soil microbiota of the Dry Valleys could lead to a better understanding of the changing Antarctic environment.</p>
<p>The Kudos awards are a Waikato initiative held once a year to celebrate science achievement in the region.</p>
<p>“The Dry Valleys are ice-free all year round and basically a cold, seemingly lifeless desert,” says Dr Lee.</p>
<p>“For a long time, people had this idea that the environment in the Dry Valleys was largely sterile.”</p>
<p>Scientists found bacterial life in the Dry Valleys using DNA-based molecular genetic techniques, necessary as the organisms are very sparse in the soil and mostly uncultivable.</p>
<p>“In terms of microbiology, we now know there is quite a lot of microbial diversity in the Dry Valleys. The make-up of microbial communities is heavily influenced by the environment, so if Antarctica changes in the next few years we are likely to see drastic changes in these microbial communities.”</p>

<p>University of Waikato scientists have led New Zealand’s terrestrial biological research in Antarctica for more than 25 years and spend every summer carrying out fieldwork on the frozen continent.</p>
<p>“My research is about understanding our environment and may lead to significant changes in our understanding of Antarctica.”</p>
<p>Dr Lee is part of the university’s International Centre for Terrestrial Antarctic Research and is currently leading a project supported by the Marsden Fund to study the bacteria living in the Dry Valleys.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato has two other finalists in the Kudos awards – Dr Anne Hume and Dr Johan Verbeek. The winners of the awards will be announced at a dinner on Thursday October 13.</p>
