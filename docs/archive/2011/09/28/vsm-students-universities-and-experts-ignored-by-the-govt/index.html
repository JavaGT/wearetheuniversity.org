<p><strong>VSM: Students, universities and experts ignored by the Government</strong></p>
<p>The Council of Trade Unions youth wing, Stand Up, has slammed National’s support for ACT’s Voluntary Student Membership Bill.</p>
<p>Stand Up Spokesperson James Sleep says ACT and National&#39;s pushing through of VSM after ignoring 98% of submitters who opposed the Bill in the Select Committee process shows they are out of touch with students.</p>
<p>“Student associations provide a voice for students and deliver important services that provide support. This law will put this all at risk” said Sleep.</p>
<p>“This is not as black and white as ACT and National are claiming. This law will take away sustainable funding for important welfare, education and advocacy services that are important to the well being and academic success of students.&quot;</p>
<p>“Students, universities and experts are rightfully frustrated. They have been ignored. The Government is ignoring a reasonable compromise which proposes an &#39;opt-out&#39; system similar to Kiwisaver, this proposal is supported by various members of the National Party such as Michael Woodhouse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We support the action occurring today up and down the country and call on the Government to reconsider how this ideologically driven law will impact on students&quot; concludes Sleep.</p>
