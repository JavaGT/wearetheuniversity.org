<p>Come on John Key - don&#39;t pass it, kick it!... And give students the final say.</p>
<p>Students and the public will be rallying at Parliament this afternoon against ACT’s Bill to end universal membership of students’ associations. The rally comes as student leaders call on the Government to ensure students have the final say on this legislation.</p>
<p>“Politics can be like a rugby match sometimes. When it comes to this Bill we continue to say to National - don’t pass it, kick it! They still have that opportunity to drop its support for this extreme and inflexible Bill, and instead work with students on fairer alternatives for improving student services and representation, rather than gutting them,” says NZUSA Co-President David Do.</p>
<p>Today’s rally will also demonstrate cross-party support for a balanced solution that is a fair alternative to ACT’s extreme Bill. Members of Parliament from the Labour, Green, Maori, and Mana parties will speak to the rally and sign a joint statement agreed to by their parties.</p>
<p>Student representatives have also sent an open letter to the Prime Minister this morning urging him to amend ACT’s bill so that students can determine this issue on their own campuses through referenda. The letter, signed by 17 national and local student presidents and representatives from most universities and polytechnics, points out that students voted nationwide on this issue in 1999 after legislation creating the current law was passed under National in 1998.</p>
<p>“We recognise that this has been a passionately debated issue of significant interest amongst students, the tertiary sector, and the wider community That’s why we believe it is reasonable, pragmatic, and fair to give students the final say in legislation that will directly affect them, their education, their services, and the representation they have on their campus,” says Do.</p>

<p>“If students collectively want universal membership, they should be able to vote for it. And equally, if they want voluntary membership, that choice should be theirs as well. It should not be imposed against students’ will by government in the form of a quite extreme and inflexible Bill,” said Do.</p>
<p>“National has a clear choice – support a balanced solution and work on better policies with students, or continue to reward an ACT party that looks discredited, dopey, and in disarray. We hope National makes the right choice today,” concluded Do.</p>
<p>Attached is the letter sent to the Prime Minister and the statement to be signed by MPs this afternoon.</p>
