<p><strong>Wednesday, 28 September 2011, 2:25 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students'_Association">Otago University Students&#39; Association</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moderation or Extremism – Woodhouse’s choice</strong></p>
<p>The Otago University Association is today asking the National Dunedin List MP Michael Woodhouse to stick to the message he told students earlier this year while attending a VSM and politics debate on campus.</p>
<p><strong>The clear choice before Mr. Woodhouse is to vote for the moderation he advocated for by voting against the anti-Student VSM Bill or vote for ACT’s extremism.</strong></p>
<p>In a video posted on YouTube yesterday that was filmed during the debate, when asked about the VSM Bill Mr. Woodhouse stated, “I don’t personally support the Bill as it is introduced at the moment, I think there are some improvements that could be made to it.”</p>
<p>In reference to the opt-out option where students would have the option to opt-out easily rather than go through the process of applying to conscientiously object and then donate the cost of student membership to a charity he stated, “I think that’s an entirely appropriate compromise.”</p>
<p>Woodhouse went on to reassure students that the bill was unlikely to go through this present term saying, “I’m almost certain that the Bill won’t go through in its present form this term of parliament.” He then continued to say that another year would allow the government to “introduce those moderations.”</p>
<p>Logan Edgar President of OUSA is calling for Mr. Woodhouse to stick to what he told students as he says, &quot;We hope Mr. Woodhouse will stay true to his word and vote against the flawed VSM bill.&quot;</p>

<p>After protests around the country over the last few months, along with the support of 98% of submissions that were against the VSM or Education [Freedom of Association] Amendment Bill, including those from the Dunedin City Council, the Human Rights Commission and notably the University of Otago itself.</p>
<p>OUSA asks that the National Government, and all those voting to listen to the submissions, the protests, and to the students who are directly affected by this Bill.</p>
