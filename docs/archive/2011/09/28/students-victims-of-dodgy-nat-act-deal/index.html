<p><strong>Students victims of dodgy Nat-ACT deal</strong></p>
<p>Students are from today the losers in a dodgy deal between National and ACT on the Voluntary Student Membership Bill, Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson David Shearer says.</p>
<p>“National and ACT will today pass the VSM Bill which will effectively deny students the ability to be involved in the delivery of student services,” David Shearer said.</p>
<p>“National is only supporting this Bill to prop up an imploding and ineffective ACT Party. Heather Roy was dumped by ACT and National as a Cabinet Minister.</p>
<p>“As a consolation prize to keep her and ACT’s coalition votes, National agreed to support legislation that isn’t wanted or needed by the students it affects. That also killed a compromise Labour had suggested which some National MPs had agreed to.</p>
<p>“Labour fought hard against this Bill, because we listened to the students and the tertiary institutions that it effects. National and ACT have turned a deaf ear to the students because they are blinded by ideology, or perhaps simply too arrogant to listen.</p>
<p>“The ACT Party MPs who are supporting this legislation aren’t even going to be here next term to see the consequences. They are deserting ACT as it sinks into oblivion.</p>
<p>“This Bill will hamper students’ ability to access services ranging from, careers advice, health care, crèches and from having a proper say on student councils because student association funds will inevitably dry up.</p>
<p>“Instead, the institutions themselves will need to pick up vital services and will then bill students for them. Students will still pay, but get no say.</p>
<p>“It’s poor legislation and it was a poor decision by National to sell out students in order to get five votes from the ACT Party,” David Shearer said.</p>
<p>“A Labour Government will repeal the VSM Bill.”</p>
