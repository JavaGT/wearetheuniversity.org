<p>Top University of Waikato award for Topp Twins</p>
<p>New Zealand’s famous and favourite comedy pair, Jools and Lynda Topp, will be presented with honorary doctorates from the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>The Topp Twins, raised on a farm near Huntly, will have their degrees conferred at a capping ceremony on October 20 in Hamilton’s Founders Theatre.</p>
<p>The comedians, singers, feminists and social activists have entertained audiences for more than 30 years, starting as buskers in downtown Auckland before undertaking numerous New Zealand and overseas tours, cutting at least eight records and making more than a dozen television shows and a movie.</p>
<p>“We like the Topp Twins because they’re not only entertainers, they have a social conscience,” says University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford. “They worked out a long time ago that people will usually listen to a song before a speech. And they have a charming ability to send people up without pulling them down.”</p>
<p>Jools and Lynda Topp were high-profile opponents of the 1981 Springbok rugby tour, strong proponents of homosexual law reform, and vocal campaigners for Māori land rights and Nuclear-Free New Zealand.</p>
<p>Their movie, Untouchable Girls, was released in 2009 and immediately broke records for best opening day and weekend in New Zealand’s movie history. The documentary charts the twins’ life stories and highlights major social and political movements during the last three decades. It also tracks Jools’ diagnosis, treatment and recovery from breast cancer.</p>

<p>Professor Crawford says the University of Waikato has been committed to gender equality since the early 1970s.</p>
<p>“Feminism has informed teaching and research in many disciplines – education, psychology, history, philosophy, law, management, Māori and Pacific development, tourism and geography. The region has a reputation for producing strong women. To honour the Topp Twins is a natural and perfect fit.”</p>
<p>The twins will receive their honorary doctorates at 10am at the October 20 graduation ceremony.</p>
