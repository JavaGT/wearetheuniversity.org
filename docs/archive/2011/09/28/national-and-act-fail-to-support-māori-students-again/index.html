<p><strong>Wednesday, 28 September 2011, 1:07 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/National_Maori_Students'_Association">National Maori Students&#39; Association</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>National and ACT fail to support Māori Students, again. See you at the Tribunal!</strong></p>
<p>“Māori students today are not surprised that the Government continues to support the ACT Party’s Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill in its third reading”, says Jacqualene Poutu, Tumuaki of Te Mana Ākonga, the National Māori Students’ Association.</p>
<p>“This long standing Bill has dragged out for over two years where we have seen no willingness by the National Government to hear the voice of the tertiary sector, and as a consequence no support for whanau, hapū and iwi growth and stability”, declares Poutu.</p>
<p>“The Bill compounds the challenges faced by Māori students in tertiary education and signifies the lack of integrity the National and ACT parties have for Māori”, contends Poutu. “The Crown’s failure to acknowledge and address any impacts on Māori students in the Regulatory Impact Statement for the Bill 2009, and the Education &amp; Science Select Committee Report 2010 elucidate this.</p>
<p>A formal Treaty of Waitangi Claim was lodged on 31 August 2011 by Te Mana Ākonga Executive and Alumni and highlights the prejudicial effects against Māori students in the tertiary sector.</p>
<p>“As soon as the Bill becomes legislation, the Claim will be active and Te Mana Ākonga will seek redress through the Tribunal. This could have been avoided if National and ACT had the capacity and integrity to listen to Māori students”, argues Poutu.</p>
<p>“The Crown’s inaction to recognise Māori as a Treaty Partner to the Crown and therefore make provision to protect the Treaty relationship is highlighted in the Claim. We will continue the fight to be heard and our needs addressed by the Crown which has benefits for Māori students, their whanau, hapū and iwi advancement as a people,” concludes Poutu.</p>
