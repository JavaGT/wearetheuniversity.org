<p><strong>Monday, 12 September 2011, 1:14 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander Pope and the poetry of science</strong></p>
<p>At the dawn of the Scientific Revolution, science was mocked by poets—but there was also reverence and respect, says a Victoria University Professor of English Literature.</p>
<p>In her inaugural Professorial lecture on Tuesday 20 September, Professor Kathryn Walls will examine how the foremost 18th century English poet Alexander Pope used science in his poetry.</p>
<p>In the lecture, titled <em>“God said, Let Newton Be”: Alexander Pope and the Scientific Revolution</em> Professor Walls will explain that Pope, like his contemporary Jonathan Swift, mercilessly satirised scientists.</p>
<p>“They were part of a reactionary movement—science was seen as a fad, an addiction and as a waste of time It didn’t seem to be producing any practical benefits.”</p>
<p>Professor Walls says it is not surprising that poets were opposed to science.</p>
<p>“Poetry plays with words. It delights in paradox and ambiguity. Scientists value precision and clarity—the mentality is utterly different.”</p>
<p>However, Professor Walls believes Pope’s attitude to science was complex.</p>
<p>“Pope attended a series of lectures given by one of Newton’s disciples, and the scientific discoveries of the day clearly influenced his thought.”</p>
<p>The lecture will focus on two of Pope’s most famous poems—and show that while he satirised scientists, he processed their discoveries into metaphors.</p>
<p>Professor Walls says she has always been interested in how and why poetry changes from one century to the next.</p>

<p>“This is why I hit upon the popularisation of science in the early 18th century—I recognised that it explained what was happening to poetic imagery.”</p>
<p>Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says Professor Walls is an excellent researcher and teacher.</p>
<p>“Professor Walls’ research strengths are particularly evident in her most important publication, the scholarly edition of William Baspoole&#39;s <em>The Pilgrime</em>, a politically-loaded religious allegory, written on the eve of the English Civil War. But she has published over an unusually wide range of periods and authors.</p>
<p>“Her teaching is exemplary; she is experienced at all levels and the quality of her postgraduate supervision, both in English and in Creative Writing, is particularly noteworthy.”</p>
<p>Professor Walsh says Victoria’s Inaugural Lecture series is an opportunity for professors to provide family, friends, colleagues and the wider community with an insight into their specialist area of study.</p>
<p>“It is also an opportunity for the University to celebrate and acknowledge our valued professors,” says Professor Walsh.</p>
<p>Professor Kathryn Walls’ inaugural lecture will be held on Tuesday 20 September at 6pm at Victoria University’s Hunter Council Chamber, Level 2, Hunter Building, Gate 1 or 2, Kelburn Parade, Wellington.</p>
