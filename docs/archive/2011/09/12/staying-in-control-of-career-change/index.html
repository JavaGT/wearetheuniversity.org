<h3>Staying in control of career change</h3>
<p>Denice Bennett-Rae doesn’t fluff around.<br>The chartered accountant was the financial controller for a US$35 billion international corporate when she promptly decided to take on a University of Auckland MBA.</p>
<p>Then nearing the end of study, she made a calculated move that will see her career journey less likely to end in a corner office, and more likely to seriously contribute to the success of SMEs in New Zealand.</p>
<p>You could say fluff has now become the stock and trade of Bennettt-Rae, a 43-year-old true-blue Aucklander. She is now chief financial officer of Bay of Plenty not-for-profit Energy Options, a 2009 Deloitte fast-50 listed, award-winning company that aims to create healthier, insulated homes while being kind to the environment. Its turnover has increased 170 per cent in the past few years.</p>
<p>Bennett-Rae says a not-for-profit like Energy Options needs to operate in the same way as any SME – make a surplus to survive through smart-thinking and witty problem-solving.</p>
<p>“It’s vital that business processes keep up with growth. And in an SME or not-for-profit, you have to be more of an all-rounder. You get the latitude you wouldn’t elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Personal growth, along with growth in business nous, is something she says comes with the MBA territory.</p>
<p>Her move to Energy Options also meant a move to Whakatane, where wine and food appreciation opportunities are limited, but there is, thankfully, Ceroc dancing. And the opportunity for Bennett-Rae’s other hobby, study, can be sought anywhere. She’s thinking about building on her MBA with a PhD.</p>

<p>She chose the MBA because, as an accountant, Bennett-Rae didn’t want to do a master of finance.</p>
<p>“I wanted something that would give me a broader business base.”<br>In her role at the time, the company’s managing director had left - twice.</p>
<p>“I’d stepped up to fill the breach. And I thought, ‘I can do this’, but didn’t want to be boxed into being the ‘finance person’.”</p>
<p>So she began MBA study in 2008. She wanted to become a CFO. Then the MBA happened. She wanted to become a CEO. Goals began to shift.<br>The well-defined parameters of the course suited Bennett-Rae’s no-nonsense approach.</p>
<p>“It was lockstep. It started and it finished. It would be fair to say that my initial goal was simply to have the MBA. But I quickly worked out there were some valuable group experiences to have along the way.”</p>
<p>The unique strengths of the MBA group were just as important as the content of the course.</p>
<p>“It was really energizing and kind of neat to be in an environment with similar people who were there to achieve the same goals and outcomes.”</p>
<p>“I think any one of us we would say the same - we gained as much, if not more from the others in the cohort than the lecturers standing up in front of us.”</p>
<p>Bennett-Rae says she and her fellow students think their bunch is “pretty special.”</p>
<p>And of course they insist they’re an unequalled brains trust - the MBA attracts very competitive individuals. It’s just that after a while, they stop competing with each other, and tend to start competing as a group.</p>
<p>“That’s probably best demonstrated by my marks - I had a string of A+ marks in the first year and slightly less in the latter part of the second year.”</p>
<p>That’s when study took on a more holistic aspect. The brains trust was without brain food during Saturday study. So she organized catering, Bennett-Rae’s own husband deployed to fetch and deliver.<br>“That one thing made the lecturers say we were an entrepreneurial and tight group.”</p>
<p>The cohort was operating in an environment where friendships and networks were made for life.</p>
<p>“The University of Auckland MBA has broadened my thinking, added to my thinking and solidified my thinking on where I want my career to go.”</p>
<p>“Working for someone else is not going to be enough. Before, I would’ve been quite happy to for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p>Bennett-Rae was headed for a big chair in the corner office. Now she wants to influence, wants a ‘place at the table’.<br>“I’ve considered pursuing independent directorships, going into governance. Or setting up a consultancy for growing SMEs.”</p>
