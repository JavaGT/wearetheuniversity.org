<p><strong>Tuesday, 13 September 2011, 9:54 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Student To Contest Wellington Seat For NZ First</p>
<p>New Zealand First has selected university student Ben Craven to contest the seat of Wellington Central at the General Election on November 26.</p>
<p>At twenty-one years of age, he will be one of the country’s youngest parliamentary candidates in the general election this year.</p>
<p>Mr Craven, who studies philosophy and political Science at Victoria University of Wellington, said he identified strongly with New Zealand First because of its core values of community and social responsibility.</p>
<p>&quot;Underlying these principles is a commitment to the nation as a whole rather than to class or sectional interest. We are the only party that takes the concept of<br>New Zealand seriously,&quot; said Mr Craven.</p>
<p>Despite his youth, Mr Craven has travelled extensively in Europe, South East Asia and the Pacific. This, he said, had shaped his understanding of politics back home. He is concerned about the decline of social capital and the present lack of leadership from both Labour and National.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to have confidence in ourselves as a nation if we are to get back on top again.  With the right values and the right leadership, we can be great again.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Craven said New Zealand First had both the vision and the resolve to take the country forward.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters described Mr Craven as highly intelligent, dependable and one of New Zealand’s future leaders.</p>
<p>“He will more than hold his own against rival candidates in the electorate,” he said.</p>
