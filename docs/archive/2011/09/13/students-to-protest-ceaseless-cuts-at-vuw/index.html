<p><strong>Students to protest ceaseless cuts at VUW</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, 13 September 2011, 9:18 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: We are the University (Wgtn)</strong></p>
<p>Students at Victoria University will be protesting the ongoing cuts to staff, resources and academic freedoms at 12:30 on Wednesday 14th.</p>
<p>Postgraduate student Amanda Thomas says “We come to this university to learn and make meaningful contributions to our communities. The decisions made by University management are making this increasingly difficult.” She says “Staff and course cuts, particularly to the humanities, are making this an extremely shallow institution and this is reflected in the announcement this week that Victoria is sliding down the international university rankings.” She adds.</p>
<p>Undergraduate student Adam Osbourne-Smith is “frustrated, seeing my friends taking papers or majors and then finding that they can’t finish what they’d expected to when they first enrolled.”</p>
<p>“You can’t slash student choice, without student and staff consultation, and expect the University’s quality to stay the same. What’s more, Victoria had an almost $16 million surplus last year so these cuts are completely unjustified.” Says Thomas.</p>
<p>Victoria University have been cutting away at various schools and programmes over the last five years, mainly in the humanities, but students campus-wide have been affected.</p>
