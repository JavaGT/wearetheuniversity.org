<p><strong>Tuesday, 13 September 2011, 9:41 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour welcomes Child Poverty Action Group support</p>
<p>The Child Poverty Action Group report released today confirms Labour&#39;s policies on children and child poverty are on the right track, Labour Deputy Leader Annette King says.</p>
<p>&quot;The Child Poverty Action Group has mirrored much of the policy that has already been announced by Labour,&quot; Annette King said.</p>
<p>&quot;A Minister for Children, child impact assessments of existing and new policy, good parenting support and training allowances all feature as part of Labour policy.</p>
<p>&quot;I am pleased that so many organisations are coming together with the shared view that we must all do better for our children.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour also believes that the eradication of child poverty in this country needs to a priority, in order to achieve that Governments must enshrine in legislation milestones and goals.</p>
<p>&quot;I was horrified when Minister of Social Development Paula Bennett last week told Parliament that she was unable to say whether her Government had done anything to lift a single Kiwi child out of poverty. Because they did not believe measuring child poverty was important</p>
<p>&quot;For Labour lifting children out of poverty is unfinished business and we will be announcing further policies that deal with this hugely important issue in the near future.</p>
<p>&quot;We know there are anomalies in the in Work Tax Credit portion of Working for Families and we have been looking at how we address that issue.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be ensuring that our policies on health, housing, education and welfare all play a role in helping to lift children and their families out of poverty.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important that governments have the best information to work with. Refusing to further fund the University of Auckland&#39;s Growing-up in New Zealand study following 7000 children from birth, is short-sighted and contrary to the Government&#39;s own claim that policy needs to be evidence based,&quot; Annette King said</p>
