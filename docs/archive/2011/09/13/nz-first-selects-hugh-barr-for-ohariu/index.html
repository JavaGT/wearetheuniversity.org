<p><strong>Tuesday, 13 September 2011, 9:52 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>NZ First Selects Hugh Barr For Ohariu</p>
<p>New Zealand First has selected scientist and outdoor recreation advocate Dr Hugh Barr as its candidate for Ohariu at the General Election on November 26.</p>
<p>Dr Barr has an extensive background, of over thirty years, in outdoor recreation, and similar experience as a consulting scientist dealing with many issues central to New Zealand’s prosperity and wellbeing.</p>
<p>He says he is especially concerned about restoring Crown ownership of the foreshore and seabed, retaining ownership of New Zealand assets and the principle of one law for all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>Dr Barr wrote a book, “The Gathering Storm over the Foreshore and Seabed – Why it should remain in Crown ownership” to help the public understand the issue.</p>
<p>For the last year, he has been Co-Chair of the Coastal Coalition, a group of tens of thousands that campaigned against National’s legislation to allow privatisation of New Zealand’s foreshore and seabed to iwi groups.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters describes Dr Barr as an outstanding New Zealander who has already made a significant contribution to science and outdoor recreation.</p>
<p>“His ability to identify and confront the main issues facing New Zealand is sorely needed at a time when the future ownership of our natural resources and publicly owned assets is at stake.</p>
<p>“Dr Barr will be reminding the people of Ohariu that they need a strong advocate for their rights and not someone who serves as a puppet to whatever political party is in power.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have someone of his calibre carrying the message of New Zealand First,” says Mr. Peters.</p>
