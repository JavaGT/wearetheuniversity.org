<p><strong>Top harness racing award for student</strong></p>
<p>Massey University master’s student Jasmine Tanner has won a major harness racing award.</p>
<p>She was named the North Island’s best licence to train/owner trainer at the weekend’s North Island Harness Racing Awards. A licence to train allows her to train as many of her own horses as she likes and up to six horses for clients.</p>
<p>Miss Tanner, who juggles her studies with training three horses at the Manawatu Trotting Club in Palmerston North, was presented with the award at the annual dinner in Auckland.</p>
<p>She rises early to train her horses in the morning before coming to Massey, returning to feed them at night. “It’s a long and busy day but it’s good,” she says.</p>
<p>Her thesis, funded by the New Zealand Racing Board, investigates how racing as a two-year old affects career length and success in both Thoroughbred and Standardbred horses. It will be published in the <em>New Zealand Veterinary Journal</em> and the <em>Equine Veterinary Journal.</em></p>
<p>Miss Tanner, from Auckland, learned horse training from one of New Zealand’s best trainers, Steven Reid. “I learned a lot of the skills from him,” she says. “It’s about knowing how to bring a horse to peak fitness and maintain them there while trying to prevent injury.”</p>
<p>But she says her studies at Massey University have helped take her training further. “It helps because I now understand more about how training works,” she says. “I’ve learned the physiology, so I can now understand how and why the things we do during training work. I can also try new theories that I’ve learned through that knowledge of the horse’s body system – for example the way you can apply training load to a horse to get the best out of it.”</p>

<p>Her award capped a big year for her stable, led by three-time winner Barney Maguire. “I actually got him as an older horse that had had about 35 starts for another trainer but never really been any good. I got him and turned him around and he ended up winning three races for me with numerous placings as well.”</p>
<p>In all, she had 28 starters for four wins, four seconds and five thirds last year.</p>
<p>Miss Tanner says she is hoping to begin a PhD at Massey next year, again focusing on the equine industry, while continuing to train horses on the side.</p>
