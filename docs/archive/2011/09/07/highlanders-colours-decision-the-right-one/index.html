<p>Highlanders colours decision the right one</p>
<p>Dunedin South Labour MP Clare Curran says the Highlanders have made the right decision by ditching their controversial new green jersey for home games, deciding to use it only for away matches next year.</p>
<p>Clare Curran said it was good to see the Highlanders having the guts to admit they had made a dumb decision to change the strip, alienating their fan base across Otago and Southland.</p>
<p>&quot;I took a stand on this issue a few months ago because I believed that changing a brand was a big step and shouldn&#39;t have been contemplated without consultation with the community,&quot; Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Highlanders are part of the proud tradition of Otago and Southland, 127 years of history can&#39;t be tossed out overnight.</p>
<p>&quot;The Highlanders already have an identity. They&#39;ve got a support base. There&#39;s compelling reason to retain the blue and gold of Otago, the maroon of Southland and the purple and gold of North Otago.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m pleased that Highlanders CEO Roger Clark has said that public feedback on the proposed green strip and the need for a neutral process for choosing a new colour had prompted this decision.</p>
<p>&quot;I agree with him that whatever the difference of opinion the ORFU had with some members of our community - what is blatantly clear is that we all want what&#39;s best for the franchise, and we want a successful, winning rugby team.</p>
<p>&quot;I look forward to offering whatever support I can to the ORFU and the Highlanders in the coming season. Now we can all focus on a good outcome for the All Blacks in the Rugby World Cup,&quot; Clare Curran said.</p>
