<h3>Greens call for sustainable Christchurch rebuild on quake anniversary</h3>
<p>The first anniversary of the Canterbury earthquake should be marked by a renewed resolve for a sustainable rebuild of Christchurch funded through a fair earthquake levy, the Green party said today.</p>
<p>“The past 12 months have been extremely tough for all Cantabrians. It says a lot about the spirit of the people of this city that we have come through it so well,” said Green Party earthquake spokesperson Dr Kennedy Graham.</p>
<p>“The Canterbury situation should be declared an issue of ‘national significance’, reflecting a need for the country as a whole to support the rebuild, and to participate in it.</p>
<p>“The whole recovery should be equitably financed. A one-off special earthquake levy would guarantee the rebuild had appropriate levels of funds, and would avoid burdening the next generation with the cost of the rebuild.</p>
<p>“The Christchurch City Council has done a good job with its draft City Plan. It contains many sound ideas for a green and resilient city. The Plan parallels the Green Party’s own report quite closely.</p>
<p>“Rather than dismissing the City Plan as a ‘wish-list’ of civic dreamers, we need to encourage the creativity and insight that is reflected in its recommendations, and call upon the nation as a whole to lend support for our stricken region.</p>
<p>“We need leadership of the highest calibre – in the political, the civic and the corporate worlds, acting together for the best future for Christchurch.</p>

<p>“We need to avoid capital flight, and retain professional and skilled people for the huge reconstruction effort that lies ahead.</p>
<p>“Today, above all, we must remember those who lost their lives on 22 February, and their loved ones who are missing them most especially on this day,” said Dr Graham.</p>
<p>“The best way we can honour them is to succeed in the recovery of the region and the rebuild of our city, and make it the most vibrant, exciting and pleasant place where people want to live.</p>
<p>“Let that resolve be the legacy of 4 September 2010,” said Dr Graham.</p>
