<p><strong>Friday, 2 September 2011, 2:31 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>ACT Solutions Needed Urgently—Brash</strong></p>
<p>A new report showing just over half of the 200,000 New Zealand children living below the poverty line are Maori and Pacific Islanders is a further vindication of ACT policies and pointer to how urgently they are needed, says ACT New Zealand leader Dr Don Brash.</p>
<p>The report, commissioned by a coalition of child advocacy organisations called Every Child Counts, has found that &#39;&#39;a combination of high dependency on welfare benefits, high rates of single parenthood, and a concentration of workers in the manufacturing industries keep Maori and Pasifika families trapped in poverty.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;ACT has been saying since its inception that welfare dependency, particularly dependency on the sole parent benefit, creates a poverty trap that has ensnared Maori and Pacific Islanders in disproportionately high numbers,&quot; says Dr Brash.</p>
<p>&quot;The solution, however, is not more of the same policies that created the problem.</p>
<p>It is not, as the Greens have already demanded in their knee-jerk response to the report, higher benefits and a higher minimum wage.</p>
<p>&quot;Nor is it, as report co-author Hone Kaa has demanded, a shift away from what he calls &#39;a Pakeha approach&#39;—whatever that might be—to the problem of a &#39;brown underclass.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;Poverty is no respecter of race. Nor are its cures. There are approaches that work and approaches that don&#39;t.</p>
<p>&quot;Another one that won&#39;t work is a government task force, such as Dr Kaa is also seeking, likely to be stacked with politically correct lobbyists with a separatist agenda.</p>

<p>&quot;The government must press ahead with its overhaul of our welfare system, not just to get more beneficiaries into work or training, but with a view to uprooting the very culture of dependency whose disastrous results for children this report so tragically highlights.</p>
<p>&quot;It ought also to reinstate youth rates and thus pave the way into work for thousands of youngsters currently condemned to the dole because employers can&#39;t afford to take them on.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t want to see an underclass of any colour. I don&#39;t want to see any children of any race living below the poverty line. With that in mind I&#39;ll be delivering a major speech on the entire subject of welfare reform in the near future,&quot; Dr Brash concludes.</p>
