<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strong line-up for 12th Bluegreens Forum</strong></p>
<p>National’s Bluegreens gathered this weekend in Akaroa for their 12th annual forum with important announcements scheduled to be made by Ministers of Finance, Environment and Conservation.</p>
<p>“Bluegreens were founded over a decade ago by a group of motivated New Zealanders who support strong economic policy and growth but want this carefully married with policies that protect New Zealand’s natural environment”, National’s Bluegreen Convenor Andrew von Dadelszen said.</p>
<p>“We worked hard in the past decade on developing an innovative set of ideas to advance better environmental management and which would support a growing economy. We are excited about the opportunity to put these ideas into practice in Government. We are looking forward to announcements by Ministers and MPs over the weekend on air quality, green growth, biodiversity, marine conservation, the future of the McKenzie and on reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.”</p>
<p>“We will be exploring new ideas on the future over the weekend with panel discussions on water, green business, the coast and oceans and climate change.”</p>
<p>“We appreciate the participation and input from Ngai Tahu, the Land and Water Forum, Greenpeace, the Canterbury Chamber of Commerce, the Environment Defence Society and the chair of the UN Kyoto Protocol Negotiations, Adrian Macey.”</p>
<p>“The Bluegreens are a policy advisory group of the New Zealand National Party founded in 1998 so that in the MMP environment National’s thinking and policy on environment and conservation issues would be strengthened.”</p>
