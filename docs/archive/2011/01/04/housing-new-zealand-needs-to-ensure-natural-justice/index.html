<p>4 January 2011 <strong>Media Statement<br>Housing New Zealand Needs to ensure natural justice</strong></p>
<p>Labour Housing spokesperson Moana Mackey says the dismissal of fraud charges against three state house tenants who were subsequently evicted from their homes has highlighted major flaws in Housing New Zealand&#39;s processes.</p>
<p>Details released to The Press under the Official Information Act have shown that since January 2009 three Housing New Zealand tenants in Canterbury evicted based on fraud accusations were later cleared of all charges in court.</p>
<p>“Housing New Zealand were questioned about their processes for dealing with fraud at their financial review in December before Parliament&#39;s Social Services select committee,” Moana Mackey said.</p>
<p>“Housing New Zealand was questioned at length about whether or not its processes allowed for natural justice. This was the result of tenants who had contacted opposition MPs out of desperation because they claimed that not only were the allegations false, but that they weren&#39;t even allowed to know what evidence the corporation had against them.”</p>
<p>“Despite a room packed with officials, the Chief Executive and Chair were unable to answer this very simple question.”</p>
<p>“Housing New Zealand promised they would get back to the committee at a later date with the information.</p>
<p>”Anyone caught defrauding the corporation must take responsibility and face the full consequences of their actions.</p>

<p>“No one is defending those tenants who break the rules . With so many on the waiting list, and a Government which has slashed funding for new state houses back to the bone, tenants who deliberately mislead the corporation about their circumstances should expect to be discovered and dealt with appropriately,” Moana Mackey said.</p>
<p>“However there has to be the opportunity for a tenant who has been falsely accused to defend themselves against these allegations before they are evicted. It&#39;s only fair.”</p>
<p>“If Housing New Zealand had simply waited for the legal processes to be concluded before issuing the 90 day notices, then much of the problem could have been avoided.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately under this National Government fairness and due process are no longer high priorities,” Moana Mackey said.  </p>
