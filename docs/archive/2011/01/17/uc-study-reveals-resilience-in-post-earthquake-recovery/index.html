<h3>First preliminary report in University of Canterbury longitudinal study reveals resilience in post- earthquake recovery</h3>
<p>University of Canterbury researchers looking into the factors that influence the ability of organisations to recover from disasters have discovered that, as of mid-November, 93 per cent of respondents had not made any staff redundant in the wake of Canterbury’s 4 September earthquake.</p>
<p>“In fact, we found that 25 per cent of respondents had taken on more staff in the wake of the earthquake,” said co-leader of the Resilient Organisations Research Programme in UC’s Department of Accounting and Information Systems, Dr John Vargo.</p>
<p>Two hundred and seventy-nine organisations had responded to the UC survey so far with responses continuing to be received. The survey itself is part of an 18-month longitudinal study being undertaken by Dr Vargo, Dr Erica Seville (Civil Engineering), Dr Tom Wilson (Geological Sciences) and three PhD students.<br>Respondents revealed a generally positive view towards insurance cover. “Most respondents were neutral to very satisfied with how well their insurance package met their expectations.”</p>
<p>The most cited factors that helped mitigate or lessen the impact of the earthquake to organisations included well-designed and well-built buildings, an organisation’s relationship with its staff, available cash or credit, water, sewage, electricity, and communications being restored quickly or not interrupted, and the organisation’s relationship with its suppliers.</p>

<p>Many organisations found that intangible aspects of the process of recovering from the earthquake event took the greatest toll, rather than infrastructure and essential services.</p>
<p>“These preliminary results illustrate that physical damage is not, in many cases, the most disruptive effect of the 4 September earthquake. Influences outside of an organisation’s direct control, such as damage to nearby organisations and electricity supply disruption are contributing factors.”<br>In an open-ended question, respondents were asked to identify the biggest challenge for running their organisation so far in the aftermath of the earthquake. 26 per cent cited employees and their wellbeing.</p>
<p>The UC researchers will be undertaking more in-depth analysis of the survey results once data collection is complete. The study’s findings will then be used to provide advice to government policy makers and others interested in appropriate and effective pre-disaster and post-disaster business support.</p>
<p>The longitudinal study will continue to capture the evolution and adaptation of organisations as they respond to the consequences of the earthquake and subsequent aftershocks over the next 18 months.</p>
<p>“Much more needs to be known about how organisations have been and will continue to be affected by the 4 September earthquake, including understanding the link between pre-earthquake performance and an organisation’s resilience in a crisis and identifying how organisations influence each other’s recovery within the spatial context of an urban environment.”</p>
