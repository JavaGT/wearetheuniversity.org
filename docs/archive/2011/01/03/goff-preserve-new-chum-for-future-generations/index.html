<p><strong>Monday, 3 January 2011, 6:51 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Goff - Preserve New Chum for future generations</p>
<p>Labour Leader Phil Goff today called on Prime Minister John Key to match the developers&#39; offer of meeting half the cost of passing ownership of land behind New Chum beach into New Zealand&#39;s conservation estate.</p>
<p>&quot;New Chum beach looks much as it did when Kupe arrived in New Zealand. It is one of the last remaining untouched and unspoiled areas of our coastline,&quot; Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>&quot;For New Chum to be subdivided into 20 lots and built on would be desecration of a beach described by Lonely Planet and National Geographic as on of the most beautiful beaches in the world,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We can save New Chum beach in its untouched state for our children, our grandchildren and future generations, and today hundreds of New Zealanders at Matarangi called for that to happen.</p>
<p>&quot;For a small investment, probably around $10million from the Crown, we can protect not only a beautiful heritage area, but also an important icon in New Zealand&#39;s branding of being clean, green and 100% pure.</p>
<p>&quot;When National can invest $1.7billion in protecting South Canterbury Finance investors and pay Warner Brothers up To $95million in handouts for Filming the Hobbit in New Zealand, $10million is a small price to pay for protecting such an invaluable asset as New Chum beach,&quot; Phil Goff said.</p>
