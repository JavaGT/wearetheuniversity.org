<p><strong>Monday, January 31, 2011</strong><br><strong>Vet students gather on campus</strong></p>
<p>Veterinary students from across Australia and New Zealand have spent the past week at the Manawatu campus for the annual Australasian Veterinary Students’ conference.</p>
<p>The conference, in its 51st year, brings together students to engage in academic and social events.</p>
<p>This year’s event was organised by fifth-year students Shelly Hann and Sarah Briggs.</p>
<p>Ms Briggs says that as the only New Zealand students to attend last year’s conference in Townsville, they knew what they were getting themselves into when they took on the role. “We knew what was involved in setting the conference up, and wanted to make sure it was done right when it came back to New Zealand,” she says.</p>
<p>The week included a series of lectures and workshops, including sessions on small animal orthopaedics, bovine surgical skills and equine neurology. However, the conference was not all work, with a field trip to Wellington and various social events.</p>
<p>The conference also provided the opportunity for networking, which provides the final year students with work opportunities. “We’ve met some really awesome people,” Ms Hann says. “I’ve also got some good contacts now, and I’ll be heading to Australia in the future to do some practice work that’s come out of those contacts.”</p>
<p>Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences head Professor Frazer Allan says the conference was an ideal opportunity for students to network. “Developing these contacts is vital for young vets as they embark on a career,” Professor Allan says. “But the conference also gives Massey the opportunity to showcase its expertise and facilities to the future vets of Australasia – many of whom will be looking for ongoing training in the future.”</p>
