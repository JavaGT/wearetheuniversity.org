<p><strong>Monday, 24 January 2011, 11:45 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Young_Nationals">New Zealand Young Nationals</a></strong></p>
<p>Tolley leads charge for choice and change</p>
<p>The New Zealand Young Nationals applaud the leadership of the Minister of Education, Anne Tolley for acknowledging the freedom of one of New Zealand’s top schools to choose an academic pathway in the interests of its students.</p>
<p>“Her leadership dawns a new culture of choice, openness and accountability in our nation’s education system so we can have outcomes that enable all students the opportunity to succeed” says Young Nats Vice President, Zach Castles.</p>
<p>The Young Nationals reject calls by Kate Gainsford and her PPTA/Labour colleagues that schools should be ‘sacked’ for simply seeking to offer the best for their students.</p>
<p>The Young Nationals believe that if the only interests of PPTA/Labour are to constantly undermine education through pointless strikes and endless backbiting, then such does not warrant the time of day.</p>
<p>“The freedom to choose is a fundamental human right. Our government is listening to the students and parents that our education system serves.”</p>
<p>In election year, New Zealanders can be confident in a minister who has a different vision - a vision of students who perform, succeed and are rewarded, where parents and teachers do have input in getting the best outcomes. Her leadership in supporting Auckland Grammar reflects this.</p>
