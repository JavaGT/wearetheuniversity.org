<p>Counter-Protest to Support St Heliers Development</p>
<p>ACT on Campus are taking to the streets in a counter-protest in St Heliers, to support property rights and to oppose the Environment Court&#39;s injunction against the new development on Turua Street.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT on Campus support the property rights of all New Zealanders, including developers,&quot; says ACT on Campus President, Peter McCaffrey&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mike Markham, the owner of the Turua Street properties, has already suffered through more than five years of long delays while struggling through a minefield of bureaucracy and red-tape, including voluntarily delaying the demolition while the Mayor and Council looked at the issue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Property rights are a fundamental part of a modern liberal society and should be defended by the state, not attacked and restricted.&quot; says McCaffrey</p>
<p>&quot;In the current economic climate, thousands of people are out of work or struggling just to get by. Development and progress creates jobs and wealth while regulations and restrictions will put even more people out of work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just because one person likes the look of a house should not give them complete veto rights over something the owner of the property wishes to do. If the local community want to protect the houses, they should band together to purchase them from the developer rather than try to steal them through regulation and government force.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Environment Court should immediately withdraw its injunction, allow the development to proceed, and refocus its attention on real environmental issues affecting New Zealand.&quot; says ACT on Campus President, Peter McCaffrey.</p>
