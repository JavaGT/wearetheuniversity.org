<p><strong>Conference to debate sport and alcohol</strong></p>
<p>The relationship between sport and alcohol will be debated at a conference at Massey’s Albany campus next month.</p>
<p><em>Sport and Alcohol: Finding the Balance</em> will bring together speakers from sciences, social sciences, public health, liquor enforcement, local government, injury prevention, business and other stakeholder groups to discuss the ways alcohol and sport interact. The conference runs from February 9-11.</p>
<p>School of Sport and Exercise head Associate Professor Steve Stannard says the relationship between alcohol and sport is complex. “At a physiological level alcohol intake has an impact upon a sportsperson’s ability to perform,” he says. “Our staff will present some recent findings related to the effect alcohol has on performance.</p>
<p>“But the role that the alcohol industry plays in promoting, funding and supporting sportspeople and sporting clubs is also a complex issue. We hope to bring together a panel of speakers that can investigate if we can find the balance in the relationship.”</p>
<p>Dr Stannard hopes the conference will spark a balanced debate. “While alcohol consumption can have a detrimental effect on performance and recovery there are also some societal issues,” he says.<br>“The question that needs to be asked is where the balance lies between a healthy, happy, functioning sports environment and the role of alcohol consumption and sponsorship. Every sports administrator whose organisation is reliant on alcohol sponsorship needs to be at this conference.”</p>

<p>Speakers include Centre for Social Health Outcomes Research and Evaluation head Professor Sally Casswell, who will speak on international evidence relating to alcohol sponsorship in sport. Other speakers include Kypros Kypri from University of Newcastle in Australia, and Wigram MP Jim Anderton, who has advocated for tighter controls on the sale and promotion of alcohol.</p>
<p>Alcohol Advisory Council of New Zealand chief executive Gerard Vaughan says the council is pleased to support the conference and looks forward to discussion and debate about the many facets of alcohol and sport in New Zealand. “There are challenges in this area that need to be worked through, and there are also a lot of really good things happening,” Mr Vaughan says.</p>
<p>“We were really pleased with the high level of response from people to the call for presentations. The conference will be an excellent forum to generate and build on initiatives to reduce alcohol harm in the sports area. It’ll be a great opportunity for people interested in alcohol and sport to come and share their work and learn more,” he says.</p>
