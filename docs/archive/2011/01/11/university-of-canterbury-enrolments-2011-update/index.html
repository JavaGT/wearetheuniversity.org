<h3>University of Canterbury Enrolments 2011 Update</h3>
<p>“The University of Canterbury welcomes applications from qualified students and our philosophy is to be open to as many qualified students as possible for as long as possible,” said UC Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr prior to release of NCEA results tomorrow (subs 12 January).</p>
<p>“Whilst some courses at UC have historically had restricted entry such as teacher education, law, and engineering others such as commerce and arts have had places for all those qualified to enter.”</p>
<p>UC is currently processing enrolment applications from all prospective domestic first-year undergraduate students who applied before the deadline of 10 December and will shortly be generating offers to that cohort of students based on their NCEA results.</p>
<p>Some late applications have been received from prospective domestic first-year undergraduate students and those who sent in late applications prior to Christmas will know the outcome of their late application to enrol by 31 January.</p>
<p>Meanwhile returning students have until 7 days prior to their official course start date to apply to continue their studies at UC, with most classes commencing on 21 February. Returning students are urged to submit their application to enrol as early as possible so as to expedite the enrolment process.</p>
<p>In the event that more students wish to study at UC than there are funded places for, UC will select students in line with the Education Act, the Government’s Tertiary Education Strategy and UC’s Investment Plan, as agreed with the Tertiary Education Commission.</p>

<p>Dr Carr said that entry may be restricted to prevent the quality of the learning environment from being eroded either by spreading resources too thinly or by accepting poorly-qualified students with low probabilities of success at UC.</p>
<p>“In 2011 we are providing additional advice to students over 20 years of age and without UE, or its equivalent, to ensure those with a high likelihood of success are making the right choice in coming to UC and others are directed to options that might better prepare them to succeed at University level study.</p>
<p>“Some students have been advised to enrol in courses to earn a Certificate of Proficiency (COP) rather than initially signing up for a full degree programme. COP courses are the same courses as degree courses, taught in the same classes by the same people at the same time as degree courses and passes can be credited toward degrees once satisfactory performance at university level study has been proven. This means that the student enrols in a series of papers rather than committing to a full degree programme of study at the start.”</p>
<p>International students have until 7 days prior to the official start date of their course to enrol at UC.</p>
