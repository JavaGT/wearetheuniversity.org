<p>MEDIA RELEASE 7 April 2011</p>
<p>Eco bling not enough</p>
<p>The changes needed before New Zealand is using its fair share of the earth’s resources are far greater than most people realise say two Victoria University sustainability researchers.</p>
<p>Robert and Brenda Vale, professors at Victoria University’s School of Architecture, are partway through a three-year research project exploring what New Zealand would be like if communities and individuals reduced their footprint to a sustainable level. The research is funded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation.</p>
<p>The Vales use an internationally accepted technique called The Ecological Footprint, which measures the area of productive land and water the population needs to maintain its activities and absorb waste in a sustainable way. At current population levels, each person in the world needs 1.8 hectares.</p>
<p>Currently, New Zealanders use about five hectares each, Americans between eight and nine, Chinese around two and people in many other countries, like Indonesia and Vietnam, just one.</p>
<p>The Vales will be working with communities in Central Otago and Manukau to explore scenarios for reducing resource use, gauge attitudes and discuss how changes might be implemented.</p>
<p>But, they say, a study carried out by Carmeny Field, a Masters student working with them, has highlighted some of the changes that might be needed in the future. Among other things, she looked at the transport footprint of people living in Wellington in the 1950s compared to today’s residents.</p>

<p>Professor Brenda Vale says the level of mobility people now expect to have is taxing on resources.</p>
<p>“Back in the 50s, people didn’t travel much. They didn’t fly, only used their car at the weekends and mostly walked, cycled and used public transport.</p>
<p>“And the interesting thing is that most of those interviewed thought life was pretty good back then. Having more doesn’t necessarily make us better off.” Professor Vale says much more is needed than a bit of “eco bling”.</p>
<p>“People think they can put a rainwater tank on their roof or install solar heating and then carry on their lifestyle as normal, but the changes required are much more far reaching than that.”</p>
<p>Professor Robert Vale says New Zealand needs more visionary thinking. “China, for example, is much further ahead than us in its thinking. They are connecting their cities with a network of high speed electric trains and building a high speed link to Europe, which will reduce the need to fly.</p>
<p>“It is more difficult for New Zealand because we are small and geographically isolated, but there is plenty we could do such as feeding ourselves, generating our own power and growing bio fuels. People aren’t thinking long term and they need to be.”</p>
