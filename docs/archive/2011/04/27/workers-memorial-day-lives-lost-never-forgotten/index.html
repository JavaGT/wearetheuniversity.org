<h3>Workers’ Memorial Day- lives lost never forgotten</h3>
<p>Workers who have lost their lives or been injured on the job will not be forgotten, says Labour’s spokesperson for Labour Issues Darien Fenton.</p>
<p>Darien Fenton will speak tomorrow at the Workers’ Memorial Day service in Christchurch.</p>
<p>“This year’s memorial will be especially emotional following February’s tragic quake. But we will also remember the tragic loss of 29 men who were killed last year at Pike River Mine, whose families are still struggling to find closure.</p>
<p>“Workers Memorial Day is a time to remember those workers who have needlessly died, been injured or made ill while at work,” Darien Fenton said.</p>
<p>“But it’s also a day to fight for the living by campaigning for better workplace health and safety, fairer laws, and better rights for workers.</p>
<p>“New Zealand still loses around two workers per week to workplace accidents, despite tougher laws and penalties. Many more are injured and thousands suffer long lasting illnesses.</p>
<p>“Many of these deaths and injuries are easily preventable, but sadly some employers see workplace health and safety as a compliance cost – one to be at best tolerated, and at worst, circumvented.</p>
<p>“The reality is we have a government more dedicated to selling off our world class ACC scheme to private business than investing in the prevention of more deaths and injuries at work.</p>

<p>“Workers continue to bear the brunt of government’s cuts; with those with workplace hearing loss paying a high price as support for hearing aids is removed.</p>
<p>“Keeping workers healthy and safe at work is about taking care of the people we work with, and the people who help create the wealth of our country, not about the bottom line.”<br>Darien Fenton says she is concerned that tight economic conditions could mean businesses will take more shortcuts and workers will pay the consequences.</p>
<p>“I’m also concerned about workers access to their unions, especially where health and safety is involved, and the effects of ‘fire at will’ legislation implemented on 1 April.</p>
<p>“In Christchurch, we must be particularly vigilant as businesses build up again, many from scratch. The health and safety of workers must not be compromised in the process of getting Christchurch back on its feet.</p>
<p>“Labour will continue the fight for safer workplaces. We owe it to those whom we mourn today. They must never be forgotten,” Darien Fenton said.</p>
