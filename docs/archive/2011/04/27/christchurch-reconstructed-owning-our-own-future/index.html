<p>Hon Lianne Dalziel<br>MP for Christchurch East<br>Fabians Society<br>Wednesday 27th April 2011<br>St John’s Church Hall, Cnr Dixon &amp; Willis Sts<br>5.30pm</p>
<h3>Christchurch Reconstructed: Owning Our Own Future</h3>
<p>I have spoken often of my longstanding fear of earthquakes being firmly located in Wellington. The earthquakes that rocked my home town of Christchurch first on 4 September last year and now 22 February this year have not relocated that fear. I just have two cities where I don’t sleep as easy as I used to.</p>
<p>So despite the location, I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to speak. And that is because it is difficult to speak out in Christchurch itself. Every attempt to give voice to valid concerns is characterised as ‘politicising’ what has been a tragedy of almost unimaginable proportions. Those who express concerns are labeled unfeeling for the lives lost or ungrateful for the incredible response effort. And it was incredible. New Zealand’s capacity to respond to a disaster is world-class; our response meets international best practice and the call for volunteers and donations is always answered in spades; a phrase with particular resonance on this occasion.</p>
<p>But response is only the beginning of what is a much longer journey after a disaster; and what happens in the response phase impacts on that journey to recovery. That’s why the recovery phase begins immediately after response kicks in – after the first earthquake, standard recovery processes were in place within 48 hours. The recovery process is designed to run parallel to the response effort and transitions to the lead role when the response phase is over.<br>And that’s what didn’t happen in October last year – the response phase came to an end and the recovery process was wound down instead of taking over. What went wrong provides the basis for one of the lessons we must learn from Christchurch, so that we can ensure that it does not happen again.</p>

<p>I will come back to what went wrong in a minute, but I want to talk about the nature of the main message I want you to take from here tonight. Essentially Christchurch doesn’t want its earthquake legacy to be the reason why other parts of New Zealand were held back in delivering on their plans to invest with the government in their infrastructure or the reason why the government was forced to sell assets. Christchurch wants our earthquake legacy to be a powerful message of recovery leading to new opportunities that makes us more resilient and more sustainable than we were before – and that is a legacy we want to share with the rest of New Zealand, so that the costs of rebuilding our city become an investment in our future as a nation. Peter Harris is going to propose a model of meeting the cost – my contribution tonight challenges us to turn that cost into an opportunity.</p>
<p>First to what has really been happening in Christchurch and what happens to those who dare to challenge the government or the City Council. ‘A slippage on the graciousness front’ was how Jane Clifton described my ‘burst through the compassion cordon’. ‘Help for her electorate wasn’t good enough or quick enough and everybody needed more money, not less, was the gist of her outburst’, she said. For the record I actually said we needed food not cash, because money meant nothing to people when all the shops, supermarkets and petrol stations had been closed by the earthquake, something completely overlooked by the powers that be. And then followed the government line they have used to shut down those of us who dare to disturb the narrative: “Realistically, it’s hard to imagine quicker or more thorough work by those rescuing people, shoring up damage, restoring infrastructure, clearing silt and rubble and generally mucking in….Everyone has been doing his or her absolute best; even the experts are telling us our best is about as good as it gets.”</p>
<p>Of course she is referencing response; not recovery where international best practice had been stopped in its tracks within weeks of the first earthquake. She then goes on to say that I am almost certainly not guilty of political opportunism, but then says: “Everyone in Christchurch has reached breaking point. When you’re running on empty emotionally and always braced for the next aftershock, lashing out is a hard impulse to curb.” This is pure government spin and a shame to see it repeated by a respected columnist. Not everyone in Christchurch has reached breaking point, least of all me, but this government has much to answer for in terms of my constituents who have reached breaking point through the government’s multiple failures that have left so many people uninformed, disconnected, frightened, mistrusting, angry and feeling overwhelmed and overlooked.</p>
<p>So what went wrong when we have such a world-class Civil Defence &amp; Emergency Management (CDEM) regime in place? What happened was that the government managed to render inactive the very part of the template that was designed to automate the recovery process and the transition from response to recovery when it set up the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Commission (CERC). The legislation creating CERC was introduced under urgency, 10 days after the first earthquake, as part of the emergency legislation, which means it did not even have a regulatory impact statement prepared; which in turn means its design benefited neither from detailed analysis of recovery best practice nor from the scrutiny and feedback from experts that consultation would have provided. This inadequate process led to added confusion about who was meant to be doing what, and effectively unraveled the recovery planning processes that were already in place. It wasn’t deliberate, but it was negligent. And then the Christchurch City Council topped the government on the negligence stakes by failing to take over the role of leading the recovery as the CDEM regime required and decided to operate ‘business as usual’ processes effectively stalling Christchurch’s rebuilding effort as well. Nothing happened to advance our recovery from the moment CERC was up and running and the government let it happen.</p>
<p>The February earthquake saw CERC morph into the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) which at least saw the Cabinet Papers referencing international best practice. Unfortunately the government either misunderstood or ignored that advice and ended up simply replacing a powerless layer of bureaucracy capable of nothing more than making recommendations to the government and coordinating the work of the various agencies with a powerful bureaucracy installed as a fully-fledged government department located in Christchurch but controlled from Wellington by a Minister who still does not understand even the basics of recovery and who believes that community consultation simply stands in the way of decision-making and action. So just who is being political?</p>
<p>And as for the Christchurch City Council – their incompetence is not to be exposed as part of the deal, with the government quietly contracting the EQC’s consultants to undertake the revision of the city plan’s management of flood risk, which the Council should have done after the first earthquake and which has led to the paralysis evident to the south but not the north of the Waimakariri River. I have chosen that boundary line because it separates the Christchurch City Council from the Waimakariri District Council, which has already informed their communities of who is doing what, when, how and why. And because they have truly engaged with their community since the first earthquake, there is a high degree of trust and acceptance – even those who will wait the longest applauded the council’s announcement. At least they know where they stand and they know why. And meanwhile back in Christchurch, armed with the coveted leadership role in the design of the CBD’s recovery plan and the infrastructure rebuild, the Christchurch City Council has happily endorsed a recovery model that is the antithesis of international best practice and potentially alienates from the process the very communities to whom they owe their mandate to sit at the Council table. And the communities that sit on the properties near the south bank of the Waimakariri River, that experienced comparatively little extra damage in the second earthquake as was the case on the north bank, continue to wait not understanding that their Council has left them high and dry – figuratively in this case as opposed to literally, which is the problem in a nutshell.<br>But it is not surprising that the government wants to brush this all under the table – afterall if the people of New Zealand really knew what had been happening in Christchurch then the election narrative the spin doctors are writing for Mr Key now may have a hollow ring in November. That’s why those of us who are advocating for a better way are demonised or trivialised and when all else fails marginalised as emotional train wrecks.</p>
<p>Government spin may influence what people outside the particularly affected communities observe, but it doesn’t minimise the reality that so many now face heading into our first winter in damaged homes, on damaged streets, with some of our suburbs’ very future now in doubt. There is a litany of failures that have combined to drain away what is the lifeblood of a community in recovery and that lifeblood is hope for the future. We need safe, warm, secure homes to get us through the immediate time ahead and we need to know if we are not going to be able to rebuild where we live now. But our communities also need to be inspired and we need to believe that life is going to get better. We need milestones that enable us to celebrate along the way because it is going to be a long, slow, arduous journey – and we know there will be setbacks along the way. And we also need to know that our ‘new kind of normal’ is going to be better than ‘getting back to normal’ would ever be – because that is now lost to us forever. And most importantly we need to know that we can each contribute something of value and that we will be heard so that we can truly own our own recovery and own our own future.</p>
<p>In my optimistic moments I believe this could still happen – and that is if the government chooses for CERA an inspirational leader in the true sense of the word, and then gives him or her, the degree of flexibility a board would give a chief executive to achieve the desired results. Such a person would have to be free to devolve recovery planning down to the affected communities so that we can tap the wealth of local knowledge that lies within them and so that we can get everything on the table, including all the potential opportunities that must emerge from the disaster if we are to add any meaning to it at all.<br>And the approach must be truly apolitical – using MPs, councilors, community board members and leaders from community groups, residents’ associations, churches, sports clubs and businesses – as partners in recovery not political risks to be managed.</p>
<p>Sadly I am not alone in thinking that the government has deliberately chosen a government department over an independent crown entity to ensure that they are calling the shots, making the hard decisions, being seen to be getting things done and carefully controlling the dissemination of information in election year. I am sure that the spin doctors are already writing the narrative for the government’s re-election campaign, which will be designed to achieve the mandate they said they would seek for a further term. We know selected items of expenditure are being whisked off this year’s Budget in Canterbury’s name. And there’s a whole new category of ‘nice to haves’ which is code for cuts to the popular policies introduced by the previous government. And of course this Budget will lay the groundwork for the mandate to sell our assets and they plan to use my city as an excuse.</p>
<p>My message is that there is an alternative. And it is one which has much to offer Christchurch, but what is even better is that it has much to offer New Zealand as well. The source of my vision is the disaster recovery process, which speaks to me of what has been missing from this government’s approach not only since the first earthquake, but actually since the last election as it has failed to address the economic crisis that recession has levelled at us.</p>
<p>Returning to the international experience, much has been written about the New Orleans post Katrina story, but the most compelling analysis for me was one that identified the missing story – understanding what was going on in New Orleans pre-Katrina. This invites an analysis of the historic choices that left New Orleans vulnerable to what occurred – pre-existing patterns of physical development, issues of public risk and levels of community resilience, all wrapped up in the overarching issue of sustainability. By ignoring the third story in the recovery process pre-event vulnerabilities were simply re-entrenched.<br>It also meant that vulnerable communities were further marginalised as against those powerful interests who always have access to the corridors of power and who have in many cases invested considerably in the status quo – which is why ‘business as usual’ is anathema to genuine recovery. These are serious issues for Christchurch and I intend to explore them in more detail once the government announces who they will appoint to what positions and who they select to be consulted on the recovery strategy and recovery plans. There are high stakes in play depending on who owns what in terms of residential and commercial development opportunities under the councils’ existing plans and strategies; and it will be important to ensure that those interests are not given precedence over the needs of our residential communities. This is where the fourth estate is going to have to be vigilant so that transparency is assured given the potential for hidden connections between the various interests, the power brokers and the powers that be.</p>
<p>But let me for now take this disaster recovery approach across to another context, because this is where Christchurch could have something to offer New Zealand – and turn the cost of the rebuild into an investment for the future. Let’s just apply the Katrina lessons to the economy and begin by identifying our pre-recession vulnerabilities; followed by a consideration of how we use the disaster to future-proof our economy to address these in a way that is sustainable and builds resilience.</p>
<p>In identifying the pre-recession vulnerabilities I couldn’t help but look jealously across the Tasman and consider the impact of the four pillars - the Australian owned banks – together with the Australian Workplace Superannuation Scheme. It is true that here in New Zealand we had KiwiSaver, but as a fledgling scheme and with some of the incentives designed during periods of government surpluses, its growth potential was always going to be at risk of a different set of government priorities being applied. And applied they were – government incentives for KiwiSaver are now in the ‘nice-to-have’ category.</p>
<p>And that is the first of the pre-recession vulnerabilities – KiwiSaver simply did not have the cross-party buy-in that we see across the Tasman. And without a savings culture in New Zealand, government debt levels may have been low, but household debt was through the roof. And the roof is a good analogy because people were lured into leveraging off increased property values for a range of purposes – including investing in other properties and even buying consumer goods or overseas holidays.</p>
<p>And that takes me to other pre-recession vulnerabilities – the property boom, which priced first home buyers out of the market, while allowing others to buy two or three other properties as investments – government policies that skewed investment away from the productive sector or real economy - and a very poor level of financial literacy that saw people unable to understand let alone manage the risks to which they exposed their hard-earned money. Add to that the poor quality regulatory frameworks in the finance sector; and just to make sure you have everything on the table, a fluctuating, largely over-valued dollar that attacked our elaborately transformed manufacturing export base, as well as the amount that in-bound tourists spend while they are here, coupled with the effect of high commodity prices masking the cold, hard reality of our balance of payments crisis.</p>
<p>I thought we had a financial meltdown before – wasn’t there a stock market crash in 1987? So if the pattern of the post-crash governments for the decade that followed had been adhering to a plan that addressed all the pre-crash vulnerabilities (which bear a striking resemblance to the ones I have just listed), perhaps we would have been better prepared for what has happened now – so let’s look at what they did instead: give the Reserve Bank Governor the single target of price stability and a single tool to control it; sell assets; deregulate the labour market; reduce welfare; introduce market rents for state housing and remove the one government lever affecting private sector rents; sell assets (including state housing); coporatise the public health and education systems and outsource major components to the private sector as well as the voluntary &amp; community sector; sell assets; cut government spending; pare back the public service, devolving more to the community;<br>and then, the triumph of theory over practice, introduce the policy/operations and funder/provider splits in the name of government efficiency and get the community sector into a competitive market for commercial contracts. And what is the government doing now? As someone famously said ‘it’s deja vu all over again’.</p>
<p>My point is that all of these are short-term, opportunistic interventions that fail both tests – they are not sustainable and they do not make us resilient. You only need to look at the impact of contestable, short-term funding arrangements on community groups that need to collaborate with organisations that are their competitors. And cuts to the public sector? Many of the experiences of a lack of preparedness in Christchurch – no stockpiled emergency kits, including food and other essential supplies, to airlift into damaged suburbs; no alternative toilet or shower facilities or kitset housing on standby; no strategy to communicate directly with citizens in damaged areas – all revealed the weakness of the minimalist state writ large. It may be popular to rail against government spending – but what is the price we pay when we are forced to leave communities to fend for themselves? We did remarkably well in the eastern suburbs in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake with the hard work of community and faith based groups joining with the local police &amp; others, but we would have been better served by a fully engaged government response and that requires a well-equipped public service ready to partner with well-resourced, resilient communities. We were ready but the government was not.</p>
<p>Life is full of ironies but New Zealand’s first unplugged version of a reserve bank governor now aspires to lead the party that stands virtually alone admiring the monetarist emperor in all his finery, while the rest of us know he is naked. Which is again a deliberately chosen metaphor, because New Zealand has been stripped of every protection that any country has ever devised to protect its economic base, leaving us to have unprotected trade relations with the world at a time when we need our exporters to be leading the economic recovery.</p>
<p>This is not a call for a return to the protectionism of the past, but it is a call for a new approach to the management of our economy. Let us not condemn ourselves to repeat the failures that recent history has warned us about. We need to actually learn another Katrina lesson which is that if we are to get our economy back on track, we need a government that is prepared to plan by co-opting all of the resources available to us. But in so doing we need to balance speed and deliberation – and deliberation means more than discussion or consultation or a job summit – it involves reflection, dialogue and negotiation for decision-making. And that is because we have to reconcile the need to marshal the authority of the state &amp; the entrepreneurship of the market to rebuild quickly with the necessity to plan in an inclusive, deliberative, innovative &amp; transformative manner. In disaster recovery terms, building too quickly &amp; randomly can impose massive long term costs &amp; risks on society. And in terms of economic recovery we only need to look to our own recent history to see the burden we have had imposed on us.</p>
<p>A government controlled agenda at a talk fest called a job summit that produced a few pre-determined results – like a National cycleway – and still no plan; no milestones; no key performance indicators. The Prime Minister who promised to turbo-charge the economy has done nothing more than kick the tyres. Maybe we should have put the key in the ignition rather than the driving seat.</p>
<p>And then there was the decision to send the head of our stock exchange to seek donations for the Prime Minister’s earthquake fund from the very people that we want to know that New Zealand is open for business. I don’t blame Mark Weldon for not turning down a Prime Ministerial call for help – I blame the Prime Minister for not thinking through the consequences of the very damaging message this has sent to the world.</p>
<p>And it fails the two tests as well – it is not sustainable – we want business contracts not charity – and it does not build resilience – unshackling the potential of our high value exporters by challenging the policies that hold them back would go a long way to do that.<br>The government has put in place temporary wage subsidies that are fast running out, but what about sustainable changes the restoration of R&amp;D tax credits and accelerated depreciation; what about measures to address our over-valued dollar – these would build resilience and they wouldn’t just benefit Christchurch, they would benefit the country.</p>
<p>And what about seizing the opportunities that this disaster presents – training our young people and re-skilling those made redundant by the recession or the earthquake so that they can be part of the rebuilding effort?</p>
<p>And what about the science and engineering challenges that lie ahead rebuilding in an area that is confronted by new seismic risks? Our Universities &amp; technology businesses could be specifically tasked with developing a programme of applied research that capitalises on our world-class status in this field.</p>
<p>And what about sustainability in terms of the decisions we make about where and how we build in the future and how we protect the environment from the new risks that have been exposed in the earthquakes? There are opportunities to make our city much more liveable as well as safer. We could become an international showcase for the future if we are given the chance.</p>
<p>And given that here in New Zealand we have world-class experts on disaster recovery and building resilience in organisations and communities – why don’t we equip the affected communities with the skills they need to own their own recovery, leaving them with the legacy of confidence and self-reliance? And then why don’t we take these skills out to other communities in our country to prepare them for the kind of disaster we have experienced?</p>
<p>These are just some of the ideas – and all they are designed to do is show that there is a better way.<br>What has happened in Christchurch is a disaster - but it does present us with the chance to become more resilient as a city and as a country. And rather than see Christchurch blamed for the re-imposition of a failed economic prescription and the sale of our country and our city’s assets, our legacy could serve as a symbol of how we can turn disaster into opportunity, sustainably secure our economic recovery as a nation and own our own future once more.</p>
