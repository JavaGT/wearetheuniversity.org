<p>Health spokesperson</p>
<p>13 April 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Ryall fails the young with arbitrary health cuts</strong></p>
<p>Cutting health services for 4500 young people, shows Health Minister Tony Ryall has taken his eye of the ball in health, Labour Health spokesperson Grant Robertson says.</p>
<p>“Cutting the funding that ensures that 4500 high school students in Auckland have access to frontline health services in their schools is ridiculous. This cut means the students will no longer receive proactive health care and health promotion services,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
<p>“Tony Ryall has become so fixated on slogans and manufactured health targets that he has totally lost sight of the point of health services. Health services are meant to help keep people well, not just be the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff that is needed once people are so sick they need hospital care.</p>
<p>“It is also apparent given that the Government has already announced cuts in funding in next month’s budget that more frontline health services will soon end up on the scrap heap.</p>
<p>“Under a National Government we have seen the cost of afterhours care rise, home help for elderly cut, cuts to mental health and public health, MidCentral DHB closed its cancer treatment waiting lists to some patients and now frontline health services for young people are being scrapped.</p>
<p>“Health Minister Tony Ryall needs to step up now and ensure that primary health services are funded properly,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
