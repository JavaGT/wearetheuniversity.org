<p>Christchurch Earthquake bulletin edition 24</p>
<p>The Labour Party&#39;s Christchurch electorate MPs, Clayton Cosgrove (Waimakariri), Ruth Dyson (Port Hills), Lianne Dalziel (Christchurch East) and Brendon Burns (Christchurch Central) have started a regular bulletin to keep people in their electorates and media informed about what is happening at grass roots level.</p>
<p>CLAYTON COSGROVE: I am in Wellington today for the introduction of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority legislation. Labour is committed to getting this legislation passed by a process which is centred on the people of Canterbury. This legislation intimately involves their lives, and their interests need to be at the centre of this debate. Our level of support past the select committee will depend on whether the Government follows through on its promise to approach this in a bi-partisan way. We have proposed a number of amendments following consultation with constituents in Canterbury and based on international best practice for recovery models. These amendments work towards an authority where there is a &#39;bit more distance from the Minister and a bit more transparency and accountability&#39;. We won&#39;t drag things out --- that would be inappropriate-but we are committed to getting this right for Canterbury and for New Zealand.</p>
<p>RUTH DYSON: Last night&#39;s community meeting for Mt Pleasant residents was very well attended with hundreds of people turning up to debate the community&#39;s future. It emphasises to me how organised and able our communities are. Debates were positive with the focus largely around how people could get involved and have their say following the introduction of the CERA legislation. Many were concerned with the extraordinary power Gerry Brownlee has delegated to himself and his handpicked community board. Another emotive issue was the miscommunication around waste, which had families flushing toilets once water was restored, not realising that this meant sewerage was being pumped into our beloved estuary. Residents from Ferrymead to Taylors Mistake may have made different decisions around waste disposal had they known that their sewerage was being pumped into the neighbouring estuary. Environmental concerns will remain high on this coastal community&#39;s agenda. This week I will be in Wellington for the introduction of the CERA legislation. I look forward to what I hope will be a bi-partisan debate focused on achieving the best outcome for the people of Canterbury.</p>

<p>LIANNE DALZIEL: Last night I co-hosted a community briefing with my colleague Brendon Burns at the St Albans Baptist Church, the first of our community briefings since the second earthquake. I am following up on the confusion around EQC / insurance issues particularly in relation to the second earthquake causing significantly more damage than the first. As they are two separate claims it is not yet clear how this will be dealt with in terms of who will do what and how the two excesses will be applied. I have advocated for a &#39;seamless&#39; approach so that the homeowners are not caught up in the complexity of reinsurance rules and the like. I will be reporting on the follow up to this as soon as I have answers. Following increasing concerns around transport safety and speed, the police have introduced reduced speed limits on earthquake damaged roads in eastern suburbs to prevent further deterioration and allow for repairs. Police will be enforcing the new 30kph speed limits in the following areas: Avondale, Avonside, Burwood, Clifton/Richmond Hill, Dallington, Ferrymead, Horseshoe Lake, New Brighton, North New Brighton, Parklands, Richmond, St Andrews/Mt Pleasant/Balmoral Hill, Sumner, Waimari Beach/Northshore. The reduced speed limit will remain in place until the roads have been repaired. I am in Wellington today with my colleagues for the CERA legislation.</p>
<p>BRENDON BURNS: More than 100 people turned out to the first public meeting I have called since the February quake. I shared the meeting with my colleague Lianne Dalziel who gave an excellent summary of issues facing her constituents. Two insurance industry representatives, Lianne and I also fielded questions. Further meetings will be held soon. Yesterday at 5pm was the deadline for applications for Red Cross hardship grants. This service has been essential in the weeks following the quake and my sincere thanks go to The Red Cross and their team. I believe the Red Cross is considering the next round of grants and I hope to have more information later in the week. In the interim or for updates call 0800 754 726.Today I am in Wellington with my colleagues for the introduction of the CERA legislation.</p>
