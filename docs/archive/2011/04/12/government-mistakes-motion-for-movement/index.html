<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Government Mistakes Motion for Movement</strong></p>
<p>The ink is barely dry on the last review of the Government’s science sector, but Research Science and Technology Minister Wayne Mapp is already reviewing Crown Research Institutes in a move to influence another merger.</p>
<p>“The last CRI review rejected further mergers. Conducting yet another review on a whim, at taxpayers’ expense, shows the Government has no plan for science and innovation,” says Labour’s spokesperson for Research, Science and Technology David Shearer.</p>
<p>“This is ad hoc thinking. The Minister believes that the more consultants and money he spends on reviews, the more likely he is to lay claim to a ‘good idea’ which will address where science and innovation in New Zealand should be going.</p>
<p>“This Government mistakes motion for movement. Shuffling yet another review through is not the same as real action and progress.</p>
<p>“It simply shows once again that this Government has no plan. It is running the country on reviews and polls.</p>
<p>“What will his next big idea be? Form must follow function. Mapp’s plans have the potential to cause massive disruption to a critical area of New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The 4400 scientists who carry out some of our best research will be concerned that the Minister is tinkering with something without any real understanding of the costs or benefits--- if any--- that might come from it, ” David Shearer said.</p>
