<p><strong>Monday, 4 April 2011, 9:22 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions">New Zealand Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p>Canterbury Workers Need More Support</p>
<p>The CTU is seeking more support for Canterbury workers affected by the February earthquake.</p>
<p>Peter Conway, CTU Secretary said &quot;we have asked the Government to extend the period for the earthquake support subsidy and job loss cover rather than phase these programmes out over coming weeks. We have also requested the development of specific training and employment programmes&quot;.</p>
<p>Marty Braithwaite, CTU Earthquake Response Coordinator, says, &quot;we have heard that of the 55,000 workers supported through the earthquake support subsidy, as many as 20,000 could be unemployed when the Government withdraws the subsidy&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This would be a disaster&quot;, he said. &quot;We will see many leave Canterbury, confidence will evaporate, and there will be considerable hardship for a long period&quot;.</p>
<p>The CTU is now proposing ongoing income protection for displaced Canterbury workers for up to a year until major employment opportunities come on stream. This could be funded if necessary through additional borrowing or a levy for two years of 0.5% on incomes above $50,000 and 1% on income above $100,000 a year.</p>
<p>Peter Conway said that the Government needs to recognise that the Canterbury labour market has specific requirements that do not apply elsewhere and that it is simply wrong to phase out assistance and rely on the unemployment benefit and other existing schemes.</p>
<p>&quot;While some of the 55,000 workers currently being assisted will find jobs, or are able to go back to work in their existing jobs, there is a major risk that within the next six weeks there will be thousands of additional unemployed people in Canterbury with no job prospects, no involvement in training schemes and limited access to main benefits&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government cannot allow this to happen&quot;.</p>
