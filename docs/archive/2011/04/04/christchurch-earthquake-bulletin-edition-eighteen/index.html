<p>LABOUR MPs<br>4 April 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Christchurch Earthquake bulletin edition eighteen</strong></p>
<p>The Labour Party’s Christchurch electorate MPs, <strong>Clayton Cosgrove (Waimakariri), Ruth Dyson (Port Hills), Lianne Dalziel (Christchurch East) and Brendon Burns (Christchurch Central)</strong> have started a regular bulletin to keep people in their electorates and media informed about what is happening at grass roots level.</p>
<p><strong>CLAYTON COSGROVE:</strong> The Government started on the right foot after the quake with its immediate business assistance package, but now businesses are going to the wall, and the Government plans to drop its package in a few weeks. I am worried about how serious the unemployment problem is about to become in Christchurch, and even Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has not been able to negate predictions that many thousands of Christchurch people will soon be on the scrapheap. Very little will change in the next few weeks as the assistance package is watered down and then disappears. The approach of businesses is quite simple --- they want to get out of munted premises, to get new premises, restock them and start trading again. I am seriously concerned about how effectively the Government is actually listening to businesses and the people they employ. Overseas disasters have taught us the lesson that recovery plans have to be from the bottom up. The Government’s so-called 20-member Community Forum won’t be designed to do that. The business assistance programme simply must continue. John Key promised no one would be worse off. This is now the acid test of that. Businesses will represent the heart of our community in the future. Labour MPs still await responses from letters sent to Gerry Brownlee, John Key and the Christchurch City Council. In some cases the letters are almost three weeks old. This week I will be attending another Civil Defence briefing, and also three meetings across my electorate in the sixth round of EQC community briefings since September.</p>

<p><strong>RUTH DYSON:</strong> This morning I have been invited to speak to one of my local schools. The children have designed a project which looks at community involvement in recovery after a crisis. This reflects the wonderful work our schools are doing to integrate the realities children are facing into their learning. Tonight I am attending a concert by the Linwood College Orchestra, the group who are fundraising to perform at Westminister Abbey on Anzac day this year. This concert is to thank all those in the community who have helped them achieve their goal. Another group bound for great things overseas are the Christchurch Special Olympians. A part of the New Zealand Special Olympics team for Athens this group face a unique challenge. Their fundraising efforts are stalled, as expected, following the earthquake. I met with the group and was moved by their humility. They don’t want to ask for money from their struggling community but are facing an uphill battle to achieve their goals. If you want to support the group please contact my office on: Phone: 03 389 2262 or Email: <a href="mailto:porthills.mp@parliament.govt.nz">porthills.mp@parliament.govt.nz</a>. Over the weekend my concerns about the increasing social hardship in the community was heightened. We have seen further job losses and I expect the wave of redundancies to continue as the Government cuts business support. Yesterday I went to a Samoan Church to check in with constituents. On a par with job loss is the downturn in trade. Many taxi drivers and other small businesses reliant on the CBD are in real strife. The downturn in trade is not supported in the Government’s second business support package, and with conferences, events and tourism hindered by the quake morale is low.</p>
<p><strong>LIANNE DALZIEL:</strong> Today I am waiting at my home in Bexley for the EQC team to come and undertake a full assessment. I feel EQC has learnt some lessons in terms of prioritising suburbs since September last year, with those most damaged, many in my electorate of Christchurch East, getting seen to relatively promptly. I understand the feeling of limbo many people are in. A part of the process to claim insurance is itemising all of your irreparable possessions. I have been putting this off. There are many items which have huge sentimental value. One is a beautiful Italian china planter which was given to me by a close friend for my 21st birthday. I have carted it around for over 25 years. But ultimately things can be replaced--- people can’t. There are a number of initiatives worthy of mention, one run by Caroline McGlinchy and Joanne Grove, of Smash Palace in Wellington. These inspired artists took Cantabrians’ treasured heirlooms while here last week and reinvented them as jewellery. The service was free and many lined up for hours. My own neighbours in Bexley are thinking of running similar workshops Wearing a memoir of the destruction may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but an initiative which gets people together in a creative and constructive way should be applauded. I’ve been reading cabinet papers in relation to the newly established Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA). Labour is aware that the devil is in the detail, and I will turn my attention to that this week. So far my reading reinforces how completely wrong the Government got the response in September, almost as if they were completely unaware of international best practice, or what the process of recovery even means. Following February 22 they have moved to a command and control structure--- another extreme which ignores the process of recovery. I gave a speech on Friday to a public forum in Dunedin where I outlined concerns with the Government’s approach. The speech can be found here: <a href="http://www.labour.org.nz/news/shaken-now-stirred">http://www.labour.org.nz/news/shaken-now-stirred</a></p>
<p><strong>BRENDON BURNS:</strong> I met on Friday with several Christchurch firefighters who are angry at having been stood down two weeks ago. They feel they have been sitting at fire stations when they could be in the CBD using their skills to enter damaged buildings and rescue data, files, stock and possession. If the Fire Service could get funding to allow firefighters from around the country to return to Christchurch, we could have 100-plus Christchurch firefighters freed up to go in and help. Surely the needs of businesses, many of whom risk going under, should be the priority here? The F-word (frustration) is also being used by many CBD residents. I took a delegation on Friday to see the Controller. As one put it, “CBD residents seem to be at the bottom of the current pecking order”. The key concerns from Avon Loop representatives were about the placement of cordons; the lack of advice about road works; a lack of police presence outside cordons but still within the CBD; and the need to get engineering clearance for the Hurley St community cottage. A resident representing Cambridge Tce residents wanted to get advice about when the six-storey Rolleston Court would come down and allow him, and about 80 other residents, back into their homes. Two Poplar Lane residents raised issues about access and the problem presented with on-going uncertainty about whether buildings will be demolished – in the interim, insurance companies won’t pay any claims. Controller John Hamilton undertook to look at addressing the concerns. Another major concern is that the city’s sewerage system is on the brink of collapse. Silt has clogged the ponds putting at risk their capacity to absorb and process sewage. The message is where you have portaloos dotting your streets and/or chemloos distributed, try and use these for faeces. And when flushing other waste and grey water, keep an eye out to see it’s not emptying on your neighbours’ properties.</p>
