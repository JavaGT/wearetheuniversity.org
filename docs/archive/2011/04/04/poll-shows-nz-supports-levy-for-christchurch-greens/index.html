<p>Poll shows NZ supports levy for Christchurch</p>
<p>A new poll shows strong support for a temporary levy to pay for Christchurch earthquake recovery, the Green Party announced today.</p>
<p>A nationwide phone survey has revealed resounding support for a levy on income greater than $48,000 and a preference for the temporary levy ahead of deep spending cuts and/or more borrowing.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders clearly want to do the right thing and we know a temporary levy is smart economics, so the Government&#39;s refusal to consider it looks more and more foolish,&quot; said Green Party Co-leader Russel Norman.</p>
<p>&quot;John Key has shown in the past he&#39;s willing to listen New Zealand, hopefully this poll, on top of the advice of several economic commentators, will shift his thinking.&quot;</p>
<p>The poll conducted by UMR Research showed total support for the temporary levy proposal at 57%. New Zealanders also preferred a levy (40%) to big Government cuts (29%) and to more borrowing (22%).</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders have a great deal of compassion for Canterbury. They&#39;ve been incredibly generous in giving to charities and they understand that we have an enormous bill to pay through central Government. They&#39;re prepared to shoulder a temporary tax even at a time when household budgets are tight,&quot; Dr Norman said.</p>
<p>&quot;They also understand the economics and support a fiscally responsible approach. Kiwis get that more debt is very bad for the country and deep spending cuts will be catastrophic.&quot;</p>
<p>The Green Party estimates that a levy of 1.5% applied to income between $48,001 and $70000 and 3.0% on income above $70,000, while leaving the corporate tax rate unchanged at 30%, would raise $1.026 billion per annum. People earning $50,000 a year would pay an additional 58 cents per week. People earning $70,000 per year would pay an additional $6.33 per week. People on $100,000 would pay an additional $23.59 per week</p>

<p>The Government has put the costs of rebuilding in Christchurch at approximately $5 billion, but has ruled out a temporary levy in favour of deep spending cuts and more borrowing.</p>
<p>&quot;Borrowing carries a big risk of a credit rating downgrade, which would add significant deadweight costs right across the economy,&quot; Dr Norman noted.</p>
<p>&quot;The other part of the Government&#39;s approach is to cut public sector spending at a time of weak economic activity, which carries the risk of sending the economy back into recession.</p>
<p>&quot;A temporary levy avoids these risks, as it spreads the cost of rebuilding Christchurch fairly throughout the economy,&quot; said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>Increased Government borrowing would also cost taxpayers over $250 million a year in additional interest costs, according to Green Party estimates.</p>
<p>The new poll, conducted March 24-27, surveyed a nationally representative sample of 750 New Zealanders over the age of 18.</p>
