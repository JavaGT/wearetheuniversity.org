<p><strong>National Standards Push Science Teaching Even Further Into the Background</strong></p>
<p>The education sector union NZEI TE Riu Roa says the government’s narrow focus on National Standards in numeracy and literacy will push the teaching of science even further into the background.</p>
<p>A new report into the state of science education in schools by the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor, Professor Sir Peter Gluckman, emphasises the importance of early science education. It also says research has found that Year 5 students receive, on average just one hour of science education a week.</p>
<p>NZEI says it is important to remember that New Zealand students are ranked fourth in science among OECD countries.</p>
<p>NZEI President Ian Leckie says schools recognise the importance of science learning but historically many have struggled to give it the priority it deserves due to a lack of resources, equipment and specialist teacher knowledge.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately that situation is only going to get worse given the Government’s focus on a narrow set of National Standards,” he says.</p>
<p>In its push to implement National Standards the government has made big cuts to the school advisory service. Many specialist science advisors, who help schools improve the quality of their science content, have been let go. The funding has been redirected towards National Standards to boost the numbers of advisors in literacy and numeracy.</p>
<p>Ian Leckie says it’s very short-sighted.</p>
<p>“If the government suddenly wants to focus on lifting science achievement those advisors are now gone and you can’t just get them back.”</p>

<p>“What schools need to improve the teaching of science is teacher training programmes which better incorporate science, access to specialist advice and resourcing as well as some basic equipment.”</p>
<p>NZEI believes it is worth noting that as the Prime Minister’s own science advisor stresses the importance of science teaching, the government continues to pursue a narrow policy which will only serve to relegate it.</p>
