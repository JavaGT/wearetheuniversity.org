<p><strong>Tuesday, 5 April 2011, 9:10 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>English must resign over SCF mishandling</p>
<p>National’s mishandling of the South Canterbury Finance collapse is a disaster of epic proportions and Finance Minister Bill English must resign, says Labour’s Finance spokesperson David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“Bill English and company turned down recapitalisation offers that would have limited taxpayer costs for SCF to around $500 million,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“Instead National insisted on throwing it into receivership. National has grossly mishandled the issue.</p>
<p>“Losses have already reached $1.2 billion and are still climbing,” David Cunliffe said. “The extra $700 million lost to the taxpayer is in effect roughly equivalent to all the new money John Key has just cut out of this year’s budget.</p>
<p>“It just doesn’t stack up. Reputable bidders like the New Zealand Super Fund, Ngāi Tahu and a major international investment bank were turned away. Assets were left to rot in receivership, and it’s no surprise their value collapsed.</p>
<p>“I said this would happen six months ago, and I’m sorry to say it’s come to pass,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“Bill English must resign immediately, or release all the offer documents and advice he has so far withheld.”</p>
