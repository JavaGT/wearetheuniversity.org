<p>Schools need resources not letters to address bullying</p>
<p>If the government wants to lay down the law to schools on bullying it should be prepared to take action itself and offer some meaningful assistance, says the education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa.</p>
<p>Following a directive from the Prime Minister, schools are starting to receive letters today from the Education Minister reminding them of their responsibilities to provide a safe environment for all students.</p>
<p>NZEI says schools are already committed to preventing bullying and it’s the government which needs to show the same commitment by providing more resources.</p>
<p>“What use is a letter reminding schools of their obligations when they already know what those obligations and responsibilities are?” asks NZEI President Ian Leckie.</p>
<p>“Schools know they have a big role to play and crack down on bullying when they become aware of it. However bullying can be quite sophisticated and insidious and schools often don’t know students are at risk until things are at breaking point.”</p>
<p>Ian Leckie says there is also a sense of frustration that the Ministry of Education can put pressure on schools to enrol at-risk or difficult students without adequate support and resourcing.</p>
<p>Social issues are at the heart of bullying and there are fresh figures showing that the number of children younger than 9 dealt with by the police for assaulting others almost doubled last year from the previous year.</p>
<p>“Extra resources such as extending the social workers in schools programme would be very welcome,” Mr Leckie says.</p>
<p>“We all want our children to be safe but without any commitment to better support and resource schools to deal with it and tackle the wider issues, the Minister’s letter is completely meaningless and will be largely ignored.”</p>
