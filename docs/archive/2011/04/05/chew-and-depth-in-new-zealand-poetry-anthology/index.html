<p>&quot;Chew and depth&quot; in New Zealand Poetry anthology</p>
<p>A brand new issue of the online anthology Best New Zealand Poems has been released by Victoria University&#39;s International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML), containing the best 25 poems from 2010.</p>
<p>The anthology includes work from well-known writers like Fleur Adcock, Elizabeth Smither, Ian Wedde, Jenny Bornholdt, James Brown, Gregory O&#39;Brien and Poet Laureate Cilla McQueen as well as some of the rising stars of New Zealand literature. The anthology can be accessed here: <a href="http://bit.ly/fhX7lO">http://bit.ly/fhX7lO</a>.</p>
<p>This year&#39;s Best New Zealand Poems is edited by IIML Senior Lecturer Chris Price-a former editor of Landfall and herself a well-known poet. She says she is particularly pleased to have included &quot;two comets long lost from the local poetry firmament&quot;-David Mitchell, who has published almost nothing since his near-legendary Pipe Dreams in Ponsonby in 1972, and John Newton, author of the much admired book about Baxter&#39;s Jerusalem, The Double Rainbow.</p>
<p>She notes in her introduction that she was looking for, and found, &quot;poems with enough chew and depth to make them worth repeated tasting&quot;.</p>
<p>Series editor Professor Bill Manhire says that it&#39;s exciting to see such a strong selection at the end of the first decade of the 21st century. &quot;It&#39;s one of New Zealand&#39;s best kept secrets, just how good we are at poetry-Best New Zealand Poems is one way of telling the world what we all know locally&quot;</p>

<p>Professor Manhire and his colleague Damien Wilkins have been making a &quot;best of the best&quot; selection from the first 10 years of Best New Zealand Poems. It will be published by Victoria University Press, and launched in May at the Auckland Writers&#39; Festival.</p>
<p>Professor Manhire says that sound files will soon to be added to back issues of Best New Zealand Poems. &quot;We already have authors&#39; notes and lots of useful links. But everyone tells us that poems make most sense when their authors read them aloud. Now you&#39;ll be able to see the poems on screen and hear the poets read them at the same time.&quot;</p>
