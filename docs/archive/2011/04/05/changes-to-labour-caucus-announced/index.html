<p><strong>Tuesday, 5 April 2011, 11:45 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Changes to Labour caucus announced</p>
<p>Labour Leader Phil Goff has appointed Sue Moroney and David Shearer as the party&#39;s new Education spokespeople.</p>
<p>Sue Moroney will be the spokesperson for the primary and secondary sectors and will continue to hold the Early Childhood Education portfolio. She will move onto what is known as the Front Bench, ranked number 12, in recognition of the importance of the education portfolio.</p>
<p>David Shearer will take responsibility for the tertiary education sector and will continue to hold the Research, Science &amp; Technology portfolio.</p>
<p>&quot;Sue and David will be strong, effective advocates for parents and children throughout the country. They&#39;ll show no fear when it comes to holding this Government to account for its failings in the education sector.&quot;</p>
<p>The Labour caucus also voted to elect Rick Barker as the party&#39;s new Chief Whip. Rick Barker has held numerous key positions in the past, including as a Cabinet Minister, Junior Whip and Senior Government Whip.</p>
<p>Rick Barker currently holds the role of Assistant Speaker. Labour Leader Phil Goff will nominate Manukau East MP Ross Robertson to replace Mr Barker in that role.</p>
<p>Other portfolio changes including Iain Lees-Galloway taking over as Defence spokesperson from David Shearer and Steve Chadwick will add the role of Associate Health (Aged Care) and Senior Citizens to her list of responsibilities.</p>
