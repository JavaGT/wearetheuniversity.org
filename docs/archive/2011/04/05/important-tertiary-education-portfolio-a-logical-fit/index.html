<p>Important tertiary education portfolio a &#39;logical fit&#39;</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s newly-appointed Tertiary Education spokesperson David Shearer says his new responsibilities are a logical fit with his existing portfolio of research, science and technology.</p>
<p>&quot;Tertiary education is a hugely important area to support so that every Kiwi, regardless of who they are and where they come from, can achieve their full potential and contribute to New Zealand&#39;s society and economy,&quot; David Shearer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Increasing our skills base and commercialising more technology and innovation from our tertiary sector are crucial to creating Kiwis jobs and lifting Kiwi incomes.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s no more important time to do that than now when our economy is mired in recession, and our skills base is neglected and in crisis,&quot; David Shearer said.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand&#39;s incomes are falling behind the rest of the world, and so is our investment in science. The Government has no strategy to deal with either problem.&quot;</p>
<p>David Shearer said he was very happy to have been given his new responsibility.</p>
<p>&quot;I relish the opportunity to look at skills training in particular.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the past 18 months I have been talking with and working with universities and other educational institutions and crown research entities, and it&#39;s great to be able to advance that work.&quot;</p>
