<p><strong>VISITING THE UK AND FRANCE</strong></p>
<p>I hope you have a happy and safe Easter and Anzac weekend with your family.</p>
<p>This week I left for <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15314.link">my visit to the United Kingdom and France</a> so I&#39;ll be in London on Anzac Day for commemorations at Hyde Park.</p>
<p>Anzac Day is a day to pay tribute to all our servicemen and women, both living and gone. I&#39;m always impressed by the number of Kiwis who attend dawn services and other Anzac commemorations throughout New Zealand and the world. It&#39;s a great chance for us to come together as New Zealanders and remember our Anzac heroes.</p>
<p>A few of my other activities overseas include meeting Her Majesty the Queen for lunch, and meeting British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.</p>
<p>My wife Bronagh and I will also attend the wedding of His Royal Highness Prince William and Catherine Middleton next week. We&#39;re looking forward to it.</p>
<p>This week I announced New Zealand&#39;s wedding gift to the couple. <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15315.link">We&#39;re donating $10,000 to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal, which is one of their nominated charities</a>.</p>
<p><strong>REMEMBERING WEST COAST MINERS</strong></p>
<p>The Government is <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15316.link">contributing $3.5 million to The West Coast Miners Memorial Events Centre in Greymouth</a>.</p>

<p>This centre will be a memorial for all those who have lost their lives in West Coast mining disasters, including the 29 men who died in the Pike River tragedy last year.</p>
<p>The project was proposed by the West Coast community, and the Government is pleased to contribute to this enduring memorial to West Coast miners.</p>
<p><strong>STANDING ALONGSIDE CANTABRIANS</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;d like to thank everyone who is working hard to help Canterbury get back on its feet. In my visits to the region, I&#39;ve been encouraged by how well people down there are coping despite the continuing aftershocks.</p>
<p>This week <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15317.link">I announced extra funding for Christchurch and Canterbury Tourism</a> because the tourism sector has been severely affected by the earthquake.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Development, Christchurch City Council, and Christchurch International Airport will together support Christchurch and Canterbury Tourism with an extra $1.6 million.</p>
<p>Christchurch is the gateway for South Island tourism. This boost to funding will help rebuild existing tourism and travel activity.</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking forward to visiting Christchurch again shortly after I return from overseas. The Government is 100 per cent committed to supporting Cantabrians in the weeks, months, and years ahead. For further information on the Government&#39;s response, see <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15318.link">www.cera.govt.nz</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has made a donation to the official Government earthquake appeal at <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15319.link">www.quakeappeal.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>PUTTING VICTIMS FIRST</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday Justice Minister Simon Power announced <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15320.link">further measures to enhance the rights and services provided to victims of crime</a>. The measures include: allowing victims to say more in their victim impact statements, improving the victim notification system, developing a Victims Code, and setting up a Victims Centre within the Ministry of Justice.</p>
<p>I want to eliminate the horror stories where victims are forced to relive a traumatic event simply because the system has been deficient or has let them down, and where it seems offenders are getting a better deal than victims. Where there is a balancing of rights to be done between criminals and victims, I will take a side. I will take the side of the victims.</p>
<p>This package of proposals builds on eight initiatives we put in place for victims last year, which are <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15321.link">funded through the $50 Offender Levy</a>, and the introduction of <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15322.link">on-the-spot police safety orders</a>.</p>
<p><strong>DELIVERING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE</strong></p>
<p>Last week Social Development Minister Paula Bennett announced that <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15323.link">10,000 young people have taken part in the Job Ops programme so far</a>, including more than 3500 young Maori and Pacific people.</p>
<p>National&#39;s Jobs Ops programme provides employers with a $5000 subsidy to create a position for an unskilled 16- to 24-year-old. I first announced the programme in 2009 and we expanded it last year, so that more young people could take part and get work experience.</p>
<p>Of the more than 4500 young people who have completed their Job Ops programme, more than 70 per cent got a job, and 90 per cent aren&#39;t on a benefit.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p><strong>John Key<br>Prime Minister</strong></p>
