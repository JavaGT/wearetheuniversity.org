<p><strong>University of Canterbury researchers reveal amazing navigational precision of humpback whales</strong></p>
<p>Researchers based at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand have found that migrating humpback whales achieve navigational precision usually associated with jetliners or arrows.</p>
<p>The findings, published this week in the Royal Society journal <em>Biology Letters</em>, confirm that humpback whales (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>) can perform straight line movements over thousands of kilometers of open-ocean during the longest documented mammalian migrations.</p>
<p>The research team, led by Dr Travis Horton and Dr Richard Holdaway of the University of Canterbury, showed that humpbacks perform these straight line movements without deviating more than a degree, despite the presence of strong sea-surface currents.</p>
<p>“One whale, moving southeast from Brazil towards the South Sandwich Islands, swam over 2200 km during a 28-day period along a heading that varied by less than half a degree,” said Dr Horton.</p>
<p>The data come from sixteen whales that were fitted with 30cm-long, satellite-monitored tags during their seasonal migrations away from low latitude calving grounds off Brazil, New Caledonia, and Rarotonga. The tags are attached to the blubber and fall off over time.</p>
<p>Although the research provides unprecedented insights into the spatial precision of whale migrations, it remains a mystery how such movements are achieved.</p>
<p>“This research findings are a significant result from an extraordinary team effort intended firstly, to describe the navigational capacities of humpback whales, and secondly, to interpret how these navigational behaviours are performed.</p>
<p>“The study advances our understanding of navigational behavior during migration, yet it also raises several questions regarding the external orientation cues used by humpback whales and perhaps other long-distance migrants.”<br>ends</p>
