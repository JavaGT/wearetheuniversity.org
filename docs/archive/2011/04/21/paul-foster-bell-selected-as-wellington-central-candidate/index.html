<p>National Selects Paul Foster-Bell as Wellington Central Candidate</p>
<p>National Party Wellington Central Electorate Chair Dr Pat McCarthy is pleased to announce Paul Foster-Bell will be the Party&#39;s Wellington Central candidate for the General Election on November 26.</p>
<p>&quot;We had very high quality candidates putting their names forward. The level of interest underscores the enthusiasm in the Party as we move into the election year contest. I want to thank everyone who has taken part in the process.&quot;</p>
<p>Newly selected Wellington Central candidate Paul Foster-Bell says he is humbled by the selection and looks forward to the opportunity of fighting for the privilege of representing the people of Wellington in John Key&#39;s Government.</p>
<p>&quot;For our community this election is about giving Wellington Central a strong voice in Government. The sense I get from our community is that it welcomes the comprehensive plan to grow the economy, to start living within our means, deliver enduring jobs, and build the critical infrastructure to future proof New Zealand and our region. I&#39;m also a strong supporter of the Government&#39;s continued focus on law and order - so we can feel safe in our communities and our homes.</p>
<p>&quot;I enter this election contest taking nothing for granted and knowing that I have to earn the respect and trust of an electorate that deserves a strong voice within the National caucus.&quot;</p>
<p>Foster-Bell, 34, grew up in Northland and has a Degree in Archaeology and a Diploma in Business from Otago University. He has called Wellington home for the past eight years.</p>

<p>Foster-Bell&#39;s candidacy follows a seven year career in New Zealand&#39;s diplomatic service - the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT). He returned last year from an overseas posting to Tehran as Deputy Head of Mission, and is currently a Deputy Director at MFAT, and will be taking extended leave from the public service to campaign.</p>
<p>Foster-Bell intends to use his background in the civil service and experience in promoting New Zealand companies and products overseas to work alongside exporters to contribute to the Government&#39;s ongoing removal of the roadblocks to growth and to support innovation.</p>
<p>Of English, Scots and Maori descent, Foster-Bell is interested in heritage preservation and environmental issues. Aside from politics, his other hobbies include genealogy, social media, cooking and enjoying Wellington&#39;s magnificent harbour.</p>
