<p>David<br>SHEARER<br>Tertiary Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>17 April 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Older workers deserve ability to up-skill</strong></p>
<p>Older workers should be encouraged to up-skill or retrain rather than being shut out of educational opportunities that could improve their work situation, says Labour’s Tertiary Education Spokesperson David Shearer.</p>
<p>“Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce has been systematically making it more difficult for older New Zealanders to access education.</p>
<p>“The Adult Education sector has been decimated. Only a fraction of schools now offer night classes compared to a year ago. Extramural student numbers have fallen as a result of caps on university spending.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce is now indicating he will limit access to student loans for living costs for older New Zealanders. We have an ageing workforce in a rapidly changing work environment. People need to have the opportunity to adapt and change to meet new employment demands, not have the door slammed in their face.</p>
<p>“Our economy must be based on a highly skilled workforce. Older workers deserve the same chances as our young graduates. Often they are people who have paid their taxes all their lives and therefore deserve the opportunity to take some time out to up-skill or retrain,” said David Shearer.</p>
