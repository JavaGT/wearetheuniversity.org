<p><strong>Government slams door on seniors</strong></p>
<p>The Government’s announcement that it will limit access to the student loan living allowance for older New Zealanders is yet another short-sighted example of National’s approach to education, says Labour’s spokesperson for Senior Citizens Steve Chadwick.</p>
<p>“This is another savage blow for seniors when cuts to adult education have already limited their access to learning opportunities.</p>
<p>“The message from this Government seems to be that senior education has no valuable contribution to make to New Zealand.</p>
<p>“In fact the opposite is true. Many of our seniors want to advance their learning so that they can participate in the voluntary sector and act as a coach and tutor to many who can benefit from their skills, wisdom and experience. They find on the job learning doesn’t cut it, and use short courses to update their skills.</p>
<p>“This announcement is short-sighted, punitive and harsh. Most New Zealanders realise that the learning pathway never stops,” Steve Chadwick said.</p>
<p>“Older workers should be encouraged to up-skill or retrain rather than being shut out of educational opportunities that could improve their situation.</p>
<p>“Adult education and study offers opportunities seniors perhaps couldn’t take up earlier in their lives. It keeps older New Zealanders active, and connected to their families and networks,” Steve Chadwick said.</p>
<p>Steve Chadwick said Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce has been systematically making it more difficult for older New Zealanders to access education.</p>
<p>“We have an ageing workforce. People should not have the door slammed in their face.”  </p>
