<p>Key must sort out &#39;flagship&#39; shambles now</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Key must sort out the shambles of his flagship national standards education policy following a survey that shows less than half of our primary schools are willing to go along with his plans, says Labour&#39;s Education spokesperson Sue Moroney.</p>
<p>Sue Moroney says 1000 schools have responded to a survey sent out by the Principals Federation on behalf of the Boards Taking Action Coalition.</p>
<p>&quot;Just 44 per cent of the schools said they will comply with the legal requirement to set achievement targets against John Key&#39;s national standards. Thirty per cent won&#39;t use the national standards to set targets, and another 26 per cent say they will only do the minimum to comply with the standards.<br>&quot;John Key&#39;s insistence on forcing the discredited national standards approach on primary schools is distracting schools from delivering quality education, and children&#39;s education will suffer as a result,&quot; Sue Moroney said.</p>
<p>&quot;He should have intervened well before it got to the stage recently where 750 school principals took a vote of &#39;no confidence&#39; in the standards and Education Minister Anne Tolley. He certainly has no excuse for not acting now as a result of this survey.</p>
<p>&quot;Schools tell me they are complying with the Government&#39;s instructions because they feel they have to, but would rather be spending time and money on lifting student achievements,&quot; Sue Moroney said.</p>
<p>&quot;National is risking our children&#39;s education by insisting on implementing a system that most schools don&#39;t agree with.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s no way a system promoting so much non-compliance could even remotely be labelled as a &#39;national&#39; system&#39;,&quot; Sue Moroney said.</p>
<p>&quot;If it wasn&#39;t so tragic from the point of view of our children, it would be a sick joke. A report card assessing the Government&#39;s implementation of national standards would have to say &#39;did not achieve&#39;.&quot;</p>
