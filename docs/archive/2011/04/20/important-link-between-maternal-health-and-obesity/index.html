<h3>Important link between maternal health and obesity</h3>
<p>The proven link between maternal health and obesity in children will be an important tool in the effort to improve maternal and infant health, says Labour’s spokesperson for Maternal Health Steve Chadwick.</p>
<p>“This is great news. Clinicians have always known about the link between diet in early pregnancy and brain development in the new-born and a child&#39;s infancy, but now we are far better informed of the importance of diet and the link to obesity,” Steve Chadwick said.</p>
<p>“The new study gives greater weight to the call for better services to support maternal and infant health at the early stages of a child’s development.</p>
<p>The study, led by researchers at the University of Southampton, with assistance of teams from New Zealand and Singapore, links a mother’s diet with the function of her child’s DNA meaning that before birth a mother’s diet can predicate the child’s degree of obesity at six or nine years old</p>
<p>“The findings reinforce the importance of health service funding supporting young parents in pregnancy, free ante natal classes and the need for a plan for youth pregnancy and parenting.</p>
<p>“When in government Labour approved such a plan, but no focused progress has been made under National.</p>
<p>“Public health is about investing in health promotion and disease prevention, but National’s not interested in that.</p>
<p>“Families are struggling with the ever-increasing cost of living and mothers are often forced to skip a balanced nutritional diet which is needed for a baby’s development.</p>
<p>“Labour’s policy to remove GST on fresh fruit and vegetables is one measure which will help parents to eat more affordably,” Steve Chadwick said.</p>
