<p><strong>Wednesday, 20 April 2011, 9:09 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National Selects Scott Simpson as Coromandel Candidate</p>
<p>National Party Coromandel Electorate Chair Ian McClean is pleased to announce that Scott Simpson will be the Party&#39;s Coromandel candidate for the General Election on 26 November.</p>
<p>&quot;We had very high quality candidates putting their names forward and I am delighted that Scott will be our candidate. The calibre of candidates underscores the enthusiasm in the Party as we move into the election year contest. I want to thank everyone who has taken part in the process.&quot;</p>
<p>Newly selected Coromandel candidate Scott Simpson says he is both humbled and excited by his selection and is looking forward to the opportunity of fighting for the privilege of representing the people of Coromandel in John Key&#39;s Government.</p>
<p>&quot;For the many communities that make up the Coromandel electorate this election is about picking up where Sandra Goudie has left off and continuing to ensure Coromandel has a strong voice in Government&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The sense I get is that Coromandel people welcome the Government&#39;s comprehensive plan to grow our economy, to start living within our means, delivering enduring jobs and building the critical infrastructure to future-proof New Zealand and our region.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m also a strong supporter of the Government&#39;s continued focus on law and order so we can all feel safe in our communities and our homes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I enter this election contest taking nothing for granted and knowing I will have to earn the respect and trust of an electorate that is used to having a strong voice in the national caucus.&quot;</p>
<p>Scott is a fourth generation &#39;Coromandelite&#39;. His great grandparents settled in Kuaotunu just north of Whitianga in 1890, with subsequent generations still farming at Wharekaho (Simpson&#39;s Beach) today.</p>
<p>Scott has two adult children, is a graduate of Auckland University, a Justice of the Peace and currently CEO of the nationwide children&#39;s charity, Make-A-Wish NZ. He has previously held General Manager roles with Protector Safety, HPM NZ and Caroma Industries.</p>
<p>Scott currently divides his time between his property at Kuaotunu and Auckland but will be permanently based in Thames as a result of his selection for Coromandel.</p>
