<p><strong>Green Party Te Tai Hauauru Candidate Selected</strong></p>
<p>Jack Tautokai McDonald (Taranaki Iwi, Te Whakathea, Te Ati Awa) was last night selected as the Green Party Candidate for the Te Tai Hauauru electorate in the 2011 general election. Having just turned 18, Jack will almost certainly be the youngest candidate at the election.</p>
<p>“I am excited to stand for the Greens on the issues that affect Maori – poverty, kaitiakitanga and the just promotion of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.” Mr McDonald said.</p>
<p>Green Party co-leader Metiria Turei said that &quot;Jack will be an excellent Green Party candidate in the Te Tai Hauauru electorate. He is a young, passionate and articulate advocate for the protection of Te Reo Maori and the important role of young people in politics. He works hard for his local community and understands the critical social and environmental issues important to them. It is an honour to have him running as a Green Party candidate at this election.&quot;</p>
<p>He has worked for young people in his roles as a Youth MP and as student representative on the Kapiti College Board of Trustees, and is campaigning with the Alliance for a Sustainable Kapiti to protect his local area from the impacts of National&#39;s roading scheme.</p>
<p>“The campaign against the Kpiti Expressway has taught me how to stand up and fight for my rohe, my community and the environment. It also showed me the disrespect this Government has for Maoritanga: they proposed building the motorway through the waahi tapu of the Takamore people.”</p>

<p>This will be the first election the Greens have campaigned in Te Tai Hauauru, the seat currently held by Maori Party co-leader Tariana Turia.</p>
<p>Mr McDonald said that the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act has entrenched confiscation of ancestral Maori land. He also said that proposed cutbacks in social services would impact on tangata whenua the hardest.</p>
<p>&quot;The Green Party is fighting the ongoing attacks on our whnau by this National/Maori Party Government. I ask all Maori to support us with their party vote.</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to the day when we show kaitiakitanga to our people and to Papatuanuku – when Aoteaora is just, fair, and equal.”</p>
<p>ENDS  </p>
