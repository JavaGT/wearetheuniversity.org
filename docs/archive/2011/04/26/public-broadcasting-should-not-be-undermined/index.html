<p>Clare<br>CURRAN</p>
<p>Broadcasting Spokesperson</p>
<p>26 April 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT<br>Public broadcasting should not be undermined by commercial interests</p>
<p>Radio New Zealand Chair Richard Griffin is considering moves that would begin the process of commercialisation of our state broadcaster, says Labour’s Broadcasting spokesperson Clare Curran.</p>
<p>“Richard Griffin, a former press secretary to Jim Bolger, interviewed on Mediawatch at the weekend, revealed he is open to sponsorship of radio programmes at the state broadcaster even if a law change is needed,” Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>“Griffin denied his appointment was political, but his agenda fits the Government’s view to strip our state broadcasters of public broadcasting functions and turn them towards cost recovery and even profit.</p>
<p>“Commercial sponsorship of RNZ programmes would be the first step towards full commercialisation. Radio New Zealand is the last bastion of public service broadcasting, free from corporate interests and should remain that way,” Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>“The National Government has already shown that it is more interested in supporting commercial organisations than public broadcasters with its bailout of Mediaworks with a $43 million low interest deferred payment for its radio spectrum licence.</p>
<p>“Radio New Zealand plays an important role in New Zealand in providing an alternative voice to the commercial broadcasters out there.</p>
<p>“Labour has called on the nation’s top thinkers, business leaders, politicians, academics and senior media industry figures to converge to discuss the future of public broadcasting and media in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Public service television and radio is essential to an informed society. New Zealanders need an informed and impartial voice,” Clare Curran said.</p>
