<p><strong>Thursday, 28 April 2011, 12:32 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Key/Brash extreme team will hurt mainstream New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>A new extreme right-wing deal between National and an Act party led by Don Brash would have a devastating impact on the lives of middle and low-income New Zealanders, says Labour Leader Phil Goff.</p>
<p>“John Key has described Don Brash as an extremist. But he has also made it very clear that he is prepared to work with his former boss in a future Government. That would be a disaster for our country.</p>
<p>“We know what Don Brash stands for. He wants to slash the minimum wage by $100 a week – putting more New Zealanders into poverty. Superannuation would also be on his hit list.</p>
<p>“Don Brash wants savage cuts to Government spending, including health and education. Working for Families and interest-free student loans would be gone and there would be a wholesale sell-off of our valuable community-owned state assets.</p>
<p>“This is what Kiwis could expect under a Government led by John Key and Don Brash.</p>
<p>“We know how close Don Brash and John Banks are to National. Don Brash is National’s former leader and they are both National Party members. The links are already there and there are grounds for suspicion that today’s outcome is the result of collaboration between the two parties.</p>
<p>“A relationship involving Don Brash and John Banks, at the head of the Act Party, will allow National to pursue all the policies it has wanted to pursue but has been afraid to admit to so far.</p>
<p>“These are not the kinds of policies mainstream New Zealanders support. These are the kinds of policies that will hurt middle and low-income New Zealanders at a time when they are feeling the financial squeeze as a result of rising prices and National’s shambolic handling of our economy.</p>
<p>“Labour will fight tooth and nail against the agenda of Don Brash and John Key. Our policies are designed to grow our economy, create jobs and higher incomes, put our children first and stop asset sales. The policies of a Government led by John Key and Don Brash will do the opposite and devastate our country.”</p>
