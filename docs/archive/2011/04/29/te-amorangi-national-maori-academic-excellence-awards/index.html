<p><strong>Te Amorangi National Maori Academic Excellence Awards</strong><br><strong>Turangawaewae Marae, Ngaruawahia</strong><br><strong>Friday 29 April 2011; 9.30pm</strong></p>
<p>Maori Party Co-leaders Tariana Turia and Dr Pita Sharples have tonight extended congratulations from the Maori Party to the Ohia whanau for an incredible affirmation of their whanau at the Te Amorangi National Maori Academic Excellence Awards.</p>
<p>“It is wonderful that the Te Amorangi Awards have recognised the leadership and the legacy left us by the late Dr Monte Rereamoamo Ohia” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“Monte lived his life in a way which continues to inspire me. He was a transformative radical who worked for change and achieved so much”.</p>
<p>‘Sadly, the concept of ‘radical’ has taken on a pejorative edge when it is associated with destructive or aggressive behaviours – leaving followers to focus more on the messenger than the message”</p>
<p>“Monte actively challenged that definition – he was driven by a belief in what was possible and he and his whanau set about a path of transformation that was about Maori advancement, about whanau ora, about kaupapa Maori, about wellbeing”</p>
<p>“He possessed extraordinary wisdom, and I continue to feel uplifted by the guidance and knowledge he shared with us.</p>
<p>“His doctorate thesis – <em>Towards a value-based transformation movement for Maori advancement</em> – reflects the inspiration and the impetus of his leadership. We miss him greatly but his spirit will remain with us forever”</p>
<p>Dr Sharples also took up the opportunity to congratulate Bentham Ohia on receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award – Te Tohu Whakamahara ki Te Arikinui Te Atairangikaahu.</p>

<p>“Bentham is a passionate and committed educational leader, very much like his Dad. As Te Pouhere for Te Wananga o Aotearoa, our largest tertiary provider, he has been instrumental in spreading the powerful influence of learning throughout every community”</p>
<p>“Bentham has not only continued to uphold the excellent reputation of Te Wananga o Aotearoa through his skilled management- he has also facilitated some exciting international relationships with indigenous nations”.</p>
<p>“Our hearts are with the Ohia whanau - and indeed all the doctoral graduates honoured tonight - as they celebrate these very considerable achievements”.</p>

<p><em>The Te Amorangi National Māori Academic Awards is an annual event that acknowledges Māori PhD graduates across the country. Since its inception in 2002 the number of recipients total 239 to date. The awards were instituted in the time when Emeritus Professor Tamati Reedy was instated as Pro Vice Chancellor Māori at Waikato University.</em></p>
<p>_The idea arose from a discussion amongst Māori academics for the need to recognise and celebrate those of Māori descent who had achieved the pinnacle of academic success. For many years Māori have promoted and marked the successes of sporting athletes and entertainers and there was a definite gap in the academic arena, hence the establishment of Te Amorangi National Māori Academic Awards in 2002.  </p>
<p><em>A lifetime achievement award is also presented every year to acknowledge people who have made a significant contribution within the Waikato region. This year the award was given to Bentham Ohia.</em><br>_</p>
