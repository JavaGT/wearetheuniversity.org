<p><strong>What is the Minister Trying to Hide?</strong></p>
<p>The Minister of Education Anne Tolley must release the correspondence requested under the Official Information Act on National Standards, says NZEI Te Riu Roa.</p>
<p>Newstalk ZB requested copies of correspondence from teachers, boards of trustees, principals, the public and parent teacher associations relating to National Standards.</p>
<p>But the minister’s office asked for over $10,000 to pay the cost of collating the documents. After complaining to the Ombudsman, the charge for 430 documents was reduced to $5000.</p>
<p>“There is a double standard at work here,” says NZEI president Ian Leckie. “The government was able to provide all media with thousands of pages of information on ministerial credit cards – free of charge, but it can’t quite bring itself to supply one copy of 430 documents?”</p>
<p>“You have to ask yourself whether this has something to do with the content of the documents. The Minister has claimed all along, despite a noticeable lack of evidence, that she has public support for the National Standards policy.</p>
<p>“Given NZEI’s polling on the issue, and various media polls on National Standards, it would be rather surprising if the documents did show the minister had support. Our polling shows that the support people showed for the policy when it was first announced has eroded.</p>
<p>“Untested and untrialled standards threaten to undermine New Zealand’s high performing education system, and no amount of spin is going to change people’s opinion on the reality of what is happening in schools.”</p>

<p>Mr Leckie noted that the minister had resorted to saying people could vote on the issue at the general elections in November.</p>
<p>“This is further evidence that the minister is trying to avoid the very real issue of a failed policy – despite the impact that this policy is having on children’s learning today.</p>
<p>“It is a rather sad reflection on this government’s attitude to public education and public information.”</p>
