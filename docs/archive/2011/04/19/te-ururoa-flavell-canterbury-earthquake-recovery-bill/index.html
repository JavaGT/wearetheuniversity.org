<p><strong>Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Bill</strong></p>
<p>Second Reading; Te Ururoa Flavell, MP for Waiariki</p>
<p>Tēnā koe, Mr Assistant Speaker; kia ora tātou katoa. Mōrena ki a tātou katoa i tēnei ata i a tātou e wānanga nei i te āhuatanga o tēnei o ngā pire hōu e pā ana ki Ōtautahi. Ko te wāhi ki a au hei whaiwhai haere, ko te āhuatanga o te kōrero o te Hōnore Gerry Brownlee i a ia e kōrero ana mō te taha ki a au ki te Ao Māori. Ka mihi ki a ia mō tāna whakanui i te wāhi ki a Ngāi Tahu, Kai Tahu rānei, i a rātou e whakakorikori nei i a rātou anō, e toro atu te ringa ki uta ki tai, ki wīwī, ki wāwā, ki te iwi Pākehā, ki te iwi Māori rānei nā runga i te hiahia ki te āwhina, tētahi ki tētahi, ko te tautoko a tētahi ki tētahi. E tika ana ki a Kai Tahu, ko rātou tērā i whakapau kaha ki te āwhina i te hunga e rongo nei i te ngau o te mamae, otirā, ko rātou i rongo rānei i te ngau o mate. Ko rātou te hunga i toro atu te ringa ki ngā iwi katoa o te motu. Tērā pea nā ngā iwi i toro atu te ringa ki a Kai Tahu ki te kī ko ngā mamae e pā ana ki a koe Ngāi Tahu, he mamae anō rā ka pā mai ki a au ki a Te Arawa, ki a au ki a Tainui, ki a au ki Te Tai Tokerau. Nō reira, ka pai tērā āhuatanga o te Ao Māori i roto i ngā whiriwhiringa.</p>
<p>E ai ki ngā kōrero, ehara i te mea e tika ana māku a Ngāi Tahu e kōrero ēngari, ko tāku e mōhio nei ko Ngāi Tahu te hunga kāinga, te hunga ahi kā, arā noa atu ētahi ēngari, me pērā rawa te kōrero. Ko te hunga e noho mai rarā i Otautahi, he hītori anō rā tō rātou mō te āhuatanga o te noho ki reira. Arā nō te kōrero “Kā Pākihi whakatekateka o Waitaha”, arā nō te kōrero “Te Pātaka o Rākaihautū”, ēnei āhuatanga katoa he ingoa e mōhiotia ana i roto o tērā takiwā. E ai ki taku mōhio kua roa tētahi iwi e noho mai ana ki reira. E ai ki ngā kōrero o te Ao Māori, e 700 tau te roa o tā rātou noho ki reira. Ā, ka eke atu a Kāti Māmoe, ka eke atu ki reira anō hoki, nō reira, kua noho tahi rātou ki reira mō ngā tau e hia kē nei. E ai ki ngā kōrero, kua puta mai ngā ingoa pēnei i a “Turakautahi”<em>.</em> He rangatira o roto o Ngāi Tūahuriri. Ko ia tērā i noho nei i te Pā o Kaiapoi tērā takiwā. I roto i ngā kōrero kua tae mai ki a au mō Ngāti Huikai, tō rātou rangatira, toa nei a Tautahi_,_ whakatū i tana kāinga, i tana pā tūwatawata, ki tērā takiwā o Ōtautahi. Tae atu ki te wā i puta te kōrero, ko Ōtautahi, hei whaiwhai haere i tērā o ngā rangatira o Ngāti Huikai.</p>

<p>Nō reira, ko te tikanga o taku kōrero he kī atu, āe, he wāhi anō tō te Ao Māori kei tērā takiwā. Kai wareware i a tātou tērā wāhi. Mai rā anō i tā rātou noho ki reira tae rā nō ki ngā rā tata kua hipa ake Ka hoki rā anō ki te āhuatanga o te pakanga nui nei o te ao, te pakanga ki tāwāhi. Ko te Ao Māori anō rā tērā i haere ki tāwāhi ka hoki mai. I āwhina anō rā ki te whāngai, ki te tuku i ngā painga ki ngā hōia i haere ki te tāwāhi ki ngā pakanga nui o te ao. I reira anō hoki te Ao Māori.</p>
<p>Nō nā tata nei e kī ana te kōrero, ka mate te kāinga tahi, ka ora te kāinga rua. He kupu kōrero tērā, he whakataukī e kōrero ana mō te āhuatanga o Ōtautahi tonu. Ka hinga tētahi kāinga, ā, kua hūnuku atu ki te kāinga rua. Nō reira, ēnei kōrero katoa ka hoki mai anō rā ki a au i a tātou e kōrero nei mō tētahi o ngā kaupapa i te ata nei. Nō nā tata nei, anō hoki kua kōrero mātou o te Pāti Māori mō te kaha tautoko o ngā iwi katoa tae atu ki ngā wātene Māori tonu kua tae atu ki Ōtautahi mai i ngā tōpito katoa ki te tautoko i a Kai Tahu, ō ētahi rohe kē i Tākitimu, i a au i a Te Arawa, i Te Tai Tokerau kua hūnuku atu ki reira mō te wā poto. Kua hūnuku ngā ringa raupā o ngā tari hauora ki Ōtautahi tonu ki te āwhina i a rātou. Nō reira, ahakoa kāre au i tae atu ki ngā kōrero i nanahi nei i Ōtautahi, ki te select committee_,_ kāre au i rongo i ngā kōrero. Kua rongo au i ngā kōrero o tēnā, o tēnā, o tēnā i te ata nei ki te kī, āe, i tae atu te hapori ki te whakatakoto i ō rātou nawe. I tōna mutunga mai, kei muri mātou i te Kāwanatanga Nāhinara i roto i ngā whiriwhiringa i te mea, kei te mōhio tonu, arā nō te iwi o Ngāi Tahu e noho nei i roto i te uauatanga. Me pērā rawa te kōrero.</p>
<p>Nō reira, ko tā mātou ko te kī atu, kāti, kua roa a Ngāi Tahu me ētahi atu e noho ana ki reira. E reka ana ki a mātou te āhuatanga o te kōrero a te Minita a Gerry Brownlie, ka whai wāhi a Ngāi Tahu ki roto i ngā kōrero ka puta ā ngā rā kai mua i te aroaro me ētahi Māori anō rā. Ko Te Rūnanga tonu, ko te tikanga ka noho nei i runga i tēnei o ngā rōpū ka whakahaere take nei hei whakaora anō rā i a Ōtautahi, ka mutu, ki taku mōhio ka eke anō rā a Rahui Katene, to mātou mema Pāremata mō tērā rohe ki roto i te kāhui o ngā pāti o te Whare Pāremata ki reira. He mea pai tērā.</p>
<p>Nō reirā, he paku kōrero ki te kī atu, kai wareware ko te reo o te Ao Māori ki reira i roto i tērā tāone o Ōtautahi me te kī atu, kai muri, kai mua, kai ngā taha a Ngāi Tahi i ngā whiriwhiringa katoa mō te aha? Na runga i te whakaaro i tipu mai ai tō rātou whakapapa i reira. Ko te ahi kā, ko rātou tērā nā te āhuatanga o tā rātou here ki te whenua kai reira. Nō reira, me whai wāhi rātou ki roto i ngā nekeneke o te wā. Kei te tautoko ake i te hiahia o te Minita kia wāhi rātou i roto i ngā nekeneke o tēnei pire, me te tūmanako ia, tērā pea ka āta wetewete i te hōhonutanga o te pire ā kō ake nei i te wāhanga komiti. Nō reira, kia ora tātou.</p>
<p>_Greetings to you, Mr Assistant Speaker, and to us all. Good morning to all, as we debate aspects of this new bill relating to Christchurch, at this hour. The part of the Hon Gerry Brownlee’s speech that I want to follow is where I and Māoridom fit into the scheme of things. I commend him for acknowledging the part that Ngāi Tahu or Kai Tahu has played, as they roused themselves by extending a hand in all directions to non-Māori and Māori people in their desire to help and to support one another. For Kai Tahu, it was the right thing to do. So there they were, hard at work giving assistance to those suffering from injuries, and in the case of loss of life. They were the ones who extended a hand to all the people of the nation. Tribes, on the other hand, extended a hand to Kai Tahu, saying: “_Pain suffered by you, Kai Tahu, affects me: Te Arawa, Tainui, and Te Tai Tokerau, as well.” <em>So that aspect of Maoridom is wonderful, in the deliberations.</em></p>
<p><em>Customary lore states that it is not for me to speak for Ngāi Tahu, but I know for a fact that they are the ahi kā, the burning fires of occupation. There is much other anecdotal lore that suggests this, as well. The ones living in Christchurch can historically vouch for their presence there. Take the reference to “The wetlands and plains of Canterbury: Kā Pākihi Whakatekateka o Waitaha”. Here is another one: “Banks Peninsula: Te Pātaka o Rākaihautū”. All these kinds of references are widely known geographical terms in that district. To my understanding, a tribe has lived there for a long period of time. According to stories of the Māori World, that tribe has been there for 700 years. Kāti Māmoe migrated and settled there for a very long time, as well. According to stories, the place name “Turakautahi” came from a Ngāi Tūāhuriri chief. He established Kaiapoi Pā in that area. In the stories that came to me about Ngāti Huakai, their chief—a warrior, Tautahi—set up a settlement in that part of Christchurch, and Ōtautahi became the Māori name for Christchurch, to acknowledge him.</em></p>
<p><em>So the nub of my address is that, yes, Māoridom has a historical connection to that place. We must never lose sight of the fact that Kai Tahu has been there a long time and continues to be there, right up to the present. The circumstances of this presence go back to the great wars of the world, the overseas battles that Māoridom took a part in and returned from. They also helped by providing sustenance to the troops, and supported the war effort in the battles of the world. Māoridom was there, as well.</em></p>
<p><em>The proverb about a first home being no more, and a second one rising up in its place, continues to apply to Christchurch. When a house collapses, the family shifts to a second one. So all these matters came back to mind this morning when we talked about one of the proposals. It was just recently that we of the Māori Party talked about the strong support provided by all tribes, even the Māori wardens, who arrived in Christchurch from everywhere to support Kai Tahu; those of Kai Tahu who shifted for a short time to areas in Tākitimu, and with me in Te Arawa and Te Tai Tokerau. Some health department staff have shifted to Christchurch to specifically help them there. I did not get to Christchurch to hear the submissions to the select committee yesterday, and I still have not heard a thing. I heard different members say this morning that, yes, the community was there to express their concerns. At the end of it all, we support the National-led Government in its deliberations, because we know that the Ngāi Tahu people are living in difficult times, if I may say so.</em></p>
<p><em>So the statement being made here is that Ngāi Tahu and others have been there for a very long time. We are pleased to hear that according to Minister Gerry Brownlee, Ngāi Tahu and other Māori are to be included in the community forum that is to be announced shortly. The Rūnanga of Ngāi Tahu is explicitly one of the entities the new authority must work alongside, in terms of the recovery of Christchurch. Further to that, Rahui Katene, our member of Parliament for the Te Tai Tonga electorate, will be included in the cross-party forum of Canterbury MPs. That has got to be a good thing. And just a little reminder, too, that she is the spokesperson for Māoridom, there in the city of Christchurch.</em></p>
<p><em>Ngāi Tahu is everywhere in the consultation process—front, back, and sides—and for what reason? Their genealogy evolved from there. “Burning fires of occupation”—they are indeed that, and that is the real reason that ties them to the land there. They must be involved in the consultations of the moment. The desire of the Minister to have them involved in every aspect of this bill is endorsed with the hope, as well, that some of the deeper implications of this bill will be carefully unravelled when we get to the Committee stage in due course. So I acknowledge us</em>.</p>
