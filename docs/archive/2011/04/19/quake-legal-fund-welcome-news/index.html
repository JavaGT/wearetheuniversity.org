<p>19 April 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Quake legal fund welcome news</strong></p>
<p>Labour’s Associate Justice spokesperson and Christchurch East MP Lianne Dalziel says a special legal fund being set up by the New Zealand Law Foundation will help many Canterbury people get back on their feet.</p>
<p>“News of the fund --- to be called LawCan --- will be warmly welcomed by Cantabrians who may face complicated legal hurdles as they rebuild their lives,” Lianne Dalziel said.</p>
<p>“I understand that the foundation will be working with Community Law Canterbury and the Law Society to determine how the funds will be allocated. One thing is for sure, there will be plenty of opportunities.</p>
<p>“Already Christchurch people in particular are finding themselves dealing with a range of often complex issues --- involving insurance companies, local authorities, contractors and employment matters --- with which they need professional help,” Lianne Dalziel said.</p>
<p>“When they are already struggling post-quake to deal with day-to-day problems like shelter, schooling, heating, draining and sewerage, for example, legal problems on top of all that can seem insurmountable.</p>
<p>“LawCan will be a saviour for many people”</p>
<p>Lianne Dalziel said she was also pleased to note that the fund would be used to help individual lawyers and law firms.</p>
<p>“Legal businesses are no different to many others. Lawyers affected by the earthquake also need help and support getting back on their feet.”</p>
