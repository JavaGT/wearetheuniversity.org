<p><strong>Erratic English loses plot on wages</strong></p>
<p>Finance Minister Bill English has lost the plot, pushing the case for New Zealand to be a low-wage economy, says Labour’s Finance spokesperson David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>David Cunliffe said the Finance Minister’s comments at the Australia-New Zealand Leadership Forum and on a weekend television programme have raised huge concerns about the Government’s lack of a plan to create jobs and raise incomes.</p>
<p>“Bill English, John Key and company promised in 2008 to close the wage gap with Australia. They have failed. Instead it has blown out to more than 34 percent.</p>
<p>“Rather than honestly admitting that failure --- surely even Bill English can’t believe in himself any longer ---- and adopting a plan to lift wages and growth, National is trying to spin its way out of its embarrassment.</p>
<p>“By arguing the advantages of a low-wage economy, Bill English has turned into a dead end street, and sadly he’s taking hundreds of thousands of Kiwis with him. I don’t know any low-wage Kiwi who sees that status as an advantage!</p>
<p>“We will never, and should never, aim to compete with an emerging Asian economy on low wages,” David Cunliffe said. “To do so would be a social and economic tragedy.</p>
<p>“Mr English’s comments have become increasingly erratic over recent weeks. He has:</p>
<p>• Wanted to borrow the entire cost of earthquake recovery, and now plans a ‘zero budget’;<br>• Advocated austerity, but funds seat-warmers for his BMW fleet, a tupperwaka for Pita Sharples, and sly deals with media companies and film studios;<br>• Blew the budget for South Canterbury Finance by more than $700 million, largely through his own poor decisions;<br>• Gave a blank cheque to AMI, without knowing the costs or the state of the company.</p>
<p>“All the while Kiwis are doing it tough, and finding it harder to make ends meet,” David Cunliffe said.<br><strong>ends</strong></p>
