<p><strong>Friday, 8 April 2011, 7:25 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>08 April 2011</strong><br><strong>Key Notes: Supporting AMI Policyholders</strong><br>From the moment the earthquake struck, the Government has given its full support to Canterbury.<br>That&#39;s why Finance Minister Bill English announced a <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15135.link">back-up support package for AMI Insurance policyholders yesterday</a> . It&#39;s about giving tens of thousands of policyholders the certainty they need and making sure the rebuilding of Canterbury is not delayed.<br>The Government will invest in AMI only as a last resort and we&#39;ll take every possible step to minimise the cost. If AMI is unable to raise capital itself, as a last resort the company would ask the Government to invest up to $500 million of equity in AMI, with the right to take ownership and control of the company.<br>We&#39;ll know more about the full extent of claims AMI faces in the months ahead, so I&#39;ll keep you posted.<br>National is committed to rebuilding Canterbury. Other recent steps we&#39;ve taken include the creation of <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15136.link">a new government agency to lead the rebuilding efforts</a>, and the <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15137.link">extension of our business and employment assistance packages</a>.<br><strong>CONDOLENCES TO ROGER KIRK&#39;S FAMILY</strong><br>I was saddened by <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15138.link">Roger Kirk&#39;s sudden and tragic death</a> on Wednesday. I knew Roger well and he was a good friend of the National Party. My thoughts are with Roger&#39;s family and friends.<br><strong>VISITING TAUPO</strong><br><a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15139.link"></a><br>Yesterday I was in Taupo, which is a great part of the country. I chatted to workers at the Tenon sawmill, caught up with Dairy Business Conference attendees, and met the great residents and staff at Summerset Retirement Village.<br><a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15139.link">Click here</a> to check out some photos of my visit.<br><strong>BUILDING A STRONGER ECONOMY</strong><br>National is pressing on with its comprehensive economic plan and working hard to build the foundations for a stronger economy. At the beginning of this month a few changes came in:<br>• We cut company tax to 28 per cent.<br>• Our employment law package came into effect, including the <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15140.link">extension of the successful 90-day trial period</a>.<br>• <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15141.link">Benefits and pensions increased to keep pace with rising costs</a>.<br>These changes are about creating jobs, boosting incomes, and protecting our most vulnerable.<br><strong>TACKLING BULLYING</strong><br>One of my priorities as Prime Minister is making sure Kiwi kids get the opportunities they need to reach their full potential. That&#39;s why National is taking a tough stance on bullying in schools. I&#39;m determined that we&#39;ll do everything possible to make sure schools are as safe as possible for our young people.<br>Education Minister Anne Tolley has written to all boards of trustees to reaffirm their responsibilities. We want boards and school principals to work together to make sure they have a good plan in place to tackle bullying.<br><strong>MAKING OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER</strong><br>Police Minister Judith Collins recently announced that recorded <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15142.link">crime dropped last year by 6.7 per cent</a>. This is good news for New Zealanders and a credit to our law enforcement officers.<br>National is relentlessly focused on tackling crime and making our communities safer. We&#39;re committed to addressing the problem of crime in this country and we&#39;re making good progress.<br><strong>FROM MY DIARY</strong><br>Next week I&#39;m speaking at the Age Concern conference in Wellington on Tuesday, I&#39;ll be in Christchurch on Thursday and Rotorua on Friday, and I&#39;m off to the V8s next Saturday.<br>Best wishes,</p>
