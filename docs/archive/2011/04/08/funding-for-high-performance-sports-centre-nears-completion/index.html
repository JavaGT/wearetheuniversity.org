<h3>Funding for high performance sports centre nears the finish line</h3>
<p>The $43M redevelopment of Auckland’s new high performance centre was unveiled today by Sport and Recreation Minister Murray McCully, but more financial backing is needed to complete expansion of the facilities.</p>
<p>Located on Auckland’s North Shore, the high performance centre at AUT Millennium campus is touted as a world-class centre of excellence, but further funds are needed to realise the vision says Mike Stanley, CEO of the AUT Millennium Trust and President of the New Zealand Olympic Committee.</p>
<p>“To date, we have been humbled by the response of those who have backed this project. But we are still in fundraising mode and are seeking the support of others passionate about New Zealand’s success and on creating an aspirational high performance culture of excellence where the focus is being exceptional.”</p>
<p>In June 2010, Government announced $15M of funding for the high performance centre, complementing AUT University’s $18M to form a joint venture with the Millennium Institute of Sport and Health. The new centre will be jointly run by AUT Millennium Trust – a 50-50 partnership between AUT and the Millennium Institute.</p>
<p>Stanley says that although New Zealand is a proud sporting nation, success in an increasingly competitive world requires significant investment. So far, that investment has come from Government, AUT, North Shore City Council, Owen Glenn, ASB Community Trust, Sir David Levene and the Lion Foundation.</p>

<p>“The redevelopment is a collaboration between public and private funders who share the vision of taking high performance sport in New Zealand to a new level,” he says.</p>
<p>At a ceremony today to mark the $43M redevelopment, Minister McCully said the Government’s vision for high performance sport was to make New Zealand one of the most successful sporting nations in the world.</p>
<p>“This is really a team effort, and it’s great to be able to share this occasion with many of the people and organisations who’ve also made contributions to make this redevelopment a reality. We’re keen to work with private sector investors, with local government and with philanthropic funders who share that vision.”</p>
<p>Vice Chancellor of AUT University Derek McCormack, says the partnership between AUT University and the Millennium Institute of Sport and Health will help drive the development of high performance sport in New Zealand through education, research and coaching.</p>
<p>“The new centre brings together the best of sports science research, coaching and management expertise. Work being conducted at AUT Millennium is of benefit not only to high performance athletes and coaches but also to community health and education. Our research will impact on the future health and performance of our nation, not just in sporting performance at the elite level, but at all dimensions of human potential.”</p>
<p>Part of the developments include the establishment of a world centre of physical activity, nutrition, coaching and sports science which would deliver programmes in exercise, nutrition, lifestyle, resilience and leadership, helping to create healthier communities.</p>
<p>The first stage $26M redevelopment provides over 6000m2 of new floor space. Overall developments include a 50m Olympic swimming pool, the creation of a high performance zone, a new public health and fitness centre, a human potential centre which specialises in developing nutrition and physical activity, a coaching performance centre, a sports science centre incorporating an environmental chamber and a strength and conditioning suite; expanded medical and specialist facilities, significant additional office, education and meeting facilities; and additional accommodation.</p>
<p>Developments at the high performance centre are due for completion by early 2012, in time for athletes who are preparing for the London Olympics.</p>
