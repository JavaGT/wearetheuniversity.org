<p>Popular New Zealand Food Awards now an annual event</p>
<p>For the first time the New Zealand Food Awards will be held annually and plans are well underway for this year’s Gala Dinner.</p>
<p>The move follows the success of the refreshed 2010 awards and reflects the growth and interest in food innovation and excellence by New Zealand’s largest export sector.</p>
<p>This year the Gala Awards Dinner will be held in conjunction with the Food &amp; Beverage Business Expo at the Viaduct Events Centre in Auckland on Thursday October 20 and takes place during the Taste of New Zealand food festival in Auckland.</p>
<p>The awards aim to support innovation and creativity by recognising companies who achieve excellence. They also recognise company leaders who inspire others to meet their standards of excellence.</p>
<p>Massey University is the principal sponsor of the NZ Food Awards and is the hub of food innovation in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Professor Richard Archer is Head of Massey’s Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health and is passionate about the quality of our food products, “Massey University has been supporting New Zealand’s food and beverage industry for more than 80 years; it has a commitment to provide innovative responses and solutions across the value chain.”</p>
<p>The Awards recognise creativity within the industry, both in product development and in enterprise, food safety and packaging. Winners will be selected on the basis of excellence and innovation.</p>
<p>“We want to support the industry further by recognising and promoting excellence, and supporting the New Zealand economy by assisting the industry to move from commodities to high value premium foods,” says Professor Archer.</p>
<p>Entries for the awards will open shortly. Please visit <a href="http://foodawards.massey.ac.nz/default.asp">http://foodawards.massey.ac.nz/default.asp</a> to find out more about how to enter.</p>
