<p><strong>EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY UNTIL 1.30pm 15th April 2011</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt. Hon Winston Peters</strong><br><strong>Leader NZ First</strong></p>
<p><strong>April 15th 2011</strong></p>
<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dairy Farms Sale Overseas is “Treason” - Peters</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First says reports of another potential sale of the 8,000 hectares of Crafar dairy farms to foreign interests amounts to a form of treason, which must be stopped.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters told a GreyPower audience in Levin today that good dairy land in the world was at a premium and New Zealand simply could not keep letting its resources fall into foreign hands.</p>
<p>“Needless to say Chinese interests have again targeted the Crafar farms as part of their long term campaign to build up and control food supply resources around the world.</p>
<p>“They know this National led government has no loyalty to its citizens and even less regard for the generations of New Zealanders still to come.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters warned that no matter what sort of public relations spin was put on the purchase, the fact remained that a large part of New Zealand&#39;s dairy industry would be controlled from Beijing.</p>
<p>“And dont forget the idiotic Free Trade Agreement with China (which NZ First opposed) means that Chinese interests can start manufacturing here and bring in their own workers.</p>
<p>“This deal must be stopped. New Zealanders need to own their own country and we suggest the Cullen fund be used to buy the farms and lease them out to local farmers.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters pointed out that Chinese interests were donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to National&#39;s election campaign and he said it appeared that payback time was on the horizon.</p>
<p>“We urge New Zealanders of all political persuasions and beliefs to fight against this sale and send a clear message to this shortsighted government,” said Mr Peters.</p>
