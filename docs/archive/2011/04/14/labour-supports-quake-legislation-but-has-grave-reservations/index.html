<p>COSGROVE</p>
<p>Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson</p>
<p>MP for Waimakariri  </p>
<p>14 April 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Labour supports quake legislation but has grave reservations</strong></p>
<p>The botched handling of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority legislation, which essentially gives the Government wartime powers, raises grave concerns that it will not deliver for Cantabrians, says Labour’s Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
<p>“Labour is supporting the legislation but we are deeply concerned about the obscene way it has been rushed through Parliament by Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee without the proper checks and balances,” said Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
<p>“We had a chance to get this critically important piece of legislation right. That opportunity has been wasted by Gerry Brownlee who was just hell-bent on ramming through a law without proper scrutiny.</p>
<p>“Experts were only given a few hours to prepare their evidence on the bill. Their submissions were rushed through in just 4 hours and 40 minutes. Gerry Brownlee rejected every one of Labour’s amendments. He only gave MPs a copy of his own proposed changes four hours after the detailed debate had already begun, leaving little time to actually scrutinise the Supplementary Order Paper.</p>
<p>“Gerry Brownlee has steamrollered over everyone who has tried to make sure this legislation delivers for Cantabrians He will be held accountable for this and must accept responsibility for any future failure.</p>
<p>“Labour has approached this process in good faith. We want the best outcome for Cantabrians and despite our grave concerns, we will continue to work with the Government to try and make this legislation work for the good of all our communities.”</p>
