<p><strong>Government makes a pig’s ear of biosecurity risks</strong></p>
<p>The Government’s decision to relax border standards for the importation of pig meat places the New Zealand pork industry at unacceptable risk, said the Green Party today.</p>
<p>“The Government has relaxed importation standards on pork, which places New Zealand pigs at risk of contracting a debilitating disease Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS),” said Green Party biosecurity spokesperson Kevin Hague.</p>
<p>Mr Hague was responding to the Government update yesterday to Import Heath standards for pig meat, pig meat products and by-products from Canada, the EU, Mexico and the USA places in which PRRS is present.</p>
<p>“New Zealand does not have PRRS, and currently pork imported from countries with PRRS must undergo treatment to deactivate the PRRS disease. However, under the new standards, this treatment will no longer occur,” said Mr Hague.</p>
<p>“The Government has made these changes despite advice from Massey University scientists who state that importation of raw pig meat from countries with PRRS involves substantial risk that the disease will become established in New Zealand within a few years.</p>
<p>“We should support our primary industries, not expose them to risk of costly biosecurity incursions.</p>
<p>“These changes threaten our 100% pure brand, which is worth billions to the New Zealand economy.</p>
<p>“The Government should be working to enhance the perception of New Zealand as a disease-free producer of quality products, not undermine our brand by relaxing safety standards.”</p>

<p>Mr Hague also commented that relaxing the biosecurity standard was effectively subsidising imported pork, making things harder for New Zealand pork farmers to convert to humane animal welfare practices.</p>
<p>“These changes are not good for the New Zealand economy, animal welfare, or consumers,” said Mr Hague.</p>
