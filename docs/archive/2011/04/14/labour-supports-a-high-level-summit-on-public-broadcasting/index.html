<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Labour Supports a High Level Summit on Public Broadcasting</strong></p>
<p>The nation’s top thinkers, business leaders, politicians, academics and senior media industry figures should converge to discuss the future of public broadcasting and media in New Zealand, says Labour’s Broadcasting spokesperson Clare Curran.</p>
<p>Clare Curran said Labour welcomed a call for action by 60 of our finest media experts to urgently address the crisis public broadcasting faces in New Zealand. “An open letter of concern was sent to the Prime Minister and several of his Ministers expressing alarm and sadness at the reality that New Zealand has become a country with an unhealthy media environment.</p>
<p>“The letter called for a review of funding and regulatory needs for New Zealand television which Labour would encourage.</p>
<p>“Recent government decisions to axe on-going funding to TVNZ 7 and to force TVNZ to ditch its public broadcasting role and be solely commercial is further evidence of an absolute lack of commitment or regard for public broadcasting in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The Government has declined TVNZ requests for direct funding to keep TVNZ7 running, at the same time as it has made life easier for its competitors in the private sector. “This snub to public broadcasters runs parallel to the Government initiated bailout of Mediaworks with a $43 million low interest deferred payment for its radio spectrum licence.</p>
<p>“Labour agrees that public service television is essential to an informed society and looks forward to an informed, impartial debate of the issues,” Clare Curran said.</p>
