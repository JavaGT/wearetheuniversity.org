<p><strong>Massey Appoints Top Level Finance Manager</strong></p>
<p>Massey University’s new Assistant Vice-Chancellor has an extensive professional background as well as a recent academic career lecturing undergraduate and postgraduate students at Victoria University.</p>
<p>Rose Anne MacLeod, from Wellington, has been appointed Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Finance, Strategy and Information Technology). She joins the University on May 9.</p>
<p>Ms MacLeod grew up in Katikati, graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce from Auckland University in 1980, has a Master of Business Administration with distinction from Massey (1993) and completed the Advanced Management Programme at Harvard Business School in 2001. She is a Chartered Accountant and a Fellow Chartered Practising Accountant of Australia. She has two teenage sons.</p>
<p>After working in the private sector, she was recruited from London to work for the New Zealand Treasury on the reform of central government. She held a variety of roles over nine years, including chief financial analyst and director of finance and planning. She then worked in Melbourne as chief financial officer for two large Australian organisations before returning to New Zealand to work as the Ministry of Education’s chief financial officer. For the past five years she has been at Victoria lecturing primarily master’s and honours programmes in accounting and public sector financial management as well as consulting in these areas. She is deputy chair of the board of Wellington Free Ambulance.</p>

<p>Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says Massey is extremely fortunate to welcome a new member of the senior leadership team with such a strong background in financial leadership, public and private sector management and first-hand knowledge of the tertiary sector.</p>
<p>“I doubt there is anyone more qualified for the role,” Mr Maharey says. “Rose Anne joins Massey at an exciting time in our development, as we embrace the challenge of helping lead New Zealand to make a difference in global education. All our goals depend heavily on prudent financial management and developing new sources of income.”</p>
<p>Ms MacLeod says she is looking forward to her new role. “Massey’s MBA programme is where I learned many of the core business skills that I have been able to apply in my career. I understand the challenges faced by large organisations and the need for a sound strategic and technological base for universities to thrive and deliver what the world needs.”</p>
