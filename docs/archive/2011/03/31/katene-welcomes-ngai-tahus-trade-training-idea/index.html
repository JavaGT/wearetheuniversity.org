<p><strong>MEDIA STATEMENT</strong><br><strong>Rahui Katene</strong><br><strong>Maori Party MP for Te Tai Tonga (includes Christchurch)</strong><br><strong>31 March 2011</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Katene welcomes Ngai Tahu’s trade training idea</strong></p>
<p>The Maori Party MP for Te Tai Tonga Rahui Katene will be putting all her support behind Ngai Tahu’s idea to use the reconstruction in Christchurch to set up the country’s largest Maori trade training programme.</p>
<p>“There are more than 400 Maori youth on the unemployment benefit in our city. And it makes sense to me to give them the opportunity to arm themselves with skills that they can use to help rebuild their city, get off the benefit and feed their whanau,” Mrs Katene said.</p>
<p>“The Maori Party has always been an advocate of Maori trade training programmes and the reconstruction has opened a window of opportunity for that to happen.</p>
<p>“Our caucus is looking at how we can use our influence in Parliament to connect Ngai Tahu with the relevant ministers to achieve their idea.</p>
<p>“If any iwi can get a project like this up and running it will be Ngai Tahu because they have a proven track record of innovation, focusing on vulnerable youth and they are also the biggest land owner in Canterbury. We’re totally behind them.”</p>
<p>Mrs Katene said during the 1960s the hostel at Rehua Marae in Christchurch drew young Maori doing trade training from all over the country.</p>
<p>“In the classic expression of manaakitanga, Ngai Tahu played host to the young sons from iwi many miles away. The extent of their success was that they secured employment, set up businesses, took on further training and built many homes in the city.”  </p>
