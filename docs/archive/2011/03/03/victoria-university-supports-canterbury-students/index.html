<p>Victoria University supports Canterbury students</p>
<p>During this national disaster, Victoria University of Wellington recognises the need to provide short-term assistance to Canterbury students.</p>
<p>Applications from Canterbury university students wishing to transfer for Trimester One are currently being processed and will be accepted where possible according to space constraints.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been fielding a number of enquiries from students since shortly after the Canterbury earthquake and are trying to provide advice and assistance where possible. If we have space in our programmes and courses, we have been accepting these students for Trimester One,&quot; says Student Academic Services Director Pam Thorburn.</p>
<p>&quot;We realise this is a difficult time for all those in Canterbury and for students considering their options in the short-term.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been advised by the University of Canterbury and Lincoln University that they will be providing a full academic year study programme and we will be advising students to keep in close contact with those universities to ensure their options remain open for study in 2011 and beyond.</p>
<p>&quot;Our plan is to keep track of this group of students during their time at Victoria in order to offer them support and to keep them informed of progress at their original institutions.&quot;</p>
<p>University students wishing to transfer must contact the Victoria enrolments team as soon as possible on 0800 Victoria (option 1). Applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis and there is no guarantee of entry into a chosen programme or courses.</p>
<p>While applications can be processed via telephone, enrolment will need to be completed in person before Friday 11 March in Wellington.</p>
