<p><strong>AUT University support for displaced students</strong></p>
<p>AUT University has been responding to enquiries from Christchurch students who need to consider their options following the Canterbury earthquake.</p>
<p>“Some Christchurch students have been completely displaced due to loss of accommodation, family moves and other impacts of the disaster,” said Vice-Chancellor Derek McCormack. “AUT wishes to help displaced students continue to undertake their studies in 2011 with minimal disadvantage.”</p>
<p>AUT will grant University of Canterbury, Lincoln University or Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (CPIT) students extraordinary circumstances admissions - subject to places being available and students meeting minimum entry requirements. This will allow students to undertake studies either temporarily, with the aim of returning to Christchurch, or if their circumstances demand it, for the duration of the course.</p>
<p>AUT will aim to make places available in programmes that best match a student’s current or intended studies wherever possible, and will make every effort to ensure that credit will be accepted by the Christchurch institutions for students who can return when their situation settles. A range of options are being explored, including treating the AUT study as an exchange with the home institution.</p>
<p>AUT has set up dedicated academic and personal support for affected students to allow them to re-engage with study as soon as possible, including assistance with obtaining accommodation.</p>

<p>McCormack emphasised that there is no question Canterbury, Lincoln and CPIT will all be operating and Canterbury and Lincoln intend to deliver a full academic year. He urged all students to ensure they are fully aware of these arrangements before making a decision on alternatives.</p>
<p>McCormack said that AUT did not expect to receive any funding for extra students taken under the extraordinary circumstances admissions for 2011.</p>
<p>“For a short time AUT will cope with the extra cost. As the nation comes together in support of the recovery I believe it is important that AUT, with other institutions, does whatever it can to help affected students settle into their study as soon as possible.”<br>AUT is also working with the Christchurch institutions to provide other support such as allocating facilities where research students can work at AUT campuses while maintaining their enrolments at Canterbury and CPIT.</p>
