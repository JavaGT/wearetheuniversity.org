<p>Ruth DYSON</p>
<p>MP for Port Hills Electorate</p>
<p>Tuesday, 15 March 2011</p>
<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Bromley Hit Hard With News of Factory Closure</strong></p>
<p>The Bromley area today learned that carpet maker Godfrey Hirst New Zealand will not be reopening its Maces Road factory in the Canterbury region, MP for Port Hills Ruth Dyson says</p>
<p>“This is a tragic loss for the region Godfrey Hirst is one of the biggest employers in the area, but extensive earthquake damage has meant it cannot reopen,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>“I understand that engineers have stated the factory simply cannot be fixed.</p>
<p>“Employees have been offered redeployment and while it would be sad to see these people leave Canterbury it is understandable that many will now consider whether they need to move away from the region in order to support their families.</p>
<p>“Godfrey Hirst is a good employer and I hope in time they can find a new suitable site in Canterbury, but today’s news is another tragic blow to an area already reeling.</p>
<p>“This is the second major employer to pull out of my electorate since the earthquake with Foodstuffs previously announcing the closure of two supermarkets because of extensive damage.</p>
<p>“As the electorate MP I am deeply concerned about the on-going effects of this earthquake and will be doing everything I can to support those people who need assistance,” Ruth Dyson said.</p>
