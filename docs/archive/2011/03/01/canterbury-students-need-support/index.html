<p><strong>Canterbury Students Need Support</strong></p>
<p>Canterbury students are in need of urgent leadership from both the Government and tertiary institutions in the aftermath of last week’s tragic earthquake, which has seen many students displaced and may result in significant delays and disruption to the academic year.</p>
<p>“In the past week hundreds of students have understandably been seeking to transfer to alternative universities and polytechnics due their institution being closed, their flats destroyed or because they are traumatised and want and need to return home. Sadly, many of these students are currently being turned away by institutions in other cities,” said Max Hardy, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).</p>
<p>“We are aware that universities and polytechnics, while wanting to support students, may be wary of taking on extra students in a restricted funding environment where sanctions for exceeding enrolment caps can be quite punitive. We are encouraging the Government to ensure there are no such sanctions for institutions that take on extra students due to the effects of the earthquake, that they fund the extra transferring students, and ensure students are not unfairly disadvantaged in their student loan and allowance entitlements,” said Hardy.</p>
<p>It will also be important to provide support for students who wish to stay in Canterbury and to assist the institutions in Christchurch to get up and running as soon as possible. That requires a thorough assessment of the needs to students staying in Canterbury – something that students’ associations are ready to help with.</p>

<p>“It is understandable that there is a focus on ensuring that tertiary institutions in Christchurch are sustainable. But we also need to ensure that students are not being unfairly disadvantaged and that as much as possible is done to support those who have been through such a devastating experience in getting on with rebuilding their lives,” said David Do, NZUSA Co-President.</p>
<p>“Students understand that the priority is rebuilding Christchurch and have been out on the streets helping with the clean up and leading many community responses in the form of the Student Volunteer Army, organising collections, and coordinating donations of goods and emergency accommodation,” said Do.</p>
<p>NZUSA is calling on the Government to support the education of Christchurch students in their hour of need.</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.</p>
