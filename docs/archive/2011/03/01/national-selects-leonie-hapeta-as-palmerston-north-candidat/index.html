<p>National Selects Leonie Hapeta as Palmerston North Candidate</p>
<p>Palmerston North National Party Electorate Chair Trevor Day is pleased to announce Leonie Hapeta will be the Party&#39;s Palmerston North candidate for the general election on November 26.</p>
<p>&quot;We had very high quality candidates putting their names forward. The level of interest underscores the enthusiasm in the Party as we move into the election year contest. I want to thank everyone who has taken part in the process.&quot;</p>
<p>Newly selected candidate Leonie Hapeta says she is humbled by the selection and looks forward to the opportunity of fighting for the privilege to represent the people of Palmerston North in John Key&#39;s Government.</p>
<p>&quot;For our community this election is about giving Palmerston North a strong voice in Government. The sense I get from our community is that it welcomes the comprehensive plan to grow the economy, to start living within our means, deliver enduring jobs, and build the critical infrastructure to future proof New Zealand and our region. I&#39;m also a strong supporter of the Government&#39;s continued focus on law and order - so we can feel safe in our communities and our homes.</p>
<p>&quot;But as we emerge from the recession, and the disaster that has hit Canterbury, it has become even more important for our Government to control debt so future generations of Kiwis don&#39;t have to pick up the pieces from rash promises made in 2011. I admire the Government&#39;s efforts to blunt the sharp edges of the recession for vulnerable Kiwis, and the way the Prime Minister has handled some extremely testing times in his first three years.</p>

<p>&quot;I enter this election contest taking nothing for granted and knowing that I have to earn the respect and trust of an electorate that deserves a strong voice within the National caucus.&quot;</p>
