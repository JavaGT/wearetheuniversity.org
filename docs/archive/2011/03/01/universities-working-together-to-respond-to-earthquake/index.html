<p><strong>Universities Working Together To Respond To The Canterbury Earthquake</strong></p>
<p>Universities New Zealand – Te Pōkai Tara would like to express our deepest sympathy and concern for the people of Christchurch and the broader Canterbury region after last week’s devastating earthquake. At the same time we recognise their incredible resilience, determination and community spirit as they work to recover and rebuild, and we are inspired by the efforts of groups like the Student Volunteer Army.</p>
<p>“We strongly support the intentions of Canterbury, Lincoln and Otago’s Christchurch campus to re-open soon and we are confident in their ability to deliver a quality full-year academic programme of teaching in 2011,” says Universities NZ Chair Derek McCormack. “The universities are of vital importance to the future of the Canterbury region and New Zealand and we look forward to the resumption of teaching as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The universities are especially concerned about the effect the earthquake has had on the staff and students of the University of Canterbury, Lincoln University and the University of Otago’s Christchurch campus.</p>
<p>“Students and their families can be assured that the universities are working together with government agencies to explore all possible avenues to make sure that students will have continuity of study during this difficult time,” says McCormack.</p>
<p>We encourage students to keep in touch with their respective universities for up-to-date news and developments, and to express any concerns they may have about continuing their study. The university websites – <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz">www.canterbury.ac.nz</a>, <a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.nz">www.lincoln.ac.nz</a> and <a href="http://www.otago.ac.nz">www.otago.ac.nz</a> – are updated regularly with the latest information.</p>
<p>The Vice-Chancellors will continue working together to review and respond to developments as the situation evolves.</p>
