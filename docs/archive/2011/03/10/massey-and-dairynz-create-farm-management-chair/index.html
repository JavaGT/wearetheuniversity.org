<p><strong>Massey and DairyNZ Create Farm Management Chair</strong></p>
<p>Massey University and DairyNZ today announced a New Zealand Dairy Industry Chair in Farm Management, a position recognising the importance of primary production to the nation’s economic success.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Nicola Shadbolt from the Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health, has been appointed.</p>
<p>DairyNZ is a promotional organisation representing New Zealand dairy farmers. Chief executive Tim Mackle says Dr Shadbolt is highly regarded for her leadership and expertise in farm business management.</p>
<p>“Building farm management capability in New Zealand is essential for us to meet the challenges ahead, and this position has been created to meet this need,” Mr Mackle says. “Dr Shadbolt is the ideal person to lead this work, combining academic discipline with her own farming interests.”</p>
<p>University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says the partnership with DairyNZ reflects the strong links the University has with the farming community and Massey’s leadership in the application and extension of knowledge in the management of agricultural businesses.</p>
<p>“Farming enterprises have become even more complex, and it is important to New Zealand and to the rural sector that we have people with Dr Shadbolt’s knowledge working to ensure the success of primary production, the rural environment and our agri-businesses,” Mr Maharey says.</p>
<p>College of Sciences Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Robert Anderson says it is important for the University to work with industry to build critical mass of leadership in the field of farm management. “Professor Shadbolt’s appointment ensures the University will continue to work closely with industry,” Professor Anderson says. “In addition to her exceptional contribution in the understanding, advancement and communication of the financial aspects of farming, Dr Shadbolt brings to this role her expertise in farm systems, including soil, plant and animal sciences.”</p>
<p>Dr Shadbolt will be based at the Manawatu campus and will continue as an elected director on the board of the dairy co-operative Fonterra.</p>
