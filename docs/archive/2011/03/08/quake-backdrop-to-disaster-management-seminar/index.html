<p>Quake backdrop to disaster management seminar</p>
<p>The latest Christchurch earthquake will serve as an unavoidable backdrop for a meeting of international emergency management specialists in Wellington this week.</p>
<p>The annual summer institute, run by the Joint Centre for Disaster Research, brings together specialists from Canada, Australia, Turkey and New Zealand for seminars addressing all aspects of disaster management.</p>
<p>The centre is a joint venture between the University and GNS Science. Centre director Dr David Johnston says the institute programme specifically addresses emergency management planning, evacuation planning and welfare. It also examines the role of public education in building resilient communities.</p>
<p>Some of the intending seminar participants have been unable to attend as they are carrying out emergency management work in the earthquake zone, Dr Johnston says. Its aftermath “gives us a framework for the discussion in the context of what happened in Christchurch”, he says.</p>
<p>Tomorrow a case study involving a scenario around planning for a Wellington earthquake will be presented. Other issues being addressed include evacuation planning and welfare provision, with presentations on an introduction to psychosocial recovery, managing animal welfare issues and welfare for disaster workers.</p>
<p>On Thursday participants will be taken on a tour of hazards related to Wellington, including the Wellington fault and tsunami hazard zones, as well as visits to the Wellington and Hutt Valley Emergency Operations Centres.</p>
<p>The week concludes with presentations on Friday examining the role of public education (including schools) in encouraging community engagement and participation before and after a natural disaster.<br>ends  </p>
