<p>Charles<br>CHAUVEL<br>Environment spokesperson</p>
<p>Thursday, 24 March 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>No net gain? No deal.</strong></p>
<p>“There is no net gain for conservation in a deal done between the Department of Conversation and owners of the Porters Ski Area, Labour’s Environment spokesperson Charles Chauvel said today.</p>
<p>The Department of Conservation (DOC) has agreed to a controversial land swap that will enable a $500 million ski field development in Canterbury.</p>
<p>“This deal sets a dangerous precedent and many critics believe that DOC is putting business ahead of conservation values.</p>
<p>“The idea that this deal may create a ‘net gain’ for conservation, which is required in a land swap of this kind, is absurd.</p>
<p>“We are world renowned for our beautiful natural heritage, and the department whose responsibility it is to protect it, is doing the opposite.</p>
<p>“DOC outlines on their own website that one of its goals to ‘manage natural and historic heritage assets for the greatest benefit and enjoyment of all New Zealanders, by conserving, advocating and promoting natural and historic heritage so that its values are passed on undiminished to future generations’.<br>“Clearly DOC’s latest decision goes against its own policy and should be withdrawn and reviewed immediately,” said Charles Chauvel.</p>
