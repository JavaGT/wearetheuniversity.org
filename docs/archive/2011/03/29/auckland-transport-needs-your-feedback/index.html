<p>Auckland Transport is planning to improve bus services around the Auckland CBD and surrounding suburbs to make them quicker and easier to use.</p>
<p>This may have an impact on how you get to University and around the city.  </p>
<p>Changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replacing the City Circuit with an inner city service running every five minutes along Queen St to Karangahape Rd. From Britomart to Auckland and AUT Universities there are buses running at least every five minutes by a faster route than the City Circuit. To make these buses more convenient, we are planning to change the departure stop of the Mt Eden Road b.line service (routes 274 and 277) so that it leaves from the main Britomart entrance on Queen Street. This service operates every 10 minutes and serves all the University stops along Symonds Street. The inner city fare - currently 50 cents - would apply on this service</li>
<li>Changing parts of the LINK route, for example moving it from Victoria and Queen Streets to run direct to the universities area along Wellesley Street. The changes would improve the reliability of the LINK by avoiding areas of high congestion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Auckland Transport needs your feedback to help improve the proposals and tell us if we’ve missed anything. Full details and a feedback form are available at <a href="http://www.maxx.co.nz/centralchanges">www.maxx.co.nz/centralchanges</a>. Consultation closes on Friday 15 April 2011.  </p>
<p>All of the changes will work together to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the frequency, reliability and connectivity of central area bus services</li>
<li>Make bus services that circulate within the Auckland CBD simpler and easier to understand</li>
<li>Better connect the developing Wynyard Quarter</li>
<li>Speed up the LINK, as well as bus services to Ponsonby, Herne Bay, Point Chevalier and other Western Bays suburbs</li>
<li>Better connect more inner Auckland suburbs with the CBD and each other by creating a 15 minute frequency Outer Loop service similar to the LINK. For example connecting shopping areas like St Luke’s with Mt Eden Village and Newmarket.</li>
<li>Make it easier and more comfortable to get around with the introduction of new buses.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases the changes would mean bus passengers need to use a different service or go to a different stop for the service which best suits them.</p>
<p>A map showing the proposed new services and their routes is available to download below.</p>
