<p><strong>Christchurch Earthquake Recovery Authority needs to focus on sustainability</strong></p>
<p>The new Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority established today needs to have a focus on sustainability, said the Green Party.</p>
<p>“People with expertise in sustainability and urban design need to be involved in the new agency from the outset,” said Kennedy Graham, Green Party Spokesperson for the Christchurch Earthquake Recovery.</p>
<p>“Christchurch can be a model of a green city that delivers prosperity and protects the environment. The city can be designed to reflect 21st century values and technology.</p>
<p>“The principles of sustainable design for buildings, transport and green spaces can be used in the Christchurch rebuild.</p>
<p>“We also need to future proof our city and build in resilience to earthquakes, rising oil prices and environmental hazards.</p>
<p>“The agency also needs to listen to the people of Christchurch. It is their lives, homes and city that have been shattered.</p>
<p>“Having the people of Christchurch represented in the authority is vital. While the Government is making the right noises, we will be monitoring the new authority to try and make sure that it is accountable to Cantabrians.</p>
<p>“The new forum of community leaders, which the agency will create and consult, needs to be truly representative to help keep the new authority attuned to the needs and interests of local people. It needs to draw on people from a wide range of backgrounds and not just be handpicked by the National Party.</p>

<p>“Given the extensive powers that this body has under the Canterbury Earthquake Response and Recovery Act, it needs to have cross-party parliamentary oversight. The role of the MP advisory body is unclear and could need to be strengthened,” said Dr Graham.</p>
<p>The Green Party will host public meetings to discuss how best to sustainably rebuild Christchurch. The first meeting will be held on 20 April at the netball centre in Hagley Park.</p>
