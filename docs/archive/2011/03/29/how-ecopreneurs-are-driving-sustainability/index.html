<p>How ‘ecopreneurs’ are driving sustainability</p>
<p>Traditionally, passionate people who wanted to make the world a better place would start a charity or found a non-profit group to sell the idea of change. Today, a growing group of people are using a new business model to sell products that change the world while making a profit.</p>
<p>The motivations driving ‘ecopreneurs’, as they’ve been called, is one of the topics under discussion at the Sustainable Business Network forum being held in Auckland tomorrow [Wednesday March 30].</p>
<p>Associate Professor Eva Collins of the University of Waikato Management School and Chris Morrison, founder of All Good Organics and Phoenix Organics, are co-presenting a ‘how-to’ session for businesses interested in a sustainable business model.</p>
<p>Dr Collins says these business leaders are not interested in simply clipping a few social and environmental initiatives on to the same profit-driven model.</p>
<p>“These people are values driven. Economics is important, but it’s not the most important consideration. They see their businesses as a way to achieve social or environmental change.”</p>
<p>Dr Collins has researched sustainable enterprises and the uptake of sustainable practices by more than 700 New Zealand businesses.</p>
<p>Dr Collins says ecopreneurs provide a counter argument to people who only see business as contributing to social and economic problems.</p>
<p>“Ecopreneurs use commerce to change the world, and are driven by community values,” she says. New Zealand examples include Auckland-based green funeral company State of Grace, eco-friendly bottled water supplier Good Water and Kapai salad bars.</p>

<p>“All these firms have built their businesses by redefining their product and adding to the social fabric.”</p>
<p>She acknowledges this approach requires a completely different mindset. “You can’t tack sustainability on to the traditional take, make and waste business model,” she says.</p>
<p>Dr Collins has some tips for would-be ecopreneurs. “There’s a margin for sustainability features, but it’s a small one, so you must be creative. Typically, ecopreneurs start out by developing a niche market with loyal customers willing to pay more for sustainability features.”</p>
<p>Dr Collins says sustainability can’t be an excuse for lack of financial performance.</p>
<p>“If you want to use your business to change the world, then the first rule is that you must stay in business.”</p>
<p>Her conclusion?</p>
<p>“Ecopreneurs know we can’t follow the same models and expect to find better solutions. They are the necessary critical change agents using the power of commerce to create a sustainable future.”<br>For more details on the SBN forum “Sustainability is Mainstream: Maximising New Zealand’s New Era”, visit <a href="http://www.sustainable.org.nz">www.sustainable.org.nz</a></p>
