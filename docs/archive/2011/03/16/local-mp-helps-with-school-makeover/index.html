<p><strong>Local MP helps with school makeover</strong></p>
<p>On Saturday 12th March, local MP Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga joined over 400 volunteers in association with the Life Centre Trust for an Extreme Makeover for Sylvia Park School.</p>
<p>The Life Centre Trust was inspired by National Random Acts of Kindness Day to select one needy school in the community to give it a complete makeover.</p>
<p>“Our children are the future and I am proud to work alongside the Life Centre Trust once again to make this school and our community a better place for our children,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
<p>Sylvia Park School was chosen as the recipient of the 2011 Extreme School Makeover. Over 2 consecutive Saturdays (5th and 12th March) the school was entirely repainted, there was also extensive work done to the grounds, building exteriors and new gardens installed, with the total cost of the project totalling more than $100,000. Dulux also donated more than 100 litres of paint.</p>
<p>A family fun day was also held where the families and children from the community came along and enjoyed the makeover from a safe distance. There were bouncy castles, face painting, clowns, give-a-ways, sausage sizzles and much more.</p>
<p>“It’s absolutely mind blowing the level of support we have received and I’m so thankful to the Life Centre Trust and the many volunteers and friends that turned out on the day,” Sylvia Park Principal Mrs Ala’alatoa says.</p>

<p>“This makeover will allow us to funnel more of the schools funding that would have gone on maintenance, directly into learning and teaching resources for the students of the school,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
<p>In 2007 Point England School received the Community Makeover. Total cost of this project was approximately $350,000. Approximately 700 volunteers helped on the day.</p>
<p>In 2008 Tamaki Primary School received the Community Makeover. Total cost of the project was approximately $250,000. Approximately 400 volunteers helped on the day. With special guests “mucking in” including Prime Minister John Key, Auckland NPC players and a visit from the New Zealand Breakers basketball team donating a new basketball hoop and basketballs.</p>
<p>In 2010 Glenbrae School received the Community Makeover. With the help of over 600 volunteers over 2 consecutive Saturdays they managed to paint the entire school, install a brand new playground, build new seating areas, install shade sails over the swimming pool.</p>
<p>“In the end it’s about the students and about giving them a great facility to play, learn and succeed to the best of their potential. The Life Centre Trust is doing great work and I can’t wait to be involved in the next school makeover,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
