<h3>Fruit and health specialist becomes adjunct professor</h3>
<p>Food and health scientist Professor Margot Skinner’s work on understanding the health benefits of fruit has led to her appointment as an adjunct professor at the University.</p>
<p>Professor Skinner, a principal scientist in the Food Innovation Portfolio at the crown research institute Plant and Food Research in Mt Albert, Auckland, will be working mainly with the Albany campus, teaching in the Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health.</p>
<p>Institute head Professor Richard Archer says Professor Skinner is highly regarded nationally and internationally for her work in immunology and on defining health benefits from foods.</p>
<p>“Professor Skinner’s expertise will enhance our teaching programmes, particularly in the areas of immuno-nutrition, gut health and nutrigenomics,” Professor Archer says. “Also, she will continue to be involved with our postgraduate students and their projects.”</p>
<p>Her research interests include general and nutritional immunology, the methodology required to identify health benefits of food, particularly fruit and vegetables, and the development of prototype functional foods with validated health benefits. She also leads the Wellness Foods programme.</p>
<p>Professor Skinner is regularly invited to speak at international conferences about immunology, functional foods and nutrigenomics. She is a visiting professor at the University of Shizuoka in Japan, regularly consults for international companies and has published more than 100 papers in international peer reviewed journals and book chapters. She is also an inventor on two United States patents.</p>

<p>Finding out about what we eat and how it keeps us well is important to Professor Skinner. She says the stronger links between the University and Plant and Food Research, particularly in Auckland around research and teaching in nutrition have excellent potential. “There’s very good work being done and there will be many benefits from working together. The future of food is very much about health and nutrition and there is much we can do together.”</p>
