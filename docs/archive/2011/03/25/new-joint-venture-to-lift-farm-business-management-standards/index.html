<h3>New Joint Venture to Lift Farm Business Management Standards</h3>
<p>A new venture aimed at improving the quality of farm business management in New Zealand is being launched today (March 25).</p>
<p>The Centre of Excellence in Farm Business Management is a joint venture by Lincoln and Massey universities, with the support of DairyNZ and the Government through the Primary Growth Partnership.</p>
<p>It will combine capability from both universities and co-ordinate the supply of research, education and professional development to meet the agriculture industry’s needs.</p>
<p>DairyNZ chief executive Dr Tim Mackle says there is a real need to address farm management capability in New Zealand as it is an area that has been sorely neglected in the past 25 years. “It’s not about creating another bricks and mortar institution, but rather working together to meet a crucial gap,” Dr Mackle says. “Capability in this area is essential to an industry which needs to manage a style of productivity growth that does not increase our environmental footprint, whatever type of agriculture.”</p>
<p>Lincoln University Vice-Chancellor Professor Roger Field says the centre will co-ordinate the research and educational paths of the two universities to meet industry needs. “It will also provide a co-ordinated front for industry engagement,” Professor Field says. “For example, if there is a regional need for a programme in the South Island, the centre can deliver this. It’s about using the best New Zealand and international talent to deliver as required.”</p>

<p>Massey University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says the centre is an ideal vehicle for Lincoln and Massey to join forces. “New Zealand has an incredibly strong heritage in this space, but it has declined in terms of the scale of activity,” Mr Maharey says. “Now is the perfect time to act so we can act in areas where there are new opportunities for both organisations.”</p>
<p>The centre’s establishment is part of DairyNZ’s activities under the Government’s Primary Growth Partnership programme. In August last year, substantial Government-industry funding was committed to a seven-year programme of innovation, aimed at helping drive transformational change in the primary sector.<br>The centre’s primary focus will be on improving the business of farming in New Zealand; focusing on areas such as risk management, governance, financial control, people management, entrepreneurship and precision agriculture.</p>
<p>A director will be appointed to lead the centre, but capability will remain at each university, with expertise contracted as required.</p>
<p>It will be officially launched at 3pm today at the International Farm Management Congress in Methven by Dr Mackle, Professor Field and Mr Maharey.</p>
