<p>“These are difficult times for our country and we need strong and decisive leadership. I look forward to the campaign ahead and the opportunity to once again serve my community in a John Key led Government.</p>
<p>“Maungakiekie is at the heart of Auckland’s diversity and represents the vibrant and bustling change of metropolitan Auckland, with the iconic One Tree Hill as its jewel. I’m proud to be this communities voice in Parliament.</p>
<p>“During my first term, we have reopened the Onehunga Rail line, opened the Manukau Harbour crossing, opened a Services Academy at Tamaki College and have opened a new operating theatre for elective surgery in Greenlane. We also saw thousands of our young people take part in the “Breakaway” youth initiatives and have invested millions of dollars in new funding for our local schools.</p>

I will also continue to work with community groups on the Ellerslie Racecourse re-development and the AMETI projects.</p>
<p>“I am humbled by all those who have put their faith and trust in me. I look forward to building on that support and to campaign on the vision and aspirations that John Key has set for our country,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.<br>Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga is the Deputy-Chairman of the Commerce Select Committee and a member of the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee.
