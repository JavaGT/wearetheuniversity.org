<p><strong>EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt. Hon Winston Peters</strong><br><strong>Leader NZ First</strong></p>
<p>Address to: Ashburton Grey Power<br>Seniors Centre, Cameron St, Ashburton</p>
<p>Date: 21st March 2011<br>Time: 2pm</p>
<p><strong>Recession</strong>  </p>
<p>The worldwide recession is not your fault.</p>
<p>It was caused by the greedies in the banking and finance industry.</p>
<p>To make extra profits and to earn huge bonuses, US financiers created a scheme by which they packaged shonky mortgages and sold them as prime investments.</p>
<p>As well, banks and finance houses in many parts of the Western world went on a lending spree that pushed up property prices, creating a big bubble that burst.</p>
<p>Governments and ordinary people were left to clean up the mess. The cleaning up is continuing and it will take a long time.</p>
<p>Not content with crashing the democratic world&#39;s financial systems, the greedies are back in action gambling on the price of commodities.</p>
<p>Food, oil, whatever you can think of is being bought and sold many times before it even gets to the factory that processes it.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a new way for the greedies behind computer screens to suck billions out of the pockets of ordinary people.</p>
<p>You are at the bottom of the food chain.</p>
<p>It&#39;s called “globalisation” and you&#39;ll hear just about every so-called financial expert saying what a good thing it is.</p>
<p>What they really mean is that it is a good thing for them.</p>
<p>The New Zealand economy is the plaything of international currency traders and speculators.</p>

<p>Our currency is one of the most volatile on the planet.</p>
<p>We keep hearing about the virtues of the free market. Trouble is it&#39;s not free to the families trying to make do on low incomes or pensioners facing a long cold winter with big power bills.</p>
<p><strong>Budget</strong></p>
<p>You are being softened up for cuts in social spending in the next Budget.</p>
<p>Every day the Prime Minister and senior cabinet ministers tell the nation how bad things are.</p>
<p>And every day a new figure of ten, fifteen, twenty billion is thrown about as the amount of extra money the government will need.</p>
<p>This is a clear signal that more state assets will be sold than the government is letting on.</p>
<p>Surely someone, somewhere in this government knows the folly of selling state assets.</p>
<p>For example, the state companies that generate electricity are going to be partially privatised.</p>
<p>Now why would anyone of sane mind sell off its only renewable sources of energy.</p>
<p>Make no mistake.</p>
<p>If our power stations are part of a public share float they will end up owned overseas.</p>
<p>Probably by China because China is one of the few countries that are in the black.</p>
<p>Why are they in the black?</p>
<p>Because they are a one party state with a planned economy, a strictly controlled workforce and a forest of factories handed over by industrial leaders in the West.</p>
<p>They&#39;ve gone to China because manufacturing is cheaper where the workers get paid a few dollars and a bowl of rice a day.</p>
<p>So why would we hand over our energy generating resources?</p>
<p>Between 1984 and 1996 Labour and National governments privatised and sold off huge chunks of state owned assets.</p>
<p>They were sold for a song and companies like Telecom have made a killing for their overseas owners.  </p>
<p><strong>NZ First</strong>  </p>
<p>The most important party for senior citizens for the next few years will be New Zealand First.</p>
<p>People in powerful places have decided that our party stands in the way of their grand designs so they have tried to take us out.</p>
<p>If we were gone your pension would be reduced tomorrow and your SuperGold card would be worthless.</p>
<p>As well, the age of eligibility would be lifted.</p>
<p>We are your insurance so don’t forget to pay it!</p>
<p>And remember we are extending the SuperGold card into senior medical care next year when we get back.</p>
<p>There will be a free medical; check each year for over 65s and doctors visits will be capped at ten dollars.<br>We cannot continue with a situation in which elderly people cannot afford to go to the doctor.  </p>
<p><strong>Position For Election</strong>  </p>
<p><em><strong>So let me explain what our position is for the election this year.</strong></em>  </p>
<p><em><strong>If you don’t want to vote for National, vote for New Zealand First.</strong></em>  </p>
<p><em><strong>If you don’t want to vote for Labour, vote for New Zealand First.</strong></em>  </p>
<p><em><strong>If you don’t want the others, vote for New Zealand First.</strong></em>  </p>
<p><em><strong>If we have to, and if that is what NZ First decides, we will be pleased to sit on the cross benches guarding the interests of ALL New Zealanders.</strong></em>  </p>
<p><em><strong>We have done it before.</strong></em>  </p>
<p><em><strong>National and Labour can look after themselves.</strong></em>  </p>
<p><em><strong>We will support legislation that&#39;s in line with New Zealand First policies.</strong></em>  </p>
<p><em><strong>And we will always support any policy or idea that&#39;s good for the country – no matter where it comes from.</strong></em>  </p>
<p><em><strong>We have done it before.</strong></em>  </p>
<p><em><strong>In return we will expect support for our initiatives.</strong></em>  </p>
<p><em><strong>This makes our position clear.</strong></em>  </p>
<p><em><strong>No pre-election deals, no nudge-nudge, wink-wink political horse trading before you the voters have spoken.</strong></em>  </p>
<p><em><strong>Those who argue for pre-election deals are trying to weaken your vote.</strong></em>  </p>
<p><em><strong>Don’t let them.</strong></em>  </p>
<p><em><strong>Instead of doing pre-election deals, we will concentrate on the big issues facing New Zealanders.</strong></em>  </p>
<p>You were promised before the last election there would be no increase in GST.</p>
<p>That&#39;s right – you will find the clip on YouTube in which John Key says National would not increase GST.</p>
<p>To that we say ...yeah right!</p>
<p>If we look back at that exercise in tax fiddles this is what happened.  </p>
<p><em><strong>The wealthy people at the top – the people this government looks after did very well.</strong></em></p>
<p>Look for example, as the boss of the Australian bank Westpac in New Zealand.</p>
<p>His salary is $5.6 million dollars.</p>
<p>When John Key handed out his tax cuts – the bank boss got more than $5,000 a week extra.</p>
<p>That&#39;s right $5,000 a week extra because of his tax cut.</p>
<p>Now for the unfairness of it all.</p>
<p>National recently lifted the minimum wage by 25 cents an hour to $13 an hour.</p>
<p>That means someone on the minimum wage – and there are thousands of them – now receives just over $27,000 a year.</p>
<p>That amounts to about $437 a week take home pay.</p>
<p>It&#39;s easy to see the people this government is looking after.</p>
<p>If you are a bank boss on $5.6million, helping cause a recession, you get an extra five thousand a week.</p>
<p>If you are on the minimum wage – you get an extra 25 cents an hour.</p>
<p>And hope you don’t have too far to walk to the local foodbank.</p>
<p>This policy also hits the pockets of those people receiving the pension.</p>
<p><em><strong>If pay rates are kept down, your superannuation payments are kept down as well.</strong></em>  </p>
<p>And here&#39;s something else to think about. How can a single pensioner live on just over $330 a week in these times of explosive food prices, rising power costs, rising petrol costs and government charges that go up every time you look at them?</p>
<p>Times are tough through no fault of your own. And we commend those thousands of New Zealanders who look after each other and help each other out.</p>
<p>You paid your dues while in the workforce. You raised your kids, did work for the community and kept your side of the bargain.</p>
<p>Now you are regarded as a public expense when you really are a public asset. Each and every one of you.</p>
<p>Your parents and their parents tried to make this country special. WE led the world in social advances.</p>
<p>It is our duty to restore our country to the caring egalitarian society they were proud of.</p>
<p>WE CAN do it again. Help us make it happen.</p>
