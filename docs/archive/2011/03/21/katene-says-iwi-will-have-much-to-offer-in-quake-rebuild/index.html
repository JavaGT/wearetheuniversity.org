<p>MEDIA STATEMENT<br>Rahui Katene<br>Maori Party MP<br>21 March 2011</p>
<p>Katene says innovative iwi will have much to offer in quake rebuild</p>
<p>The Maori Party MP in Christchurch Rahui Katene says Ngai Tahu will have much to offer the Government and the city as the journey of rebuilding begins.</p>
<p>On TVNZ&#39;s Q + A programme yesterday, Prime Minister John Key indicated that the Government would be setting up a new body to help with the rebuild of the Canterbury capital.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m sure the Government is already considering a place for mana whenua and I will welcome that because I have every faith in Ngai Tahu to help make our city stronger. It makes sense to me to have Ngai Tahu there because they know what it takes to rebuild a community from the ground up and succeed.</p>
<p>&quot;They are also innovative thinkers, economically and culturally literate and the single biggest land owner in Canterbury and the South Island,&quot; Mrs Katene said.</p>
<p>&quot;Maori have a saying that &#39;with your basket of knowledge and our basket of knowledge, the people will prosper&#39; and I am sure that will happen for Christchurch as we see iwi, community, local and central government work together.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Katene said Ngai Tahu&#39;s immediate response to the February 22 earthquake was outstanding.</p>
<p>&quot;Their leadership of the Maori Recovery Network, a Ngai Tahu led collaboration between iwi and Maori organisations in both Otautahi and across Aotearoa, has been vital to the success of a coordinated response. One of the key achievements of the network, which includes the Maori wardens, has been to feed on-the-ground information about those in need to Government and non-government agencies.</p>
<p>&quot;In everything they do, they do it for their children and their children&#39;s children and this is the same aspiration most people in Christchurch share.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Katene said she will continue to advocate to the Government that Ngai Tahu be involved in the rebuilding work.<br>ends</p>
