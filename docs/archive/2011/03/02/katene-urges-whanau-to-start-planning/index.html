<p><strong>Rahui Katene<br>Maori Party MP for Te Tai Tonga (includes Christchurch)<br>2 March 2011</strong></p>
<h3>Katene urges whanau to start planning</h3>
<p>The local Māori MP for Christchurch Rāhui Katene says her office is becoming inundated with calls from people throughout the country wanting to help the people of Otautahi.</p>
<p>“We’re getting calls as far as Te Rerenga Wairua, through to Taranaki, the East Coast and many other places, particularly, in the North Island,” Mrs Katene said.</p>
<p>“A lot of people want to hop on a plane to Christchurch with gear to shovel the liquefaction, food to give to the needy and muscle power to lift aid, but the infrastructure here simply can’t support them all.</p>
<p>“As a result I am encouraging our people in the North Island and out of the Canterbury district to not only keep our whānau here in their prayers or to donate to the <a href="http://www.ngaitahu.iwi.nz/">earthquake charitable trust</a>, but to also start emergency planning among their own whānau, marae, iwi and communities.</p>
<p>“It is always best for our whānau, no matter where they live, to have an emergency plan. Being as best prepared as possible is our best defence.</p>
<p>“I also urge our people that once they have a plan for their whānau and marae, to then contact their <a href="http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/">local council</a> [which is responsible for civil defence at a local level] to see how they can help.</p>
<p>“There is a need for a strong Māori presence in Civil Defence because this is the group that has the resources, from portaloos to food, so our people need to link up directly with that.”</p>
<p>Mrs Katene said it was great to see most of the marae in Te Tau Ihu set up their own plans with Civil Defence either prior to or immediately after last year’s earthquake.</p>
