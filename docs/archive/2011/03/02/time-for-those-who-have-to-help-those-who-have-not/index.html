<p><strong>Tariana Turia and Dr Pita Sharples<br>Co-Leaders, Māori Party<br>2 March 2011</strong></p>
<h3>Māori Party: Time for those who ‘have’ to help those who ‘have not’</h3>
<p>The Maori Party is calling on the Government to ask New Zealanders with high incomes to support their more vulnerable friends and businesses as they cope with the aftermath of the Canterbury earthquakes and aftershocks.</p>
<p>“Now is the time for those who ‘have’ to help those who ‘have not,’” said Māori Party co-leader Tariana Turia. “We might call it manaakitanga – or good old fashioned ‘charity begins at home.’</p>
<p>“We are asking the Government to promote generosity by raising taxes for those on incomes over $70,000 to assist the Government to meet the crisis in Christchurch.</p>
<p>“All the forecasts tell us that growth for 2011 would be severely dented through production foregone in the wake of the earthquake,” said Māori Party co-leader Dr Pita Sharples.</p>
<p>“Business analysts also tell us that a high level of income inequality may also be detrimental to the level of social connectedness across society.</p>
<p>“We do not want to cause the very high proportion of families on low incomes who already feel the pressure of recent price increases any more stress through changes to policies such as Working for Families.</p>
<p>“Amongst our constituency in particular, low income Maori families are telling us that they are struggling to make ends meet on a daily basis. Let’s give them a break and rely on the benevolence of those with more to spare, to help their neighbours in need.”</p>
<p>Only 296,640 (8.7%) have incomes over $70,000 and so pay the top tax rate.</p>
