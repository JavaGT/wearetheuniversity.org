<p><strong>Myers Scholar to study languages at Cambridge</strong></p>
<p>William Coleman, head prefect at King’s College, Otahuhu last year, has been awarded the prestigious Sir Douglas Myers Scholarship for 2011 to Cambridge University in England.</p>
<p>The scholarship, worth $100,000 a year, will enable him to attend Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge. There he will take the Modern and Medieval Languages Tripos, studying French and Spanish along with politics and history.</p>
<p>Sir Douglas Myers, a Cambridge alumnus, set up the scholarship 11 years ago for academically gifted students intending to return to New Zealand to become leaders in their chosen fields.</p>
<p>In the Cambridge International AS Level examinations in 2009 William gained the highest mark in the world for French language and was top in New Zealand for history. Last year he took the prize for the top all-round male student at King’s College.</p>
<p>William, the youngest of five children, has always lived in Papakura At King’s he held numerous leadership positions in addition to head prefect: as a school tennis and debating captain, and as house captain of football, swimming, water polo, tennis, orienteering, debating, academics and music.</p>
<p>He was in the first eleven football team for four years, and had lead roles in senior drama and the Glee Club, gaining his full school cultural colours. He also received the King’s College Service Tie for his community work.</p>
<p>Having won a Leaders of Tomorrow Scholarship he is spending the first semester at the University of Otago taking French, Spanish and philosophy papers before starting at Cambridge in October.</p>

<p>“Studying at Cambridge has always been my dream,” says William. “In becoming a student there you make yourself a part of a history that extends back 800 years and includes some of the greatest minds this world has seen. I believe this history pushes the students at Cambridge to strive to greater heights.”</p>
<p>Cambridge also offers much in the sporting and cultural arenas, he says. “The college system is another aspect that greatly attracts me. Gonville and Caius is steeped in tradition and would provide an amazing environment of both stimulation and support.”</p>
<p>After completing his Cambridge course William hopes to take a postgraduate degree in politics and history followed by a PhD.</p>
<p>His long-term career goal is to be involved in diplomacy and international relations. “With the changing global economic and political climate, there will be huge potential for positioning New Zealand favourably on the international scene.”</p>
<p>Past Myers scholars are now working at a high level in such fields as manufacturing, management consulting and project management while others have advanced to doctoral study</p>
<p>Applications for the scholarships are handled by Universities New Zealand — Te Pokai Tara. The deadline for applications is 1 December. More information on the scholarship can be found at <a href="http://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz">www.universitiesnz.ac.nz</a></p>
