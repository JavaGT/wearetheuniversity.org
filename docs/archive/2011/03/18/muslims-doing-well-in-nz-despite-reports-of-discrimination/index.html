<h3>Muslims doing well in New Zealand despite reports of increased discrimination</h3>
<p>Despite an increase in reports of discrimination towards Muslims, a researcher at Victoria University says Muslims in this country are doing comparatively well in other measures.</p>
<p>The research project, conducted by final year PhD student Jaimee Stuart from Victoria’s Centre for Applied Cross-cultural Research, compared the experience of Muslim young people in New Zealand and the UK.</p>
<p>The study examined well-being, psychological symptoms, behavioural problems, discrimination and immigration stress in about 300 Muslim youth (aged 16-27 years) in both countries.</p>
<p>Ms Stuart says that the findings revealed that Muslim youth in this country demonstrate more positive outcomes on almost all indicators.</p>
<p>“Importantly, Muslims in New Zealand experience lower levels of discrimination and immigration stress, even though they have stronger religious identities and practice their religion more than those in the UK.”</p>
<p>The study also found that perceptions of living in an inclusive, multicultural society were higher for Muslims in New Zealand and that this was related to better outcomes.</p>
<p>“This may be an important indicator that social cohesion has direct and positive impacts on the adjustment of immigrants in New Zealand,” says Ms Stuart.</p>
