<p><strong>Friday, 4 March 2011, 9:58 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University">Massey University</a></strong></p>
<p>Massey offers options to quake-affected students</p>
<p>Massey University has extended its late enrolment deadline to accept students affected by the Canterbury earthquake until 5pm on March 14.</p>
<p>The University is offering a range of options to support students and the universities affected by the earthquake, including specialised support both from an academic and personal perspective, Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says.</p>
<p>“It is vital that the interests of students impacted by this tragic and devastating event are a priority,” Mr Maharey says. “They need to know that the New Zealand university system has the capacity to meet all their needs. It is also vital that the international community knows that New Zealand is fully able to provide a world-class university education.</p>
<p>“Like all New Zealand universities, Massey has worked closely in support of the efforts that have followed last week’s earthquake. We are providing support in the form of staff on the ground, expertise, fundraising and, now, we are offering specific additional options for affected students to ensure they are able to commence and complete their studies.”</p>
<p>Massey is uniquely positioned, with campuses at Albany in Auckland, Manawatu (Palmerston North) and Wellington and the distance-learning mode – the largest in the New Zealand university sector.</p>
<p>Students are advised that Lincoln and Canterbury Universities have said they intend to open and provide full programmes of study this year. Massey has encouraged students to follow the advice they receive from their current university. Where students want to come to Massey for an interim period, Massey has offered to provide students with emergency placements. Where students have made a fully informed decision to transfer their enrolment, Massey will consider their enrolment application under our late enrolment provisions.</p>
<p>Students may contact the university at any time on the free phone 0800-MASSEY (0800-627-739). Further information is available on the website <a href="http://www.massey.ac.nz/">http://www.massey.ac.nz/</a></p>
