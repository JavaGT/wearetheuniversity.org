<p>“Students already doing their fair share”</p>
<p>“Students in Canterbury and beyond will be relieved that putting interest back on student loans has been ruled out as a way for paying for the quake recovery in Christchurch”.</p>
<p>Lincoln University Students’ Association President, Ivy Harper has spoken out in support of the view taken by Prime Minister John Key to rule out putting interest on interest-free loans as a way of paying for quake damage in Christchurch.</p>
<p>“The appropriate response to the earthquake is a community response - not a response that places the burden on young people and the graduates of the future. Many students in Canterbury already face a number of challenges as a result of the quake - the anguish of having lost family and friends, relocation costs due to the damage of current rental properties, and the loss of income in addition to rising study costs. Students should not be targeted to shoulder this extra burden on their own”, says Ivy Harper.</p>
<p>Hundreds of students have been removing silt as a result of liquefaction from the streets of Christchurch every day. The Volunteer Student Army has been out in force every day since the earthquake. Buoyed by students from Lincoln University and large numbers of volunteers from the wider community, the ‘Student Army’ has played their part in the recovery.</p>
<p>“Our hearts are with the many families who have lost loved ones during this traumatic event. Lincoln University students have been out on their droves helping out the community anyway they can and have shown that they are willing to do their part in the face of this tragedy. It has been wonderful to see the response of the students many of whom just wanted to get out there and help”, adds Ivy Harper.</p>

<p>“Putting interest back on student loans will be a slap in the face for those students working hard in Canterbury and around the country to support the quake recovery. Putting more debt on them is hardly the fair thing to do”, contends Harper.</p>
<p>Interest-free is a very popular policy because it frees future generations from debt, reduces repayment times and increases access to education and the standard of living of all New Zealanders who stay in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders, including students, have shown that they are willing to do their part to come together and spread the burden of rebuilding Christchurch. I do not think New Zealanders are going to want to put that burden on future generations in the form of a massive debt which does not free up much money in the short-term at all really”, says Ivy Harper.</p>
