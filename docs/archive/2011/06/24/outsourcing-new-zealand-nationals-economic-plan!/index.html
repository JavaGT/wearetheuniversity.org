<h3>“Outsourcing New Zealand – National’s Economic Plan!”</h3>
<p>Today let us talk about the future and about hope.</p>
<p>The reason for these words – future – and hope – is because of a sad headline in the NZ Herald newspaper this week.</p>
<p>The headline read “Record Kiwi Exodus to Oz”.</p>
<p>Never did we dream that one day we would see droves of New Zealanders going overseas to seek a better life.</p>
<p>Admittedly the figures have been boosted by the Christchurch earthquakes but the really sad fact is that New Zealanders are losing their faith in the future of this country that was once known as “God&#39;s Own”.</p>
<p>And when faith in the future of a country is lost – hope fades. Hope that keeps a country alive.</p>
<p>If we look back over the centuries we see that hope brought humanity to New Zealand.</p>
<p>For hundreds of years intrepid travellers crossed storm tossed seas in leaky boats to reach this country and to make new homes.</p>
<p>Our history says that Maori travelled across the Pacific Ocean in giant canoes guided by the stars to reach a better land.</p>
<p>They were followed by the settlers from the British Isles – many of whom were escaping the poverty and degradation of Victorian England.</p>
<p>These people formed an alliance with the original settlers and went about building a new nation.</p>
<p>The alliance was a bit uneasy at times but there was a lot of goodwill and together these people put together a place that was known as “God&#39;s Own Country”.</p>

<p>Throughout our short history we have been blessed with many able leaders.</p>
<p>We have had men and women of great vision.</p>
<p>They set up communication systems, roads, railways, power stations, hospitals and centres of learning that equalled any in the world.</p>
<p>These people knew that New Zealand could not afford to remain a colony of Great Britain.</p>
<p>They knew that wealth is created through local ownership as well as hard work and ingenuity.</p>
<p>And unlike many of the upper crust back in the old country, these people of vision believed that the wealth created should be shared.</p>
<p>There was a belief that all citizens were entitled to food, shelter, healthcare and free education and that there should also be equal opportunity for everybody.</p>
<p>In this they never quite achieved nirvana but they got closer than any other people or nation.</p>
<p>During these decades the citizens of New Zealand had faith in their country and they held out great hope for their young people.</p>
<p>Sadly that has all changed. Look at what is happening.</p>
<p>Under recent collective economic genius we are exporting the lifeblood of our country – our people.</p>
<p>Now if you start looking at all the official figures about immigration you will hear all sorts of terms and explanations but the simple fact is that well over 400,000 people who were born in New Zealand are now living in Australia.</p>
<p>And that doesn’t include those who stopped for lunch on the way through.</p>
<p>In Australia there is a future for them and in Australia there is hope for them.</p>
<p>We might make jokes about Australians but Australia has clearly shown up the stupidity of New Zealand&#39;s policies over the past three decades.</p>
<p>Thousands of New Zealanders are voting with their feet.<br>They are being replaced by people from other places and many of them do not share the same values of tolerance and fair play that we grew up with.</p>
<p>It is simply a numbers game.</p>
<p>And speaking of numbers it&#39;s time to ask the government about where the 170,000 new jobs promised in the Budget are coming from.</p>
<p>That&#39;s right – 170,000 new jobs over the next four years.</p>
<p>It was simply part of the giant con job these people specialise in.</p>
<p>Since Budget day last month thousands of people have been given their marching orders, from railway shop workers to hundreds in our defence force announced just yesterday.</p>
<p>They have been thrown on the scrap heap of broken promises and failed policies.</p>
<p>This government will go down as one of the worst in the history of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Yet it will also go down as having the best public relations team.</p>
<p>When some serious problems arise they create maximum confusion on a number of fronts and then duck for cover.</p>
<p>The public smiley face of the government drops a few well thought out platitudes and then retreats behind a wall of minders, spin doctors, consultants and bloggers.</p>
<p>This gives the appearance of action and concern but the government is actually floundering; running the country on a week by week basis.</p>
<p>We have learned – direct from the horse&#39;s mouth how a lot of policy is made.</p>
<p>First a plan is leaked to certain compliant branches of the media.</p>
<p>Government ministers keep a respectful distance from it so they can adopt a position of what the Americans call “plausible deniability”.</p>
<p>The next step comes when teams of pollsters and focus groups test public reaction to the leaked idea.</p>
<p>If the policy meets the approval of a majority it gets announced.</p>
<p>If it is too hard for the public to swallow the policy gets dumped.</p>
<p>There is one major exception to this rule and that is the sale of taxpayer owned assets.</p>
<p>The vast majority of people do not want their assets sold and they particularly don’t want their assets sold to foreigners.<br>But this National led government is supported by big business and many foreign owned companies.</p>
<p>It is payola time for them.</p>
<p>And it is also payola time for the companies owned by the communist state of China.</p>
<p>The government started out by saying that shares in Air New Zealand and a number of our power stations would be made available to “Mum and Day” investors.</p>
<p>They conveniently forgot that Mum and Dad already own these assets – thanks to some farsighted leaders of yesteryear.</p>
<p>Now the government is gradually starting to admit that foreign ownership is more than a possibility.</p>
<p>It means that in less than two centuries New Zealand is doing a complete turnaround.</p>
<p>It has gone from being an economic colony of Great Britain, to prosperous nationhood, and is now going back to being an economic colony of China, Australia and other countries that are prepared to exploit us to the max.</p>
<p>You will all no doubt recall the great wisdom of the finance minister Bill English when he announced to the world recently that New Zealand is a great place for overseas investment because of the low wages that are paid here.</p>
<p>He said this before he went around Asia looking for buyers for our state assets like some shameless door to door panacea salesman.</p>
<p>What he was saying was come and buy our state assets and our farmland because we have our workers under control on low wages.</p>
<p>Make no mistake China is waiting to pounce.</p>
<p>The communist government already owns dairy processing plants and a number of other assets like major servicing companies to our farming industry.</p>
<p>They are waiting patiently until after the election to buy thousands of hectares of our dairy farmland.</p>
<p>Already – the Crafar farms are earmarked for overseas ownership and that ownership will lie with an investment company owned lock, stock and barrel by the communist government of China.</p>
<p>Now we want to make an important point here. We have no enmity with China even though we don’t agree with the way the place is run.</p>
<p>And it is true that the communist government has lifted the standard of living of many of its people.<br>But the people have no rights, they have no freedoms and many are enslaved to the growing industrial might of their country.</p>
<p>There are many ethnic Chinese in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Some families have been here since the gold rush days.</p>
<p>These people have been and still are loyal, law abiding, hardworking and trustworthy New Zealanders.</p>
<p>They have told me of their great concern about what is happening to their country. And their country is New Zealand.</p>
<p>They don’t want it sold overseas.</p>
<p>So, if the people of New Zealand dont want their airline and their power stations owned overseas, who is driving all this?</p>
<p>The answer is simple. It&#39;s the big business and foreign owned interests behind the National party.</p>
<p>These are the people who orchestrated the takeover of the Act party.</p>
<p>These are the people who want to get rid of the MMP electoral system.</p>
<p>These are the people with little foresight for the future of their country.</p>
<p>These are the people who would let outsiders pillage it.</p>
<p>These are the people who want to pay bread line wages to workers.</p>
<p>These are the people who are only interested in making vast sums of money and to hell with the rest of us.</p>
<p>If you are in any doubt about the motives of this government just look at the way they have handled changes to taxation.</p>
<p>We will use the boss of the Australian bank Westpac as a shining example.</p>
<p>He gets paid $5.6 million dollars a year.</p>
<p>The present government became worried about the level of his take home pay so they gave him a tax cut.</p>
<p>This tax cut amounted to just over $5,300 a week – that&#39;s true a tax CUT of more than $5,000 a week.</p>
<p>The government had to pay for these tax cuts to the rich so they increased the level of GST from 12.5 percent to 15 percent.</p>
<p>To help workers through these hard times, this government lifted the minimum wage by 25 cents an hour to $13 an hour.</p>
<p>That means an extra $10 a week. Big deal!</p>
<p>The Australian bank boss, whose job it is to extract maximum profits from New Zealanders gets an extra $5,300 a week.</p>
<p>A New Zealander on the minimum wage got an extra ten dollars.</p>
<p>Is that fair?</p>
<p>And we&#39;ll tell you something else that is not fair.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not often that we spring to the defence of the media but we learned this week that Fairfax media are laying off more staff.</p>
<p>Australian based Fairfax media own newspapers such as the Dominion Post and The Press. These papers were of course, once owned by New Zealanders.</p>
<p>They have previously laid off journalists and editorial staff and now they are taking the axe to advertising staff.</p>
<p>Forty five jobs are going and they are going to India.</p>
<p>There is a term for this and it is called “outsourcing”.</p>
<p>So the whole thing works like this:</p>
<p>A foreign company buys a New Zealand firm.</p>
<p>It does not want to pay New Zealand wages – low as they are – so it lays off the Kiwi workers and sends their jobs to a country where the pay is even lower.</p>
<p>Eventually the NZ firm gets closed down and all the work gets sent overseas.</p>
<p>The present government is resigned to this situation.</p>
<p>It is called globalisation and free trade and everybody is supposed to benefit from it.</p>
<p>The real beneficiaries are the money and paper shufflers that live in glass towers gazing intently into computer screens.</p>
<p>They are called “the market” and apparently market forces are very good for all of us.</p>
<p>These free marketeers, free traders and globalisers are the worst leeches the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>In recent years they brought many Western democracies to the edge of ruin.<br>They have no ethics and no feeling for suffering humanity and no loyalty to their countries. Their greed is unsustainable and knows no bounds.</p>
<p>These are the people behind this government.</p>
<p>And this government in turn has shown very little loyalty to New Zealanders.</p>
<p>The great poet Sir Walter Scott wrote these great lines about patriotism.</p>
<p>“Breathes there a man with soul so dead<br>Who never to himself has said<br>This is my own my native land...”</p>
<p>Sadly New Zealanders elected a government that does not truly care about the country it governs.</p>
<p>It sees New Zealand as one big opportunity for a bargain sale.</p>
<p>We, a once proud people are being ignored and cast on the scrap heap as the jobs we are so good at are gradually but surely out-sourced around the world.</p>
<p>Our wealth is in our land, our strength is in our own people, and a government that cannot see that is guilty of treason.</p>
<p>Our jobs are being taken away, our environment is being trashed, our fisheries are under further threat, and our people are fleeing in droves.</p>
<p>Our ancestors fled the kind of economic tyranny now being contemplated, so we their descendants would have a better life.</p>
<p>And so the question for all of us.</p>
<p>Will we let these politicians take that away from our children and grandchildren?</p>
<p>You have an answer to these questions.</p>
<p>We respectfully suggest that answer is New Zealand First.</p>
<p>We are New Zealanders who believe in our country and in our people.</p>
<p>The name of our party means what it says. And it says New Zealand First – and New Zealanders First!</p>
<p>This will be a watershed election. Once our public assets and farmland have been sold there will be little future here. There will be little hope.</p>
<p>But there is still a chance to save it - with New Zealand First. We urge you to grab your chance with both hands on Election Day.</p>
<p>We won’t let you down.</p>
