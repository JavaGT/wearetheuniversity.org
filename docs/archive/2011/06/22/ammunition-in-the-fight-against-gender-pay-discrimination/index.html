<p><strong>Welcome ammunition in the fight against gender pay discrimination</strong></p>
<p>The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa is welcoming proposed changes to the Equal Pay Act, saying it will give thousands of low paid women some welcome ammunition in the fight for pay and employment equity.</p>
<p>The Green Party MP Catherine Delahunty has released a Member’s Bill to amend the Equal Pay Act. It will ensure women have access to information about pay rates in their workplace to test if there is gender-based discrimination.</p>
<p>NZEI says gender pay discrimination affects thousands of low paid education workers.</p>
<p>“It’s something school support staff know only too well,” says NZEI National Secretary Paul Goulter.</p>
<p>An independent job evaluation report showed that when compared with male dominated jobs of corrections officers and cleaners, school support staff such as teacher aides and administrators were paid as much as $8 an hour less.</p>
<p>Other pay and employment equity investigations in education have also shown areas where women employees are not being treated fairly or are being discriminated against in terms of pay, career advancement and the value of their work.</p>
<p>Paul Goulter says “unfortunately the government continues to systematically ignore the evidence and has shut down all moves aimed a closing the gender pay gap.”</p>
<p>“It is good to see someone moving forward on the issue. Giving women access to gender pay details in their workplaces will make it hard for the government and employers to ignore the fact that the gender pay gap is alive and well and that thousands of women are being denied the pay and opportunities they deserve.”</p>
