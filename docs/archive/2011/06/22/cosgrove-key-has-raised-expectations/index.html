<p><strong>Cosgrove: Key has raised expectations</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister John Key has raised expectations that tomorrow’s earthquake announcements in Christchurch will enable people to start planning their futures with far greater certainty, says Labour’s Canterbury Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow’s announcement has been a badly-kept secret, but whatever the political manoeuvring that’s being going on behind the scenes, it’s still welcome that John Key is going to give people a far better idea what’s going to happen in terms of their own properties, their streets and their suburbs,” Clayton Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“”Information is currency. People will be grateful to be told anything that allows them to start thinking positively about what their future holds.</p>
<p>“It is still not clear just what level of detail will be provided tomorrow --- whether there will be more grey than black and white --- but it can be presumed that John Key wouldn’t finally be fronting up without a plan to announce.</p>
<p>“People are expecting definitive information. They don’t want John Key just flying in and flying out before he goes off to India.”</p>
<p>Clayton Cosgrove said Labour was reserving its judgment until it learned details of tomorrow’s announcement.</p>
<p>“It is encouraging that some people who are most vulnerable are receiving telephone calls in advance, but we are worried that what will result is that one person gets a call and their neighbour doesn’t. That’s happened previously This causes some people to feel left out and worried they might have dropped off the list somehow.</p>
<p>“John Key made the commitment after the September quake that no one in Canterbury would be left worse off. Tomorrow will be another acid test of that commitment.”</p>
