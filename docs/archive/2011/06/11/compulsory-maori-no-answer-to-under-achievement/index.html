<p><strong>Compulsory Maori No Answer To Under-Achievement</strong></p>
<p>Proposals to make tertiary level Maori language and education courses compulsory for secondary school teachers are racist, high-handed and wrong-headed, says ACT New Zealand Leader Dr Don Brash.</p>
<p>The proposals are part of a Maori Youth Council report on ways to counter Maori under-achievement. Associate Education Minister Pita Sharples pronounces himself &quot;excited&quot; by them and intent on phasing them in.</p>
<p>&quot;Just who gave him a mandate to do that?&quot; asks Dr Brash.</p>
<p>&quot;Under-achievement is not an exclusively Maori problem requiring an exclusively Maori solution. One of its root causes is lack of competence in <em>English</em> and other basics among teachers. As recently as February this year, the Secondary Principals&#39; Association was lamenting that &#39;some teachers are so lacking in literacy and numeracy skills that they cannot write adequate reports or do primary-school-level maths.&#39;<br>&quot;I quote from an article in the <em>Dominion Post</em> at the time:</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence from principals included teachers being unable to write reports, having poor reading comprehension, making basic punctuation, grammar and spelling errors, and being unable to help pupils&#39; reading. Some teachers had difficulty completing basic multiplication, division, algebra and problem-solving, including inability to do basic calculations without the assistance of a calculator, and the inability to solve basic mathematical problems which we would expect pupils in primary school to be able to solve.</p>

<p>&quot;Small wonder one pupil in four is leaving school functionally illiterate,&quot; Dr Brash continues.</p>
<p>&quot;These are the deficiencies we ought to be addressing. Foisting Maori on teachers, far from being helpful, will be a further distraction from lifting them to an acceptable degree of competence. It will also, as Maori broadcaster Scotty Morrison has already observed, foster resentment.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT has no problem with teachers voluntarily learning <em>Te Reo</em> if they wish. But treating it as a panacea that ought to be made compulsory at taxpayer expense is beyond mischievous. The fact that this morning&#39;s online <em>New Zealand Herald</em> poll shows 90% of respondents opposed to the idea indicates clearly and reassuringly that most New Zealanders can see through it.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT will fight it tooth and nail,&quot; Dr Brash concludes.<br>ENDS</p>
