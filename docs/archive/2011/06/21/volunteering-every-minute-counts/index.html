<p><strong>Volunteering – Every Minute Counts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tuesday 21 June 2011</strong></p>
<p>I read a sign the other day that said “<em>if opportunity doesn’t knock for you build a door’</em>. It was a concept that reminded me of the amazing efforts so many New Zealanders go to, in keeping the heartbeat of our communities pumping. We call these people whanau; we call them friends; we call them carers; we call them volunteers.</p>
<p>This week is <strong>Volunteer Awareness Week</strong> (19-25 June) in which we acknowledge the vital contribution volunteers make in our communities – from maintaining our marae and training our sports teams, delivering meals on wheels, running the toy library, through to mentoring at the local Computer Clubhouse, patrolling our streets as a Māori warden, supporting victims of family violence, or being part of a circle of support for a person with a disability in their community.</p>
<p>A 2008 study found that volunteers make up 67% of the New Zealand non-profit workforce – a higher proportion than in forty other countries studied.</p>
<p>This year the theme of Volunteer Awareness Week is “Every minute counts”. A minute is all it takes to knock on a door and say, can I help? A minute is all it takes to pick up the phone, and say what would you like me to do?</p>
<p>Volunteering – in whatever culture, whatever community, is all about being there, in the here and now, helping someone to read, teaching a skill, extending our responsibilities out to caring for another. It’s about being prepared to trust in others, to look out for our neighbours, to fulfil an act of service.</p>

<p>I’m really proud to announce that at the same time as we are celebrating Volunteer Awareness Week New Zealand is being represented by a young man from my electorate, Anthony Wanakore. Anthony, from Taumarunui, was selected as the UNICEF ambassador for New Zealand, and is now in Solo, Central Java (Indonesia) attending the second Asia Pacific Conference on Child-Friendly Cities. Over 500 local and international participants will be at the Summit. It’s such an inspired concept – how would our cities look if designed by our children? Congratulations Anthony – we are all so proud of you and I can’t wait to hear about your experience on your return.</p>
<p>Whether you are an international ambassador or helping our senior citizens with their gardens, volunteering is about walking in the footsteps of another and expressing the mutual respect that comes with developing a relationship. The wonderful gift we receive in return, is that contributing to the wellbeing of someone else, contributes to your own wellbeing.</p>
<p>In this tenth anniversary of International Year of Volunteers 2001, we have seen the power of volunteering shine through in the responses to the continuing Canterbury earthquakes - neighbours and community groups have helped each other in one of the biggest volunteer efforts we have ever seen. Our next big voluntary event will be the Rugby World Cup and all the festivities around the Cup that will draw on the talents of our arts and culture volunteers, our volunteer coordinators as well as those interested in sports.</p>
<p>Let’s take the opportunity this week to say a heart felt “thank you” to people we know who volunteer and the organisations they work with. Thank you for your enthusiasm, your will to make a positive contribution to someone else’s life and the innovation that creates opportunities when the need arises.</p>
<p>ENDS  </p>
