<p><strong>Seminar on Human-Induced Climate Change</strong></p>
<p>June 21, 2011 - Dr Vaishali Naik, a Scientist with the Atmospheric Physics, Chemistry and Climate Group from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) in Princeton, New Jersey recently presented a seminar on ‘Interactions between Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate: An Overview’ at the University of the South Pacific’s Marine Campus in Suva.</p>
<p>The seminar, which was jointly organised by the School of Biological and Chemical Sciences at USP and the Chemical Society of the South Pacific (CSSP), was held on 9 June 2011.</p>
<p>In her presentation to the staff and students of the University, Dr Naik presented an overview of the current understanding of interactions between chemistry and climate.</p>
<p>“Natural and human activities release short-lived gases and aerosol particles that affect the radioactive balance of the Earth directly or indirectly,” she said.</p>
<p>She elaborated that human-induced climate forcing occurs via chemically active species in the Earth’s atmosphere. The most important of these species is the tropospheric ozone as the ozone is a greenhouse gas that absorbs outgoing infrared radiation and warms the surface of the Earth.</p>
<p>Dr Naik highlighted the key chemistry-climate and atmosphere-biosphere interactions in the earth’s atmosphere and their role in climate change impact assessment through new and innovative approaches to global earth system modeling.</p>
<p>She explained that the radioactive impact of aerosol particles is more complex and depends on their chemical composition. She added that aerosols can impact climate by modifying cloud properties.</p>

<p>She told participants that changes in climate can alter the spatial and temporal distribution of these short-lived species in the atmosphere by both changing emissions and changing the chemical processes occurring in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>According to Dr Naik, major uncertainties exist in the estimates of the overall climate impact of chemically active species and their evolution in the future.</p>
