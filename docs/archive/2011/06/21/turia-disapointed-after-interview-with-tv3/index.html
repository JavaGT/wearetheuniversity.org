<p><strong>Tuesday, 21 June 2011, 9:37 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party">The Maori Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Maori Party co-leader Tariana Turia, is disappointed that an extended interview with TV3 has once again confirmed her view that honesty and integrity are not characteristics that the media are comfortable with portraying.</p>
<p>&quot;When you are interviewed for twenty minutes one would expect the interview to reflect the totality of what was said&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;I did admit to TV political editor, Duncan Garner, the obvious - that Solomon Tipene was new to politics and that that has been hard for him&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;But there are a thousand different interpretations we could make of that one statement&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We could interpret it as &#39;a fresh new face&#39;; a character untainted by the often corrosive environment of the Beehive&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We could interpret it as being someone prepared to face a challenge, and the courage and determination that comes with it&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;If you&#39;re a reporter you interpret it as &#39;throwing in the towel&#39; and if you&#39;re a political opponent you call it &#39;an insult to the North&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;As for Hone supposedly feeling that the Maori Party had &#39;trashed&#39; him - I absolutely refute such rubbish&quot;.</p>
<p>“I also told Duncan that Solomon was a good man, and that I fully supported him but that doesn’t appear to have the same appeal as a sound-bite”.</p>
<p>&quot;In my heart of hearts, I know that the people of the North are calling for an honest, hard-working, trustworthy person – and they have found that in Solomon Tipene&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I fully endorse the comment on Native Affairs tonight that Solomon Tipene should be respected for his dignity - but he should also be respected for his capability, and his ability to so quickly learn the ropes of what I am once again reminded tonight, is the brutal profession of politics&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Finally, as for the aspersions cast around the Matariki event - I told Duncan that my family have challenged me that I must still continue to uphold our whanau special occasions despite the pressures of a political life. Matariki (the Maori New Year) is the one day every year that our Nga Waiariki/Ngati Apa whanau join together for celebration - and it is one day in the year that I really believe I must respect as whanau time.</p>
