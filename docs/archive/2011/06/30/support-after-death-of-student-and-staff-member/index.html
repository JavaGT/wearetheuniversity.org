<p>Support after death of student and staff member</p>
<p>Massey University staff and students extend sincere condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of student and staff member Venessa Green, 40, who died in hospital last night after being hit by a bus while jogging in Willis St, Wellington.</p>
<p>Ms Green was taken to Wellington Hospital by ambulance with injuries described as critical after being struck just after 1pm on Tuesday. She was well known and highly respected at the University&#39;s Wellington campus, where she was on the verge of completing her thesis for a Master of Health Science (Sport and Exercise) degree. She was also employed as an administrator in the College of Humanities and Social Sciences and as a pilates instructor in the campus recreation centre. Originally from Christchurch, she enrolled at Massey in 2008 and had earlier studied as a distance student. She also had a Bachelor of Physical Education and a Bachelor of Science in psychology from the University of Otago.</p>
<p>The University arranged transport and other support for Ms Green&#39;s family and friends, who arrived from Christchurch and Australia yesterday. Wellington campus registrar Deanna Riach says support, including professional counselling services, is available on campus for any students or staff.</p>
<p>Massey Wellington Students&#39; Association president Alex Hema expressed sympathy on behalf of all association members to Venessa&#39;s family and friends. &quot;Our hearts go out to them,&quot; Ms Hema said. &quot;At a time of such sadness I urge any students impacted by this tragic accident to avail themselves of the support the university is offering. Don’t suffer alone. Massey University has everything in place to help you – please take advantage of it.&quot;</p>
