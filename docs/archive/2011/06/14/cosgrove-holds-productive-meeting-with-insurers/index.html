<p>14 June 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Cosgrove holds productive meeting with insurers</strong></p>
<p>Labour’s Canterbury Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove has held what he calls a ‘productive’ meeting with the Insurance Council and representatives of AMI and IAG on concerns Christchurch residents have at signing off their insurance claims.</p>
<p>Clayton Cosgrove said he called the meeting in Wellington after the Government’s refusal to provide Canterbury earthquake victims with access to independent legal advice.</p>
<p>“I am increasingly concerned that the understandable reluctance of residents to sign off on claims is slowing the recovery and adding to the stress of people who are already under enormous pressure. I wrote to Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee months ago asking him to provide access to independent advice, but he has stubbornly shown no interest.</p>
<p>“Today’s meeting was productive and helpful,” Clayton Cosgrove said. “The proof will be in the pudding, but both AMI and IAG have agreed to re-visit specific clauses in their individual contracts to see whether they can be justified. We will be very interested in analysing the outcome of this.</p>
<p>“They have also agreed that if they decided their contracts should be worded differently that they will go back to clients who have signed and offer them a new document.</p>

<p>“The Insurance Council has also agreed to contact other insurers to see if they can find potential issues in their contracts as well,” Clayton Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“I was pleased with the response today. The last thing we want is for claimants to lose trust in insurance companies. That will just slow the recovery process down.</p>
<p>“I accept that the so-called one-page contracts companies have been offering claimants were designed to streamline and speed up the process. The motivation is good, but we just have to ensure that stressed people are not disadvantaged.</p>
<p>“This situation would not have eventuated if Gerry Brownlee had heeded the call for independent advice six months ago,” Clayton Cosgrove said.</p>
