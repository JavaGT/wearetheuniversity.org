<p><strong>Collins Comments June 20</strong></p>
<p>It’s always a privilege to meet with our district’s young people when I’m back in the electorate.</p>
<p>This week I was fortunate enough to visit <strong>The Gardens Childcare Centre</strong> on Hill Road - it was wonderful to see the great work that Micha Brown and her staff are doing with our children.</p>
<p>This Government is committed to providing all early childhood students with equal opportunity to succeed.</p>
<p>I’m delighted to say we’re investing <strong>$9.5 million</strong> to build eight new early childhood education services in South and East Auckland – including $1 million to establish a new Maori bilingual centre with fifty child places in <strong>Randwick Park</strong>, Manurewa.</p>
<p>This is great news for our electorate. The new centre will give some of our district’s most vulnerable children the benefits of a quality early childhood education before they start school.</p>
<p>I enjoyed visiting pupils in Rooms 9 and 27 at <strong>Randwick Park School</strong> recently as they settled into their classrooms in the school’s new learning facility. I was particularly impressed by the students’ creativity in writing and producing their very own community radio station – well done to you all!</p>
<p>I also enjoyed speaking to students at <strong>Rosehill Intermediate School</strong> about the benefits of long-term goal setting. Encouraging our students to persevere with their goals is key to helping them achieve academic, cultural and sporting success.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to acknowledge our district&#39;s talented teaching and support staff - especially those who welcomed me this week - as they continue to inspire and educate our children.</p>
<p>Our electorate is home to some fantastic young people and I look forward to following their future successes.</p>
<p>**Hon Judith Collins<br>**MP for Papakura</p>
