<p><strong>Volunteer Awareness Week (19-25 June)</strong></p>
<p><strong>20 June 2011 Media Statement</strong></p>
<p>It’s time to celebrate the volunteers in our communities. Throughout Maungakiekie committed people are giving their time to generously help others.</p>
<p>During Volunteer Awareness Week (19-25) June, we acknowledge the vital contribution volunteers make in a myriad of ways – through sport, art and culture, conservation, health, social services, police and education”, says Maungakiekie MP, Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.</p>
<p>In this tenth anniversary of International Year of Volunteers 2001, we have seen the power of volunteering through the response to the Canterbury earthquake. Neighbours and a wide range of organisations pitched into help each other in what was one of the biggest volunteer efforts we have seen. Also this year, the Rugby World Cup is a huge event that will rely on over 5,000 volunteers.</p>
<p>“Volunteering is part of the Kiwi way of life. Let’s take the opportunity this week to say a heartfelt “thank you” to people we know who volunteer and the organisations they work with”, says Mr Lotu-Iiga.</p>
<p>A 2008 Study found that volunteers make up 67% of the New Zealand non-profit workforce – a higher proportion than in 40 other countries studied. More recently, data has found that around 30% of people volunteer a median of 10 hours per month.</p>
<p>“Volunteering is part of the Kiwi way of life. Let’s take the opportunity this week to say a heartfelt “thank you” to people we know who volunteer and the organisations they work with”, says Mr Lotu-Iiga.</p>
