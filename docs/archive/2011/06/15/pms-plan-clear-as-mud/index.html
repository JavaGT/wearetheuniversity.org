<p>PM’s plan clear as mud</p>
<p>John Key said yesterday his Government had a ‘clear picture’ of the suburbs which will need to be abandoned in Christchurch, but his refusal to share this information is adding to the stress and anguish people are experiencing, says Labour MP for Christchurch East Lianne Dalziel.</p>
<p>“John Key says he understands circumstances are frustrating but that he wants to ‘get it right’ as ‘it is not only the land but what happens next’ which lies in the balance.</p>
<p>“While the sentiment is valid, he entirely misses the point,” Lianne Dalziel said.</p>
<p>“What happens with the land next is very much secondary to the facts as they stand. If the picture is as clear as he is making out, residents have the right to know,” Lianne Dalziel said.</p>
<p>“John Key obviously isn’t aware of the impact this uncertainty is having on residents of the affected suburbs.</p>
<p>“In the worst affected suburbs people have been on tenterhooks since September, and while we now know that the remediation plans agreed to then are no longer possible as a result of the February earthquake, there must be an end in sight.</p>
<p>“We need to know what has happened to the land and what engineered solutions are possible, before navigating the economics of any proposals. John Key is clearly indicating that the Government knows the answer to these questions, but is not prepared to tell those who are affected nor indicate a timeline.</p>
<p>“Key’s refusal to honestly engage with us is delaying the process of recovery. Giving an indication of the future of individual suburbs will allow people to move on psychologically even if they cannot yet move on physically.</p>

<p>“Withholding this information while the compensation package is sorted out may have been an option, but now John Key has announced thousands will have to leave their homes it is apparent the Government has a fair idea of who will be affected.</p>
<p>“Yesterday’s visit and comments by John Key have added yet another unnecessary layer of uncertainty. People deserve access to the information that dictates their futures. It’s a matter of respect,” Lianne Dalziel said.  </p>
