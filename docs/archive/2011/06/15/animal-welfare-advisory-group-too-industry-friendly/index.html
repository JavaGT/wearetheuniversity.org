<h3>Animal welfare advisory group too industry friendly</h3>
<p>The newly announced Advisory Group on Animal Welfare is industry friendly, rather than animal friendly, Green Party animal welfare spokesperson Sue Kedgley said today.</p>
<p>The Minister of Agriculture has set up an advisory group to oversee the development of a national animal welfare strategy, to feed into a review of the Animal Welfare Act. (Note: The full list of advisory group members is included at the bottom of this release).</p>
<p>“Why are representatives from an animal slaughter house, and from Fonterra, about to shape the future of animal welfare for New Zealand,” asked Ms Kedgley.</p>
<p>“I have to question the purpose of the review, given many representatives appear to have a background of advocating against animal welfare solutions.</p>
<p>“I am also concerned that Dr John Hellstrom, Chair of the Animal Welfare Advisory Committee, is a member of the advisory group, given his recent statements on radio that he believes hens in colony cages are happy and content.</p>
<p>“If the Minister was serious about reviewing the Animal Welfare Act with a view to improving conditions for animals in New Zealand, he should have ensured that people with a proven track in advocating for animals are on the Animal Welfare Advisory Group.”</p>
