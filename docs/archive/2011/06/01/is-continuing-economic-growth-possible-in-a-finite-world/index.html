<h3>How do you balance economic growth with the needs of the planet?</h3>
<p>Economic growth has long been a key objective of most governments-but is continuing growth possible in a finite world?</p>
<p>That critical question will be debated by experts from science, business, economics and the Government at a symposium hosted by Victoria University&#39;s Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) next week.</p>
<p>Professor Jonathan Boston of the IPS says the symposium will explore the growing evidence of the planet&#39;s biophysical limits and consider the policy implications arising from this.</p>
<p>For the last four decades, there has been a lively debate about the extent to which there are planetary limits to economic growth, or at least growth of certain kinds, he says.</p>
<p>This debate has been invigorated in recent years, not least as a result of concerns over human-induced climate change, the poor management of the globe&#39;s freshwater and marine resources, the loss of agricultural land and population growth.</p>
<p>Professor Boston says our growing awareness of the earth&#39;s biophysical limits have significant implications that need to be addressed by governments.</p>
<p>The symposium will draw on experts from a range of disciplines and jurisdictions to tackle questions such as: Which kinds of critical natural capital are substitutable? How do you set safe&#39; biophysical boundaries, and what are the risks of overshooting such boundaries?</p>
<p>Symposium speakers include the Prime Minister&#39;s Chief Science Advisor Professor Sir Peter Gluckman; Minister of the Environment Hon Dr Nick Smith; Principal Scientist in Sustainability and Society at Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research Dr Bob Frame; economist Dr Steve Hatfield-Dodds and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Research Fellow Dr Brian Walker.</p>
