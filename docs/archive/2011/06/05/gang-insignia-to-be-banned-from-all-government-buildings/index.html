<p><strong>Sunday, 5 June 2011, 11:34 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Gang Insignia to be banned from All Government Buildings in New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>National MP Todd McClay is to introduce a Members Bill to Parliament banning Gang Insignia from all government buildings in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;Wearing gang insignia in a Work and Income NZ or Housing NZ office, on the grounds of a public school or hospital will become a criminal offense&quot; said Mr McClay, MP for Rotorua.</p>
<p>Mr McClay said that gangs serve no legitimate purpose in NZ society. They run much of the drug trade and are involved with organised crime. Intimidating behaviour by gangs will not be tolerated, he said</p>
<p>“Everyday members of the public seek assistance from government departments. Law abiding citizens deserve to be protected from intimidation and threat when they visit government buildings. When people work for the government they have the right to be protected from the harm that gangs do,” he said.</p>
<p>&quot;My message to gangs in this bill is clear. If you walk into a Work and Income office wearing a patch, the government will not serve you. Instead, a policeman will arrest you.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr McClay said that the National Government had passed a raft of legislation to target gang activity. This Bill is another step towards toughening up on gangs and sends a clear message to gang members whose purpose is to inflict misery and harm to individuals and communities.</p>
<p>Mr McClay said that his bill was modelled on the Wanganui Gang Insignia Act passed by Parliament in 2009 when Michael Laws was Mayor of Wanganui.</p>

<p>Any gang member who wears gang insignia in a government building will face a fine of up to $2000 with the insignia destroyed</p>
<p>“Gang members wear their insignia as a badge of pride. It gives them arrogance to intimidate law abiding members of the public. Patches identify the wearer as a member of a criminal organization who has most likely committed crimes to earn the right to display a gang patch. This is appalling and there is no place for it in Work and Income NZ, Housing NZ offices, or any other government building in this country,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr McClay said “For those who are concerned about civil liberty I will always put the needs of victims and government employees before the rights of gangs whose sole purpose seems to be to harm others, commit crimes and manufacture and sell drugs to our children.”</p>
<p>Editors Note:</p>
<p>Housing New Zealand Residential houses and Department of Conservation land will be exempt from the Bill. The grounds of public schools, ECE centres and DHBs will be included.</p>
