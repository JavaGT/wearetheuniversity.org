<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong><br><strong>DATE</strong> June 16 2011</p>
<p><strong>FROM</strong> Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association</p>
<p><strong>Feeding frenzy for students</strong></p>
<p>The Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) last week fed over 1900 students across all the University’s campuses.</p>
<p>VUWSA’s end of trimester ‘Stress-Free Study Week’ aims to help students make the most of their study period, and make life a little bit easier while they prepare for exams. VUWSA delivered over 1900 free breakfasts at Kelburn, Pipitea and Te Aro campuses, and free lunches at the Karori campus.</p>
<p>Students were treated to a simple, but delicious breakfast that included options not usually found in a typical student flat.</p>
<p>For the first time specially made ‘Exam Packs&#39; containing juice, dried fruit, nuts and lollies were delivered to students studying at the library late in the evening.</p>
<p>VUWSA President Seamus Brady said that the response we got from students was phenomenal.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw an increase in demand each day at all campuses&quot; said Mr Brady. &quot;At Te Aro campus in particular, we experienced a significantly higher turnout of students attending than we have in previous years.</p>
<p>“Initiatives like this are a huge task for the VUWSA and our brilliant volunteers, but are incredibly important with the cost of living increasing, average student incomes decreasing, and fewer students being able to find work while they face record high student fees.”</p>
<p>VUWSA will be returning with the next ‘Stress-Free Study Week’ from 17 – 21 October.</p>
