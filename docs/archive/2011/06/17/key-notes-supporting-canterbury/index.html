<p>Key Notes: Supporting Canterbury</p>
<p><strong>17 June 2011</strong><br><strong>SUPPORTING CANTERBURY</strong><br>Life is tough for many Cantabrians at the moment. Monday&#39;s aftershocks are another blow for the city and its people, who have already been through so much. But this doesn&#39;t change the Government&#39;s long-term commitment to the region, which includes $5.5 billion over six years to help with rebuilding.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I visited Christchurch to show the Government&#39;s support and to catch up with those involved in the earthquake response.</p>
<p>I know the biggest concern for many homeowners is property and land damage. Unfortunately there are some areas we won&#39;t be able to rebuild in. The Government is working towards the next steps for residents in those areas.</p>
<p>The Government has said all along it wants homeowners with insurance to regain as much equity as possible, and we&#39;re working hard to achieve that. We know it&#39;s frustrating and patience is wearing thin, but this is a huge and complex task, which will take some time. We hope to be able to provide certainty for homeowners soon.</p>
<p>All New Zealanders are thinking of you at this very difficult time, and we will continue to support you. I encourage those who have damaged homes to make use of support available - such as our <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16070.link">temporary accommodation assistance package</a>.</p>

<p><strong>VISITING AUSTRALIA</strong></p>
<p>On Sunday I&#39;m leaving for a <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16072.link">two-day visit to Australia</a>.</p>
<p>In Canberra I&#39;ll be addressing the Australian Parliament. It&#39;ll be the first time a New Zealand Prime Minister has done this. I&#39;m looking forward to reinforcing our strong trans-Tasman ties in my address.</p>
<p>While in Canberra, I also have a number of meetings, including with Governor-General Her Excellency Quentin Bryce, Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Cabinet Ministers, and the Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott.</p>
<p>The trip concludes with a quick visit to Sydney. I&#39;ll be going to a special fundraising dinner for the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal, which has been generously organised by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.</p>
<p><strong>SHOWCASING OUR PRIMARY SECTOR</strong></p>
<p>On Wednesday I had a great day chatting to people at Fieldays in Mystery Creek. This is a huge annual event, which I always really enjoy going to. It&#39;s a chance to celebrate our rural communities and our primary industries.</p>

<p><strong>BOOSTING TRADE WITH INDIA</strong></p>
<p>Next week <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16075.link">I&#39;m going to India with Trade Minister Tim Groser</a> and a 25-strong business delegation. Our visit is about building stronger ties between New Zealand and India, and boosting two-way trade.</p>
<p>India is a rapidly rising player in the Asia-Pacific region, and we want to make the most of the opportunities it provides. Boosting trade will help our businesses grow, create jobs, and raise wages.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll meet India&#39;s Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to talk about issues including the New Zealand-India Free Trade Agreement negotiations.</p>
<p><strong>FROM MY DIARY</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;m looking forward to officially opening Queenstown Winter Festival next Friday, before heading to India on Sunday.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p><strong>John Key<br>Prime Minister</strong>  </p>
