<p><strong>Friday, 3 June 2011, 6:59 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Otago University Students&#39; Association - Presidential By-Election and Referendum result</strong><br>**<br>For immediate release<br>**<br>Voting for the Otago University Students’ Association’s Presidential By-Election and Referendum has officially closed, and we can announce our newest President, Logan Edgar, who will lead the Student Executive for the remainder of 2011.</p>
<p>OUSA received one of its highest voter turnouts for both, with the referendum peaking at 2644, and 2584 votes in the Presidential by-election.</p>
<p>Final numbers for the by-election were were:<br>Shonelle Eastwood 292<br>Bradley Russell 423<br>Francisco Hernandez 525<br>Logan Edgar 1265<br>No confidence 61<br>Abstain 18</p>
<p>Logan Edgar, 19, studying Marketing at the University of Otago had this to say about his new position, “Everyday I’m in office I’m going to work as hard as I can for OUSA. Thanks very much to all of my voters and supporters, especially my close group of friends for campaigning for me over the last two weeks.”</p>
<p>“We’re really glad with the turnout and we hope to get more students involved and voting in the second semester when we elect a President for 2012.” Said Imogen Roth, Returning Officer for OUSA.</p>
<p>Run alongside the by-election, the referendum sought to ask the student members their position on a number of questions that would initiate action from OUSA. While it failed to secure a new constitution, all other questions were passed.</p>

<p>Members chose to oppose factory farming and OUSA will now look into lobbying the University’s food outlets to supply only free range eggs, chicken and pig products.</p>
<p>OUSA will also work to be reinstated onto the University Disciplinary board, which decides the fate of students facing disciplinary action, and possible exclusion from studying at the University of Otago.</p>
<p>Members also chose to oppose moves by the government in the 2011 Government Budget, which restrict or reduce financial support to students and access to interest free student loans.</p>
<p>OUSA wishes to thank its members, the students of Otago University, for participating in the voting period, and also wishes to congratulate all candidates for running!</p>
