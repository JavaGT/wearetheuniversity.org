<p><strong>Deadline for “School is Cool” competition extended</strong></p>
<p>Due to popular demand and a request from principals, the deadline for Education Aotearoa’s School Is Cool competition has been extended two weeks until July 15.</p>
<p>Believed to be one of New Zealand’s largest on-line art competitions, School Is Cool is open to children from all New Zealand pre-school centres and primary schools. The competition celebrates New Zealand’s internationally well-regarded public education system – inviting teachers and students to identify and talk about what they like about school.</p>
<p>Education Aotearoa editor Jane Blaikie says the competition has really heated up over the past two weeks, with a flood of high quality entries from all over the country.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of talent and variety our there, and the artwork we’ve received certainly shows that kids love school, which is a key factor in why we’re one of the top performing systems in the world,” she says.</p>
<p>“The competition website <a href="http://www.schooliscool.org.nz">www.schooliscool.org.nz</a> is easy to use, has a fantastic search and browse facility, and encourages people to “rave” about the art work and share it on social networks”.</p>
<p>Competition judges are award-winning children’s author and illustrator Gavin Bishop, and Wellington art teacher Gretchen Buwalda.</p>
<p>Schools/centres can upload their competition entries to <a href="http://www.schooliscool.org.nz">www.schooliscool.org.nz</a> . The competition will be judged across 10 categories: 1 for early childhood, 1 each for years 1-8, and one for digital entries. Prizes have been sponsored by Edtech and individual winners will each receive an iPod Touch. The three overall winners will receive a set of 5 iPads, or a set of 3 iPads, or a set of 2iPads.</p>
<p>Entries can be either a poster, up to A3 size, or a digital entry (maximum of 2 minutes in length). Entries can be from an individual or a group. The competition closes on July 15, with winners announced in late August.</p>
