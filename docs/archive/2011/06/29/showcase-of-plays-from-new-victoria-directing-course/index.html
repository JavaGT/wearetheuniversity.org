<p>Showcase of plays from new Victoria directing course</p>
<p>This July the Theatre Programme of Victoria University of Wellington presents the premiere season of student directed productions from a challenging new theatre course-THEA 406: Advanced Directing.</p>
<p>The new course was created to give students an opportunity to further their directing skills at a more advanced level. THEA 406 also functions as a stepping stone to the popular Master of Theatre Arts in Directing (MTA) programme, co-taught by Victoria and Toi Whakaari: NZ Drama School.</p>
<p>&quot;THEA 406 takes directing at Victoria to an exciting new level with some of our best and brightest students taking a leadership role in creating the theatre of the future,&quot; says Senior Theatre Lecturer David O&#39;Donnell.</p>
<p>EATING DIRT, SWEATING MUD: A Transformation of Theory Into Practice, showcases four 30 minute plays a night over two weeks. Victoria University&#39;s Studio 77 will be transformed through four different set and lighting designs to suit the four different plays.</p>
<p>Two of the students, Jen Eccles and Travis Graham, have incorporated their THEA 489 theoretical research into the development of their THEA 406 directing pieces.</p>
<p>&quot;In my THEA 489 I&#39;m researching set design, and THEA 406 has allowed me to explore this research in practice. The set design of my play has really influenced the way I have directed it,&quot; says Jen Eccles, who is directing Kobo Abe&#39;s The Man Who Turned into a Stick.</p>
<p>Season One also features Tenessee Williams&#39; In the Bar of a Tokyo Hotel, directed by Travis Graham. Season Two features Harold Pinter&#39;s The Lover, directed by Rachelle Fons, and Don Nigro&#39;s Seascape with Sharks and Dancer, directed by Cherie Le Quesne.</p>
