<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>29 June 2011<br><strong>Solar Kiwi bach shipped to US for competition</strong></p>
<p>A solar-powered bach designed and built by Victoria University students will begin its journey to the US from Tauranga tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Meridian First Light house is Victoria University’s entry into the US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2011 which takes place in Washington DC this September and October. The team is the first finalist ever from the Southern Hemisphere in the prestigious and highly anticipated international competition.</p>
<p>The Solar Decathlon competition challenges university teams from around the world to design, build and operate solar-powered houses that are cost-effective, energy-efficient and attractive.</p>
<p>“This is a huge milestone for us,” says Ben Jagersma, one of the original four students involved in the project. “We’re all really looking forward to the competition and it’s exciting for our house to finally be heading to the US. Next stop Washington.”</p>
<p>The house was recently assembled on Wellington’s waterfront to a fantastic public response. Over 20,000 people toured through the house over the 18-day opening period.</p>
<p>“We got to practice assembling the house ahead of the competition, which was great, and we had the opportunity to make a few adjustments too. This ‘dress rehearsal’ also helped prepare for some of the challenges in the competition such as hosting a dinner party or conducting tours of the house.</p>
<p>“The competition attracts over 300,000 visitors in Washington DC so we’ve got to get it right.”</p>

<p>The house was packed up and transported by Mainfreight from Wellington to Tauranga. Tomorrow Hamburg Süd containers and flat racks containing the house will leave the port of Tauranga to begin a four-week journey by ship to Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The student team will join the house in Washington where they will assemble the solar bach on the National Mall’s West Potomac Park in just seven days.</p>
