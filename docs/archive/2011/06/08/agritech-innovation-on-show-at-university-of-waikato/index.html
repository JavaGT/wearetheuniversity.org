<h3>Agritech innovation on show at University of Waikato</h3>
<p>The latest New Zealand university-led advances in agritech R&amp;D will be on display at a special free event to be hosted by Waikato University and its commercialisation arm, WaikatoLink, next week [SUBS: Tuesday June 14].</p>
<p>Seven universities will be showcasing cutting-edge agricultural technology research at the Agritech Innovations event at the University’s Academy of Performing Arts.</p>
<p>Designed to foster stronger working relationships between university researchers and the private sector, the event is being held on the eve of Fieldays in order to attract attendance from as many industry representatives from around the country as possible.</p>
<p>University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says there is a clear synergy between the two events.</p>
<p>“The Fieldays theme this year is Breaking Barriers to Productivity, and our researchers are working with organisations, entrepreneurial firms and individuals to find innovative ways to bring gains for producers, and also enhance the wellbeing of the communities and the environment in which they operate.”</p>
<p>R&amp;D on display will include innovations in agribusiness and supply chain management, advanced processing, biotechnology, ICT and farm automation, sustainability and organic farming, value-added crops, and animal and plant health management.</p>
<p>Waikato University will be showcasing electronic farm management systems and broadband solutions for the rural sector, research on soil carbon levels and bioactive components in honey, and the development of technology for turning protein from animal processing waste into biodegradable plastic using industry standard machinery.</p>

<p>The newly-launched Institute for Business Research will also present current research into optimum governance models for the agribusiness sector.</p>
<p>The keynote speaker at the event will be Dr Mark Harris, Global Marketing Manager, Gallagher Animal Management. He will discuss current issues affecting New Zealand&#39;s agritech industry, the importance of innovation, and the opportunity for partnering with New Zealand&#39;s universities.</p>
<p>WaikatoLink CEO Duncan Mackintosh says universities are looking to build stronger ties with agritech businesses. “Agricultural technology developed in New Zealand is a key to maintaining this country&#39;s world leadership position in agriculture and agricultural exports. New Zealand’s agritech sector is a $3 billion industry generating export sales in excess of $700 million annually.”</p>
<p>Agritech Innovations is one of a series of events spearheaded by Universities New Zealand, and supported by Business New Zealand and the University Commercialisation Offices of New Zealand (UCONZ) with funding from the Tertiary Education Commission.
