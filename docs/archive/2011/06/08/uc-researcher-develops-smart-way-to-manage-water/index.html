<p>UC researcher develops smart way to manage water</p>
<p>A University of Canterbury academic has developed new methods that can help groundwater catchment managers match users&#39; rights with scarce water resources.</p>
<p>In a paper titled &quot;Matching users&#39; rights to available groundwater&quot;, published in the journal Ecological Economics, Dr John Raffensperger (Management) outlines a number of methods that use the framework of a smart market to align users&#39; rights to available water in an efficient and sustainable manner.</p>
<p>A smart market consists of a daily or weekly auction in which commercial users trade water, cleared by a computer model. The computer model balances water in the catchment over time, ensuring rivers have flows and aquifers have sustainable levels.</p>
<p>Rather than having to find a buyer or seller and then get government approval, users buy and sell through a common &quot;pool.&quot; A catchment manager pays users who are willing to sell, and gives more water to those who would pay for it.<br>Dr Raffensperger said the amount of available groundwater in a catchment changes quickly, and the amount of water that users can take sustainably depends on where and when it is taken.</p>
<p>&quot;However, rights to water tend to be fixed, and obtaining rights to water incurs high transaction costs. As a result, water catchments are over-allocated worldwide. In this paper, I show how a catchment manager could match users&#39; rights to the available water, in near real time, despite uncertain future inflows, while making effective use of all available hydrological data,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Dr Raffensperger said the smart market framework provides a way to adjust initial rights &quot;and the auction revenue reflects the available water relative to users&#39; rights&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;When the auction is revenue neutral, the catchment may be viewed as allocated perfectly. I suggest several ways in which a catchment manager can find this revenue-neutral allocation, assuming the manager has authority to adjust initial rights.&quot;</p>
<p>He said rather than under or over-allocation, water in the catchment can be allocated perfectly using these methods.</p>
<p>&quot;If rights can be adjusted, these allocation methods will work despite future uncertainty.&quot;</p>
