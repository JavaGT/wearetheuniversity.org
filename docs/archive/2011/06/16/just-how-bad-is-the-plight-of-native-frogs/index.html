<p>Just how bad is the plight of native frogs? How are kakapo or tuatara doing?</p>
<p>A Victoria University professor has used statistical techniques to estimate numbers in animal populations, providing accurate data that are essential to conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Professor Shirley Pledger, an international expert in this area, will explore how statistics has helped conservation in her inaugural professorial lecture at Victoria University next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Her research has built on the &#39;capture-recapture&#39; method used by scientists.</p>
<p>&quot;Capture-recapture is a technique that provides accurate estimates of animals, including any that remain hidden,&quot; says Professor Pledger. &quot;It gives us data so we know what we&#39;re dealing with. For instance, do we need to concentrate more on removing predators? Where are numbers strong?&quot;</p>
<p>Using the technique, scientists capture a sample of animals, mark them then release them. Later they capture another sample and use the proportion of marked animals that are recaptured to estimate the total animal population.</p>
<p>Professor Pledger&#39;s research has focused on improving the capture-recapture method, trying different models to accurately estimate the numbers of animals.</p>
<p>&quot;Some animals are bold, some shy, some move around. Scientists either surveyed &#39;closed&#39; populations, which is a kind of snapshot, or &#39;open&#39; populations over a length of time that saw births, deaths and migrations. The outstanding problem for 20 years or so was that most surveys typically underestimated population sizes-now that&#39;s much less of an issue.&quot;</p>
<p>As well as working with biologists at Victoria and other institutions in New Zealand, Professor Pledger has strong international connections.</p>
<p>Her statistical work forms part of a US computer package for surveying animal populations.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says Victoria&#39;s inaugural lecture series is an opportunity for professors to provide family, friends, colleagues and the wider community with an insight into their specialist area of study.</p>
<p>&quot;It is also an opportunity for the University to celebrate and acknowledge our valued professors,&quot; says Professor Walsh.</p>
