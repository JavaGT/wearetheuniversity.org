<p>Royal Society of New Zealand Amendment Bill<br>Rahui Katene, MP for Te Tai Tonga<br>Wednesday 15 June 2011</p>
<p>I am really pleased to take this call on the Royal Society of New Zealand Amendment Bill following the call of the member who has just resumed her seat, Maryan Street, because it was -</p>
<p>Hon Maryan Street : Very erudite.</p>
<p>Rahui Katene : It really was, it was great. To be able to follow her comments about the supplementary order paper put up by Te Ururoa Flavell is very important, because it is so important that we have these issues considered by the Royal Society and in the Royal Society Amendment Bill.</p>
<p>There is a really big problem with the teaching of history in our New Zealand schools. In the curriculum it states that schools are supposed to be teaching New Zealand history, and as part of that New Zealand history we would expect those schools to be talking about Maori history, but in fact we find that so many schools do not.,</p>
<p>We hope that by having the amendment that is moved on this Supplementary Order Paper included in this bill the Royal Society of New Zealand will take that provision very seriously and put pressure on the schools to take the teaching of New Zealand history very seriously.</p>
<p>I think it is also entirely appropriate to discuss at this time a new development that has occurred in the month since the time this Bill was last discussed – and that is the discussion that has occurred around cultural competencies.</p>
<p>The Minister of Maori Affairs has made mention of Tataiako, a school-based cultural competency programme, thatis expected to be formally launched this year. It is a professional development programme to help teachers relate to Maori students.<br>And I want to refer to a release put out by Nga Kura a Iwi o Aotearoa in the name of its chairman, Pem Bird. In that release he states:</p>

<p>Research and experience clearly demonstrates the connection between culturally aware and attuned teachers and Maori learner achievement. ….</p>
<p>The pivotal issue is about the authenticity and relevance of our cultural landscape which ought to permeate our thinking and practice. We have now been presented with a golden opportunity to make the difference that counts”.</p>
<p>The Royal Society of New Zealand Amendment Bill – and specifically the amendment from my colleague, Te Ururoa Flavell incorporates the humanities into the objects and functions of the Society. In essence, the substance of humanities is also about the expression of cultural competency.</p>
<p>As Mr Flavell’s explanatory note to the Supplementary Order Paper states, The Supplementary Order Paper amends the Royal Society of New Zealand Amendment Bill to include in the definition of humanities Māori studies, te reo, and the recognition, application, and advancement of te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
<p>This is a simple but effective strategy to remember that for Maori – this is our natural home – Maori are here forever. This is about marking out our cultural landscape.</p>
<p>But it is also about adding balance in the bill to identify and distinguish it as home-grown, a truly New Zealand bill.</p>
<p>The definition of humanities: would include languages, and in particular, te reo, history, religion, philosophy, law, classics, linguistics, cultural studies, Māori studies, media studies, art history, film, drama, and the studies of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
<p>This is a comprehensive, robust and one would think thoroughly practical suggestion and I hope that all of the Committee will be able to support the Supplementary Order Paper.</p>
<p>Over the last fortnight the education sector has been responding enthusiastically and responsibly, to the proposed new direction of cultural competency.</p>
<p>NZEI president Ian Leckie promoted the need for solid resourcing and ongoing professional development. His view was that it&#39;s important that any training in te reo and tikanga Maori is backed up by regular opportunities for teachers to enhance their knowledge and skills in the classroom.</p>
<p>In this Bill, the Royal Society of New Zealand Amendment Bill, we now have explicit proposals which encompass the cultural landscape of Aotearoa through respect and acknowledgment of the significance of the Treaty, of te reo Maori, of tangata whenua.<br>I acknowledge the Minister of Science and Innovation, Dr Mapp, for his willingness to work with Mr Flavell to consider this amendment to this Bill; and I welcome the acknowledgment from the Labour Party.</p>
<p>I hope, that in the spirit of a maturing nationhood, we will enjoy unanimous and enthusiastic support for this amendment right across the Committee. Kia ora.</p>
