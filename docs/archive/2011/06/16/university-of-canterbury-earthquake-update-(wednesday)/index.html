<p>University of Canterbury Earthquake Update (Wednesday)</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury is on track to resume full operations by Monday 20 June, following this week’s earthquake aftershocks.</p>
<p>This evening Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr has announced revised examination arrangements, saying the University has given careful consideration to input from staff and students and representations from the University of Canterbury Students’ Association (UCSA).</p>
<p>“Given recent events the University is aware that many students and staff are experiencing significant upset and stress and our approach has taken this into account. We are aiming to strike the right balance between those students wishing to sit exams to improve their grades, and those whose lives and homes have been significantly disrupted as a result of Monday’s aftershocks. We have also tried to build in more study time and are working hard to ensure study space is available as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Key points</p>
<p>• In some cases there will be no final exam as sufficient academic material has been assessed to determine a final grade.</p>
<p>• In some cases the assessment is being changed from an exam to a take-home test.</p>
<p>• The University will proceed with exams in the period Monday 20 June – Saturday 25 June (exams previously scheduled for Saturday 18 June move to Monday 20 and so on).</p>
<p>• Aegrotat assessments will be available to all students.</p>
<p>• Specific arrangements are being made for Communications Disorders, Education, Engineering and Bridging Programmes.</p>
<p>* Semester break is confirmed to be 26 June to 8 July. The University intends to re-open for Semester 2 as scheduled on Monday 11 July.</p>
<p>• All students will automatically be eligible for an aegrotat assessment due to current circumstances.</p>
<p>Buildings</p>
<p>Dr Carr says structural and services assessments of buildings on campus have continued today.</p>
<p>“We are continuing to make our best efforts to restore general access on 20 June to all those buildings that were approved for general access prior to the earthquakes on 13 June. It is important to note, however, that safety concerns take priority and no building will be released for general access until it has been checked according to UC standards.”<br>ends</p>
