<p><strong>Environment Protection Authority Bill – committee stage</strong><br><strong>Rahui Katene, Environment spokesperson for the Maori Party</strong><br><strong>Thursday 5 May 2011</strong></p>
<p>As I prepared for this debate today, I glanced at an epanui newsletter that suddenly landed in my inbox.</p>
<p>It was a newsletter from the Commission for Environmental, Economic, and Social Policy, chaired New Zealand’s own environmental expert and indigenous leading academic, Aroha Te Pareake Mead.</p>
<p>The newsletter was headed with a statement of vision:</p>
<p><em><strong>“A world where equity is at the root of a dynamic harmony between peoples and nature, as well as among peoples”.</strong></em></p>
<p>There wouldn’t be a better model out there, to demonstrate the meaning of these words, than the global conference held by this Commissioner earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Sharing Power conference was a unique partnership between Te Runanga o Ngati Awa, Te Whare Wananga o Awanuiarangi; the International Union for Conservation of Nature; and participants from right across the globe.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker, we come to this Environment Protection Authority Bill absolutely committed to the ideal of <em><strong>“A world where equity is at the root of a dynamic harmony</strong></em> “.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no question that we needed to uphold a commitment to this ideal, when considering the matters of national significance that this Bill – and this Authority must deal to:</p>
<p>• Such as issues called in under the <strong>RMA 1991</strong><br>• The functions inherent in the Environmental Risk Management Authority under the <strong>Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996</strong>;<br>• Or some other function such as the Emissions Trading Scheme under the <strong>Climate Change Response Act 2002.</strong><br>•<br>What’s more, from the point of view of tangata whenua there is a lot at stake. All of the consultation has promoted the need for:</p>

<p>Maori representation on decision-making boards to be increased to at least two representatives<br>The establishment of a statutory Maori advisory committee<br>The committee should not be seen as a substitute for local iwi engagement and<br>Iwi had a clear preference that the EPA be established as a stand alone Crown Agent.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker, I’m not going to dwell further into the detail of implementation other than say that we in the Maori Party were concerned to ensure the balance; the equilibrium of so many competing priorities.</p>
<p>We believe we have achieved this balance with two simple amendments to clause 3; which state that :</p>
<p><em>In order to recognise and respect the Crown’s responsibility to take account of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi and to maintain opportunities for Māori to contribute to decision-making under an environmental Act, Part 2 of this Act establishes the Māori Advisory Committee.</em></p>
<p><em>All persons exercising powers and functions of the EPA under an environmental Act shall apply any Treaty of Waitangi provision in that environmental Act.</em></p>
<p>We believe these two new clauses give effect to the principles of te Tiriti o Waitangi in a way which will recognize and respect the responsibility of the Crown to do the right thing.</p>
<p>These clauses do not interfere with any of the specific Treaty provisions in the environmental acts such as the Resource Management Act 1991; the Hazardous Substances and new organisms act 1996; and the Climate Change Response Act of 2002.</p>
<p>They should not create interpretation difficulties or increase the risk of a judicial view.</p>
<p>We appreciate the support of the Minister and his officials in helping us to come to a meeting point where we could agree on a mechanism to actively protect Maori interests, and to give effect to the principles of the Treaty.</p>
<p>We hope it will also meet favour with other parties across the House.</p>
