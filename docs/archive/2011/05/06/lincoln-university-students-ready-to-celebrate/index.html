<p><strong>Press Release 6 May 2011 – For Immediate Release</strong></p>
<p>“Lincoln University Students ready to Celebrate”</p>
<p>Lincoln University students will take to the streets today as they prepare to graduate in the new and recently dedicated Lincoln Events Centre. The Centre will be the venue for the 2011 Lincoln University Graduation following the damage to the Christchurch Town Hall where celebrations were held since 1994.</p>

<p>“Obviously we are delighted that our students are able to participate in a Graduation ceremony after what have been such trying times for so many people. Graduations were held on the Lincoln University campus prior to 1994 and so it’s really nice to bring it home so to speak” says Lincoln University Students’ Association President, Ivy Harper.</p>
<p>“Graduation is the culmination of years of study, hard work and sacrifice. It’s an opportunity to celebrate and acknowledge student achievement and success in such a wonderful way and the Association looks forward to sharing the day with the graduands, says Ivy Harper.</p>
<p>The University will host two ceremonies today, and with weather permitting, each ceremony will be preceded by a procession of the graduands. The procession will take students past many iconic buildings on the University campus including Ivey Hall which houses the George Forbes Memorial Library, and Memorial Hall which was damaged in the first quake.</p>
<p>“The celebrations today will be a mix of both excitement and sadness. Excitement as students look to the future and all the promise that it holds, and sadness as they are reminded of the past as the procession passes Memorial Hall on campus, and the Famous Grouse Hotel in the Lincoln township. Both buildings were damaged in the September quake and are a tangible reminder of the events of the past few months”, notes Harper.</p>
<p>“Students will be able to share Graduation today with family and friends in recognition of their wonderful achievement, and later tonight they can celebrate with friends and fellow graduates at the annual Graduation Ball which is hosted by the Association”, writes Ivy Harper.</p>
<p>The Association has been beset this year with a number of challenges including issues surrounding the Canterbury earthquakes, and the long-running Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill, which if passed will have a devastating impact on students associations throughout New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Students in Canterbury are continuing to face ongoing challenges as a result of the two earthquakes. While the Association will continue to support, advocate and represent students, the services that the Association provide will be compromised should the Bill be passed”, contends Ivy Harper.</p>
