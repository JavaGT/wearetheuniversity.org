<p><strong>Thursday, 5 May 2011, 11:17 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions">New Zealand Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Unemployment Persistently High</strong></p>
<p>Today’s unemployment figures showing 155,000 people or 6.6 percent of people out of work shows that unemployment is remaining persistently high. The level of 155,000 people out of work compares with 90,000 unemployed in June 2008.</p>
<p>The jobless number which includes those discouraged from looking for work is 271,400. Although part time employment has increased there are still 103,600 part timers seeking additional hours of work to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Peter Conway, CTU Secretary, says that “these figures send a message to the Government that it simply has to do more to support the unemployed”.</p>
<p>Youth unemployment has spiked upwards to 27.5 percent, Māori unemployment has gone up to 16.1 percent and Pacific people have an unemployment rate of 14 percent.</p>
<p>And women also appear to be disadvantaged with an unemployment rate of 7 percent compared with men at 6.2 percent. We also note that the “all except Canterbury” figures show a smaller fall in the rate of unemployment – from 6.8% to 6.7%.</p>
<p>Peter Conway said “it is true that we live in tough times. But things are toughest for those on low incomes struggling to make ends meet and those without a job. They should be a priority for any Government.”</p>
<p>The Government could expand the skills investment subsidy to encourage employers to take on a worker, establish more schemes like Enhanced Task Force Green, reinstate Community Max, ensure that training agreements are required alongside government procurement and ensure that the Government stimulus to the economy is job-rich.</p>
