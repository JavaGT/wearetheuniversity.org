<p>Christchurch<br>LABOUR MPs</p>
<p>5 May 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Christchurch Earthquake bulletin edition 37</strong></p>
<p>The Labour Party’s Christchurch electorate MPs, <strong>Clayton Cosgrove (Waimakariri), Ruth Dyson (Port Hills), Lianne Dalziel (Christchurch East) and Brendon Burns (Christchurch Central)</strong> have started a regular bulletin to keep people in their electorates and media informed about what is happening at grass roots level.</p>
<p><strong>CLAYTON COSGROVE:</strong> The more small businesses I talk to, the more concerned I am about what’s going to happen to businesses and to jobless numbers in Canterbury when the business recovery package is phased out shortly. The Government’s ‘business mentoring’ scheme doesn’t cut the mustard as far as many small businesses are concerned because most don’t need advice on how to run their business --- they have been doing it for many years --- but they need practical assistance to re-start. Businesses tell me that the simple reality for business is that cash flow is king. Time and time again I am being told stories like: “We need to get out of our munted building, we need to find a new site, we need to refit and re-stock, so that we can continue to trade and employ our staff”. What they are saying makes sense. Of course, an independent assessment is needed to establish whether individual businesses have a future or not, but generally businesses know how to run themselves, and if they think they still have a good shot at success, and they meet certain business criteria, they should be backed. Otherwise job losses will multiply and the region’s commercial future will be undermined for years to come. Businesses don’t need simply mentoring as such, but they do need practical support to get back on to a solid basis. That may have to come in the form of low-interest loans to re-site, refit, re-stock and modernise, but if the loans are accompanied by independent assessment as to viability, individual businesses, Canterbury people and Canterbury itself will benefit considerably. Businesses don’t want hand-outs, but they do want practical help to keep going. It is worth recalling what Professor David Deakins of Massey University’s Centre for Small to Medium Enterprise said a week or so ago --- that up to 40 per cent of small companies in Christchurch could eventually fold following the quake. We must not let that happen, but time is running out. Some are just hanging on, but they can’t do so indefinitely. There’s one building construction business I am familiar with that is the sort of company that will be desperately needed when the rebuild finally gets underway, but businesses like this are in danger of disappearing before the rebuild starts. That will just compound our problems. The Government’s preoccupation with short-term so-called ‘fixes’ like mentoring instead of thinking ahead and embracing long-term practical solutions could well be extremely damaging to our future.</p>

<p><strong>RUTH DYSON:</strong> I am really delighted that the deaf community have noticed the changing attitude towards NZ Sign Language, and particularly that they link this with the use of NZSL during the community briefings post the earthquakes. I was the Minister who introduced the legislation to make NZSL our third official language and am very pleased that it is continuing to make such a positive difference. The news this week that the Department of Building and Housing has spent over $1million on campervans at the Showground but that no one is in them is very concerning. I have been worried about the temporary housing situation and feel that the Minister, Gerry Brownlee, should be having another look at whether the idea of new temporary houses in parks is the best idea, because we don’t want a repeat of the situation with the campervans, particularly given that the temporary houses are going to be taking up valuable recreation grounds.</p>
<p><strong>LIANNE DALZIEL:</strong> I am concerned about the Government’s failure to both analyse the need for and consult about the quantity, style and location of temporary accommodation in Christchurch. We can see that 350 Government-supplied campervans for displaced residents are sitting empty; we know that parks are manned by security guards, not for the service of residents---of which there is currently only one---but to secure the assets. Critical questions are going unanswered. What action is this Government taking to assess the on-going needs of displaced residents? It is impossible for them to get a handle on what is required if they don’t do the ground work. It is not rocket science, and reflects my wider concern that the government’s lack of planning is having a negative impact on the daily lives of Cantabrians. I read that DBH was planning to locate temporary housing in Rāwhiti Domain and in a Burwood location in the Press. I believe that my Christchurch East constituents, who are affected by being relocated on the one hand and being the receiving community on the other, are entitled to consultation. I attended the Burwood-Pegasus Community Board meeting last Monday night, because I saw on the agenda that a DBH representative was making a presentation to them about the temporary housing. Prior to that presentation, there was a deputation from the Christchurch Archery Club that highlighted the fact that the location of the housing destroyed the only target range that meets the international standard. The individual concerned showed a very simple alternative approach that would preserve the archery. This was the first time that the members of the community board (which includes the two councillors for the area) had seen the DBH maps. It is not acceptable that DBH would turn up to such a briefing without checking that this basic information had been provided ahead of time. I have had many inquiries about the amount of rental accommodation that is available in Christchurch which seems to continue to outstrip demand. I accept that people are avoiding private rentals because of the limit on their alternative accommodation insurance cover (6-12 months) and the fact that the government subsidy that kicks in then doesn’t meet the full cost of most accommodation. But it is an issue. Would it be more cost-effective to rent this accommodation on behalf of people and rent it back at the subsidised rate?</p>
<p><strong>BRENDON BURNS:</strong> Concerns were expressed on Morning Report today about time delays for contractors getting paid by EQC and homeowners sometimes having to temporarily fund their own repairs. These issues are a good reminder of the role that we as constituency MPs are able to play. Each of us has access to a hotline to EQC. While we cannot resolve every issue, the response rate from EQC is usually pretty good. Similarly, a quick scan of my inbox over the last 12 hours shows a range of other issues that we as MPs are being called on to try and assist. A school principal who has lost 20 percent of the roll since the quake --- the losses exacerbated by a lack of housing; an Avonside resident who says he’s still got blocked drains and sewers; an Avon Loop resident who wants to establish whether those who demolish her damaged house will clear the section, and leave the paving stones, and whether she has access to the property afterwards; and a community group that has just got its latest insurance invoice and found the cost of covering its small community building has doubled. I have also been encouraging some people to put their names forward for the Community Forum of 20 or so people established under CERA. Tomorrow, I am chairing a meeting of IConIC, Interests in Conserving the Identity of Christchurch, which brings together building owners and heritage advocates and tomorrow night I am addressing a meeting in St Albans on the role of the community in rebuilding Christchurch.</p>
