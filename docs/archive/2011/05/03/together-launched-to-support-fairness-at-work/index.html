<p>CTU Media Release</p>

<p>‘Together’ launched to support fairness at work</p>
<p>Fair treatment at work makes a significant advance this week with the launch of Together, a radically new type of organisation which will extend union association to thousands of new workers.</p>
<p>“Union members understand that working together ensures a better deal for workers, but many New Zealanders don’t have access to a union. People in non-unionised workplaces, casual workers and employees in small businesses may simply not be able to get union coverage at work. Together offers low threshold membership to workers in these un-unionised workplaces and sectors.” Said Helen Kelly, President of the CTU.</p>
<p>Together is a new organisation established and run by the unions affiliated to the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions. Together aims to connect workers in un-unionised work places with the union movement and the union experience. Membership, costing just $1 per week ($52 per year), gives employees and contractors, in industries and locations without union support, access to help and expert advice.</p>
<p>Together also offers family/whanau membership giving the opportunity for current union members to join up as many of their family and whanau as they want for just $1 per week. Family/whanau membership makes their family part of the union family and gives them the values and benefits union members share.</p>
<p>“Together is perfect for people working in industries like IT, tourism or in small shops, driving taxis or on casual contacts who don’t currently have any support. Together will also provide coverage for people who work in remote areas and smaller towns who don’t currently have access to a union.” said Kelly.</p>

<p>“These people face many of the same workplace issues as people who work in bigger, unionised industries, but don’t have the same support available to them. Together will provide support and advice when they need help with issues like workplace bullying, sick leave, holiday pay, employment agreements and sexual harassment. Together will give them that support and join them to the wider union movement” said Helen Kelly.</p>
