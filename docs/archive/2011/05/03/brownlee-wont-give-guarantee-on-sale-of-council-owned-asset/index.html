<p>Clayton Cosgrove</p>
<p>Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson</p>
<p>3 May 2011</p>
<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Brownlee Won’t Give Guarantee on Sale of Council-Owned Assets</strong></p>
<p>Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has categorically and repeatedly refused to guarantee to Canterbury people today that he and his Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) won’t force councils to sell their assets, the Labour Party says.</p>
<p>Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove says Mr Brownlee said yesterday that CERA has the power to ‘suggest’ to local councils they should sell assets to help pay for the recovery, but there is actually nothing in the legislation to prevent such sales being compelled.</p>
<p>“Mr Brownlee trashed a Labour amendment to the legislation that would have precluded the Government forcing such sales on the Canterbury councils. He wouldn’t have a bar of it because he wanted to cover all of his bases in case of unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>“I gave him another opportunity in Parliament today to guarantee that he will prevent such sales happening.</p>
<p>“He wouldn’t do so,” Clayton Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“He says that he and CERA intend to work collaboratively with the Christchurch City Council.</p>
<p>“Why won’t he guarantee that he and CERA won’t come the heavy on Canterbury councils if that’s the case?</p>
<p>“How can he be trusted?”</p>
