<p>Auckland Transport’s upgrade of Alfred Street is nearing completion. As from Monday 30 May the road will reopen for authorised vehicular use (Except buses). The road and parking rules for Alfred Street remain unchanged from those in place before the works commenced.</p>
<p>With the reopening it is important that all users are reminded that pedestrian safety is paramount in this shared environment. Pedestrians should be aware of traffic movement in the area and use caution when crossing the street. Any authorised vehicles entering the street must use extreme caution when manoeuvring within the area to safeguard pedestrians.</p>
<p>To help manage the safe transition back to joint vehicular and pedestrian use, Auckland Transport parking enforcement officers, NZ Police, and Unisafe officers will work together to monitor activity in the street, to advise, and enforce the rules.</p>
