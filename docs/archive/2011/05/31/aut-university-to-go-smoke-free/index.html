<p><strong>AUT University to Go Smoke-Free</strong></p>
<p>AUT University announced today that its three teaching campuses in Auckland will become smoke-free.</p>
<p>This extends the current prohibition to all buildings and open spaces within the City, North Shore and Manukau campuses.</p>
<p>AUT Vice Chancellor Derek McCormack says the decision will help provide a healthier environment for students, staff and visitors, and is consistent with AUT’s position as a leading university in health-science education and research.</p>
<p>“The decision to be smoke-free is very much in keeping with our strong focus on research and teaching in health and sports science disciplines,” says Derek.</p>
<p>AUT already provides a range of support services to staff and students to help them quit smoking.</p>
<p>The university will spend the rest of this year working closely with staff and students to implement the plan from 1 February 2012.</p>
<p>“We have a large cohort of staff and students who will welcome this decision. Many staff and students have advocated for smoke- free spaces in forums and student publications.”</p>
<p>McCormack said the decision aligned with the University of Auckland’s smoke-free status, along with Auckland Council’s plans to make parks across the region smoke-free.</p>
<p>“Our neighbour, the University of Auckland, has successfully implemented a smoke-free policy, so in joining forces we collectively provide a smoke-free Learning Quarter in the city.”</p>
<p>Ben Youdan, from anti-smoking lobby group ASH says the decision is a great move as it will help young people to live a smoke-free life.</p>
<p>“Not only is this good for staff and students at AUT but it will also have positive health implications for the wider community. We’re delighted,” he says.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health recognises smoking as the leading cause of preventable illness and death in New Zealand.</p>
