<p>Students Take On Global Virtual Communications</p>
<p>Small local businesses now have the opportunity to take on international clients, without even leaving the office, thanks to recent improvements in global virtual communications pioneered by AUT University.</p>
<p>The University’s 25 postgraduate public relations students have been exploring new theories of global communications over the last three months, while creating an authentic communications campaign for a global company with peers from universities around the world.</p>
<p>The project’s global team mentor, AUT senior lecturer Averill Gordon, says the opportunity offers kiwis the opportunity to be at the forefront of current international business.</p>
<p>“It’s a unique concept that pits global virtual PR teams together in a competitive academic environment, so these students are really pioneers in this type of study,” she said.</p>
<p>Gordon, who is researching global virtual teams for her PhD, says the project - called GlobCom - presents real challenges in working with different cultures, languages and time zones using a variety of technologies.</p>
<p>As part of the project, the students will get the chance to meet their international teammates when they present their campaign face-to-face with their client, Carl Zeiss, next month in Barcelona, Spain.</p>
<p>Even though it will be a great opportunity to see this project through to completion and represent New Zealand on the world stage, many of the students are struggling to finance this educational trip.</p>
<p>One of the students, Scott McKee, is leading the fund-raising efforts which have all been inspired by their intended destination.</p>
<p>“We’ve already held a Spanish themed fiesta night, where people from the community had a great time learning salsa with a Spanish dancing expert,” says Scott.</p>
<p>“Our next big event will be a Spanish film premier at Bridgeway Theatre in Northcote tonight, where we will be showing Biutiful, the Cannes festival winner, starring heart-throb Javier Bardem.”</p>
