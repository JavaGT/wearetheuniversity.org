<p>National’s Budget: A hurdle not a hand for students</p>
<p>For those wanting to get back into the workforce or up-skill, things have just got a whole lot harder, says David Shearer Labour’s spokesperson for Tertiary Education.</p>
<p>“National makes a big song and dance about wanting to get people back to work, while announcing policies which do the opposite,” David Shearer said.</p>
<p>“National’s Budget stopped part-time students from gaining access to up to $1000 [figure corrected] in course-related costs. This money is important to easing some of the practical hurdles to successful study like stationary and printing costs.</p>
<p>“At Massey University 68% of part-time students are women, and many are mothers trying to up-skill to re-enter the workforce. Many Maori and Pasifika students also study part-time as they juggle work as well.</p>
<p>“National’s Budget didn’t only hinder part-time students. It also stopped people aged over 55 from accessing student loans. That simply discriminates against older people wanting to re-skill. Remember most of these people have been paying taxes all their lives and donate much of their time to the voluntary sector.</p>
<p>“New Zealand needs a skilled workforce. Today, people are working well into their sixties. Labour wants to help people into new work opportunities, not put obstacles in their way,” David Shearer said.</p>
<p>“Nearly two years ago $13 million was stripped from Adult Education which stopped tens of thousands of people from attending night school. Again, for hundreds and hundreds of New Zealanders that was their route back to learning new skills for better jobs. For many their second chance at getting an education was squandered by the National Government.</p>
<p>“All governments have choices. Just 280 metres of National’s Holiday Highway would fund night school classes for a year. What’s more important? A road to get people to their baches in Omaha faster? Or up-skilling New Zealanders to kick-start a high-paid, high-skilled economy,” David Shearer said.</p>
