<p><strong>Labour MPs welcome Roger Sutton</strong></p>
<p>Canterbury’s Labour MPs are welcoming the appointment of Roger Sutton to the position of Chief Executive of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA).</p>
<p>The four MPs Clayton Cosgrove, Ruth Dyson, Lianne Dalziel and Brendon Burns said today: “Roger Sutton is a passionate, committed and energetic Cantabrian. He understands the people and the issues we have been dealing with since September 4 last year.”</p>
<p>“He has shown outstanding leadership in his role as Chief Executive of Orion, with a demonstrated commitment to working in an open and transparent way with members of our community,” the MPs said.</p>
<p>Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove said: “The challenge now for Minister Brownlee is to ensure that the government department model that he chose for CERA can be responsive to Mr Sutton’s style of leadership.</p>
<p>“We all know how effective Mr Sutton is, but Gerry Brownlee needs to give him plenty of scope so he can show his initiative to best advantage,” Clayton Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>The four MPs said that Mr Sutton, as the Chairperson of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority, has a deep understanding of and commitment to “warming and drying the homes of our residents – an issue of primary importance as we head into the depths of winter.</p>
<p>“We will continue to work constructively with Roger Sutton in his new role, leading the recovery of our region,” the MPs said.</p>
