<p><strong>Thursday, 12 May 2011, 5:59 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Council_of_Trade_Unions">Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>CTU Welcomes the Investment in Training and Skills for the Canterbury Area</strong></p>
<p>The CTU welcomes today’s announcement of additional investment in training and skills for the Canterbury area, but cautions that there needs to be a strategic and coordinated approach to training and investment in the right skills needed for the people of Christchurch.</p>
<p>Marty Braithwaite, CTU spokesperson on earthquake-related matters said “We are glad to see resource being put into training and skill development for the Canterbury area. There needs to be a strategic and coordinated approach based on sound analysis of current and future needs. We hope the government has the right mix with this package.”</p>
<p>“Cantabrians are resourceful and we want to see as many local people as possible have the opportunity up-skill in time to play a constructive part in the city’s re-build.”</p>
<p>Braithwaite concludes “It’s also vital that the worker support packages continue until we start to see affected workers satisfactorily back into work or training. It’s crucial that these people are adequately covered during this transitional period.”</p>
