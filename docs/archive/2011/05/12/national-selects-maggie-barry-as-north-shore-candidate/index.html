<p><strong>Thursday, 12 May 2011, 9:47 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National Selects Maggie Barry as North Shore Candidate</p>
<p>National Party North Shore Electorate Chair Lorraine Campbell is pleased to announce that Maggie Barry will be the Party&#39;s North Shore candidate for the upcoming General Election.</p>
<p>&quot;The level of interest in this selection underscores the enthusi­asm within the Party in election year. I want to thank everyone who has taken part in the process.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As an electorate, we pay tribute to Defence Minister Wayne Mapp for his service to our community and wish him well for his future endeavours.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Party values the support we receive from the North Shore and we are delighted to have Maggie as our candidate to contest the November 26 election.</p>
<p>Barry says she is looking forward to the opportunity of fighting for the privilege to represent the people of North Shore.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the North Shore historically being a strong National seat, I plan to campaign hard to earn the trust and respect of this community.</p>
<p>&quot;For our community, this election is about maintaining the North Shore&#39;s strong, consistent voice in the National Gov­ernment.</p>
<p>&quot;As I have travelled around this electorate I sense the community understands National&#39;s plan to grow the economy, to start living within our means as a country, deliver enduring jobs, and build the critical infrastructure to future proof New Zealand and our region.</p>
<p>&quot;As we emerge from the recession, and the disaster that has hit Canterbury, it has become even more impor­tant for our Government to make sensible spending decisions so future generations of Kiwis aren&#39;t left with a legacy of debt.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that John Key&#39;s reliable and proven leadership is critically important for our country&#39;s future and will be doing my utmost to insure it continues.&quot;</p>
<p>Barry&#39;s entry into politics follows a thirty-year career in broadcasting, best known for her television roles on One News and Maggie&#39;s Garden Show.</p>
<p>As a Chair of the New Zealand Book Council, Patron of Hospice New Zealand, and Member of the Institute of Directors until 2010, Barry&#39;s candidacy for the North Shore Seat adds to a history of service to the community and business stretching as long as her broadcasting career.</p>
<p>Barry is mother to teenager Jo and enjoys the strong support of her partner Grant Kerr. Barry has vouched to move into the electorate if elected.</p>
<p>&quot;The family and I would be very proud to call the North Shore home.</p>
