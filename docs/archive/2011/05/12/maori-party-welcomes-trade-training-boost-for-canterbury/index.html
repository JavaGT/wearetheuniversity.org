<p><strong>Maori Party Welcomes Trade Training boost for Canterbury</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rahui Katene, MP for Te Tai Tonga</strong><br><strong>Thursday 12 May 2011</strong></p>
<p>Te Tai Tonga MP Rahui Katene is thrilled that today’s announcements from tertiary education Minister Steven Joyce will enable additional support for Maori trainees.</p>
<p>“Current figures suggest that there are some 500 young Maori (aged between 16-24 years) in the Canterbury region receiving the unemployment benefit as of the end of April” said Mrs Katene.</p>
<p>“The announcement today of an additional $42 million for trade training, is a huge boost to the morale and motivation of young Maori in this region, with the promise of at least 200 placements for Maori anticipated in the construction sector”.</p>
<p>“I want to commend Maori Affairs Minister, Dr Pita Sharples, for his initiative and his commitment to this <em>take</em>, since the first earthquake in September last year”</p>
<p>“This is great news that Maori will directly benefit from training and employment opportunities emerging in the Canterbury Recovery”.</p>
<p>“We are also very committed towards establishing the expectation that the capability and leadership of local Maori will be valued in the building and construction industries”.</p>
<p>“The Maori Party, Ngai Tahu and the Iwi Maori Recovery Network have been tireless advocates of a proactive response to the earthquake recovery and today’s announcements reflect the fruits of all of our labour paying off” said Mrs Katene.</p>
<p>&quot;And as for the challenge from Paula Bennett that I have been particularly &#39;pushy&#39; in calling for jobs for our young - well I&#39;m proud to own up to that! Employment is just so vital to income, to self-esteem, to that sense of making a productive contribution to our community, and I will continue to push to ensure the disproportionately high levels of Maori unemployment are addressed&quot;.</p>
