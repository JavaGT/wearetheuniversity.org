<p>Human-Made Climate Change: A Moral, Political and Legal Issue</p>
<p>Public lecture by Dr James Hansen at Victoria University, 16 May, 5.45 to 730pm</p>
<p>NASA scientist and climate change expert Dr James Hansen will speak on human-made climate change as a moral, political and legal issue at a public lecture on Monday 16 May hosted by Victoria University&#39;s Institute of Policy Studies.</p>
<p>Dr Hansen is the Director of NASA&#39;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York and Adjunct Professor at Columbia University&#39;s Earth Institute. He is the author of Storms of my Grandchildren and is probably best known for being one of the first scientists to bring global warming to the world&#39;s attention, when he delivered Congressional testimony on climate change in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Dr Hansen, whom Time magazine named as one of the world&#39;s 100 most influential people in 2006, argues that climate change is a broad issue that needs to be solved on a number of fronts.</p>
<p>&#39;Human-made climate change is a moral issue. It pits the rich and the powerful against the young and the unborn, against the defenseless and against nature. Climate change is a political issue. But politics fails when there is a revolving door between government and the fossil fuel-industrial complex. Climate change is a legal issue. The judiciary provides the possibility of holding our governments accountable for their duty to protect the public interest.&#39;</p>
<p>Dr Hansen is visiting New Zealand this month and giving a range of talks throughout the country.</p>

<p>While in Wellington, he will also speak at a symposium on &#39;The Future of Coal&#39; on Tuesday 17 May. In recent years, he has argued strongly that the use of coal must be phased out rapidly, unless it includes carbon capture and storage.</p>
