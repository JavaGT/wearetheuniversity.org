<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Labour Selects Candidate for Te Tai Tokerau</strong></p>
<p>Labour Leader Phil Goff has confirmed that MP Kelvin Davis has been selected as the party’s candidate for the Te Tai Tokerau by-election.</p>
<p>His selection has been unanimously endorsed by the NZ Council of the Labour Party and the full Labour caucus.</p>
<p>“Kelvin is a fantastic candidate. He was born and bred in Te Tai Tokerau. It is his home turf. He is geared up and ready to hit the campaign trail with the full support of the Labour Party behind him.</p>
<p>“This by-election will cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars which certainly could be better spent elsewhere at a time when people are suffering financially. But responsibility for that decision rests with Hone Harawira.</p>
<p>“Labour is serious about contesting this seat. We are offering the people of Te Tai Tokerau a candidate who will fight for the issues that matter to them, like creating jobs, addressing the rising cost of living, investing in skills training, putting children first and stopping asset sales,” said Phil Goff.</p>
<p>Kelvin Davis says he’s looking forward to contesting the Te Tai Tokerau by-election on behalf of Labour.</p>
<p>“I grew up in Te Tai Tokerau. I’ve lived there most of my adult life and I’m raising my three children there. It is my home and I share the same desire as the rest of the community to create successful Māori futures and a better life for whānau.</p>
<p>“A crucial way of enabling Māori to fulfil their aspirations is through education. As a former school principal, I’ve worked on the frontline and know how important education is. It is my passion for education that motivated me to move into politics and it is an issue that I will campaign on in the upcoming by-election.”</p>
