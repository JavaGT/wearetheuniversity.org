<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong>10 May 2011</strong></p>
<p><strong>AUT University Annual Report Confirms a Successful First Decade</strong></p>
<p>AUT University’s 2010 Annual Report is now available online and records a successful year of achievements to mark the University’s first decade.</p>
<p>AUT experienced a continued surge in applications and enrolments in 2010, both domestic and international, which took total student numbers to over 27,000 - making AUT one of New Zealand’s largest universities. Equivalent full time students (EFTS) increased to 18,952, up from 18,063 in 2009.</p>
<p>2010 was AUT’s most successful year to date for securing research funding, with a total of $18.5M, and University research outputs increased by 25% to almost 2700.</p>
<p>The University demonstrated excellent financial management, maintaining its solid performance in meeting the 3% surplus requirement set by the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC).</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Derek McCormack said he was pleased with the University’s growth and achievements as it enters its second decade.</p>
<p>“AUT’s story has been one of growth and change as we’ve worked to establish a position as a major university with a crucial contribution to make to New Zealand’s future.</p>
<p>“Our enrolment has grown enormously over ten years with a dramatic shift in profile to degree and postgraduate level, our programme offering has expanded and diversified, and our research reputation and achievements continue to build,” said McCormack.</p>
<p>“And in growing our degree enrolment, we’ve shown our commitment to diversity, making a strong contribution to the opportunity for Aucklanders to participate in university education by pressing into communities and schools that have previously had little engagement with universities or higher education.”</p>

<p>McCormack said strong financial management was essential for ongoing growth and performance.</p>
<p>“AUT has a record of efficient and effective educational delivery and financial management. This will continue to serve us well over coming years as we deliver a range of significant projects for our students and staff, such as the new Learning Precinct on our city campus.</p>
<p>“This $97M project will transform the city campus when completed in 2013 - linking it even more strongly to the CBD and providing high-tech teaching and learning facilities for media and communication studies, as well as exceptional new public spaces and student commons.”</p>
<p>• McCormack said the new precinct was one of the priority capital projects for 2011 and 2012, along with the AUT Millennium Campus expansion on the North Shore to accommodate the Government funded National Sports Training Centre and Stage Two development of the Manukau campus in South Auckland.</p>
<p><strong>2010 Annual Report highlights include:</strong></p>
<p>• Highest ever enrolment numbers with 18,952 EFTS</p>
<p>• 91% of AUT’s graduates were in employment or further study six months after graduating</p>
<p>• Student completion rates were on target with 83% for undergraduate degree students and 90% for postgraduates. Maori results were close to comparable with the university average and Pasifika results showed a marked improvement towards that average.</p>
<p>• Success against diversity targets, with the proportion of Maori (10%) and Pasifika (12%) students exceeding the age-adjusted population proportion for the region, and a marked increase in Maori and Pasifika students studying in degree and postgraduate programmes – both up by 4%</p>
<p>• Higher than budgeted international enrolments at 2445 EFTS – AUT has the second highest number of international students in New Zealand.</p>
<p>• A 25% increase in research outputs from 2159 to 2692</p>
<p>• A 9% increase in research funding to $18.5M – up 27% on 2008, showing rapid growth</p>
<p>• Growth in the percentage of students studying in degree and postgraduate programmes from 78% to 82%, ahead of target</p>
<p>• Postgraduate enrolment is the fastest growing part of the AUT profile – 11% of domestic students in 2010 were postgraduate (an 11% increase), and 26% of international students were postgraduate (a 22.5% increase)</p>
<p>• Very low staff turnover</p>
<p>• Maintaining a high level of staff development expenditure</p>
<p>• AUT met its TEC surplus requirement and also returned an overall surplus that was well ahead of budget, due mainly to unbudgeted revenues from international enrolments and the final payment from the former Government tripartite adjustment fund*.</p>
<p>• Increased provision in all resource categories – for example, increasing total expenditure on library services by 20%.</p>
<p>*The Government Tripartite Adjustment fund supported New Zealand universities to maintain competitive academic salaries in an international market and was disestablished from 2011.</p>
