<p><strong>Friday, 13 May 2011, 2:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Brightest teaching talent recognised</strong></p>
<p>Some of New Zealand’s most outstanding new teaching talent will be acknowledged on Tuesday night as Victoria University celebrates its brightest graduates from the Faculty of Education.</p>
<p>Victoria&#39;s inaugural Teacher Education Excellence Awards will celebrate graduating students who gained an A+ average in their academic studies and performed strongly while on teaching placement in 2010.</p>
<p>Thirteen recipients from a range of teacher education programmes will receive the award and include early childhood, primary, and secondary teaching candidates.</p>
<p>Dean of the Faculty of Education, Professor Dugald Scott, says the awards acknowledge graduates who have excelled in a rigorous and demanding teaching programme.</p>
<p>&quot;Each recipient had to demonstrate a thorough understanding of teaching and learning within their chosen sector of the New Zealand education system, and each demonstrated an ability to think creatively and critically throughout their teacher education programme,&quot; says Professor Scott.</p>
<p>&quot;While all of Victoria&#39;s graduate teachers know what to teach, know how to teach, and understand the responsibilities of belonging to the teaching profession, these graduates showed high levels of critical insight into the challenges of teaching and learning in New Zealand in the 21st century. They demonstrated professional excellence in their programme.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosemary Driver, a recipient of a Teacher Education Excellence Award, has also been awarded the Ilse B Steinberger Prize in Primary Teaching, awarded annually to the top Graduate Diploma of Teaching (Primary) student in the Faculty of Education who has achieved both academic excellence and excellence in their teaching performance in the relevant year.</p>

<p>Ms Driver is now teaching in Birchwood Primary in Nelson. She is delighted to receive recognition for her studies and excited about what her new career.</p>
<p>&quot;Teaching offers me an opportunity to be socially and professionally responsive, continually changing my own practice and priorities in response to the real and diverse needs of learners, parents and colleagues, as well as the chance to indulge my own passion for broad-spectrum learning and new experiences. It is very much a &#39;get out what you put in&#39; kind of profession, and that suits me.</p>
<p>&quot;I have only just begun my career as an educator but hope that I will be able to contribute to the education and welfare of young people in New Zealand, and perhaps internationally, in a variety of ways.&quot;</p>
