<p><strong>National Selects Joanne Hayes as Dunedin South Candidate</strong><br>National Party Dunedin South Electorate Chair Robyn Broughton is pleased to announce that Joanne Hayes will be the Party’s Dunedin South candidate for the upcoming General Election.</p>
<p>“The National Party values the support we receive from the Dunedin South Electorate and we are delighted to have Joanne as our candidate to contest the November 26 election.</p>
<p>“Joanne will put her heart and soul into campaigning for the issues that matter in Dunedin South.</p>
<p>Hayes says she is humbled by the selection and looking forward to the opportunity of fighting for the privilege to represent the people of Dunedin South in John Key’s Government.</p>
<p>“For the community this election is about giving Dunedin South a strong voice in Government. The sense I get from the community is that it understands National’s plan to grow the economy, to start living within our means as a country, deliver enduring jobs, and build the critical infrastructure to future proof New Zealand and our region.</p>
<p>“As we emerge from the recession, and the disaster that has hit Canterbury, it has become even more impor¬tant for our Government to make sensible spending decisions so future generations of Kiwis aren’t left with a legacy of debt.</p>
<p>“I believe that John Key’s reliable and proven leadership is critically important for our country’s future and will be doing my utmost to insure it continues.”</p>
<p>Hayes has a strong background in health, business, and agriculture. She is currently the Chief Executive of Ngai Tai O Te Awa Trust.</p>
<p>Of Scottish and Maori descent, Hayes was raised in the rural community of Rangiwahia and attended Massey University. A mother of two, Hayes currently lives in the Manawatu with her husband Pat, and will move to Dunedin in June.</p>
