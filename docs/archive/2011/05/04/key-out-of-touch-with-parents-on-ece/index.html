<h3>Key out of touch with parents on ECE</h3>
<p>John Key demonstrated how out of touch he is with the effect of his decisions on NZ children and their families by continuing to deny that Early Childhood Education fees have gone up, Labour ECE spokesperson Sue Moroney says.</p>
<p>“John Key’s denials fly in the face of Statistics NZ data showing that the cost of Early Childhood Education to families has gone up by 12% in the last 12 months,” Sue Moroney said.</p>
<p>“His denials are offensive to the thousands of families who are struggling to pay increased fees because funding was cut to the centres their children attend.</p>
<p>“New Zealand families already struggling with the cost of living, because of rising food prices, increasing GST and wages that aren’t rising are paying more because of the decisions John Key has made.</p>
<p>“Even when John Key was informed that ABC, the largest ECE provider caring for 7000 children, had increased its fees on April 1 he still claimed that cost increases would not affect much of the sector.</p>
<p>“I invite the Prime Minister to visit centres such as the Living and Learning centre in Māngere which is losing $95, 000,” Sue Moroney said.</p>
