<p>Champion of Samoan rights will be missed</p>
<p>The Pacific community are grieving the loss of Wellington based Queen’s Counsel, Dr George Barton, a champion of Pacific rights, says Labour’s Pacific Island spokesperson Su’a William Sio.</p>
<p>“I want to express my sorrow for the death Dr Barton and pay tribute to his courage and sacrifice in supporting Pacific people,” Su’a William Sio said.</p>
<p>“Samoans in particular will remember him fondly for his significant personal contribution when he spoke out against New Zealand’s 1982 Citizenship (Western Samoa) Act.</p>
<p>“That law overrode a Privy Council ruling that gave New Zealand citizenship to Samoans born between 1924 and 1948 when New Zealand still administered Western Samoa.</p>
<p>“He will be remembered as a courageous fighter for the rights of others. He tirelessly fought for the Samoan community, working to right any injustice in the status of Samoan citizenship.</p>
<p>“We will remember Dr Barton as someone who saw everyone as equal before the law and respected all peoples as equals irrespective of colour, race or ethnicity.</p>
<p>“While he was a gentle and dignified person, he was a strong and fierce defender of people’s rights under the law and was not afraid to take on unpopular cases,” Su’a William Sio said.</p>
<p>Dr Barton had gained a doctorate from Cambridge University and had been admitted to the Bar in New Zealand, Sarawak, Sabah, Cook Islands, Niue and Samoa.</p>
<p>“My deepest sympathies and condolences are with Dr Barton’s family at this sad time.</p>
<p>“The Pacific community have lost a strong and dear friend,” Su’a William Sio said.  </p>
