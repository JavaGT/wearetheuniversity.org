<p>Labour List MP in Rotorua</p>
<p>17 May 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Kawerau schools hīkoi reaches Parliament</strong></p>
<p>Kawerau teachers, pupils and community representatives marched on Parliament today calling for consultation on the restructure of their schools. The hīkoi boldly demonstrated that true leadership is walking the talk, says Labour’s list MP based in Rotorua Steve Chadwick.</p>
<p>“I met the hīkoi and support their calls for consultation and transparency of process,” Steve Chadwick said.</p>
<p>“I attempted but was not successful in joining the hīkoi for a meeting with Education Minister Anne Tolley to give the community’s perspective on the restructure process.</p>
<p>“The process around this restructure has been testing for us all. We started out accepting change was inevitable due to falling rolls and concerns with the kids deserving the best education possible.</p>
<p>“Suddenly being told a week ago--- by post--- that three of six schools in Kawerau would be closed was gutless. Now the community has one month to reply to what looks like a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>“I went to an education meeting last Friday in Kawerau where parents and students voiced their concern around the changes and the lack of consultation.</p>
<p>“To close three schools by the stroke of a pen and then not give a direction on whether or not there will be a kura is very concerning.</p>
<p>“The community needs certainty around timeframes, travel needs, classroom capacity and whether or not there could be a staged approach that would be reviewed in two years. That’s the flexibility I requested after my full day visiting pre-schools, schools and parents.</p>
<p>“Community consultation is not rocket science and it won’t impede progress, people have a right to take the driver’s seat in the choices surrounding their children’s education. Anne Tolley has taken the wheel without consulting a local map, and I am anxious that schools will end up on a road to nowhere,” Steve Chadwick said.</p>
