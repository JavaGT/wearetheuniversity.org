<p><strong>Traditional Pacific lifestyle inspiration for healthy living</strong></p>
<p>Pacific Island people can look to the past for ways of reducing health issues arising from unhealthy eating, says a Victoria University PhD graduate.</p>
<p>Dr Aliitasi Su’a-Tavila, who is of Samoan descent, says just 60 years ago Pacific people were among the healthiest in the world as a result of walking, not driving, and eating a diet of mainly vegetables, fruit, fish and water.</p>
<p>She was cooked traditional feasts while carrying out field research in Samoa and says they were markedly different from the menu commonly found at today’s gatherings.</p>
<p>“Western influences have had a big impact and it’s now usual for feasts to include fatty meats, processed food and sugary drinks.</p>
<p>“There is absolutely nothing wrong with traditional Samoan culture. What needs to be addressed is the way it is being practiced,” she says.</p>
<p>Dr Su’a-Tavila says the cultural norms around hosting special occasions and important guests mean a large amount of the best food must be provided.</p>
<p>“Pacific people know what healthy living is about but when it comes to special occasions cultural values dictate that they must provide big quantities of the best.”</p>
<p>She says the real issue is what the best is. “In the old days there was very little cash available in an agricultural economy like Samoa so people ate what they grew or could catch. You still provided the best for your guests at a feast but the menu was based on those natural foods.</p>

<p>“With today’s cash economy, and many Samoans living other places sending money home, people are able to buy food and western influences have impacted on what is now seen as the best.”</p>
<p>Dr Su’a-Tavila says if Pacific people value their health, they should return to a traditional lifestyle.</p>
<p>“That means eating organic food that is fresh, not processed, drinking water and walking as much as possible.”</p>
<p>Dr Su’a-Tavila interviewed 20 paramount chiefs in New Zealand and Samoa during her PhD research and says a key focus has been giving those leaders strategies to influence the amount and type of food provided at special occasions.</p>
<p>“Those chiefs are the most influential people in Pacific communities. In New Zealand you find them in the church which, as a result, has a key role to play in bringing about changes.”</p>
<p>Dr Su’a-Tavila believes being a Pacific Islander allowed her to gain insights that health professionals may not have access to. “Because I live in the culture I have understanding that helps me unpack some of the issues.”</p>
<p>Dr Su’a-Tavila will graduate from Victoria University tomorrow with a PhD in Social Science Research. She is the first person in her family and her church to graduate with a PhD.</p>
<p>She has been studying continuously for the last nine years, gaining four qualifications in that time. They are a Diploma of Social Work and a Bachelor of Social Work from Whitirea in Porirua, and a Master of Arts (Applied) and PhD from Victoria.</p>
