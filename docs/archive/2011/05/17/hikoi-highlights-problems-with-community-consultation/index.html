<p>Kawerau hikoi highlights clear problems with community consultation</p>
<p>A hikoi to save a Bay of Plenty school from closure highlights problems with the consultation process between the Minister and local communities, according to the education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa.</p>
<p>Up to 300 students, parents and community members from Kawerau Intermediate will gather at parliament this morning in a bid to keep the school open. It has been earmarked for closure by the Education Minister who also plans to merge the town’s three primary schools into one, due to dropping rolls.</p>
<p>NZEI President Ian Leckie says during the consultation process the school and its community expressed a strong desire and commitment to keep the school open, but the government has gone with a different option.</p>
<p>“The community would have been very disappointed by that process particularly as it believes the student population has stabilised. It clearly feels very strongly about its school and is speaking up loudly and clearly for the children of Kawerau.”</p>
<p>“Decision can be changed and I hope the Education Minister will at least meet with those involved in today’s hikoi and take a more responsive approach to the issue.”<br>ends  </p>
