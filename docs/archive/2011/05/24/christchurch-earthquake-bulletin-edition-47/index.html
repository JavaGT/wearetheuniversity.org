<p>Christchurch<br>LABOUR MPs</p>
<p>24 May 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Christchurch Earthquake bulletin edition 47</strong></p>
<p>The Labour Party’s Christchurch electorate MPs, <strong>Clayton Cosgrove (Waimakariri), Ruth Dyson (Port Hills), Lianne Dalziel (Christchurch East) and Brendon Burns (Christchurch Central)</strong> have started a regular bulletin to keep people in their electorates and media informed about what is happening at grass roots level.</p>
<p><strong>CLAYTON COSGROVE:</strong> Controversy about so-called celebrity tourism in the red zone is a difficult issue. I can certainly understand the angst if it seems that some people are being let in to have a look around, while others who might have a legitimate reason have to jump through hoops to get permission, or are not allowed. I have no problem with some celebrities being taken through the zone. They have just done a wonderful job raising money for Christchurch through the Telethon, and it was good that they were able to get a real appreciation of the devastation. The case for others visiting at various times has not been quite so apparent, and CERA needs to be aware of conflicting priorities. I am very conscious that there are many Cantabrians who have lost loved family, friends and workmates in the quake, and some understandably and appropriately would like to make private visits to the zone. I would like to think that CERA will consider applications from them sympathetically. There are also many businesses struggling to gain access to retrieve materials and equipment trapped in their premises. These people have real needs. As well as that, some Canterbury people feel upset when people from outside the region can gain access to their ‘place’ when they can’t do so themselves. It is a difficult issue of balance. The bottom line is that when CERA lets someone in, it should be able to show there is a real purpose to the visit. Another day has passed without any advice from the Government about any plan to keep businesses and jobs afloat when the business support package ends next Tuesday. Either it has a plan or it hasn’t. It’s unfair that it is keeping businesses and people on edge. Times are already stressful enough</p>

<p><strong>RUTH DYSON:</strong> Further to last night’s community meeting in Heathcote I have some updates on water issues and flooding. At least 50 houses are suffering damage as the result of flooding. Following discussion with affected constituents local Councillor Yani Johanson and I will work further with EQC and a geologist to determine the cause. Flooding could have resulted because water filtered up through drains, or the water table has changed, or new springs have emerged, or all of the above. The sooner we determine the cause the sooner we can find a timely remedy for families. Overall it was a really good meeting. The community had really grasped the issues they faced and were actively working for resolutions. Those affected by flooding made a presentation to the community board last week, showing the strong community leadership here and the attitude that we will get this done together— without waiting for top-down solutions. I’ve had some more discussions today with constituents concerned about the hard-line approach being taken to people in Christchurch on work permits. Many of them have lost their jobs, and while the priority must be to get as many Cantabrians into jobs as possible, we owe it to those who have made a commitment to our community to honour their time here and get them back into work. These travellers have made a commitment to Christchurch and we need to recognise that their world is also upside down. They have suffered trauma like anyone else and we need to support them where we can.</p>
<p><strong>LIANNE DALZIEL:</strong> I am still concerned at the lack of centralised information about who is still in their homes and what their needs are, if they have left, why they have and if it’s permanently or temporarily. I have written to CERA saying we need to know: how many adults (and their ages); how many children; whether they are employed; whether they have any medical needs and/or disability issues; if they have children at school; whether they are actually safe in their house; any concerns re security etc. We must tap into local knowledge to map each community’s needs to ensure that the individuals who make up those communities are cared for appropriately. We need a database of who is doing what and how long they can continue to offer that help. This needs to be co-ordinated at a local level so that well-meaning organisations can provide their assistance through the local community groups rather than directly into the community. I have also become aware of a project undertaken in Aranui by a number of community groups working with Dr Regan Potangaroa of Unitec which is identifying alarming results on the DASS 42 (Depression, Anxiety &amp; Stress Survey of 42 questions). DASS 42 is a well-established tool to measure the needs within communities in these situations. One of the concerns highlighted has been a high level of anxiety in women aged 40-49 about their families. We need to implement this survey across affected suburbs, and I have suggested that CERA second Regan to oversee this work. In relation to temporary housing, decisions are still being made without consultation with affected communities – for example I have written to the Chief Executive of DBH about the announcement of temporary housing for Rawhiti Domain and its impact on the archery target range. The problem goes even deeper. No-one knows who is going to have to be relocated and when that need will arise. There is time for proper consultation. The eastern suburbs have lost many recreational and sporting locations in the earthquake, so some empathy and respect would go a long way to reassuring people.</p>
<p><strong>BRENDON BURNS:</strong> I am disturbed by news today that Linwood School Principal Margaret Paiti has been forced to ask staff to retire or cut their hours due to budget constraints. Surely we can do better. The Linwood Board had a Commissioner imposed with no notice supposedly because the board wasn’t moving fast enough on relocation and reorganisation of the school. This process is clearly flawed and it is the students who will suffer as a result. Linwood College punches above its weight—it’s a low-decile school achieving great things. Indeed its orchestra recently toured Europe doing us proud. I will contact the college today to get an update. I was pleased to be part of post-Budget legislation last week. It was good to see the Government establish the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Fund to pay for the 60% share of infrastructure and other costs that the state will meet and particularly pleasing to see the establishment of Earthquake Bonds – letting people buy government-underwritten bonds to help rebuilding. What’s still unclear is if money from these bonds might help the private sector fund things like the repair and strengthening of heritage buildings. Note how San Fransisco’s former mayor Art Agnos says that retaining heritage is crucial. It was great to see the bipartisan passage of a bill making it clear that people receiving quake payments from employers and companies donating quake-relief goods were not subject to tax. It’s not often MPs totally agree on something, so it was nice to acknowledge the role of all Canterbury MPs and the generosity of employers and companies. For many days in February I visited CD HQ, filling my car boot with donated goods to take to communities – torches, water, sunblock, facemasks, handwash and toilet paper. As with Rise Up Christchurch, another reminder that we are a generous people.</p>
