<p><strong>Tuesday, 24 May 2011, 5:08 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University">Massey University</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Massey Vet Students Are Barely There…Again</strong></p>
<p>Massey University’s third year veterinary students have revealed all in a calendar to raise funds for their half-way celebration and chosen charity – SPCA Canterbury.</p>
<p>“We are celebrating reaching the half-way point in pursuit of a gruelling veterinary degree,” says vet student, Rosie Keen.</p>
<p>She says the students find a talented photographer (which is never difficult!) to take the pictures and then travel to unique locations, undress and pose artistically with animals.</p>
<p>The combined theme for this year’s calendar is the role of animals in society and the international nature of the third year vet class.</p>
<p>Rosie says “the theme is fitting because this year is World Veterinary Year and celebrates 250 years of the veterinary profession working to improve animal health worldwide. It&#39;s also Rugby World Cup year!”</p>
<p>The photos feature the &#39;Barely There&#39; students with baby chicks at an ostrich farm, elegantly seated on top of a fire engine and sharing a few ‘quiet’ ones next to a large Tui billboard… yeah right.</p>
<p>Ten per cent of money raised from the calendar sales will be donated to SPCA Canterbury - an organisation dedicated to housing animals that are mistreated, abandoned, sick and injured - especially those affected by the Canterbury earthquakes.</p>
<p>She says the donation from the calendar sales will help SPCA Canterbury continue their work protecting the region’s animals from abuse and mistreatment.</p>
<p>It is the sixth year the students have held a fundraiser. The July to June calendars are available for purchase at <a href="http://www.vetcalendar.co.nz">www.vetcalendar.co.nz</a> or from the University’s Palmerston North campus for $15 (inc gst) from 1 June.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Veterinary Association is a major sponsor and supporter of the 2011 Barely There calendar and future young vets.</p>
<p>The calendar’s official launch will be held this Friday.</p>
