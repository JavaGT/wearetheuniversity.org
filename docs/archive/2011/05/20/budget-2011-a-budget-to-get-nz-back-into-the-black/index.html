<p><strong>Budget 2011 – A Budget to get NZ back into the black</strong></p>
<p>May 20, 2011 - The Young Nats raise their glasses to John Key and Bill English on delivering a responsible, balanced Budget that continues to back young New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“Despite what has been challenging times this Government is prepared to make some hard, but fair choices - even in an election year”, says Young Nats President Daniel Fielding.</p>
<p>“Rather than taking a ‘slash and burn’ or a ‘borrow and hope’ approach, this Government is providing the leadership we need to get New Zealand back into the black.”</p>
<p>For Young New Zealanders Budget 2011 affirms National’s commitment to providing a world-class tertiary education system. The Budget provides:</p>
<p>* an increase in the funding rate for degree and post-graduate study;<br>* an increase in funded places at new or high-performing private training establishments;<br>* and a further 40 medical school places.</p>
<p>National has also kept student loans interest free by making changes to encourage greater personal responsibility, ensuring better value for taxpayers and the scheme’s sustainability.</p>
<p>In addition to increases in tertiary education, $66.5 million over four years in new funding has been allocated to the wider Youth Guarantee to keep 16 and 17 year olds engaged in education and training. This will provide up to five new Trades Academies and eight new Service Academies.</p>
<p>“Young New Zealanders are ambitious, not only for themselves but for the whole country. We want to see a country of aspiration not of envy, where success is celebrated and rewarded, not looked down upon.</p>
<p>Only a National Government can deliver this - that’s why on November 26 we will be encouraging all young New Zealanders to vote National”, says Daniel Fielding.</p>
