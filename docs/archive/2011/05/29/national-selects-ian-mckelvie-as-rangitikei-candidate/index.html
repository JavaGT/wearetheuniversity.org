<p>Newly selected Rangitikei candidate Ian McKelvie says he is looking forward to the opportunity of fighting for the privilege to represent the electorate in Parliament.</p>
<p>“This electorate’s had fantastic representation through Simon Power. He’s established a fine reputation as a hard worker and someone who gets things done. We all wish him success and happiness for the future.</p>
<p>“I will devote all my energy to making sure Rangitikei keeps its strong voice in John Key’s Government, because our community and our country needs the growth, the jobs, and the plan that this Government is delivering.</p>
<p>“The sense I get from our community is that they understand the importance of living within our means, and building the critical infrastructure that future proofs New Zealand and our region.</p>
<p>“As we emerge from the recession, and the earthquakes that have hit Canterbury, it has become even more important for our Government to control debt so that we have more choices in the future. We can’t leave young Kiwis picking up pieces from rash promises made in 2011.</p>
