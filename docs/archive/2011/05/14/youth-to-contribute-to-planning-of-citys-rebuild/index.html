<p>Christchurch youth to contribute to planning of city’s rebuild at “Youth Vision 2050” at University of Canterbury</p>
<p>Dozens of young people from around Christchurch are coming together between the 20 and 22 May to participate in Youth Vision 2050. Attendees will take part in workshops, listen to guest speakers and share ideas.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the three-day Youth Vision 2050 event participants will produce a publicly-available document that Louis Brown, Youth Vision 2050 organiser and recognisable as one of the leaders of the Student Volunteer Army, hopes will contribute to “an intergenerational narrative that informs the redesign, planning and rebuild of Christchurch”.</p>
<p>Youth Vision 2050 is limited to 100 participants with those attending receiving a free ticket to TEDxEQCHCH – an internationally renowned and sold out one-day public event being held at the Aurora Centre for the Performing Arts on 21 May to re-imagine Christchurch as a world-leading city.</p>
<p>Young people aged between 13 and 25 can still apply for a free place at Youth Vision 2050 by going to <a href="http://www.youthvision2050.org">http://www.youthvision2050.org</a>. Applications close at 5pm on Monday 16 May.</p>
<p>“It is clear that young people will have a crucial part to play in meeting the challenges facing Christchurch in the coming years,” said University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor, Dr Rod Carr. “Our students have already demonstrated their willingness to offer their energy and commitment to the wider community through their work with the Student Volunteer Army.</p>

<p>“Events such as ‘Youth Vision 2050’ will provide an important forum for young people to be engaged in the planning of the city in which they will live and work as our future young professionals.</p>
<p>“As the Premier Partner for ‘Youth Vision 2050’ the University of Canterbury is proud to show its support to its students, the wider community and the rebuilding of Christchurch.” The UC Student Volunteer Army is also a key collaborator on the event as a Gold Partner.</p>
<p>Youth Vision 2050 is being held in the Jack Mann Auditorium at the University of Canterbury’s Dovedale Campus on Friday, 20 May 1pm-4pm and Sunday, 21 May from 9am to 4pm.</p>
