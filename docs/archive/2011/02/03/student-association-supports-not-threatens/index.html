<h3>“Student Association Supports - Not Threatens”</h3>
<p>The Association supports freedom of expression and does not condone discrimination of any kind.</p>
<p><em>“The Association has in no way, shape or form threatened any action against any student who talks to the media. The counsel given was simply: Should you meet with the media, might I counsel you not do this on university grounds simply because if you bring the University into disrepute, you could face disciplinary action. I advise you to perhaps meet with them (Campbell Live) off campus to avoid any potential issues”, contends Ivy Harper.</em></p>
<p>“As the elected representative and advocate of all students, it would have been remiss of me as President not to give this advice. The tone and delivery was certainly not threatening and this was also reported to Campbell Live although it was cut from the interview”, says Harper.</p>
<p>“As we understand it, there has been a collection of posters put out by the Club including some denigrating God and other religions, which some people have deemed to be offensive. It is standard Association practice that posters are regularly removed as part of a general clean-up at the end of each term. In this instance, the Association did not remove any posters of the Club nor target the Club in any way. Of course, the Association supports the book drive or any initiative that provides support and assistance for any community in need,” notes Harper.</p>
<p>The Association works hard to provide representation and advocacy, events and activities and a number of services as well as actively supporting the many different clubs on campus. Administration support is provided to the clubs and societies as well as other assistance including funding, the use of clubrooms and equipment, fundraising and sponsorship, and photocopying and faxing facilities.</p>
<p><em>“As a multicultural campus we actively support the right for individuals and groups to meet. For the President of the Club to say that she was threatened with a disciplinary panel because of the Club’s beliefs is misleading. What started as posters being removed or defaced by unknown individuals has now turned into a campaign against the Association, the very organisation that has provided financial, administrative assistance and other support to the Club throughout its entire existence”, Harper adds.</em></p>
<p><em>“We have asked to meet with the Club so that we can address its concerns and find a pathway forward to work to ensure tolerance of all views on campus. We sincerely hope the Club will take up the Association’s offer to do so”, Ivy Harper concludes.</em></p>
