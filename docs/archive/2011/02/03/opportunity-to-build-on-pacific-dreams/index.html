<p><strong>Opportunity to build on Pacific dreams</strong></p>
<p>Labour’s Pacific Island Affairs spokesperson Su’a William Sio says his challenge is to build on Pacific peoples’ dreams and aspirations and on the significant contribution they can make in New Zealand and on the world stage.</p>
<p>Su’a William Sio, promoted 12 places yesterday in Labour’s ranking, says that for more than five decades Pacific people have come to New Zealand with “dreams and aspirations for a better quality of life, a brighter future, and for their children to succeed in Aotearoa, the land of the long white cloud.</p>
<p>“Each generation has made significant contributions in a range of ways, including:</p>
<p>o providing a strong workforce, often in jobs no one else wanted to do;<br>o excelling in sport nationally and internationally; and<br>o producing naturally talented musicians and creative artists.</p>
<p>“Pacific people have also been moving forward into the areas of academia, politics and business, but the key to growing this contribution is lifelong education from early childhood to tertiary. It is also about skills development, apprenticeships, economic and community development and financial literacy.</p>
<p>“We must invest in building a strong, healthy and beautiful workforce that is knowledgeable, skilled, smart, intelligent and innovative and can make good quality decisions,” Su’a William Sio said. “That’s why the education and health portfolios are so important.”</p>

<p>Su’a William Sio said he will be working with his colleagues to provide a strong Pacific perspective of Polynesian values in all portfolios.</p>
<p>“My own portfolio isn’t just about Pacific people, but about how to make this a stronger and greater country which recognises diversity, languages, cultures and spirituality as strong values which help build strong families and strong communities. What is good for Pacific people will be good for New Zealand.</p>
<p>“When vulnerable sectors of society feel valued, we strengthen them, and in turn it strengthens us as a country, and we become a better nation for it.</p>
<p>“I’ll be working collaboratively to help build a better New Zealand for the future,” Su’a William Sio said. “I want to take everyone on a journey of achieving a better quality of life, and a brighter future in which our children succeed.”</p>
