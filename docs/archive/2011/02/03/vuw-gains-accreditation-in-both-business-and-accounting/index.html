<p><strong>Thursday, 3 February 2011, 12:32 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Victoria first to gain accreditation in both business and accounting</strong></p>
<p>Victoria is the first university in New Zealand to achieve an internationally recognised accreditation in both business and accounting, joining the ranks of less than one percent of business schools worldwide.</p>
<p>“As the only university in New Zealand and one of just three in Australasia to achieve accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) in both business and accounting, this gives us the edge over other business schools,” says Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of the Faculty of Commerce and Administration, Professor Bob Buckle.</p>
<p>“It reflects the quality and relevance of our programmes, which had to measure up to high international standards. It also means that we have made a commitment to ongoing improvement to ensure that Victoria’s Faculty of Commerce and Administration will continue to deliver high quality education to students.”</p>
<p>Mr John Shewan, Chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers and Chair of the Advisory Board to the Faculty, said that the effects of these accreditations could be far-reaching for the Faculty.</p>
<p>“Gaining accreditation is a rigorous process. When business, government or the professional accounting firms recruit new staff they can be sure that students from an AACSB accredited institution have come through a high quality programme, and thus students with that on their CV have a distinct advantage.</p>
<p>“It will also mean more international students looking to Victoria with the assurance that they will receive a top quality education,” says Mr Shewan.</p>
<p>One of the Faculty’s strengths which the AACSB Board particularly praised was its focus on quality and its connections with the capital city. The AACSB report noted the Faculty’s “strong Advisory Boards, student activities and associated opportunities to engage with the capital city, and faculty endeavours to link their teaching and research interests with those of business and government”.</p>
<p>It also noted that the Faculty had clearly articulated learning goals and objectives and assessment processes which were generally ahead of its AACSB peers.</p>
<p>Professor Buckle said the high praise acknowledged the efforts and commitment of staff in the Faculty.</p>
<p>“Staff have worked incredibly hard to achieve this accreditation. They consistently produce relevant high quality research and deliver outstanding programmes to our students and I thank them for their dedication.”</p>
<p><strong>About AACSB International</strong>Founded in 1916, AACSB International is the longest serving and largest global accrediting body for business schools that offer undergraduate, master’s and doctoral degrees in business and accounting. To realise accounting accreditation, an institution must first earn or maintain AACSB International business accreditation, which requires an institution to undergo a meticulous internal review and evaluation process. In addition to developing and implementing a mission-driven plan to satisfy the 21 business quality standards, accounting accreditation requires the satisfaction of an additional set of 15 standards that are specific to the discipline and profession of accounting.
