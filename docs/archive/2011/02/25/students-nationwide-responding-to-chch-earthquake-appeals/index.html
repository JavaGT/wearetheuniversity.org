<h3>Students nationwide responding to Christchurch earthquake appeals</h3>
<p>Tertiary students are responding to the Christchurch earthquake by opening their hearts and wallets.</p>
<p>Appeals are being launched by students’ associations at universities and polytechnics nationwide during their orientation weeks. These appeals will gather money and goods to assist charities helping with the aftermath of the Christchurch earthquake.</p>
<p>“Our sympathies and thoughts are with the people of Canterbury at this terrible time. Beyond the obvious disruption to students’ studies and jobs, it is particularly distressing to see the huge loss of life and injuries in Christchurch,” says NZUSA co-President Max Hardy.</p>
<p>“We support these association drives – alongside major charity appeals, these are positive initiatives given the major impact this earthquake will have on the region and students there. We also commend the work being done by the Lincoln and Canterbury students’ associations and their respective roopu Te Awhioraki and Te Akatoki in helping the volunteer efforts in Christchurch,” says NZUSA co-President David Do..</p>
<p>“Students’ associations have often played an important role in fostering solidarity and harnessing the energy of students during times of crisis. We hope these appeals will complement the excellent and admirable work of the UCSA Student Volunteer Army. It’s great to see students band together in these times,” says Do.</p>
<p>“We encourage students and members of the public to donate and give generously if they are on campus or to other charity appeals being set up at the moment,” concludes Do.</p>
