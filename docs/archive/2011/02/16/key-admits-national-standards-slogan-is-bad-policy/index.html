<h3>Key admits ‘National Standards’ slogan is bad policy</h3>
<p>Prime Minister John Key has shown himself to be a master of the understatement with his admission of “teething problems” in imposing National Standards on New Zealand schools, says Labour’s Education spokesperson Darren Hughes.</p>
<p>“John Key has finally dropped all pretence that the introduction of National Standards is going smoothly,” Darren Hughes said.</p>
<p>“Education Minister Anne Tolley has presided over what’s become an educational and public relations disaster, and now John Key has given up making excuses for her.</p>
<p>“It is also clear from John Key’s sorry and defensive comments about the programme that he no longer sees the scheme as a vote-winner,” Darren Hughes said. “There won’t be any more boasting. There won’t be any more empty talk about National driving up our educational standards.</p>
<p>“The New Zealand Educational Institute says that John Key’s admission --- that the scheme hasn’t gone as smoothly as planned and that the first year has effectively been a trial --- is a significant victory for the thousands of parents, teachers, principals and academics who have expressed deep concerns.</p>
<p>“The NZEI is not gloating when it says this,” Darren Hughes said. “It’s actually a really sad commentary on National’s political ideology becoming more important in the Government’s eyes than the job of educating our children.</p>
<p>“School children are the real victims of this failed attempt to predict and measure student achievement. At the very least the standards should have been trialled on a small scale. Instead they were imposed holus bolus, and children have been the losers.</p>
<p>“This is just another example of how education has become a mess under National,” Darren Hughes said.</p>
<p>“This was never a proper policy. It was always just a slogan. John Key has finally owned up to what everyone else could see.”</p>
