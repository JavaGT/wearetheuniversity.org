<p>2 February 2011<br><strong>Media Statement</strong></p>
<p><strong>From Beijing to Bavaria, they are buying our farms</strong></p>
<p>A major buy-up of South Island land by European consortiums raises serious questions about the Government’s approach to water and foreign investment issues, says Labour’s water spokesman Brendon Burns.</p>
<p>The Overseas Investment Office has approved German-Swiss investors taking mostly majority stakes in more than 3300 hectares of Southland and Canterbury farmland, Brendon Burns said. One farm, bordering the Rakaia River, is being sold by the now Chinese-dominated Synlait corporate dairy producer.</p>
<p>“That’s indicative of what&#39;s at stake. Synlait started as a New Zealand-owned competitor to Fonterra. A Chinese investor has a majority stake in Synlait’s milk plant at Dunsandel in Canterbury, a township with e-coli in its water supply.</p>
<p>“German investors now have approval to take up to 100% in a supplying farm. Fonterra will remain obliged to collect the milk and argues that is to its cost.</p>
<p>“The new German investors have made clear to the OIO that they expect good returns from their investments,” Brendon Burns said. “In Canterbury, that hinges on getting more water, but we are a country mile away from implementing new environmental controls to improve on the current poor state of our waterways.</p>
<p>“Yet the Government is encouraging a ramp-up in production over more than 1000 hectares of Canterbury farmland, the net benefits of which will flow to foreigners.”</p>

<p>Brendon Burns says while the Government recognised public concerns over the sale of the Crafar farms to the Chinese-based Natural Dairy consortium, the Minister of Agriculture David Carter is welcoming the German investment.</p>
<p>“He’s not prepared to say whether the latest approvals by the OIO just before Christmas would have met the Government’s about-face review on foreign investment in ‘sensitive’ land. This came into effect on January 13.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if investors are from Beijing or Bavaria, Switzerland or Sydney. The concerns are the same --- more demand for water with no new environmental controls, and major questions about whether we should be selling farmland to foreigners.”</p>
