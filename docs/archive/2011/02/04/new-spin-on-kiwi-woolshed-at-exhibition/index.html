<p><strong>New spin on Kiwi woolshed at exhibition</strong></p>
<p>A textile interpretation of woolsheds, what women wear to work and an exploration of the 1960s race to the Moon are some of the themes in the College of Creative Arts Master of Design exhibition, <em>This Way Up</em>, which opens tomorrow.</p>
<p>Textile design postgraduate student Amy Pyle investigated old woolsheds now in various states of disrepair and looked at the shed at Tora Station, Wairarapa, as a particular case study. “I’m using textiles as a way to interpret the woolshed and its immediate environment,” she says. She uses elements of the woolshed, such as corrugated iron and slatted flooring to create textiles reflective of such buildings by laser-cutting, sandblasting and weaving.</p>
<p>Other creative interpretations include the presence of two folding chairs. They are loosely covered with a lambs’ wool padding similar to what Ms Pyle believes shearers used to carry around in their ruck sacks and took out and put on seating as a way “to make their own comfort.”</p>
<p>“These processes have helped to emulate and embody qualities of the decaying woolshed.“</p>
<p>College Research and Postgraduate Studies director Associate Professor Julieanna Preston says the exhibition showcases the design research of 16 postgraduate candidates studying design disciplines including textile, fashion, furniture, performance, digital media, illustration and graphic design. “The works on display represent the culmination of a one year fulltime research project which collectively showcase the research strengths within the Institute of Communication Design and the Institute of Design for Industry and Environment.”</p>

<p>Graphic design postgraduate candidate Claire Hacon sought to redesign the look of the typical women’s business suit, while visual communication design postgraduate candidate Ryan Shields has researched how America’s quest to put a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s was characterised not just by scientific rationalism but also by the lunacy myth which suggests the moon can influence people’s minds.</p>
<p>The exhibition is open in the Museum Building daily from 10am-4pm until next Thursday.</p>
