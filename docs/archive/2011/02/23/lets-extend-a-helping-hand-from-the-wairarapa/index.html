<p>PRESS RELEASE</p>
<p>JOHN HAYES<br>NATIONAL MP FOR WAIRARAPA</p>
<p>23 February 2011</p>
<p>Let’s extend a helping hand from the Wairarapa to those affected by the Christchurch earthquake.</p>
<p>“Thousands of people in the Christchurch area have been badly affected by the latest Christchurch earthquake, and need a break,” said John Hayes MP.</p>
<p>“How about we in the Wairarapa and Central Hawkes Bay extend a hand of friendship and open our homes, batches, farm cottages and motels to those affected by this huge natural disaster. This would allow these shattered people a respite from the constant ground shaking”, said Hayes.</p>
<p>“If you would be prepared to help please phone my office using the toll free number 0800 2 HAYES (0800 2 42937) and let me know what it is that you are able to offer.”</p>
<p>“I will co-ordinate with the Ministry of Social Services to match families with what is available,” Hayes said.</p>
<p>Hayes said he felt sure the people of his electorate will support this action to help those whose lives have been shattered by this terrible event.</p>
<p>“None of us are immune to this sort of environmental disaster,” Hayes said</p>
