<p>Respected Kaumatua appointed to Maori Party Disciplinary/DisputesCommittee to hear complaint against Hone Harawira</p>
<p>Pem Bird, President of The Maori Party has formally announced the pakeke/kaumatua who will fulfil the tikanga role of Whakaruruhau/Tuara/Huruhuru for the Disputes/Disciplinary Committee of five, whose names were released last week.</p>
<p>The pakeke are Dr Patu (Pat) Hohepa of Te Taitokerau ,widely respected and universally acknowledged as a cultural and academic tohunga of the highest standing in Aotearoa and the World Indigenous Community at large and Te Aotuhirangi Hale, kuia of Ngati Manawa and Ngati Pikiao, kuia of nga Kohanga Reo of Southern Mataatua kuia and long time advocate of tribal education and of Kura-a-iwi (tribal schools) and a Justice of the Peace.</p>
<p>&quot;Strenuous efforts were made to try and contact pakeke throughout Aotearoa. Most of those we were able to get hold of were unavailable for one reason or another. We are extremely grateful and relieved however that both Dr Patu Hohepa and Teaotuhirangi were not only available , but were very willing and keen to participate and make a contribution in such a vital role&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Pakeke are a revered group of people in te ao Maori (Maori World) held in the greatest regard and esteem by all, for their wisdom, knowledge and qualities borne of a lifetime of serving the people whether whanau, hapu, iwi or waka, selflessly and with mana. They are steeped in the history, traditions, stories, whakapapa and tikanga of their iwi and occupy that position and play the role of whakaruruhau on their own marae&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The inclusion of pakeke as Whakaruruhau is automatic, a given in all hui contexts, and it is entirely appropriate therefore that positions for pakeke have been reserved for the disciplinary/dispute process. As Whakaruruhau Dr Patu Hohepa and Te Aotuhirangi Hale will lend authenticity to the hearing of the Disciplinary/Dispute committee set down for Wednesday 9 February with the particular function of upholding the integrity of the kaupapa tuku iho (guiding core values) of the Maori Party&quot;.</p>
<p>As Whakaruruhau they will bring their individual and combined attributes to bear on proceedings and guide the hui as necessary to ensure the kaupapa tuku iho ,of wairuatanga (warm spirit) , manaakitanga (mana enhancement) whanaungatanga (respectful relationships) and kaitiakitanga ( custodianship of mauri) amongst others, are fulfilled.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been harshly criticised and condemned in some quarters for following a pakeha legal process at odds with kaupapa Maori I am clear in my own mind however that not only is our constitution kaupapa Maori in word, but crucially in actual implementation, in terms of the complaint we are dealing with. Our earnest and sustained efforts from day one to try and achieve an appropriate kanohi ki te kanohi resolution between Hone Harawira and Te Ururoa Flavell finally came to fruition at Taheke Marae , last week a truly magnificent example of kaupapa tuku iho and tikanga Maori at work&quot;.</p>
<p>Crucially as Whakaruruhau, Dr Patu Hohepa and Teaotuhirangi Hale will have no role to play at all in the judgement process.</p>
<p>&quot;That is clearly a function for the other five members of the Disciplinary/Dispute committee and this is as it should be, in line with tikanga Maori &quot;</p>
<p>A final judgement on the complaint is expected to be in the hands of the National Council of the Maori Party by next Saturday at the latest.</p>
