<h3>Teens and their parents needed for parenting study</h3>
<p>A researcher from The University of Auckland is seeking three hundred parents and their young adolescents to take part in a study comparing the effectiveness of two parenting programmes.</p>
<p>Joanna Chu, a doctoral student from the Triple P-Positive Parenting Research Group, based in the Faculty of Education, is running a six-month study to investigate the acceptability and relevance of two Triple P parenting programmes.</p>
<p>Miss Chu is looking for at least three hundred pre-teens and teenagers aged 12 to 14-years-old and their parents to take part in the large-scale study which is being run in central and west Auckland.</p>
<p>The parents and their teenagers will be randomly divided into three groups of a hundred, one group will complete the Teen Triple P Seminar Series, a series of parenting seminars, the second group will complete the more intensive Group Teen Triple programme and the final will act as a control group.</p>
<p>As part of the study the families will need to complete a series of assessments and questionnaires and those involved in the control group will have an opportunity to complete one of the Triple P parenting programmes for free at a later date.</p>
<p>Miss Chu says the study is important because it is the first time that the Triple P’s teen parenting programmes have been compared.</p>
<p>“Along with extending previous literature on Teen Triple P through its examination of the prevention of drug and alcohol use in early adolescents, the study will provide crucial information regarding the implementation of the two Teen Triple P programmes in New Zealand.”</p>
<p>The internationally recognised parenting programmes have been developed based on 30 years of research. The project is supported by the Auckland Council.</p>
<p>To volunteer for the research project contact Joanna Chu on 09 623 8899 ext. 83042 or email <a href="mailto:jt.chu@auckland.ac.nz">jt.chu@auckland.ac.nz</a><br>For more information on Triple P visit <a href="http://www.education.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/triple-p">http://www.education.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/triple-p</a>.</p>
