<p><strong>Massey to get chair in food material science</strong>  </p>
<p>Dairy co-operative Fonterra and national centre of research excellence the Riddet Institute today announced the establishment of a new Massey University Fonterra Chair in Food Material Science.</p>
<p>Eminent food scientist Dr Peter Munro, a 17-year veteran at the Fonterra Research Centre (and its predecessor the New Zealand Dairy Research Institute), is the first appointment to the new chair. Dr Munro’s was previously a professor of food engineering at the University.</p>
<p>Fonterra chief technology officer Jeremy Hill says Dr Munro’s track record was outstanding. Teams he has led have developed a range of milk protein concentrates, alternate make cheeses and other novel ingredients. “Peter is ideally positioned to lead the ambitious work programme mapped out for this chair in the quest for new and different physical and sensory performance for dairy foods,” Dr Hill says.</p>
<p>Professor Munro will be based at the institute headquarters at the University’s Manawatu campus, where he will lead a research team of post-doctoral fellows and doctoral researchers based in various partner organisations of the institute and its collaborators.</p>
<p>The chair has been funded by Fonterra as part of the seven-year $73 million post-farmgate primary growth partnership announced in August under which Fonterra, the Government, Dairy New Zealand and other industry players are running a $170 million research programme set to drive new value in the dairy industry.</p>

<p>Institute co-director Professor Harjinder Singh says the chair is the first of three to be funded by the PGP partners, with further announcements about the other two chairs and hosting arrangements planned for later this year.</p>
<p>“The appointment of Professor Munro adds further lustre to our world-class capabilities in biomaterials science and digestive physiology,” Professor Singh says. “Under Peter’s leadership, the new chair will apply food materials science to grow new applications for dairy and just as importantly, help develop the next generation of value-creating researchers for New Zealand.”</p>
<p>University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says appointment underscores the institute’s leadership in food science and innovation and the value of the collaborative centre of research excellence model to New Zealand’s industry.</p>
<p>Professor Munro takes up the new position in May.  </p>
