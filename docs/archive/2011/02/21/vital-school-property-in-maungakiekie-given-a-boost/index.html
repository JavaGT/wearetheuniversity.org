<p><strong>Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga</strong><br>MP for Maungakiekie<br>**21 February 2011 Media Statement<br>**</p>
<p>Vital school property in Maungakiekie has been given a $2,169,257.43 boost says Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga MP for Maungakiekie.</p>
<p>“The Government’s Jobs and Growth package means we have new classrooms and a new non-teaching area and much needed building upgrades,” Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
<p>“The Government has spent a total of $2,169,257.43 million upgrading our schools in Maungakiekie This is directly benefiting our students and gives our teachers modern and effective working environments.</p>
<p>“ I was able to see first-hand the considerable investment made in Stanhope Road School at the recent opening of its new facilities,” Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
<p>“We are now spending $200 million a year more on school property than the previous government. This Government is committed to building a quality education system for our children, and I’m pleased we are seeing the benefits of this here in Maungakiekie”.</p>
<p>“Upgrading schools in Maungakiekie has also kept construction firms going at a time when other parts of the market have slowed down. Throughout the country, an additional 2000 jobs have been created because of this building programme.”</p>
<p>Jobs and Growth is the Government’s multi-billion dollar investment to fast-track important construction projects throughout New Zealand. Total spending on schools was $628 million last year and is expected to rise to $741 million over the next year.</p>
