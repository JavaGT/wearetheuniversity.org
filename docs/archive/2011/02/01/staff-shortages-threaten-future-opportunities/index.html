<p><strong>Staff Shortages Threaten Future Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>Universities New Zealand released a report today that shows universities are facing a shortage of academic staff over the next ten years.</p>
<p>“We are concerned about what this might mean for both the quality of teaching offered by universities, and the ability for the next generation to access higher education says NZUSA co-President Max Hardy.</p>
<p>Fewer academic staff will reduce opportunities for quality learning and will put pressure on universities to restrict opportunities.</p>
<p>“We have already seen moves last year by the government and institutions to shut out potential students – something which will mean a great loss of opportunity for those individuals and for New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Universities and Government need to plan now about how they are going to tackle this problem without closing the doors to even more potential students or undermining the quality of the learning opportunities” says Hardy.</p>
<p>“Access to tertiary education is a right and makes a huge contribution to New Zealand’s long-term economic growth. Managing student numbers can not be seen as a viable solution to this problem,” says NZUSA co-President David Do.</p>
<p>“We congratulate universities on thinking long-term - New Zealand needs that foresight matched by a Government which over the past year has only put our future at risk,” concludes Hardy.</p>
<p>Students will also endorse the call for a more collaborative approach to be adopted in the sector.</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.</p>
