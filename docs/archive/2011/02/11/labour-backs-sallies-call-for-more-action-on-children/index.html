<h3>Labour backs Sallies’ call for more action on children</h3>
<p>Labour supports the call by the Salvation Army to put much more emphasis on children’s development and wellbeing, Labour’s deputy leader Annette King says.</p>
<p>The Salvation Army’s fourth state of the nation report released today points to stalled social progress in the past two years, with child poverty levels once again on the rise.</p>
<p>“The report paints a sobering picture of growing numbers of children falling through the cracks – and that is before the huge cuts signalled in this year’s budget. It says the recession is only partly to blame,” Annette King said.</p>
<p>“Labour believes that a much more coordinated approach is needed right across the government and community sector to ensure that New Zealand’s children are front and centre of social policy.</p>
<p>“That is the core philosophy of the new approach Labour is outlining and will take to the election.</p>
<p>“Children’s development and health, particularly in the first six years of their lives, will be made an absolute priority under a Labour government.</p>
<p>“Children will for the first time have a senior minister at the Cabinet table dedicated to putting their interests first, and Labour’s social policy spending will reflect that giving children a great start in life is one of the best investments a country can make.</p>
<p>“The new approach, which I first signalled last September, has been two years in the making and includes input from some of New Zealand’s foremost thinkers and practitioners in child development.</p>

<p>“It will work alongside Labour policies such as making the first $5000 of income tax free and removing gst off fresh fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>“Labour sees its new child-centred policies as unfinished business.</p>
<p>“The policies will build on work the last Labour government undertook, including Working for Families, reducing the cost of visiting a GP, a huge investment in primary healthcare, getting rid of National’s market rents and the creation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs,” Annette King said.</p>
