<p><strong>Government’s answer to quake woes: Hire a PR firm</strong></p>
<p>Nearly six months after the earthquake, the patience and generosity of Canterbury people is almost at an end, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
<p>“Patience has been sorely tested by the Government’s inability to make meaningful, on-the-ground practical progress in the recovery effort for earthquake victims,” Clayton Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“Now the latest response is to instruct the commission to hire a PR firm.</p>
<p>“While I welcome any advance in regional coordination, the announcement by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Commission that it is employing a coordinator, with virtually no resources, doesn’t go far enough,” Clayton Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“Hiring a PR firm won’t convince earthquake victims the Government is doing a good job. And the appointment of a coordinator needs to be backed with a budget and people on the ground in Christchurch not in Wellington, bringing together the plethora of entities and agencies, including councils, in a practical way to work efficiently and swiftly and to avoid duplication.</p>
<p>“Even now it’s not certain what is going to happen.</p>
<p>“What do the people of Canterbury want? They want the big picture. They want a plan. They want a time frame and a pathway toward getting their life back.</p>
<p>“They have been amazingly generous and patient so far. They know there will be delays and changes. All they are asking for is sustained practical progress.</p>
<p>“The Government promised nearly six months ago it would take charge. That’s what Canterbury people need it to do.”</p>
