<p><strong>Thursday, 24 February 2011, 11:23 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato">University of Waikato</a></strong></p>
<h3>How positive practices can make a difference in the workplace</h3>
<p>Optimism, compassion, hope, and gratitude are not typically what come to mind for managers in thinking about strategies for organisational success. But recent studies show that these and other &quot;positive practices&quot; not only enhance workplace wellbeing, but can also help the bottom line.</p>
<p>Waikato Management School’s Professor Ted Zorn is offering a postgraduate paper that focuses on these issues, and says it makes sense that if people are more fulfilled in their work, they’ll be more engaged and committed to the organisation.</p>
<p>&quot;Two international surveys published within the last month show significant effects of these sorts of positive practices on a whole range of organisational effectiveness measures, including staff retention, customer satisfaction and financial performance,&quot; says Professor Zorn, who’s an international authority on management communication.</p>
<p>In the paper he’ll be teaching Professor Zorn won’t just focus on how to get people to work harder. He says he plans to dig deep into what people are really looking for -- what they consider meaningful work and what role that plays in life satisfaction.</p>
<p>&quot;You can&#39;t start with the premise that you&#39;re looking for ways to manipulate people,&quot; he says. &quot;Authenticity is one of the key things people are looking for in meaningful work -- an organisation that they believe is sincerely trying to achieve good things for its people and customers.</p>

<p>“My research on the Best Places to Work competition in New Zealand suggests that some companies struggle with the tension of trying to ‘brand’ themselves as a good place to work and actually changing practices to be a better employer. Staff will see through an inauthentic attempt and may become cynical rather than satisfied.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Zorn’s paper &quot;Meaningful work and workplace wellbeing&quot; is one of a suite of five part-time university papers with a practical focus, aimed at graduates who are already in the workforce.</p>
<p>Each is taught through a two-hour weekly lecture, scheduled for late afternoon or early evening to suit busy working people.</p>
<p>The papers are being offered throughout the year by the Waikato Management School’s Department of Management Communication.</p>
<p>As well as meaningful work and workplace wellbeing, the new papers cover networking, managing virtual team communication, reputation management, and organisational change and communication.</p>
<p>The papers are suitable for those who already have a first degree, and can be credited towards a post-graduate qualification in management communication.</p>
<p>Professor Zorn’s papers on meaningful work and workplace wellbeing and organisational change and communication commence on February 28, and there are still places available. The remaining three papers are being offered in the second semester, starting on July 11.</p>
