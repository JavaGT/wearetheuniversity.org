<h3>Quake accommodation package too little for many --- and too long coming</h3>
<p>After almost six months the Government has failed to put together a robust package to help Canterbury earthquake victims, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
<p>“As far as earthquake victims are concerned, any package is better than nothing, but Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee hasn’t delivered a package that meets the individual needs of victims,” Clayton Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“What victims have ended up with is a cobbled-together, hybrid version of the benefit system.</p>
<p>“A two-person household will get $275 a week, for example, but many such households are actually paying up to $400 a week or more for available accommodation. That’s a considerable shortfall.</p>
<p>“What should have been developed is a package that is tailored as much as possible and flexible enough to meet the individual needs of victims, but this hasn’t happened,” Clayton Cosgrove said. ”What has been developed is a sort of generic three-grade benefit system that won’t meet the real needs of many victims, and will leave them struggling to cope and meet the shortfall in rent.</p>
<p>“The situation for many victims had also been made worse by the Government’s failure to make this announcement earlier,” Clayton Cosgrove said.</p>
<p>“Gerry Brownlee should have announced a package well before Christmas. People have been absolutely stressed out.</p>
<p>”Those people whose temporary accommodation insurance cover runs out after six months have been taken right to the brink. That’s not fair and it’s not right.”</p>
<p>Clayton Cosgrove said the package as designed would create the same sort of age-old arguments that always existed around pensions.</p>
<p>“The costs for a single person receiving $180 a week and a two-person household receiving $275 might well be largely the same. Gerry Brownlee hasn’t taken this into account.”</p>
