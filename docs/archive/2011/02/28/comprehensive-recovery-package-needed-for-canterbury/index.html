<p><strong>Monday, 28 February 2011, 5:59 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Financial Relief a Good Start But Comprehensive Recovery Package Needed for Canterbury</strong></p>
<p>The temporary financial assistance for those caught up in the devastating earthquake is a good start but a comprehensive, flexible recovery package is needed to secure the city’s future, says Labour Leader Phil Goff.</p>
<p>“We’re already seeing true Kiwi spirit and our ‘can do’ attitude at its best with New Zealanders pulling together and looking after each other in this time of crisis.</p>
<p>“The six week wage and job loss support announced by the Government will help ease the immediate pressure on those affected. But what is needed is a cohesive, comprehensive long-term plan that is flexible and can adjust to peoples’ needs as they change from week to week – month to month.</p>
<p>“The first priority is still very much rescue and recovery. Right across Canterbury, a huge number of people are grieving for the loss of friends, family and work colleagues. There are still a large number of people missing and many families are still waiting for the bodies of their loved ones to be brought back to them.</p>
<p>“We also need to look after people’s basic needs – providing power, clean water, a working toilet and money to pay for food and fuel.</p>
<p>“Beyond that though, we need a plan to rebuild this beautiful city and its surrounding areas. We need to develop a robust economy that will support its hundreds of thousands of residents into the future.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders have already shown they have the true grit needed to recover from disasters like the one we’re experiencing in Canterbury.</p>
<p>“In 1931, Napier was rocked by a devastating quake. Hundreds were killed and injured. But a stunning and vibrant city rose very quickly from the rubble through hard work and the sheer determination of all New Zealanders. The same can happen in Canterbury.”</p>
