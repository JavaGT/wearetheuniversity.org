<h3>Gillard should urge Key not to repeat Australia’s failed experiment</h3>
<p>In Australia, voluntary student membership has destroyed meaningful student representation and services on campuses. Students are calling on visiting Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard to urge John Key and his government to not to repeat the same mistake.</p>
<p>Parliament is due to resume consideration of the Act Party’s Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill this Wednesday. National and Act have continued to support the Bill, even though 98% of the over 4800 submissions made to Select Committee were opposed.</p>
<p>“As the academic year starts around the country students are aware that this could be the last year they have a significant voice on their campus. This Bill would silence students’ associations and prevent them from fulfilling their critical role in quality assurance and advocacy. Students should have a say in what happens at their institution and this Bill takes that choice away,” says NZUSA co-President David Do.</p>
<p>There is also mounting concern from students and the tertiary sector over the extra costs this Bill will impose, as well as the loss of student services.</p>
<p>Despite $NZ120m of extra government funding after voluntary membership was passed in late 2005, important students’ association services were devastated in Australia – including welfare, representation, advocacy, clubs and societies, sports, and other aspects of campus life. Students lost their independent voice as many associations collapsed or were taken over by institutions.</p>
<p>“After voluntary membership decimated student representation and services in Australia, many tertiary sector groups and the Government are currently seeking to change the legislation to revive campus life and services, and ensure an independent voice for students,” says NZUSA co-President Max Hardy.</p>
<p>“The quality of tertiary education was compromised in Australia because tertiary institutions were forced to divert funding from teaching and research budgets to sustain services already provided by students’ associations. If the Bill passes here, this will unnecessarily put more pressure on institution budgets and make current underfunding worse,” says Hardy.</p>
<p>An independent economic analysis from PricewaterhouseCoopers on the potential impact of voluntary membership on services provided by students’ associations in New Zealand found that service levels would fall by at least 48 percent and as much as 73 percent under voluntary membership.</p>
<p>“Voluntary membership is damaging and costly to students, institutions, and tertiary education. We urge the Government not to repeat the same mistakes from across the Tasman and instead work with students to retain and enhance student representation and services,” concludes Do.<br>ENDS  </p>
