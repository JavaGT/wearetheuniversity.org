<h3>Teacher Competency Concerns Misplaced</h3>
<p>The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa says maintaining high professional standards is in the interests of all teachers and students, and the number of teachers being referred to the Teachers Council for competency issues is very low.</p>
<p>Of the 95,000 registered teachers in New Zealand there have been 174 teachers referred to the Teachers Council over competency issues in the past five years, and one has been deregistered.</p>
<p>NZEI represents 30,000 registered teachers and says it’s important to keep the issues in perspective.</p>
<p>Teachers undergo annual appraisals within their own schools against professional standards. If competency issues are raised and concerns remain, they are referred to the Teachers Council.</p>
<p>NZEI President Ian Leckie says “we want the best teachers in our classrooms and the public should be assured that in the rare cases where competency is seriously questioned, there are robust systems and processes to deal with it.”</p>
<p>“For teachers too, it’s important that they have a fair system of accountability and one which offers extra support and appropriate professional development,” he says.</p>
<p>“Those who use anecdotal comment on teacher competency are simply scaremongering. Teachers would expect any genuine concerns to be taken up with the school so action can be taken to ensure children’s learning is not compromised.”</p>
<p>“Principals and teachers have a genuine commitment to teaching and learning and have faith in the integrity of their profession and the systems which keep it honest,” Mr Leckie says.</p>
