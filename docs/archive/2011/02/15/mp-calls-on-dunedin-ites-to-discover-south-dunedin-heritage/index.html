<h3><strong>MP calls on Dunedin-ites to Discover South Dunedin Heritage Open Day</strong></h3>
<p>Dunedin South Clare Curran believes many Dunedin-ites, including herself, don’t know about some of the amazing features that lurk in South Dunedin and she challenges all of us to get out and discover them this Saturday.</p>
<p>“Discover South Dunedin Heritage Open Day is going to be one of the biggest events to hit South Dunedin this year and it’s only its first year. For instance did you know that behind the concrete block wall in Braemar St lies the Dunedin Gasworks Museum and a newly restored Fitting Shop Building with a Working steam powered machinery Traction engine?” she said.</p>
<p>“And there is a massive 1915 sanctuary oil painting by Guiseppi Brazi in St Patrick’s Bascilica on Macandrew Road. Also 100 year old statues and terracotta Stations of the Cross.</p>
<p>The first Discover South Dunedin Heritage Open Day which will highlight some of South Dunedin’s best attractions is being held this Saturday 19 February, from the Mayfair Theatre, the Gasworks Museum, St Patricks Basilica to Ocean Beach.<br>“Saturday will be an excellent opportunity for South Dunedin to showcase its best features,” Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>With so many aspects of the area on display, members of the wider Dunedin community will have the chance to discover parts of the city they didn’t know existed.</p>
<p>“It will bring our community together and make Dunedin residents aware of how great South Dunedin really is.</p>
<p>The day is being held from 10am-4pm and is going to be a fun filled day, with a treasure hunt, sausage sizzle, locomotive rides, face painting and much more. It is the first time an event like this has been held in South Dunedin.<br>“The event will enhance our ‘Proud to be South D’ image, and I encourage everyone to come along and see what South Dunedin has to offer” Clare Curran said.</p>
