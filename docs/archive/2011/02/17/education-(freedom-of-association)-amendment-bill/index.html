<h3>Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill : Rahui Katene</h3>
<p>Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill Committee stage: Rahui Katene, Tai Tonga Wednesday 16 February 2011</p>
<p>I rise to take a call on this Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill.</p>
<p>The Maori Party has been greatly concerned about the intention of this Bill, basically ensuring that no tertiary student is required to join a students’ association.</p>
<p>But what we believe is that the underlying purpose of the Bill is to erode students’ associations.</p>
<p>As is of course well known the current system allows students to opt-out of membership, while the Bill proposes that all students be required to opt-in.</p>
<p>The context of this Bill is that student associations and their representatives, including Maori student roopu and their representatives, have often been strong advocates within tertiary institutions and the wider sector, for high quality academic standards, adequate government investment, and for course fee maintenance or reductions.</p>
<p>Students’ associations and roopu have challenged user-pays education since its introduction in 1990, and instead argue that education is a public good and should be funded as such.</p>
<p>But in a healthy democracy, surely we are not about to suggest that having the opportunity to challenge is something we should be afraid of?</p>
<p>The thing is, the current legislative framework is both flexible and inclusive.</p>
<p>It allows for both voluntary and universal membership of students’ associations. This framework also allows students themselves to be the decision makers on whether their association is voluntary or compulsory through transparent democratic referenda.</p>
<p>In short, there has been no wide-spread criticism of the status quo.</p>
<p>In light of all of these criticisms we have drafted up a number of amendments to reinstate the rights relating to effective and meaningful representation to ensure that student voices are heard.</p>
<p>And I want to acknowledge Grant Robertson for his initiative in putting forward amendments which replicated the amendments that we were also proposing We are certainly happy to support the changes, he has put forward.</p>
<p>My own amendments are focused on three key areas.</p>
<p>The amendment to Clause 2: will provide sufficient transition time to minimise disruption to the tertiary sector and services on campus.</p>
<p>If, as we think is inevitable, this Act Party bill is supported by National, then the immediate consequence is that the sector and students will be at significant disadvantage due to the short time window for transition and implementation.</p>
<p>There is a strong case to be made for increasing the lead-in time of the bill to minimise potential disruption. The amendment does not change the intent of the bill.</p>
<p>The second amendment establishes a New section 229CB. Information must be provided by the institution to both prospective and enrolled students about any student association at that institution for the purpose of informing that student of the services provided and how to be a member.</p>
<p>And finally, we seek to create a New section 229CC : The bill as currently drafted places most of the control of student representation and advocacy in the hands of the Tertiary Education Organisation.</p>
<p>Students, a primary funder of student services, will be increasingly forced to shift funding from students associations to Tertiary Education Organisations through student services levy. Students should have the right to effective and meaningful representation to ensure their voices are heard.</p>
<p>Finally I want to thank the New Zealand Union of Students&#39; Associations / Te Roopu Ākonga o ngā Whare Wānanga o Aotearoa for their persistent support and encouragement to do what is right for students.</p>
<p>We share with them, concerns about the negative impact this Bill will have on students, tertiary institutions and the wider sector as services and facilities come under threat and important advocacy and representation on student issues is put at risk.</p>
<p>We hope that these amendments will receive the support of the House, improve the Bill, protect student choice and may better ensure services can continue.</p>
