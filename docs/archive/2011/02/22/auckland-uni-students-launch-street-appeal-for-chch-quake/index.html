<h3>Auckland University students launch street appeal for Christchurch earthquake</h3>
<p>The Auckland University Students’ Association has launched an immediate street appeal to raise money for the people of Christchurch affected by the disastrous earthquake.</p>
<p>“No words can express the horror of the scenes we have seen coming in from Christchurch,” said AUSA President Joe McCrory.</p>
<p>“The street appeal is being co-ordinated by the students’ association and will be running throughout Orientation next week and fresher’s orientation this week,” said McCrory.</p>
<p>Anyone wishing to make a donation to the Auckland University Students’ Appeal for Christchurch may contact AUSA on 09 309 0789, or make a donation in person around the Student Union Building on the University of Auckland campus.</p>
<p>“Thoughts of every University of Auckland student are with the people of Christchurch, their families and friends,” said McCrory.</p>
<p>“Any University of Auckland students who wish to assist the association in organising the appeal are welcome to contact AUSA throughout the next few days,” concluded McCrory.</p>
