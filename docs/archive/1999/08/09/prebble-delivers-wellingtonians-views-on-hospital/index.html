<p><strong>Monday, 9 August 1999, 4:42 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Prebble delivers Wellingtonians&#39; views on hospital site</p>
<p>Wellington Central MP Richard Prebble will carry the weight of public opinion<br>to the Health Ministry this afternoon, as he delivers box-loads of responses to<br>his questionnaire on the site of Wellington&#39;s new hospital. The responses<br>form part of his submission to the Ministry&#39;s &#39;Wellington Hospital Project&#39;,<br>which is weighing up the best site for a future hospital for Wellington.</p>
<p>The majority of respondents (710 out of 727) wanted the hospital at Newtown.</p>
<p>Mr Prebble said the economic effect on Newtown of removing the tertiary<br>hospital would damage employment, housing, service industries and retail.<br>&quot;Over time it would affect the two private hospitals and other specialist<br>health services. It&#39;s unlikely that the medical school would survive if the<br>site of the tertiary hospital was Porirua,&quot; Mr Prebble said.</p>
<p>The Wellington Central MP said the site issue only arose because the Porirua<br>City Council and Porirua Labour MP Graham Kelly wanted to try and get a major<br>employer into their area. &quot;While I can understand their desire to improve the<br>employment prospects for their own patch, that is no way to make health policy<br>for the whole region,&#39; Mr Prebble said.</p>
<p>Mr Prebble said moving the hospital to Kenepuru would put the future of<br>Wellington as a medical centre at risk. &quot;Already, Labour&#39;s interfering has put<br>Wellington in the queue behind Auckland and delayed funding for the<br>Welllington region. This plays right into the hands of those bureaucrats who<br>want to downgrade medical services in the Wellington region.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Prebble said he wanted endorsement for an immediate start to a tertiary<br>hospital at Newtown covering not just existing specialist services but also<br>extending services by better coordination with tertiary hospitals elsewhere.</p>
