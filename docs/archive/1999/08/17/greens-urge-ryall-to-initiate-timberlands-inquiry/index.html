<p><strong>Tuesday, 17 August 1999, 11:13 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Green Party is calling on State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall to initiate an investigation into Timberlands following accusations made today by author Nicky Hager in his new book Secrets and Lies.</p>
<p>Hager&#39;s book reveals how the SOE Timberlands and the public relations company Shandwick have orchestrated a campaign to gain support for native forest logging on the West Coast.</p>
<p>&quot;If Hager&#39;s claims are true then a government-owned organisation has engaged in totally inappropriate behaviour,&quot; Mr Donald said.</p>
<p>&quot;The lobbying, the manipulation, and activities which verge on the subversive are what you would expect of a trans-national corporation, not a state-owned enterprise. It is vital that Mr Ryall sets up an independent inquiry to carry out a thorough investigation of these extremely serious allegations.</p>
<p>&quot;The timing is crucial as Parliament is currently considering legislation which would allow Timberlands to rip out thousands more trees from pristine native forest and permit the export of native woodchips.</p>
<p>&quot;The Shandwick revelations also bring into question the integrity of Timberland&#39;s claims about the sustainability of their proposed beech scheme,&quot; he said.  </p>
