<p><strong>Tuesday, 17 August 1999, 4:53 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Winston Peters latest attempt to rewrite history is outrageous even by his standards, says ACT Leader Richard Prebble.</p>
<p>&quot;For the last 12 months he&#39;s been trying to convince us that he wasn&#39;t our Treasurer for two years and he didn&#39;t destroy thousands of jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;Ms Rankin was appointed while Winston Peters was Treasurer. She was NZ First&#39;s personal choice.</p>
<p>&quot;NZ First insisted on a new upmarket head of department and Winston Peters authorised the creation of the position, the huge pay - a quarter of a million dollars -and the glitzy budget.</p>
<p>&quot;Now he has the nerve to claim that he was somewhere else when all these things happened.</p>
<p>&quot;Cabinet papers show all these decision were approved by him and he took the lead in pushing them through Cabinet and on the country,&quot; Mr Prebble said.  </p>
