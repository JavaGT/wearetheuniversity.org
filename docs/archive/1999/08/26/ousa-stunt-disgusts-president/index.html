<p>Press Release<br>For Immediate Release</p>
<p>26 August 1999</p>
<p>OUSA stunt disgusts President</p>
<p>National&#39;s Youth Vice President Daniel Gordon was disgusted to hear about the stunt carried out by Otago University Students&#39; Association.</p>
<p>Paper mache heads of 51 politicians faced a &#39;firing squad&#39; on campus today, with those politicians found &#39;guilty&#39; then blown up. Association president Steven Day claims it takes 51 years for a female graduate to pay off her student loan.</p>
<p>&quot;What a lot of rubbish. Where on earth did he pluck this figure from? I challenge Mr Day to show us his calculations,&quot; said Daniel Gordon.</p>
<p>Daniel Gordon said the loans policy is working well, ensuring all students have access to education. There are about 40% more people in tertiary education than in 1991 and the growth in Maori and Pacific Island participation has been astounding.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour may be promising to give students interest free loans, but Mr Day and the likes, must the consider the real consequences of this. Overall it will actually increase the amount being borrowed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Those students who don&#39;t need student loans will be able to borrow the money, put it in the bank and collect the interest. Labour&#39;s policy is unfair and is a gift to well-off students and families.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel Gordon pointed out that the Government pays for nearly three-quarters of students&#39; fees and the education budget continues to increase dramatically each year.</p>
<p>&quot;We must keep such stunts in perspective. Out of our seven universities, NZUSA has only three full financial members. Such stunts represent the view of a rapidly diminishing minority.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he can&#39;t understand why Labour is not getting slammed for their lack of new ideas and commitment towards education in the lead up to the election.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s going around the country promising nothing, but reviews. The reality is they do not want to change the status quo. They know they can do no more for education.&quot;</p>
