<p><strong>Wednesday, 18 August 1999, 12:36 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.labour.org.nz"><img src="http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg" alt="Labour
2000 web site"></a>Labour Leader Helen Clark said today that the National Party&#39;s Bright Future policy was a joke and little more than an exercise in hand-wringing at a time when the New Zealand economy needs leadership and action from government.</p>
<p>&quot;National does nothing to address the single most important barrier to the creation of a knowledge-based economy: the student loan problem and the brain drain. Young graduates are being driven out of New Zealand by the burden of their student debt.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead, after nine years of ignoring the systemic failure of the New Zealand economy, what we have is a blatant National Party election campaign exercise masquerading as a government policy initiative.</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs Shipley and the National Party have indulged in a hugely expensive public relations exercise - funded by the taxpayer - to announce just over $10 million a year of new funding. It was a launch containing no vision, no coherent strategy and very little substance.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, yet another committee has been established to look at compliance costs for small businesses. A select committee last year published a series of recommendations on how to tackle compliance costs. Instead of setting up another review, those recommendations could have been adopted.</p>
<p>&quot;The money pledged is pitiful. National has shuffled some resources and come up with just over $10 million a year of new money and some new committees. It is little more than an exercise in hand-wringing when what New Zealand needs is a government prepared to lead and work with business, the education and research sectors, and the regions to drive a new economy,&quot; Helen Clark said.</p>
