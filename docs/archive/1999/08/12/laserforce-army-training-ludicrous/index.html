<p>Media Release</p>
<p>12 August 1999</p>
<p>&quot;LASERFORCE&quot; ARMY TRAINING LUDICROUS</p>
<p>New Zealand First Defence Spokesperson, Major (rtd) Ron Mark, has condemned the banning of live-fire training exercises as a &quot;gigantic leap backwards&quot; for our Army.</p>
<p>Mr Mark was responding to an Army decision to stop using live ammunition during training exercises, and replacing it with electronic simulator packs.</p>
<p>&quot;Playing laser-strike and space invaders does not condition troops for war&quot;, said Mr Mark.</p>
<p>&quot;In no way does this simulate the dangers of carrying a loaded weapon. Nor does it teach our soldiers how to run, duck, weave, and engage using live ammunition in a combat situation. It comes down to a soldier&#39;s ability to operate effectively under fire.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot have troops who are so ill-trained that the first time they experience carrying live ammunition is when they are sent into action.</p>
<p>&quot;This does nothing for soldiers&#39; combat ability and will cost lives&quot;, said Mr Mark.</p>
<p>&quot;Junior commanders and NCOs are right to worry about the safety and preparedness of their soldiers. There is no substitute for live-fire training.</p>
<p>&quot;No amount of academic rationalisation by the General - who lives in Wellington - will ever change that. If Major-General Dodson feels he needs to have the need for live-fire training explained to him, then he is clearly unsuited to be Chief of Army General Staff.</p>
<p>&quot;War is an ugly business. It takes no notice of Occupational Safety and Health regulations. Men need to train accordingly.&quot;</p>
