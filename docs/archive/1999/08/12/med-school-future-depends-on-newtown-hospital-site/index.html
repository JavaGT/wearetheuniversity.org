<p>SPEECH TO WELLINGTON SCHOOL OF MEDICINE SURGICAL RESEARCH TRUST.</p>
<p>Takahe Room Plaza International Hotel, Wellington 5.30pm Thurs 12 August<br>Hon Richard Prebble CBE<br>Leader ACT New Zealand, MP Wellington Central</p>
<p>Future of Wellington Medical School depends on new hospital being at Newtown</p>
<p>As Member of Parliament for Wellington Central, I am honoured that the<br>Wellington School of Medicine Surgical Research Trust has asked me to be your<br>guest speaker at the Trust&#39;s annual dinner.</p>
<p>It gives me an opportunity to say three things. Firstly, why New Zealand<br>medical research is important and secondly, why private sector involvement is<br>vital and thirdly, why having a medical school in Wellington is important to my<br>constituents.</p>
<p>New Zealand is a small country with less population than the city of Sydney.<br>Medical research is very expensive. Many research projects turn out to be<br>blind alleys. Why not decide that research is for large prosperous countries<br>and just concentrate on say lowering waiting lists?</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why abandoning our own research would be a very<br>bad idea. Let me give just one. The medical problems that different nations<br>face are very different. If we lived in the Solomon Islands where the malaria<br>rate in Honiara is 108% each year - some unfortunates catch it twice in a<br>year - then malaria would be our medical number one priority.</p>
<p>New Zealand has medical challenges that are unique to our country. No one else<br>is going to study us and if we don&#39;t, then the problems will get worse. Let<br>me illustrate by taking just one of the projects that the Trust is supporting -<br>prostate cancer research. Let me quote from the summary of the research<br>project.</p>

<p>&quot;Prostate cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death in New Zealand<br>men. The death rate from prostate cancer has been steadily increasing over the<br>last 30 years, so that the mortality among New Zealand men is now fifth<br>highest in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>The research summary goes on to say:</p>
<p>&quot;In New Zealand we are seriously hampered by lack of any accurate knowledge of<br>how common the problem really is. We have a multicultural society and yet<br>there is no data relating to Maori, Polynesian or men of other ethnic<br>backgrounds. Of great interest is that globally it is believed that prostate<br>cancer is commoner in blacks and in men with a diet high in animal fat and low<br>in yellow/green vegetables. In New Zealand we do not know what the<br>predisposing factors (if any) are.</p>
<p>The aims of this study are as follows:</p>
<p>ž To determine the incidence of prostate cancer in men with specific reference<br>to men of Maori and Polynesian descent.<br>ž To determine whether race (ethnic group) is a significant risk factor.<br>ž To determine the importance of family history.<br>ž To determine whether there are any other risk factors such as diet, previous<br>infections of the prostate, environment and so on.&quot;</p>
<p>If we don&#39;t do that research no one else will. Why not say that this research<br>is so good that the taxpayer should fund it all?</p>
<p>Because the demand on the public purse will always exceed the money available.<br>This is my second point. Experience has taught us that the quality of<br>outcomes from projects that have a significant private contribution are<br>significantly higher than those purely funded by the taxpayer.</p>
<p>There is a very good reason for this. Public projects become political.<br>Politicians cannot help themselves - they want to get re-elected.</p>
<p>Our example is a good one. Prostate cancer, I understand, kills more than<br>breast cancer. Perhaps it&#39;s because women are more sensible than men -<br>breast cancer is debated and there is wide public understanding.</p>
<p>I did not realise, until I was reading this backgrounder, that New Zealand is<br>now fifth in the world for prostate deaths. I get many letters and lobbying<br>for breast cancer funding - which I support. I can&#39;t recall ever getting<br>lobbied for research into prostate cancer.</p>
<p>If the private sector does not support this research - the chances of purely<br>taxpayer funded politicised research funding for such a project is remote. So<br>you are meeting a real need.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my third point, why having a medical school in Wellington is<br>such an asset to the region.</p>
<p>I spoke to Form 1 &amp; 2 pupils from St Teresa&#39;s school in Karori this morning.<br>The class is doing a project on the resources available to Wellington and<br>Wellington&#39;s role in the economy.</p>
<p>Of course we discussed the economic effects of being the capital, the effects<br>of being also the cultural capital, of becoming a tourism centre and my<br>campaign to attract new corporates to Wellington.</p>
<p>I pointed out to the students that one advantage Wellington has over Auckland<br>is this city is a centre of educational excellence. A good university,<br>polytechnic and good schools attract corporates to locate here.</p>
<p>So too with medicine. To get a world class tertiary hospital for Wellington<br>means we need to attract top professionals and the medical school is an<br>important attraction.</p>
<p>The medical school being at Newtown is a vital part of the cluster of medical<br>excellence in that suburb. It&#39;s one of the reasons why Newtown is the only<br>site for a tertiary hospital.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t have a medical school in Newtown and the tertiary hospital in<br>Porirua.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that should the tertiary hospital be built in Porirua,<br>Wellington&#39;s medical school won&#39;t be able to get funding to move to Porirua and<br>will not survive as a separate facility for very long.</p>
<p>Medical politics being what it is, there are some who are promoting Kenepuru<br>because they know that such a development will lead to many tertiary services<br>and our medical school being relocated to another city.</p>
<p>I have no doubt Wellington would be the loser, along with our reputation as a<br>centre of educational excellence. So as MP for Wellington Central, this is a<br>battle I am determined not to lose.  </p>
