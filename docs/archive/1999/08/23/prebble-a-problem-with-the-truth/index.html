<p><strong>Monday, 23 August 1999, 5:06 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.labour.org.nz"><img src="http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg" alt="Labour 2000 web site"></a><br>ACT leader Richard Prebble has lost the plot on who has done what on Wellington Hospital, Labour health spokesperson Annette King said today.</p>
<p>&quot;His latest tirade demonstrates he is still suffering from his long-term condition - terminological inexactitude.</p>
<p>&quot;Firstly; there has never been a Labour-inspired proposal to shift the main hospital to Kenepuru. The only MP who has ever mentioned going to a completely different site is Richard Prebble, at the first meeting of Wellington MPs to discuss an upgrading of A&amp;E.</p>
<p>&quot;He was the one who suggested a Greenfield site.</p>
<p>&quot;Secondly; Graham Kelly is not the principal parliamentary promoter of a Labour plan. Graham Kelly along with other Wellington region MPs including United&#39;s Peter Dunne have worked together to secure a tertiary hospital for Wellington. This followed the former Minister of Health&#39;s statement that he did not envisage Wellington as one of the future sites for a tertiary hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;Thirdly; to suggest I have never spoken out over Wellington hospital shows a serious loss of memory by Mr Prebble. He should replay the Channel 7 TV interview, where we appeared together, from just two weeks ago.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve had a gutsful of the ACT leader&#39;s grandstanding on this issue,&quot; Annette King said. &quot;He did nothing until the hospital was shifted into his electorate by boundary changes. Up until then it was left to me to co-ordinate a regional effort to secure the hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time that Richard Prebble grew up and stopped playing the little boy who has to tell whoppers to get attention.&quot;</p>
