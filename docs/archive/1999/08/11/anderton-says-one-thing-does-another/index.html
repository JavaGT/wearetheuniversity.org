<p><strong>Wednesday, 11 August 1999, 9:51 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National Ilam MP Gerry Brownlee today described Jim Anderton as being “hopelessly confused” when it comes to monopolies.</p>
<p>Mr Brownlee was responding to Alliance’s criticism that the Government doesn’t restrain Telecom’s monopoly enough.</p>
<p>“Just recently Alliance portrayed itself as a supporter of monopolies, through its failure to support Government legislation to regulate monopoly electricity lines companies.”</p>
<p>He asked the Alliance Party leader to come out and say which monopolies he supports and which ones he doesn’t. He said Alliance is obsessed with knocking Telecom only because it is an easy itch to scratch.</p>
<p>“Only two weeks ago we saw Mr Anderton being highly critical of the status and practices of the communications company.”</p>
<p>Mr Brownlee said Anderton and his spokespeople can shout all they want about monopolies, but by actively supporting electricity lines monopolies, Alliance has denied hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders the cheaper electricity prices they deserve.</p>
