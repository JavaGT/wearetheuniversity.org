<p><strong>Tuesday, 31 August 1999, 10:36 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT Leader Richard Prebble, one of the few MPs in Parliament to have personally known Norman Kirk, has accused Labour President Bob Harvey of whipping up anti-American feelings on the eve of APEC, with his absurd claim that the CIA murdered Norman Kirk.</p>
<p>&quot;Norman Kirk was strongly in favour of ANZUS and New Zealand&#39;s alliance with America,&quot; Mr Prebble said. &quot;Norman Kirk would not have agreed with the New Zealand Labour party&#39;s present foreign policy. I know, because Norman and I frequently discussed and argued about the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;Bob Harvey&#39;s remarks are a deeply offensive reflection on Norman Kirk&#39;s doctors. There was never any suggestion that there was any doubt about the reasons for Norman&#39;s illness or death.</p>
<p>&quot;He caught a gastric illness when visiting Bangladesh in the 1960s, as have thousands of others. Does Bob Harvey claim the CIA poisoned them all? Norman at the time wasn&#39;t Prime Minister, and there&#39;s no reason to suppose that the CIA would have had the slightest interest in him.</p>
<p>&quot;So the question needs to be asked, why is Bob Harvey the president of a party that hopes to be government within three months publicly asking our Prime Minister to insult the US by asking, &quot;Did you murder one of our Prime Ministers?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know Labour is concerned that APEC may be a triumph for Jenny Shipley but that&#39;s no excuse for Mr Harvey&#39;s behaviour.</p>
<p>&quot;I also find it offensive that people now claim after Norman Kirk&#39;s death to have been his confidants when a reading of the Kirk diaries published by his former secretary Margaret Hayward shows these claims are bogus.&quot;</p>
