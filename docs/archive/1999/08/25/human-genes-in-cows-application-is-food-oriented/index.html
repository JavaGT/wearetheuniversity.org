<p><strong>Wednesday, 25 August 1999, 10:15 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>A hearing in Wellington today in which government agency AgResearch is applying to put human genes into dairy cattle is food-oriented, despite publicity about medical benefits, Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said today.</p>
<p>&quot;AgResearch has carried out a major public relations exercise pointing out that its application to the Environmental Risk Management Authority (ERMA) could lead to a breakthrough in finding a cure for multiple sclerosis,&quot; Ms Fitzsimons said. &quot;I hope this is correct as it is a dreadful disease and any way of finding a cure, including genetic engineering, should be looked at positively.&quot;</p>
<p>However the detailed application by AgResearch was targetted more towards nutritional changes, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s not a lot in today&#39;s application details that give multiple sclerosis sufferers cause for great hope,&quot; Ms Fitzsimons said. &quot;But there&#39;s a lot about changing food values of milk, especially so as to make cow&#39;s milk more like human breast milk. AgResearch needs to explain why it is doing this.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons said the idea needed a wider public debate, with ethical considerations argued as well as today&#39;s strictly scientific ERMA hearing.</p>
<p>&quot;Putting human DNA into cows is a highly contentious act. But there is no plan for any official ethical debate about this at all. ERMA is charged with looking at scientifically-assessed environmental risks only.</p>
<p>&quot;The hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars which have already gone into this human-genes-in-cows research needs to be evaluated also. Are taxpayers getting value for money when people around the world are turning off these transgenic products?&quot; Ms Fitzsimons said.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand desperately needs a Royal commission of enquiry into genetic engineering rather than lurching from one application to another with only narrow scientific debate, and little public reassurance.&quot;</p>
