<p><strong>Monday, 16 August 1999, 9:41 am</strong><br><strong>Speech: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>(An Address to a Public Meeting, Senior Citizen’s Hall, Storey Place, TAUPO)</p>
<p>There’s an old saying that a week is a long time in politics.</p>
<p>A year can be an eternity. Exactly one year ago today the first MMP coalition government split up.</p>
<p>Many in the Beehive were in a state of shock and, on the surface, New Zealand appeared to be in political turmoil.</p>
<p>Many political careers were on the line – especially mine.</p>
<p>This new party, from Heartland New Zealand, which had gone from being just an idea to government in three years was, our critics said, in ruins.</p>
<p>New Zealand First, in the perception of nearly every journalist and political commentator, was finished.</p>
<p>That was one year ago.</p>
<p>How times change.</p>
<p>Many of these same people who said a year ago that we were finished, now want me to discuss New Zealand First’s place at the centre of New Zealand politics.</p>
<p>I shall not be wasting my or your time doing that.</p>
<p>The only people not surprised at what is happening are the people in provincial New Zealand, and those in New Zealand First itself.</p>
<p>We always knew it was only a matter of time before people realised that New Zealand First was actually the prudent and sensible partner in the coalition, and that our policies worked!</p>
<p>What these self opinionated experts failed to understand, was that we were in a new political era, and that there were always going to be a few hiccups with MMP.</p>
<p>A political system can’t be changed overnight and be expected to function perfectly the next day.</p>

<p>When we arrived in the coalition government we soon found that the “system” was still geared to First Past the Post.</p>
<p>For example, at the start it was hard to get access to the full range of Cabinet papers.</p>
<p>It was only because I was Treasurer (and held the cheque book) that we gained access to much of the appropriate information.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister had a big staff and access to the general flow of information while we, in New Zealand First, were treated in many ways like another Opposition party.</p>
<p>It was the same in the House. The whole seating plan did not acknowledge MMP.</p>
<p>It was difficult for many of our inexperienced MPs.</p>
<p>On one side of the House sat Labour, devastated and bitter that it could not be the government – despite, their worst result since 1928, gaining only 27 per cent of the vote.</p>
<p>On the other side sat arrogant National MPs, who think power sharing is an electricity bill for a student flat!</p>
<p>Gradually we managed to push through important measures.</p>
<p>We scrapped the super surtax,<br>we got free medical care for the under sixes,<br>we funded thirty thousand more operations at public hospitals,<br>we increased education spending dramatically,<br>we lowered interest rates and the exchange rate,<br>we put more police on the streets to fight crime.</p>
<p>However, we always realised that at some stage, an issue would arise that we and National would not agree on.</p>
<p>Enter Mrs Shipley – who became Prime Minister – to get rid of New Zealand First and engineer the break up of the coalition.</p>
<p>National simply could not tolerate any of the checks and balances that are necessary within government.</p>
<p>Some critics of MMP say that when smaller parties go into coalition with bigger parties, it becomes a case of the tail wagging the dog.</p>
<p>This is not true. It is more a case of the dog being kept on a leash, restrained from chasing cats, worrying sheep and biting passers-by.</p>
<p>Democracy is not a perfect system of government, but we, as a nation, have always believed that it is better than any other system.</p>
<p>Thousands of New Zealanders, who died on battlefields in far off places, shared this belief.</p>
<p>In his address at Gettysburg, President Abraham Lincoln described it as “Government of the people, by the people, for the people.”</p>
<p>And that is what New Zealanders want. That is why they voted for MMP in the first place.</p>
<p>They don’t want backroom deals between political parties and politicians deciding the outcome of the election, before the election is even held.</p>
<p>They want politicians who will share power with the people.</p>
<p>That’s why we are not aligning ourselves with either Labour or National.</p>
<p>We will talk to them after the election, when the voters have decided on the shape of the new Parliament, and not before, when nothing has been decided.</p>
<p>We now have experience in MMP and the transition to the next government will be a lot smoother than the last.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems with minority single party rule is that it is basically corrupt with the bureaucracy and vested interests running the government.</p>
<p>That is what is happening now.</p>
<p>This is why Wellington has been hit by a series of bureaucratic scandals.</p>
<p>We’ve had the Tourism Board fiasco, the Fire Service scandal, a computer budget blowout in at least six government departments, and an uncontrollable department called WINZ. That is just a short list of weekly disasters.</p>
<p>The time has come for the people of New Zealand to take their country back from bungling bureaucrats and weak politicians.</p>
<p>New Zealanders want leadership they can trust.</p>
<p>They want leaders who will admit that they are human and can make mistakes.</p>
<p>They want leaders who will concentrate on the real issues affecting New Zealand.</p>
<p>They want leaders who will take them into their confidence.</p>
<p>And they want leaders who value people as people, and care about what happens to them.</p>
<p>This is probably the worst outcome of the failed economic experiment of the past fifteen years – the loss of our traditional values.</p>
<p>We were once a kind and caring people. We valued our young and our old.</p>
<p>We did not believe that the rich and powerful should seize our natural resources.</p>
<p>We did not want taxpayer owned assets flogged off to foreign owners.</p>
<p>We want New Zealand back!</p>
<p>We want the government cleaned up.</p>
<p>We want our young people to be educated and trained without student loans bankrupting the family .</p>
<p>We want our public health system to treat us when we are sick.</p>
<p>We want our government to restore our national super, so we do not spend our remaining years on the breadline.</p>
<p>We want jobs for everyone willing and able to work, and we want to be safe in our homes and on the streets.</p>
<p>Effective law and order is a fundamental principle of a civilised state.</p>
<p>The government has a duty to protect its citizens – especially those unable to defend themselves.</p>
<p>One of New Zealand First’s achievements in the coalition government was to put an extra 500 police on the streets to fight crime.</p>
<p>Now, we have police numbers being reduced, police officers being forced to leave crime scenes to reapply for their own jobs, and police districts being changed without consultation.</p>
<p>In short, front line police are being prevented from fighting crime by a bunch of hand wringers in police headquarters with a dysfunctional computer system.</p>
<p>Recently a family had to leave Invercargill because a gang moved next door.</p>
<p>The father gave evidence at the trial of a gang leader, and for performing this civic duty, this man had to take his family and run because the gang swore it would take revenge on him.</p>
<p>We have a message for criminal gangs.</p>
<p>New Zealand First is going to transform them into work gangs.</p>
<p>They are not going to earn their so-called “patches” by committing crimes.</p>
<p>They are going to earn their keep by doing an honest day’s work under a New Zealand First “Tough Love” policy .<br>It costs about sixty thousand dollars a year to keep someone in jail.</p>
<p>We believe that this money would be better spent setting up work camps where offenders who are not a physical threat to society could be gainfully employed under strict supervision.</p>
<p>Offenders would have a healthy outdoor life with plenty of physical activity, free of drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p>They would be fitted with electronic bracelets and all their activities would be closely monitored.</p>
<p>They would learn the work ethic, and those prepared to be rehabilitated would be given some training to acquire new skills, so they did not slip back into a life of crime on release.</p>
<p>The present system is not working. Our jails are a training ground for criminals.</p>
<p>We are at a critical stage in New Zealand Politics.</p>
<p>As the public are becoming more and more understanding of the realities of coalition government, and the need for a modifying centrist influence, they are once again turning against the old parties – and their minority attempts to dominate and control everything.</p>
<p>The public are to be congratulated and I am certain this public understanding of how MMP works is going to grow and threaten the two old parties and the establishment.</p>
<p>There are hundreds and thousands of forgotten New Zealanders who get a say now under MMP – who never had a say in the past.</p>
<p>New Zealand First learned from our differences with National not being made clear enough while we were in government.</p>
<p>Consequently, any future government that we are a part of will be more open and transparent – the differences between the parties publicly known and understood – for the public have a right to know.</p>
<p>MMP is different from First Past the Post.</p>
<p>The public have to see those differences, see the increased representation, see the modifying influence and see the social conscience at work.</p>
<p>The critical issues for this election in 1999 are these:</p>
<p>Integrity;</p>
<p>Trust;</p>
<p>A track record of keeping political promises and;</p>
<p>Making MMP work for the people.</p>
<p>New Zealand First is on the way back because people know that we never reneged on a promise, and we delivered - even our harshest critics admit that.</p>
<p>We had our principles and we stuck to them.</p>
<p>We are again being attacked because we won’t join the power blocs and take part in their power games.</p>
<p>We are here for the people’s interest.</p>
<p>We are the only party which can look voters in the eye and say we keep our word.</p>
<p>None of the others can do that.  </p>
