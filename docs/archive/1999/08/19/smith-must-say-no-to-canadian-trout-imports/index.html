<p><strong>Thursday, 19 August 1999, 2:37 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.labour.org.nz"><img src="http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg" alt="Labour

<p>Parliament&#39;s Transport and Environment Committee has recommended that Mr Burton&#39;s Conservation (Protection of Trout as a Non-Commercial Species) Bill should pass into law. The bill would ban commercial sale of trout in New Zealand, protecting it as a recreation-only species.</p>
<p>The Government imposed a temporary ban on trout imports last year while Parliament considered Mark Burton&#39;s bill. The Minister of Conservation is able to approve exemptions to the ban and a Canadian company has applied for permission to import.</p>
<p>&quot;The select committee included MPs from all sides of the House, with only Act opposing the bill. Nick Smith should remember that when he makes his decision.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Claims from the Canadians and Federated Farmers that international trade agreements require the minister to approve the application don&#39;t stand up. New Zealand has a right to protect its unique lifestyle and natural resources and most of Parliament clearly believes it should. So do thousands of anglers and other Kiwis.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Parliament might not have time to pass my bill this year. In the meantime Nick Smith has a moral obligation to give our trout fishery the protection Parliament and the public want.&quot;  </p>
