<p><strong>Thursday, 23 September 1999, 3:30 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students&#39; Association today welcomed news that Dr Norman Kingsbury would become Chief Executive of the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) as &quot;a positive step for tertiary education quality and students&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Kingsbury has an outstanding knowledge and level of expertise in education quality matters,&quot; said NZUSA Co-President Karen Skinner. &quot;He also has considerable management experience, and is keenly aware of student issues and concerns.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The New Zealand Qualifications Authority has a vital role to play in maintaining and improving quality in tertiary education, particularly in an environment where resources are very stretched and the temptations to cut quality corners are increasing,&quot; continued Ms Skinner. &quot;The poor leadership of NZQA over the past few years has therefore been a source of considerable concern to us. We are very happy to see someone of such talent - and one of our alumni - take over this important position, and we wish him the best.&quot;  </p>
