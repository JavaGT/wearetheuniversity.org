<p><strong>Wednesday, 22 September 1999, 2:00 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT Leader Richard Prebble said he was pleased to see Karla Cardno&#39;s killer has been deprived parole.</p>
<p>&quot;But the public should realise that at the same time, the Parole Board is granting parole wholesale to offenders who&#39;ve served only a third of their sentence. Parole is an experiment that has failed. From questions I&#39;ve asked in Parliament I can reveal that 45% of early parole prisoners reoffend within a year, and more than 73% within three years.</p>
<p>&quot;None of this seems to make any difference to the Parole Board. I&#39;m afraid I believe this particular Parole Board decision has been influenced by the fact that this is a high profile case which the public is scrutinising. Less publicised offenders who have raped, bashed, maimed and terrorised are being granted parole every week.</p>
<p>&quot;The parole board should be abolished. We should have a Truth in Sentencing law requiring all offenders to serve at least 80% of their sentence.</p>
<p>&quot;Early release should be administered solely by the prison service who are likely to be tougher, and only granted for exemplary behaviour in prison.</p>
<p>&quot;Under my Truth in Sentencing proposal most offenders will serve their full sentence - which is exactly what the judge ordered and the public expects.&quot;</p>
