<p>Thousands of injured people will miss out on ACC cover unless the Government moves immediately to amend the law, Labour ACC spokesperson Ruth Dyson warned today.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister of ACC Murray McCully changed the definition of personal injury by accident, and now a District Court ruling has declared that non-impact injuries are not covered by ACC.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a dramatic change in the way the definition has been interpreted over many years.</p>
<p>&quot;It will encourage people to lie about the cause of their injury, or risk not being covered.</p>
<p>&quot;Already serious anomalies are arising,&quot; Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>&quot;A farmer strained his neck when he jerked his head suddenly to avoid being kicked by a cow. He&#39;s been denied ACC cover because there was no external force. If the cow had kicked him, he would be covered.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be many similar instances of unfair exclusion. If you hurt your back bending to pick something up, you won&#39;t be covered - but you will get ACC if the back strain occurs when standing up again with the object in your grasp.</p>
<p>&quot;A rugby player hurt in a tackle will be covered - but what if they pull a hamstring while sprinting for the goalline?</p>
<p>&quot;Labour extends its support to the Government for a small amendment to ACC legislation to be passed in the last week of Parliament,&quot; Ruth Dyson said.</p>
<p>&quot;The original intention of the law must be restored.&quot;</p>
