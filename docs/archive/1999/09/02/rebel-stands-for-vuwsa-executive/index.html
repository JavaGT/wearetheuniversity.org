<p><strong>Thursday, 2 September 1999, 9:51 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels">Prebble&#39;s Rebels</a></strong></p>
<p>Victoria University Prebble’s Rebels President, Nick Archer, has today announced that he will be standing in the upcoming elections for the Victoria University of Wellington Student Association (VUWSA) executive.</p>
<p>Nick Archer said &quot;the VUWSA executive is out of control - they are using student money to bankroll fringe left-wing causes which are not in the interests of a majority of students.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that by electing a Prebble’s Rebels member, students will be sending a message to the socialists that students want a more moderate governing body.&quot;</p>
<p>Nick Archer questions why extremist student elements such as the Education Action Group are guaranteed student funding from VUWSA while other cultural and sports clubs are made to undergo an application procedure. Mr Archer also asks why these applications are not exposed to the scrutiny of the students who provide the bulk of VUWSA’s money.</p>
<p>The Otago branch of Prebble’s Rebels regularly stands candidates for their Student Association executive, and Otago Rebel President Clint Heine endorsed Nick Archer, saying &quot;Nick would make an excellent member of the VUWSA Executive, and I urge Victoria students to consider whether they really want the socialist left to continue wasting their money or whether they would rather vote for accountability.&quot;</p>
<p>Clint Heine said &quot;if Victoria students want to vote for a moderating voice on the VUWSA executive then they should tick Nick.&quot;</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
