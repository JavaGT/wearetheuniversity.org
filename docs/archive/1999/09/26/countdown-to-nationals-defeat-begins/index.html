<p><strong>Sunday, 26 September 1999, 4:19 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.labour.org.nz"><img src="http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg" alt="Labour

<p>&quot;The Government led by National has been a shambles since soon after the 1997 election. Only the self-interest of the rag-tag mob of defectors has kept the Government in place until the bitter end of this three-year term.</p>
<p>&quot;National is out of date, out of touch and out of time. Its self-proclaimed reputation as an economic manager is in tatters. Friday&#39;s dismal GDP figure, showing the economy in recession in the June quarter, put paid to any hopes National had of running on its record.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour fully expects that National&#39;s campaign will be based on lies, smears and fears, because it has nothing positive to promote or defend.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s campaign in contrast will be positive. New Zealanders have high hopes for the future. Only a change of government and a new direction for New Zealand can deliver on those hopes.</p>
<p>&quot;We know the world can&#39;t be changed overnight, but we also know that change must begin to rebuild a more prosperous and fairer society.</p>
<p>&quot;Our pledges to New Zealand are set out in the commitment card I launched in May. Those commitments place as our top priorities: creating jobs, through more support for industry and business growth; lowering the cost to students of tertiary education; putting patients before profits and reducing waiting times for surgery; reversing National&#39;s 1999 superannuation cuts and building a fund to secure the future of New Zealand Superannuation; restoring income-related rents for state housing so that low-income tenants pay no more than 25% of their household income in rent; cracking down on burglary; and guaranteeing no increases in GST, company tax, or in personal or impersonal income tax for the 95% of New Zealanders earning under $60,000 a year.</p>
<p>&quot;For too many years now New Zealand has followed a failed model of economic and social policy. That model has run its course. It&#39;s time for a change that puts the public interest first.</p>
<p>&quot;While a small number of New Zealanders on high incomes have prospered, middle income households have been squeezed hard and poor New Zealanders subsist as best they can.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s vision is to see a more dynamic economy boosting the living standards of all New Zealanders and sustaining top quality public services in areas like health and education. We want New Zealanders to have a quality of life, environmentally and culturally, that is unparalleled anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>&quot;The choice before New Zealanders is clear: a fresh start on rebuilding a strong economy and fair society, or a continuation of the shambles of the last three years and the unfairness of the last nine.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s upbeat campaign offering hope for the future will be in stark contrast to National&#39;s deathbed defence of its appalling record.&quot;  </p>
