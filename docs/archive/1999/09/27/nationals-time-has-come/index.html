<p><strong>Monday, 27 September 1999, 12:22 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>&quot;NZUSA welcomes the election date announcement and we can’t wait for a chance to vote this government out&quot; said Karen Skinner Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA). &quot;We have no-confidence in Max Bradford as Minister of Tertiary Education or Jenny Shipley and her cabinet to lead this country.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our education system is in a complete mess due to the incompetence of this National government&quot; said Ms Skinner. &quot;During their term in government they have done nothing but decrease the quality of our degrees, force students into unsustainable debt and make Tertiary education accessible only to the rich. This government has been disastrous for students and the bright future package just more of the same. For these reasons we will be encouraging students to vote out National.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear that tax will be an election issues, and one that we are not afraid to tackle. Nationals’ user-pays education is a tax which disadvantages the poor. A progressive taxation policy allows the redistribution of wealth to ensure that everyone has the right to food, shelter, healthcare an d education.</p>
<p>&quot;This election is the last chance to salvage what is left of our education system&quot; concluded Ms Skinner.</p>
