<p><strong>Sunday, 12 September 1999, 11:14 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels">Prebble&#39;s Rebels</a></strong></p>
<p>Prebble&#39;s Rebels New Zealand President, Clint Heine, today congratulated Richard Prebble on his speech to students at Canterbury University on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Prebble says that &#39;others can&#39;t exercise your choice for you&#39;, and this for many students will be a central issue at this year&#39;s election&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>
<p>&quot;Students recognise that they are faced with a choice between a Government of the left, which will strangle the economy and punish graduates for their learning with higher taxes, and a Government of National and ACT, which will allow students to take control of their own lives and make real decisions about their future.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Rebels agree with Mr Prebble when he says that &#39;you are not free to choose, if the state is going to take 40% of all you earn&#39;. Nanny State is gorging herself at taxpayers&#39; expense, and the only way for students to ensure that they are studying in a country which will reward them for their effort is if they vote to put Nanny on a diet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Students want the right to choose the direction of their own life - and they will use their votes to win back the right to make our own choices and to take responsability for those choices&quot; Clint Heine said.</p>
