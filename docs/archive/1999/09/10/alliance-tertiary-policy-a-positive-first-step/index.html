<p><strong>Friday, 10 September 1999, 9:10 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>&quot;Alliances&#39; initial Tertiary policy release today is a positive first step&quot; said Karen Skinner, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA). &quot;It is good to see a party acknowledging that a generation of debt has been created, and needs to be dealt with.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The level of student debt and the student loan scheme has clearly become a key election issue. We are pleased to see a party willing to commit to real change in this area.</p>
<p>&quot;The social impact of the student loan scheme has been of great concern to NZUSA since its introduction. We are pleased that Alliance has come out and acknowledged the negative impact that growing debt has on society.&quot; Ms Skinner</p>
<p>&quot;Only through initiatives announced today will New Zealand truly create the knowledge base that we need as a society. Tertiary Education is fundamental to our society and economy - which means that government needs to invest in it.  </p>
