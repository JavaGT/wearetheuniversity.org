<p><strong>Thursday, 30 September 1999, 4:58 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Green Party Health spokesperson and Wellington Central list candidate Sue<br>Kedgley says commonsense has prevailed in the Government&#39;s decision to keep<br>Wellington&#39;s major tertiary hospital in Newtown.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes far better sense to have a hospital in the heart of a city, where<br>most Wellingtonians can reach it easily, than in an outer suburban area of<br>the city,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It also makes sense to locate it near to an already existing infrastructure<br>of health care services. The cost of having to relocate these facilities<br>would have been prohibitive, and would have made no sense at all,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision is good news for Wellington city, and especially for Newtown,<br>which would have suffered a huge dislocation if the hospital and surrounding<br>businesses had been forced to move away from it.&quot;</p>
<p>The Greens also welcomed the decision to upgrade facilities at Keneperu.</p>
<p>&quot;This decision will meet many of the concerns of residents from Porirua and<br>surrounding areas,&quot; Ms Kedgley said.</p>
