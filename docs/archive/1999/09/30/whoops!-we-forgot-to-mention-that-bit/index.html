<p><strong>Thursday, 30 September 1999, 8:09 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour’s “interest free” student loan policy is not all that it seems says Belinda Vernon MP for Maungakiekie.</p>
<p>“Labour has chosen its words carefully when describing its fairer repayment system,” says Ms Vernon. “It pays to read the fine print.”</p>
<p>“Labour says that ‘no interest’ will be charged on loans to full-time and other low-income students while they are studying.</p>
<p>“But when talking about how much interest will be charged once a student stops studying the words vary subtly but importantly.</p>
<p>“Labour says that for those earning between $14,716 and $25,000 no “base interest” will be charged. And for those earning between $25,000 and $30,000 “base interest” will be progressively applied.</p>
<p>“The difference between “interest” and “base interest” will be lost on most people. But when it comes to student loans the difference is important.</p>
<p>“As students know the interest rate charged on a student loan is made up of two parts: the base interest rate and the interest adjustment rate.</p>
<p>“The interest adjustment rate reflects the movement in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of the preceding year. It is effectively an inflation adjustment.</p>
<p>“Clearly Labour intends to charge the interest adjustment rate or inflation component as soon as students leave the tertiary institution. But it isn’t prepared to say so!”</p>
<p>“Students should not be taken in by thinking that interest will only accrue once they earn over $25,000. This is clearly not the case. An inflation adjustment component will kick in as soon as they stop studying.”</p>
<p>“Labour’s policy is not what it seems,” concluded Ms Vernon. “Students, beware of Labour bearing gifts.”</p>
