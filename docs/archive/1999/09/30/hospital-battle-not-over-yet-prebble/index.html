<p><strong>Thursday, 30 September 1999, 1:58 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>The announcement by the Minister of Health Hon Wyatt Creech of a new tertiary hospital for Wellington at Newtown is wonderful news but the battle&#39;s not over, says Wellington Central MP Richard Prebble.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour and the Alliance have never endorsed Newtown as the only sensible site for a tertiary hospital. Indeed, the Labour-inspired proposal to build a new hospital in Porirua has only achieved an 18 month delay. More seriously, the delay has put Wellington hospital behind Auckland in the queue.</p>
<p>&quot;As MP for Wellington Central I do not accept the delay until the year 2003 before the hospital is opened. I do appreciate that a tertiary hospital is a very complex development requiring very careful planning and that hospitals take time to build. However Newtown is already zoned for a hospital. We already know the general outline of what&#39;s needed and I believe that with energy and commitment the hospital should be ready a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;What we now need is for the Labour MPs to come out prior to the election with a strong commitment to stop their bickering over the site and accept what the health professionals, the independent experts and the public have been saying all along - that Newtown is the only logical site.</p>
<p>&quot;If they do that, then I will agree not to point out to the public that I am the only MP who was willing to point out that the Graham Kelly/Bill English proposal to build a tertiary hospital away from the medical school, the oncology unit, the blood bank, and the other hospital facilities was a completely silly idea.</p>

<p>&quot;As it is, I do think this announcement of a new hospital at Newtown is a practical demonstration of why Wellington needs a effective local representation. Pleased as I am with this decision, it should have been made a decade ago. It is an indictment on both major parties that the main hospital in the capital should be in a third world condition.</p>
<p>&quot;Having said that, it&#39;s a great decision Wyatt, and you&#39;re showing real promise,&quot; Mr Prebble said.</p>
<p>ENDS  </p>
