<p>As MP for Rongotai I am pleased with the decision to build a new Tertiary Hospital at the Newtown site in Wellington but a number of concerns remain, Annette King said today.</p>
<p>&quot;This was an issue that saw most Wellington regional MPs working together and displaying a cross-party commitment to ensure the region retained a tertiary facility.</p>
<p>&quot;The one exception was Richard Prebble who as usual resorted to grandstanding and making false claims.</p>
<p>&quot;Wyatt Creech has now announced a decision in favour of Newtown. What hasn&#39;t been revealed is how the estimated $160 million cost will be met, or who will run the new tertiary facility. The failure to provide detail smacks of hasty decisions to boost National&#39;s election chances rather than the considered process that was initially agreed to.</p>
<p>&quot;A tertiary hospital is not the only initiative that needs to be taken to meet the health needs of the Wellington region,&quot; Annette King said.</p>
<p>&quot;There needs to be a long-term commitment to three secondary hospitals in the Wellington region: Hutt, Kenepuru and Newtown. Wellington needs three centres to ensure public access to services.</p>
<p>&quot;The risk of earthquakes is one obvious reason why emergency services must operate from more than one site. The decision to establish a 24 hour Accident and Emergency facility at Kenepuru is a sensible one. But I am concerned National believes it can wait three years before opening the facility 24 hours a day and doesn&#39;t appear to be providing adequate back-up services.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s announcement on health services in the Wellington region is a start. But we need more information before the people of the region can be assured that their needs are being properly met,&quot; Annette King said.</p>
