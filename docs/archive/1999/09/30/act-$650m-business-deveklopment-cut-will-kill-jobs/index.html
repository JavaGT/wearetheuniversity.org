<p><strong>Thursday, 30 September 1999, 4:37 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Act&#39;s $650 million cut to business development will destroy thousands of jobs</p>
<p>Act&#39;s proposed vicious cut of $650 million in business assistance will destroy thousands of jobs and is flying in the face of Japan and Taiwan&#39;s proven path to creating a knowledge based economy.</p>
<p>&#39;Roger Douglas&#39;s tax cuts in the mid 80&#39;s destroyed 60,000 jobs. Now he wants to destroy another 60,000 by cutting government funding to industry by $650 million,&#39; Alliance Leader Jim Anderton said</p>
<p>&#39;These figures come from the Employers Federation own research which revealed Act&#39;s hidden agenda to slash at least $1250 million from government expenditure in the next two years.</p>
<p>&#39;These cuts include a $150 million cut to agricultural based industries at the same time that Act claims it has been rural New Zealand&#39;s most dependable voice in parliament.</p>
<p>&#39;Will Act never learn? Government has a vital role to play in partnership with industry to develop new job-rich, high technology industries.</p>
<p>&#39;Alliance policies will create 80,000 jobs by implementing the same policies that have revitalised countries like Ireland and Finland.</p>
<p>&#39;The Taiwanese computer industry sprang from a government plan to build a knowledge economy. This was helped with direct assistance in the way we are suggesting our Economic Development fund will work.</p>
<p>&#39;None of these economies were built on Act style slash and burn free market ideology.</p>
<p>&#39;Act&#39;s proposed tax cuts for the rich will just add to the balance of payments crisis and New Zealand&#39;s foreign debt because those on high incomes are more like to buy more expensive luxury imports rather then spend money creating jobs.</p>
<p>&#39;Roger Douglas assumes any public money spent on helping industry by government actually costs jobs. Countries such as Taiwan disprove that theory&#39;, Jim Anderton said.</p>
<p>Act&#39;s planned spending cuts are on page 44 of the Employers Federation report &#39;Assessment of political party tax policies 1999&#39; which was hailed by Act as &#39;a major independent study&#39; on Monday.</p>
