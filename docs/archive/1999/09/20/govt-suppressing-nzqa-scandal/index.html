<p><strong>Monday, 20 September 1999, 3:30 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.labour.org.nz"><img src="http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg" alt="Labour

<p>Trevor Mallard said Tertiary Education Minister Max Bradford was holding onto a report which was called for following controversy surrounding former chief executive Douglas Blackmur.</p>
<p>&quot;The findings in the report will reinforce public perception of this Government&#39;s acceptance of outrageous spending of taxpayers&#39; money in areas like travel and entertaining,&quot; Trevor Mallard said.</p>
<p>&quot;In June, Mr Bradford sought to extinguish public disapproval by announcing reviews of NZQA when questions that I asked were about to bring public attention to some unsavoury practices.</p>
<p>&quot;He wanted to appear to be pro-active in opposing excessive spending which he knows the public has had enough of.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet, I am aware that he has had the results of those reviews for some time now and is choosing to keep them hidden. He is suppressing information that the public has a right to know.</p>
<p>&quot;In light of vehement public opposition to the salary and expenses enjoyed by outgoing Lotteries Commission chief executive David Bale, his caution is understandable, but it is entirely unacceptable.</p>
<p>&quot;I call on Mr Bradford to make those reports public,&quot; Trevor Mallard said.  </p>
