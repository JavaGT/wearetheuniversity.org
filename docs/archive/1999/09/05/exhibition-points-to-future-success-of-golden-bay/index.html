<p>A Golden Bay artists&#39; exhibition at Wellington&#39;s Michael Fowler Centre this week is a pointer to the region&#39;s future success, says Green MP Rod Donald.</p>
<p>Art from about 50 Golden Bay artists goes on display from 7-11 September in the MFC&#39;s Fletcher Challenge Foyer. Mr Donald hosts the event on Tuesday, 7 September from 5.30pm -7.30pm, with guest speaker well-known mountaineer Peter Hillary.</p>
<p>Mr Donald said the exhibition was an exciting initiative which showed the beauty of the region.</p>
<p>&quot;The economic future of Golden Bay rests heavily on its growing reputation for inspirational art, its remote and expansive beaches, unobstructed seascape, and native bush and natural heritage.</p>
<p>&quot;This exhibition is a positive step towards helping that future vision take root.&quot;</p>
<p>The exhibition is organised by the Friends of Golden Bay Society in conjunction with Victoria University&#39;s Tourism and Services Management Programme.</p>
<p>Green Party West Coast Tasman candidate Richard Davies said the society had been active in opposing the extension of marine farming in the bay - excluding it from within three nautical miles of beaches - but the exhibition showed the society was not anti-business.</p>
<p>&quot;We don&#39;t oppose marine farming, but the society is determined to find a balance between those activities that exploit the environment and businesses, such as art and tourism, that depend on keeping it in its natural state.&quot;</p>
<p>The Friends of Golden Bay Society&#39;s approach to commercial development in the area was very much in line with Green Party policy, Mr Davies said.  </p>
