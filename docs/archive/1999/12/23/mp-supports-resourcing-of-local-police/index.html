<p>MP Supports Resourcing of Local Police</p>
<p>Clayton Cosgrove Member of Parliament for Waimakariri said that he was pleased that Canterbury Police would receive 10 new front-line vehicles as part of the national fleet replacement programme as announced today.</p>
<p>“I’m pleased that the Minister of Police George Hawkins has supported the purchase of these vehicles. I have been lobbying him since before the election when he visited my electorate of Waimakariri, for the need to better resource local Police.</p>
<p>“The new vehicles will see new specialist and patrol vehicles replace many of the department’s ageing fleet. Police in Canterbury put their lives on the line every day and they should be provided with the necessary equipment to do their job.”</p>
<p>Mr Cosgrove said that whilst he supported the vehicle purchase, this was only a first step in giving local Police the resources they need to fight crime effectively.</p>
<p>“I have invited the Minister of Police to revisit the Kaiapoi Police Station with the Commissioner of Police in the New Year, so that the Commissioner can see first hand the appalling conditions in which the officers and staff at Kaiapoi are currently working.”</p>
<p>“I said before the election, that Kaiapoi needs a new Police station. I will continue to fight for this,” Mr Cosgrove said.</p>
