<p><strong>Thursday, 23 December 1999, 10:47 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) was today disappointed with the response from the Minister of State Services to a parliamentary question from the Green Party relating to the accessibility of Community Wage - (Student) over the summer break</p>
<p>In response to Green Party co-leader Rod Donald&#39;s question in the house today Stave Maharey again refused students universal access to the Community Wage (student) instead stating that Labour would continue with its investigation into the feasibility of a wage subsidy scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has already taken swift action in addressing student loan interest rates, and we have acknowledged and welcomed this&quot; said Tanja Schutz Co-President of NZUSA. &quot;However we feel that the reinstatement of Community Wage Student over the summer break is equally important, and as such we are encouraging the Minister of State Services to address this urgently&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that even under a Labour lead government students will be forced to go to foodbanks&quot; said Karen Skinner Co-President of NZUSA. &quot;The Greens and Alliance appear to be willing to address this issue, its time for Labour to follow suit&quot;.</p>
