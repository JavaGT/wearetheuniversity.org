<p><strong>Wednesday, 8 December 1999, 11:07 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Young_Nationals">New Zealand Young Nationals</a></strong></p>
<p>Beneficiaries around the country are reeling today after the Labour/Alliance Government confirmed they will cut benefits by $20 a week before Christmas.</p>
<p>The shock move was condemmed by Young Nationals Chairman Daniel Gordon today. &quot;After National&#39;s changes to superannuation this year, Labour and Alliance described it as a &#39;cut&#39; because the increase in super was less than previously expected. Therefore, using their own definition, the new Government has cut benefits by $20 a week by not accepting the Alliance&#39;s proposed increase.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Gordon said he stunned by the cruelty of the new Government.</p>
<p>&quot;This is blatant beneficiary-bashing,&quot; raged Mr Gordon. &quot;Helen Clark has stolen Christmas for thousands of families. I wonder how she can sleep at night, knowing what she has done.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the worst Government we&#39;ve had in years,&quot; concluded Mr Gordon.  </p>
