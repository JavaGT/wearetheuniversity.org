<p><strong>Sunday, 5 December 1999, 1:38 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The people of Darfield shouldn&#39;t have to suffer Christchurch&#39;s rubbish dumped on their doorstep because of successive governments&#39; inaction on waste reduction, says the Green Party.</p>
<p>Green co-leader Rod Donald is today attending a picnic organised by the Dump the Dump committee at the site of the proposed Darfield superdump. Local MP Jenny Shipley is also expected to attend.</p>
<p>&quot;The only way we will stop superdumps, such as the ones proposed for Darfield and on the banks of the Waikato River, is for the government to adopt a nationwide &#39;zero waste&#39; strategy,&quot; Mr Donald said.</p>
<p>The Greens are calling on all parties to work together to tackle the growing waste problem.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m even happy to work with local Rakaia MP Jenny Shipley on this issue providing she embraces zero waste rather than proposes simply shifting the dump onto someone else&#39;s doorstep,&quot; Mr Donald said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Malvern hills are as precious to the people of Darfield as Hagley Park is to Christchurch residents and no-one in their right mind would dump the city&#39;s rubbish in the middle of the park.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the new government will provide strong leadership to achieve zero waste and work in partnership with local government, business and the community.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of the day, success will only come from a change in behaviour and attitude towards resources and the environment, in addition to appropriate Government incentives and penalties.&quot;</p>
<p>The Greens support: a shift of taxation away from incomes and onto waste and pollution, promoting venture capital for new Cleaner Production technologies, implementing true cost accounting, encouraging a cradle-to-grave life cycle production model, and making manufacturers and packagers responsible for the costs of the final disposal of their products, said Mr Donald. &quot;A &#39;zero waste&#39; strategy has the added benefit of removing the uncertainty and anxiety from the lives of those people living near the proposed rubbish dumps,&quot; he said.</p>
