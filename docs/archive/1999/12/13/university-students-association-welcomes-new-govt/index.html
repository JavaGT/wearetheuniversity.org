<p><strong>Monday, 13 December 1999, 10:11 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) is welcoming the change of government and looking forward to working with an administration that puts the needs of students, staff and the community ahead of cost cutting exercises and rationalisation.</p>
<p>“Now that the final results are out and the Cabinet positions announced we know with whom we will be working over the next three years to implement positive change in tertiary education. Labour, the Alliance and the Green party all have student friendly policies and we are certain that they will work cooperatively together to achieve a better learning envrionment for students,“ said NZUSA Co-President Elect Sam Huggard.</p>
<p>“The tertiary education sector is in a state of crisis and urgent work needs to be done to address spiraling student debt, rising fees, the absence of universal living allowances and student poverty.”</p>
<p>“The situation of many students is concerning. Already two students associations are running food banks over summer to cope with the student poverty that has been brought about by nine years of an unfriendly and unfair government. We look forward to a change of direction,” concluded Sam Huggard.</p>
