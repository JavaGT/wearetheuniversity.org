<p>Tuesday 21st Dec 1999<br>Gerry Eckhoff<br>Media Release -- Other</p>
<p>Central Otago based MP Gerry Eckhoff said today he was surprised that Government members who have been parading through the flood-stricken town of Alexandra making promises could not find time to send the issue to a select committee for action.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to me they are only interested in helping the town if they can gain political advantage from their tragedy,&quot; Mr Eckhoff said.</p>
<p>Mr Eckhoff was denied leave to make a Notice of Motion which would have instructed the Commerce select committee to hold an enquiry into the &quot;causes, severity and frequency of flooding in Alexandra&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard told the ACT Leader that the new Government was opposed to an enquiry because it would show a liability of Contact Energy of at least $20 million. Mr Prebble replied that Labour had not opposed the INCIS enquiry even though it had exposed a liability, so why not allow an enquiry to find out whether Contact Energy had a liability to the people of Alexandra?</p>
<p>&quot;Roxburgh dam has brought benefits to the nation over a long period of time,&quot; he said. &quot;It will be a tragedy if this has been bought at the expense of Alexandra&#39;s future.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Eckhoff said he was determined to have a select committee enquiry and that he would try again.</p>
