<p><strong>Tuesday, 21 December 1999, 9:07 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) are pleased that the new Government has upheld it’s commitment to tertiary education by abolishing interest on student loans for full time, full year students and low income earners early next year.</p>
<p>This is a positive step in the right direction, however the calls for lifting access restrictions to Community Wage - (Student) (formerly Emergency Unemployment Benefit) are still being ignored.</p>
<p>&quot;Students are relieved that this Government has taken some action towards alleviating the student debt time bomb&quot; said Tanja Schutz, Co President NZUSA. &quot;We have been waiting, after nine years of a National led government that did nothing for tertiary education, except develop and endorse those barriers which impeded access and participation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are still however deeply concerned that student access to the Community Wage – (Student) has not been addressed.&quot; said Karen Skinner, Co President NZUSA. &quot;Currently, many students are without work and receive no income support from their families.&quot;</p>
<p>Present policy states that students who receive an allowance during term time are eligible for the Community Wage - (Student) if they cannot find summer employment. Those receiving a student allowance total only 36% of full time, full year students.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking forward to working with this coalition Government in the coming year to address many of the other tertiary education issues&quot; concluded Ms Schutz  </p>
