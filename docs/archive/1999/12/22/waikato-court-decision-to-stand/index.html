<p>Media release - for immediate release</p>
<p>Waikato Court decision to stand</p>
<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) has welcomed Waikato University Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould&#39;s decision to abandon his appeal against the High Court decision, which struck down his proposed restructuring of parts of the University.</p>
<p>&quot;The Association was always confident that the judgment was legally correct and that the Vice-Chancellor did not have the managerial powers he claimed. We are pleased that Professor Gould has now accepted that&quot;, said AUS National President, Professor Jane Kelsey.</p>
<p>&quot;Staff concerns about managerial excesses are not confined to Waikato and this case had resonance throughout the country. At Victoria University, similar criticism was a significant factor in the resignation of the Vice-Chancellor Professor Irving, announced yesterday. Problems exist at most other New Zealand universities.</p>
<p>&quot;Professor Gould&#39;s decision is a timely recognition that current university management practices will have to change. The Government has made it plain that market-driven competition is to end and that universities are to return to their traditional functions and values.</p>
<p>&quot;The AUS welcomes that shift, and will work hard to ensure that the Vice-Chancellors implement the necessary changes. We will work constructively and positively with them towards that end,&quot; said Professor Kelsey.</p>
<p>Professor Kelsey can be contacted on 021 680 475</p>
