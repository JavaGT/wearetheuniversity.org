<p><strong>Wednesday, 22 December 1999, 3:41 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Green MP Sue Bradford is calling for urgent assistance for unemployed students over Christmas and for the rest of the summer.</p>
<p>&quot;The hang-over of the National Party anti-student crusade is that two-thirds of students are not eligible for income support, no matter how bad their financial situation is. I&#39;m calling on the new government to place all unemployed students on the community wage (student) during their summer break.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Bradford made her comments after Green Co-Leader Rod Donald asked the House today what measures the government was putting in place to assist tertiary unemployed tertiary students this summer, and was told that a wage subsidy was being looked at.</p>
<p>&quot;Investigating a student wage subsidy is not going to help students feed themselves over the next two months,&quot; said Ms Bradford. &quot;Foodbanks last summer were flooded with unemployed students stranded by the National Party restrictions on community wage (student) eligibility. We don&#39;t want to see that again this Christmas.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1998, the National government decreed that only students who were receiving a student allowance were eligible to receive the community wage (student) during the summer holidays.</p>
<p>Ms Bradford said a low parental income threshold for student allowances had excluded many students from the community wage (student), even though their parents could not help them financially over the summer.</p>
<p>&quot;Students are the only group in society who are unable to obtain government income support when they are out of work,&quot; said Ms Bradford. &quot;It&#39;s no good aiming at a knowledge economy, when you are punishing the young people who will form the foundation for it.&quot;</p>
