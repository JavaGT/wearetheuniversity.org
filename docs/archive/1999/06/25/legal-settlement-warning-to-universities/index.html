alt=)The recent out of court settlement reached between Victoria University of Wellington and four Environmental Studies students is a warning to all Education providers. &quot;Regardless of the outcome of this case, the willingness of students to legally challenge their institutions sends a clear message to these institutions - get your house in order&quot; said Victoria University of Wellington Students&#39; Association President Hamish Hopkinson. &quot;While we do not support legal action and actively dissuade people from going to court, we recognise that frustrated students will continue to see it as a last resort.&quot;</p>
<p>Since this court case was started, institutions have strengthened their internal quality procedures, which are assisted where there are universal Students&#39; Associations, throughout the country. Hopkinson says these procedures offer the best avenue for resolving problems. &quot;This court case has dragged on for years. The legal process by itself does not ensure the quality qualification students study for.&quot; Hopkinson says he would caution against future legal challenges. &quot;Aggrieved students should see their association for advice.&quot;</p>
<p>Hopkinson is also concerned for the effect that legal action has on current students. The Environmental Studies degree at Victoria was completely re-worked yet the students studying towards it now have been tarred by media coverage of problems with a course seven years ago. &quot;While some people may feel justifiably aggrieved, the longer term effect is the devaluation of similar degrees for consequent students.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We call for an Education Ombudsman, independent of the institutions where, if internal mechanisms fail, aggrieved students can turn&quot; argued Hopkinson. &quot;When most students are paying $3000 a year in fees and some as high as $15,000, all students are going to demand greater levels of quality.&quot; But Hopkinson says it&#39;s not just because of fees. &quot;Students deserve top quality even when society properly values and funds education. We are opposed to seeing education as a product - to be bought and sold. Such a notion fails to see the fundamental value to society of education. Education is an ends in itself, not simply a means to a better income&quot;.</p>
