<p>Alliance Wrong Again - Hide</p>
<p>ACT Finance spokesman Rodney Hide said today that the Alliance once again had it completely wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;John Wright is claiming that Parliamentary Library research shows that tax cuts cost jobs and growth. The only problem is that the Library hasn&#39;t done the research as claimed. All the library has done is assemble some very basic data at Mr Wright&#39;s requests. These numbers don&#39;t show anything like what Mr Wright claims.</p>
<p>&quot;An empirical analysis of the relationship between taxes, jobs and growth requires high-powered statistical analysis. We are fortunate in New Zealand that this work has been done by the IRD over four years, with 35 academics involved, a seven-tier peer review process and this work has produced 14 Internationally peer-reviewed journal articles and one text book.</p>
<p>&quot;This research headed up by Dr Patrick Caragata is clear in its results: Less tax, means more growth and more jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;I think John Wright is going to lose this one. He&#39;s pitting one simple graph against hundreds of pages of statistical analysis, a tow-truck driver against some of the world&#39;s leading economists and econometricians, and refereed articles against a simple request for some numbers to the Parliamentary Library. Once again, the Alliance party hasn&#39;t done the work. Once again, the Alliance party has it wrong,&quot; said Rodney Hide.</p>
