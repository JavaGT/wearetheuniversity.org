<p><strong>Thursday, 24 June 1999, 2:07 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>

<p>However, Trevor Mallard said Mrs Dillon, a former National Party Otago Southland Divisional Chair, should have never been appointed in the first place.</p>
<p>&quot;There are ample talented and qualified people with a strong connection to the Hutt Valley who could have been appointed to the board. Instead a Ministerial decision was made to appoint an outsider who the polytechnic would have then had to pay travel and possibly accommodation expenses. That is a waste of education funding.</p>
<p>&quot;Also of concern was the fact that Mrs Dillon finished her last political appointment, as chair of Healthcare Otago, under a cloud of allegations about her role in cuts to health services and over expenditure on executive salaries and conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems her major qualification for the job was that she has been a long time hack for the National Party.</p>
<p>&quot;I asked Tertiary Education Minister Max Bradford to rescind this appointment and I am glad that my efforts have paid off,&quot; Trevor Mallard said.</p>
