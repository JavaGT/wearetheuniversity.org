2000 web site"></a>Labour Cultural Spokesperson Judith Tizard today welcomed the news that True Bliss&#39;s first album Dream has gone platinum.</p>
<p>&quot;This proves that New Zealanders want to hear their music and if they see and hear New Zealand music on television and radio they rush to buy it,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;True Bliss are talented, hard working young New Zealanders who have a lot to offer our music scene. The response of New Zealanders to this group has been phenomimal and their success indicates how important secure funding to New Zealand on Air is because &quot;Pop Stars&quot; could not have been made with out NZ On Air support. Access for New Zealand programmes to prime time television and for New Zealand music to television and radio are also vital.</p>
<p>&quot;Young New Zealanders love True Bliss because they feel they know them as well as loving the music they make. I look forward to dozens of groups of talented New Zealanders making a living for themselves in New Zealand producing great music, as well as looking forward to being able to buy, see and hear the work of the thousands of talented young New Zealanders who see their future in cultural industries.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s policies will make this happen and any amount of vague talk from the Minister of Cultural Affairs will not make one more New Zealand recording available,&quot; Judith Tizard said  </p>
