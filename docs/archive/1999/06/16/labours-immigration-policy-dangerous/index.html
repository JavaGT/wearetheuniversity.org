<p><strong>Wednesday, 16 June 1999, 2:18 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>MEDIA RELEASE<br>GERRY BROWNLEE<br>MP FOR ILAM</p>
<p>LABOUR&#39;S &#39;OPEN BOARDERS&#39; IMMIGRATION POLICY - DANGEROUS</p>
<p>Labour and the Alliance are quite happy to throw open New Zealand&#39;s doors to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants, said Gerry Brownlee, Government Whip and member of the Social Services Select Committee.</p>
<p>&quot;It might only be one boat-load at the moment, but the moment they land thousands more will set off for New Zealand,&quot; Mr Brownlee said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Labour/Alliance bloc have to face up to the hard facts of immigration.<br>&quot;Earlier this year, there was an international conference on Illegal migration in Bangkok and the Chinese officials said they were extremely concerned about the illegal immigration industry.</p>
<p>&quot;This make a mockery of Labour&#39;s claims that they opposed the bill out concern for the communist Chinese Government&#39;s reaction.</p>
<p>&quot;The people who run these illegal immigration schemes are the modern-day slavers. They prey on people&#39;s hopes and dreams in a vicious and calculated way,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>It is unacceptable for Labour and the Alliance to allow this misery to grow. They are crying crocodile tears for want of an agreed immigration policy. New Zealand has a record of generous support for genuine refugees and will always treat those who claim refugee status fairly.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a right to protect our borders from unscrupulous immigration entrepreneurs who seek to profit on our generosity. The Labour/Alliance stance on the Amendment Bill is totally unacceptable&quot; said Mr Brownlee.&quot;</p>
