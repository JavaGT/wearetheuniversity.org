<p>Media Release -- Other</p>
<p>ACT Deputy Leader Hon Ken Shirley today said river tribes with claims for ownership of rivers are looking at the Waitangi Tribunal&#39;s decision, to grant Maori ownership of the Whanganui River, in terms of the precedent it sets for their own claims.</p>
<p>&quot;Claims by the Minister of Treaty Negotiations and the Tribunal itself that the decision does not set a precedent are meaningless. The Tribunal&#39;s own report sets out strong arguments for the return of the Waikato River to Tainui.</p>
<p>&quot;Tainui believe the report affirms their contention that they own the Waikato River.</p>
<p>&quot;The spokesperson for the Mohaka River claimants in the Northern Hawkes Bay said today that if Whanganui Maori get back the water &#39;it&#39;s all go then&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;One lawyer acting for Ngati Pikiau points out that the Whanganui decision has to be an important finding for river claims and that even river tribes who haven&#39;t pressed for ownership in the past may now assert their rights too.</p>
<p>&quot;Manu Paul, spokesperson for Bay of Plenty tribes that are claiming ownership of rivers in the region, is calling on all river claimants to, &#39;take a concerted effort towards the Crown so they can refute the nonsensical statements made by Sir Doug Graham, that Maoris don&#39;t own rivers, when there&#39;s another report that is saying that a proposal is that these peoples have ownership rights and that they should have the title to their river&#39;.</p>

<p>&quot;This is another example of the problems we have with a settlement process that is out of control. The Government now finds itself in a very difficult position in terms of having to respond to the report and move towards settlement with Whanganui Maori.</p>
<p>&quot;Now the report is out, the Government cannot let the matter drag on indefinitely, all peoples around the Whanganui deserve some certainty over the river&#39;s future ownership. All New Zealanders deserve the same certainty about the water, air and sunlight in this country that is now being claimed under the Treaty.</p>
<p>The Government must set out clear parameters and bounds for the settlement process. It should set these down in legislation if necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;The Governments of future generations will continue to face the same problems unless we get the settlement process back on track and set a time frame for the full, fair and final settlement of all legitimate claims,&quot; said Hon Ken Shirley.</p>
