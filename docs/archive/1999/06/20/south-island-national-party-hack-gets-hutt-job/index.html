<p><strong>Sunday, 20 June 1999, 1:51 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>

<p>Trevor Mallard said the Government had appointed Glen Dillon, a former National Party Otago Southland Divisional chair, to the board.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a ridiculous appointment in several regards,&quot; Trevor Mallard said.</p>
<p>&quot;Glen Dillon has no connection with the Hutt and there are ample talented and qualified local people who could be appointed to the board who have a greater interest in the success of the polytechnic.</p>
<p>&quot;She lives in Dunedin and so there are additional costs involved in her attendance at board meetings.</p>
<p>&quot;To top it off, she finished her last political appointment, as chair of Healthcare Otago under a cloud of allegations about her role in cuts to health services and over expenditure on executive salaries and conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems her major qualification for the job is that she has been a long time hack for the National Party.</p>
<p>&quot;I will be asking Tertiary Education Minister Max Bradford to rescind this appointment,&quot; Trevor Mallard said.</p>
