<p>NEW ZEALAND FIRST ACCUSES GOVERNMENT OF DRIVER RE-LICENSING COVER-UP</p>
<p>New Zealand First has accused the government of covering up the true extent of the problems with people renewing their drivers&#39; licences.</p>
<p>The Leader, Rt. Hon. Winston Peters, told a meeting in Cambridge today that the Transport Minister held an emergency meeting with Automobile Association officials during the week after they threatened to withdraw from the scheme.</p>
<p>The AA is administering the relicensing under contract, and there have been many problems, including drivers with adequate eyesight failing tests.</p>
<p>Mr Peters said that thirty per cent of the people seeking to renew their licences were running into problems.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of the problems, some individuals are becoming hostile and are abusing AA staff.</p>
<p>&quot;There have even been two cases of assault,&quot; said Mr Peters.</p>
<p>He said that New Zealand First had asked the Transport Minister a series of questions about the faulty eye test provided to the AA by the Ministry of Transport.<br>…/2<br>- 2 -</p>
<p>&quot;We asked if the test was adequate, and whether those people who failed the test, but later passed a registered optometrist&#39;s test, would be refunded their costs by the Ministry.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister denied there was a problem and also denied there was a case for compensating people who paid for their own test,&quot; said Mr Peters.</p>

<p>He said that the drivers&#39; licence renewal system was in chaos and that the Minister would have to admit it sooner, rather than later.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem with the licences is typical of the incompetence of the dysfunctional Shipley administration.</p>
<p>&quot;No amount of bluster from the Beehive will satisfy the thousands of New Zealanders who are being driven crazy trying to renew their drivers&#39; licences through a flawed system,&quot; said Winston Peters.</p>
