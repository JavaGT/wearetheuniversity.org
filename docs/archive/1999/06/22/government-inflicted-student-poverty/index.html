<p><img src="http://www.vuw.ac.nz/vuwsa/graphics/newlogo.gif" alt="VUWSA web site"><br>Victoria University of Wellington Students&#39; Association President Hamish Hopkinson expressed concern today that students working hard over the mid-year break to ease the financial burden of study may be penalised by a decrease in their student allowances.</p>
<p>&quot;As students are away on leave, trying to take a well earned break, I want to ask why the Government is not giving students a break. Changes to student allowances actively encourage students to work during term, when they should be concentrating on study, by penalising them if they work too much during their break,&quot; Hopkinson said.</p>
<p>&quot;Where the Government once assessed student&#39;s eligibility to an allowance over the course of the year, it is now assessed on a monthly basis. Therefore where previously you could concentrate on study during term with the security of an allowance and work hard during the break to earn a few more dollars, the new policy means that if you earn more than you should in a month then you will lose the following month&#39;s allowance, thus holiday work is discouraged,&quot; Hopkinson said.</p>
<p>&quot;This change in policy actively encourages students not to work during the holidays, something I find hard to understand given the government&#39;s policies in other areas,&quot; Hopkinson said.</p>
<p>The Victoria University of Wellington Students&#39; Association has had to keep the summer foodbank open, a telling reminder of Government policy.</p>
<p>&quot;1999 has not been a good year for students. Jobs were thinner over summer, the penny-pinching government spent millions of dollars restricting the Emergency Unemployment Benefit, which actually saved them very little, and the cost of tertiary education continues to rise,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is just another nail in the coffin. The sooner we have a change of government the better,&quot; Hopkinson concluded.</p>
