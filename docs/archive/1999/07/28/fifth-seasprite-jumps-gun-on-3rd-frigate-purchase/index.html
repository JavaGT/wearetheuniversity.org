<p><strong>Wednesday, 28 July 1999, 12:55 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Defence Minister Max Bradford appears to be trying to force the next Labour government into buying a third frigate.</p>
<p>That&#39;s according to Green Party Defence Spokesman Keith Locke.</p>
<p>Mr Locke today accused Mr Bradford of &quot;jumping the gun&quot; on purchase of a third frigate by announcing the navy will get a fifth Seasprite SH-2G helicopter.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Bradford claims the fifth Seasprite is needed for a three frigate navy, even though an incoming Labour-led government is unlikely to endorse a third ANZAC frigate,&quot; Mr Locke said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Leander frigate Wellington is being phased out, and the Canterbury won&#39;t be far behind.</p>
<p>&quot;The Seasprites are very expensive. According to Mr Bradford, the all-up cost of the fifth marine helicopter is $63 million plus GST. Millions more will be spent annually on operating the helicopter.</p>
<p>&quot;Oddly, Mr Bradford claims that this $63 million &#39;will be funded entirely from the existing Defence budget&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;I have written to Mr Bradford about this because it seems to be a case of Budget duplicity, unless the Defence Force has suddenly saved $63 million since the Budget Estimates were approved a short time ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Under Vote Defence Part A2, there is only mention of spending for &#39;four Seasprite maritime helicopters&#39;. If a fifth Seasprite was planned why wasn&#39;t it mentioned and costed in the Budget.</p>
<p>&quot;The millions wasted on the extra Seasprite would be better spent in social and environmental areas. The whole frigate project is a costly white elephant. Why add to the extravagance,&quot; said Mr Locke.</p>
