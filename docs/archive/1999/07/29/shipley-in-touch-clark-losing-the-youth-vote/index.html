<p><strong>Thursday, 29 July 1999, 11:00 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand Young Nationals congratulate Prime Minister Jenny Shipley for her bold leadership in supporting the standardisation of the drinking age to 18,&quot; said Youth Vice President and New Zealand Young Nationals Chair Daniel Gordon.</p>
<p>&quot;It is interesting, and noteworthy, that National Party leader Jenny Shipley has faith and is in touch with today&#39;s youth whereas the Labour Party leader Helen Clark and her (waiting) successor Phil Goff voted against lowering the Drinking age to 18.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Clark and Goff are going to find it difficult to front up to tertiary institutions stating their usual line that they believe in the future of young people when they turn around and vote against the youth of today,&quot; said Daniel Gordon.</p>
<p>Daniel Gordon further commented on Parliament’s indication towards lowering the drinking age. &quot;This has been a topical issue for youth for many, many years. This is a historic move by Parliament and one, which shows society’s faith in the youth of today.</p>
<p>ENDS.  </p>
