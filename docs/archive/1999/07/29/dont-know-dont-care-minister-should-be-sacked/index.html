<p>Press Release<br>29 July 1999</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#39;t know, don&#39;t care&quot; Minister should be sacked</p>
<p>Green Party Co-Leader Rod Donald has called on Prime Minister Jenny<br>Shipley to sack Social Services Minister Roger Sowry after his performance<br>in the House today.</p>
<p>&quot;I asked the Minister a perfectly sensible question; what was in the lunch<br>boxes for which six WINZ staff paid $100 each at the recent &#39;World Masters<br>of Business&#39; Event,&quot; said Rod Donald.</p>
<p>&quot;In reply the Minister said &#39;I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t care&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;That answer sums up the Minister&#39;s whole attitude towards Work and Income<br>New Zealand. He doesn&#39;t know and he doesn&#39;t care about the extraordinary<br>culture of corporate extravagance which pervades WINZ since his government<br>merged Income Support and the Employment Service.</p>
<p>&quot;Beneficiaries and taxpayers up and down the country will be appalled to<br>learned that the Minister in charge of the government&#39;s biggest budget<br>doesn&#39;t care whether taxpayers&#39; funds are squandered by senior staff<br>attending lavish talk-fests or used wisely to help struggling<br>beneficiaries survive.</p>
<p>&quot;The $100 spent on one day&#39;s lunch is more than most superannuitants, sole<br>parents, job seekers and students have for food for a whole week.</p>
<p>&quot;What sort of government is Jenny Shipley running? Certainly not one that<br>exhibits the basic principles of her much-touted code of social<br>responsibility.</p>
<p>&quot;The sooner this government is put out of its misery the better,&quot; he said.  </p>
