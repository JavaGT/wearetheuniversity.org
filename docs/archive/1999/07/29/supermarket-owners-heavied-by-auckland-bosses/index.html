<p><strong>Thursday, 29 July 1999, 2:32 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Many supermarket managers are uncomfortable about a pro-genetic-engineering pamphlet they are being forced to give to shoppers, Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said today.</p>
<p>Supermarkets around New Zealand are being approached by Green Party members and the group Revolt Against Genetic Engineering (RAGE) during a week of action against the pamphlets.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of the light-green coloured brochures, headed GM Foods - Answers to Your Questions, have been published by the Grocery Industry Council, and many are being automatically placed in shoppers&#39; bags by supermarket staff.</p>
<p>&quot;The paper purports to be unbiased but uses language of the United States-based food and chemical giant Monsanto,&quot; Ms Fitzsimons said. &quot;Some supermarket managers have told us that while they find the pamphlets biased, they haven&#39;t any choice but to give them to shoppers, because the supermarket chain bosses, mostly in Auckland, have ordered them to do so,&quot; Ms Fitzsimons said.</p>
<p>The Green Party, RAGE, the Safe Food Campaign and Greenpeace have all been trying to provide more balanced information for consumers on the issue, and a handful of supermarkets have agreed to take brochures from the party and the groups.</p>
<p>&quot;Most supermarkets are declining to stock our pamphlets without authority from their head offices, which are preventing individual managers from even commenting publicly on the issue of genetic engineering,&quot; Ms Fitzsimons said.</p>
