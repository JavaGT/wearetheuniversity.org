<p><strong>Friday, 16 July 1999, 12:30 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association">Victoria University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www.vuw.ac.nz/vuwsa/graphics/newlogo.gif" alt="VUWSA web site">Students&#39; attitudes towards healthy living are due for a shake up, as the nationally organised Healthy Lifestyles Week rolls into town. The week sees a number of events and activities happening on and around campus, all with the stated aim of promoting more individual and planetary health consciousness among students.</p>
<p>On Wednesday 28 July a large number of health related groups are setting up shop in the University Quad. There is a great diversity of groups appearing, ranging from the Push Play campaign to the NZ Prostitutes Collective.</p>
<p>The offer of a free BBQ (courtesy of the NZ Beef &amp; Lamb Board) promises to be a big drawcard for undernourished students.</p>
<p>The following day the campus hosts community and environmental groups, including Trade Aid, the Karori Sanctuary, Peace Movement Aotearoa and our very own City Voice.</p>
<p>Students Association representative Chris Hubscher states &quot;We see the concept of healthy lifestyles as extending beyond the individual. Personal fitness alone won&#39;t make you healthy. A truly healthy lifestyle includes respect for our environment, as well as ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Other activities over the course of the week include nutrition seminars, free sports club trial evenings and provision of heavily discounted access to the Recreation Centre&#39;s weights room.</p>
<p>There won&#39;t be any attempt to emulate Otago University Student Association&#39;s No Booze Week, where the Student Executive attempt to swear off alcohol for the duration.</p>

<p>&quot;That couldn&#39;t happen here&quot; says Mr Hubscher. &quot;Not that our Executive are excessively fond of a tipple, but we have a responsibility to keep the Student Bar afloat. Anyway, if they must have a drink, that&#39;s their affair. My primary concern is to ensure that they recycle the glass.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Healthy Lifestyles Week - 26-30 July, Victoria University.</strong></p>
