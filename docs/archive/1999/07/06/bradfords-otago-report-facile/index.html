<p><a href="http://www.labour.org.nz"><img src="http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg" alt="Labour
2000 web site"></a>Labour&#39;s energy spokesperson Pete Hodgson has described the Ministry of Commerce&#39;s report into the Central Otago power cuts as facile and fictional.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea that the power reforms have probably made things better is as credible as saying that the price of electricity is plummeting. The communication difficulties that were experienced were a direct result of the reforms. They would have been made worse if the Government&#39;s favourite retailer, First Electric, had entered the Central Otago market because its call centre is in Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;By contrast the amalgamation of lines companies made no difference, because staff were brought in from Invercargill and Oamaru, outside Delta&#39;s ownership area.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the report should have just thanked the staff who worked so long and hard, as well as the residents for their stoic forbearance. Trying to turn a serious event like this into a sales pitch for the reforms is a thoroughly desperate action from a thoroughly dismal minister.&quot;</p>
