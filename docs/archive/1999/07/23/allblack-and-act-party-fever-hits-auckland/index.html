<p>Allblack fever and ACT party fever will hit the city of sails this weekend with the relaunch of Auckland Central Candidate Donna Awatere Huata&#39;s 1999 Election campaign.</p>
<p>Act MP Donna Awatere Huata will send a strong clear message to Aucklanders in downtown Victoria Park Saturday 24th July 1.00pm.</p>
<p>ACT&#39;s Education spokesperson says this election will take the country into the 21st century. It&#39;s time Auckland central voters made the right choice, to insure their needs are properly represented in the next government&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Providing our youth with the right education will be the key to this country&#39;s success, every child must start school ready to learn, no kiwi teenager should drop out of school simply because they&#39;re bored and unmotivated&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Graffiti and the vandalisation of Auckland&#39;s image by the city&#39;s growing number of street kids is an example of our education system not meeting the needs of our children.</p>
<p>Donna Awatere Huata says she&#39;ll do whatever it takes to insure these kids don&#39;t fall through the cracks onto the city&#39;s pavement where they only way they can express their creativity and emotional outbursts is through a few blasts of the spray can.</p>
<p>Act Leader Richard Prebble is also speaking alongside his Auckland central candidate as a mark of commitment to Auckland voters.</p>
<p>&quot; Donna Awatere Huata is an example of outstanding talent that ACT is bringing to Parliament. She&#39;s without doubt the most outstanding Maori MP in my time in Parliament.&quot;</p>

<p>Richard Prebble says I believe she has an important contribution to make to the education sector-not just for Maori, but for the whole country.</p>
<p>The former Auckland Central MP Richard Prebble says Auckland Central has a tradition of sending outstanding MP&#39;s to Parliament- ït&#39;s time it was revived.&quot;</p>
<p>ACT Auckland Central Campaign relaunch Saturday 24th July 1.00pm Victoria Park.</p>
