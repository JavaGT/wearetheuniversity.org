<p><strong>Tuesday, 27 July 1999, 10:48 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT Education and Spokesperson Donna Awatere Huata has strongly attacked Labour&#39;s proposed Education policies saying &quot; a Labour Government will drag New Zealand Schools back into the Seventies.&quot;</p>
<p>The Act MP says &quot;there is not a single new idea in their policies. Far from offering students more choice, there will be fewer opportunities for them to succeed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is proposing more funding to close the gap between schools, but no measurement of the impact of the policies in schools. The quality of education children receive can&#39;t be improved without some form of national assessment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Labour proposes lifting the standard of education in the poorest 10% of schools, over half of which are Maori. But what failing schools require is more innovation and choice, the kind of choice provided under the TIE Scheme and Charter Schools.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The state education system has already failed, and pouring more money into failing schools isn&#39;t the answer. Measuring the amount of money put in, doesn&#39;t necessarily guarantee an improvement in the quality of education.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Labour also say there will be no major overhaul of the school system, despite a Ministry of Education Adult Literacy Report released last year showing that 50 % of the population are unable to read and write adequately.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do we have to wait for these figures to rise 70% before Labour will take action?&quot; Mrs Awatere Huata said.</p>
