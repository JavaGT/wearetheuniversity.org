<p><strong>Tuesday, 2 November 1999, 11:36 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>&quot;Indications that Auckland University will join Canterbury in raising tuition fees is a clear indication of Nationals failure in government&quot; said Karen Skinner, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>The University of Auckland&#39;s proposed Year 2000 budget, announced today, recommends an average fee rise of 10.9%. &quot;It is shameful that once again we see students being forced to pay increasing fees. Student debt is already out of control, and we cannot afford anymore&quot; said Ms Skinner.</p>
<p>&quot;Proposed increases in Medical student fees will have huge flow-on effects for the health system. Recent student action to highlight the impact that growing debt will have on user-pays in the health system has obviously fallen on deaf ears within government.</p>
<p>&quot;Auckland University Vice Chancellor John Hood seems to have forgotten that he is running a University not a business when he talks of being &#39; very competitive&#39;. This again shows the result of government policy that has forced increasing competition in the tertiary sector.</p>
<p>&quot;We need a tertiary sector that has increased funding, and a positive direction. To achieve that we also need to vote out ACT and National&quot; concluded Ms Skinner</p>
