<p>&quot;We&#39;ve all heard Jenny Shipley criticise Labour&#39;s policy of no interest on student loans for full-time students while they are still studying. She says that it is unfair because only half of students have a loan while &#39;some students work or their mums and dads support them&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s report shows that Mrs Shipley is only telling part truths. In fact, more than 70% of full-time students take out student loans.</p>
<p>&quot;The &#39;half&#39; that Mrs Shipley refers to is the proportion of all students who take out loans, including part-time students.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a significant difference. There were more part time student eligible for loans last year than full-time students but their take-up rate was less than 20%. Part time students also borrowed on average less than half of what full-time students borrowed.</p>
<p>&quot;The average amount borrowed by full-time students each year increased by nearly 60% between 1992 and 1998 to $6,311.</p>
<p>&quot;National are trying to paint a picture that student debt is not a problem. They are wrong. Around the country, young people are being forced into a &#39;mortgage without a house&#39; in order to get a job.</p>
<p>&quot;Student debt now totals $3.44 billion and the Government has the gall to call that &#39;a significant government asset&#39;,&quot; Steve Maharey said.  </p>
