<p><strong>Thursday, 25 November 1999, 4:51 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.labour.org.nz"><img src="http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg" alt="Labour 2000 web site"></a><br>A Labour government will take decisive action to stop the &#39;brain-drain&#39; which is seeing newly qualified medical professionals fleeing the country, Labour health spokesperson Annette King and Labour tertiary education spokesperson Steve Maharey said today.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a national shortage of junior doctors which is severely hampering the provision of services at some hospitals.</p>
<p>&quot;Positions that should have been filled by July are still vacant. 17 junior doctors are urgently needed in the Wellington area, 11 in Christchurch.</p>
<p>&quot;30 percent of the doctors graduating in New Zealand are shifting to Australia. They are going to a more supportive environment and are leaving behind the huge student loan debts that the National Government has burdened them with.</p>
<p>&quot;We must do more to keep our best and brightest in New Zealand. That is why a Labour government will not charge interest on loans while fulltime and other low-income students are studying.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour will undertake a thorough review of the loans system. We will look the economic and social impact of high student debt levels and whether fear of such debt is driving students overseas.</p>
<p>&quot;The current doctor shortage certainly indicates that is the case.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has both short and long term solutions to assist hospitals recruit staff. In the short term Labour will establish a central fund which public hospitals can access to cover the recruitment costs of obtaining sufficient staff.</p>

<p>&quot;Labour will also establish a Health Workforce Advisory Committee charged with developing a co-ordinated workplace strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;National has created a disastrous scenario. They have burdened medical students with massive debt. As a result many leave the country after graduating. They may never return; while New Zealand hospitals face a desperate staff shortage.</p>
<p>&quot;A Labour government will begin work immediately to repair the damage,&quot; Annette King and Steve Maharey said.</p>
