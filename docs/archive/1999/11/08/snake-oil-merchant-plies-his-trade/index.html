<p><strong>Monday, 8 November 1999, 9:28 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.labour.org.nz"><img src="http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg" alt="Labour
2000 web site"></a>&quot;Winston Peters is like a snake oil merchant - he refuses to tell New Zealanders what he is really trying to sell them,&quot; Labour deputy leader Michael Cullen said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Peters&#39; announcement yesterday carefully avoided the real issues. What he needs to clarify is whether or not NZ First would support a budget which contained policies he claims to oppose.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, would Mr Peters support a budget which sought to eliminate free doctors visit for children aged under six years?</p>
<p>&quot;Would Mr Peters support a budget which proposed increases in the costs of tertiary education?</p>
<p>&quot;Would Mr Peters support a budget which continued the process of reducing the married rate of superannuation from 65 to 60 percent of the average, net, ordinary time wage?</p>
<p>&quot;All that yesterday&#39;s announcement confirmed was that a vote for NZ First is a vote for confusion.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Peters is very reluctant to spell out the nature of government his party would support. Presumably that&#39;s because his preferred option - National - is so unpalatable to his diminishing band of potential supporters.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet again the message is loud and clear for all New Zealanders. Only casting their party vote for Labour will ensure a stable Labour-led government following different policies from the extreme agenda a National-Act government would adopt,&quot; Dr Cullen said.  </p>
