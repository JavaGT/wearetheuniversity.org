<p>November 22, 1999</p>
<p>Jeanette&#39;s record, and pledges, in manifesto</p>
<p>The majority of Coromandel voters will be hand-delivered MP Jeanette Fitzsimons&#39; manifesto in the week leading up to the election.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be knocking on doors all round the electorate for the next week,&quot; said Ms Fitzsimons, the Green Party co-leader who is leading the race for the Coromandel seat.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the booklet is well worth a read, and we&#39;re taking the time to put it in peoples&#39; hands.&quot;</p>
<p>The remaining three thousand booklets will be distributed to more remote voters by rural delivery mail.</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons said the response to the hand delivery service had so far been very positive, even from non-Green voters.</p>
<p>&quot;People appreciate the chance to discuss the issues that concern them personally, and clear up some of the misinformation that has been spread around the electorate.&quot;</p>
<p>The colourful 16 page booklet outlines Ms Fitzsimons&#39; commitments to the electorate, based on Green Party policies. It includes pages on the future of farming, how to rebuild the local economy and how to upgrade Thames hospital to a full secondary hospital.</p>
<p>It also contains the parliamentary voting record of Ms Fitzsimons and National MP Murray McLean on key bills during the 1996-1999 term.</p>
<p>&quot;The information has been verified through the Parliamentary library,&quot; said Ms Fitzsimons. &quot;I am happy to stand on my record.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In 1996, 66 per cent of the Coromandel didn&#39;t want a National MP, but by splitting the vote that&#39;s what they ended up with,&quot; said Ms Fitzsimons. &quot;People are starting to realise that voting for me is the only way to get a change.&quot;</p>
<p>Jeanette Fitzsimons MP 07 8686641, 07 8686511, 025 586068, 025 2471489, 025 2874325</p>
