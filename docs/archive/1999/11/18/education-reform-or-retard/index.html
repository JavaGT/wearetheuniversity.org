<p><strong>Thursday, 18 November 1999, 12:12 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>New Zealand&#39;s current education system is not working and change is the only solution say ACT NZ Education spokesman Donna Awatere-Huata and Rongotai candidate Stephen Franks.</p>
<p>The duo will be discussing ACT&#39;s education policy at a public meeting in Newtown tonight.</p>
<p>&quot;We must set a standard of excellence in education for every child,&quot; said Mrs Awatere Huata, &quot;Our failure to do so has resulted in one in four children leaving school unable to read and write properly&quot;.</p>
<p>Mrs Awatere Huata will explain how many of the problem areas exposed in the latest New Zealand Council for Educational Research report, would disappear under ACT&#39;s education policy. She will also outline her own private members&#39; bill on the direct resourcing of secondary schools as well as ACT&#39;s key education issues of greater parental choice and the regular assessment of student performance.</p>
<p>Rongotai candidate Stephen Franks, a seven year Board of Trustees veteran, will talk about the implications of school zoning laws, Labour&#39;s proposed abolition of the Education Review Office and the restructuring of the British education system under Tony Blair&#39;s Labour government.</p>
<p>&quot;As Tony Blair has such a high focus on education it should be no surprise that many of the reforms undertaken by his (Labour) government have been standard ACT policy for years,&quot; said Mr Franks.</p>
<p>The public meeting will start at 7.30pm and will be held at South West Intermediate School staffroom, 30 Waripori St tonight.</p>
