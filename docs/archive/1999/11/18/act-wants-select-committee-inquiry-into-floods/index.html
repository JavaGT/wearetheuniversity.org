<p><strong>Thursday, 18 November 1999, 11:58 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT Leader Hon Richard Prebble today said ACT would insist that a special<br>Select Committee of Parliament investigate who should be held liable for the<br>latest flood in Alexandra.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT&#39;s candidate for Otago, Gerry Eckhoff has been campaigning on this issue<br>for some time. The facts are clear. Even in the horrendous 1878 flood the<br>Clutha river stayed within its banks. But, in the three floods in the last six<br>years with less rain the flood damage has been greater.</p>
<p>&quot;The Roxburgh dam is silting up and forcing the Clutha to spill its banks.</p>
<p>&quot;The common law is clear - those who cause a nuisance are strictly liable.</p>
<p>&quot;The small businesses of Alexandra don&#39;t have the financial muscle to take on<br>Contact Energy. Contact Energy is saying that it&#39;s a Government responsibility<br>because it was the Government that built the dam. There is clearly a role for<br>Parliament to determine the extent to which the Government should accept the<br>liability.</p>
<p>&quot;Shopkeepers, businesses and home owners can&#39;t wait three to four years for a<br>Court case. They need immediate action which ACT MPs will insist Parliament<br>takes,&quot; said Hon Richard Prebble.</p>
