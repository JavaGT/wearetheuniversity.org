<p>Extracts from a speech by Rt Hon Winston Peters to a public meeting in Garden Place, Victoria Street, Hamilton at 1230 pm Thursday 18th November 1999.</p>
<p>NZ First’s Enlightened Economic Policy - Unlike Act’s Amnesia And Deceit</p>
<p>Today we are releasing our economic statement – much of which has been part of specific portfolio announcements – together with our budgetary accounting for the next three years.</p>
<p>It’s based on a formula of multiplying our exports three hundred per cent in the next two decades.</p>
<p>Key components of Tax policy, Research and Development, Education and Immigration programmes are designed and focused towards this result.</p>
<p>New Zealand First has a plan for provincial New Zealand, for the farms and the towns and the provincial capitals.</p>
<p>Trade has always been our lifeblood – we recognise that export led growth is the key to our future.</p>
<p>Our plan is to boost the productive and export sector.</p>
<p>We will promote economic policies with an export focus.</p>
<p>We will amend the Reserve Bank Act so it becomes more geared to exporting and employment.</p>
<p>We will establish a New Zealand export banking facility to provide export credit guarantees and venture capital funding.</p>
<p>We will encourage, through tax breaks, greater spending on research and development and exporting strategies in line with leading economies.</p>
<p>We will amend the Employment Contracts Act to improve fairness – while still retaining flexibility.</p>
<p>We will use the community wage to dramatically expand apprenticeships and other training opportunities.</p>

<p>We’ll reduce tax compliance costs and most of all we will create an internal investment scheme with the establishment of our Superannuation scheme.</p>
<p>This means that we will not have to rely on foreign credit.</p>
<p>This is what is causing all the problems at the moment.</p>
<p>ACT REALLY THE PARTY OF ROGERGNOME RURAL WRECKERS</p>
<p>Today I also want to talk about some of these problems – and to remind the country who caused them.</p>
<p>To do this – let’s recall the great war correspondent who said that: “TRUTH IS ALWAYS THE FIRST CASUALTY OF WAR”.</p>
<p>Truth is the casualty of the deceitful election campaign run by ACT.</p>
<p>ACT is most extreme political group in the country – and the baby of Roger Douglas and Richard Prebble.</p>
<p>ACT, the 1984 Labour government dressed up as a benevolent rural party, is really a wolf dressed up in sheep’s clothing!</p>
<p>ACT represents big business – foreign owned corporates and no one else.</p>
<p>Their MPs are the best that foreign money can buy.</p>
<p>Earlier this week Labour’s Epsom candidate described them as Nazis and Fascists.</p>
<p>They certainly use classic Nazi tactics of repeating big lies over and over again until gullible groups within the community start to believe them.</p>
<p>They keep saying that ACT stands for rural New Zealand – that is a lie!</p>
<p>Here are the facts that provincial and rural New Zealanders should remember.</p>
<p>ACT is led by a group of former Labour cabinet ministers from 1984.</p>
<p>During their time in government they closed 22 rural hospitals (29 hospitals in total, nationally) and here is the list for any ACT supporters.</p>
<p>Last year Roger Douglas told the ACT conference that they aimed to cut Health spending by 80 per cent within five years – that means there will not be any public health system left.</p>
<p>The sick in rural areas will have to travel to cities, and Australia to get health care, that should be their’s as a right.</p>
<p>Roger Douglas promised to cut education spending by 60%, ACT have promised to reduce government spending 100% for full-time students.</p>
<p>They have also said that they would not subsidise research and agriculture training.</p>
<p>If ACT get their way, getting a farming degree in Massey or Lincoln Universities will cost $70,000 a year.</p>
<p>Only those in Wellington Central and Epsom will be able to afford a decent education.</p>
<p>Massey University’s Agriculture Technology Department, and the equivalent in Waikato are currently complaining that their research work and training for farming students are having to cut corners.</p>
<p>They say that Agricultural research will die if funding is cut any further.</p>
<p>ACT have promised to privatise roads – that means toll gates every few hundred yards in the cities while provincial roads will be reduced to dirt tracks.</p>
<p>Rural New Zealand was almost destroyed by Douglas and Prebble between 1984 and 1990.</p>
<p>In December 1985 there were 181 thousand New Zealanders working on farms – by October 1990 this number fell to 154 thousand.</p>
<p>This meant that 27 thousand people were forced off the land or lost jobs on farms under the policies of the people who now run ACT, while rural unemployment trebled.</p>
<p>Let’s look at what these people did to our nation’s finances.</p>
<p>When they took office in 1984, the New Zealand dollar bought 59c Australian, and 49c US.</p>
<p>By the time they left it those figures had gone to 76c and 61c respectively.</p>
<p>This means that in 6 years imports were 30% cheaper, and our exports lost 30% in value.</p>
<p>Importers, money shufflers and speculators became incredibly rich, and exporters, like those in the rural sector, went to the wall.</p>
<p>When Labour took power in 1984, there were 70 million sheep in New Zealand. By the time they left power there were only 55million—farms lost more than 2 million sheep a year under Labour.</p>
<p>Between 1984 and 1990 the value of all the products and services of the rural sector (the GDP of rural New Zealand) actually shrank by 21% in real terms.</p>
<p>While Labour were in power, inflation averaged 10.3%, destroying the savings and property values.</p>
<p>In June 1987, when Roger Douglas was Minister of Finance, and Prebble was his deputy, inflation was 17.9 per cent – the highest in 72 years of keeping records.</p>
<p>Imagine what that did to asset values for farmers.</p>
<p>Interest rates for farms and businesses averaged 17.6% over the whole time that Labour were in power, and in April 1987 the rate of interest was between 23 and 26%.</p>
<p>These people say they are the rural party and that they stand for provincial New Zealand.</p>
<p>I repeat – those statements are lies and I challenge Prebble and the rest of his ACT gnomes to a public debate about his rural policies before a provincial audience anywhere in New Zealand.</p>
<p>TREATY DECEIT</p>
<p>These people say that, on the Treaty of Waitangi, ACT stands for rural property owners in Taranaki.</p>
<p>This is yet another lie.</p>
<p>New Zealand First arranged for the compensation deal for Taranaki farmers on Maori leasehold land, at the request of the head of Federated Farmers when I was Treasurer.</p>
<p>(Look at the pathetic compensation mechanism of Treasury papers in 1990 when Prebble and Co were running things.)</p>
<p>ACT’s Owen Jennings – their rural spokesman - a former Federated Farmers President knows what really happened – but he keeps spreading the lie.</p>
<p>Remember him? He’s the one who didn’t have a meeting about a pyramid selling investment scheme in his office!</p>
<p>When I nailed him in Parliament he took a month off work to escape the heat!</p>
<p>EXPORT WAGES LAG BEHIND<br>There is only one party fighting for the Heartland and that is New Zealand First.</p>
<p>We know that seventy per cent of the real wealth of this country is produced in the provinces but it is not acknowledged by most politicians and bureaucrats in Wellington.</p>
<p>This is how it works. Richard Prebble’s final resting place – Wellington Central – produces the least amount of goods for export per capita than anywhere else in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Southland produces the most.</p>
<p>Wellington Central has the highest average wages in New Zealand while Southland has the lowest.</p>
<p>This tells us exactly what is wrong in this country.</p>
<p>It also tells us a lot about the sort of people who vote ACT.</p>
<p>ACT’S SINISTER SOCIAL DOCTRINE</p>
<p>Their social policies have sinister overtones. Remember the policy ideas being circulated earlier this year?</p>
<p>Muriel Newman, in her book, advocates stealing for people who cant get enough food.</p>
<p>Owen Dance, a former member of ACT’s Board circulated policy discussion papers which suggested:</p>
<p> A return to debtor’s prison.</p>
<p> Capital punishment, flogging and castration.</p>
<p> Bankrupt people being sold into slavery. That is what many of our ancestors fled from.</p>
<p> Abolishing the Domestic Purposes Benefit so many women would go bankrupt.</p>
<p> Instead of being sold into slavery, these women would be offered a choice of partners to marry.</p>
<p> If that did not happen they would have to enter a relationship like marriage with the State.</p>
<p> Another policy idea was arresting people at random for so-called vagrancy.</p>
<p> The idea the Government should be taking on more power. Drivers licenses with microchips.</p>
<p>We have all these ideas – anyone who wants to have a look can see them in black and white.</p>
<p>Richard Prebble is not talking about these things on the election campaign – but his followers have been.</p>
<p>Earlier this week a Labour candidate called ACT Nazis and Fascists.</p>
<p>They certainly use the Nazi tactic of repeating big lies over and over again until gullible people start believing them.</p>
<p>They keep saying that they will reduce taxes – but not health or education services. Don’t believe them.</p>
<p>Remember 1984 – for the biggest lie of them all. Railway workers spent sixty thousand dollars on Richard Prebble going around the country saying that he would save Railways and their jobs.</p>
<p>Remember that?</p>
<p>Remember what happened to the Railways and the jobs?</p>
<p>Remember the lie?</p>
<p>That is Richard Prebble – That is ACT.</p>
