<p><strong>Monday, 15 November 1999, 12:58 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First Deputy Leader, Mr Peter Brown has expressed his concern at the discrepancy between the Alliance and Labour parties’ tax policies and opinions stated by their local candidates.</p>
<p>“I was surprised yesterday to hear an Alliance candidate state to a Bay of Plenty Grey Power meeting his belief that proposed Alliance tax increases should not take effect at $60,000 but rather in excess of $85,000.”</p>
<p>Mr Brown said he listened incredulously as the Alliance candidate then proceeded to advise a questioner as to how to avoid the extra tax at that level of salary.</p>
<p>The Labour candidate appeared to concur with these assertions.</p>
<p>“This is absolutely disgraceful”, said Mr Brown. “The Alliance and Labour have committed themselves to a coalition and are advocating huge tax payer expenditure, yet their candidates openly express their disagreement with the proposed tax increases.</p>
<p>“To date, Alliance policy pledges appear to total in excess of $4 billion per year, to be funded by only the top 5% of taxpayers. This equates to $44,000 per person”, claims Mr Brown.</p>
<p>New Zealand First has pledged not to decrease taxation so as to fund core social policy. Longer term solutions lie in growing our economy through exports and providing a savings base through a compulsory superannuation scheme.</p>
<p>Mr Brown says Labour and the Alliance should follow New Zealand First’s lead, and clearly spell out their position.</p>
<p>“I challenge the Alliance candidate to advise New Zealanders how his party intends to fund their promises of free tertiary education, increased benefits and free health care.</p>
<p>“When that matter has been clarified, the Labour candidate needs to state whether he supports that policy fully, in part, or not at all”, concluded Mr Brown.</p>
<p>“Let the truth be known.”</p>
