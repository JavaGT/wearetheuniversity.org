<p><strong>Monday, 15 November 1999, 2:00 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.labour.org.nz"><img src="http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg" alt="Labour

<p>&quot;The status quo is not an option. The choice is between a change to a Labour-led Government or a strong lurch to the right with Act being the policy powerhouse in a new rightwing coalition with National.</p>
<p>&quot;And we know that Act will argue hard for its 20 percent tax rate in the coalition negotiations because tax is the most important issue on Act&#39;s agenda.</p>
<p>Act&#39;s tax cut programme would give another $450 a week to Jenny Shipley which somebody would have to pay for because there was no such thing as a free tax cut.</p>
<p>Among those who would have to pay were the elderly, most of whom would get nothing from Act&#39;s tax policy because they earned less than $40,000 a year, Dr Cullen said.</p>
<p>&quot;Act talks of freezing government spending - probably for a minimum of three years.<br>For New Zealand Superannuation that means even the new 60 percent floor for the married rate will have to be breached.</p>
<p>&quot;It will mean a cut in payments to hospital and disability services of nearly 6 percent - enough to wipe out thousands of operations and threaten home help services.</p>
<p>&quot;Senior citizens cannot afford a lurch to the right to feed the greed of Mrs Shipley and her colleagues for tax cuts to benefit themselves. They need a Labour Government to protect their interests and their standard of living,&quot; Dr Cullen said.</p>
