<p><strong>Monday, 15 November 1999, 8:31 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Genetically engineered naked sheep, with no wool on them at all, is New<br>Zealand&#39;s latest &quot;mad&quot; biotechnology scheme, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>Party agriculture spokesperson Ian Ewen-Street, an organic pastoral farmer<br>based in Marlborough, said the plan has been devised by the Crown Research<br>Institute AgResearch, at its Lincoln base. The scientist leading the<br>research, Dr Andy Bray, has said on the AgResearch website he is about to<br>try to sell the idea to sheep industry leaders, with the aim of producing<br>large numbers of naked sheep for mainstream agriculture.</p>
<p>&quot;I have to ask our government scientists, is nothing sacred,&quot; Mr Ewen-Street<br>said. &quot;When I first heard of this I thought it was a joke. Next they&#39;ll be<br>trying to engineer dogs which don&#39;t bark and cows we can&#39;t milk.</p>
<p>&quot;But seriously, there are major questions of animal cruelty involved here,<br>especially when considering sheep without wool in the middle of winter.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ewen-Street said the AgResearch scientists were arguing that some farmers<br>specialising in meat production would prefer to avoid the hassles that wool<br>somethings brings.</p>
<p>&quot;AgResearch is pitching to farmers using the argument of convenience.<br>Dagging, crutching and treating for flystrike are all unpleasant jobs, which<br>could be avoided, the scientists argue, if sheep had no wool.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s also the argument that wool isn&#39;t fetching much for farmers at<br>present under New Zealand&#39;s radical free market policies.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr Ewen-Street said the genetic engineering scheme had come out of a major<br>project funded by the taxpayer, and carried out by AgResearch and Otago<br>University to build a total &quot;genetic map&quot; of the sheep, with genes then<br>added or subtracted. Government scientists hoped to produce &quot;designer<br>sheep&quot;, with wool-less meaty sheep for meat farmers, and extra woolly sheep<br>for wool farmers.</p>
<p>&quot;But the economics of this is greatly outweighed by the damage to our image<br>overseas from these mad-cap GE schemes. It is absolutely certain that<br>European consumers will boycott New Zealand produce if we continue along<br>this route.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ewen-Street, who is number three on the Greens&#39; party list, will issue<br>the Green Party agriculture and rural affairs policy to the Press Gallery<br>today. It will include a call for New Zealand agriculture to be GE-free.</p>
