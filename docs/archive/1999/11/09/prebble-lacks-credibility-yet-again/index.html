<p>&quot;Richard Prebble&#39;s proposal would pour an additional $838 million into building and running prisons over a three year term of government. That is more than a year&#39;s entire Police budget,&quot; Phil Goff said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is just not credible for Act to say they are going to cut $3.7 billion from government expenditure, at the same time as increasing justice spending by nearly $1 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if those sorts of sums were available - why would you blow it all on a low-return measure like Truth in Sentencing instead of prevention, policing, and tougher measures targeted at the hard core of repeat offenders?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;United States studies conclude that spending just an additional US$1 million on treatment for drug offenders would reduce serious crime 15 times more effectively than lengthening prison terms.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Goff rejected Mr Prebble&#39;s claims that his measure would not cost as much as the Department for Corrections estimate.</p>
<p>&quot;The only way to avoid the cost is for sentences imposed to be reduced to compensate for Truth in Sentencing. In other words, instead of sentencing 6 years to serve 4, simply imposing a 4 year sentence. That&#39;s what the &#39;successful&#39; and &#39;affordable&#39; Truth in Sentencing policy in Victoria did - meaning prisoners do not actually spend more time behind bars.</p>
<p>&quot;If this is what Mr Prebble has in mind, his policy is not only unworkable but also fundamentally dishonest,&quot; Mr Goff said.  </p>
