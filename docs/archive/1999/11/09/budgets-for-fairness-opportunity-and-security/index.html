<p><strong>Tuesday, 9 November 1999, 5:04 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.labour.org.nz"><img src="http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg" alt="Labour
2000 web site"></a><br>Labour deputy Leader Michael Cullen today released Labour&#39;s pre-election fiscal update saying it was the budgetary framework for fairness, opportunity and security.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s emphasis is on responsible budgets designed for ordinary New Zealand families. We aim to improve life for the mums and dads who struggle to give a good start and opportunities to their children and for the superannuitants who have borne the brunt of nine long years of National government.</p>
<p>&quot;National and Act want tax cuts for the wealthy. We want a better standard of living for the great majority,&quot; Dr Cullen said.</p>
<p>&quot;National is now promising tax cuts, around two thirds of which will go to the top 5 percent of taxpayers and to predominantly foreign-owned corporates.</p>
<p>&quot;By rejecting those and asking the top 5 percent to pay a little more, Labour will be able to:</p>
<p>· Restore the level of the married rate for the pension to 65 percent of the average, ordinary time weekly wage on April 1 next year.<br>· Introduce a fairer student loans scheme that abolishes the piling up of interest while people are still students.<br>· Cut waiting times for surgery.<br>· Invest in business development and export growth.<br>· Begin the creation of a long-term scheme to fund New Zealand Superannuation.<br>· Cut the cost of housing for low income families.<br>· Provide better funding to Plunket and the early childhood support programmes.<br>· Improve the quality of education at all levels.</p>

<p>&quot;It really is a matter of fairness. The gains from the economic changes of the last 15 years have gone overwhelmingly to the best off while ordinary families have seen the gaps widen.</p>
<p>&quot;In nine years of National Government, there have been three years in which the pension has been frozen. Per student spending in education has continued to fall while a whole range of social services for ordinary families have been stripped away or become more expensive.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour will start turning that around. We need to offer ordinary Kiwi families something better than the chance to buy shares in assets they already own.</p>
<p>&quot;We will offer real opportunity and security and we will do that in a fiscally responsible way. Our budgets, unlike Act&#39;s, do not depend on finding someone to pay $1200 million more for TVNZ than it is worth.</p>
<p>&quot;Nor are they threatened by Prime Ministerial fiscal slips like National&#39;s. They are solidly based and thoroughly costed,&quot; Dr Cullen said.</p>
