<p><strong>Wednesday, 10 November 1999, 1:37 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT Finance Spokesman Rodney Hide today said the Alliance budget would spell disaster for small businesses already under pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;Jim Anderton&#39;s budget is bad news for jobs and bad news for families.</p>
<p>&quot;Jim Anderton is hiking income tax up to a top rate of 47 cents in the dollar and bringing in a whole range of new taxes - land taxes, stamp duty, pollution taxes, Financial Transaction taxes and across the board tariffs. These extra costs will kill off business and jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;The job losses will hit families hard. They will also struggle because the price of all goods will jump 10% because of the Alliance tariff policy. The cost of everything will go up.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s dangerous nonsense from Jim Anderton to claim he will create 90,000 new jobs with his extremist tax, spend and bust policies.</p>
<p>&quot;Jim Anderton budgets on halving the cost of unemployment in three years. The only way this would happen is if hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders who wanted a job went to Australia because Jim Anderton with Labour would wreck job prospects here.</p>
<p>&quot;This Alliance budget is very damaging for Labour who cannot distance themselves from the extremist policies of the Alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;With the Alliance now positioned &#39;at the heart&#39; of a Labour Government today&#39;s budget will be very damaging to the centre-left vote,&quot; said Rodney Hide.</p>
