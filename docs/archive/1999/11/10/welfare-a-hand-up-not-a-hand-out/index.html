<p><strong>Wednesday, 10 November 1999, 1:33 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Wednesday 10th Nov 1999<br>Muriel Newman<br>Media Release -- Social Welfare</p>
<p>The welfare system has seriously weakened many families and made thousands of people dependent on the state. There are now families who have been dependent on welfare for three and four generations. Experience has shown that more welfare expenditure is simply not the answer. After pouring billions into the welfare system we have ended up with almost a quarter of all children in New Zealand growing up without the role model of a parent who works. ACT believes we must get to the heart of the problems and break the cycle of dependency. We must rebuild a society based on hard work, thrift and personal responsibility. We must create a truly compassionate welfare system that helps people regain independence, strengthening families and communities. ACT is the only Party that recognises welfare policy cannot be viewed in isolation. A strong and growing economy creates jobs and opportunities for New Zealanders who need them.</p>
<p>ACT’s goals - To build a society where everyone has the chance to participate and succeed. - To modernise the welfare state so it provides a hand up, not a hand out. Work for those who can work, security for those who can&#39;t - To ensure a strong, growing economy to lift the standard of living of all New Zealand families</p>
<p>ACT believes - Those that the state has made dependant, the state must help become independent - We must rebuild a stronger, safer New Zealand based on the values of hard work, thrift and personal responsibility by breaking the cycle of dependency - Government must ensure that those on welfare are helped and supported into work - Those who can work, should work. Those who can&#39;t work should be properly cared for - Every New Zealander must have the same opportunity to succeed</p>
