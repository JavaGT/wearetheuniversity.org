<p><strong>Friday, 26 November 1999, 12:04 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.labour.org.nz"><img src="http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg" alt="Labour 2000 web site"></a><br>Labour Leader Helen Clark today spent the last day of the election campaign reminding voters of the crucial importance of voting Labour on the party vote to ensure a change of government.</p>
<p>At a series of street corner meetings throughout Auckland, Helen Clark said that if voters wanted to get rid of National, then Labour needed a very strong level of support on the party vote.</p>
<p>&quot;After the last election, many people approached me to say they had wanted a change of government but had voted for parties other than Labour to provide us with a coalition partner.</p>
<p>&quot;The result? Three years of chaotic and disastrous National government propped up by a rag-tag mob of defectors and opportunists.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had three years of National clinging to power, but failing to govern; three more years of hand-off economic mismanagement; three more years of tax cuts for the well-off while New Zealand&#39;s public health system, our schools and universities, and our superannuitants suffered from cuts and under-funding.</p>
<p>&quot;National leaves behind it a stumbling economy, shattered public services, older people and families struggling to make ends meet, businesses closing, and public sector management which too often puts its own needs before service to our people.</p>
<p>&quot;If there has been a single dominant theme throughout this election campaign, it has been the widespread mood for a change and that it is time for a Labour-led government. That requires a strong level of support for Labour on the party vote.</p>

<p>&quot;Only a Labour-led government can lead the nation along the path of opportunity, security, and fairness, and to a new identity which defines us as a bold, innovative, energetic, and creative people. We don&#39;t just want to change the government. We want to change the direction of this country. We will govern for the many and not the few.</p>
<p>&quot;Only a strong party vote for Labour will ensure a change of government and allow us to begin rebuilding the economy, invest in the public health and education systems, bring back income-related rents for state house tenants, provide security for older New Zealanders in retirement, and begin closing the widening gaps between rich and poor.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand needs a new government which will restore integrity to the political process and usher in a new era of moderation, frugality and accountability. Labour needs a strong mandate from the voters to lead that fresh new government.</p>
<p>&quot;Voters who support Labour and want a strong Labour presence in the new government must give Labour their party vote,&quot; Helen Clark said.</p>
