<p><strong>Thursday, 11 November 1999, 2:49 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>

<p>Steve Maharey said the interest debt mountain was further evidence of how huge the burden of interest was on students. Since the student loan scheme began in 1992 - nearly quarter of a billion dollars of interest had been repaid.</p>
<p>&quot;It is figures like this that lead to Labour developing our policy of no interest on student loans while full-time and other low income students are still studying,&quot; Steve Maharey said.</p>
<p>&quot;While the Government figures have not differentiated between interest paid by students who are still studying and interest paid by former students, there is little doubt that Labour&#39;s policy will make a significant difference to these shocking debt levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Total student debt is more than $3.44 billion and growing. Yet the Government treats it as an asset!</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is totally committed to lowering the costs of tertiary education starting off with a fairer student loan scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;National on the other hand is refusing to acknowledge that interest is a problem. Instead it prefers to defend its lack of action on this issue by saying that providing interest relief would be unfair on the 30% of full-time students whose &#39;mums and dads can afford to pay for them&#39; while they are studying.</p>

<p>&quot;Labour says it is unfair to mortgage the lives of nearly 300,000 young New Zealanders when they are trying to get themselves an education. For example a former dental student - now working in the public health system, has such a huge loan that the compulsory repayments do not even cover the interest she is accruing and as a result she is leaving the public health system for a private practice,&quot; Steve Maharey said.  </p>
