<p><strong>Sunday, 14 November 1999, 5:11 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Sunday 14th Nov 1999</p>
<p>Richard Prebble</p>
<p>ACT Leader Hon Richard Prebble today set out ACT&#39;s vision for the economy with<br>the two key priorities to bring the top rate of tax down to twenty cents and to<br>cut red tape and compliance costs to businesses.</p>
<p>ACTÆs economic goals are:<br>- New Zealand to have the highest growth, and lowest unemployment, in the OECD,<br>and to have the highest living standards in the Asia-Pacific region and<br>- To foster wealth creation by reducing taxes and eliminating stifling<br>regulations</p>
<p>ACT believes</p>
<p>- Prosperity comes from an open economy, low spending and taxes, minimum<br>regulation, and honest and stable government</p>
<p>- Our tax system, Government red tape and bureaucracy are destroying far too<br>many jobs and businesses</p>
<p>&quot;After low flat tax, cutting red tape is the most important economic priority<br>to secure real job growth and keep New Zealand businesses competitive and<br>growing.</p>
<p>&quot;It is estimated that 2.5% of GDP goes on compliance costs - that&#39;s just form<br>filling and nonsense, a millstone around business&#39; neck, a drag on the economy<br>and costing us this year the equivalent of 23,000 people working full time just<br>to fill out tax forms alone.</p>
<p>&quot;In the 1990&#39;s, Government has hammered businesses with 5200 NEW laws and<br>regulations. 13% of average small business revenue is sucked into compliance<br>costs. And that&#39;s before you even take into account the impact of things like<br>the Employment Court.</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s shocking is that Government has no idea of what its regulations are<br>costing business. As a first step in a major assault on compliance costs and<br>red tape, ACT in Government will commission a study of the real cost of<br>compliance. We are also proposing a regulatory responsibility act to require a<br>proper cost-benefit study of all new legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;Cutting red tape and excess bureaucracy is essential to restoring our rural<br>profitability, to encouraging our entrepreneurs, to attracting investment and<br>most importantly, making New Zealand competitive and a country where businesses<br>want to stay and trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Infometrics has confirmed that ACT&#39;s programme of tax reductions to a low,<br>flat tax of twenty cents can be achieved in five years without cuts to<br>government services through restraint, not reduction in overall spending.</p>
<p>The IRD&#39;s own studies confirm that this will create 80,000 real, sustainable<br>new jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT is the only Party saying that it is the private sector, not government,<br>that grows the economy and that employs our people. The fundamental difference<br>between ACT and the left is that the jobs they claim their policies will<br>create are illusory and unsustainable. Tariffs, risky government make-work<br>schemes and trying to pick winners with handouts for business are all failed<br>policies of the past. The Left also want to let the government grow out of<br>control. Labour alone has promised 160 new Ministries, offices, funds and<br>quangos, and 97 inquiries.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour and the Alliance are refusing to listen to the businesses like Artel<br>Industries in Levin that are telling those parties that their plans to hike up<br>tax, re-nationalise ACC and repeal the Employment Contracts Act are threatening<br>thousands of real jobs up and down the country. At Artel alone, 380 jobs are<br>at risk if Labour and the Alliance become the Government.</p>
<p>&quot;Under the economic policies of Labour and the Alliance businesses will be<br>queuing up to buy a one-way ticket out of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Under ACT&#39;s economic policy, businesses will be queuing up to come home.</p>
<p>&quot;This week&#39;s National Business Review poll on the issues of most concern to<br>voters this election put the economy as number one. It is ACT&#39;s top priority<br>for the same reasons. We want New Zealand to be a strong, prosperous nation<br>that has the businesses and jobs to give our brightest young people every<br>reason to stay,&quot; said Hon Richard Prebble.</p>

<p>[Infometrics updated report on ACT&#39;s economic policy attached]</p>
<p><strong>Comparison of ACTÆs 3 November 1999 alternative Budget with InfometricsÆ<br>assessment of ACT tax policy prepared for the New Zealand EmployersÆ<br>Federation</strong></p>
<p>David Grimmond<br>Infometrics Ltd</p>
<p>On the information provided by ACT in their 3 November 1999 press release,<br>their fiscal projections for their alternative budget appear to be reasonable<br>and consistent with the assumptions that they have used.</p>
<p>The fiscal position forecast by ACT for 2004/05 in their ôalternative budgetö<br>is very similar to that modelled by Infometrics in its assessment of the ACT<br>PartyÆs tax policies as prepared for the New Zealand EmployersÆ Federation.<br>Both approaches result in Government spending less than 30% of GDP (our<br>assessment is 29.6% of GDP, ACTÆs 29.5% of GDP) and an operating surplus of<br>around $1.5 billion. The key difference is that the more aggressive spending<br>reduction assumed in the Infometrics report results in a lower net public debt<br>position.</p>
<p>By lowering government spending sooner plus receiving more revenue from asset<br>sales [1], the Infometrics projections accumulate $3.3 billion more in<br>operating surpluses than projected by ACT over the five year period. This<br>difference seems to be consistent with the different input assumptions used.<br>The ACT projections assume a $1.8 billion lower amount of revenue from asset<br>sales, and do not include the $1.25 billion in spending reductions assumed by<br>Infometrics to take place in 2000/01 and 2001/02. The remainder of the<br>difference is consistent with the compounded affect of carrying these expense<br>cuts forward in the following years.</p>
<p>[1] Infometrics assumed more asset sales but at very conservative prices.<br>Asset sales have an impact on the operating balance to the extent that the<br>Crown receives more (or less) than the assetÆs book value. Infometrics had<br>assumed a $3 billion boost to the operating balance over this period from asset<br>sales. The ACT numbers incorporate a $1.2 billion contribution from the sale<br>of TVNZ.  </p>
