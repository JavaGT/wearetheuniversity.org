<p><strong>Monday, 18 October 1999, 5:53 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>

2000 web site"></a>&quot;The only threat to New Zealanders&#39; ability to enjoy Christmas is a National-Act Government,&quot; Labour employment spokesperson Pete Hodgson said today.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s plans to attack New Zealanders&#39; holiday entitlements are not dead. They&#39;re not even sleeping. Jenny Shipley promised the National Party conference in July &quot;further action in the labour market.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s agenda is to allow annual and statutory holidays to be traded for cash. They will present it as a right but that is just cynical. For the most vulnerable workers there will be no choice.</p>
<p>&quot;Other &quot;reforms&quot; they have in mind are to introduce a six month probation period during which new workers can be sacked at will, to weaken the personal grievance provisions governing dismissals and to reduce the status of the Employment Court.</p>
<p>&quot;And that is just National on its own. Act would go further and scrap the minimum wage,&quot; Mr Hodgson said.</p>
<p>He was responding to a claim by Bill English that this would be the last happy Christmas for New Zealand families if a Labour Government was elected.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour will protect public holidays, introduce fairer industrial relations law, reverse National&#39;s pension cuts, restore affordable housing to low income families, reduce the debt burden on students, increase health spending and encourage innovative new businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;How Mr English can construe that as a recipe for misery - especially compared with the meanness of the last nine years - beats me,&quot; Mr Hodgson said.</p>
