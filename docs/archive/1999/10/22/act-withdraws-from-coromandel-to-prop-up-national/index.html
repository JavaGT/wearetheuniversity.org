<p><strong>Friday, 22 October 1999, 4:53 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT&#39;s withdrawal from Coromandel confirms the Right is running scared over Green support in the key seat, Green Party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said today.</p>
<p>ACT deputy leader Ken Shirley confirmed in The Waikato Times today that his party would not be standing a candidate in Coromandel in order to try to keep the right-wing vote from being split.</p>
<p>The admission comes three weeks after vehement denials from ACT leaders on the subject when the Green Party first publicised ACT&#39;s withdrawal.</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons said that ACT&#39;s decision not to stand a candidate in Coromandel was a two-for-one deal with National.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT stands aside in Coromandel and Tauranga, the two seats National is most worried about, and in return gets a free run at Wellington Central,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>When the Green Party first revealed ACT&#39;s withdrawal plans, a press release from ACT president Sir Roger Douglas said Ms Fitzsimons was &quot;talking utter nonsense about ACT&#39;s plans&quot; in Coromandel.</p>
<p>Late this afternoon, following ACT&#39;s admission, that press release was still sitting on ACT&#39;s Coromandel Electorate home-page.</p>
<p>&quot;It just shows - like I said three weeks ago - that ACT&#39;s right hand has no idea what it&#39;s far-right hand is doing,&quot; Ms Fitzsimons said.  </p>
