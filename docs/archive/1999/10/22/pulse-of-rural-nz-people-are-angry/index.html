<p>Friday 22nd Oct 1999</p>
<p>The real problem facing rural New Zealand is not enough profit for farming families and rural communities to live on.</p>
<p>This is the conclusion of the ACT farmer candidates at the end of an extensive two week tour today.</p>
<p>ACT rural spokesman Owen Jennings has led the Heartland Tour around rural communities in both the North and South Islands.</p>
<p>Speaking from Palmerston, where the ACT team held a farm meeting this afternoon, Mr Jennings said 80% of farming couples in North Otago have one or both partners working off farm because of declining profitability.</p>
<p>&quot;Rural New Zealand is desperate for leadership from government that will tackle the issue of profitability. It&#39;s an issue within the power of government to solve, because it&#39;s a problem caused by central and local government,&quot; Mr Jennings said.</p>
<p>&quot;Farmers can&#39;t be profitable while central and local government are giving them such a bad run. The issues of tax, local government costs, and unfair use of the Resource Management Act kept coming up time and time again during the Heartland Tour.</p>
<p>&quot;Here in Palmerston, farming families are fortunate to be able to get additional employment at Macrae&#39;s mine, but even this is under threat from environmental interests.</p>
<p>&quot;People are angry. They&#39;re prepared to deal with problems in market place but not when government ties their hands behind their back. Government must give them a fairer go, by easing up on taxes and rates and reforming the Resource Management Act so it can&#39;t be wilfully misused.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Jennings said the ACT team would make a public report on the state of rural New Zealand next week.  </p>
