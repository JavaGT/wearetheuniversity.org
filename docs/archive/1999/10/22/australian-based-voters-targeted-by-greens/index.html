<p><strong>Friday, 22 October 1999, 2:11 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>When New Zealand elects a new Government on November 27, votes from Kiwis living in Australia may nudge it in a Green direction.</p>
<p>The Green Party has been campaigning in Sydney and Melbourne in past months to pick up the votes of some of the 330,000 New Zealanders living in Australia.</p>
<p>This follows the novel and high-profile launch earlier this year of former Wellington City Councillor Celia Wade-Brown as the Green&#39;s list candidate in London.</p>
<p>Green Party Campaign Co-manager Christine Dann said that if people living overseas have been back to New Zealand in the past three years they are entitled to vote.</p>
<p>Ms Dann returned this week from a week-long trip to Sydney where she organised 10,000 leaflets to be distributed around &#39;kiwi-rich&#39; suburbs in Sydney and Melbourne and posters to be put up around parts of Sydney, including one saying, &#39;Kiwi voters enrol now to vote on November 27. Vote Green or the Kiwi&#39;s stuffed&#39;.</p>
<p>Green Party Justice Spokesperson Nandor Tanczos began the Green&#39;s trans-Tasman campaigning in August when he visited Melbourne and Tasmania.</p>
<p>The trips have been important in increasing an awareness of Green politics as a global movement, Ms Dann said.</p>
<p>New Zealanders are the largest group of foreigners migrating to New South Wales (19 per cent for the past three years).</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of them are young people who have left home to get a job, or a better job, or because they owe huge student debts,&quot; Ms Dann said.</p>
<p>&quot;We don&#39;t want them to abandon their home - we want them to use their vote to help make New Zealand a better place and to help elect a government which, with Green policies, can help put New Zealand back on track.&quot;</p>
