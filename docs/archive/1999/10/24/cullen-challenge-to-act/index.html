<p><strong>Sunday, 24 October 1999, 3:10 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.labour.org.nz"><img src="http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg" alt="Labour
2000 web site"></a>Labour deputy leader and finance spokesperson Michael Cullen has challenged Act to state exactly where it would make over $3 billion of savings in the major items of government spending to fund huge tax cuts for the rich.</p>
<p>&quot;Act has been trying to avoid the hard issues of government while turning itself into a New Zealand clone of the Pauline Hanson Party.</p>
<p>&quot;Now it is truth time. Mr Prebble tells us that if he were in a National led Government he would put tax on the Cabinet agenda every meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;It is now clear what that means. Act is proposing massive tax cuts to the wealthiest New Zealanders. For the Prime Minister, the tax cut would be about $280 in the hand a week. For a chief executive on $500,000 a year, the increase in take home pay would be $1155 a week.</p>
<p>&quot;People on- under $38,000 a year would get nothing extra. Absolutely zero.</p>
<p>&quot;But they would have to pay in one way or another for the huge tax cut for the rich. You can&#39;t nickel and dime over $3 billion in savings. It has to come from the big ticket items - health, education, superannuation, and benefits.</p>
<p>&quot;That means massive cuts in living standards for hundreds of thousands of ordinary New Zealanders. For example, if the savings all occurred in superannuation, it would require a slashing of the rates for a married couple by over $200 a week.</p>
<p>&quot;It is time for Mr Prebble to stop writing and start talking. He has a lot of explaining to do.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing in today&#39;s speech by Mr Prebble provides an explanation. It does nothing more than recycle the kind of clichés that even the National Party finds tired. Mr Prebble&#39;s &#39;middle New Zealand&#39; will find itself paying very much more for social services in order to fund big tax cuts for Mr Prebble&#39;s financial backers,&quot; Dr Cullen said.</p>
