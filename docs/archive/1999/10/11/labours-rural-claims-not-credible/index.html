<p><strong>Monday, 11 October 1999, 12:03 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Monday 11th Oct 1999<br>Richard Prebble<br>Media Release -- Other</p>
<p>ACT Leader Richard Prebble said claims by the Labour party to be able to represent the farmers of New Zealand were not credible. He said Jim Sutton&#39;s statement that a desire for change in rural communities will lead them to vote Labour was based on wishful thinking.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a desire for change, but not of the &#39;U-turn to the left&#39; variety,&quot; Mr Prebble said.</p>
<p>&quot;Heartland New Zealand recognises that government needs a gear change away from high taxes, high rates high compliance costs - and that only ACT offers such a gear change.&quot; Mr Prebble said it was laughable to think that the Labour party, whose candidates are overwhelmingly academics, teachers and unionists, could represent rural New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour only has two candidates who are farmers. By contrast ACT has more farmer candidates that National, Labour and the Alliance combined.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT farmer candidates are currently on a heartland tour of New Zealand, standing up for farmers who are being bankrupted by &#39;feel good&#39; laws, unnecessary red tape, bureaucracy and waste.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT says our farmers are the best in the world. The quickest way to correct the balance of payments, to restore rural towns, to get jobs is to restore the bottom line profitability of farming.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has declared on the West Coast that the heartland is surplus to requirements, that to quote Dr Cullen &quot;Labour values have moved on&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Only ACT is proud to say the values of heartland New Zealand - hard work, honesty, thrift and personal responsibility are the values of ACT. ACT is pleased and proud to be the party of heartland New Zealand,&quot; Mr Prebble said.</p>
