<p>Wellington Needs Effective Representation</p>

<p>SPEECH TO WELLINGTON CENTRAL CAMPAIGN LAUNCH Karori Community Recreation Centre Karori Road Wellington</p>
<p>1.00pm Saturday 30 October 1999 HON. RICHARD PREBBLE, MP LEADER OF ACT NEW ZEALAND</p>
<p>The Wellington Central electorate race is what voters wanted when they voted for MMP.</p>
<p>All three candidates in Wellington Central are MPs and are high on their party&#39;s list and so will be MPs.</p>
<p>The issue in Wellington Central is which MP will make the most effective representative for Wellington.</p>
<p>My two opponents are backbenchers who struggle to get reported. As a Party Leader, I am able to give any issue high public profile.</p>
<p>Wellington has needed a new hospital for over twenty years.</p>
<p>I have led the fight for a new tertiary hospital in Wellington City.</p>
<p>I have promoted Wellington as a tourism destination.</p>
<p>I am leading the debate on the need to stop the drift north of corporates.</p>
<p>I have protected funding for culture.</p>
<p>I obtained a loan for the new stadium.</p>
<p>While I have stopped the proposed major subdivision of the Town Belt, my major objective is to obtain reserve status for the Town Belt, Wellington&#39;s jewel.</p>
<p>As Leader of ACT, I am committed to the Transmission Gully project.</p>
<p>What is interesting about the issues, is that with the exception of Transmission Gully, that the Alliance and Labour have both opposed, all the other issues are now party political.</p>

<p>The issues just need stronger, effective, high profile representation which, as a Party Leader, I am uniquely qualified to provide.</p>
<p>I do ask the electorate to compare the record of representation between myself and my challengers.</p>
<p>In the year that Ms Hobbs has been the Labour candidate she has not achieved anything for the people of Wellington Central.</p>
<p>A check through the Hansard shows she hasn&#39;t raised a single issue affecting Wellington in Parliament.</p>
<p>Questions to Ministers reveal that in 12 months Ms Hobbs has made no representations on the hospital, the Town Belt, Transmission Gully, employment, education or any other issues.</p>
<p>Voters are entitled to ask, what has she done?</p>
<p>In the same time, I got a loan for the Stadium, saved the Thorndon Tennis Club, stopped a subdivision of the Town Belt, and got a decision for the go ahead of Wellington Hospital at the Newtown site.</p>
<p>When the issue is who is the most effective local MP, it&#39;s no contest - the answer is Richard Prebble.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
