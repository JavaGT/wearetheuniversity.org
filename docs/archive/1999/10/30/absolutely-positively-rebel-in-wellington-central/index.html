<p><strong>Saturday, 30 October 1999, 10:58 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels">Prebble&#39;s Rebels</a></strong></p>
<p>Nick Archer, President of Victoria University Prebble&#39;s Rebels, confirmed today that the Rebels will support Richard Prebble&#39;s re-election bid in Wellington Central.</p>
<p>Mr Archer said &quot;the Rebels will be doing the tasks which the mainstream campaign team cannot do. We will be throughout the electorate twenty-four hours a day, from now until November 27.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Archer said that the Rebels were known as the most active voluntary student political group at Victoria University, as well as being vocal campaigners for individual liberty, personal responsibility and the abolition of privilege.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been preparing our campaign for a long time. Our members are ready to hit the streets and spread the word. A swing to the left would have dire repercussions for young people - more government control over our lives, a return to Muldoonism and high taxes to punish ability and achievement.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The policies of Labour and Alliance would turn the brain drain into a flood, as graduates flee to countries which welcome excellence instead of punishing it with high taxes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Young people do not want ex-communist Marian Hobbs touching our economy everywhere in the hope that she can turn it on. Richard Prebble has a clear vision of our country, how young people can be rewarded for achievement and where nanny state has less control over our lives&quot; Mr Archer said.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
