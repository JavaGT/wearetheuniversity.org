<p>Alliance policy spells disaster for homeowners</p>
<p>Monday 4th Oct 1999<br>Muriel Newman<br>Media Release -- Social Welfare</p>
<p>ACT&#39;s Housing spokesperson Dr Muriel Newman said today &quot; the Alliance&#39;s housing policy spells disaster for the country&#39;s home owners and low income earners.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Alliance housing policy is a death knell for young first homeowners, and will drag down property values and destabilise this country&#39;s housing market.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The hardest hit will be those low income families who have struggled and saved to buy their own state house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The offer to build another one thousand state houses every year, is another example of the Alliance&#39;s extreme and ill-thought out policies. It may help the one thousand low income earners lucky enough to get a state house but what about the rest?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If someone is lucky enough to qualify for a state house, under Labour and the Alliance they will be able to rent the property for 25% of their income. Meanwhile their neighbour next door, who earns the same income but either wasn&#39;t lucky enough to get a state house or didn&#39;t have the right contacts, will have to pay much more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Owning your own home is the kiwi dream, but the Government remains the country&#39;s biggest Real Estate Agent with 60,500 state houses. The sooner the government moves out of home ownership the better - with the accommodation supplement to assist low income earners it doesn&#39;t matter whether the houses are owned by the private sector or the state. The policy is fair for all low income earners.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Low income earners, deserve equity and choice, not to be trapped by Labour and the Alliance&#39;s policies. We have seen the effects of income related rents before with the spiralling growth of state house ghettos - Labour and the Alliance should learn by their mistakes -not repeat them.&quot; said Dr Muriel Newman.</p>
