<p>Stuffed kiwi message to Nats and Labour</p>
<p>The Green Party today sent a stuffed toy kiwi to Labour Leader Helen Clark<br>and one to Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, saying they were symbols of the<br>fate of New Zealand&#39;s main icon under their governments&#39; policies.</p>
<p>The stuffed kiwis were sent to Ms Clark and Mrs Shipley as the Green Party<br>released its flagship conservation policy, with the main policy points<br>headed &#39;Saving the Kiwi... and a thousand other threatened species.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;Successive governments, by underfunding the Conservation Department, have<br>in effect stuffed the kiwi,&quot; Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said<br>today.</p>
<p>&quot;The Forest and Bird Protection Society is asking for just $10 million a<br>year for predator-free zones to stop the alarming death rate of our national<br>symbol,&quot; she said. &quot;But the Government has declined. Instead there was a<br>cut in conservation funding from $201.7 million in last year&#39;s budget to<br>$190.8 million this year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Meanwhile kiwi numbers in Northland, supposedly the last North Island<br>stronghold, dropped by 18 percent last year. Kiwi are breeding but there&#39;s<br>no systematic trapping or poisoning of stoats which are eating young kiwi as<br>fast as they hatch.&quot;</p>
<p>The Green Party has pledged to review conservation funding and priorities to<br>ensure the Conservation Department has the funds to do its job. The party<br>supports the establishment of &quot;mainland islands&quot; of predator free native<br>habitat to protect threatened species.</p>

<p>Ms Fitzsimons says the Green Party is the only one which would return native<br>birds to the forests, rather than protecting trees only.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government&#39;s own biodiversity strategy aims only to halt the decline of<br>threatened plants and wildlife. But under that policy threatened species<br>would remain threatened. The Greens want to go further. We want to restore<br>viable populations of plants and animals unique to New Zealand, so we can<br>take our children for a walk in the forest and see kaka and pigeons,&quot; she<br>said. &quot;We don&#39;t want these birds, or the kiwi, to be left as zoo exhibits.&quot;</p>
<p>* Jeanette Fitzsimons is in Auckland today and available for<br>interviews. She can be contacted on 025 586 068, 025 507183 or at the<br>Auckland Green Party office 09 336 1455.</p>
<p>* Ms Fitzsimons and Rod Donald MP, along with leading conservation<br>photographer and Green list candidate Craig Potton will launch the party&#39;s<br>flagship policy to supporters, environmentalists and the public during a<br>visual presentation by Mr Potton at Unitech&#39;s Blue Lecture Theatre,<br>Auckland, (entry from Gate 3, Carrington Rd), at 8pm today.</p>
