<p>MEDIA RELEASE - Available for Immediate Release</p>
<p>LABOUR&#39;S $1 A WEEK BRIBE FOR STUDENTS</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s election bribe to tertiary students is worth $1 a week according to Matthew Parkinson, National party East Coast candidate.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour said tax cuts to of up to $10 per week were worthless in the hands of hard working middle New Zealand families. The same party is now saying that interest repayment cuts of $1 a week to University students will make the world of difference&quot;.</p>
<p>Mr Parkinson made his comments after speeches in Parliament this morning confirmed the $1 a week figure. &quot;Labour wants to take money off hard working New Zealand families and give it to tertiary students. Graduates earn on average $525,000 over the course of their working lives than non-graduates. It just shows that National is the party that cares about hard working middle New Zealand families.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Parkinson said students also need to keep a critical eye on other Labour party promises that will affect their loan balance. &quot;Labour is also hiding the fact that their excessive spending promises will raise interest rates and will in fact increase the size of student loans. It gets worse. When those students establish their careers they are going to be further &quot;encouraged&quot; by facing higher tax rates&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The only students better off under the whole package Labour is proposing are those who stay at University forever or who finish their degree and drop out to go on the dole&quot;</p>
