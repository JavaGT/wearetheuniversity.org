<p><strong>Thursday, 7 October 1999, 12:05 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels">Prebble&#39;s Rebels</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT&#39;s Tertiary Education Policy was launched today in simultaneous ceremonies at Auckland University and on Prebble&#39;s Rebels&#39; internet site.</p>
<p>The policy was launched by Richard Prebble and ACT Education Spokesperson, Donna Awatere Huata, at midday. At the same time as the Auckland University launch the policy went live online at <a href="http://www.rebels.org.nz">http://www.rebels.org.nz</a>.</p>
<p>Prebble&#39;s Rebels are a free association of students who share a common belief in individual liberty, personal responsibility, individual autonomy and the abolition of privilege. With a nationwide membership base, the Rebels are well known for their outspoken libertarian views and radical activism.</p>
<p>Prebble&#39;s Rebels Webmaster, Gavin Middleton, said it was appropriate that the Rebels had a place in the launch.</p>
<p>&quot;Students from around the country have participated in every stage of the policymaking process. This policy has been written largely by students, for students, and it has the full support of the Rebels. By launching this policy on the internet, ACT is also acknowledging the important role information technology has in education&quot; Mr Middleton said.</p>
<p>Clint Heine, National Rebel President, said &quot;involving the Rebels in the policy launch reflects the important role of students in ACT. Many young people are drawn to the progressive new ideas of the ACT party, and the high quality of this policy will reflect their input and commitment.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Heine said &quot;The Rebels are pleased to be able to take part in the launch of a policy which will provide incentives for young people to undertake tertiary study and to remain in New Zealand after graduating.&quot;</p>
