<p>ACT’s Tertiary Policy</p>
<p>Thursday 7th Oct 1999<br>Richard Prebble<br>Speech -- Education</p>
<p>Speech to Auckland University 12.00 Thursday 7 October 1999</p>
<p>ACT’s tertiary policy is to change the present system to promote higher standards and to have a fair system.</p>
<p>Funding students rather than institutions will result in higher standards.</p>
<p>Students want degrees that are of an international standard. Too many courses at our universities are politically correct nonsense that students only do because they are forced to.</p>
<p>Like forcing commerce students to do the Marxist sociology courses. Or the proposal at Victoria University that all students be required to do Maori language courses.</p>
<p>If we fund students, not the institutions, then students will make their own choices about the qualifications that are best for their futures.</p>
<p>The present fee structure and student loan scheme is unfair.</p>
<p>The fee structure is unfair because students on the tuition fees are required to pay for the cost of university research. Over 40% of the cost of universities is research, so the overall claim by the university of the fee cost for courses is 40% too high.</p>
<p>ACT says that university research is a public good and should be paid for out of general taxation.</p>
<p>ACT’s proposal will see many very expensive course fees drastically reduced.</p>
<p>The second unfairness is in the student loan scheme.</p>
<p>ACT supports a student loan scheme because without it students from poor families could not attend university or polytech.</p>

<p>The scheme is unfair because students who borrow loans are required to not only pay back their loan but also the loans of students who default.</p>
<p>So students who work hard, get a job, and start repaying their loans are paying for others who don&#39;t.</p>
<p>ACT asks why should students who borrow the old fashion way and repay their loan have to pay for those who do not. It&#39;s simply not fair.</p>
<p>50 percent of all students have no student loan so they pay nothing towards the cost of defaulting students.</p>
<p>The student loan is a government scheme and the government should pick up the cost of defaults.</p>
<p>This change will reduce the total cost of the average student loan by a third.</p>
<p>ACT is opposed to the Labour proposal to make student loans interest free while students are at University. 50% of all students have no loan. The average loan is $12,000.</p>
<p>If loans were interest free every student should borrow to the limit, if only to put the money in the savings bank at 6%.</p>
<p>Many students will borrow intending to put it in the bank.</p>
<p>Labour’s proposal will see student loan debt explode.</p>
<p>Labour intends continuing with the scheme where by the students who repay pay for those who default. So most students will end up much worse off.</p>
<p>ACT is opposed to Labour’s proposal to cut off entry to courses that Labour does not like and to direct you to courses that they think students should study.</p>
<p>ACT says that students can make better decisions about their own lives than politicians.</p>
<p>Students on this campus voted to give each student the right to choose whether or not to join their student association. ACT firmly believes that they should have that choice.</p>
<p>ACT also says students are the best judges of what courses they wish to study.</p>
<p>If studying science was a guarantee of success then the Soviet Union would have won the cold war.</p>
<p>ACT is also opposed to racial quotas.</p>
<p>Students should be selected into courses because they qualify.</p>
<p>It is wrong for Auckland University Medical School to be telling a New Zealand born student that he or she cannot study medicine because he is of Indian origin.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as positive discrimination. If one person is positively discriminated against it follows that someone else was negatively discriminated against.</p>
<p>ACT is the party of equal opportunity. ACT is the party that believes in freedom and personal responsibility.</p>
<p>ACT is the party of the future, your future. Our policies are for your whole life, not just your student life.</p>
