<p><strong>Thursday, 7 October 1999, 10:57 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels">Prebble&#39;s Rebels</a></strong></p>
<p>Students occupying the registry building at Victoria University should have power and water cut off, and should be evicted by police if they refuse to leave, according to the Victoria University President of Prebble&#39;s Rebels and Executive-elect member of the Victoria University of Wellington Students Association (VUWSA), Nick Archer.</p>
<p>Mr Archer pointed out that previous occupations of the registry building have led to allegations of vandalism and theft being laid against student activists.</p>
<p>Last night Nick Archer and Philip Rennie, another VUWSA Executive-elect member and chair of Wellington&#39;s Young Nationals, went to the registry to speak to students but were ejected from the building and verbally abused by protestors.</p>
<p>&quot;As elected executive members we speak for students even more than the self-appointed professional protestors who occupy the registry building. By throwing us out they showed what contempt they hold for the real student voice&quot; Mr Archer said.</p>
<p>&quot;This militant minority clearly do not speak for the vast majority of students at Victoria University.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Archer said that there were only about 50 protestors in the registry and over 14,950 students who were not supporting the occupation. He also pointed out that any rise in Victoria University&#39;s fees had not been decided yet.</p>
<p>&quot;The protestors were planning to march to parliament yesterday, but occupied the registry building instead. These fairweather protestors either decided to pursue their socialist dreams away from yesterday&#39;s light rain, or they proved that they are very bad at geography&quot; Mr Archer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The protestors are demanding free education - they don&#39;t want to pay for the classes they don&#39;t attend because there are drinking games going on in the registry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The protestors are claiming a right to make every worker in the country subsidise their law, science and arts degrees through higher taxes&quot; Mr Archer said.</p>
