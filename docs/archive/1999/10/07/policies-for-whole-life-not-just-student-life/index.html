<p>Policies for Your Whole Life, Not Just Student Life</p>
<p>Thursday 7th Oct 1999<br>Richard Prebble<br>Media Release -- Education</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand today released its tertiary policy at a forum of Auckland University students with ACT Education Spokesman Donna Awatere Huata and Leader Hon Richard Prebble outlining how ACT&#39;s policies would help students now and in the future.</p>
<p>Donna Awatere Huata said her Party was determined to lift the quality and standard of education from pre-school right through high school to give more New Zealanders the skills to take on tertiary study.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT will close the rapidly widening gap between the number of students from poor schools going on to University compared to the number from wealthy areas. Tertiary education is slipping out of the grasp of children from low income families because they are not being taught either at home or at school that they can succeed.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT is committed to protecting every child&#39;s right to excellence in education.</p>
<p>&quot;For students currently enrolled in tertiary study the policy we are releasing today will help them succeed now and in the future. We have a positive vision for tertiary education based on equity, excellence and choice. It gives the power to students and will ease their financial burden both now and when they begin their careers.</p>
<p>&quot;High tax is the real student debt. Labour and the Alliance are promising students a cheap education now, but they will tax graduates into the ground for the rest of their lives. ACT believes those who work hard, get their qualifications and get jobs should keep more of what they earn each week. ACT&#39;s policies will keep our talented graduates in New Zealand.</p>

<p>&quot;We want a strong, growing economy that is creating job opportunities for graduates so they don&#39;t have to go overseas.</p>
<p>&quot;This policy is not for student activists or student unions. This policy is for the majority of students who are studying to get an education, get ahead and get a job. It is about helping them now and in the future to succeed and keep New Zealand moving forward,&quot; said Donna Awatere Huata.</p>
