<p>Greens issue two-tier welfare policy</p>
<p>Benefit stand-down periods and differential youth rates must be abolished, as part of an overhaul of the Social Welfare system, the Green Party says.</p>
<p>Green Party Enterprise, Employment and Income Support spokesperson Sue Bradford said the benefit system had to be simplified with a two-tier system of income support.</p>
<p>There should be one base-benefit level across all types of income support, and a second tier of add-ons for each child or specific need, such as disability, she said.</p>
<p>Youth rates had to go.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes no economic, dietary, or human sense to tell someone aged under 24 that they need less money to live on than the rest of us - anyone who is feeding and clothing growing teenagers or young adults will confirm this.&quot;</p>
<p>The Green Party supported a reduction in state housing rental levels to 25% per cent of family income.</p>
<p>The party has also pledged to investigate resuming the universal child benefit.</p>
<p>&quot;It is one of the silent tragedies of our time that the only income a mother controlled for herself and her child was allowed to slip away,&quot; Ms Bradford said.</p>
<p>The work-for-the-dole scheme - &quot;which punishes people for the crime of being unemployed,&quot; Ms Bradford said - should be abolished.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time we stopped treating hundreds of thousands of adults and children as third-class citizens, and worked together in a truly socially responsible society.</p>
<p>&quot;Too much time is spent on arguing about who deserves what and administering complex social welfare schemes. We need something which everyone understands and is simple to administer.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Bradford discussed Green social welfare policies at a Social Policy Forum in Milford, Auckland, yesterday which raised money for the Auckland City Mission.</p>
