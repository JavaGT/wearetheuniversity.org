<p><strong>Tuesday, 12 October 1999, 2:21 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>“University councils attempts to silence students by placing fee setting during exam time has not succeeded” said Karen Skinner Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>Two more campus’s are today taking action against growing student fees and debt. At Auckland, students have smashed a ‘wall of debt’ and are now occupying part of their University. At Otago students will be ‘attending’ their University council meeting at 2pm.</p>
<p>“Our fight is not just with the University, but with the government who has continually failed to deal with the growing tertiary education crisis” said Ms Skinner. “Jenny Shipley and the National party have created a debt time bomb. Young people are beginning to suffer the consequences.”</p>
<p>“We challenge Jenny Shipley and Max Bradford to tell the public when they project that the level of student debt will stop growing. Student debt is currently at over $3 billion. How much do we have to owe before the government will admit that the scheme is out of control and increase funding to our Universities?” concluded Ms Skinner.</p>
