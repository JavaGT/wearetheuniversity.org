<p><strong>Tuesday, 12 October 1999, 4:42 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>

<p>Jenny Shipley has painted a far too rosy picture from the latest crime statistics, Labour police spokesperson George Hawkins said.</p>
<p>&quot;While any reduction in reported crime is to be welcomed, a closer examination of the figures reveals some disturbing facts.</p>
<p>&quot;Violent crime has increased slightly with 40,274 recorded offences, and makes up a higher percentage of overall crime.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s been a massive 20.8% increase in reported violent crime in Northland, an 11.8% increase in Tasman and a 6% increase in Canterbury.</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs Shipley claims that &quot;while others talk, National delivers.&quot; How then does she explain a 93% increase in violent offences between June 1990 and June 1999? Under National, New Zealand has become a far more violent society.</p>
<p>&quot;National has also failed to deliver on its promise to tackle the public&#39;s number one crime concern - burglary. The burglary resolution rate has fallen even further, to just 11.1 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;A slight reduction in reported burglaries is no comfort. Police National Headquarters has estimated that only 55 percent of burglaries are reported to the police - many only because of insurance requirements. The public know that in most cases the police don&#39;t have the resources to help them.</p>
<p>&quot;This is reflected in a drop in public satisfaction with Police services, from 80% to 74%. The percentage of people with full trust and confidence in our police force has fallen to just 19%.</p>
<p>&quot;While individual police officers continue to do a wonderful job, government stuff-ups like the INCIS debacle and the cost-cutting police review have been major handicaps.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour will tackle crime, especially youth offending and burglary, and is committed to restoring the morale of our police and the public&#39;s faith in them,&quot; George Hawkins said.</p>
