<p>Hon Max Bradford<br>Minister for Tertiary Education</p>
<p>MEDIA RELEASE<br>October 31, 1999</p>
<p>More Student Debt Under Labour</p>
<p>It is a sign of panic when Labour MPs try and make a story out of back-of-the envelope guesswork, Tertiary Education Minister Max Bradford said today.</p>
<p>Mr Bradford was responding to Labour education spokesman Steve Maharey&#39;s comments on a speculative media article about future student loan interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has announced changes that will effectively cut interest rates from the current 7% to 5.7% next year for students who are studying.</p>
<p>&quot;The future course of student loan interest rates will be determined by the next government.</p>
<p>&quot;The National party has already announced the formula for setting annual rates is under review,&quot; Mr Bradford said.</p>
<p>This was announced in the Bright Future Package on August 18.</p>
<p>&quot;Until the reviews of the formula and the interest rate are complete, claims that rates will go up or down are pure speculation.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s policy of removing all interest on student loans while studying would see debt skyrocket. Students would hardly say no to a free loan and would end up borrowing more.</p>
<p>&quot;And what is more, once students start full-time jobs many would face higher taxes as a reward for their hard work.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s policy would allow most students to repay loans only one or two years earlier, but they would have to pay higher taxes for the rest of their lives,&quot; Mr Bradford said.  </p>
