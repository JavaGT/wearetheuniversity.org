<p><strong>Friday, 15 October 1999, 12:14 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>“National’s commitment to crime reduction is paying local dividends, and the Shipley administration will continue to ensure our streets and communities are safer,” said National’s Ilam MP Gerry Brownlee today.</p>
<p>Mr Brownlee’s comments follow the release of crime statistics that show New Zealand’s crime rate has dropped for the second year in the row, down 3% in the year to June 1999.</p>
<p>Canterbury received some very favourable news. As well as total offences falling by 2%, some key offences were well down on last year’s figures.</p>
<p>Dishonesty offences were down 5%, drug and anti-social offences were down 7.3%, and property abuse offences were down 5.9%.</p>
<p>“National’s four-point plan to tackle crime is working. We will continue to focus on early intervention, crime prevention, more police, and tougher sentences.”</p>
<p>Mr Brownlee said surveys that show New Zealanders believe crime is increasing go against with what’s really happening. Not only has the overall crime rate been reducing since 1992, but the rate of violent crime nation-wide has also declined over the past four years.</p>
<p>“The public should feel reassured. Thanks to the Government’s crime reduction programme and the Police’s hard work Canterbury is a safer place.”</p>
<p>He said by the middle of next year New Zealand will have nearly 7,000 sworn police officers – the highest number in the county’s history. In contrast, police numbers reduced by 270 under the previous Labour Government.</p>
