<p>&quot;An overwhelming feeling following last night&#39;s debate is how badly Richard Prebble performed,&quot; Marian Hobbs said.</p>
<p>&quot;He lied about how much Act&#39;s tax policies would affect the provision of health and education. He insulted students by implying that they would rip the student loan system off if they were given half a chance. Students go to university to get an education so they can get a decent job - they don&#39;t go to make money.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite being a seasoned politician, Mr Prebble clearly let Winston Peters rattle him and was unable to articulate anything very clearly. It will be a real dampener for Act as they prepare to launch their Wellington Central campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;By contrast, I am offering articulate, strong advocacy for Wellington Central and will be clear and focused on issues like schooling and health provision.</p>
<p>&quot;The contest for Wellington Central is clearly between me and Richard Prebble and if the leaders&#39; debates continue in the same vein they will be of more help to me than Mr Prebble,&quot; Marian Hobbs said.  </p>
