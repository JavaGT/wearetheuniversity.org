<p><strong>Thursday, 28 October 1999, 12:23 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Education is the key to advancement at all levels in society. The state education system, however, is seriously under-performing. Government monopoly has caused too many young New Zealanders to leave school ill-equipped to develop their full potential. The personal and social consequences are immense. ACT will put the focus on students where it belongs. School choice can change incentives, empower parents, enable talented teachers to be rewarded and give students a greater opportunity to succeed.</p>
<p>ACT’s goals</p>
<p>Every child to arrive at school ready to learn<br>Every child to have access to competent schooling<br>Every child to learn to read, write and do maths<br>New Zealand to be in the top five countries in the world in reading, mathematics and science<br>Students and parents empowered through real choice</p>
<p>ACT believes</p>
