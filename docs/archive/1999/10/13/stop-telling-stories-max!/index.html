<p><strong>Wednesday, 13 October 1999, 2:42 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>

<p>&quot;Mr Bradford&#39;s comments to Canterbury University students were a mixture of distortions and half truths,&quot; Steve Maharey said.</p>
<p>&quot;No wonder he gets mobbed when he is telling students such rubbish.</p>
<p>&quot;I can see Mr Bradford&#39;s problem - he has no policy. After nine long years of a National Government, the problems in the tertiary sector are so big that even Mr Bradford has acknowledged the need for change.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has spent millions of taxpayers&#39; dollars over the past two years on reviews and white papers which it now wants to bury.</p>
<p>&quot;In the absence of any forward looking policy Mr Bradford is attacking Labour. We are happy to be the centre of attention because our policies have been very well received.</p>
<p>&quot;No wonder. Labour&#39;s policies give the tertiary sector a sense of direction, new investment in teaching and research, addresses equity issues, and is committed to making tertiary education affordable to students.</p>
<p>&quot;Our loans policy has been a hit because it will remove interest on loans while students are studying and assist them to pay off their debts.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Bradford can try all he wants to mislead people about Labour&#39;s policies but the fact is they are well understood and will help ensure Labour wins the next election,&quot; Steve Maharey said.</p>
