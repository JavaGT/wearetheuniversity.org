<p><strong>Friday, 1 October 1999, 3:49 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Long distance runner, Seigfried Bauer must be hugely relieved that the Alliance<br>cancelled its plan to have him running to highlight their spending promises.</p>
<p>ACT Finance Spokesman Rodney Hide said the Alliance&#39;s six billion-dollar<br>spending plan would have seen the long distance runner face the greatest<br>challenge of his career, circumnavigating the globe.</p>
<p>&quot;If you laid the 300 million $20 notes end to end that Jim Anderton wants to<br>spend, they would go right around the globe</p>
<p>&quot;The issue of job creation and business growth is extremely serious for New<br>Zealand. Taxing hard working New Zealanders and their businesses into the<br>ground costs jobs and thousands of them.</p>
<p>&quot;Jim Anderton&#39;s $20 vision for New Zealanders who are out of work and need jobs<br>is a disgrace. They deserve real jobs. ACT wants to help people off welfare<br>and into real jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT&#39;s economic policies are about strong businesses and creating jobs. That<br>is why ACT&#39;s policies are recognised as being the best policies for the<br>economy, for jobs and for growth,&quot; said Rodney Hide.</p>
