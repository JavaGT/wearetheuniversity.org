<p><strong>Friday, 1 October 1999, 7:16 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.labour.org.nz"><img src="http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg" alt="Labour
2000 web site"></a><br>The first anniversary today of the Hikoi of Hope is a chance for the Government to reflect on the failure of the social policies that thousands marched against, says Labour social welfare spokesperson Steve Maharey.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year Jenny Shipley hid in her office when thousands gathered at Parliament to tell her &#39;enough is enough&#39;. She didn&#39;t listen then, and she&#39;s not listening now.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour supported the aims of the hikoi. We&#39;ve been listening to New Zealanders and we have the policies to address the concerns they brought to Wellington.</p>
<p>&quot;The hikoi asked for real jobs and Labour will ensure that unemployed people can get the skills they need for work, rather than bullying them with the failed &#39;community wage&#39; scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;It asked for a public health system New Zealanders can trust, and Labour will deliver a system built on co-operation rather than competition, with elected instead of appointed health boards.</p>
<p>&quot;It asked for benefit and wage levels that move people out of poverty. Labour will deliver a flexible benefit system that tailors support to need, while the repeal of the Employment Contracts Act will end the drift to insecure low-wage jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;It asked for affordable housing, and Labour will deliver state housing with rents pegged to income, not market forces.</p>
<p>&quot;It asked for accessible education, and Labour is committed to cutting the costs to students of tertiary education, starting with a fairer loans scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;By tragic coincidence today is also the first anniversary of the formation of Work and Income NZ, one of the Government&#39;s biggest social policy disasters.</p>
<p>&quot;The culture of extravagance in Winz has made a laughing-stock of a vital public service. Even worse, we&#39;re seeing long-term unemployment increase while successful subsidised work schemes like Taskforce Green and Job Plus are cut back.&quot;</p>
