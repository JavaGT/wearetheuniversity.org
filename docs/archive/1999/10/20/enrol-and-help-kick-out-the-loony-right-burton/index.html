<p><strong>Wednesday, 20 October 1999, 11:15 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.labour.org.nz"><img src="http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg" alt="Labour

<p>&quot;Voting is the only way New Zealanders can make their loathing clear for the corrupt, self-serving, unprincipled, student-hating, Maori-bashing, money-grubbing government a National-Act coalition would produce,&quot; Mr Burton says.</p>
<p>He was reacting to the news today that 340,000 eligible voters have just one more week to enrol to vote in this year&#39;s election.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who hasn&#39;t enrolled should consider for a second that they might be saying yes by default to Richard Prebble as Deputy Prime Minister,&quot; Mr Burton says.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone who wants to get rid of Prebble, Rodney Hide, Max Bradford and Tony Ryall has to enrol to get the chance.</p>
<p>&quot;Failing to vote is one way of saying yes to an extreme right government that would make the present nest of snakes and party-hoppers look tame.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the chance, National and Act together would sell your holidays, trash the few employment rights you still have, flog off the last remaining public assets and distribute the profits amongst their rich mates.</p>
<p>&quot;The mood for change in New Zealand is clear, but people must vote to make their voice heard. I strongly urge anyone who hasn&#39;t enrolled to do so before it&#39;s too late.&quot;  </p>
