<p><strong>Thursday, 21 October 1999, 12:15 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT Finance spokesman Rodney Hide said today that the Pre-Election Fiscal Update revealed the disastrous effect Winston Peters&#39; spend-up has had on New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;The incoming government in 1996 was looking forward to solid growth, falling unemployment and large and sustainable budget surpluses. The rosy forecast was set out in the 1996 Pre-Election Fiscal Update.</p>
<p>&quot;The foolish Coalition spend-up combined with the Asian downturn plunged the economy into recession and cost thousands of New Zealanders their jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand has an extra 20,000 unemployed, government is spending an extra $50 a week per household, a $6.4 billion surplus has been entirely evaporated, and New Zealanders have lost out on $3,000 of annual income that should have been theirs. That&#39;s what comparing this election&#39;s Fiscal Update with that from the last election reveals. Lax fiscal control means taxpayers are having to spend an extra $450 million this year financing government debt.</p>
<p>&quot;This PREFU compared to that of 1996 shows the absolute foolhardiness of Labour and the Alliance&#39;s policy of massively higher spending. Winston&#39;s spend-up was hard on New Zealanders. Labour and Alliance&#39;s even bigger spend-up would be an absolute disaster.</p>
<p>What government needs is a dose of fiscal reality. We need taxpayers keeping more of what they earn and getting real value for money for what government spends.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT is pleased to see that the government has cut back on its &quot;slush fund&quot; for &quot;future initiatives&quot;. When ACT first started protesting about government setting aside taxpayers&#39; money for unidentified projects the fund was $800 million cumulative a year. Under pressure from ACT it has been pulled down to $500 million. That&#39;s a saving for taxpayers of $1,800 million over three years. That&#39;s a good start for once again establishing fiscal discipline,&quot; said Rodney Hide.</p>
