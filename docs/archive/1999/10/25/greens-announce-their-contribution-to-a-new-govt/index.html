<p>Greens announce their contribution to a new government</p>
<p>Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons today announced nine policies the Green Party expects to contribute to a Labour-led government following the November 27 election.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Green Party&#39;s national launch at the Marine Rescue Centre in Auckland this afternoon, Ms Fitzsimons said: &quot;New Zealanders need a vision and practical leadership and the Greens can provide both. There are a number of unique contributions we would hope and expect to make to a Labour-led government. They are the practical, achievable steps voters can expect if they give us their support.&quot;</p>
<p>The steps are:</p>
<p>* A halt to genetic engineering: No further approvals to genetic engineering field trials or releases until the findings of the Royal Commission have been studied and implemented.</p>
<p>* Go organic: An advisory service for growers, the changing of research objectives for the Public Good Science Fund and a mortgage guarantee scheme for those wanting to convert their farms.</p>
<p>* Stop the logging: An immediate cancellation of all the West Coast timber contracts that have been signed in a deliberate attempt to tie the hands of a future government, and a renegotiation of those pre-existing signed earlier in good faith. Pine should be made available for processing on the coast instead.</p>
<p>* Energy Efficiency: Communities, businesses, local government and citizens groups could be discussing their part in NZ&#39;s energy strategy within a few months and the first energy performance standards could be in place in a year.</p>
<p>* More funding for conservation: In the first budget we would argue strenuously for increased funding for DOC, especially for pest control to protect threatened species.</p>
<p>* Sustainable transport: A significant shift of funding from new roading to public transport and a reduction of car dependency in cities.</p>
<p>* Ecological tax reform: We need a shift in what we tax - away from goods like work, income and enterprise and on to bads like waste, pollution and toxics.</p>
<p>* Alternatives to prisons: An end to building more prisons and a commitment to habilitation and restorative justice.</p>
<p>* Sustaining fishing communities: A publicly funded multi-stakeholder process for fisheries management.</p>
<p>&quot;Because we are appalled at growing poverty alongside a grossly rich elite; because we want to ensure decent housing, a public health system, stop the punitive work-for-the-dole, and lighten the burden of student loans we have made it clear that we will not support a National-Act government,&quot; Ms Fitzsimons said.</p>
