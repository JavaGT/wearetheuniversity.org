<p>Press Release</p>
<p>For Immediate Release</p>
<p>Tuesday 4 October 1999</p>
<p>Call for Vice Chancellor&#39;s spending to be brought to account</p>
<p>&quot;Students are being ripped off by the University of Canterbury&#39;s Vice Chancellor Daryl Le Grew&#39;s spending. I have asked Max Bradford the Minsiter of Tertiary Education to call for an investigation into the expenditure,&quot; National&#39;s Youth Vice President Daniel Gordon said today.</p>
<p>Daniel Gordon said Mr Le Grew has proposed a massive fee increase for next year, which equals a 45 percent average fee increase across the University as a whole.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no need to raise fees. Government funding has increased not decreased. National has continued its funding commitment to the students of the University of Canterbury. Last year&#39;s Government grant was $77.5 million an increase of $2.3 million on 1997 funding levels.</p>
<p>&quot;The justification for the fee increase is so Mr Le Grew can lavishly upgrade the Registry to the tune of $12 million, build up the cash reserves, and apparently carry out a string of other capital expenditure - including building a new student services building at a cost estimated between $2 to 5 million. Mr Le Grew, apparently late last year, authorised a lavish upgrade of the Vice Chancellor&#39;s floor in the Registry to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;The University of Canterbury seems content on penalising students and charging extra unnecessary fees so it can advance lavish building and refurbishment programmes. Such programmes only advantage upper management and are not essential for student services. When a new building is completed it is generally over the top and way over budget - the Commerce Building is a prime example.&quot;</p>
<p>Daniel Gordon said the sort of irresponsible spending demonstrates the need for Mr Le Grew to be called to account and to be investigated by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Le Grew has demonstrated his inability to work within a set budget - the unfortunate thing is that students will lose out,&quot; Daniel Gordon said.</p>
