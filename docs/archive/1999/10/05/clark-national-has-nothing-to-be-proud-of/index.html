<p><strong>Tuesday, 5 October 1999, 3:32 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>

2000 web site"></a>Labour Leader Helen Clark said today that reports that many children have been turning up to school with empty bellies confirm the utter failure of the National Party’s policies.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister has glibly asserted that ‘New Zealanders…are proud of what we have done.’</p>
<p>“Which New Zealanders is Mrs Shipley talking about? The families mired in poverty and unable to feed their school-age children adequately, as 50 percent and more of their income goes to pay market rentals on state houses?</p>
<p>“What about the tens of thousands of New Zealanders unemployed, or stuck on waiting lists for operations in public hospitals?</p>
<p>“Or was Mrs Shipley referring to the university students who under Mrs Shipley’s government have accumulated a crippling burden of debt?</p>
<p>“Whichever way you look at it, the record of Mrs Shipley and her government stinks.</p>
<p>“Far from being proud of what National has delivered, New Zealanders are demanding a complete change in the direction of economic and social policy. It’s time for a fresh start.</p>
<p>“With Mrs Shipley’s rag tag coalition now limping towards defeat, only Labour is in a position to deliver this change.</p>
<p>“Labour’s policies will reinvigorate the economy and restore a decent level of public services. That’s something we can all be proud of,” Helen Clark said.</p>
