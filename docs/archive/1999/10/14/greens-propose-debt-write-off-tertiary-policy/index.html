<p>Green Party proposes debt write-off scheme in Tertiary Education Policy</p>
<p>The Green Party, launching its Tertiary Education policy today, supports writing off students&#39; education debts in return for a &quot;commitment to New Zealand society&quot; from them.</p>
<p>According to the OECD, New Zealand is still short of a level of participation in tertiary studies that would match the ambitions of a knowledge-intensive, high-skills economy.</p>
<p>Green Party Tertiary Education spokesperson Michael Tritt said today that for New Zealand to progress towards the much talked about knowledge economy the user-pays system, which discourages participation, must be rejected. Tertiary education was vital to our future prosperity, he said.</p>
<p>Mr Tritt said that the write-off scheme would see one year&#39;s full-time commitment (35 hours a week) from a student enabling one year&#39;s fee for fulltime study, including interest and living cost debts, to be written off. The commitment could be either paid work, raising a family, caring for elders or voluntary work.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re saying it is a student&#39;s choice what they do. As long as they are making a positive commitment to New Zealand we support writing off their debt.</p>
<p>&quot;A generation has had its future compromised by a short-sighted, uncaring and economically senseless government policy. Student debt has reached crisis level and the debt burden is a wrong that must be corrected,&quot; Mr Tritt said.</p>
<p>The Green Party supports capping fulltime student fees at $1500 and then progressively phasing them and the loan scheme out over time. The Green Party would also apply immediately a real interest rate of zero to student loans. The loans would be adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p>Access to publicly funded education would depend on academic progress.</p>
<p>The Green Party supports the introduction of a universal student allowance for fulltime students, at the level of the unemployment benefit, and tax write-offs of study costs for part-time students.</p>
<p>Mr Tritt and Green Party Co-Leader Rod Donald release the policy today at 1pm at the University of Otago&#39;s Union.</p>
