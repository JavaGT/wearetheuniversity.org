<p><strong>Thursday, 14 October 1999, 1:53 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>&quot;Action taken by Auckland and Otago medical students will again highlight the huge societal cost of increasing fees and growing student debt&quot; said Karen Skinner Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>&quot;National has created a time bomb, the full effects of which are yet to be felt. Students may be accumulating debt now – but it is the public who will suffer the consequences in the long-run.</p>
<p>&quot;The National government has been completely irresponsible with their failure to assess or monitor the effect, or potential impact on our society of the student loan scheme and skyrocketing debt.</p>
<p>&quot;Every student who graduates with a huge debt will be forced to make life decisions based on their financial situation. This means that they will be forced to pursue jobs based on the salary or will increase user-charges to the public.</p>
<p>&quot;Those people unable to pay the inevitable increasing user-charges will be unable to access vital services. Today medical students are highlighting this issue in the health sector, but the problem extends to other areas for example legal advice or counselling.</p>
<p>&quot;The government will eventually have to pay for this debt as well. For example teachers, nurses and other public servants will have to demand higher pay to cover their debt repayments.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand needs a government who will take positive action in the tertiary sector before it is too late. We need National out&quot; concluded Ms Skinner.</p>
