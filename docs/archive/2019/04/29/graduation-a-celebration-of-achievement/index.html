<p><strong>Monday, 29 April 2019, 3:20 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>Honorary doctorates for Synlait co-founder John Penno and naturalist Hugh Wilson will be among nearly 600 awards presented at the 2019 Lincoln University Graduation on May 3.</p>
<p>The ceremonies will also feature posthumous awards to two victims of the Christchurch terror attacks, as well as a student who died in an accident last year.</p>
<p>Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor Bruce McKenzie said the graduation was a celebration of students’ hard work and achievements, and that included the posthumous awards.</p>
<p>“This occasion, while recognising the tragic circumstances surrounding the loss of those graduates is also about acknowledging their efforts and their time here, as well as the students who were their peers.”</p>
<p>Around 570 students will be receiving certificates, diplomas and degrees in morning, (10am) and afternoon (2pm) ceremonies at the Lincoln Events Centre.</p>
<p><strong>Awards</strong><br><strong><em>Honorary Doctorates</em></strong><br>• Dr John Penno is a primary sector business leader, co-founding the then dairy farming and now dairy manufacturing company Synlait Milk in 2000. He was directly responsible for leading Synlait Milk’s strategy development, business development and financial management.
