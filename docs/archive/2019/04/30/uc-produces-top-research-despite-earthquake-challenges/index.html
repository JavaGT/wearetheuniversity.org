<p><strong>Tuesday, 30 April 2019, 5:38 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>The University of Canterbury (UC) continues to produce top quality research despite challenges resulting from the Canterbury earthquakes.</p>
<p>Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) results announced today by the Tertiary Education Commission show UC continues to produce high quality research and has distinguished itself in a wide range of subject areas.</p>
<p>UC has ranked in the top three in over half of the subject areas within which it submitted, and distinguished itself in four subject areas, ranking first in New Zealand in ecology, evolution and behaviour; marketing and tourism; political science, international relations and public policy; and public health.</p>
<p>UC Vice-Chancellor Professor Cheryl de la Rey is pleased with the result and acknowledges the resilience and adaptability of UC’s people to continue to produce high-quality research in uniquely challenging circumstances.</p>
<p>“During a difficult period when the focus was on teaching, regaining student numbers and rebuilding the university environment, we have continued to improve our overall research performance,” she says.</p>
<p>“This year we announced a 7% increase in students for 2019 and today’s result further solidifies the positive position UC is in. Looking to the future, this excellent PBRF result is another promising step in establishing a new strategic plan to carry UC forward to our milestone 150th anniversary in 2023 and beyond,” Professor De la Rey says.</p>
