<p><strong>Thursday, 4 April 2019, 10:23 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>4 April 2019</p>
<p>The effects of the Canterbury earthquakes on student numbers at Lincoln University may finally be over.</p>
<p>The total number of EFTS (Equivalent Full-time Students) enrolling for semester one this year is the highest since the province was hit by the series of quakes which began in September 2010.</p>
<p>In 2010 semester one EFTS stood at 1067 - in 2019 they are at 1061.</p>
<p>Lincoln University Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Bruce McKenzie said the University had worked hard to regain the pre-quake numbers.</p>
<p>“I think the figures show that Lincoln University is seen as an institution which provides a world-class education, and the province provides opportunities for a great future. It is a vote of confidence in us, and in Canterbury.”</p>
<p>He said one of the focuses in 2019 was to continue the drive to grow the number of Māori and Pasifika students at Lincoln.</p>
<p>Six new scholarships started this year to support and encourage Māori and Pasifika students to achieve their aspirations for their whenua, whānau, hapū and iwi.</p>
<p>The scholarships are a key component of Lincoln University’s Whenua Strategy (for Māori) and Motu Strategy (for Pasifika), and are given to students who demonstrate excellence in a range of subjects, including those focused on Te Ao Māori, agriculture, and science.</p>
<p>A mahika kai course was also initiated this year- often associated with food cultivation, mahika kai also encompasses engagement with, and maintenance of our environment. Lincoln will develop further undergraduate and postgraduate level courses incorporating mahika kai as the central focus of mātauraka Māori on campus.</p>
<p>In June, Lincoln University is also hosting the regional Ngā Manu Kōrero (Māori oratory) competitions for the first time, and a mahika kai conference will be held in December this year.</p>
