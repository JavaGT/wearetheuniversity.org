<p>Welfare numbers up as anti-growth policies bite</p>
<p>“Thousands more New Zealanders are now dependent on handouts as Labour’s anti-growth policies start to bite, according ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>An additional 13,063 people were on a main benefit in March as compared with 12 months earlier. That’s an increase of almost five per cent to 286,450 in just a year.</p>
<p>The number of New Zealanders receiving Jobseeker Support increased by 10.9 per cent to 131,720 over the same period.</p>
<p>“It’s a real tragedy that almost one in ten working-age New Zealanders is on a main benefit.</p>
<p>“Large increases in the minimum wage, the prospect of industry-wide centralised bargaining, and 17 months of uncertainty over a capital gains tax have taken their toll on the New Zealand economy.</p>
<p>“The Green Party’s review of the welfare system could see the Government endorse higher benefit levels and fewer sanctions, meaning beneficiaries have even less incentive to move into work.</p>
<p>“It’s unacceptable that so many New Zealanders are on a benefit. If people can work, they should.</p>
<p>“We should alleviate genuine hardship, but avoid dependency. Labour’s anti-growth policies are creating a new generation of people dependent on handouts and not living productive, independent lives.</p>
<p>“ACT’s pro-growth policies, if implemented, would deliver higher productivity, income and job growth. Low, flat taxes achieved by reducing wasteful spending; tighter welfare requirements so people are encouraged into work; less red tape and smarter infrastructure funding to ensure more houses are built and workers aren’t stuck in congestion; and giving parents and students educational choice that extends beyond their local state school.”</p>
