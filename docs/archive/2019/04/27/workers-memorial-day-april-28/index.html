<p><strong>Workers Memorial Day - April 28</strong>  </p>
<p>All around the globe events will be occurring to mark Workers Memorial Day to remember those who were killed at work.</p>
<p>&quot;In the last year 55 working Kiwis went to work and never came home. Every single person who heads out the door to begin their working day should have full confidence that they’ll return home again at the end of their work day,&quot; said CTU President Richard Wagstaff.</p>
<p>&quot;Of particular concern are construction, manufacturing, and agriculture (farming). These industries are killing more Kiwis than any other. We challenge employers to do more to keep those they employ safe at work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;WorkSafe estimates that 800 - 1000 people each year die from &quot;non-acute&quot; work related illnesses more than double the number people killed on our roads. People are dying from exposures to harmful products and chemicals which cause cancers and other serious illnesses. Of particular note action is still very much needed on the issue of asbestos.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;More than 3,000 people were seriously hurt at work in the last year. These are injuries which in many cases could have resulted in death. This number should be of real concern and a very clear indication that more, much more, needs to be done to make work safer,&quot; Wagstaff said.</p>
