<p>Police unprepared for flood of weapons</p>
<p>The robbery of eleven guns from a Palmerston North police station raises questions about whether authorities are prepared for the flood of prohibited weapons they will soon receive, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“This deeply concerning incident comes at a critical time.</p>
<p>“If Police can’t keep eleven guns safe and secure, how are they going to manage the hundreds of thousands of weapons that will soon begin flooding in?</p>
<p>“It was clear that, as the the Government’s gun reforms were moving through the Parliament, the Police Minister didn’t have a clear idea of how these weapons were to be handled and stored by Police.</p>
<p>“You have to feel for policemen and women who have been working around the clock to keep New Zealanders safe. The Government has placed them in an incredibly difficult position.</p>
<p>“Stuart Nash must demand answers from the Police Commissioner on how this robbery happened and how a similar act will be prevented from happening again.</p>
<p>“The Minister must assure New Zealanders that every possible step is being taken to ensure that weapons handed in to Police will be safe and secure and unable to re-enter circulation.”</p>
