<p><strong>Tuesday, 2 April 2019, 9:14 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions">New Zealand Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p>The CTU welcomes the updated Living Wage rate of $21.15 per hour.</p>
<p>The independently assessed rate is defined as being: ‘the income necessary to provide workers and their families with the basic necessities of life. A living wage will enable workers to live with dignity and to participate as active citizens in society.’</p>
<p>&quot;We celebrate those working in the Living Wage Movement who ensure the vision of a living wage is a reality for thousands of working Kiwis. We also acknowledge those employers who have decided to pay those they employ a wage they can actually live on. These employers know that paying a living wage is the fair thing to do,&quot; CTU Vice President Rachel Mackintosh said.</p>
<p>&quot;Since 2013 the annual Living Wage Rate has been reassessed each year. It is impossible to ignore the fact that today the minimum wage has increased to $17.70. So the difference between the living wage and the minimum wage is now $3.45.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We encourage all employers to do the right thing and ensure that they pay their employees a wage they can live and flourish on,&quot; Mackintosh said</p>
