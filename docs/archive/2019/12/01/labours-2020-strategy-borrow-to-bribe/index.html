<p><strong>Sunday, 1 December 2019, 10:04 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“Labour’s 2020 strategy has come into focus with a promise to borrow billions of dollars to win an election”, according to ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“Borrowing is not bad in and of itself, but new debt must go towards high-quality, long-term infrastructure.</p>
<p>“What are the shovel-ready projects that will be funded? Has the Treasury done cost-benefit analyses to ensure New Zealand will be better off as a result of their completion?</p>
<p>“It’s all well and good for Grant Robertson to point to historically low interest rates as a reason to borrow, but the quality of spending also matters.</p>
<p>“This Government’s spending priorities have been highly political: Fees-Free for students from middle-class families, the Provincial Growth Fund for NZ First’s base, and environmental corporate welfare through the Green Investment Fund.</p>
<p>“These wasteful schemes should make New Zealanders wary of any additional borrowing. That’s why it should be accompanied by a plan to cut existing low-value spending.</p>
<p>“The Government must not load up future generations with debt and taxes for the sake of winning an election.</p>
<p>“Labour needs to show that it has high-quality projects ready to go before it borrows to bribe.”</p>
