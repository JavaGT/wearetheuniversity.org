<p>A third of the 21 New Zealand students and recent graduates embarking on internships to learn how Asia does business are from the University of Canterbury.</p>
<p>The Asia New Zealand Foundation Te Whītau Tūhono business internships offer opportunities at some of Asia’s top companies, and vary from tax, accounting and engineering to digital marketing, blockchain and space technology.</p>
<p>The internships, ranging from six weeks to three months long, give young people a chance to be immersed in an Asian business culture and industry sector, which builds valuable work skills for their futures.</p>
<p>The expenses-paid internships are highly sought after, with more than 550 applications for the 21 places. Some interns have already started work, and others will be leaving between now and February 2020.</p>
