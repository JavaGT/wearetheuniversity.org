<p><strong>Saturday, 28 December 2019, 10:30 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>For the first time in many years there will be no emergency rescue helicopter stationed in Whitianga on the Coromandel Peninsula this summer, Coromandel’s MP Scott Simpson says.</p>
<p>“This is a huge slap in the face for locals and the hundreds of thousands of visitors here over the summer peak.</p>
<p>“We’ve been completely let down by the Labour Government who promised there would be no reduction to rescue helicopter services for the Coromandel Peninsula, but here we are this summer without a much needed machine and crew based in Whitianga.</p>
<p>“Local people are feeling angry and vulnerable at what is their busiest time of year.</p>
<p>“Health Minister David Clark gave assurances last year services would not be reduced, but now the Coromandel Rescue Helicopter Trust’s community funded and purpose built hanger in Whitianga is empty.</p>
<p>“Lives are at risk. Instead of having a fully trained flight crew with paramedics and a rescue helicopter here over the summer peak, we’re being told machines from as far away as Tauranga, Hamilton or Auckland may be deployed if there is a need.</p>
<p>“That’s very cold comfort to car accident victims, heart attack patients or others on the Coromandel Peninsula who may need urgent and quick access to a rescue helicopter.</p>
<p>“The people of Coromandel have always given generously in fundraising efforts to support a locally based service over the summer. To have it ripped away by a heartless, uncaring Government is insulting and potentially life threatening.</p>
<p>“David Clark needs to take a break from his holiday and issue an instruction to have a helicopter re-located back to Whitianga this week.”  </p>
