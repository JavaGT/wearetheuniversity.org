<p>A day at the office can mean interviewing gang members or quizzing politicians for young journalist Katie Harris, who loves the excitement of her job.</p>
<p>Katie, who grew up in Hillsborough, Christchurch, has just won the DW Bain Prize as the top student in this year’s University of Canterbury (UC) Postgraduate Diploma of Journalism class.</p>
<p>Her undergraduate degree at UC was a Bachelor of Arts and she went to school at Middleton Grange.</p>
<p>Katie has already found work as a journalist for New Zealand Media and Entertainment (NZME) at Newstalk ZB in Wellington, and in January she will travel to Jakarta, Indonesia to work for six weeks after being awarded a media internship through the Asia New Zealand Foundation.</p>
<p>“I knew I wanted to be a journalist as soon as I started studying Media Communications at UC,” she says. “I don’t know what other job I could do because I think I would get bored. This job is always changing and it’s always exciting. It’s definitely a tough industry but it’s good.”</p>
<p>UC Media and Communication Senior Lecturer Tara Ross says Katie – who broke a story about the first all-female chapter of Waikato’s Mongrel Mob Kingdom while she was still a student - was outstanding from the beginning.</p>
<p>“She stood out early for her curiosity, drive and hunger for news. She was unafraid of tackling hard stories and, I don’t doubt, can go far in journalism.”</p>

<p>Katie is drawn to “hard news” and first made contacts with Mongrel Mob Kingdom members from Hamilton when they came to UC to give a lecture to Criminal Justice Programme students in September.</p>
<p>Katie says the Postgraduate Diploma of Journalism course helped prepare her for the current multi-media world of journalism. “It was very practical. It definitely requires a lot of passion because it’s really full-on, but I loved it.</p>
<p>“I was never really an academic person before but I feel like I’ve found my niche and it shows anyone can succeed at what they do if they find something they’re passionate about and they work hard.”</p>
<p>Her dream is to one day work as a foreign correspondent and, with that in mind, she has been learning Arabic in the hope that she might one day be based in the Middle East.</p>
<p>She spent a month in the Czech Republic in August 2018 studying a paper in foreign correspondence journalism.</p>
<p>The adventurous young woman is also a keen surfer and she edited a youth magazine launched earlier this year called <em>Yo, Vocal</em>.</p>
