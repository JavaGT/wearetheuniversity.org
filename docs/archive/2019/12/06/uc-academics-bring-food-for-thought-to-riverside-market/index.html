<p><strong>Friday, 6 December 2019, 12:46 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>Every weekday next week, learning lunches will be on the menu at Riverside Market as five University of Canterbury (UC) academics share their thoughts in bite-sized public talks.</p>
<p>‘Food for Thought’ is a five-day series of 15-minute talks in the city, bringing the university’s thought leaders to the public, so people can feed their minds while filling their tummies.</p>
<p>Each day at midday Monday to Friday, an expert speaker from one of UC’s five Colleges will cover current thinking on an interesting topic in a short speech, by the Avon/Ōtākaro River, outside the Riverside Market on Oxford Terrace (inside Riverside Market if weather is wet).</p>
<p>The series of engaging and thought-provoking mini-lectures will cover diverse topics, ranging from using brainwaves as lie-detectors, to exploring food as medicine, to life in space, with a different speaker each lunchtime.</p>
