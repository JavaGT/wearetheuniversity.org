NZ Association of Scientists Dismayed by University of Otago Plans
to Sack Marine Scientists
The University of Otago wants to sack three scientists from the nation’s leading marine science
academic department. The NZAS finds this potential loss of knowledge and capability alarming
at a time when marine science, and training the next generation of marine scientists, has never
been more critical.
Past President Associate Professor Craig Stevens said “we appreciate the need to be fiscally
conservative when faced with uncertainty. However, what IS certain is that issues like sea level
rise, marine heat waves, ocean acidification, river-borne pollution, aquaculture, renewable
energy, and floating microplastics are growing in importance. All of these issues have a focal
point in the ocean - and Aotearoa New Zealand is surrounded by ocean”.
The responsibility of a high quality University goes far beyond bums on seats. There is a
responsibility to support unique groups of researcher-teachers who have to be world class AND
also highly connected to the local scene and challenges. For example, a unique feature of the
Aotearoa New Zealand science sector is the connection to Māori. The marine environment is a
major interface between western science and Mātauranga Māori - a challenging research area
and one the Department excels in.
Stevens said “the review is sending a very negative message to marine science students - and is
stressful for them and the staff involved”. We have responded to the call for submissions on the
plans by the University1
.
The need to maintain boats and marine laboratories means science in the marine environment is
expensive. We recognise that balancing the books can be challenging for any large organisation.
However, in being a large University there can be ways to share costs that maintain and expand
critical capacity. Stevens said “we recommend that the University consider alternate ways to do
this in order to fulfil its mandate and support the future of the Nation”.
