<p><strong>Tuesday, 1 October 2019, 3:10 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato">University of Waikato</a></strong></p>
<p>New Chancellor of The University of Waikato <a href="https://gg.govt.nz/biographies/rt-hon-sir-anand-satyanand-gnzm-qso">Rt Hon Sir Anand Satyanand GNZM QSO</a> was officially welcomed to the University this week with a whakatau at the Tauranga CBD campus yesterday and a pōwhiri at the Hamilton campus today.</p>
<p>The welcome events acknowledge the beginning of the leadership and governance role that Sir Anand was appointed to in August. A great privilege for both Sir Anand and students, the ceremonial events also mean that Sir Anand is now able to confer degrees on graduands of the University.</p>
<p>Sir Anand says that being welcomed into the University community and onto the marae with cultural events is greatly significant for a University with the highest proportion of Māori students in the country.</p>
<p>“These welcoming ceremonies are an official marker of a new governance contribution. They have brought together people from around the University and I have enjoyed the opportunity to connect with my new colleagues in both Hamilton and Tauranga,” says Sir Anand.</p>
<p>Sir Anand, who has had experience of the law and governance in a number of settings, says that he brings to the role a background from a different part of the New Zealand community.<br>University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor, Professor Neil Quigley, says Sir Anand is joining the University at an exciting time.</p>

<p>“We are not the largest university in the country, but we have a strong sense of community, and a student body that more than any other reflects the vibrant multicultural society of New Zealand today,” says Professor Quigley.</p>
<p>“We are delighted that someone of such a significant national and international standing has agreed to play a key role in the future direction and governance of the University of Waikato.”</p>
<p>A former lawyer, judge and ombudsman, Sir Anand is well-known to most New Zealanders for serving as the 19th Governor-General of New Zealand from 2006 to 2011.</p>
<p>Sir Anand’s appointment follows in the footsteps of predecessors including Sir Paul Reeves and Bernard Fergusson who after leaving office as Governor-General both went on to contribute to the education sector as University Chancellors.</p>
<p>In addition to his role as Chancellor, Sir Anand will Chair the University of Waikato Council’s People and Culture Committee and Honours Committee.</p>
