<p><strong>Monday, 7 October 2019, 10:27 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>A petition has been launched today calling for all new mums to have access to three days of fully funded postnatal care, National MP for Taupō Louise Upston says.</p>
<p>“Currently, new mums are entitled to stay in a hospital or postnatal facility for up to 48 hours – but many feel pressure to go home as soon as possible, sometimes only two or three hours after giving birth.</p>
<p>“National is proposing that new mums should be entitled to three days of care after birth, and that that support should be available after each child.</p>
<p>“Becoming a mum is an exciting time, but can also be overwhelming and frightening.</p>
<p>“Giving all new mums the chance to stay for up to three days in a hospital or postnatal facility will mean that if they experience the baby blues, have difficulty breastfeeding, face a medical emergency or simply just need some extra support to help them build up confidence, that support will be available.</p>
<p>“This policy will cost an additional $16-20 million, and the funding will be ringfenced. Mothers who are comfortable going home earlier will be able to, but if there are mothers who need to stay a little longer, the money will stay in the pot so they can.</p>
<p>“The first thousand days are the most important in a child’s life. By supporting families, National will help to get all Kiwi kids off to a good start.</p>
