<p><strong>Greens to focus on supporting New Zealanders who rent</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party has committed to prioritising support for New Zealanders who rent at their Annual Conference in Dunedin today.</p>
<p>Co-leader Marama Davidson announced that the Green Party is ready to negotiate its rent-to-own policy as part of the Government’s Kiwibuild reset, reforms to the Residential Tenancies Act, and a mandatory Warrant of Fitness to enforce proper standards for rental homes.</p>
<p>“Everyone deserves a warm, safe and healthy home to live in, and the Government has a role to provide this”, said Green Party Co-leader Marama Davidson.</p>
<p>“When people are safely and securely housed they are happier, healthier, and better able to deal with the adversities of life.</p>
<p>“Being in secure housing allows you to put down roots, join a community and give back.</p>
<p>“New Zealand has been relying on a market approach to provide things a market cannot and never will provide. We care about social and environmental needs, and the market approach has totally failed to protect these values.</p>
<p>“The Kiwibuild reset is an opportunity to make changes that tackle the causes of the housing crises, and not just manage the problems. We are working to include our rent-to-own policy in the Kiwibuild reset.</p>
<p>“Our rent-to-own policy will offer a pathway to people locked out of home ownership by student debt, high rents, low wages, high housing costs, and high costs of raising a family. We’ll be offering a pathway to home ownership for people who rent and cannot afford to save for a deposit.</p>

<p>“We have a plan to shift New Zealand’s approach to private rentals as well. We’ll be reforming the Residential Tenancies Act this term, and we believe that no-cause terminations must end.</p>
<p>“It’s also vital that we introduce a Warrant of Fitness scheme for all rental properties as an enforcement mechanism for the Healthy Homes Standards. We wouldn’t allow people to lease a dodgy rental car, why do we allow dodgy rental homes? Poor quality, damp housing causes sickness. It needs to stop and a housing Warrant of Fitness will do just that.</p>
<p>“These will be the first genuine steps toward reversing the trend in substandard housing and wealth inequality that has ballooned over the past three decades. It is not merely a short term patch. It is a long term transformation.”</p>
