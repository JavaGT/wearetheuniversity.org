<p><strong>Friday, 16 August 2019, 9:22 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Kiwi businesses deserve a government focused on the basics rather than smoke and mirrors to hide the harm the coalition Government’s anti-growth policies are doing to the economy, National’s Economic Development spokesperson Todd McClay says.</p>
<p>“With slowing GDP growth and talk of deficits and recession the Government must take responsibility for the harm its policies are doing domestically.</p>
<p>“Kiwi business are crying out for better infrastructure, balanced employment laws, lower costs and less regulation. They need a government that can get the basics right on economic growth and development.</p>
<p>“For instance, businesses are desperate for skilled workers yet significant delays in visa processing is slowing business down.</p>
<p>“Tourism businesses are missing out on $150m this year because of falling visitor numbers from key markets whilst the government dreams up new tourism taxes.</p>
<p>“Export education is being put on hold as our universities and polytechnics miss out on $70m of fees this year because student visas aren’t being processed.</p>
<p>“This Government inherited a strong economy, big surpluses and National’s proven economic plan. They’re wasting the hard work of kiwi businesses who deserve better.</p>
<p>“This part time Government must get the basics right before businesses are forced to be part time too.”</p>
