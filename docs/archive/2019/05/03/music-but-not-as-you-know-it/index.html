<p><strong>Music, but not as you know it</strong></p>
<p>Octophonic compositions? They are eight-channel electronic music works that are best performed in 8.1 channel surround sound for a truly immersive experience, explains University of Canterbury School of Music faculty member Reuben de Lautour.</p>
<p>Electroacoustic music researcher de Lautour will present several landmark octophonic compositions on 6 May.</p>
<p>Electroacoustic music requires listeners to broaden their definition of how music is made and how it sounds. “Most of the music in the concert is created by recording and processing “real world” sounds - that is sounds from daily (or not so daily) life that are captured, manipulated, and montaged together. In the concert we will hear everything from the sounds of the New Jersey Turnpike to environmental sounds from the island of Gotland in Sweden to sounds that are completely abstract.”</p>
<p>Make no mistake, in the electroacoustic world, these compositions were ground-breaking and the programme offers an excellent introduction to a range of styles.</p>
<p>“These are four composers who are acknowledged masters in the field of electroacoustic music. The compositions that will be played cover a wide range of styles, and have been played extensively in international festivals. Many of them have won awards in prestigious international competitions. All were composed this century, with the earliest work being Paul Lansky’s from the year 2000. The most recent work on the program, Topophilia by Nikos Stavropoulos, won the inaugural Iannis Xenakis International Electronic Music Competition in 2016. The composers are from the UK, Canada, Greece, and the United States.”</p>
<p>UC’s School of Music offers an impressive range of concerts during the year – see the calendar here.</p>
