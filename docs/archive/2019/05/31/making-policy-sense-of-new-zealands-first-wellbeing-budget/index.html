<p>Making policy sense of New Zealand’s First Wellbeing Budget</p>
<p>The Policy Fix Podcast - Bite-sized sessions from New Zealand’s best thinkers</p>
<p>Plans outlined in the 2019 Wellbeing budget can only be implemented with the right policy framework. But what is policy all about and why is it so important?</p>
<p>Brought to you by The Policy Observatory at AUT, The Policy Fix is a series of to-the-point interviews with some of Aotearoa’s best thinkers on the issues we face as a country and how we can solve them. The Policy Fix’s first series of four podcasts is on Inequality in Aotearoa.</p>
<p>Inequality – What NZers think - Peter Skilling, Senior Lecturer in Management, AUT</p>
<p>- Marsden-funded research into what New Zealanders think about inequality and the prospects for reducing it.</p>
<p>Economic inequality - Max Rashbrooke, Senior Associate, Institute for Governance and Policy Studies, VUW</p>
<p>- The state of economic inequality in Aotearoa today and a concise run through of his many policy recommendations for fixing the problem.</p>
<p>The injustice of NZ justice - Tracey McIntosh, Professor of Indigenous Studies, University of Auckland</p>

<p>- Inequality in the criminal justice system, the social inequalities that lead to it, and the sweeping changes we need to make as a country.</p>
<p>Homelessness - Shiloh Groot, Senior Lecturer in Social Psychology, University of Auckland</p>
<p>- Homelessness in Aotearoa, the attitudinal problems towards homelessness New Zealanders need to fix, and the wide policy approach necessary to really help.</p>
<p>Our next series is on environmental policy, and our first two episodes are available now:</p>
<p>Solving our freshwater crisis - Mike Joy, Senior Researcher, Institute for Governance and Policy Studies, VUW</p>
<p>- The nature of our freshwater crisis, its historical and political causes, and the policy changes that are needed to improve the situation</p>
<p>Green hydrogen - Kathy Errington, Executive Director, Helen Clark Foundation</p>
<p>- The opportunities of green hydrogen as an export industry and as a tool to eliminate fossil fuel use.</p>
<p>Upcoming podcasts from The Policy Fix will include interviews on the Living Standards Framework and wellbeing economics; Māori rights in natural resources; the future of local government, and more.</p>
