<p>Lincoln University has again come out on top in one of the leading national research quality measures.</p>
<p>The Tertiary Education Commission’s newly released Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) results put Lincoln first in the measure of average quality scores of active researchers per postgraduate and final year undergraduate student.</p>
<p>“It means at Lincoln you have the highest probability of being taught or supervised by a high-ranking researcher,” Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Bruce McKenzie said.</p>
<p>Lincoln also led that measure during the last PBRF assessment in 2012</p>
<p>“The PBRF rankings are a great result for Lincoln University. Our overall quality evaluation score increased by 30 percent, our ‘A’ scores by 23 percent and our ‘B’ scores went up 40 percent.</p>
<p>“This is due to researchers publishing in higher quality publications and improved research impact.”</p>
<p>The results also highlighted Lincoln strengths in land-based disciplines.</p>
<p>“The University’s focus on the land-based sectors is clearly evident in the data reported. We have demonstrable continued strength in the areas of agriculture and primary production, biological sciences and environmental management, and natural sciences; well supported by social sciences and management and marketing. Food and health is also a steadily growing sector for Lincoln University,” he said.</p>
<p>• <em>The Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) is a performance-based funding system to encourage and reward excellent research in New Zealand’s degree-granting organisations. It does not fund research directly but supports research, including post-graduate level teaching support.</em></p>
