<p><strong>Thursday, 2 May 2019, 5:31 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Universities_New_Zealand_-_Te_Pokai_Tara">Universities New Zealand - Te Pokai Tara</a></strong></p>
<p>Universities New Zealand welcomes the today’s announcement of increased funding for teacher training over the next four years.</p>
<p>“Universities prepare 80% of the primary and secondary teachers in New Zealand,” says UNZ Chief Executive Chris Whelan. “The funding package is designed to train or support an extra 3280 teachers over the next four years, with a range of measures including covering fees and living costs for trainees studying in hard-to-staff subject areas, recruiting graduates and professionals into low-decile secondary schools to teach while completing postgraduate training, and iwi-based scholarships.</p>
<p>“The additional funding will cover the extra costs involved in meeting new Teaching Council requirements, which is a welcome acknowledgement of the complexity of both the teaching profession and the preparation of new teachers. Providing direct financial support to future teachers via TeachNZ and iwi-based scholarships, and the voluntary bonding scheme will help lower the barrier to access and will the goal of recruiting and developing a more diverse teaching profession.”</p>
<p>“We look forward to continuing to strengthen our partnerships with schools, the NZ Teaching Council and the Ministry of Education to ensure high-quality teachers are placed in every classroom and school.”</p>
