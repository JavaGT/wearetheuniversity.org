<p><strong>Tuesday, 14 May 2019, 9:12 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Helen Clark’s proposal for more robust hate speech laws is a solution looking for a problem, according to ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“On Q+A this evening, Clark admitted that protecting religious groups from hate speech wouldn’t have prevented the Christchurch terrorist attack.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=FfLOwoe-Opm-2fuoPPL-DV3Fy86uhrzM0P0BkIP83YzV6e4GhlJmUg7lIrMbb0W-GqpqxHEtjJjOEo966W8d1VUPwQt5MKnVMI-TpaNb71OjxI-AP1_RhdWTAiXJTrCM&e=752ed10e9ed7db3a7867d6b86ebadc6c&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=clark_admits_new_speech&n=2">Her own Foundation’s report</a>, released tonight, says ‘…it is difficult to establish a causal link between online hate speech and violence.’</p>
<p>“Why, then, do we need additional laws that would further undermine New Zealanders’ right to freedom of expression?</p>
<p>“New Zealand already has tools available to deal with speech that incites violence or offences which are targeted at particular groups.</p>
<p>“Adding new groups to our hate speech laws will create division and further criminalise speech.</p>
<p>“Just in the past few weeks we’ve seen Hobson’s Pledge the subject of a complaint to the Human Rights Commission, a One Law for All pamphlet denounced by the Justice Minister, and an anti-Islam pamphlet investigated by Police. This shows how easily hate speech laws could become weaponised.</p>
<p>“Besides, it isn’t obvious that religion should be treated in the same way as race. Race is an immutable characteristic, whereas religion is a set of ideas. We shouldn’t restrict debate about, and criticism of, religion.</p>

<p>“The idea that a government agency should make arbitrary judgements of what is and isn’t a reasonable opinion for people to express is counter to the Bill of Rights Act, which says: ‘Everyone has the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and opinions of any kind in any form.’</p>
<p>“If the Government broadens our hate speech laws, we will see more New Zealanders hauled before authorities for expressing their political views. That would be deeply divisive.”</p>
