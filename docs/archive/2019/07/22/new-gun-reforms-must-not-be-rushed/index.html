<p><strong>Monday, 22 July 2019, 3:24 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“The Government must avoid the mistakes it made earlier in the year by not rushing the next phase of firearms reform,” ACT Leader David Seymour says.</p>
<p>“Speculation is growing that the Prime Minister will this afternoon announce a second tranche of gun law reform.</p>
<p>“Jacinda Ardern and Stuart Nash must ensure that any legislation goes through a robust and democratic process.</p>
<p>“In April, the Government treated law-abiding gun owners with contempt by forcing legislation through Parliament in just nine days without meaningful parliamentary scrutiny or public consultation.</p>
<p>“ACT was the only party to vote against the legislation. The events of the past several weeks vindicate that decision.</p>
<p>“Police errors show they are ill-equipped to carry out the ‘buyback’ scheme and few of the hundreds of thousands of now-banned guns have been handed in.</p>
<p>“The unfortunately reality is that, because of the Government’s actions, thousands of guns may now go underground, without regulatory oversight, making New Zealand less safe.</p>
<p>“If indeed further firearms reforms are announced today, the Government must show a willingness to properly consult with the gun community, the public, and other political parties on the legislation.</p>
<p>“ACT believes we should consider changes to firearm licencing and the ‘fit and proper person’ test.</p>
<p>“If the Government is willing to observe a full and democratic process, rather than rushing its legislation, ACT will consider its proposals carefully and work constructively for better public policy.”</p>
