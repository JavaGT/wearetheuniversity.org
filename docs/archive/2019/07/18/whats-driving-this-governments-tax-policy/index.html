<p><strong>What’s driving this Government’s tax policy?</strong></p>
<p>After saying she wouldn’t give tax cuts to people who didn’t need them, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s Government has done a 180-degree turn on her pledge with its latest tax on cars, National’s Finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>“The Government’s tax policy is making less and less sense by the day.</p>
<p>“The first thing it did was cancel National’s tax cuts because the Prime Minister said they would benefit well-off New Zealanders too much.</p>
<p>“So why is her Government now taxing Kiwis who can’t afford to buy a $65,000 BMW i3 or a $65,000 Volkswagen e-Golf, just so wealthier people can drive them around town?</p>
<p>“It’s not the first head-scratcher we’ve seen from this Government on tax. It also gave wealthier New Zealanders a helping hand by paying their university fees.</p>
<p>“At the same time, it has hit struggling New Zealanders with three fuel tax increases on top of a regional fuel tax in Auckland, a tax on most things they buy from overseas websites (Amazon Tax), a tax on their cellphones (GST on mobile roaming) and it has increased Worksafe levies.</p>
<p>“Kiwi households were already, on average, $1750 a year worse off because of taxes being piled on by the Labour-led Government. Now its car tax will make many of New Zealand’s most popular, and safest, cars up to $3000 more expensive.</p>
<p>“Labour can’t be trusted when it comes to tax. National will index tax thresholds to the cost of living and won’t introduce any new taxes in our first term.</p>
<p>“National believes New Zealanders should keep more of what they earn.”</p>
