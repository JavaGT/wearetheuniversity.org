<p><strong>Thursday, 18 July 2019, 8:27 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Today I placed a Members Bill in the ballot that would require the Department of Corrections to notify schools of sex offenders placed in their local communities, Waimakariri MP Matt Doocey says.</p>
<p>“Recently, after two sex offenders were housed in Waimakariri, I was appalled to learn that there is no requirement for the Department of Corrections to inform local schools.</p>
<p>“My Members Bill will ensure all schools within five kilometres, or the nearest school if there are none within the five kilometre area, will be notified of the placement of a sex offender.</p>
<p>“The Bill will require the Department of Corrections to notify local schools 48 hours before the release of a sex offender into a community, or within 72 hours of housing the sex offender in a new residential address.</p>
<p>“I accept that some sex offenders will need to be managed in the community, but as a parent it’s outrageous that local schools are not informed of a sex offender’s placement in their community.</p>
<p>“I have also created a petition calling on the Department of Corrections to notify schools of sex offenders placed in their local communities.</p>
<p>“By ensuring schools are aware of these situations, it gives them the ability to make informed decisions about what’s best for their students. I believe parents expect this.”</p>
