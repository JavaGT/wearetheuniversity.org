<p>Paul Goldsmith - Finance</p>
<p>4 July 2019  </p>
<p>New Zealanders will today be looking across the ditch where low and middle-income Australians are about to receive just over a thousand dollars a year in tax relief, National’s Finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>“Australia’s Government made relief for hardworking taxpayers its first priority after the election. The legislation will pass through the Senate today. Our Government’s first priority was cancelling our tax relief package.</p>
<p>“We have strong terms of trade and high international commodity prices. The Government can’t keep blaming New Zealand’s declining growth on ‘international headwinds’.</p>
<p>“The only exports this Government is directly increasing through its policies are New Zealanders to Australia. New Zealanders are over-taxed and underwhelmed by this Government.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister and her Finance Minister frequently describe Australia as experiencing lower growth than us, yet it can deliver tax relief to hardworking taxpayers and we can’t.</p>
<p>“The previous National Government legislated for tax relief of $1060 for the average worker but this Government cancelled it.</p>
<p>“A National Government would link income tax brackets to inflation as a priority, ensuring income taxes are adjusted every three years in line with the cost of living and allowing New Zealanders to keep more of what they earn.”</p>
