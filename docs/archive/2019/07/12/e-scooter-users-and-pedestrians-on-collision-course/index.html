<p>Lincoln University post-doctoral researcher, Dr Helen Fitt, says tensions between e-scooter users and pedestrians are problematic and “not likely to go away”.</p>
<p>Dr Fitt and colleague Dr Angela Curl of the University of Otago recently conducted a survey* on the use of e-scooters in New Zealand. Initial findings show 90% of scooter users had ridden on the footpath, but only half of users and around a quarter of non-users think that is the right place to ride them.</p>
<p>“There is a lot of contention about scooter use on footpaths from other footpath users including older people and people with disabilities.”</p>
<p>“Some scooter users are aware they are not wanted on footpaths,” Dr Fitt said.</p>
<p>“It makes them uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>She said that riders were often not confident in traffic and felt unable to signal by taking their hands off the handlebars; this means the scooters are generally not suitable for the road.</p>
<p>“Scooters are very popular for good reasons, but our survey suggests they currently don’t fit well within existing infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Dr Fitt said the scooters are part of the electric vehicle movement, which is blurring the lines between transport modes.</p>
<p>“It is becoming less clear what belongs where and which rules apply,” she said.</p>
<p>“We need to start some serious conversations about how to integrate new modes of transport into urban environments.”</p>
<p>“We might need to consider infrastructural zones based on speed not vehicle type, with slow, medium, and fast zones instead of pedestrian, cycle, and vehicle zones.”</p>

<p>Dr Fitt said scooters are part of “electric micro-mobility and wider changes in transport”.</p>
<p>“If scooters do not stay around, something equivalent will take their place. This means the conversation about what belongs where will still be relevant even if scooters are removed.”</p>
