<p><strong>Thursday, 25 July 2019, 4:38 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>It is disgraceful that safety upgrades to the Wellington region’s most dangerous road have been delayed indefinitely thanks to a lack of funding by the Government, Nation-al’s Transport spokesperson Chris Bishop says.</p>
<p>“The Government confirmed in Parliament today that upgrades to State Highway 58, from Pauatahanui to Upper Hutt, will not be in place before the Transmission Gully mo-torway opens.</p>
<p>“In the past week alone there have been four accidents on SH58, which is statistically the Wellington region’s most dangerous road.</p>
<p>“Residents along SH58 are crying out for urgent action and are angry that construction of two roundabouts have been delayed, despite funding having previously been ap-proved.</p>
<p>“The upgrades were meant to be in place by the time Transmission Gully opens next year, which will add thousands of cars to the route.</p>
<p>“The Automobile Association estimates that deaths and serious injuries on SH58 could nearly double once Transmission Gully opens, but the Government still won’t act.</p>
<p>“These delays fly in the face of its alleged commitment to saving lives. The Government is quick to trumpet road safety as a priority and claim funding has increased, yet there is no money for Wellington’s most dangerous road.</p>
<p>“The delayed safety upgrades comes on the back of news that the new Melling Inter-change in Lower Hutt has been delayed until 2028 or later, while the Petone to Grena-da link road has been effectively cancelled and the Cross Valley Link is on the never-never.</p>
<p>“The Government is failing Wellington and the Hutt Valley.”</p>
