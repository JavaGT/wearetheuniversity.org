<p>Research by the Auckland University of Technology and Electric Kiwi suggests that constructs of being Kiwi are changing- towards wine, oysters, the silver fern and Māori culture.</p>
<p>Senior Lecturer Dr Lindsay Neill has conducted two surveys and found that traditionalkiwiana, such as the Buzzy Bee andjandals,do for many peoplestill represent New Zealand identity.</p>
<p>However, Māori culture and the country’s flora and fauna are emerging to bestow Kiwis with a unique place in the world, he says.</p>
<p>“While many New Zealanders find comfort in the nostalgic view promoted within the ‘good old days’, a new face reflecting Kiwi identity and materiality is emerging,” Neill says.</p>
<p>“Kiwis still consider themselves unique and are not afraid to share the characteristics hallmarking that uniqueness.InfactmanyKiwi’sare becoming almost boastful about how Maori culture forefronts Kiwi identity, particularly overseas.&quot;</p>
<p>Neill conducted two surveys in 2018, with the first looking at how important or relevant existing items ofkiwianawere to New Zealanders – thejandal, the Buzzy Bee, Four Square, hokey pokey ice cream, theSwanndri, Edmonds’ Baking Powder, and Wattie’s peas.</p>
<p>The survey respondents overwhelmingly endorsed these items as reflecting Kiwi culture (although not so much with Wattie’s peas).</p>
<p>The reason this traditional view ofkiwianapersists is likely due to the large numbers of baby boomers, Neill says.</p>
<p>These items permeated their childhood during the era of New Zealand’s Golden Weather (from the mid 1940s to the early 1970s) when high export earning made the nation prosperous.</p>

<p>The second survey asked how strongly people thought and felt about new items ofkiwiana:theBluff oyster, the Auckland Sky Tower, the silver fern, the flat white, Kiwi wines and Māori culture.</p>
<p>These items were selected from previous research in which Neill identified them as new indicators of Kiwi identity.</p>
<p>Participants were asked to rate the ‘value of importance’ that these items had for them, as well as give comments on them.</p>
<p>“Survey Two revealed that Māori culture and materiality were perceived by participants as being of vital importance to Kiwi identity and materiality,” Neill says.</p>
<p>“This is a huge change from the good-old days and the Golden Weather thinking.</p>
<p>“Wine and oysters, and the silver fern, were also strongly associated with being Kiwi.Those results are of little surprise to wine aficionados and Southlanders.”</p>
<p>Just over 300 people filled out the first survey, and 985 people filled out the second.</p>
<p>Lindsay Neill is a Senior Lecturer in International Hospitality Management at the Auckland University of Technology.</p>
<p>His research interests include the sociology of food, New Zealand&#39;s vernacular material culture and identities within Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
