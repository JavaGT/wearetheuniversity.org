<p><strong>Tuesday, 3 September 2019, 5:34 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Government needs to show more support for pre-fab home manufacturers to help undo KiwiBuild’s damage, National’s Building and Construction spokesperson Andrew Bayly says.</p>
<p>“The news that Canterbury-based Welhaus Limited and its sister company Welstruct have been placed into liquidation does not auger well for the pre-engineered, panelised homes market in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Also known as offsite manufacture (OSM) or modular construction, this method of house building has been tipped as a solution to deliver on the Government’s KiwiBuild promises.</p>
<p>“Although there have been soothing words of encouragement from both the Minister of Housing and Minister of Building &amp; Construction, little tangible support has eventuated.</p>
<p>“What is required – and quickly – is the development of a National Standard to get around councils applying different ways of consenting this form of modern modular manufacture.</p>
<p>“If the Government is serious about supporting a New Zealand-based home modular industry then it should also be placing some orders.</p>
<p>“Many companies have spent hundreds of hours applying to become an accredited OSM contractor to KiwiBuild and, as yet, it does not appear anyone has been awarded a contract.</p>
<p>“Surely with all the delays plaguing KiwiBuild, the Government would be showing some urgency.</p>
<p>“Offsite manufacturing is an increasingly viable option, but these types of factories require committed manufacturing volumes to help cover the expensive capital cost of establishing these highly-mechanised manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>“It’s time for the Government to stop procrastinating and get on with it.”</p>
