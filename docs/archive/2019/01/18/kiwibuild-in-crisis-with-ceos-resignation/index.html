<p><strong>Friday, 18 January 2019, 2:16 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>The Government’s flagship KiwiBuild programme is in crisis with head Stephen Barclay today resigning, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“Phil Twyford can’t even manage his own department – how can we expect him to plan and build 100,000 new houses?</p>
<p>“This is the danger of putting the Government in charge of a massive house building programme.</p>
<p>“Twyford must urgently move to cut planning red tape so that the private sector can take over and build the houses New Zealanders need.</p>
<p>“We have a housing crisis because regulation has made land artificially scarce and houses expensive.</p>
<p>“The latest manifestations are in Auckland and Wellington where students are paying to share beds and sleep in living rooms.</p>
<p>“KiwiBuild will not add to the housing supply and will not solve the housing crisis.</p>
<p>“The Government is simply buying existing private sector homes, placing a KiwiBuild logo on them, and adding a set of bureaucratic rules around who can buy them.</p>
<p>“Phil Twyford should be getting to the source of the housing crisis by tackling red tape, something he campaigned on in opposition.</p>
<p>“The Government was elected to solve the housing crisis. Nine months in, it is desperately failing.”</p>
