<p>Lincoln only New Zealand university in sustainability rankings</p>
<p>For the second consecutive year Lincoln is the only New Zealand university ranked in the UI Green Metric World University Rankings, which measure sustainability.</p>
<p>The University’s highest score in the recently released 2018 rankings came in the education category, putting it at 111 globally, while sitting at 218 overall.</p>
<p>Lincoln’s ratio of sustainability courses amongst its total courses, and its sustainability related publications and events, earned top scores.</p>
<p>Lincoln University Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor Bruce McKenzie, said the ranking reflected the importance Lincoln placed on sustainability throughout its courses, as well as on campus.</p>
<p>“We have specific courses which focus completely on the issue, such as Sustainable Futures, and it features in environmental studies, but it is also part of tourism and many other areas.</p>
<p>“We have also initiated a University Centre of Research Excellence called “Sustainable Tourism for Regions, Communities and Landscapes”, and sustainability will be integral in another new University Centre of Research Excellence, “Designing Future Productive Landscapes”, so it is also a focus of our research.</p>
<p>“We want to equip our students with the skills and knowledge to ensure a bright and prosperous future, and to make sure they are capable of dealing with any issues they could be confronted with,” he said.</p>
<p>Lincoln’s 2017 Environmental Sustainability Policy outlines the University’s commitment to act as an international leader (and a leading organisation in New Zealand) in promoting and achieving ecologically, socially and economically sustainable development.</p>

<p>It is incorporated into all aspects of the University’s activities, including research and teaching and facilities management and operational practices, including all University properties and farms.</p>
<p>The University also has a Sustainability Action Group for our Environment (SAGE), responsible for ensuring that the “University treads lightly on the earth”. It looks at areas such as energy conservation, water management and resource recovery on campus.</p>
