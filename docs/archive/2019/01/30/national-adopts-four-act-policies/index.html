<p><strong>Wednesday, 30 January 2019, 3:38 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>David Seymour has today welcomed the National Party’s adoption of four ACT Party policies – a signal that the party provides much needed intellectual horsepower to the centre-right in New Zealand</p>
<p>“In his State of the Nation speech today, National Party Leader Simon Bridges committed to: reinstating charter schools, reforming the Resource Management Act, no new taxes, and ending bracket creep.</p>
<p>“I worked for six years as an advisor and Under-Secretary for Education to establish charter schools. They helped thousands of disadvantaged children who had been failed by the state education system.</p>
<p>“The Resource Management Act is the biggest obstacle to building houses and bringing housing costs down. ACT offered National multiple opportunities to meaningfully reform the RMA in the last term.</p>
<p>“No nation has taxed itself into prosperity. ACT has consistently pushed for New Zealanders to keep more of what they earn through flatter taxes and an end to bracket creep.</p>
<p>“ACT will continue to provide ideas for a better tomorrow.”</p>
