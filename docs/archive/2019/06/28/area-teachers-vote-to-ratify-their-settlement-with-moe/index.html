<p>Area school teachers vote to ratify their settlement with the Ministry of Education</p>
<p><strong><em>28 June 2019</em></strong></p>
<p>Teachers in area schools and wharekura have voted to ratify a settlement to their collective agreement negotiations.</p>
<p>The settlement comes after area school and wharekura teachers joined with their primary and secondary colleagues in the largest education strike in New Zealand&#39;s history on 29 May, and follows primary teachers voting to ratify their settlement earlier this week.</p>
<p>Area school teachers, who are jointly represented by NZEI Te Riu Roa and PPTA, will move onto a new unified base pay scale from 1 July, which will see them have pay parity with their primary and secondary teaching colleagues.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa President Lynda Stuart said the outcome was important for area school teachers and wharekura kaiako.</p>
<p>&quot;As with our primary teachers, I&#39;m really pleased our passionate and dedicated area school teachers have secured pay parity and a significant pay increase in this deal - that&#39;s really important if we&#39;re to attract and retain people. We&#39;ll be working hard to address outstanding workload and wellbeing issues through our accord with the Government.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Area school teachers were part of 29 May&#39;s historic strike action - I&#39;m really proud of them for joining in that powerful show of collective action and for getting a result from the Government,&quot; she said.</p>

<p><strong><em>What’s in the settlement for area school teachers?</em></strong></p>
