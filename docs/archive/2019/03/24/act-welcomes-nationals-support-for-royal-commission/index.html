<p>ACT welcomes National’s support for Royal Commission</p>
<p>ACT Leader David Seymour has welcomed the National Party’s support for a Royal Commission of Inquiry into our intelligence services.</p>
<p>On Tuesday in Parliament, <a href="https://www.act.org.nz/speech_christchurch_mosque_terrorist_attacks_tuesday_19_march_2019?e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=act_welcomes_national_s&n=2">Mr Seymour said</a> the issues arising from the terrorist attacks in Christchurch required nothing less than a Royal Commission, reporting to the Governor-General, at arm’s length from Government.</p>
<p>“The first and most important task of any government is to protect its citizens from violence,” says Mr Seymour.</p>
<p>“The worshippers killed in Christchurch should have been safe. This was their home.</p>
<p>“These terrorist attacks are a clear reflection that our intelligence services did not work to protect New Zealanders in the way they should have.</p>
<p>“The Government will be tempted to rush to put measures in place, but New Zealanders deserve a comprehensive account of how these attacks were allowed to take place and how similar violence can be prevented from ever happening in this country again.</p>
<p>“Royal Commissions of Inquiry were appointed in relation to the Pike River tragedy and the Canterbury earthquakes and the scale of this tragedy demands no lesser response.</p>
<p>A Royal Commission is the highest form of public inquiry reserved for the most serious matters of public importance. It has substantial investigative powers and is completely independent of the Executive.</p>

<p>“The Terms of Reference of a Royal Commission should consider why these individuals were not detected by authorities, whether the intelligence services are adequately resourced, and whether the New Zealand Intelligence and Security Act, passed just a couple of years ago, is fit for purpose.</p>
<p>“While the Prime Minister will be under significant pressure to act swiftly and decisively in relation to the Christchurch terrorist attacks, any response should be considered and grounded in evidence.”</p>
