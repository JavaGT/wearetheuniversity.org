<p>Paid union meetings to be replaced by online ballots following terrorist attacks<br>21 March 2019</p>
<p>Primary teachers and principals will now vote in online ballots about whether to accept the Ministry&#39;s latest collective agreement offers, following the cancellation of this week&#39;s paid union meetings.</p>
<p>The NZEI Te Riu Roa National Executive decided on Sunday to cancel the meetings as a mark of respect to the 50 people killed in the terrorist attack in Christchurch -- and so members could be in their schools this week to provide continuity and stability for their students.</p>
<p>After discussions with member leaders in Christchurch, the National Executive decided last night to run an electronic ballot from Monday 1 April to Friday 5 April. We think this is the least disruptive way for members to respond to the Ministry&#39;s current offers.</p>
<p>Next week&#39;s nationwide paid union meetings for Area School teachers have also been cancelled for the same reasons.</p>
<p>Area school teacher members will now hold joint site meetings after school with their PPTA colleagues to discuss and vote on endorsing their claim for upcoming collective agreement negotiations.</p>
