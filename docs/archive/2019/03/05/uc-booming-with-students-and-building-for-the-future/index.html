<p><strong>Ground broken for building new 500-bed residential hall</strong></p>
<p>“New residential accommodation will create an opportunity for more of our future students to experience student life living away from home,” Professor De la Rey says.</p>
<p>“This is the largest new accommodation build to date for the University of Canterbury. Located on Homestead Lane, it’s designed to be home to 508 students and is just a short walk from the main campus.”</p>
<p>The new accommodation will include:<br>• communal study and social spaces,<br>• games and music rooms,<br>• shared bathroom and en suite room options,<br>• catered and self-catered dining options.</p>
<p>The new residential hall is due to be ready to house students from 2021.</p>
