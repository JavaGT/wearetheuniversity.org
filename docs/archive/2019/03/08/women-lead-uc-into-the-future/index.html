<p><strong>Women lead UC into the future</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Celebrating women’s achievement - International Women’s Day 2019 (8 March)</em></strong></p>
<p>The University of Canterbury is understood to be the first and only New Zealand university to be led by two women. For the first time in its nearly 150-year history, UC is led by two women – lawyer and UC alumna Sue McCormack as its new Chancellor, and former Vice-Chancellor of South Africa’s largest research university Professor Cheryl de la Rey as UC’s new Vice-Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>UC leadership</strong></p>
<p>Among the five colleges that make up the University of Canterbury, four of the five Pro-Vice-Chancellors are women, including the heads of Business and Law (Professor Sonia Mazey); Education, Health and Human Development (Professor Letitia Fickel); Engineering (Professor Jan Evans-Freeman); and Science (Professor Wendy Lawson), with UC’s College of Arts led by a male Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Professor Jonathan Le Cocq).</p>

Thereafter she was appointed as Deputy Vice-Chancellor at the University of Cape Town. Prior to her current position, she was the CEO of the Council on Higher Education. She has 18 years’ experience as an executive in higher education in South Africa. She has a reputation for visionary, strategic thinking accompanied by strong management ability.</p>

She has served as vice-chairperson of the Council of the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU) and she was the founding co-chairperson of the Australia-Africa Universities Network (AAUN) and the South Africa-Japan Universities Forum. She was a member of the executive board of the International Council for Science (ICSU), the University Social Responsibility Network (USRN) and vice-chairperson of the Talloires Network, an international association of institutions committed to strengthening the civic roles and social responsibilities of higher education.</p>
