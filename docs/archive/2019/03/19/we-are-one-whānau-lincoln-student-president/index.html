<p><strong>Tuesday, 19 March 2019, 4:49 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>The Lincoln University community is reeling from last Friday’s devastating terror attacks in Christchurch and offering as much support and solace as possible to students, staff, alumni, partners and friends.</p>
<p>Sadly, the university is likely to have lost members of its whānau. Further details will be provided when all victims have been formally identified.</p>
<p>A memorial service was held yesterday on campus, with Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Bruce McKenzie expressing his shock and sorrow at the apparent passing of members of the Lincoln family.</p>
<p>“In my 39 years in New Zealand and my 37 years at Lincoln University, I never considered that one day I might be offering my Lincoln whānau words of comfort a few days after a senseless attack on my family,” he said.</p>
<p>“The Lincoln University community truly is a big family. We love each other, we always look after each other and we embrace our diversity and many cultures. When I first came to Lincoln, I was welcomed with open arms.</p>
<p>“This is absolutely not the New Zealand that I know and love.”</p>
<p>Professor McKenzie directly addressed Lincoln University’s Muslim community, asserting that they could count on the support and love of the entire Lincoln family.</p>
<p>“We stand right next to you,” he said. “We value you on our campus for your knowledge, experience, hard work, friendship, culture and religion. Your presence here makes our campus stronger.”</p>
<p>Lincoln University Students’ Association President Kristy Havill also spoke to the crowd, directing a message specifically to students.</p>

<p>“To us, you are not just students, but you are our family. We are all one whānau,” she said.</p>
<p>“He thought he could break us, divide us, and drive a wedge between us. But he was wrong. He doesn’t know who we are as Kiwis, as residents of Canterbury. Earthquakes couldn’t defeat us and this won’t either.</p>
<p>“On this day, remember those we have lost and stand together as students of Lincoln University. It’s not my Lincoln, it’s not your Lincoln, it’s our Lincoln.”</p>
<p>The university is providing support to all who may need it, with trained counsellors at the Student Health Centre, a dedicated team of Chaplains, drop-in sessions for students and Employee Assistance Programme services for staff.</p>
<p>Those who require help can also email a Lincoln-based support service and receive immediate guidance.</p>
<p>A 24-hour security patrol remains in operation on the Lincoln campus to ensure the safety of students and staff.</p>
<p>For those who would like to donate to the Lincoln University Muslim Association, please contact the Lincoln University Students’ Association President, Kristy Havill at <a href="mailto:president@lusa.org.nz">president@lusa.org.nz</a></p>
