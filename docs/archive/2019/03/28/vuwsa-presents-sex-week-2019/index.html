<p><strong>Thursday, 28 March 2019, 10:43 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association">Victoria University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>VUWSA’s inaugural sex education event has gone through puberty and VUWSA, in partnership with Victoria University of Wellington, is proudly launching Sex Week 2019, held from 1 – 5 April, with multiple days of fun, frank and factual yarns about sex, consent, and relationships.</p>
<p>This follows the 2018 event Sex in the Hub, where hundreds of students attended the day-long event, aimed at learning all the stuff things high school doesn’t teach you about having a safe, informed, healthy and enthusiastic sex life.</p>
<p>The idea sprang out of VUWSA’s ongoing Thursdays In Black campaign to reduce sexual harm in the student community.</p>
<p>While the age of consent in Aotearoa is 16, university is also one of the first spaces that young people can be spoken to as adults, about sex and all the complicated and diverse issues that arise when you start having it.</p>
<p>With support and funding from Victoria University of Wellington, the event is being expanded this year to include Te Aro and Pipitea Campuses so that the event is available for as many students as possible to get involved.</p>
<p>The events include working with upwards of 18 sex positive organisations and businesses to provide information on all things sex-related. Massey University Wellington Students’ Association (MAWSA) is also joining VUWSA at Sex Week, with student art exhibitions focusing on sexual harm reduction and positive sexual expression.</p>
<p><strong>VUWSA President Tamatha Paul, says:</strong></p>
<p>“It’s genuinely worrying, the lack of information some students are coming to university with. Particularly around consent and sexual harm, but there are even gaps with basic stuff about their own physical and sexual health as well.</p>

<p>“Events like these are about leveling the playing field. We can’t expect adults to be have safe, healthy and enjoyable sex if they don’t all have the information.”</p>
<p>“Also, as the students’ association, sometimes it’s a bit less awkward coming from us because we’re all peers. It’s not like having an awkward sex talk with your mum and dad, or your high school health teacher.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Pam Thorburn, Director of Student Academic Services at Victoria University of Wellington, says:</strong></p>
<p>“After the success of last year’s Sex in The Hub event, the University is proud to support VUWSA again to run Sex Week which will reach even more of our students on all of our campuses.</p>
<p>“Victoria University of Wellington takes its commitment to supporting a learning environment that is free from sexual violence seriously. Through initiatives like Sex Week we are able to have open and frank discussions with our students and staff on how they can contribute to this culture which is consistent with our university values.</p>
<p>“This event also encourages students to think about issues of consent and bystander intervention as well as developing an understanding of the value of engaging in positive and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>“Sex Week is being held at the same time the University is consulting with students and staff on a stand-alone Sexual Harassment Prevention Policy and associated Procedures. We encourage all students to provide the University with feedback on the draft documents, and to attend the upcoming forums.”</p>
