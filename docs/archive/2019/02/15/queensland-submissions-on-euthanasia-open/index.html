<p><strong>Friday, 15 February 2019, 9:18 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>For the first time Queensland Parliament is seeking public views on assisted dying after launching a landmark parliamentary inquiry into legalisation last September.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Parliament called on all Queenslanders and international experts to share their views on assisted dying now before submissions close on April 15.</p>
<p>The call for submissions comes as the Western Australia Government plans to introduce a Government Bill to legalise assisted dying following their own inquiry in 2018 which found assisted dying should be made available for people experiencing grievous and irremediable suffering from a progressive terminal, chronic or neurodegenerative conditions.</p>
<p>The inquiry also comes as the State of Victoria’s assisted dying laws come in to effect this year and the End of Life Choice Bill returns to parliament for its second reading later this year, after receiving over 37,000 public submissions.</p>
<p>Chair of the Health Committee overseeing the inquiry, Aaron Harper MP says, “Put simply we are looking at three of the biggest issues that will affect the lives of all Queenslanders - care when we age, care if we become terminally ill, and having a choice in how and when we die.&quot;</p>
<p>Queensland Premiere Annastacia Palaszczuk has also raised the possibility of taking the discussion Australia-wide by saying she would have the issue added to the Council of Australian Governments national agenda.</p>
<p>More information on the inquiry and submissions can be found on the Queensland Parliament website: <a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=aDRdpDfXeI8Gdrzycx2wwiHz01DaAZ05XMoY-SlQ8q5EeZIvLIKRiyrTmuKPJU8bSddrtNpWVyWvKAXX7diCDp9FJh25XmvjWlmhQ4QYCBARoanXhVnYolUi3LjvJ7bYSWwJ8UBkIYKFEqCA6a6j3Y9xT7FzCVBfgUFGpcR1W78&e=752ed10e9ed7db3a7867d6b86ebadc6c&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=queensland_submissions&n=2">https://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/work-of-committees/committees/HCDSDFVPC/inquiries/current-inquiries/AgedCareEOLPC</a></p>
