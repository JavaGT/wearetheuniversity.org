<p>Young people in Porirua will get the support they need with free mental health support</p>
<p>The first trial taking place in Porirua, will provide free mental health support for under 25s to ensure young people can thrive, Green Party Mental Health spokesperson Chlöe Swarbrick said today.</p>
<p>“This is our Confidence and Supply Agreement in action. This is the Greens in Government.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled the Labour Party and New Zealand First have been so receptive to ensure our young people are supported.</p>
<p>“My personal history with mental ill health is on the public record, alongside thousands of other New Zealander’s stories. These struggles, compounded by poverty, trauma and isolation should not be normalised growing pains in a country that has the resources to ensure wellbeing.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled that this pilot has been designed to put peer support front and centre and ensure high accessibility. Young people will be able to access free support through their school, a mental health hotline, their doctor, and many more touchpoints.</p>
<p>“In Porirua, rangatahi aren’t going to have to book an appointment with their GP, join a long queue, and then fork out around $150 for critical support that could save their life.</p>
<p>“Having travelled across the country speaking to young people about mental ill health, I know that this pilot is the starting point for transformational mental healthcare in this country. I’m so happy that from today, the youth of Porirua will be able to get the help they need when they need it.</p>
<p>“I look forward to working with New Zealand First and Labour to further extend these trials”.</p>
