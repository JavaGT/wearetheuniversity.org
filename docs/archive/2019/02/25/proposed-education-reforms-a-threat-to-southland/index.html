<p>Sarah Dowie - MP for Invercargill</p>
<p>25 February 2019</p>
<p>Invercargill MP Sarah Dowie is concerned the formation of Education Hubs could mean the power school boards currently have over the governance of Invercargill and wider Southland school will go to Christchurch and Dunedin.</p>
<p>“The formation of a one size fits all approach of 20 hubs across the whole country doesn’t recognise the different interests communities in New Zealand have.</p>
<p>“While there is no detail on where the hub locations would be, if you look at the population of New Zealand it’s pretty clear some large parts of the country will be left with a hub some distant to certain communities. The needs of an isolated island like Stewart Island are very different to even Invercargill.</p>
<p>“I believe strongly that Southland parents and teachers are best placed to assess and deliver the education needs of our students.</p>
<p>“There may be some things in the review that could benefit Invercargill and wider, such as improving the management of school property and supporting children with additional learning needs.</p>
<p>“But the shift towards centralisation of schools across the board erodes our autonomy, stifles innovation in the classroom and would disempower community in our schools.</p>
<p>“I am also concerned about the proposed vocational reforms and the mega merger with its potential impact on SIT. They also move our system in a direction of greater centralisation.</p>
<p>“The last time Labour conducted an education review in Invercargill our school system was decimated, resulting in mass school closures and students being displaced. In true Education Minister Chris Hipkins style, the consultation period is rushed and consultation meetings have been poorly advertised.</p>
<p>“It’s important to have a say in this review, we need to protect our education system in Southland and make sure our children get the very best opportunities they can in the South.”</p>
<p>Note to editors:</p>
<p>Sarah Dowie is hosting National’s Education spokesperson Nikki Kaye in Invercargill on Friday 1 March. A public meeting will be held at Windsor Community Church Hall at 4pm.</p>
<p>A flyer advertising this meeting has gone into every mailbox and letters have been sent advising of the meeting to teachers, principals and board members.</p>
