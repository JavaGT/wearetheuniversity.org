<p>Oil and gas ban needs ‘recalibration’</p>
<p>A new report shows just how much damage the Government’s naïve oil and gas ban will do to the economy and to New Zealanders’ back pockets, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>Economic consultancy NZIER has found the policy could cost the economy up to $30 billion by 2050 and cost 3000 jobs but will have an “undetectable” contribution to reducing global emissions.</p>
<p>“The oil and gas ban is one of a multitude of nice-sounding but naïve, hard-left policies that will make New Zealanders worse off.</p>
<p>“A capital gains tax, industry-wide collective bargaining, and the highest minimum wage in the OECD, among various other proposals, will hurt the very people they are trying to help.”</p>
<p>“The oil and gas industry creates thousands of jobs, contributes $2.5 billion to the economy and $500 million to the government in royalties each year. Not only will this policy make us poorer, it will drive production of oil and gas overseas, harming the environment.</p>
<p>“The decision to ban offshore exploration was made without cost-benefit analysis or consultation – it was ultimately a political decision that was intended to make people feel good.</p>
<p>“Jacinda Ardern recently ‘recalibrated’ the KiwiBuild programme. This ban will be significantly more destructive than Phil Twyford’s tinkering. If there is a policy that needs remedying, it’s this one.”</p>
