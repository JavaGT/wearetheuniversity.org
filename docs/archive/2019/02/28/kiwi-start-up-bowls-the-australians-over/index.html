<p>Cutting-edge technology aimed at minimising waste in the food processing industry has received major recognition at Australia’s largest agricultural technology event.</p>
<p>Dr Matthew Jones, of Christchurch start-up company CertusBio, took home the top cash prize of $20,000 in the Investment Ready Pitch Tent competition of the inaugural EvokeAg event in Melbourne.</p>
<p>The Christchurch-based innovator was one of five finalists from Australia, New Zealand and Israel. The participants pitched their agricultural challenges, solutions and business ideas over the two-day event to a panel of expert venture capitalist judges.</p>
<p>Strong attendance of 1,100 delegates at the event showed an increasing international interest in new agtech technologies, including sensors, artificial intelligence, robotics and automation.</p>
<p>Dr Jones’ winning concept is an automated technology that reduces industrial food waste by 40 per cent. CertusBio commercialised the solution, which was developed by the Lincoln University-owned multidisciplinary R&amp;D company, Lincoln Agritech Ltd.</p>
<p>Dr Jones said that with 2-3 per cent of all processed milk disappearing down the drain, the dairy industry loses a staggering NZ$12.8 billion per year globally.</p>
<p>“CertusBio is transforming industrial food production to prevent this type of waste,” he said.</p>
<p>“Our solution saves money for processors and helps them meet their social responsibility to safeguard the environment for future generations.”</p>
<p>The technology includes a biosensor device that provides real-time insights into when food is wasted, a dashboard giving company managers unprecedented visibility on losses and a dedicated consultant to optimise food production.</p>
<p>“The solution can be installed without interruption to existing processes,” Dr Jones said.</p>
<p>“Other companies have been in the market a long time but do not provide accurate enough information to prevent this type of food waste.”</p>
<p>Dr Jones said he developed CertusBio to combine two of his great passions – the reduction of waste and the development of great science.</p>
<p>He is now seeking an investment of $2 million to meet the demand of customers in the international dairy industry and grow the CertusBio team.</p>
<p>“I’m looking for investors who care about reducing waste using validated technology in the food processing industry.”</p>
