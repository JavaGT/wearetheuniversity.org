<p>Higher landfill levy another broken promise, Government’s eighth tax</p>
<p>“A plan to increase the landfill levy six-fold is the eighth time the Government has broken Jacinda Ardern’s promise to introduce no new taxes”, according to ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“In September 2017, then-Labour Leader Jacinda Ardern said a government she led would not introduce any new taxes.</p>
<p>“A increase in the landfill levy follows higher fuel taxes, a regional fuel tax, higher road user charges, extending the ‘bright line test’ to five years, ringfencing rental losses, a visitor tax, and higher tobacco taxes.</p>
<p>“By 2021, the average household will be paying about $2,800 more in tax each year to pay for Labour&#39;s spending promises. That’s almost three weeks’ wages for someone on the median income. Hardworking taxpayers are bearing the cost of this Government’s reckless tax and spend approach.</p>
<p>“Increasing the landfill levy is a terrible idea. Councils should be free to charge for landfill on a cost recovery basis, rather than being dictated to by central government as a means to change behaviour.</p>
<p>“ACT is the only political party committed to cutting taxes. We would introduce a single, flat tax rate of 17.5 per cent on all individual and company income.</p>
<p>“Freedom to Earn would cut the overall tax burden by $10 billion, achieved by reducing wasteful and low-value spending like handouts for business and middle-class university students, and creating the fairest, simplest, most competitive tax system in the world.”</p>
