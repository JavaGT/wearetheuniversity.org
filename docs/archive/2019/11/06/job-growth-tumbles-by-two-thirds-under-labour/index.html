<p>Paul Goldsmith - Finance</p>
<p>6 November 2019</p>
<p>Rising unemployment figures released today show job growth is stalling under Labour&#39;s economic mismanagement, National’s Finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s job boom is a distant memory following the release of the latest Household Labour Force Survey from Statistics New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;Low business confidence is now flowing through into a weakening labour market.</p>
<p>&quot;In the last two years of the National Government, new jobs were created at a hectic pace of 10,000 per month. Under the first two years of this Labour Government, it&#39;s only 10,000 per quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a massive slowdown in hiring by companies is bad news for students looking to enter the labour market as well as families looking to get ahead by moving into a more rewarding job.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of slowing job growth, the unemployment rate also rose to 4.2 per cent.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a real warning sign that companies just cannot afford to hire new workers like they used to.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government&#39;s policies are hurting key sectors of our economy, even when New Zealand&#39;s international terms of trade are near record highs.</p>
<p>&quot;This is limiting how quickly companies can expand or export their products and services to the world.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders are paying the price for Labour lacking any sort of plan for growth. They cannot afford this Government.&quot;</p>
