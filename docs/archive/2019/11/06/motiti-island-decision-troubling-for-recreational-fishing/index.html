<p><strong>Wednesday, 6 November 2019, 8:13 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The decision to allow regional councils to manage fishing restrictions under the Resource Management Act sets a dangerous precedent, National’s Fisheries spokesperson Ian McKelvie says.</p>
<p>“The Court of Appeal has given local councils the ability to use the Resource Management Act to control fishing off the back of an appeal from environmentalists on Motiti Island.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of thousands of recreational fishers’ access has been put at risk as regional councils now have the ability to ban fishing.</p>
<p>“Elected officials in regional councils will now come under significant pressure to put in place restrictions and bans which will take away the rights of everyday New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“These powers should remain the prerogative of central government and the Minister needs to intervene to ensure this remains the case.</p>
<p>“One of the great privileges of being a New Zealander is the ability to get out on the water and put a line out. We need to carefully reconsider any rulings that prevent that from occurring.</p>
<p>“The National Party accepts the need to carefully preserve all forms of marine biodiversity in a sustainable and practical manner. But decisions that are going to affect our recreational and commercial fishers so severely should be made with appropriate thought and caution.</p>
<p>“The Government needs to change the law urgently and give certainty to recreational fishers, and if they won’t a National Government will.”</p>
