<p>Banks need to take a different approach to lending to farmers, new Lincoln University research says.</p>
<p>Research report* authors Bruce Greig, Dr Peter Nuthall and Dr Kevin Old found skills, attitudes and knowledge a person has in managing and operating a farm should be considered when assessing whether a loan should be given.</p>
<p>Dr Nuthall said banks use historic business statistics, and equity levels, to assess loans and credit worthiness.</p>
<p>“A farm manager’s personal characteristics are likely to be a better predictor of future debt payback performance,” he said.</p>
<p>“They have a lifetime of education and experience. A farmer’s objectives, and that of their associated household, can be considered part of the human capital which should be considered including attitudes to risky situations and their originating factors.”</p>
<p>The trio used data from a sample of New Zealand farm owner/operators to come up with a model, which they tested with data from a postal survey.</p>
<p>“The results make it clear a manager’s personal characteristics are highly correlated</p>
<p>with debt payback and, logically, are very likely to be the drivers.”</p>
<p>Dr Nuthall said it was also important to note the human characteristics that are related to payback can potentially be modified and improved.</p>
<p>“Counselling and psychotherapy can have very positive impacts and are likely to change a manager’s basic characteristics.”</p>
<p>“This is a positive approach which might be used when difficulties first surface preventing further problems. However, the manager must be prepared to cooperate in positive action which will then have lasting impacts.</p>

<p>“This is in contrast to short-term fire sale action.”</p>
<p>Dr Nuthall said overall, the research has shown, as logically could be expected, that a farm manager’s personal characteristics impinge on the debt payback decisions.</p>
<p>“Traditional financial measures reflect history, and the variables explored here reflect the future. In the future, credit scoring models should embrace farmers’ personal characteristics.”</p>
