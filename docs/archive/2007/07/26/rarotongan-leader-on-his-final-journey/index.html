<p>Rarotongan Leader on His Final Journey</p>
<p>Dr Pita Sharples and Tariana Turia, Co-leaders of the Maori Party</p>
<p>Thursday 26 July 2007</p>
<p>The Maori Party has today acknowledged the loss to the people of the Cook Islands of a great Pacific leader, a great voyager, a scholar, and a health advocate.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Thomas Davis, Pa Tuterangi Ariki, was a distinguished stateman who will be greatly mourned by the peoples of Rarotonga&quot; said Tariana Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;We remember him as a committed health practitioner - having the honour of being the first Cook Islands medical graduate (from Otago University in 1945)&quot; said Mrs Turia. &quot;He then went on to complete a Masters degree in public health at Harvard before achieving significant heights as a research physiologist&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;His legacy is demonstrated in the way he influenced the health system in the Cooks&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;His spirit of adventure was evident in his decision to work with NASA to work on the space programme&quot; said Dr Sharples. &quot;And we are particularly proud that in more recent times he became an honorary Professor of Polynesian Migration and Culture with Te Wananga o Aotearoa&quot;.</p>
<p>It was at this time that Sir Davis designed and supervised the construction of a 24 metre voyaging canoe for Te Wananga o Aotearoa.</p>
<p>&quot;It seemed that whatever he turned his mind to - he would achieve great things&quot; said Dr Sharples. &quot;He was awarded Sportsman Achiever of the Year in Yachting (1998) and in 1999, recognised by the New Zealand Achievers Magazine as &#39;Pacific Islander of the Century&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;His leadership was in many spheres of influence&quot; said Dr Sharples. &quot;After his time as Prime Minister - when others would think about retiring - he became High Commissioner of the Cook Islands and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 2005&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;And of course the significance of Sir Thomas Davis will be long remembered in founding the Cook Islands Democratic Party &quot; said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>&quot;We express our most sincere sympathies to all of his whanau in Rarotonga and across the world&quot; said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>E te Rangatira, haere ki to iwi, haere ki o tatou tupuna, haere ki to whanau. Haere ki te Kainga tuturu mo te tangata. Aue! Te Pouri! Te Tangi e! Haere, Haere, Haere!</p>
