<p><strong>Thursday, 26 July 2007, 5:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Bill English MP National Party Deputy Leader</p>
<p>26 July 2007</p>
<p>Labour wants its critics on a register</p>
<p>National Party Deputy Leader Bill English says Labour&#39;s plans for electoral reform include a provision that would force its critics to register with the Government if they plan to spend more than $5000 criticising any aspect of Government policy during the whole of election year.</p>
<p>&quot;It is yet another manifestation of the paranoia that has become entrenched in Helen Clark&#39;s third term.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr English says $5000 would only be enough to cover one mail drop in a small New Zealand town.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, the full page advertisements placed in national newspapers by teacher unions today would wipe out half of their total allowable spend in election year.</p>
<p>&quot;There would be riots on the forecourt at Parliament if National told unions they would be banned from placing any more than two advertisements in newspapers during election year.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr English says the changes being proposed by Labour are anti-democratic and tilt the playing field in the Labour Government&#39;s favour.</p>
<p>&quot;While everyone else won&#39;t be allowed to spend any more than a few thousand dollars, Labour will be free to use multi-million dollar departmental advertising budgets to promote Government policies.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr English says Labour should have consulted widely before introducing legislation that satisfies no one.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s kicked all of the hard decisions about tougher enforcement and sanctions past the next election. Labour&#39;s changing the rules to suit itself, and equipping no one to police them.&quot;</p>
