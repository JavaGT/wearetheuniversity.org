<p>99 Percent of Principals Back Pay Claim to Attract and Retain School Leaders</p>
<p>Ninety nine percent of principals attending paid union meetings this month voted in favour of a $35 million claim for fairer pay and paid sabbatical leave. The claim will be presented to the Ministry of Education by education union NZEI Te Riu Roa on Wednesday July 4th.</p>
<p>It seeks to redesign principals&#39; salary scale to make it more equitable and transparently fair. Depending on the size of school, principals would receive a pay increase of between 5% and 18%. The increase would also reinstate a sensible margin between the base salary of a small school principal and the top rate of a classroom teacher. A further 4% increase per year for the second and third years of the proposed agreement is also sought, along with 200 sabbatical leave positions of 10 weeks durations, up from a current 40 such sabbatical positions.</p>
<p>NZEI President Irene Cooper says the claim was strongly supported by principals nationally. &quot;This is a significant claim in response to a major problem with the recruitment and retention of principals. If we cannot attract and recruit good people to be school leaders, our internationally respected schooling system and our students&#39; learning will suffer.&quot;</p>
<p>Recent NZEI research shows that over a third (39 percent) of the 90 schools advertising for a principal in the Ecucation Gazette over the past six months had to advertise more than once. Some small rural schools were forced to advertise more than four times.</p>
<p>Supporting on-going learning by principals is also a key aspect of the claim.</p>
<p>&quot;There was overwhelming support for increasing opportunities for professional learning by principals around the country,&quot; Ms Cooper says. &quot;All the research shows that investing in school leadership is fundamental to ensuring we maintain and enhance quality public education in the 21st century.&quot;</p>
