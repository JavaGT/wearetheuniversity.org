<p>Kudos for top annual report</p>
<p>A national award for the best annual report by a tertiary education institution has been won by The University of Auckland.</p>
<p>The NZ Institute of Chartered Accountants bestowed the accolade as part of its 2007 Annual Report Awards. There were three finalists in the Best Tertiary Institution category, with the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic receiving a commendation.</p>
<p>The University of Auckland’s win was “well deserved”, said the judges. Its 2006 Annual Report had “provided a comprehensive set of information that displayed, in a very readable narration, a clear sense of what the organisation does. Its statements of service performance were well linked to its objectives with a good balance of both qualitative and quantitative information.”</p>
<p>Research was a strong focus of the University Annual Report for 2006.</p>
<p>The Annual Report Awards aim to promote better communication to stakeholders of financial and business information, compliance with legislative requirements and generally accepted accounting practice, and public awareness of enterprises, how they function and their achievements. The awards are open to all companies and institutions that produce an annual report.</p>
