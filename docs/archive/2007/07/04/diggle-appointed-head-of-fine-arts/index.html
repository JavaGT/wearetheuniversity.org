<p>Diggle appointed Head of Fine Arts</p>
<p>Professor Jeremy Diggle has been appointed the Head of the School of Fine Arts at the Wellington campus.</p>
<p>Professor Sally Morgan, Pro Vice-Chancellor of the College of Creative Arts, says Professor Diggle’s appointment strengthens the school’s highly-ranked teaching and research status.</p>
<p>A graduate of St Martin’s School of Art and the Royal College of Art in London, Professor Diggle’s previous position was Associate Dean of Research and Professor of Fine Art at the University of Plymouth, England.</p>
<p>His artistic career started in the late 1970s as a performance artist and video maker.</p>
<p>In addition to his teaching, English-born Professor Diggle is a respected artist working across a variety of media, including holography, photography, video and multimedia. He has established an international reputation for his use of technology and highly crafted narrative work. He is known as a storyteller, who continues the tradition of oral narrative and has developed this aspect of his work through the web and hypertext.</p>
<p>Recent projects include Hand held, an internal photographic landscape narrative related to the Auckland War Memorial Museum, exhibited at the New Zealand High Commission, London, in 2005; and Alkemi, an exhibition and keynote lecture at Columbia University, New York.</p>
<p>Professor Diggle takes up his appointment next month.</p>
