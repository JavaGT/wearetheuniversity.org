<p>For immediate release</p>
<p>Student press challenges anti-satire rules</p>
<p>Members of the Aotearoa Student Press Association [ASPA] are joining with the Parliamentary Press Gallery in speaking out against anti-satire rules recently imposed by the New Zealand government.</p>
<p>Under the new rules it is now illegal to make use of in-house footage which satirises or denigrates Members of Parliament, including both video and still images.</p>
<p>National Secretary of the Association Rory MacKinnon says the restrictions are &quot;ridiculous in their premise, but terrifying in their implications&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr. Cullen has said MPs will interpret the rules liberally, which is to say that our leaders have pretty wide powers of discretion in deciding what is and isn&#39;t satire. In the event that someone is convicted, the inevitable gag orders will ban the media from even reporting on the suppression of material.&quot;</p>
<p>MacKinnon also says that student media are unlikely to adopt Cullen&#39;s recommendation to &#39;wait and see&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Student media has a long history of both satire and political activism. We have a legacy of going where commercial publications fear to tread, especially on issues of freedom of speech. I would be very surprised if our member publications rolled over without a fight.&quot;</p>
<p>MacKinnon has declined to comment on rumours of a nationwide &quot;week of shame&quot; co-ordinated by the Association, but says he hopes to see a repeal of the rules rather than a crackdown on civil disobedience.</p>
<p>&quot;Our MPs have said that the public need to be able to trust them. We would suggest that they consider doing their job properly, rather than censoring our journalists.&quot;</p>
