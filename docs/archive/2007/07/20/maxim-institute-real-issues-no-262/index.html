<p><strong>BLOGGING BLURS THE INFORMATION LINES</strong></p>
<p>According to the Wall Street Journal, blogging is now 10 years old. Arguably it ranks third only to the invention of the printing press and the internet in the impact it has had on the communications&#39; world. With the arrival of the printing press information was able to flow down to the masses but the blog, in combination with the many other forms of digital communication, has broken down crucial barriers in the way information flows.</p>
<p>The most valuable commodity today is information -- the rise of &#39;spin doctors&#39; bears eloquent testimony to the power of the information-mongers. In the past this source of power has been able to be controlled and evaluated by traditional &#39;gate-keeping&#39; institutions like governments, industry and the commercial media. Gradually though, the world of the blog is dispersing this centre of power, a trend which is scaring some and thrilling others.</p>
<p>Traditional sources of information are trusted because they have earned it. They are responsible for the quality and validity of the information they pass on. A government needs to pass on information to govern effectively. A newspaper needs to be accurate to keep their reputation; a loss of reputation will result in a loss of readers and consequently revenue. A lying blogger just starts a new account.</p>
<p>However, the electronic media can help keep the traditional media honest. The ability of an individual sitting at home with their computer to transmit information to millions of people with nothing more than a few clicks and keystrokes provides an excellent, if irascible watch-dog. A cover-up is now a very difficult task.</p>
<p>While this extra layer of security may relieve some, combined with the postmodern trend to view all opinions as equally valid, blogging also has a more concerning side. If it is to genuinely provide us with more information, then blogging relies on our ability to filter information and discern truth. But in an age so skeptical of experts and authority, can we really put blogging to good use?</p>

<p><strong>UNPOPULAR SCHOOLS FEEL THE PINCH</strong></p>
<p>Several high schools in Christchurch are struggling to fill their classrooms with students, a phenomenon which, according to The Press, is due to parents preferring to send their children to schools that have higher numbers of &#39;middle-class white-background kids.&#39; Some allege these parents would rather their children were educated in middle-class company, even if it means bypassing their local schools. Such claims are misleading, and fail to consider other significant factors that may influence a parent&#39;s choice, such as the quality of teaching or the discipline record of a school.</p>
<p>Regardless of zoning laws which attempt to regulate attendance numbers, the actual numbers on school rolls are unbalanced. Several high schools are running at well below capacity, while others are stretched to a maximum, and are faced with turning away numerous students.</p>
<p>The article suggests that the sole reason for this increasing problem is &#39;white flight,&#39; with parents obviously preferring to send their children to school with the rich white kids. Such a suggestion is disingenuous. Parents select the best school for their child for a whole raft of reasons: examination results, the quality of the teachers, the range of subjects offered or the school&#39;s reputation on discipline.</p>
<p>To label Christchurch parents as racists or to allege prejudice is unfair, by and large parents want the best education possible for their children. If this means driving past one school to reach another with a higher standard of teaching, then it is inevitable that many parents will do this. Schools that are being overlooked should not simply bemoan the fact in the media. They need to examine whether there are improvements they could be making to encourage parents to send their kids to them.</p>
<p>The article suggests that zoning laws be tightened to provide a greater deterrent to parents avoiding certain schools. Such a solution however treats the symptom and not the cause; it may help to balance the rolls, but will not help fix the actual problem and lead to an overall improvement in educational standards. Until all schools can offer equally high standards of education, parents will continue to make choices that leave some schools unpopular. The choice of the right school is about quality and outcome, not class or race.</p>

<p><strong>OBAMA FLIRTS WITH THE MASSES</strong></p>
<p>As New Zealand considers revisions to its electoral finance laws, looking to Senator Barack Obama&#39;s campaign in the United States might provide us with a clue.</p>
<p>According to The New York Times, Obama has raised US$58.4 million in the first six months, more than any of the other candidates vying for their party&#39;s nomination for the US Presidential election. Rather than staging a traditional fundraising campaign, Obama has gone to the grassroots level, encouraging the enthusiasm and support of those who count most -- everyday American voters at the grassroots.</p>
<p>Obama has developed a new style of campaigning; instead of looking only to wealthy donors, he has flirted with the masses, using his &#39;celebrity&#39; status to raise a hefty sum of campaign money. His campaign is characterised by colourful online &#39;Donate Now&#39; buttons, ticket sales to campaign events, and the sale of paraphernalia such as caps, t-shirts and key chains. Supporters are encouraged to send solicitation emails to all their friends, gathering him further support. The result is the creation of a bigger buzz around his campaign, and around the grassroots involvement of &#39;regular&#39; people.</p>
<p>While the American system of campaign funding has its own series of problems and we should not wholeheartedly endorse all aspects of it, Obama&#39;s campaign points to something significant. It has brought many communities in America alongside him, allowing people to become part of something bigger, persuading the community, as politics should, of a vision, a passion and a cause. Our politicians need not turn themselves into superstars -- although some may try by appearing on certain reality TV shows -- New Zealand political parties could be taking notes from this new way of campaigning, one which sees the grassroots not as a necessary annoyance, but the life blood of the body politic. Democracy means the involvement of everyone in our society, and democratic participation can take much greater forms than simply ticking a box on election day. By engaging with the public on a deeper level for funding, political parties help individuals to feel an increased sense of ownership and a greater commitment to the process. That&#39;s what democracy is all about.</p>
<p><strong>IN THE NEWS</strong></p>
<p><strong>PARLIAMENT GOES LIVE</strong></p>
<p>Parliament has taken a step into the cyber-world. The sittings of the House can now be viewed live from their website. At the small cost of $1.8 million a year to the taxpayer, it is now possible to watch as our Members of Parliament debate and argue -- and perhaps sleep -- in the Parliamentary Chamber.</p>

<p>ACTING AGAINST SLAVE LABOUR</p>
<p>Trade Aid New Zealand is circulating a petition, which seeks to pass legislation to ban any products coming into New Zealand that have been made using slave labour. Trade Aid argues that, as a country that places importance on the rights of workers, New Zealand should be careful not to purchase products made using the labour of exploited workers. According to Trade Aid, &#39;slavery could be in the sugar in your soft drink, the cocoa in your chocolate, the rubber in your car tyres, the fireworks you watch and [the] matches that light them.&#39; It is unclear whether such legislation would be practically possible or enforceable, but becoming better informed about where our products are made, and the human cost of consumption is a first step to reducing slave labour, which remains a burning issue in far too many of our trading markets.</p>

<p>**JAPAN PAVES THE WAY FOR COURTROOM CHANGES<br>**</p>
<p>The currents of change are strengthening in Japan as the country&#39;s courts move towards a more western style trial system. The new system, to be brought in as of May 2009, can be thought of as an amalgamation of a high court and a jury and will be comprised of three professionally trained judges and six lay judges (known as &#39;Saiban-in&#39;) taken from the electoral roll. The role of the combined court will be to rule on both verdicts and sentences for serious criminal cases. An education programme has been started which runs mock trials to rectify the strong tendency of the lay judges to defer to the professional judges. This is a function of the strong status system that exists in Japanese culture, and will need to be addressed for the new system to be effective.</p>
<p><strong>TALKING POINT</strong></p>
<p>&#39;Think of blogging as a DIY movement in our always intertwined media and political culture, blurring the lines between professional producers (news organizations and politicians) and amateur consumers (citizens).&#39;</p>
