<p>Wages Still on the Rise – Employment Agreements Seminars</p>
<p>The 2007 update on New Zealand wages and conditions will be released at a series of seminars being held in late July and early August by Victoria University&#39;s Industrial Relations Centre.</p>
<p>The latest information shows a continuation of last year’s upward trend in wage settlements in collective agreements.</p>
<p>The Employment Agreements: Bargaining Trends &amp; Employment Law Update seminar series has established a reputation as the definitive source of practitioner-focused information on current wages, conditions, and employment relations practices in New Zealand. Topics covered in the seminars will include wages, working time and leave, work-life balance, and skills development.</p>
<p>Professor George Lafferty, Director of the Centre, says the seminar will contain a comprehensive review of wages and employment conditions contained in collective employment agreements from across New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The review will highlight prevailing wages and conditions in a full range of industries, occupations, and sectors of the economy. This year, industry-based research identifying key issues affecting the development of New Zealand’s workforce will also be presented.</p>
<p>“The last two years have seen the largest average wage increase since the Centre began its seminars in the early 1990s. This upward trend seems set to continue in the immediate future, with recent agreements showing no easing of pressure for wage increases.”</p>
<p>The seminar series will be held in Christchurch on 31 July; Dunedin on 2 August; Hamilton on 8 August, Auckland on 10 August, Wellington on 15 August, and Napier on 17 August.</p>
