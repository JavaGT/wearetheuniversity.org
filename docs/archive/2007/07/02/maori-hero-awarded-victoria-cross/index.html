<p>From Mangakino to Afghanistan: Maori hero awarded Victoria Cross</p>
<p>Dr Pita Sharples and Tariana Turia; Co-leaders Maori Party</p>
<p>Monday 2 July 2007</p>
<p>Maori Party co-leaders, Dr Pita Sharples and Tariana Turia today expressed enormous pride in the distinguished award honouring the bravery of Corporal Bill (Willy) Henry Apiata.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister announced this morning that the Queen has approved the award of the Victoria Cross to Corporal Apiata for his courage onfield in Afghanistan in 2004.</p>
<p>“Willy Apiata will be celebrated by Ngapuhi nui tonu; by Whanau a Apanui; and indeed by all tangata whenua today, for receiving the incredible achievement of the Victoria Cross” said Tariana Turia, Co-leader of the Maori Party.</p>
<p>“In fact, I know in Te Tai Hauauru we take particular pride that it must have been his early days in Mangakino which paved the way for the exceptional courage demonstrated by Corporal Apiata&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“All New Zealanders can be proud of the leadership demonstrated by Corporal Apiata, in carrying an injured soldier to safety, whilst under fierce and prolonged attack” said Dr Pita Sharples.</p>
<p>“We mihi too, to the other three SAS soldiers who whilst unable to be named, have exhibited great strength in their actions in Afghanistan, as recognised by the gallantry decorations they will receive” said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>“Corporal Apiata is known as inspiring his peers, and serving above the call of duty throughout his military career” said Mrs Turia. “With this award today, we now know that his courage has been recognised by the Queen as worthy of the supreme award for valour”.</p>

<p>“What’s more, is that with this award, Corporal Apiata becomes one of only thirteen living recipients of the Victoria Cross – and the only New Zealander in that group” said Mrs Turia. &quot;We also remember at this time the only other Maori soldier to receive the Victoria Cross, Second Lieutenant Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa Ngarimu of Whanau a Apanui and Ngati Porou”.</p>
<p>“Corporal Apiata has demonstrated that extraordinary quality of being prepared to sacrifice his own safety, in order to save the life of his comrade” said Mrs Turia. “Aotearoa can be truly proud of the honour he, and the other three members of the SAS awarded gallantry medals, brings to our nation”.</p>
<p>“The Maori Party is delighted to stand with all other New Zealanders, in congratulating Corporal Apiata, and Corporal B, C and R; for their remarkable heroism and acts of bravery” ended Dr Sharples. “The leadership exhibited by these four individuals is something every New Zealander should take great pride in”.</p>
