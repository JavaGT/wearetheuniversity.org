<p>Maharey rearranges the deck chairs</p>
<p>The review of the TVNZ Charter is going to do nothing to disguise the abysmal failure of Steve Maharey&#39;s broadcasting policy, says National Party Broadcasting spokesman Jonathan Coleman.</p>
<p>TVNZ has announced today that the process for reviewing the charter is underway.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course the Charter was Steve Maharey&#39;s baby, and it&#39;s no surprise that he will want to sidetrack the broadcasting debate into a discussion on the feel-good nature of the Charter, rather than focus on the real financial problems facing TVNZ.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing against which the Charter&#39;s objectives can be measured, and redrafting it is unlikely to make any difference to what the public sees on their television screens.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey is on record saying that he looked forward to the Charter delivering all sorts of things. The reality is that his broadcasting policy has made nobody happy.</p>
<p>“He has saddled TVNZ with a dual remit that is making life hell for anyone working at the state broadcaster, and he would be hard pressed to show any difference the Charter has made to programming.</p>
<p>&quot;This review of the Charter is unlikely to excite anybody but academics and officials.</p>
<p>&quot;What Minister Maharey would be far better to concentrate on would be coming up with a workable broadcasting policy that will survive the digital challenge.”</p>
