<p><strong>Thursday, 5 July 2007, 10:14 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Students’ Association Revamps to Retain Relevance</p>
<p>The Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) is undergoing a major rebranding and strategic planning exercise in order to remain relevant to its student members.</p>
<p>Act MP Heather Roy currently has a private members’ bill in the ballot which would make all students’ associations in New Zealand voluntary. OUSA has taken strategic planning and rebranding measures to safeguard against the eventuality of such a bill being passed, by ensuring that they are so relevant to their members that the vast majority of students would join under a voluntary system.</p>
<p>“OUSA is a dynamic organisation that is student-led and works for our members – students,” says OUSA President Renee Heal. “We provide relevant services and essential representation to students at Otago. It is important that we communicate this effectively to our members so that they understand exactly what it is that OUSA does for them. The OUSA ReOrientation Launch is the first step in undertaking this.”</p>
<p>As part of the OUSA ReOrientation Launch, on Thursday July 12th OUSA is hosting a major festival to showcase to students the services the Association provides. This is to illustrate the relevance of OUSA’s services to students in a fun, accessible manner. The festival includes a free day at the OUSA Clubs and Societies Centre, stalls showcasing each OUSA department at the Radio One Market Day, an International Food Festival, giveaways of student necessities such as socks and soup mugs, and other ReOrientation Events including a Snowboarding Jam, the Inaugural OUSA Wearable Arts Awards, and a free gig.</p>
