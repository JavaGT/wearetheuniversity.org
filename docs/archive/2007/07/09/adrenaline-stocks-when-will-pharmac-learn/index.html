<p><strong>Monday, 9 July 2007, 9:38 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Adrenaline stocks – when will Pharmac learn?</p>
<p>News that Pharmac will de-list an alternative adrenaline from next month to rely on the original sole supplier - who was unable to supply this life-saving drug late last year - is extremely worrying, says National Party Associate Health spokeswoman Dr Jackie Blue.</p>
<p>“If it wasn’t for pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca coming to Pharmac’s rescue and sourcing an alternative adrenaline in January, the situation would have become extremely dire in New Zealand hospitals.</p>
<p>“Adrenaline is used in emergency, life and death situations. It is crucial that supplies of this drug are guaranteed.</p>
<p>“But now because of Pharmac&#39;s unilateral decision, AstraZeneca’s alternative adrenaline will no longer be available as a back-up.</p>
<p>“Pharmac clearly hasn’t learnt the lessons of the past that drugs stocks can become vulnerable and effectiveness can become an issue when there is just one supplier.”</p>
<p>In 2005 Pharmac introduced a sole supply contract with a generic salbutamol inhaler, Salamol, replacing Ventolin, which had been the cornerstone of asthma treatment for decades.</p>
<p>“There was a huge uproar and Pharmac backed down on its decision after receiving hundreds of complaints about the effectiveness, taste and delivery problems with the new inhaler.</p>
<p>“Later that year Pharmac had to abandon its single purchaser deal for winter flu vaccines after concerns over its effectiveness.</p>
<p>“This year we’ve had pharmacies running out of calcium tablets taken to prevent osteoporosis in post menopausal women because its sole supplier had been unable to meet demand.</p>
<p>“But it’s a situation which we could see increasingly. In Pharmac’s drive to reduce costs, the offer of sole supply contracts becomes attractive for manufacturers who sufficiently reduce their price.</p>
<p>“Just when will Pharmac learn that cost must be weighed up with quality and surety of supply?”</p>
