<p>John Key MP<br>National Party Leader</p>

<p>Research shows KidsCan programmes helping</p>
<p>National Party Leader John Key has welcomed Massey University research showing that low decile schools are seeing improvements in children’s self esteem, attendance and pride in their schools as a result of KidsCan programmes.</p>
<p>“KidsCan’s approach with the ‘foods for kids’ and ‘raincoats for kids’ programmes, are the type of initiatives National will back should it become the government.</p>
<p>“As I highlighted in my underclass speech at Burnside, children should not go to school constantly hungry. They can’t and don’t learn if they do.</p>
<p>“Helen Clark’s reaction to my speech was to deny that an underclass existed.</p>
<p>“KidsCan charitable trust operates programmes trying to help out students at low-decile schools. It distributes food each week to 6,000 hungry children and it has a waiting list of 10,000 children in need of help.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, under its ‘raincoats for kids’ programme, KidsCan has distributed 16,000 Adidas All Blacks-branded raincoats.</p>
<p>“I welcome this research, which makes it clear that the programmes offered by KidsCan are of real value to low-decile schools.</p>
<p>“The KidsCan example is another of the community approach to this issue that I was advocating.</p>
<p>“In government, National will be backing these sorts of programmes.”</p>
