<p>Major funding for Otago research programmes announced</p>
<p>University of Otago researchers have gained around $8m in funding to pursue two new research programmes, one on quantum technologies, and the other on therapies for age-related brain disorders.</p>
<p>The two new programmes were announced today by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology.</p>
<p>World-leading physicists at the University’s Jack Dodd Centre for Photonics and Ultra-Cold Atoms have gained $7.1m for their four-year research programme.</p>
<p>Led by Professor Crispin Gardiner, Associate Professor Andrew Wilson and Professor Rob Ballagh, the programme will develop new technologies based on research performed in the Jack Dodd Centre.</p>
<p>This proposal covers a range of activities spanning information and communications technologies and new materials, and will generate the knowledge and workforce that will enable the development and manufacture of novel high-value physical devices in New Zealand.</p>
<p>A key feature of this proposal is the production of graduates with cutting-edge technical skills.</p>
<p>Two New Zealand companies will be involved – the Otago-based Photonic Innovations Ltd and Southern Photonics Ltd, both of which are spin-offs from previous photonics research. Photonics is the science and technology of generating and controlling photons, or light particles.</p>
<p>The planned research is an integrated programme of experimental and theoretical investigations into methods for utilising atoms, molecules and laser light for applications in information and communications technologies and for the development of sought-after new materials.</p>
<p>Applying the tools of quantum physics research to problems of practical importance can overcome technical barriers associated with traditional approaches.</p>
<p>The programme builds on existing world-class capabilities, by developing a diverse range of entirely new ones on a large scale. A market assessment and an estimate of likely market share indicate that the potential economic benefits to New Zealand are very substantial.<br>The other programme involves researchers from the University’s Department of Anatomy and Structural Biology, who have gained funding to develop new therapies for age-related brain disorders.</p>
<p>The team, led by Associate Professor Ian McLennan and Dr Kyoko Koishi, will build on their earlier discovery that a protein called Mullerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS) plays a previously unsuspected role in maintaining cells in the brain.</p>
<p>Their programme, “Drugs for ageing” receives $962,500 over three years. It aims to identify age-related brain disorders in which declining amounts or lack of MIS plays a role and, specifically, at least one brain disorder which is likely to be responsive to treatment with MIS.</p>
<p>Associate Professor McLennan says gaining the funding is very pleasing and the assistance of the University’s commercialisation arm, Otago Innovation Limited has been invaluable.</p>
<p>The research team will continue to work closely with Otago Innovation in developing MIS as a therapy. Otago Innovation has been involved since early on in protecting the intellectual property for the benefit of the researchers and the University.</p>
<p>Otago Innovation Commercialisation Manager Hamish Findlay says “This programme represents a unique opportunity as our researchers have a worldwide competitive advantage in research on MIS”.</p>
