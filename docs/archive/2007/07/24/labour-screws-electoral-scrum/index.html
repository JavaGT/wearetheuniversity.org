<p>Bill English MP</p>
<p>National Party Deputy Leader</p>
<p>24 July 2007</p>
<p>Labour screws electoral scrum</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s election finance reform should be renamed the &#39;Save Labour Bill&#39; because it is so heavily weighted in favour of the Labour Government,&quot; says National Party Deputy Leader Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;The bill is drafted to drastically reduce election-year spending by Opposition parties and Labour critics. Labour wants strict rules and spending caps to cover the whole of election year, not just the three months before the election.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark and Michael Cullen are trying to control public opinion for almost a year running up to the 2008 election.</p>
<p>&quot;Meanwhile, Labour will be legally allowed to bombard voters with taxpayer-funded advertising.</p>
<p>&quot;It is no wonder that Labour is going to such great lengths to stack its departmental communications jobs with political appointments.&quot; Mr English says the bill needs much tougher sanctions.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour will be able to do exactly what it did last election - breach the spending limits by hundreds of thousands of dollars with no consequences because the sanctions are so weak.&quot;</p>
<p>He says the requirements for third-party advertising are draconian.</p>
<p>&quot;National opposes covert campaigns and the law already requires transparency. However, the law doesn&#39;t work because of the lack of sanctions.</p>
<p>&quot;Third parties should be required to reveal their identity but all other provisions are designed to block Labour&#39;s critics in 2008.</p>
<p>&quot;This legislation should be about fair and democratic elections, where Kiwis are encouraged to take part.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead, the party which produced the pledge card has now dreamed up a self-serving anti-democratic law designed to silence critics and save their own skins.&quot;</p>
