<p>Minister shrugs over complete rejection of his fire reforms</p>
<p>Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker appears not to give a damn that every single rural fire authority in the country has rejected his fire reforms out of hand, says National’s Internal Affairs spokeswoman, Sandra Goudie.</p>
<p>“What the Minister appears not to understand about consultation, is that it requires listening, not just presenting your own fait accompli”</p>
<p>At the 2007 Regional Rural Fire Committee Chairpersons’ Conference last month in Christchurch, Labour’s reforms of fire and rescue services were strongly rejected.</p>
<p>“This rejection was unanimous and came from the Chairpersons and Deputies of the eleven Regional Rural Fire Committees, the National Rural Fire Advisory Committee, and Rural Fire District representatives.</p>
<p>“For the Minister to blithely state that, if regions don’t like the idea of coming under the control of a new centrally-administered body, they can stick with the funding status quo, is disingenuous.</p>
<p>“He knows that councils struggle to fund rural fire units and, instead of offering them help, comes up with a grand takeover plan. Councils will save hundreds of thousands of dollars if they roll over and allow Wellington to run the show, but at what cost?</p>
<p>“Our rural volunteers are the backbone of this country’s fire fighting brigade. They are dedicated, hardworking and capable. Their local knowledge makes them invaluable.</p>
<p>“Even in the 2003 government briefing paper on a proposal to reform the sector, it was acknowledged that our network of fire fighters ranked extremely highly internationally.</p>
<p>“For Rick Barker to unilaterally dismiss the sector’s well-considered rejection of his grand plan is short-sighted and terribly, terribly dangerous.”</p>
