<p>Greens salute bravery of Corporal Apiata VC</p>
<p>The Green Party supported the motion in Parliament today to salute the bravery of Corporal Willy Apiata, and his receipt of the Victoria Cross.</p>
<p>&quot;We were happy to join other parties in the House in offering our congratulations to Corporal Willy Apiata,&quot; said Green Party Defence spokesperson, Keith Locke.</p>
<p>&quot;We think Corporal Apiata and his family will welcome the cross-party support, even though the Green Party did not support the commitment of SAS troops to Afghanistan,&quot; Mr Locke says.</p>
<p>&quot; The Greens still regard the American-led war in the south of Afghanistan as being fought with too little regard to civilian casualties. It has been a largely counterproductive conflict that is contributing most unfortunately, to a resurrection of the despicable Taliban.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the Greens do not see our criticism of the Afghan war as detracting in any way from our recognition of the bravery of Corporal Apiata.</p>
<p>&quot;Corporal Apiata is a credit to New Zealand, and to Maoridom. He carried out his duties to his unit with great heroism in the best tradition of Kiwi soldiers. We salute him, &quot; Mr Locke says.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
