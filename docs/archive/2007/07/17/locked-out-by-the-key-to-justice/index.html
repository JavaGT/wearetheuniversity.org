<p>Locked Out By The Key To Justice</p>
<p>Tariana Turia; Co-leader of the Maori Party;</p>
<p>Tuesday 17 July 2007</p>
<p>The Maori Party today expressed their disappointment that the National Party, while mouthing the rhetoric of equality before the law and access to justice, has acted against the interests of Maori in stating they will vote against the repeal of the Foreshore and Seabed Act.</p>
<p>&quot;This was always an issue about Injustice&quot; said Mrs Turia; who is sponsoring a Bill to repeal the Foreshore and Seabed Act, in order to restore to Maori their right to take their claims to court, and to test their ownership.</p>
<p>&quot;The remedy is access to justice - that is the solution&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeal judgment in the Ngati Apa case enabled Maori the opportunity to put forward a case at the Maori Land Court to claim freehold title of the foreshore and seabed.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour was the first to slam the door shut - their Act shut down due process; and vested ownership of the foreshore and seabed themselves - and in doing so denied their Treaty partners&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;And in the process, their actions and their Act divided New Zealand&quot; said Mrs Turia. &quot;New Zealanders - in their thousands - rejected the heavy-handed tactics of Labour. Maori, in particular, still see the nature of injustice of that policy. Policies of injustice are just not the New Zealand way&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We said we would repeal the Foreshore and Seabed Act. That was what our Bill does. It was our firm commitment to our people and we will do that&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;National had an opportunity to open the door to allow the discussion to take place as a nation&quot; said Mrs Turia. &quot;They had the opportunity to show they placed value in fairness; to enable the nation to return to a situation which enabled Maori access to the due process of law&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We sought the support of National to demonstrate leadership -they told us that they had &#39;nothing to fear&#39; from Maori; that they welcomed debate&quot; said Mrs Turia. &quot;We have always believed that support for the Bill to even advance to the select committee stage, would have been the common sense, honourable and principled position for parties to take&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand will interpret the lack of courage in allowing a debate of justice to take place as more of the same - whether the brand is Labour or National is irrelevant - the key message remains the same&quot; said Dr Sharples, Co-leader of the Maori Party.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s reluctance to support the Foreshore and Seabed Act (Repeal) Bill indicates that they perhaps lack the maturity and confidence to show leadership when it really counts. Despite what the polls may show, they are probably not ready to assume leadership as a collective&quot; said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s clear that Mr Key is a rising star - but what we know from his fear of acting now - is that something as significant that one law for all doesn&#39;t mean all New Zealanders&quot; ended Mrs Turia. &quot;This was never about politics - this is about trust; justice and leadership&quot;.</p>
