<p>Speech – EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY</p>
<p>An address by Rt Hon Winston Peters to a public meeting in Christchurch on Friday 06 July 2007 in the Games Room, Cashmere Club, 50 Colombo St, Cashmere at 12:30pm</p>
<p>&quot;Events&quot;.</p>
<p>It was former British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan who was once famously asked what kept him awake at night.</p>
<p>He replied, “Events, dear boy, events”.</p>
<p>There is nothing like an unexpected crisis or dealing with predictable, but unpalatable events to focus the minds of politicians.</p>
<p>We have had a number of events of late which have been great cause for concern to ordinary New Zealanders.</p>
<p>You see some New Zealanders are being kept awake at night because gangs are terrorising their neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>Even worse some are kept awake because our limp wristed PC system has meant that even when Housing New Zealand wants to kick gang families out, they can&#39;t.</p>
<p>This is outrageous.</p>
<p>Even worse, we have the unfortunate specter of gang apologist MPs telling us to let the gangs sort it out for themselves.</p>
<p>Well as we all know, the only thing gangs are sorting out is how to put more drugs and violence onto our streets and into our young people.</p>
<p>Their insidious practices and vile demeanor are a scourge on our society.</p>
<p>It is an image which Maoridom must shun and reject – rather than promote.</p>
<p>Maoridom is demeaned every time gangs, in all their paraphernalia, are blazoned across the six o&#39;clock news.</p>
<p>How much better it was to have a prime example of Maori success built on discipline and commitment in the form of Corporal Bill Apiata of the New Zealand SAS, who received a Victoria Cross this week.</p>

<p>A man far tougher than any gang member and yet a man of honour.</p>
<p>That is something Maoridom and all New Zealanders can take pride in.</p>
<p>The contrast is stark, and Corporal Apiata&#39;s success illustrates that Maori don&#39;t have to accept the gutter route of gangs to be tough – there are alternatives.</p>
<p>We have exporters who can&#39;t sleep at night because the high dollar is crippling them.</p>
<p>Some are being forced to make the gut-wrenching choice of having to close their doors and move offshore or even worse to close down altogether.</p>
<p>We have young people and their parents who stay awake wondering if they will ever be able to own their own home.</p>
<p>With sky-high interest rates and an immigration fuelled burgeoning house market, the prospect of young New Zealanders being able to own their own home gets fainter by the day.</p>
<p>Their parents are even more concerned that their children will actually abandon any hope of a future here in New Zealand and will join the hordes already overseas.</p>
<p>They wonder when and if they will ever get to see their grandchildren.</p>
<p>We have some in New Zealand who lie awake wondering how they will ever be able to pay their power bill.</p>
<p>With residential prices now 40% higher than they were five years ago, for some it has become a choice between heating and food.</p>
<p>This is terrible in a developed country such as ours.</p>
<p>We have some seniors stressed by the prospect of a National led government being cagey about stripping away their rights to increased superannuation and other policy developments.</p>
<p>National is developing the worst kind of split personality when it comes to critical policy matters.</p>
<p>John Key and Bill English have become the new &quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot; of New Zealand politics.</p>
<p>You see we have already heard John Key rather foolishly try and defend Fay and Richwhite and now we are left wondering just what his real agenda actually is.</p>
<p>We hear Bill English bemoaning how generous our retirement income is – signaling that National may look to curb some of this spending. Seniors are worried.</p>
<p>Bill English should trying living on New Zealand Superannuation for a few weeks – then let him say its generous.</p>
<p>National&#39;s record when it comes to our seniors is a disgrace and John Key&#39;s soothing words will mean nothing when Bill English and his cohorts of the past again argue cut superannuation as they did in 1998.</p>
<p>The biggest threat to National is not Helen Clark or Labour – it is the &quot;Jeckle and Hyde&quot; inside their own leadership.</p>
<p>And while this goes on, sadly we have too many politicians of all stripes turning their head the other way saying there is nothing they can do.</p>
<p>That is what makes New Zealand First different from the rest – we tackle the issues the others won&#39;t.</p>
<p>We aren&#39;t afraid to say, ban the gangs.</p>
<p>We aren&#39;t afraid to say, rewrite the Reserve Bank Act.</p>
<p>We aren&#39;t afraid to say that high immigration has created a housing crisis which is fuelling inflation and hurting our exporters through an outrageously high dollar.</p>
<p>We aren&#39;t afraid to say that our seniors need a fair deal and protection. And while it may cost us a little money it is money well spent.</p>
<p>We stay awake at night trying to find solutions to the real problems confronting ordinary New Zealanders.</p>
<p>Unlike other political parties, we have been prepared to offer more than lip service to ordinary New Zealanders.</p>
<p>You see we in New Zealand First live by a simple motto – some talk, some do.</p>
<p>And we have chosen to take the path of doing.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
