<p><strong>Friday, 6 July 2007, 11:26 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Strenthening Auckland</p>
<p>The scene for Auckland’s future was being set this week. Over the next few years, the waterfront will be transformed, and the security of Auckland’s power supply will be strengthened.</p>
<p>The Waterfront Redevelopment</p>
<p>The proposals to redevelop Wynyard Point have been generally welcomed. It’s a pity about the 25 year time frame, but that just highlights the need to fix Auckland governance.</p>
<p>A vibrant, people-focussed precinct will dramatically change the orientation of the city. There will be a much deeper focus on the western side of the city, with more accommodation, more office and commercial space, and expanded opportunities for the marine sector. The park at the seaward end of Wynyard Point is a potential site for an iconic building (not a stadium!) Such buildings are usually museums, art galleries or theatres – think of the Sydney Opera House. New Zealand does not have a credible national art gallery. Since Wellington already has Te Papa, a national art gallery in Auckland makes sense. The Guggenheim Gallery in Bilbao shows how a world class building can focus attention on a city.</p>
<p>One issue that is unresolved is cross harbour traffic. I have been an advocate for a cross harbour tunnel from the old toll plaza in Northcote to Wynyard Point. Transit sees this as the most credible crossing option. Integrating a crossing into the proposed Victoria Tunnel, with outlets into the city, will be a critical part of the development.</p>
<p>Electricity Supply Secured</p>

<p>The Electricity Commission’s proposal for new transmission links is a welcome boost to the security of Auckland’s electricity supply. It is clear that the existing system is very vulnerable to outages. This will only get worse as the city grows.</p>
<p>Auckland is 35% of New Zealand’s economy. Much of New Zealand’s export manufacturing is based in Auckland. Most large companies have their head offices in Auckland. Secure electricity in Auckland benefits the whole country.</p>
<p>These large infrastructure projects always have environmental effects. These obviously need to be mitigated, especially in densely populated areas. There is a very good case for undergrounding out to the Bombay Hills.</p>
<p>Many farmers will be adversely affected. Compensation should be generous. New Zealand has a historically poor record in dealing with property rights where public interests are involved. This time we should get it right, and ensure full and generous compensation is paid.</p>
