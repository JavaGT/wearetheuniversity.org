<p>18 July 2007</p>
<p>Multi-million dollar research funding announcement</p>
<p>Four University of Canterbury research projects have been awarded more than $7 million in new funding by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology.</p>
<p>The UC projects will investigate a range of areas from wood quality and the development of wood-polymer composites to augmented reality and spinal fusion.</p>
<p>Work led by Dr Mark Billinghurst (HITLab) will seek to develop Augmented Reality (AR) technology that can be used on common user devices such as mobile phones and desktop PCs.</p>
<p>AR is a technology that allows virtual imagery to be overlaid on the real world and can be used for engineering, education and entertainment purposes, among others.</p>
<p>In the past, a lack of suitable hardware and software has limited use of AR technology. The recent development and increased uptake of sophisticated mobile phone and computer technology has largely addressed the hardware issue and Dr Billinghurst’s team will work on the development of fundamental software for AR technology.</p>
<p>Dr Mark Staiger (Mechanical Engineering) is leading the development of an implantable metal alloy for spinal fusions that will break-down in the body.</p>
<p>The new alloy spinal fusion device (SFD) will provide a high-strength, bone-like stiffness not found in approved SFDs.</p>
<p>It is envisaged the new SFD will improve bone growth, vascularisation, cell viability and nutrient diffusion and will contribute to a reduction in spinal fusion failure rates.</p>

<p>Professor John Walker (Forestry) is the leader of a project which will investigate the fundamental controls on wood quality with a view to improving the quality of young timber.</p>
<p>The research will seek to understand and compare the bio-chemical and biomechanical properties of pinus radiata and eucalypt (a hardwood). It is envisaged this work will help increase returns for exported wood and wood products.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Shusheng Pang (Chemical and Process Engineering) will lead research into the development of new wood-polymer composites for use as building materials, using wood and recycled plastic.</p>
<p>This type of composite is more stable and durable than traditional wooden building materials and is being used increasingly internationally.</p>
<p>The researchers will also develop technologies to extract polymers from radiata pine to produce the composite.</p>
<p>Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor Ian Town, is delighted by today’s announcement.</p>
<p>“These are four extremely worthy projects and I congratulate our staff on their successes. This funding recognises the significant contributions the College of Engineering staff and their collaborators are making to New Zealand Science and the economy.&quot;</p>
