<p>New FoRST funding a `go forward´ delivery for science at Lincoln University</p>
<p>Lincoln University research teams are set to lead the way on smart seeds,<br>tourism policy and controlling nitrate pollution thanks to new funding of $13.2<br>million announced on 18 July by the Foundation for Research, Science and<br>Technology.</p>
<p>&quot;Financial support of this scale delivers a real `go forward´ element to these<br>projects and the teams and collaborators involved,&quot; says Lincoln University´s<br>Vice-Chancellor Professor Roger Field.</p>
<p>&quot;The areas funded demonstrate once again the strong `Lincoln University<br>factor´ as it relates to crucial contributions to the economy and to the<br>environment. The `Lincoln University factor´ was seen last month too in the<br>Government´s decision to renew and increase funding for the campus-based<br>Centre of Research Excellence.</p>
<p>&quot;Such continued funding clearly shows confidence in the distinctive, applied<br>and nationally relevant nature of Lincoln University´s research and the<br>industry partnerships we pursue.&quot;</p>
<p>Through the latest round of contracts the Foundation for Research, Science<br>and Technology is investing in the following scientific research at Lincoln<br>University:</p>
<p>o Professors Alison Stewart and John Hampton will lead a research<br>team, with AgResearch and Crop and Food Research, on smart seeds for<br>export (funded for $5.175 million over six years). Other investors in this<br>project are the Foundation for Arable Research, PGG Wrightson Seeds Ltd<br>and South Pacific Seeds (NZ) Ltd.</p>

<p>o Professors Keith Cameron and Hong Di will lead research on<br>nitrogen management in dairy pasture soils for environmental integrity<br>($5.462 million over six years) in partnership with AgResearch, Dexcel and<br>the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>o Associate Professor Susanne Becken will work with Covec Limited,<br>Landcare Research and the Ministry of Tourism to identify high yielding<br>adaptation measures in response to rising oil prices ($962,500 over three<br>years).</p>
<p>o Professor David Simmons will work with the Department of<br>Conservation and the Ministry of Tourism to develop a new sector model to<br>increase yield per visitor ($1.500 million over four years).</p>
<p>&quot;This investment by Government, and our well established partnerships with<br>industry, will contribute to both economic growth and environmental impact<br>across several sectors,&quot; says Professor Field, &quot;and we congratulate our<br>leading scientists on their initiative and dedication.&quot;</p>
<p>The four FoRST contracts for Lincoln announced this week join two others<br>for the University awarded earlier in the year $1.16 million over 28 months<br>for the development of &quot;smart bait&quot; technologies for pest control and $2<br>million over five years for a social research project investigating education<br>employment linkages. Lincoln University will also receive an additional $3<br>million of FoRST investment from a sub-contract with a CRI in the area of<br>bio-protection.</p>
<p>The total value of new research contracts secured from the Foundation for<br>Research, Science and Technology in 2007 is $19.3 million.</p>
