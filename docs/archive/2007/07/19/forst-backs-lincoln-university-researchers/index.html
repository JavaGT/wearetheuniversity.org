<p>FoRST backs Lincoln University researchers to reduce nitrate leaching from<br>grazed pasture soils</p>
<p>Lincoln University´s commitment to the agricultural industry´s battle to reduce<br>nitrate leaching and the associated problems of water contamination and<br>greenhouse gas emissions has received a Government funding boost of<br>$5.5 million from the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology.</p>
<p>Announced on 18 July, the FoRST contract, one of six awarded to Lincoln<br>University in 2007 to a total value of $16.2 million, supports the<br>internationally recognised soil and environmental research of Professor<br>Keith Cameron and Professor Hong Di.</p>
<p>In the past 10 years the scientists have developed a successful nitrification<br>inhibitor technology that also delivers a production benefit.</p>
<p>Now, with FoRST funding, the two Lincoln University scientists, along with<br>AgResearch, Dexcel and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will be able to<br>improve the scientific understanding of soil biology/chemistry as a platform<br>for increased control over nitrogen cycling in soil.</p>
<p>They are hoping to control the ammonia oxidation rate and reduce nitrate<br>leaching by 50 percent from major dairy pasture soils across New Zealand.</p>
<p>New Zealand´s dairy industry contributes 20 percent of the country´s total<br>export earnings and is targeting a 35 percent increase in milk production by<br>2015. The industry has also targeted a 50 percent reduction in nitrate<br>leaching from its dairy pastures by the same date.</p>

<p>New nitrogen management tools will be delivered to end-users through the<br>research team´s strong connections with the dairy and fertiliser industries<br>and regional councils.</p>
<p>The leaders of the Lincoln University research Professor Cameron and<br>Professor Di describe today´s announcement as exciting because the<br>FoRST funding will enable them to improve fundamental understanding of<br>nitrification processes in soil.</p>
<p>They say that this will help to achieve the environmental goals of the dairy<br>and fertiliser industries.</p>
