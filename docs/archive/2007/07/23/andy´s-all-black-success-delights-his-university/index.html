<p>Andy´s All Black success delights his University</p>
<p>The return of halfback Andy Ellis to the All Blacks - named yesterday (22 July) in the squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup - has delighted Lincoln University´s Sports Scholarship Programme administrators.</p>
<p>Andy came to Lincoln University from Christchurch´s Burnside High School in 2003 as a Rugby Scholar, the same pathway that brought All Black captain Richie McCaw from Otago Boys´ High School to the University in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;We are absolutely thrilled to have two former Sports Scholars, Andy and Richie, in this important All Black squad,&quot; says Lincoln University´s Sports Scholarship Programme Manager Peter Magson.</p>
<p>&quot;We wish them both well as they prepare for France and the World Cup.&quot;</p>
<p>Andy made his All Black debut in November last year against England when New Zealand was on its short end-of-season Northern Hemisphere tour.</p>
<p>Aged 23, he been enrolled in the Landscape Architecture programme at Lincoln University but is currently taking a break from academic study to concentrate on his rugby career. It´s the same with Richie McCaw. Originally enrolled for a Bachelor of Agricultural Science, he too has put his degree on hold to pursue his rugby.</p>
<p>The pair are not the only Lincoln University lads in the All Black squad. Former All Black, Canterbury and Crusaders captain Reuben Thorne, who has been named among the loose forwards, studied resource studies at Lincoln University, and fellow Canterbury, Crusaders and All Black forward Greg Somerville, who has a fitness-dependent position in the World Cup squad being held open until 14 August, has a Farm Management diploma from Lincoln University.</p>
