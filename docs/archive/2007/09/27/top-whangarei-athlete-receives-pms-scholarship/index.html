<p>Top Whangarei athlete receives PM&#39;s Scholarship</p>
<p>Whangarei golfer Gary-John Hill is among the successful North Island based recipients of Prime Minister&#39;s athlete scholarships, Labour MP Shane Jones announced today.</p>
<p>Gary-John is amongst a group of more than 650 nationwide who have been offered a Prime Minister&#39;s Athlete Scholarship this year, allowing them to pursue their studies, as well as reach their sporting goals.</p>
<p>&quot;Sport plays a fundamental role in our national identity, which is why the Labour-led government is committed to supporting our elite athletes, as well as investing in the health and well-being of all New Zealanders,&quot; Shane Jones said.</p>
<p>&quot;Providing athletes with the opportunity to gain a tertiary or vocational qualification while they compete allows them to maintain a healthy balance in their lives, and ensures they have career options after sport.</p>
<p>&quot;With many of these elite athletes going on to represent New Zealand in their chosen sport, it is important that we support them to undertake study so they can concentrate on achieving their sporting goals without the added pressure of having a job.&quot;</p>
<p>Gary-John Hill is studying a Bachelor of Health Science at Massey University.</p>
<p>His current sporting achievements include 10th place at the Auckland Stroke Play Championship and 16th at the New Zealand Under 23 Championships.</p>
<p>Gary-John&#39;s main goal is to win all New Zealand amateur events.</p>
<p>The scholarships are administered by Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC) through the New Zealand Academy of Sport, SPARC&#39;s high performance network.</p>
