<p>CTU MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>11 September 2007</p>
<p>Union organising makes the difference at McDonalds</p>
<p>&quot;Union organising in fast food has made a huge difference in lifting the low wages of thousands of young workers,&quot; CTU secretary Carol Beaumont said today.</p>
<p>Unite and McDonalds have reached agreement to scrap youth rates altogether at McDonalds restaurants from March next year. The move comes days after Parliament passed a Bill ending youth rates for 16 and 17 year olds after the first 200 hours or 3 months, whichever is the lesser.</p>
<p>&quot;This is great news for young workers in fast food, and didn&#39;t come out of the blue. It was the result of a two year campaign of dedicated union activism in fast food industries,&quot; Beaumont said.</p>
<p>&quot;Unite Union&#39;s SuperSizeMyPay campaign lead the charge on youth rates, and thousands of young workers and students got behind this campaign.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Young workers, their unions, school students, community groups and politicians all played a part in getting us to where we are today on the abolition of youth rates, and young workers will see significant pay increases and recognition that the work they are doing is valued and respected.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have no doubt that unions will continue to make improvements for young workers through collective bargaining,&quot; Carol Beaumont said.</p>
