<p>Depression treatment goes online</p>
<p>Depression treatment is moving into cyberspace in a large-scale trial by University of Otago’s Injury Prevention Research Unit.</p>
<p>Lead researcher Dr Shyamala Nada-Raja says the ‘Recovery via Internet from Depression’ (RID) trial is based on an Australian-developed online programme using cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT).</p>
<p>“It focuses on people’s thoughts, feelings and behaviour. It helps them overcome negative thought patterns and turn them around to more positive ways of dealing with life pressures.”</p>
<p>The research group hopes to recruit at least 700 people to take part in the trial by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Dr Nada-Raja says they have made a special effort to have the website for the study (w ww.otago.ac.nz/rid) ready for World Suicide Prevention Day* tomorrow (10 September).</p>
<p>“Anyone who is interested in taking part in the RID trial can access it to find out more before deciding whether or not they want to take part.”</p>
<p>Participants in the study will be divided into three groups. Those who go on to the CBT programme will work, at their own pace, through a four-week online programme of exercises and questions.</p>
<p>They will be compared with a second group who will receive help from an online health coach and a third group who will access online information on depression.</p>
<p>The research group will assess each group’s depression, anxiety, self-harm, alcohol use and quality of life before and after their programme, as well as at six-monthly assessments over the following two years.</p>

<p>The Health Research Council is providing 79 per cent of the funding for the $2m study with the remainder from ACC over nearly four years.</p>
<p>Dr Nada-Raja says the size of the trial is recognition of what a big problem depression is in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The disabling effect of depression, anxiety and panic attacks is underestimated – it’s a leading cause of disability.”</p>
<p>Dr Nada-Raja says about half of those who are depressed don’t come into any contact with health services. “There are several reasons for that I think. It’s part stigma, part access and part not knowing who to see.”</p>
<p>New Zealand is ranked 10th in the world for Internet use, making it well placed to trial the programme, she says.</p>
<p>“Maori and non-Maori have comparable rates of Internet access, plus it provides a way of delivering greater help to people in rural areas.”</p>
<p>Dr Nada-Raja says one of the unusual things about the trial is that it will be run completely online, from delivering the different treatment programmes to carrying out the assessments and follow-ups.  </p>
<p>* World Suicide Prevention Day is an annual event sponsored by the International Association for Suicide Prevention, in collaboration with the World Health Organisation.</p>
