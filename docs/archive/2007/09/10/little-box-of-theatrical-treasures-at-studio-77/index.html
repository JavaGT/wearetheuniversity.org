<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>10 September 2007</p>
<p>Little Box of Theatrical Treasures Opens at Studio 77</p>
<p>This September sees the end of a long journey for three talented theatre students from Victoria University as their directorial debuts come to life in the third season of student-directed plays.</p>
<p>In a season collectively-titled Little Box of Oblivion, each play deals with a vastly different issue, although they are united by a strong surrealist and avant garde notion. This is a clear sign of influence from venerated theatre lecturer Matthew Wagner.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, these three directing students were involved in the Beckett-flavoured production of Twelfth Night, directed by Wagner. Through his sheer passion for non-realist theatrical forms, the students couldn’t help but become fascinated with surrealist, absurdist and avant garde forms too. Brigid Costello says that he “provoked interest in theatrical forms that veered away from the typical realism we were used to and that introduced me to the limitless possibilities of avant garde theatre-something which I have enjoyed exploring throughout my directing process”.</p>
<p>The Zoo Story by Edward Albee, directed by Alexandra Lodge clearly has tendencies towards the absurdist. The play set in New York’s well-known Central Park tells the tale of a man consumed by loneliness who starts up a conversation with a stranger, but things take a darker turn, revealing the dangers of inaction within society.</p>
<p>Christopher Durang’s ‘dentity Crisis directed by Brigid Costello tackles the eternal question of defining identity. Featuring actors that constantly change characters, the play points out the near impossibility of self-identification in our uncertain times.</p>
<p>The season finishes with Harold Pinter’s Party Time directed by Ralph McCubbin Howell. Taking place at an elegant cocktail party, the play has an unsettling undercurrent and we begin to ascertain that the world outside is far from festive. McCubbin Howell was instantly attracted to the minimalist, brooding nature of the play, which was introduced to him by Wagner: “having the support and agreed enthusiasm for the play from Matt Wagner has been especially beneficial”.</p>
<p>These thought-provoking theatrical pieces will unfold at Studio 77, 77 Fairlie Terrace, Kelburn, from Wednesday 19 – Saturday 22 September. Performances start at 7pm with tickets $12 waged and $8 unwaged.</p>
