<p>Minister hides South Auckland teacher crisis</p>
<p>Steve Maharey&#39;s blithe assurances that while teacher numbers are tight there is nothing to worry about, are coming back to haunt him, says National&#39;s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>The Principals Federation says the situation is so bad in South Auckland that some children get a different relieving teacher every day, and the Auckland Primary Principals Association says some schools can&#39;t even find a teacher to fill in.</p>
<p>&quot;I specifically requested, through the Official Information Act, papers on the teacher shortage in regions, including South Auckland, from the Ministry of Education in August - they refused to release the numbers.</p>
<p>&quot;So much for Ministry of Education Chief Executive Karen Sewel&#39;s intentions to run an &#39;open and transparent Ministry&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;This crisis has been brewing for years and Steve Maharey has done nothing but deflect direct questions and offer patronising platitudes.</p>
<p>&quot;The teacher shortage is only going to get worse over the next year, with predictions that an extra 270 teachers will be needed in Auckland to lower the Year 1 teacher/student ratios.</p>
<p>&quot;This situation is already causing alarm about the quality of teaching being offered in some schools, with pupils seeing a continual stream of different teachers or, even worse, no dedicated class teacher at all.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time for Steve Maharey to start telling the truth about the extent of the shortage and take responsibility for the crisis.&quot;</p>
