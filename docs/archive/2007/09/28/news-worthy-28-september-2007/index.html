<p>News Worthy</p>
<p>28 September 2007 - No. 126</p>
<p>Allegations of mendacity</p>
<p>Last week the Speaker ruled that the use of the phrase &quot;tell the truth&quot; was unparliamentary. The consequence is that those who use the phrase will be asked to withdraw the comment and apologise.</p>
<p>Some would say that would akin to being &quot;slapped on the wrist with a wet bus ticket&quot;.</p>
<p>The Standing Orders of Parliament specifically prohibit imputations of improper motives against a member, offensive references to a member&#39;s private affairs and all personal reflections.</p>
<p>It is a clear personal reflection to accuse another member of lying or attempting to deliberately mislead the House. Accusing a member of lying is a mode of expression that has been consistently ruled out of order.</p>
<p>A glance through the amalgamated index of hansard (which records the Parliamentary debates) for 2006 contains multiple references to unparliamentary language including phrases such as &quot;lie like troopers&quot;, &quot;lied to the House&quot;, &quot;lying little turd&quot;, &quot;pathological bully, liar and pervert&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell the truth&quot; has now been added to the list. An allegation of mendacity would still seem permissible.</p>
<p>The grandees of Auckland</p>
<p>So said a speaker in the debate on the recently introduced Auckland Regional Amenities Funding Bill.</p>
<p>The Bill proposes that some eleven entities receive regional funding through a levy imposed on the constituent local authorities - Auckland City, Franklin District, Manukau City, North Shore City, Papakura District, Rodney District and Waitakere City.</p>

<p>There is precedent for that course - the Auckland Museum and MOTAT are funded on a levy basis.</p>
<p>An interesting starting point is that if Auckland were one city like Brisbane (which has a comparable population) the issue would not spark discontent.</p>
<p>A number of questions arise about the Bill. Leave aside whether regional amenities should be funded regionally for reasons of equity. Here are some other questions:</p>
<p>* Who should be on the list of beneficiaries - that proposed list currently includes NZ Opera Ltd and the Auckland Observatory and Planetarium Trust Board. Should Kapa Haka organisations be included?</p>
<p>* Is a levy the best mechanism? Other possibilities range from borrowing by local authorities which generally have strong balance sheets to simply raising funds by rate.</p>
<p>* Should the contributing catchments be necessarily defined by local authority boundaries? The southern part of Franklin for example has a greater affinity with the Waikato than the Auckland region.</p>
<p>The Bill has now been refereed to the Local Government &amp; Environment Select Committee and submissions will be sought.</p>
