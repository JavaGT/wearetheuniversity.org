<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>06 September 2007</p>
<p>Marsden funding for New Zealand&#39;s best and brightest</p>
<p>Alpine faults, colonial literature, sexuality in the media and anti-cancer enzymes are research topics among 18 Victoria projects awarded just under $6m in the prestigious Marsden funding round.</p>
<p>The total awarded to cutting-edge research at Victoria is up from $4.7m last year to $5.97 in this latest round, a boost that Professor Charles Daugherty, Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Research) attributes to the high quality of research across a range of disciplines spanning sciences, the humanities, social sciences and commerce.</p>
<p>&quot;This is one of the most competitive and rigorous rounds of Government funding awarded to projects of the highest calibre,&quot; Professor Daugherty says.</p>
<p>&quot;More than half of our researchers invited to submit a full proposal were successful in the final round.&quot;</p>
<p>He says the University&#39;s up-and-coming researchers did especially well, with nine receiving Marsden Fast-Start grants.</p>
<p>Administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand, the Marsden fund received a $2.25m budget boost from the Government this year, enabling a greater investment in New Zealand’s early career researchers.</p>
