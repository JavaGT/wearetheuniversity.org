<p>Sensible solutions needed for organ transplant problem</p>
<p>National’s Associate Health spokeswoman, Dr Jackie Blue, says the Labour Government should be exploring sensible and practical solutions to address the nationwide organ donor shortage.</p>
<p>She is referring to the case of Wellington woman Angela Murton who urgently needs a kidney transplant but instead, faces red tape, chronic ill-health, dialysis, and months on a waiting list.</p>
<p>Dr Blue, who has a bill in front of Parliament’s Health Select Committee that proposes a national organ donor register to boost the number of organs, says Angela is one of the lucky ones.</p>
<p>“Her husband is willing to donate a kidney but Wellington Hospital only performs one transplant per month from a live donor.</p>
<p>“Angela has been told the hospital has no more capacity and there is no certainty around when she will receive her operation.</p>
<p>“To stabilise her condition, she faces a pre-surgery catheter, two weeks off work, and months of being house-bound, attached to a machine.</p>
<p>“The personal cost to her is incalculable. The financial cost to the hospital will run into tens of thousands of dollars - far more than the cost of a one-off transplant.</p>
<p>“Angela says Wellington Hospital should, while waiting for additional theatres to be built, consider using private hospitals or look at using its own theatres more efficiently.</p>
<p>“The New Zealand Kidney Foundation is calling for a national programme to be established so transplant operations and theatre capacity are co-ordinated nationally.</p>
<p>“These are very sensible solutions. What will it take for this Labour Government to act?</p>
