<p>International report shows more investment needed in tertiary education</p>
<p>New Zealand’s runs the risk of slipping behind other international economies if it does not increase its investment in tertiary education and research and development, according to the Association of University Staff (AUS).</p>
<p>AUS National President. Professor Nigel Haworth, said that data released this week by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) showed that New Zealand continues to rank poorly internationally in its public investment in tertiary education and its private investment in research and development.</p>
<p>The latest edition of the annual OECD report, Education at a Glance, shows that New Zealand consistently ranks around the middle of the thirty OECD countries compared across a variety of measures in what is described as a compendium of international education indicators looking at the quality, quantity, equity and efficiency of education systems.</p>
<p>Professor Haworth said that New Zealand ranked particularly poorly in research and development, with only 1.1 percent of gross domestic product invested, against an OECD average of 2.3 percent. “The report shows, however, that the Government provides 50 percent of the funding for investment in research and development against an OECD average of only 30 percent,” he said. “This must serve a wake-up call for industry if New Zealand is to realize its aspirations for economic transformation and to maintain a position as a strong OECD nation.”</p>

<p>Professor Haworth also said that, although the Government has increased expenditure on tertiary education, it still had further to go. “The report reveals that New Zealand’s expenditure per student on tertiary education, adjusted for purchasing power parity, is $US8,866, against an OECD average of $US11,100. The United States leads the field, investing $US22,476 per full-time student,” he said. “The report also shows that New Zealand is one of a number of countries which has increased participation in tertiary education by relying more on the financial contributions of students and households.”</p>
<p>In terms of student to staff ratios, Professor Haworth said that New Zealand falls well below the pack. “Against an OECD average of 15.8 students to one staff member, New Zealand records 18.2 students per staff member. It is the fifth worst student to staff ratio recorded, although a significant way behind Greece at thirty to one,” he said.</p>
