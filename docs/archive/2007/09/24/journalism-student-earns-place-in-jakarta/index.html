<p>Monday, September 24, 2007<br>Journalism student earns place in Jakarta</p>
<p>Massey journalism student Will Robertson is one of three New Zealanders to have been awarded a work placement in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.</p>
<p>The Australian Consortium of ‘In Country’ Indonesian Studies Journalism Professional Practicum aims to give students the background knowledge and theoretical insights required to work in and report on Indonesia.</p>
<p>ACICIS was established to develop and coordinate study programmes in Indonesia. Its programmes were extended to include media placements in 2002 and for the first time this year New Zealand journalists were invited to join the programme.</p>
<p>Head of Journalism at Massey’s Wellington campus Dr Grant Hannis says he is delighted at Mr Robertson’s success. “He is a capable, hard-working student, and I’m sure he&#39;ll get a lot out of this fantastic opportunity.</p>
<p>“As Asia&#39;s influence on New Zealand grows it is vital that journalists can write about Asia in an informed, intelligent way. It seems to me the best way to gain that knowledge is by the kind of direct experience he is going to have.”</p>
<p>Mr Robertson, who graduates this year, says he has always been interested in Indonesia. “I think it is important we get to know such a huge neighbour. I also see it as an opportunity to get a job in the region. I would like to be a foreign correspondent one day.”</p>
<p>He plans to stay for longer than the six-week practicum, so that he can learn Bahasa (Indonesian language). The practicum starts in January.</p>
<p>Other New Zealand students on the programme are Aroha Treacher and Dylan Quinnell from AUT University.</p>
<p>All three New Zealanders are supported by the Asia:New Zealand Foundation.</p>
