<p>Monday, September 24, 2007<br>Iguaçu tops Hospitality Association Awards</p>
<p>Auckland’s Iguaçu restaurant collected top awards at the New Zealand Hospitality Association Awards, held last week in Wellington.</p>
<p>Co-owner Julie-Ann Bell (Massey MBA, 2005) said she and partner Phil are “pretty chuffed” with the awards.</p>
<p>The competition included both restaurants and hotels. Judging was undertaken by an independent panel who visited premises unannounced on three separate occasions.</p>
<p>Iguaçu won HANZ awards for Best New Zealand Restaurant, Excellence in Customer Service, Best Lamb dish and to top it off, the HANZ 2007 Supreme Overall Winner.</p>
<p>Ms Bell said one of her first moves after buying Iguaçu in 2005 was to create a staff training programme, bringing in expert tutors and preparing a blueprint based on advice from the Hospitality Standards Institute.</p>
<p>“It was all about customer service and communication. That means looking after people from the moment they walk in until they leave the restaurant. It means taking a constructive approach to any complaints: if someone isn’t happy with their food, our staff replace it immediately. It also means understanding that all customers are different in their expectations and needs.”</p>
