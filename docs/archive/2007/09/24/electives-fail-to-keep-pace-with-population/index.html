<p>Tony Ryall MP<br>National Party Health Spokesman</p>
<p>24 September 2007</p>
<p>Electives fail to keep pace with population</p>
<p>National Party Health spokesman Tony Ryall says elective surgery numbers announced by Pete Hodgson today are the latest chapter in his catalogue of failure.</p>
<p>“The fact is the Government is not even keeping up with population growth. There are fewer New Zealanders getting elective surgery on a per capita basis.</p>
<p>“You would have thought doubling the health budget would have delivered much more elective surgery for New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“But to get this result Labour has also culled tens of thousands of patients from waiting lists and watched an emergency department crisis unfold.</p>
<p>“If this result in electives is the best Mr Hodgson can do then it’s time to change the Minister.”</p>
<p>Mr Ryall released figures during the weekend which show only four of the 21 DHBs in New Zealand are meeting all three of the Government&#39;s waiting time benchmarks for treating patients at emergency departments.</p>
<p>“When people are being treated on trolleys in corridors, and when they’re bleeding into garden buckets at accident and emergency, Mr Hodgson has nothing to crow about.</p>
<p>“Despite spending an extra $5 billion a year on health, elective surgery has fallen over 3% on a per capita basis since Labour&#39;s first year running the country.</p>
<p>“Patients deserve much better.”</p>
