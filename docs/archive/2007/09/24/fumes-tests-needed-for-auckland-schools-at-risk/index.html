<p>Toxic fumes tests needed for Auckland schools at risk</p>
<p>Auckland Green Party MP Keith Locke has called for urgent air quality testing of schools in Auckland areas already known to be at risk from high levels of toxic fumes.</p>
<p>&quot;I support mandatory air quality testing for at risk schools, as proposed by the New Zealand Educational Institute,&quot; Mr Locke, the Greens&#39; Spokesperson on Auckland transport issues, says.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps the immediate focus should be on schools in notorious &#39;black spots&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Khyber Pass has long had high levels of toxic fumes, putting at risk the nearby St Peters College, which also borders the southern motorway. Newton Central primary school, in a high fumes gully enclosing the western motorway, is also in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>&quot;This serious problem has to be addressed in a multifaceted way, through</p>
<p>* ameliorating measures to reduce fumes in playgrounds and school buildings.</p>
<p>* not allowing construction of new child care centres or schools beside major roads or motorways.</p>
<p>* taking account of school locations when planning new roads or motorways. The SH 20 extension,currently under construction, unfortunately goes right past the Mt Roskill school complex.</p>
<p>* encouraging the use of low emission vehicles and where possible, re-routing trucks away from schools.</p>
<p>* cutting traffic volumes through concentrating expenditure on better public transport, rather than new highways.</p>
<p>* providing alternatives to the car for transporting students to school, through safe cycle lanes and better bus and train services.</p>
<p>&quot;The money is there, if we take a &#39;whole of government&#39; approach to expenditure. There is a huge cost to the health system in treating respiratory and other illnesses caused by transport fumes - and scientists estimate such illnesses cause over 400 early deaths among Aucklanders,&quot; Mr Locke says.</p>
