<p>Enrolment rules frustrate special schools</p>
<p>Barring special schools from entering their own school enrolment information discriminates against them and leads to frustrating delays and entry errors, says National&#39;s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>All schools, except special schools, are allowed to enter students&#39; details in the new online enrolment data system ENROL, which is being rolled out around the country.</p>
<p>&quot;If the slight wasn&#39;t annoying enough, the first special schools knew that they didn&#39;t have the same access was during training for the system.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry&#39;s reasons for withholding access don&#39;t stack up and no one in the sector agrees.</p>
<p>&quot;Requiring schools to send all their information to Wellington to be entered on computer has already caused frustrating delays and entry errors.</p>
<p>&quot;I can understand why schools get annoyed to find that names have been misspelled, entered twice, or worse, not at all. The Ministry typist just doesn&#39;t know the students as well as the school.</p>
<p>&quot;Special schools should have the same right as any other school to enter and control their own information.</p>
<p>The Ministry should stop citing Section 9 and just unlock the schools&#39; access to allow them to enter the data for their own students.&quot;</p>
