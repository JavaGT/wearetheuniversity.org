<p>Online money lending takes top prize at Entrepreneurship Challenge</p>
<p>An online marketplace that sidesteps the banks, allowing people to lend and borrow directly with each other, claimed the top prize at the Spark $40K Challenge at The University of Auckland Business School last night (Thursday, September 20).</p>
<p>‘Nexx’ went home with $20,000 in seed funding and a nine month tenancy at The ICEHOUSE business incubator, valued at $10,000.</p>
<p>The Spark Entrepreneurship Challenge arms University staff and students with the tools to turn promising research and business ideas into commercial ventures. More than $60,000 in cash and prizes was handed out last night.</p>
<p>Nexx applies the social networking concept of websites like MySpace and YouTube to the world of finance. Borrowers list their financial projects online (<a href="http://www.nexx.co.nz">www.nexx.co.nz</a>), and lenders pledge funds and interest rates via an auction, cutting banks and finance companies out of transactions.</p>
<p>Nexx team members Ben Milsom, Glenn Riddell, James Wallace and Mark Catley are all University of Auckland students.</p>
<p>A record 80 entries were submitted to the $40K Challenge this year. The top twelve qualifiers received intensive mentoring and training to develop their idea before the winner was selected.</p>
<p>Spark $40k runner-up ‘Nerian’ received $10,000 in start-up capital. Nerian is a venture by researchers from the School of Biological Sciences which isolates the healthy antioxidants in red wine and puts them in a range of value-adding products.</p>

<p>The Spark Aspire Challenge winner ‘Dynamic Water Solutions’ received $5000 for an idea to achieve environmental or social change. This team has designed a device to detect the presence of Didymo, an invasive freshwater alga threatening New Zealand waterways.</p>
<p>Spark Chief Executive Darsel Keane says the competition draws out the creative ideas brewing beneath the surface at the University.</p>
<p>“Many of the previous Spark winners have gone on to be great commercial successes. We firmly believe that encouraging brilliant people to think with an entrepreneurial mindset has a flow-on effect into the business community and the New Zealand economy,” Miss Keane says.</p>
<p>Spark is a student-led initiative run in conjunction with The University of Auckland Business School and The ICEHOUSE business incubator. Its major sponsors are ASB Bank, No.8 Ventures, NZTE and UniServices.</p>
