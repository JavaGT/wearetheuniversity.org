<p>Otago secures major Marsden funding</p>
<p>University of Otago researchers have gained major funding to undertake leading-edge research in the latest Marsden round announced today.</p>
<p>More than a quarter of this year’s $44m pool was allocated to Otago researchers to undertake 20 projects. The University’s share was the largest of any institution.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University will investigate areas ranging from the origin of our solar system, to a potential HIV therapy, to the history of interracial marriage in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Other projects include improving eyewitnesses’ identification of suspects in photo line-ups and the role a hormone called MIS may play in boys’ behaviour.</p>
<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) Professor Geoff White congratulated the Otago researchers on their well-earned success in the prestigious funding round.</p>
<p>“Marsden funding is extremely competitive nationally - only 10 per cent of the initial applications were eventually funded this year. For Otago’s applications, the success rate was 12.5 per cent.</p>
<p>“Our researchers’ outstanding performance reflects the excellence of the proposals they put forward. Their success rate is an important quality measure that reinforces Otago’s status as New Zealand’s top-ranked university for research,” says Professor White.</p>
<p>The researchers, from across the University’s Divisions of Health Sciences, Humanities, and Sciences, gained 17 contracts and three Fast-Start grants in the round.</p>

<p>The three Fast-Starts provide important support for promising projects by emerging researchers at Otago and are very welcome, says Professor White.</p>
