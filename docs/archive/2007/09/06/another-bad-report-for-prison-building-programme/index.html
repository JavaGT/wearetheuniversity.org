<p>Another bad report for prison building programme</p>
<p>Simon Power MP<br>National Party Justice &amp; Corrections Spokesman</p>
<p>5 September 2007</p>
<p>Yet another report has found that Corrections has badly handled taxpayers’ money in the building of prisons, says National’s Justice &amp; Corrections spokesman, Simon Power.</p>
<p>“The Treasury-commissioned report into the building of Spring Hill and Otago prisons shows these projects were badly planned, that savings could have been made had they not pre-purchased materials that locked them into designs they could not change, and that they contained unnecessary luxuries.</p>
<p>“This backs up everything I have been saying about the regional prisons development project – that it was an extravagant use of taxpayers’ money.</p>
<p>“Corrections used a contracting method that demanded the pre-purchasing of materials that locked them into designs that were more costly than they needed to be.”</p>
<p>The report says <em>‘most of the significant materials … had been pre-purchased’</em> and this <em>‘committed not only capital, but also to the design and construction strategies – the cost of changing these strategies at this stage would be prohibitively high, despite the potential opportunity for better value-for-money.’</em>  </p>
<p>“For two years, Corrections has argued that part of the reason for the building project’s budget blowout of $490 million was because of rising prices for materials such as steel.</p>
<p>“This doesn’t seem to tally with the report’s finding that these materials were pre-purchased to guard against exactly that.</p>
<p>“The report also says the two prisons exceeded the design standards of Australian prisons – that they were built with toilets in every cell, rather than communal facilities.</p>
<p>“It estimates that savings of not having these personal facilities would have been in the region of $11.5 million. That’s staggering.</p>
<p>“It also says cultural and religious facilities were of a higher standard than in equivalent Australian prisons, as were dining and recreational areas, and that even at the end of construction they could have saved $600,000 on landscaping</p>
<p>“Damien O&#39;Connor said these prisons were <em>‘not gold-plated’.</em> This report shows he was wrong.”</p>
