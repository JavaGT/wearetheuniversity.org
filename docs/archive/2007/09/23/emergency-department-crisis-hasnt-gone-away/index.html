<p>Tony Ryall MP<br>National Party Health Spokesman</p>
<p>23 September 2007</p>
<p>Emergency Department crisis hasn&#39;t gone away</p>
<p>&quot;Patients will continue to languish on trolleys in hospital corridors, because New Zealand&#39;s major hospital emergency departments are still failing to see emergency patients soon enough,&quot; says National Party Health spokesman Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>The latest information for the three months ending June 2007, shows that only four of the 21 DHBs in New Zealand is meeting all three of the Government&#39;s waiting time benchmarks for treating patients at emergency departments. These benchmarks are recommended by the Australasian College of Emergency Medicine.</p>
<p>&quot;Only the Tairawhiti, Wairarapa, Nelson Marlborough and South Canterbury DHBs met all three benchmarks for emergency treatment times.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the major DHBs are, in fact, going backwards.</p>
<p>&quot;Many hospitals struggle to even see patients with immediate or imminent threat to &#39;life or limb&#39; (*1). Despite the huge amount of extra money being poured into the health system, it obviously isn&#39;t getting to where it&#39;s needed.</p>
<p>&quot;Emergency Departments are barometers about how well the rest of the hospital is doing. How long you wait in a hospital emergency department has a direct bearing on how well any treatment will work (*2). Sadly, everyone knows someone who has waited hours and hours to be seen at an ED. Yet the Government waits for more reports and keeps giving excuses.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ryall says the data he is releasing today does not include less serious patients whose waiting time in emergency departments is not reported (*3). Subsequent to the release of this latest information, the Ministry of Health has advised that data errors may be behind a number of DHBs failing to meet the most urgent Triage 1 targets.</p>

<p>&quot;Health Minister Pete Hodgson could fix delays in emergency care by improving after-hours GP care and using innovative approaches like putting GP clinics in some emergency departments. &quot;Too much energy, money and time is being spent on Labour covering its tracks, and not enough is finding its way to the frontline,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>Footnotes:</p>
<p>*1 - Triage 2</p>
<p>*2 - Ministry of Health, Health and Independence Report 2006.</p>
<p>*3 - Triage 1: Immediate: these patients tend to have an immediate threat to life and limb, such as immediate risk to airway breathing or circulation or are deeply unconscious.</p>
<p>Triage 2: 10 minutes: These patients tend to have potential or imminent threat to life or limb. For example serious head injury, moderately severe trauma, suspected heart attack. Traige 3: 30 minutes: these patients tend to have conditions which need urgent management or are associated with significant systems. For example fractures, breathlessness, bleeding.</p>
