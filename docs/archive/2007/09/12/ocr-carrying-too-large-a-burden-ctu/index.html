<p>OCR carrying too large a burden - CTU</p>
<p>The Official Cash Rate should not have to be the main tool to address runaway house price inflation, the Council of Trade Unions told a select committee enquiry today.</p>
<p>The CTU made a number of suggestions about the operation of monetary policy including more explicit reference to the needs of the export sector and for the OCR decision to be made by a small number of people as is the case overseas rather than the Governor alone.</p>
<p>CTU Economist Peter Conway said that “the main focus of the CTU submission was on additional measures to address house price inflation. This included a more rigorous capital gains tax on investment properties, increasing housing supply and removing the ability to offset losses on investment properties against other income”.</p>
<p>“We also said how a continuing focus on improving productivity can take pressure off inflation. But the benefits of improved productivity must be shared with workers.”</p>
<p>“One of the drivers of house price inflation has been the extent to which people are encouraged to take on a high level of debt. We propose greater controls on bank lending practices, and bank’s pay systems and disciplinary processes that incentivise staff to maximise customer lending need to be addressed.”</p>
<p>“We recognise that any solution will have a downside.”</p>
<p>“But this should be considered alongside the damage being done now – thousands more New Zealanders every year being priced out of decent housing, manufacturers laying off workers due to the twin effect of interest and exchange rates, and a long run cycle where the currency appears to settle even at the bottom of the cycle at a higher level each time,” Peter Conway said.</p>
