<p>Strengthening the thin blue line<br>National standards: passing the test<br>How to grow strong communities</p>
<p>IN THE NEWS</p>
<p>More couples staying married<br>New Zealand “miserly” on aid</p>
<p>STRENGTHENING THE THIN BLUE LINE</p>
<p>The report of the three year Commission of Inquiry into Police Conduct<br>released to Parliament this week has raised major questions about what we<br>expect of our Police and about how well those expectations are being<br>communicated.</p>
<p>The Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Police Conduct examines police<br>practices, conduct and internal investigations between 1979 and 2005, and<br>makes 60 recommendations for the New Zealand Police. Overall, the<br>Commission praised the New Zealand Police for good practices, commending<br>the vast majority of hard-working Kiwi cops. It also recognised, however,<br>that a higher moral standard is expected of those holding positions of<br>authority in our community, and so saw an overwhelming need for the<br>creation of standards and policies regarding the conduct of officers,<br>particularly their sexual conduct.</p>
<p>Dame Margaret Bazley, who headed the Inquiry, said that although there was<br>evidence of some &#39;disgraceful conduct&#39; during the period investigated, many<br>of these incidents took place during the 1980s, and since then initiatives<br>have been taken by Police management to address these areas. Despite this,<br>the Commission recommends the creation of a single, accessible code of<br>conduct for officers, especially in relation to appropriate sexual<br>practices. It is disappointing that such a document is needed to ensure<br>that Police officers are aware of what the community considers appropriate<br>sexual conduct. Whether officers choose to do right and adhere to the code<br>will impact on the public&#39;s level of confidence in the Police and trust in<br>their authority.</p>

<p>The report indicates an expectation within our community that, as holders<br>of power and authority, the Police are held to a higher standard of moral<br>conduct, whether on duty or off. There is no one document, however, that<br>the Police can refer to for guidance in this area. In many ways, it is a<br>sign of our post-modern society that such a document is needed; in a<br>culture where personal morals are seen as fluid and subjective, such a<br>solid and directive code of conduct imposes from outside what has failed to<br>be formed internally: allegiance to the common moral ethic, and a culture<br>of self-control.</p>

<p>NATIONAL STANDARDS: PASSING THE TEST</p>
<p>John Key turned up the heat on education standards this week, issuing a<br>challenge to Prime Minister Helen Clark to say how many kids left primary<br>school last year without reaching the minimum expected standard in reading,<br>writing and maths, and calling for national standards in literacy and<br>numeracy.</p>
<p>This challenge was hot on the heels of a report from the Education Review<br>Office (ERO) on the collection and use of assessment information in<br>schools, which found only 44 percent of schools were &#39;effectively<br>establishing and using school-wide information to improve student<br>achievement.&#39; The statements highlight the absence of a national report on<br>pupil progress in New Zealand. Every pupil in every school should be<br>assessed against national standards to monitor their progress and to<br>understand the value added by the teacher or the school to their learning.<br>There is some information available, but the education system could do a<br>lot better.</p>
<p>The government and the Ministry of Education have deliberately shunned the<br>introduction of national standards - and assessments referenced to them -<br>out of an irrational fear that the information will lead to parents<br>comparing schools. While teachers need assessments that help them to find<br>out what pupils can and cannot do, there is also a need for assessments<br>that can monitor precisely how pupils are progressing towards expected<br>standards—like learning to read.</p>
<p>One of the various national tests which schools may use in the classroom,<br>asTTle (Assessment Tools for Teaching and Learning), touched on by Mr Key,<br>has the potential to be developed into a national report on pupil progress.<br>Since asTTle tests are calibrated to both national norms for sub-groups of<br>the population and achievement standards within curriculum levels, pupils&#39;<br>results can be compared against a common understanding of achievement, and<br>teachers alerted if there is cause for concern. This sort of monitoring is<br>what parents expect, and they should have it.</p>
<p>The problem is that asTTle remains voluntary because of the educrats&#39; fear<br>of comparison. Mr Key has missed the opportunity to require every school to<br>employ asTTle. Using asTTle would mean teachers would have a national<br>&#39;test&#39; that could help them in the classroom and provide a comprehensive<br>national report on pupil progress, without having to introduce an elaborate<br>national exam to test whether pupils have achieved national standards.<br>Pupils, parents and teachers would all benefit.</p>

<p>HOW TO GROW STRONG COMMUNITIES</p>
<p>At the Maxim Institute 2007 Forum last Friday, Professor Peter Saunders,<br>from the Centre for Independent Studies in Australia, gave an address on<br>The power of community and the limits of government. His talk really cut to<br>the heart of the central challenge posed by social justice - how do we<br>build strong communities? The key ideas of his talk are summarised below.</p>
<p>Sociologist Ferdinand Toennies, said, &#39;The sentiments and motives which<br>draw people to each other, keep them together, and induce them to joint<br>action&#39;. People tend to be drawn together through family relations, shared<br>geographic location, shared beliefs, or conversely, through self-interest<br>in matters such as trade. Clearly these factors are all important things<br>which strengthen communities. In pursuing social justice we have too often<br>turned to the government, expecting it to create social cohesion by<br>redistributing wealth when, in fact, increased interference by government<br>can have unintended consequences - even producing a weaker and more<br>disconnected society.</p>
<p>When we look to government to be chiefly responsible for bringing about<br>social justice, we disempower individuals by removing the need for personal<br>responsibility. We instead entrench dependency. We politicise civil society<br>when government removes the need for communities to help people;<br>consequently, civil society ends up simply lobbying the government for<br>money, rather than tackling the problem itself. In doing this we also crowd<br>out the &#39;little platoons&#39;, the organic institutions and allegiances of the<br>community which are capable of meeting needs.</p>
<p>Government is not a neutral force; when it acts, it either acts for good or<br>for evil and sometimes the consequences of legislation will not be seen for<br>a long time. There is some evidence to suggest that in New Zealand,<br>increased government spending and initiatives have not built the social<br>cohesion they aimed at.</p>
<p>Sociologist Robert Nisbet&#39;s insight and response to Toennies is instructive<br>for all seeking social justice: People will not come together in small,<br>cohesive social groups unless they share some practical reason for doing<br>so, when they recognise some common purpose that must be realised through<br>cooperating with each other. The more the State does for people, the less<br>they need to do for themselves and the fewer reasons there will be for them<br>to associate together, and to work together, for the common good.</p>

<p>MORE COUPLES STAYING MARRIED</p>
<p>More couples in New Zealand are remaining married, an incline which has<br>been linked to the current strong economy. New data has been released this<br>week by the Ministry of Social Development at the Social Policy Research<br>and Evaluation Conference 2007. These new figures show there has been a<br>slight increase in married couples staying together; 72 percent of couples<br>remained together as shown in the 2006 census, up one percent from 2001.</p>
<p>The data shows that the largest increase in couples staying together is<br>found in those couples with children under the age of three. Moira Wilson,<br>analyst from the Ministry of Social Development, said that the data points<br>to the likelihood of a higher success rate in marriages for this younger<br>generation than the previous generation, which suffered through a tougher<br>financial period. Given the importance of marriage for children and society<br>at large, such figures are an encouraging sign.</p>

<p>NEW ZEALAND &#39;MISERLY&#39; ON AID</p>
<p>A new OECD report shows that New Zealand&#39;s level of overseas development<br>aid remains at 0.27 percent of the Gross National Income (GNI), unchanged<br>from 2005. This level of foreign aid ranks New Zealand in the bottom six<br>OECD countries for aid levels, along with Japan, Portugal, Italy, the<br>United States and Greece. OXFAM New Zealand labelled the figure &#39;miserly&#39;,<br>and United Future Leader Peter Dunne called for New Zealand to increase the<br>amount to 0.7 percent &#39;over the next few years&#39;.</p>
