<p>Somalia-born Mohamud Mohamed has overcome a lack of schooling and English language to complete a Bachelor of Social Work at Massey’s Wellington campus.</p>
<p>The Port Nicholson Rotary Club acknowledged his achievements this week with a Rotary Goal Setter Award.</p>
<p>Rotary member Alastair McDonald says the Awards recognise young Wellingtonians who have shown outstanding achievement and leadership. “Mr Mohamed has overcome significant barriers to accomplish his goals.”</p>
<p>After being forced to leave school at the age of 10, Mr Mohamed spent nine years in Kenya before resettling in New Zealand in 1999.</p>
<p>One of the coordinators of the Social Work degree, Dr Carole Adamson, says that Mohamud&#39;s achievement exemplifies his positive attitude to life. “We congratulate him and admire his determination, humility and willingness to explore cross-cultural and professional issues. We are really proud of his success.”</p>
<p>Mr Mohamed says he has a passion for education and intends to complete a master’s degree.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen people face many difficulties and want to make a positive difference. I chose a social work career because I want to help people.”</p>
<p>Mr Mohamed is employed by Barnardos as a community development co-ordinator in Lower Hutt and at the National office. He also works as an interpreter, helping people with health and immigration matters. He lives in Karori with his wife and two daughters.</p>
<p>He will graduate at the University’s Wellington graduation ceremony at the Michael Fowler Centre on 29 May.</p>
