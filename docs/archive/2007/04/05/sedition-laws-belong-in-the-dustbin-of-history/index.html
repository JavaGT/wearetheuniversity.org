<p>Sedition laws belong in the dustbin of history</p>
<p>Green Party Human Rights Spokesperson MP Keith Locke today supported the call by Law Commission president Sir Geoffrey Palmer to scrap New Zealand laws on sedition.</p>
<p>&quot;Sedition laws can no longer be justified in a free society. They are a throwback to the dark old days when sedition was used by governments to suppress political dissent. Three former leaders of the Labour Party - Harry Holland, Peter Fraser, and Walter Nash were all charged with sedition. So were Maori leaders such as Te Whiti and Rua Kenana,&quot; Mr Locke says.</p>
<p>&quot;Now more than ever, we need to protect the right to political dissent. Since 9/11, terrorism has become a rationale for government action that infringes the civil liberties of ordinary citizens. The rights of free political speech are a cornerstone of democratic society.</p>
<p>&quot;As the Law Commission report says, the legal profile of the sedition offence is &#39;broad, variable and uncertain.&#39; It &#39;invades the democratic value of free speech for no adequate reason&#39; and falls foul of the Bill of Rights. Moreover, the report concludes, other offences now more appropriately address what was formerly seen as falling within the ambit of sedition.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been disturbing that the New Zealand Police have invoked the sedition laws as a catchall. The Tim Selwyn case for instance, is a good illustration of Sir Geoffrey&#39;s point that other laws are available - such as intentional damage, or directly inciting criminal activity.</p>

<p>&quot;Absurdly, the sedition laws were used this year to prosecute a student bar owner in Dunedin, for publicising an orientation week stunt competition with a petrol-soaked couch as a prize.</p>
<p>&quot;The response to the Law Commission report should be swift and certain. The Government needs to have the courage to scrap the sedition laws as soon as possible. A good starting point would be the draft bill included as appendix two of the Law Commission report.</p>
<p>&quot;The sedition laws belong in the dustbin of history. Scrapping them would be a useful reminder that we still need to defend the right to political dissent,&quot; Mr Locke says.</p>
