<p>Katherine Rich MP<br>National Party Education Spokeswoman</p>
<p>5 April 2007</p>
<p>No room for complacency in education</p>
<p>National Party Education spokeswoman Katherine Rich is urging principals to take some time over the long weekend and actually read John Key&#39;s speech about lifting standards in primary school education.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m startled by the number of principals who are reacting to hearsay and misinformation being spread by National&#39;s political opponents. I challenge those critics to actually read the speech and engage in an informed debate.&quot;</p>
<p>The National Party has already rejected claims that its policies are a precursor to a new mass testing regime, or would lead to the publication of league tables.</p>
<p>&quot;These have been the main criticisms. But the claims are unfounded, and in some cases just misleading.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Rich says National plans to let schools choose from a range of existing assessment tools, but then to use that information to develop national standards.</p>
<p>&quot;All the parents I speak to are crying out for better information about how their child is doing at school. We need to confront and address failure earlier. Secondary schools shouldn&#39;t be left to pick up the pieces.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Rich says the recent Education Review Office report reveals that too many schools are not effectively using the data they&#39;re collecting. National also refuses to be complacent about figures that show one in five students is not succeeding at school.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve been following some of the comments in recent days. Alarmingly, one report today says &#39;principals were happy with the present primary education system and saw no need to change it&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;I worry for our kids when those who educate them believe that failing one in five students is acceptable.</p>
<p>&quot;John Key has set his sights higher than that. Our children deserve no less.&quot;</p>
