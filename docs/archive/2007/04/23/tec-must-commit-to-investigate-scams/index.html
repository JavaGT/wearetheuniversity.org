<p>Pansy Wong MP<br>National Party Associate Education Spokeswoman</p>
<p>23 April 2007</p>
<p>TEC must commit to investigate scams</p>
<p>National Party Associate Education spokeswoman Pansy Wong says the Tertiary Education Commission must honour its commitment to reinitiate inquiries into alleged scams being run by private education providers.</p>
<p>&quot;I have provided the Tertiary Education Commission with documents that appear to throw doubt on the paperwork provided by one tertiary education provider to an official TEC inquiry last year.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Wong says the TEC and the Government relied on that information to say funding rorts in the sector were not widespread.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet the statements of two students that I have provided to the TEC, allege they received incentives after declarations were signed saying no such payments were being made, or had been made.</p>
<p>&quot;If the students&#39; allegations are correct, this may constitute a bid to mislead an official Government inquiry. That is something that TEC will want to chase up I am sure.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Wong says when the allegations first surfaced last week, TEC chief executive Janice Shiner said &#39;we will follow that up&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;I plan to hold them to their word on that. They said they wanted to talk to students and I am happy to help make that happen if I can.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Wong wrote to the Commission on Friday asking them to re-open their probe into 13 institutions last year. (Letter attached)</p>
<p>&quot;If institutions did not reveal the whole story in those declarations, what faith can we have in the rest of the TEC inquiry?</p>
<p>&quot;Do we really know how much taxpayer money was caught up in this?&quot;</p>
