<p>Media Release<br>From NZEI Te Riu Roa<br>Monday April 23, 2007<br>For Immediate Use</p>
<p>NZEI Acknowledges Need for Graduating Teacher Standards</p>
<p>The New Zealand Educational Institute supports the introduction of national standards for graduating teachers.</p>
<p>The new Graduating Teacher Standards were released today by The New Zealand Teachers Council. They outline the knowledge, skills,values and ethics that student teachers will have to have before they qualify as teachers from January next year.</p>
<p>&quot;NZEI supports the introduction of these new standards because successful student learning requires quality teachers,&quot; says Irene Cooper, the National President of NZEI Te Riu Roa, the union representing primary teachers and principals, early childhood teachers and students studying to become primary and early childhood teachers.</p>
<p>&quot;Our student teachers have been expressing their concern about inconsistencies in the quality of their study programmes for some time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They will welcome the requirement that teacher education providers will have to ensure that their programmes meet the new standards,&quot; says Irene Cooper.</p>
<p>She says that primary principals have also spoken of wide variations in the quality of newly qualified teachers.</p>
<p>&quot;They too will welcome these new standards as they will hopefully mean that there is a greater consistency in the quality of the teacher graduates applying for jobs in schools and early childhood education centres,&quot; says Irene Cooper.</p>
<p>She says we must recognise that teacher education does not end when a student teacher qualifies and enters the profession.</p>

<p>&quot;We must expect a good standard of newly qualified teachers but we must also recognise that they are just starting their careers,&quot; says Irene Cooper.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s essential that they have good advice and guidance during their first two years in the classroom as they work towards becoming fully registered teachers.&quot;</p>
<p>Irene Cooper says teaching is a demanding and challenging profession and teachers are constantly having to update their knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to ensure that we provide the time and resources needed so that teachers have access to professional development throughout their career.&quot;</p>
