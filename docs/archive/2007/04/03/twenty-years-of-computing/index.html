<p>Twenty Years Of Computing</p>
<p>Academics from around New Zealand have today gathered in Auckland to mark AUT Professor Philip Sallis&#39; 20-year contribution to the disciplines of Computing and Information Sciences.</p>
<p>Professor Mark Apperley, Dean of the Faculty of Computing and Mathematics at Waikato University, says 20 years as a professor within computing disciplines means Professor Sallis has joined a very select group in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;He has made a significant contribution towards encouraging the computing disciplines, both as an educator and through influential roles he has held. I remember his time as President of the New Zealand Computer Society as a very productive time for the society,&quot; says Professor Apperley.</p>
<p>Professor Sallis, who became the University of Otago&#39;s youngest professor when he was appointed Foundation Chair for the Department of Information Science at age 36, is currently the Deputy Vice-Chancellor of AUT University, a position he has held since 2003.</p>
<p>&quot;When I was first appointed a professor twenty years ago, I wondered what holding the title would actually mean. It has been about sharing in the leadership of the universities I have worked for and facilitating other people to develop in their roles.&quot;</p>
<p>Throughout his academic career, Professor Sallis has gained a reputation for leadership in curriculum design and innovative programme delivery for Computer and Information Sciences.</p>
<p>&quot;Mature as these disciplines might appear today, my career began at a time when Computer Science degrees were only just emerging and were predominantly outgrowths from mathematics except for a few data-processing oriented courses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Change has been a constant in my field and I have thrived on that challenge. My career since 1972 has spanned a lot of the development of computational sciences. In education and research I have worked across scientific computing, computing in humanities and I have also had significant involvement with industry-based activity.&quot;</p>
<p>As Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor Sallis developed AUT&#39;s research infrastructure in preparation for its university accreditation and was instrumental in establishing the business incubator AUT Technology Park.</p>
<p>Professor Sallis says his decision to come to AUT in 1999 was driven the challenge of securing University classification and his belief the organisation had a significant contribution to make to New Zealand&#39;s tertiary landscape.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven&#39;t been disappointed.&quot;</p>
<p>Before coming to AUT, Professor Sallis held the Foundation Chair for the University of Otago&#39;s Department of Information Science for 13 years. He is credited with building the department&#39;s research income to a point where it was greater than any other single department other than Medicine.</p>
<p>&quot;He really put Information Sciences on the map at the University of Otago and has had a strong influence on computing education in a much wider setting,&quot; says Professor Apperley.</p>
<p>Professor Sallis&#39; career in teaching and education has also spanned positions with London&#39;s Metropolitan University and The City University, and Sydney&#39;s University of Technology.</p>
<p>He has also held visiting research positions in the UK, Hong Kong and the USA, still holding a visiting research professorship at the University of California Santa Barbara, where he continues his research in digital imaging, simulation and system performance measurement. </p>
