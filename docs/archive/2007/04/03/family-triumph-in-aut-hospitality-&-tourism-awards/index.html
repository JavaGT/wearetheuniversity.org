<p>Family triumph in AUT hospitality &amp; tourism awards</p>
<p>By AUT journalism student Justin Kary</p>
<p>Like father like daughter; or should that be like daughter like father?</p>
<p>Food is a family affair for AUT hospitality students Jean and Danny Wan. Father and daughter are joint winners of the prestigious City &amp; Guilds International Diploma in Culinary Arts Trophy for AUT’s Most Outstanding Student for 2006.</p>
<p>They won the award for their success in the City &amp; Guilds exam which is an option for some AUT cookery students. London-based City &amp; Guilds is an internationally recognised provider of trade qualifications.</p>
<p>The Wans were among several award winners recognised at AUT School of Hospitality and Tourism&#39;s annual prize giving in March (full list below).</p>
<p>Danny also won AUT’s Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Certificate in Advanced Professional Cookery for 2006.</p>
<p>“It was a pleasant surprise to discover that we were both top of the class in culinary arts,” says Danny. Jean agrees the honour was “unexpected”.</p>
<p>Exam preparation was part of their training at the school. “The facilities are first class, and the lecturers are very experienced and supportive,” says Danny.</p>
<p>Originally from Malaysia, the family migrated to New Zealand about four years ago and live in Howick.</p>
<p>Jean, 21, has just completed a two-year Diploma in Culinary Arts and has now started the Diploma in Patisserie to enhance her skills. “It’s called being a glutton for punishment,” she says.</p>
<p>As well as studying at AUT, she works as a commis chef at the SkyCity restaurant Rebo. When she finishes her studies she plans to work as a chef and travel the world.</p>
<p>Danny has completed three AUT cookery certificates. Before that, he was in the property business for 20 years to “put bread on the table.”</p>
<p>He also owned a Vietnamese restaurant in Malaysia but his ultimate goal now is to teach cooking * “ideally at AUT”.</p>
<p>Like his daughter, Danny is working at SkyCity * as a demi chef in the rotating restaurant Orbit. He also plans to enrol for the Diploma in Patisserie at AUT.</p>
<p>AUT’s Programme Leader for Culinary Arts Glenys Casci says the duo have been great students.</p>
