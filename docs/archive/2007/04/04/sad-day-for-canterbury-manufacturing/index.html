<p>4 April 2007</p>
<p>Sad day for Canterbury manufacturing</p>
<p>Today&#39;s announcement of 140 job losses in Christchurch is a bitter blow for the workers concerned and for the Canterbury regional economy according to Green Party Economic Development Spokesperson Sue Bradford.</p>
<p>Ms Bradford was responding to the announcement from GL Bowron tannery and plastic manufacturer Click Clack that each was laying off 70 staff.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason given for the lay-offs in both cases is the effect of the high New Zealand dollar,&quot; Ms Bradford says.</p>
<p>&quot;The high dollar and high interest rates are the twin evils facing the producers of this country today. The Government and the Reserve Bank urgently need to re-evaluate their macro-economic policies to help the sustainability of the national and local economies.</p>
<p>&quot;The Green Party is trying to do what it can to keep manufacturing jobs in this country through its leadership of the Green/Government Buy Kiwi Made programme. But the success of this campaign will be diminished by a hostile economic environment.</p>
<p>&quot;I will be in Christchurch next week opening the Regional NZ Made Showcase. I will be talking to local manufacturers about the challenges they are currently facing,&quot; Ms Bradford says</p>
<p>The Christchurch public will have an opportunity on Friday April 13th to view the breadth and depth of Canterbury and other New Zealand manufacturing at the NZ Made Showcase. The showcase will be held at the Christchurch Convention Centre from 10.00 am to 4.00 pm.</p>
