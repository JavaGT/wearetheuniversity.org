<p>Taxpayer ad campaign for ECE misses target</p>
<p>National Party Education spokeswoman Katherine Rich is questioning whether taxpayers received value for money from a poorly targeted TV ad campaign for the Government&#39;s fraudulent 20 hours free policy.</p>
<p>&quot;When academic research confirms that mums are key to the decision about children&#39;s participation in early childhood education, why has the 20 hours free commercial been shown during hardcore wrestling shows like Smackdown, Raw, and Extreme Championship Wrestling - shows watched largely by young men?&quot; Mrs Rich asked in Parliament today.</p>
<p>Answers to written parliamentary questions show the TV campaign, worth more than $260,000, secured advertising spots in the most unlikely of places.</p>
<p>&quot;I would argue that placing taxpayer-funded ads for early childhood education during shows like Smackdown, Raw and ECW is unlikely to be a very effective vehicle to promote any kind of early childhood education message.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has been pretty blatant about the purpose of this campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the looming failure on the key promise of 20 hours free early childhood education for all 3 and 4-year-olds, Steve Maharey&#39;s hoping parents will pressure ECE centres into accepting the Government&#39;s second rate policy.</p>
<p>&quot;In a bid to sway opinion, Labour is spending hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars advertising a policy that does not yet exist, and a policy which early childhood centres are rejecting in droves. It&#39;s even more wasteful when the communications are so ill-targeted.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#39;s the point of paying for cheap slots during wrestling, car shows and golf when many of the viewers will not be remotely interested in an early childhood education message?&quot;</p>
