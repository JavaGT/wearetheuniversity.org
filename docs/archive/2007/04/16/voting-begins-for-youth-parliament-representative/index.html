<p><strong>Monday, 16 April 2007, 2:37 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>16 April 2007</p>
<p>Voting begins for Youth Parliament representative</p>
<p>Christchurch Central MP Tim Barnett is using online elections to select his Youth MP and is encouraging young people in his electorate to vote by visiting <a href="http://www.youthparliament.govt.nz">www.youthparliament.govt.nz</a> online. To date 242 votes have been received since the poll opened on 2 April. Voting closes on 24 April.</p>
<p>Youth selected by their local MPs will go to Wellington to represent the views of their peers in New Zealand&#39;s fifth Youth Parliament to be held from Sunday 8 to Wednesday 11 July.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an exciting chance for young people to understand and participate in what really goes on in government. It is a unique opportunity for a representative of youth to express their views and opinions. They will have direct access to politicians, the government structure and the public&quot;, Tim Barnett said.</p>
<p>The Youth MPs will have the opportunity to debate a mock Bill, raise issues of importance to them in a general debate, sit on Select Committees and ask parliamentary questions of Cabinet Ministers. Topics of debate in previous years include: tax, abortion, student loans, NCEA, sign language, terrorism, youth councils, factory farming, defence, child abuse, technology and transport.</p>
<p>Youth Parliament has been held every three years since 1994.</p>
