<p>Colin King MP<br>National Party Associate Education Spokesman</p>
<p>16 April 2007</p>
<p>Come clean on apprenticeship failures, Dr Cullen</p>
<p>The Government continues to dodge questions on how many modern apprentices are failing, says National&#39;s Associate Education spokesman, Colin King.</p>
<p>&quot;Modern apprenticeship coordinators are expected to meet government standards of a 75% successful completion rate, yet Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen refuses to reveal whether that is happening.</p>
<p>&quot;Before Dr Cullen begins boasting about his 4,000th completed modern apprenticeship he must justify the $100 million of taxpayers&#39; money spent on the scheme by supplying reliable data on the success rate.</p>
<p>&quot;If it is all too hard for him, National is happy to show him how he can both measure and monitor the scheme with efficiency and transparency.</p>
<p>&quot;The coordinators know how many of their apprentices are failing and the $2000- per-apprentice payment must be made dependent on them providing proof of how many are no longer in the scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;It is totally irresponsible for this Government to glibly claim they don&#39;t know the number of failures, when there are only 48 coordinators nationally.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government wants 14,000 apprentices in the scheme by next year, which is an increase of 5,000 and will put a further $10 million in the coordinators&#39; pockets. Add the standard training measure made to polytechs of $16 million and you would expect some accountability.</p>
<p>&quot;If the success rate is as bad as we suspect, this has been an expensive exercise. Dr Cullen needs to justify the $100 million dollar expenditure of taxpayers&#39; money&quot;.</p>
