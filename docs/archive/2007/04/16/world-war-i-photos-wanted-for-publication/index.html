<p>World War I photos wanted for publication</p>
<p>Military historian and author Associate Professor Glyn Harper is appealing to the public for copies of historic WWI photographs to be reproduced in a definitive photographic record of New Zealand involvement in the Great War.</p>
<p>Dr Harper, Director of the Centre for Defence Studies at the University’s Palmerston North campus, will publish the book through HarperCollins Publishers New Zealand in association with the Queen Elizabeth II Army Memorial Museum.</p>
<p>Images of War will showcase unique and, in many cases, previously unpublished images from the Museum’s outstanding collection of photographs from the WWI period.</p>
<p>To compliment and extend its collection for the book, the Museum is calling for photographs covering all aspects of the war, including the Armistice in 1918 and the aftermath. Photographs might be live action shots; troops in location either immediately before or just after military action; wounded soldiers being treated; prisoners of war; artillery, tanks or machine guns firing; aircraft and battleships with a New Zealand connection; weapons training; soldiers in the trenches or of trench life; life behind the lines; soldiers on leave in France and Britain; military commanders, Victoria Cross winners; war animals including horses, mules, dogs and camels; war graves and anything that might be considered unusual or interesting.</p>
<p>Dr Harper is a leading military historian and the author of several highly regarded books on the subject, including most recently, In the Face of the Enemy: the complete history of the Victoria Cross and New Zealand.</p>

<p>Copies of photographs can be submitted either electronically in the form of a low resolution digital scan to <a href="mailto:editors@harpercollins.co.nz">editors@harpercollins.co.nz</a> or a photocopy by mail to Images of War Project, HarperCollins Publishers, Box 1, Auckland. Please do not send original photographs, but photocopies or electronic images only. All submissions should include full contact details.</p>
<p>Ideally, all photographs submitted should be accompanied by relevant information for accompanying captions. However, if the information is not available, people submitting photographs should just include what they know, as the unit and likely action can often be deduced by the experts.</p>
<p>Images of War will be published in time for Armistice Day, 11 November next year. Those whose photos are selected will receive a complimentary copy of the book.</p>
