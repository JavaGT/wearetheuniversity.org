<p>Right to roam still costing bundles</p>
<p>Rural Affairs Minister Damien O&#39;Connor needs to reveal how much taxpayer money he has wasted on Labour&#39;s right to roam agenda, says National&#39;s Agriculture spokesman, David Carter.</p>
<p>Answers to parliamentary questions show that to date Labour has spent $599,063 of taxpayer money on its Walking Access Consultation Panel.</p>
<p>&quot;The figure has risen by nearly $200,000 since February and it&#39;s not even the final bill.</p>
<p>&quot;The bill keeps going up. Is the work continuing by stealth, even though Labour has tried to give the impression they have backed down?</p>
<p>&quot;Rural New Zealanders will be outraged if that is the case.</p>
<p>&quot;What we know is that Labour is continuing to spend hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on a failed concept that was roundly rejected by landowners. Even city dwellers saw it for the attack on private property rights that it was. &quot;The right to roam plans caused angst and uncertainty for farmers, cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and in the end we were virtually left with the status quo.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone thought that was the end of it. Why won&#39;t Labour let it lie?&quot;</p>
