<p>Katherine Rich MP<br>National Party Education Spokeswoman</p>
<p>13 April 2007</p>
<p>Ministry &quot;obstructive&quot; over truancy stats</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has finally admitted truancy numbers are rising and very few prosecutions are being brought, says National&#39;s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>In a Radio New Zealand interview this morning the Ministry&#39;s acting deputy secretary, Martin Connelly, was called &#39;obstructive&#39; by the presenter for refusing to admit truancy numbers had increased by around 40% since 2001.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Connelly tried to spin the figures, using 2004 figures to minimise the increase, when there has been a clear upward trend since 2002.</p>
<p>&quot;He admitted that, despite a considerable increase in funding to Truancy Services and a pilot project targeting the problem, 30,000 students were still wagging every week and only 21 had been prosecuted.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Connelly refused to take responsibility for the problem, instead blaming schools for not taking action against truants.</p>
<p>&quot;However he did grudgingly admit that the Labour Government&#39;s $10 million dollar investment in truancy did not appear to be a raging success.</p>
<p>&quot;Education Minister Steve Maharey needs to explain how, exactly, he is planning to stem this ever-increasing rise in unexplained student absences when, clearly, whatever is being done now is not working.&quot;</p>
