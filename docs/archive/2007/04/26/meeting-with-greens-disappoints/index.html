<p><strong>Thursday, 26 April 2007, 9:55 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Meeting with Greens disappoints</p>
<p>It is disappointing that the Greens have declined to move on the anti-smacking bill in a way that gives good New Zealand parents confidence they won’t be criminalised by the legislation, says National Party Leader John Key.</p>
<p>He is commenting after a cordial 45 minute meeting this morning with Green MP Sue Bradford on her bill.</p>
<p>“This was a genuine attempt to find a resolution,” says Mr Key.</p>
<p>“National came to the table with a compromise on its previous position, which would have left the bill’s purpose clause unaltered but provided guidance to the authorities so that light smacking of a ‘minor and inconsequential’ nature would not have resulted in prosecution.</p>
<p>“That is the outcome I think all good parents want.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, Sue Bradford was clear that she did not want to see any movement in that direction.</p>
<p>“I’m deeply disappointed at the unwillingness of the Greens to compromise in any way, and I’m very frustrated for the hundreds of thousands of New Zealand parents who deserve better.</p>
<p>“Good parents want to have confidence that they won’t be criminalised by this legislation, but by passing the bill as it currently stands, Parliament won’t be providing that confidence.”</p>
