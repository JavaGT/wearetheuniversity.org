<p>New superbugs on the rise in New Zealand</p>
<p>An Environmental Science &amp; Research report which says New Zealand has new strains of bacteria that cause urinary infection resistant to multiple antibiotics, is extremely worrying says National’s Associate Health spokeswoman, Dr Jackie Blue.</p>
<p>The antibiotic resistance is caused by an enzyme (ESBL) that is produced by the bacteria.</p>
<p>The report found that while ESBL superbugs are widely established in the community, not all laboratories are testing for them.</p>
<p>The November 2006 report which reviewed samples from almost 90% of laboratories over a 4 week period, confirmed that the prevalence of the Klebsiella ESBL producing strain had gone from non-existent in 2000 to 4.2% in 2006.</p>
<p>A startling finding was that in Hawke’s Bay a staggering 40% of Klebsiella urinary infections were superbug producers. Other regions that had significant involvement were Wellington, Auckland and Canterbury which had rates of 5.7%, 5.3% and 2.1%.</p>
<p>Dr Blue says that while the cost and potential impact on hospitals would be considerable, of greater concern was that antibiotic options would eventually run out.</p>
<p>“Urinary infections normally respond to oral antibiotics, however with the new strains, people may need hospitalization and access to IV antibiotics.</p>
<p>“Guidelines need to be developed urgently on preventing cross infection, monitoring and treatment.</p>
<p>“On going education about appropriate antibiotic use was essential to prevent further antibiotic resistance occurring.</p>
<p>“These new superbug strains are already well established internationally.</p>
<p>“While New Zealand has lagged behind because of its relative isolation, these new superbugs are here.</p>
<p>“We don&#39;t have the luxury of being complacent.”</p>
