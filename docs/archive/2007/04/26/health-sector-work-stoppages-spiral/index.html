<p>Hon Tony Ryall MP National Party Health Spokesman</p>

<p>Health sector work stoppages spiral</p>
<p>Disruption in the health sector has hit new highs, with latest figures showing thousands more days lost to industrial action than at any other time this decade, says National&#39;s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>Figures from Statistics New Zealand show that in 2006 the number of days lost by hospital strikes ballooned to 11,562 compared to just 1,750 in 2000. A record number of health workers have been involved too.</p>
<p>&quot;More money than ever is being pumped into the health system. Yet this year is stumbling along in the same way as the old year finished - in a fog of workplace mistrust, with more and more patients paying the price.</p>
<p>Already in 2007, radiation therapists, radiographers and lab workers have resorted to industrial action. Today, for the third time this month, laboratory workers are striking.</p>
<p>&quot;Widespread strike action is more than just an employment issue,&quot; says Mr Ryall &quot;Thousands of patients are being affected by ongoing industrial action - surgeries are being cancelled and other treatments delayed.</p>
<p>&quot;Industrial action in our hospitals is becoming commonplace and it&#39;s at the expense of patients. Labour once considered the health system the jewel in its crown. But their $4 billion extra each year hasn&#39;t bought more services or higher morale - in fact, they have achieved the opposite.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is standing up for the patients? It certainly isn&#39;t the Health Minister. He&#39;s continuing to hide in his office instead of banging heads together to get this mess sorted out.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s regime prevents DHBs from talking directly to their employees. This is clearly contributing to the climate of mistrust that has so become part of the hospital scene in NZ.&quot;</p>
