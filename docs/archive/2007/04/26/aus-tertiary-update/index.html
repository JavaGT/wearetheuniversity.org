<p>Auckland good faith case to go ahead</p>
<p>The AUS case against the University of Auckland for breaches of good faith has now been set down in the Employment Relations Authority for 1 and 3 August. The case relates to actions by the University in 2005 and 2006 which AUS believes were designed to undermine the collective agreement and were in breach of a decision by the Employment Court in 2005 establishing what employers can and cannot do during bargaining.</p>
<p>General Secretary Helen Kelly said it was disappointing to be back in litigation with the Vice-Chancellor again, despite the union offering many alternative ways in which relationships could be managed constructively. She said that the Vice-Chancellor continued to act in a way that was unacceptable to the union and which the union believes does not comply with the legal requirements of the Employment Relations Act. That leaves the union with no alternative to expensive and time-wasting litigation.</p>
<p>”In no other university do we experience such behaviour,” said Helen Kelly. ”The Auckland approach seeks deliberately to minimise the role of the union in members’ and non-members’ eyes, when our preferred approach is to work with universities collaboratively to further the interests of the sector.”</p>
<p>”As an HR strategy it is narrow and unconstructive, in contrast to the union’s alternative approach, which requires a high level of trust and respect for each other&#39;s roles,” she said. ”Our view is that Auckland University as an institution has suffered generally from a non-cooperative and competitive approach by its leadership and that this impacts in a range of areas in which our members are involved, and eventually on the institution’s ability to perform to its maximum potential.&quot;</p>

<p>She called on the Auckland University Council, the body responsible for the performance of the University, to talk to the union about the troubles it was having in the union/employer relationship and about the union’s ideas and aspirations for the University.</p>

<p>New national standards for teaching graduates</p>
<p>The New Zealand Teachers’ Council has this week announced a new set of standards for the quality of teacher graduates in the areas of professional knowledge, professional practice and professional values and relationships.</p>
<p>The seven standards require that graduating teachers know what to teach; know about learners and how they learn; understand how contextual factors affect teaching and learning; plan for a safe, high-quality teaching and learning environment; use evidence to promote learning; develop professional relationships with learners and members of learning communities; and are committed members of the profession. The standards set out what student teachers need to achieve to qualify as teachers and to apply for provisional registration.</p>
<p>Dr Peter Lind, Director of the Teachers’ Council, said, “From January 2008, teacher-education providers such as universities and other tertiary institutions will have to show that new teaching programmes align with the Graduating Teacher Standards if they are to gain approval to run the programmes.” The Council will review its processes and guidelines for approving teacher-education programmes by December 2007 in consultation with the quality-assurance agencies, teachers’ unions and teacher-education providers.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Education Institute Te Riu Roa welcomed the standards, with National President Irene Cooper saying, “Our student teachers have been expressing their concern about inconsistencies in the quality of their study programmes for some time. They will welcome the requirement that teacher-education providers will have to ensure that their programmes meet the new standards.”</p>
<p>Irene Cooper said that teaching is a demanding and challenging profession and teachers are constantly having to update their knowledge and skills. “We need to ensure that we provide the time and resources needed so that teachers have access to professional development throughout their career.</p>
<p>Government seeks feedback on new International Education Agenda</p>
<p>The Government has issued a discussion document on its International Education Agenda 2007-2012. The document declares that New Zealand needs “a more integrated, sustainable and forward-thinking approach to international education which goes well beyond the traditional ‘export education’ focus”.</p>
<p>As well as examining the economic benefits of international students studying in New Zealand, the discussion document identifies other dimensions such as exposing more New Zealand students to international experiences and interactions and developing teachers and researchers through greater international collaboration.</p>
<p>The document outlines four goals for international education: domestic students equipped to thrive in an inter-connected world; international students enriched by living and learning in New Zealand; domestic providers strengthened academically and financially; and wider economic and social benefits to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Tertiary Education Minister Dr Michael Cullen said the International Education Agenda outlines “a new approach while continuing to build on the achievements of recent years.”</p>
<p>The deadline for feedback is 25 May 2007, and the document can be found at <a href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz/goto/international">www.minedu.govt.nz/goto/international</a></p>
<p>Nursing shortage at crisis levels</p>
<p>Nursing shortages in New Zealand are at crisis level owing to the ageing workforce, graduates heading overseas and the global shortage of nurses, according to Dr Annette Huntington from Massey University’s School of Health Sciences.</p>
<p>Dr Huntington says that the average age of New Zealand nurses is now forty-five, and Australia is “aggressively recruiting” from New Zealand, attracting 900 nurses across the Tasman in 2003. They were joined by a quarter of the nurses graduating from a recent class at Massey University.</p>
<p>Researchers from the School of Health Sciences, in partnership with the University of Queensland, are using on-line questionnaires in the Nurses’ E-Cohort Study to track the health, wellbeing and workforce participation of New Zealand nurses. The study is establishing a database to inform workforce policy and planning, with the aim of improving the recruitment and retention of New Zealand nurses.</p>
<p>According to Dr Huntington, New Zealand nurses are highly sought after on the international market. “New Zealand will continue to lose its qualified nurses to countries with stronger economies and better pay and conditions.”</p>
<p>“Accurate data is essential for the planning and management of the nursing workforce if this pressure is not to overwhelm our health services,” added Dr Huntington.</p>

<p>May Day and Workers’ Memorial Day events</p>
<p>May Day and Workers’ Memorial events begin on Saturday 28 April in various locations around the country.</p>
<p>In Auckland, a combined May Day and Workers’ Memorial dinner is being held on Saturday 28 April, followed by the May Day celebrations on 1 May, with an open mike from 5.00 pm at the corner of Queen and Customs Sts, and a march at 5.30pm to Aotea Square.</p>
<p>Events will also be held in Palmerston North, Wellington, West Coast, Christchurch and Dunedin. Full details of events are at <a href="http://www.union.org.nz/campaigns/workers">www.union.org.nz/campaigns/workers</a> memorialday07</p>

<p>Research to examine the everyday life of bogans</p>
<p>Dave Snell, a doctoral student from Waikato University, will be delving into the world of head-banging, tattoos and body piercing in his study “The Everyday Life of Bogans: Identity and Community Among Heavy Metal Fans”.</p>
<p>Self-confessed bogan Snell says bogans offer a good case study of the importance of identity to different groups of people.</p>
<p>National MP Paul Hutchinson took issue with the $96,000 doctoral grant awarded to Snell, questioning whether it was the best use of scarce resources. However, the Tertiary Education Commission and University management defended the study, Waikato University’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford saying that the scholarships “acknowledge our brightest scholars and we are very proud of them”.</p>

<p>Staff say jury still out on “Melbourne Model”</p>
<p>University of Melbourne staff say the jury is still out on the merits of the “Melbourne Model” .of new general undergraduate and professional graduate degrees. Melbourne University recently announced the new degree structure, influenced by North American universities with professional degrees such as law, architecture and secondary teaching moving to graduate schools.</p>
<p>“There is a great diversity of views among the University’s staff about the merits and potential disadvantages of the proposed Melbourne Model,” said Matt McGowan, Victorian Secretary of the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU). “In particular, there is a great deal of debate about the implications of the changes for equity of access to Melbourne University, and the balance of students attending on HECS, scholarships and full-fee-paying places.”</p>
<p>“The issue of student access to the professions on an affordable basis is a serious concern given indications that a number of other universities are giving consideration to adopting changes similar to those proposed by the Melbourne Model,” said McGowan.</p>
<p>Ted Clark, President of the University of Melbourne NTEU Branch, said that the Union is also concerned about the impact of the model on working hours and job security. He said that the support of staff is vital to the success of the Melbourne Model.</p>
<p>Scots funding model to decrease compliance load</p>
<p>The Scottish Funding Council (SFC) is breaking new ground with a consultation paper that aims to ensure that governing bodies genuinely take responsibility for running tertiary institutions rather than assume that the Funding Council is in charge. The consultation could lead to the SFC dropping many of its data requirements.</p>
<p>Roger McClure, SFC Chief Executive, said that the emphasis would be on quality of data rather than endless quantity. He predicted that this would reinforce governing bodies’ responsibilities and autonomy, leading to continual improvement in the quality of their decision-making. “You’re no longer filling in forms for the Funding Council but displaying to your own local stakeholders how you feel you’re doing.”</p>
<p>“Although administrators would gain most from the potential changes, academics should find their chores cut, too,” he added.</p>

<p>Iranian students penalised for political activity</p>
<p>Iran’s “starred” students, politically active university students barred from continuing with their studies, are desperately trying to obtain the right to go on with their education. Undergraduates who have criticised the Government are given one to three penalty points, according to the possible threat they are said to pose. About 150 students are currently starred. Those who have been registered for Master’s courses have been forced to do so under pre-set conditions which allow university officials to expel the students at any time. “Three-starred” students are not allowed to register.</p>
<p>At least seventeen three-starred students have been refused registration for the new academic year by university officials, despite passing Iran’s difficult Master’s degree entry exams.</p>
