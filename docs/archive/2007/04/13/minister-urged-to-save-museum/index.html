<p>Minister urged to save museum</p>
<p>National’s Defence spokesman, Wayne Mapp, says the one-month stay of execution given to the Ohakea Air Force museum, must be used wisely.</p>
<p>The museum, which houses important Air Force memorabilia, was due to be closed on Saturday due to uncertainty over the site it is on, but the public outcry has caused a re-think.</p>
<p>“It’s a pity the board hasn’t consulted the community before now, but they must do so in the next month.</p>
<p>“And it’s well past time the Minister of Culture and Heritage got involved.</p>
<p>“Where has Judith Tizard been while this historical collection is being boxed up?</p>
<p>“It’s her job to preserve such treasures so all New Zealanders can access them.</p>
<p>“The Minister should be meeting the local mayors to find a solution that will allow the collection to stay in the region.”</p>
<p>“Locals have spent thousands of dollars on the museum and donated much of the collection; therefore it is only right that such a valuable historical treasure remain with the people whose efforts made it possible.”</p>
