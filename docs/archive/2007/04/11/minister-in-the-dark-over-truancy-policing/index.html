<p>Minister in the dark over truancy policing</p>
<p>It&#39;s no wonder New Zealand&#39;s school truancy rate has increased 41% since 2002, when the Education Minister doesn&#39;t even know how many truancy officers are in the field, says National Party Education spokeswoman Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister was asked a simple parliamentary question &#39;ow many How many frontline truancy officers are working in New Zealand, and where are they based?&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is appalling that an Education Minister could just shrug his shoulders and claim the Ministry did not collect such information.</p>
<p>&quot;When truancy has risen at such a frightening rate under Labour, it&#39;s a worry that the Minister has absolutely no idea how many truancy officers are out there combating the problem, says Mrs Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey should be ashamed of the figures. The truancy rate rose from 2.9% of students in 2002, to 3.4 percent in 2004 and last year peaked at a whopping 4.1 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;In light of such a damning track record, most kiwis would expect the Minister to have some idea how many officers are chasing down the more than 30,000 students wagging school each week.&quot;</p>
