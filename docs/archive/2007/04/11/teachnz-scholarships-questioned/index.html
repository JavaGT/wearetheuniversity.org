<p>TeachNZ scholarships questioned</p>
<p>Taxpayers are owed nearly $360,000 from scholarships given out by TeachNZ to students who changed their minds, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>TeachNZ is a unit of the Ministry of Education which offers scholarships to students who train in areas of priority need such as early childhood, Maori and specialist secondary subjects, as well as those who would like to teach in rural areas.</p>
<p>“$289,000 has been paid to early childhood teachers who have not completed their studies and only $25,000 has been paid back, as required.”</p>
<p>“Would-be maori teachers who have not completed their teacher qualification have been paid $54,000 and not a cent of that has been repaid to TeachNZ.</p>
<p>“Nearly $17,000 was granted to five students who wanted to teach in rural areas who have since changed their minds, and TeachNZ does not even require that money to be paid back.</p>
<p>“And in specialist subject secondary teaching more than $111,000 has been wasted on students who didn’t complete their training. But at least, in this case, $93,000 has been paid back to the government.”</p>
<p>Only 60% of recipients of the early childhood and Maori medium scholarships complete courses and Mrs Rich says that the repayment rate is ‘dismal’.</p>
<p>“The Minister needs to ensure that recipients have a clear understanding that receiving additional taxpayer support is only on the proviso they actually complete their course. If they don’t, the money should be repaid.”</p>
<p>She says she understands that sometimes people begin a course and find it’s not for them, but they should still be obliged to repay taxpayers money.</p>
<p>“All legal steps need to be taken to collect funds from people who have not kept their side of the bargain.”</p>
