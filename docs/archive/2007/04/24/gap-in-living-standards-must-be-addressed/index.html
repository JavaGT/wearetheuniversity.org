<p>&#39;Persistent Gap in Living Standards Must be Addressed&#39; says Maori Party<br>Dr Pita Sharples and Tariana Turia, Co-leaders of the Maori Party</p>
<p>Tuesday 24 April 2007</p>
<p>“Results of the 2007 OECD Economic Survey of New Zealand confirm the urgent need to address what the report describes as a “persistent gap in living standards with the rest of the OECD”’ stated Dr Pita Sharples, Co-leader of the Maori Party.</p>
<p>“It is of course disappointing to see our total economy labour productivity growth described as ‘lacklustre’ and to learn that our household debt (at around 160% of disposable income) is a ratio that is much higher than in other OECD countries” said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>“From our recent tour throughout various parts of Aotearoa, we know the very real hardship that many Maori communities are reporting – and have been consistently reporting for some years now” stated Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>“But what this report does is to point out to our international shame, that our living standards in Aotearoa have remained some 16% below the OECD median for some years” stated Tariana Turia, Co-leader of the Maori Party.</p>
<p>The OECD report stated that it is still not well understood why the gap in living standards has persisted.</p>
<p>It also identifies the need to develop a better understanding of “why New Zealanders borrow so much and save so little in the face of high interest rates”.</p>
<p>“We may not know why – but we certainly know who is most affected by the grip of poverty” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>The Living Standards report released in July 2006, revealed that there have been ‘significant increases’ of Māori and Pacific people, beneficiaries and low-income families with children in the proportions of people in &quot;severe hardship&quot;. 38% of all children are described in hardship categories.</p>

<p>“As such, the Maori Party welcomes the fact that the OECD report has issued a ‘key challenge to raise national incomes’” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>The OECD Report also urged the nation to “require a sharper focus on outcomes, particularly reducing under-achievement of Maori and Pacific Island youth”.</p>
<p>“How many times does this Government need to be told about the dire predicament facing many Maori and Pasifika school leavers before action is taken?” asked Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>The proportion of Maori students who leave school with qualifications higher than level one, is up to thirty percentage points behind other students. In 2004, 74% of European and 87% of Asian students left school with qualifications higher than NCEA Level 1; compared to 47% of Maori students.</p>
<p>&quot;The conclusions of the report are clear&quot; said Dr Sharples. &quot;More questions need to be asked about the economic system and the creation of rich and poor individuals and nations&quot;.</p>
