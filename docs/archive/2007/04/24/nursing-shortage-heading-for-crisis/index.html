<p>Nursing shortage heading for crisis</p>
<p>The shortage of nurses in New Zealand is heading for crisis levels, due to an ageing workforce, graduates heading overseas, and a global nursing shortage, says a nursing workforce researcher.</p>
<p>Dr Annette Huntington from the School of Health Sciences on the Wellington campus says with the average age of nurses at 45, many are approaching retirement.</p>
<p>Australia is aggressively recruiting from New Zealand, with more than 900 nurses heading there in 2003, the most recent year for which figures are available.</p>
<p>It is not known what that figure is now but anecdotal evidence is that it may have worsened. A quarter of nurses from a recent class at Massey University moved to jobs in Australia.</p>
<p>The issue is a global one, says Dr Huntington. “New Zealand nurses are very desirable on the international market.</p>
<p>“New Zealand will continue to lose its qualified nurses to countries with stronger economies and better pay and conditions.</p>
<p>“The issue of whether we can replace them from poorer developing countries is increasingly an ethical debate, when those countries are also facing a shortage and are arguably in greater need.</p>
<p>“Nurses are the backbone of health services. Our 45,000 registered nurses make up approximately 60 per cent of New Zealand’s health workforce.”</p>
<p>Just over half work in district health boards, with the rest in areas such as aged care, primary care, Maori health providers, the prison services, defence and private hospitals.</p>

<p>“Although pay has improved for nurses working in DHBs, it has lagged behind for other nurses.</p>
<p>“We have a small window of opportunity to address the issues before the shortage becomes acute.”</p>
<p>Researchers from the School of Health Sciences are tracking nurses’ health, wellbeing and patterns of workforce participation using on-line questionnaires, in the Nurses’ E-Cohort Study. The study is establishing a database to improve workforce policy and planning, with the aim of encouraging the recruitment and retention of New Zealand nurses.</p>
<p>“Accurate data is essential for the planning and management of the nursing workforce if this pressure is not to overwhelm our health services,” says Dr Huntington.</p>
<p>The Nurses’ E-Cohort Study is a collaborative venture between the University of Queensland and Massey University’s School of Health Sciences.</p>
