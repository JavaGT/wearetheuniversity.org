<p>Record turnout for Young Labour<br>Wednesday, 18 April 2007</p>
<p>Over 70 young people gathered at Parliament last weekend for the annual Young Labour conference of the Labour Party.</p>
<p>This was the largest conference in over 25 years, following the largest turn out at a Labour Party conference last year.</p>
<p>Young Labour President Meg Bates said of the impressive delegation: &quot;It is<br>obvious Labour remains the party of choice for young New Zealanders. It&#39;s also clear from our increasing membership that young people are choosing to get involved in the Labour Party to make a positive contribution to our society.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It isn&#39;t just the youth sector that is increasing in membership and<br>activity, the Labour Party as a whole is growing across the country,<br>despite being three terms into government. This bodes very well for the<br>2008 general election&quot;, Ms Bates said.</p>
<p>Among the issues debated at the conference was the challenge of climate<br>change. The conference was organised around a &quot;carbon neutral&quot; theme, with delegates accounting for their carbon usage as they travelled to and from Wellington. The total carbon usage, calculated at around 3.3 tonnes, will be offset by Young Labour members planting native trees in various native restoration projects around the country.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark set a challenge for New Zealand last year to become the<br>world&#39;s first carbon neutral nation. This is a goal that Young Labour<br>shares unreservedly. We proudly stand with her as we strive to meet this<br>goal, and our members plan to get active at a community level to help<br>the government achieve this.&quot;</p>
