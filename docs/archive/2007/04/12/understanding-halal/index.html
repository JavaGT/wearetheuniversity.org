<p>Understanding Halal</p>
<p>The opportunities for New Zealand in providing halal products to the Islamic world is the focus of a seminar to be held at Victoria University of Wellington.</p>
<p>Understanding Halal: Business Opportunities for New Zealand will be held on April 16 at Victoria University’s Pipitea Campus in downtown Wellington.</p>
<p>The seminar has been organised by the Malaysian Government, in collaboration with the Chair of Malay Studies at Victoria University and the Victoria University Foundation and is part of the University’s annual Saad Lecture programme. The Saad Lecture programme was established by an endowment by Tan Sri Halim Saad, a Victoria alumnus and Chairman of the Saad Foundation.</p>
<p>Professor Othman bin Mohd Yatim, who joined Victoria this year as the Chair in Malay Studies for 2007-8, said Halal (حلال or halaal) was an Arabic word that meant ‘permissible’.</p>
<p>“While in Western countries it is most frequently used to refer to food that is prepared in a way that is permissible according to Islamic law, in the Muslim world and in Arabic it refers to anything that is permissible under Islam.”</p>
<p>The half-day seminar, to be chaired by Brian Lynch, Director of the New Zealand Institute of International Affairs, will not only examine halal in relation to food but also other forms of trade, including banking.</p>
<p>Speakers at the seminar include: Malaysian Agriculture Minister, Hon Tan Sri Haji Muhyiddin Bin Haji Mohd Yassin, who will give a key note address; Dato’ Abd Manap Bin Abd Wahab, Chief Executive of Bank Muamalat Malaysia; and Professor Yaakob Bin Che Man from the University Putra Malaysia.</p>
