<p>Minister tries to wriggle out of teen pregnancy comments</p>
<p>The Education Minister is desperately trying to retreat from his comments that it’s practical for pregnant teens to remain in mainstream schools right up to the birth of their baby, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>“Steve Maharey is now saying his comments were taken out of context, which is rubbish. My question to him was: ‘Does the Minister think it’s practical for pregnant teenagers to remain in mainstream schools right up to the birth of their baby?’</p>
<p>“His reply was, ‘I do think it’s practical for pregnant teenagers to remain in mainstream schools and attending classes up until the birth of their baby. Pregnant teenagers have been, and continue to be, supported to attend classes up until the birth of their baby in some schools around New Zealand.’</p>
<p>“His standpoint is quite clear and his comments were reported in the exact same context as they were made. The Minister is obviously now feeling the heat from young mothers who find his comments extraordinary.</p>
<p>“National’s Associate Education spokeswoman, Paula Bennett, and I have visited many of New Zealand’s teen parent units. These schools are vital to keeping young women learning while they are pregnant and after the birth of their baby. We’ve also spoken to girls who have continued their education through correspondence school.</p>
<p>“Not one said she would have felt comfortable at her local school in the later stages of her pregnancy. They were worried about schoolyard teasing, their changing body shapes, negative reactions from classmates, and the proximity of ex-boyfriends.</p>

<p>“Principals also have concerns. They know it’s important to keep the girls learning but worry about the message having a pregnant teen at school sends to other students. They also recognise they are not resourced to deal with pregnant students.</p>
<p>“Steve Maharey’s ideological preference for mainstreaming heavily pregnant teenagers will come up against major opposition from parents, schools and the young women themselves.</p>
<p>“It’s time he stopped hiding behind the present moratorium on teen parent units and explained exactly how his strategy for pregnant teens is going to work in schools.”</p>
