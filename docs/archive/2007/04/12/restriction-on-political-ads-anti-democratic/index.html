<p><strong>Thursday, 12 April 2007, 11:18 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Bill English MP<br>National Party Deputy Leader</p>
<p>12 April 2007</p>
<p>Restriction on political ads anti-democratic</p>
<p>Instead of attacking those calling for details of Labour&#39;s election spending proposals, Mark Burton should reveal why it plans to extend the period that political advertising is restricted, says National Party Deputy Leader Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;And while he&#39;s at it, Mr Burton should explain whether Labour plans to hand itself an advantage in election year by continuing to allow government department advertising of Labour initiatives, as reports this week suggest.</p>
<p>&quot;Millions of taxpayer dollars have already been spent on advertising for things like Working for Families, ACC and 20 hours free.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not good enough to expect other political parties - and the public - to put up with this propaganda at the same time as tightly restricting political advertising in the calendar year in which an election falls, instead of during the last three months before an election.</p>
<p>&quot;That is clearly anti-democratic and another example of how Labour&#39;s proposals are designed to suit itself and disadvantage every other political party.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour wants to shut down those who disagree with it.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Burton talks of openness and transparency in election spending rules - so how come he&#39;s refusing to reveal any details of what Labour is proposing?</p>
<p>&quot;National believes significant electoral reform, such as that proposed, should get broad political consensus.</p>
<p>&quot;The Labour Government should end this dance of the thousand veils right now, and start consulting the public and other political parties.</p>
<p>&quot;Consultation when the legislation is introduced to the House is not consultation at all. That&#39;s called ramming it through - and that&#39;s totally anti-democratic.&quot;</p>
