<p>Date 12 April 2007<br>Media Statement</p>
<p>New Zealand Made Showcase Comes to Christchurch</p>
<p>Local Businesses on Show</p>
<p>Whittaker&#39;s Peanut Slabs, LWR&#39;s Southern Alp Socks, Pink Batts(r) and The Beautiful Box Company have one thing in common - they&#39;re all Kiwi Made. These well-known national brands are featured as part of the Christchurch New Zealand Made Showcase that will be held in the Christchurch Town Hall tomorrow, Friday 13 April.</p>
<p>&quot;The New Zealand Made Showcase in Christchurch is part of a wider government programme to celebrate and promote New Zealand made products and manufacturing success. New Zealanders will have the opportunity to explore these and other iconic kiwi products at the showcase,&quot; Sue Bradford, Government Spokesperson for Buy Kiwi Made said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The $11.5 million campaign also aims to increase consumer recognition of branding that identifies products as New Zealand made and promote voluntary branding and labelling for that purpose,&quot; said Ms Bradford.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Made Showcase, developed in close co-operation with Business New Zealand&#39;s Buy New Zealand Made programme, is one of six regional showcases with the Christchurch showcase being the second.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re delighted to see so many local and national businesses wanting to participate in the Showcase and I am pleased to say 28 of the 54 companies that have been selected to be a part of today&#39;s celebrations are already members of the Buy New Zealand Made Campaign Ltd,&quot; said Business New Zealand Chief Executive, Phil O&#39;Reilly, on behalf of the Buy New Zealand Made Campaign Ltd.</p>
