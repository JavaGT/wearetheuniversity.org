<p>Seven hundred and seventy-three degrees, diplomas and certificates will be awarded at Lincoln University’s 2007 Graduation Ceremony in Christchurch Town Hall on Friday afternoon. (20 April)</p>
<p>“This is the highest number since the year 2000,” says Academic Services Manager Dr Gill Jordan, “and the range of qualifications being awarded continues to reflect the distinctive contribution Lincoln University makes to New Zealand’s productivity and sustainable economic growth through the sciences, agriculture, commerce and other nationally important disciplines.”</p>
<p>Five hundred and eighty-two of the qualifications will be presented in person and the balance awarded in absentia.</p>
<p>Nearly 20 percent of the awards are postgraduate qualifications, and this includes 13 doctorates.</p>
<p>The largest single category of degrees is Bachelor of Commerce and Management,193, followed by Bachelor of Commerce (Agriculture), 50.</p>
<p>Over 20 percent of the qualifications - undergraduate and postgraduate combined - are specifically in the area of agriculture, horticulture, viticulture and oenology.</p>
<p>Two honorary doctorates are being conferred - on sporting legend Sir Bob Charles and top New Zealand businesswoman Peri Drysdale of Untouched World. Sir Bob receives a Doctor of Natural Resources honoris causa and Mrs Drysdale a Doctor of Commerce honoris causa.</p>
<p>Lincoln University’s Bledisloe Medal for outstanding contributions to New Zealand’s interests goes to the retired Chief Executive of the Health Research Council of New Zealand, Dr Bruce Scoggins of Auckland, and the Lincoln University Alumni International Medal, for distinguished contributions in a country outside New Zealand, is being presented to Australian beef industry leader Mr Don Lawson of Victoria.
