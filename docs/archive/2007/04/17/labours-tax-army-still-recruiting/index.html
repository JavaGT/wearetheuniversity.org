<p>Craig Foss MP<br>National Party Associate Finance Spokesman</p>
<p>17 April 2007</p>
<p>Labour’s tax army still recruiting</p>
<p>&quot;Labour’s taxation addiction has led to a situation where the increase in the number of tax gatherers has outstripped the bid to recruit 1,000 new police,” says National Party Associate Finance spokesman Craig Foss.</p>
<p>Answers to parliamentary questions reveal the number of staff employed by Inland Revenue has increased by 1,212, since 1999 and the amount spent on consultants has increased a staggering 344% since 1999.</p>
<p>A total of 324 consultants, contractors and consultancy firms were used by IRD in 2006, compared to 73 in 1999. In 1999, Helen Clark pledged to cut back on consultants.</p>
<p>“It’s hard not to measure the rhetoric with the record here. It seems the pledge to crack down on consultants was yet another empty promise.”</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
<p>Headline numbers:</p>
<p>- IRD staff increase between 1999 - 2006 was 1,212, (4,220 to 5,432).</p>
<p>- IRD Consultant spend 1999 vs 2006 - $4m to $27.8m.</p>
<p>- Number of consultants etc used 1999 vs. 2006 - 73 to 324</p>
<p>- Total salary bill $187m to $264m</p>

<p>What was the total amount spent on consultants by his department<br>in each year since 1998?</p>
<p>Hon Peter Dunne [Minister of Revenue] replied:</p>
<p>The following table sets out the total amount spent on consultants and contractors by Inland Revenue for each financial year since 1998.</p>
<p>Year Consultants and Contractors<br>2006/07* $13,754,000*<br>2005/06 $27,835,000<br>2004/05 $12,464,000<br>2003/04 $10,659,000<br>2002/03 $9,894,000<br>2001/02 $6,834,000<br>2000/01 $6,235,000<br>1999/00 $7,394,000<br>1998/99 $4,072,000<br>1997/98 $4,298,000</p>
<p>*The 2007 figure includes expenditure for the eight months of the current year up to and including February 2007.</p>
<p>About 60% of expenditure on contractors and consultants relates to the development and implementation of Inland Revenue’s Information Technology projects. IT design is specialist in nature, and Inland Revenue’s approach has been to contract in this expertise where required. The increase in 2005/06 reflects the resources required in these areas in order to implement Government initiatives including KiwiSaver, Working for Families and Student Loan changes.</p>
