<p>Flags fly high as NZ Uni Games open</p>
<p>Stilt-walkers bearing the flags of New Zealand’s 10 universities will ensure the 2007 University Games start off on a high note.</p>
<p>The games officially open in Christchurch tomorrow night (subs: April 10) with a formal ceremony in the Quad at Canterbury University’s Ilam campus. Circus performers will mingle with the crowds in the lead-up to the opening, which will begin at 6pm with a spine-tingling kapa haka performance.</p>
<p>Stiltwalkers carrying the flags of the 10 universities competing for the coveted Shield will parade through the Quad during the night-time ceremony, which the public is welcome to attend.</p>
<p>More than 2100 students have gathered in Christchurch for the Games, which are the second largest annual multi-sport event in New Zealand. At stake is the University Shield and the right to claim sporting supremacy. Victoria University currently holds the Shield but is facing a strong challenge this year from the home team, Canterbury, which is fielding the largest team in the history of the Games.</p>
<p>University Sport New Zealand (USNZ) games director Jake Wilkins is expecting strong rivalry, on-and-off-the-field, between the universities over the three days of competition. The students will be competing in 28 sports at venues across Christchurch and Canterbury.</p>
<p>“The Shield is a pretty sought after sporting trophy and we’ve got some very talented sportspeople competing this year so I think we will see a very high standard of competition,’’ Mr Wilkins says.</p>

<p>Otago University, which boasts the most Shield wins (35) of any university, has sent a 370-strong team north for the Games while Victoria University, the current Shield holders, have sent a team of 300. It’s aiming to win its first back-to-back titles.</p>
<p>University Sport New Zealand is working in partnership with Canterbury University, the University of Canterbury Students’ Association, the Christchurch City Council, Sport Canterbury and the New Zealand Community Trust to bring the Games to Christchurch. The Games officially close on Friday.</p>
<p>MEDIA ARE INVITED TO ATTEND THE OPENING CEREMONY ON TUESDAY, APRIL 10. THE FORMAL CEREMONY WILL BEGIN AT 6PM IN THE UNIVERSITY QUAD (IN FRONT OF THE REGISTRY BUILDING).</p>
