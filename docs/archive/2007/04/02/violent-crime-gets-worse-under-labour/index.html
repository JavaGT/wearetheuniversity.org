<p>Simon Power MP<br>National Party Justice Spokesman</p>
<p>2 March 2007</p>
<p>Violent crime gets worse under Labour</p>
<p>The 2006 crime statistics show the Labour-NZ First Government continues to preside over ever-worsening crime figures, and particularly violent crime, says National&#39;s Justice spokesman, Simon Power.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government crows about how it is on top of crime, but in 2006 it increased by 4.1%.</p>
<p>&quot;But most disturbingly, violent crime has continued the upward trend evident since this Government was elected.&quot;</p>
<p>Violent crime increased 5% over 2005, with kidnapping and abduction up 30%, robbery 27%, grievous assaults 7.3%, and serious assaults 6.7%.</p>
<p>Since 2000, violent crime has risen by 22%, from 41,573 to 50,731 offences, with kidnapping and abduction up 65%, robbery 57%, grievous assaults 51%, and serious assaults up 25%.</p>
<p>&quot;These figures show a very alarming increase in the intensity of violence across the community, with 10 of the 12 police districts recording increases.</p>
<p>&quot;This is all about crimes against people, and this Government is not delivering safer communities.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear from these figures that crime is now much nastier, and this is a major concern.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour can use all the excuses they want, but the fact of the matter is that crime - and particularly violent and sex crimes - have risen steadily under them.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government should also be very concerned at increases in crime in places like Counties-Manukau (up 10.5%), Waikato (9.5%), Central (7.4%), Eastern 7%), Waitemata (5.8%).</p>

<p>&quot;With overall crime up in 9 of the 12 police districts, it is clear the problems are not restricted to one or two areas.</p>
<p>&quot;These figures are an indictment on Labour&#39;s crime prevention strategies and make a joke of claims they are on top of the problem.&quot;</p>
<p>The statistics also show:</p>
<p>* Sex crimes are up 7.7%, sexual attacks up 13.6%.</p>
<p>* Burglaries up 6.1%, dishonesty 60%, receiving stolen goods 31%</p>
<p>* Drugs and anti-social offences up 6%, with busts for new drugs (&#39;P&#39;) up 19%.</p>
