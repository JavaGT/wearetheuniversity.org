<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>2 April 2007</p>
<p>Adjunct Professor of Official Statistics appointed</p>
<p>Statistics New Zealand, in conjunction with the Victoria University of Wellington’s School of Government, today announced the appointment of Dr Sharleen Forbes to the position of Adjunct Professor of Official Statistics.</p>
<p>Dr Forbes will balance her current part-time role at Statistics New Zealand in the area of statistical education and research, with her new role in supporting academic leadership in official statistics at Victoria University.</p>
<p>Dr Forbes will contribute to the development of teaching and research programmes in official statistics. Progressing education in statistics has been a long-term interest for Dr Forbes, who has a doctoral degree in mathematics education.</p>
<p>Acting Government Statistician Dallas Welch, and Professor Gary Hawke, Head of Victoria University’s School of Government congratulated Dr Forbes on her appointment.</p>
<p>“This new position reflects a shared desire by both organisations to build statistical capability across the public sector, and to ensure that objective evidence-based decision making is brought to the forefront in national life,” they said.</p>
