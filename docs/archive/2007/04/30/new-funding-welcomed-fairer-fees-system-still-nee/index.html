<p>New Funding Welcomed, Fairer Fees System Still Needed</p>
<p>Students are welcoming today’s announcement for new public money for the polytechnic sector and wananga, but remind government that student fees must be addressed as part of the new funding regime.</p>
<p>“Public tertiary institutions, particularly polytechnics, have been starved of funding for their core business for too long,” said Joseph Randall, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA), which represents students in the Polytechnic and University sector. “Students and institutions alike will welcome the greater certainty of the three year funding system. The funding increase is a good start to bringing polytechnics out of the red although given the current financial situation of many institutions this may not prove enough.”</p>
<p>“However, there is still a great deal of uncertainty around student fees,” said Randall. “Kiwi tuition fees are some of the highest in the world, and have continued to grow well ahead of inflation. The new funding system should also plan to bring fees down with greater levels of public investment.”</p>
<p>NZUSA is concerned that tuition fees are the poor cousin of the review of funding policies. Randall said that it was good news that funding levels and quality of courses were being addressed through the Investment Plan process, but that the tertiary system was still based on unfair expectations on students and their families.</p>
<p>“Quality and relevance need to be balanced by equal access to tertiary education. If government has greater certainty that it is funding quality, relevant courses, it needs to start lifting the fees burden off students.”</p>
