<p>Katherine Rich MP<br>National Party Education Spokeswoman</p>

<p>Failed science experiments? No problem for an NCEA pass</p>
<p>Under Labour, good intentions, rather than good science, are enough to get a pass in NCEA science, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>“Students studying chemistry can design unworkable science experiments and still achieve Level 1 NCEA chemistry.</p>
<p>“A Moderation Report for Chemistry, which is provided by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority to guide marking, bizarrely says, ‘It is only for merit that the plan needs to be feasible.’</p>
<p>“The upshot is that teachers are now being asked to give an achieved grade to a girl or boy who designs an experiment that is not even feasible. That is, it would not work.</p>
<p>“This is a nonsense. We are talking about science here, not a creative dance class. If the experiment doesn’t work, then the experiment fails. In fact, it could be dangerous in some cases.</p>
<p>“Imagine if Ernest Rutherford had applied this ‘doesn’t matter if the experiment works or not’ policy to his scientific endeavours.</p>
<p>“The school teacher who provided this information is a science teacher rightly appalled that chemistry could be dumbed down in such a way.</p>
<p>“While protecting his identity for fear of repercussions he said, ‘this is loopy. We are trying to teach good science. What sort of message does this send?’</p>
<p>“Education Minister Steve Maharey has been told time and time again about NCEA’s issues with encouraging mediocrity. This is another glaring example&quot;.</p>
