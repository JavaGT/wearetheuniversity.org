<p>News Worthy</p>
<p>20 April 2007 - No. 106</p>
<p>A coherent economic agenda</p>
<p>The Government waxes eloquently on its plan of &quot;economic transformation&quot;. That phrase in New Zealand political terms has its origin in comments by the Prime Minister at the start of the present Parliamentary term.</p>
<p>On Wednesday &quot;the Independent Financial Review&quot; published comment to the effect that business was in despair of the inability of both major parties to provide the policies needed to deliver to New Zealand a coherent economic agenda.</p>
<p>Not so for National. A very substantial programme is underway to present to the public an agenda for economic development that will produce significant measurable gains.</p>
<p>Simply by way of example in the last five days the Caucus Economic Development Team has been to the following places:</p>
<p>* Auckland<br>* Napier<br>* Hamilton<br>* Wellington<br>* Christchurch</p>
<p>Those visits have focused on Economic Development agencies, successful exporters, regional and territorial authorities, incubators and startups, tertiary institutes and a commercialisation of research seminar.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we await the much leaked budget announcements of 17 May which rather than provide economic transformation will lead to gaming of the system.</p>
<p>NZ Phones Among Most Expensive In OECD</p>
<p>A report just released by the Commerce Commission shows telephone services in New Zealand are among the most expensive in the OECD.</p>
<p>The Commission has used a model developed by the OECD which has a series of standard &quot;consumption baskets&quot; reflecting different telecommunications end-user profiles.</p>

<p>The statistics show that generally New Zealand telephone services are among the top five most expensive in the OECD.</p>
<p>One of the benchmarks established by the Commission shows there were 640,000 broadband connections as at 31 December 2006. Of fixed line broadband connections, Telecom held the lion&#39;s share directly at 76 percent but many of the remaining connections came from Telecom wholesaling the service to another retailer.</p>
<p>Housing New Zealand Lets Tenant Debt Soar</p>
<p>Regional breakdowns of the debts owed by tenants to Housing New Zealand, including money owed for back rent, and money owed for damage and vandalism have just been released.</p>
<p>Nationwide, total debt (back rent and damage) is up from $3.65 million at end of last financial year to $4.37 million today.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a 20% increase in eight months.</p>
<p>In Auckland the total debt is up 8% to $2.5 million, in Christchurch it&#39;s up 15% and in Wellington it&#39;s up by 25% to $760,000.</p>
<p>Fifteen per cent of Housing NZ tenants are in debt to their landlord. Of those 9,514 in debt, 6,311 are on a repayment scheme.</p>
<p>With more than 11,000 families on the waiting list, tenants who deliberately damage taxpayer-owned state houses should not be expected to enjoy the privilege of state housing.</p>
<p>Failed New Year&#39;s resolutions The NZ Institute of Economic Research in its March update published an interesting article on failed New Year&#39;s resolutions.</p>
<p>Included in the article was comment to the effect that in 2006 New Zealanders were surveyed on their favourite New year&#39;s resolution. The survey conducted by research company AC Nielsen found that 37% of New Zealanders were making New Year&#39;s resolutions. Among those making resolutions, 71% planned to exercise more, 49% wanted to achieve a better work/life balance, 29% to spend more time with family.</p>
<p>So exercising more is by far the favourite New Year&#39;s resolution in New Zealand (higher than the global average of 62% and the seventh highest in the world), and gyms are never as full as they are in mid-January. But, as the year progresses, do the good intentions and resolutions last? Dr Carolyn Mills, a US psychologist now working in New Zealand says that exercising more is also among the top failed resolutions.</p>
