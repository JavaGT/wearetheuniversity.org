<p>Simon Power MP<br>National Party Justice &amp; Corrections Spokesman</p>

<p>Bonuses for Corrections staff astounding</p>
<p>National Party Justice &amp; Corrections spokesman Simon Power is questioning how the Government can justify $1.7 million in bonuses for Corrections staff.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a department that the Minister, Damien O&#39;Connor, claims is &#39;on notice&#39; to improve its performance, yet these bonuses tell a different story.&quot;</p>
<p>Figures obtained by Mr Power reveal that in addition to the $1,745,194 paid to staff in the year to 30 May for performance in the 2005/06 year, at least one staff member received an individual payment of $20,520.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a department that over the past 18 months has overseen prison construction budget blowouts, the Graeme Burton debacle, the death of Liam Ashley, staff corruption, riots - the list goes on and on and on.</p>
<p>&quot;Paying some people in that environment a $20,000 bonus is simply astounding, and Damien O&#39;Connor should explain very clearly to taxpayers how this has come about, rather than simply avoid answering the question, as he did in the House today.</p>
<p>&quot;Taxpayers deserve an answer.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Power is concerned that one of the criteria for bonuses was that &#39;all performance competencies have been met&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Surely that&#39;s the least someone should do to keep their job, rather than something that&#39;s considered above and beyond the call of duty.&quot;</p>
<p>He also points to the contrast between Corrections&#39; alleged superior performance and the high staff turnover figures he revealed last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Something isn&#39;t right with a department that loses a quarter of its head office staff but gives thousands in bonuses to the rest.&quot;</p>
