<p>UC ecologist recognised as one of NZ&#39;s top teachers</p>
<p>A University of Canterbury ecology lecturer has been recognised as one of New Zealand&#39;s top tertiary teachers.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Angus McIntosh (Biological Sciences) was one of 10 teachers awarded a Tertiary Teaching Excellence Award during a ceremony held at Parliament last night.</p>
<p>The awards, administered by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority, recognise exceptional teachers who show outstanding commitment to their subject.</p>
<p>Professor McIntosh said he was “a bit overwhelmed” by the award, which included $20,000 in prize money to be used for career development and promote best practice.</p>
<p>“Teaching is your core business as an academic so I feel like I&#39;ve just been doing my job. But it&#39;s nice to be acknowledged and recognised for something that I enjoy doing,” he said.</p>
<p>“Teaching is the main reason why I work at a university rather than in a research facility. The students present a great challenge but also great inspiration and teaching them is enormously rewarding. I can&#39;t think of a better job.”</p>
<p>Professor McIntosh believed his role as a teacher was to inspire students and provide them with the tools to seek knowledge independently.</p>
<p>“One of my philosophies is that we should be concentrating on depth of knowledge rather than breadth of knowledge. We should be providing students with basic, fundamental knowledge so they can go out and seek further information on their own.”</p>
<p>However, while Professor McIntosh believed teaching was an “absolutely fundamental” part of being an academic, he said teaching and research were inseparable.</p>

<p>“I think my research informs my teaching. The fact that I&#39;m generating information helps in my teaching and makes it up to date,” he said.</p>
<p>“Teaching also focuses the mind on what the important questions are and what you should be addressing in your research. A large proportion of good research ideas come from students and we wouldn&#39;t be doing our jobs right if that wasn&#39;t the case. We should be inspiring them to think creatively.”</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Sharp said he was delighted for Professor McIntosh.<br>“Canterbury is a research-led university that places a very high value on teaching excellence and it is people like Professor McIntosh who provide our students with the inspiration to be the best they can be.</p>
<p>“I know everyone at the University will join me in congratulating him on his achievement.”</p>
<p>Professor McIntosh, who last year was awarded a Canterbury University Teaching Award, is currently in Colorado on study leave carrying out research on how variations in flow affect alpine stream communities.</p>
<p>It is the second successive year that a UC lecturer has been awarded a Tertiary Teaching Excellence Award. Last year civil engineering senior lecturer Dr Roger Nokes was recognised.</p>
