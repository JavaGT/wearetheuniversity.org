<p>Kiwi economist invited to US to study health policy</p>
<p>An economist from the Business School at The University of Auckland has received a prestigious fellowship to study US health policy at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>Dr Rhema Vaithianathan of the Department of Economics has been awarded a Harkness Fellowship from the Commonwealth Fund of New York.</p>
<p>She will spend 10 months working on a major piece of health policy research at the Boston-based university.</p>
<p>New Zealanders receive only one or two of these scholarships each year. Dr Vaithianathan is the first New Zealand economist to receive one.</p>
<p>Dr Vaithianathan will work on a project analysing US health insurance. She will look at how health insurance can be made more affordable while delivering maximum health benefits.</p>
<p>“Many people in the US are not insured, which means they are denied access to a great deal of medical care. There are multiple insurers operating in a complex system in the US, which leaves scope to find better ways of delivering insurance that brings the most benefit for the least amount of money,” she says.</p>
<p>Dr Vaithianathan will also impart lessons to the US on New Zealand’s approach to health policy.</p>
<p>Dr Vaithianathan has a research background in health economics, health policy and the economics of the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
