<p>Massey staff receive national awards for teaching excellence</p>
<p>Two Massey staff were last night named as winners of tertiary teaching excellence awards of $20,000 each. It is the second year running that Massey has had two of the 10 winners.</p>
<p>Dr Tracy Riley, from the School of Curriculum and Pedagogy in the College of Education, is a specialist in teaching gifted children and teaching teachers of gifted children. Dr Bryan Walpert, from the School of English and Media Studies in the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, teaches creative writing and specialises in poetry.</p>
<p>Tertiary Education Minister Dr Michael Cullen presented the awards at a function at the Beehive. Dr Cullen, the Acting Prime Minister and Finance Minister, recalled his life before politics as a university lecturer at Otago, saying good teachers wanted to leave students feeling inspired.</p>
<p>“Teaching has a special intrinsic reward in giving knowledge and inspiration to students: in knowing that you led someone to see something and develop their own capacity. And, of course, one doesn&#39;t get to become a teacher at tertiary level without both experiencing some excellent teaching and being the victim of teaching that isn&#39;t.”</p>
<p>Teaching had always been important, Dr Cullen said. “But skills and knowledge are becoming more and more important, as the foundation of our modern economy. Therefore excellence in teaching is becoming more valuable. And as our future unfolds, the quality and excellence of our education system will need to meet the demands of a higher skill and knowledge-based society.</p>

<p>“When we recognise excellence in teaching through these awards we are doing much more than motivating teachers to reach a special standard. Our celebration is also a way of inspiring others with recognition of what it takes to achieve excellence.</p>
<p>“Tertiary teachers have twin responsibilities - teaching and research. Both are essential functions. These awards were introduced with a conscious intention to focus on teaching as an art by itself and to recognise excellence.”</p>
<p>Pro Vice-Chancellor for the College of Education Professor James Chapman, who attended the function on behalf of the Vice-Chancellor Professor Judith Kinnear, congratulated Dr Riley and Dr Walpert, saying it was recognition of their outstanding contribution to teaching at the University.</p>
<p>“It reinforces the value that Massey places on teaching and it is good to see that being recognised at a national level,” Professor Chapman said.</p>
<p>“I think there are many others who are demonstrating similar outstanding skills and this is just the tip of the iceberg really.”</p>
<p>Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Ian Warrington also paid tribute to the Massey winners.</p>
<p>&quot;These national awards recognise exceptional teachers who show outstanding commitment to their subject and demonstrate knowledge, enthusiasm and a special ability to stimulate learners&#39; thinking and interest,” Professor Warrington said. “We should all be delighted that, again this year, academic staff of Massey University have been recognised as premier teachers. We are indeed fortunate to have such high calibre performers on our staff and to have them rewarded in this way. I extend warmest congratulations to you both on behalf of all of your colleagues in the University.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Riley has been at Massey for 11 years. She has a PhD in special education, with an emphasis on gifted and talented education, from the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg.</p>
<p>Dr Walpert has been at Massey for three years. The former United States magazine and newspaper journalist, has a PhD in English from the University of Denver, Colorado.</p>
<p>The other award recipients were Margo Barton from Otago Polytechnic, Donna Buckingham and Associate Professor Katharine Dickinson from Otago University, Dr Christine Rubie-Davies from Auckland University, Dr Diane Johnson from Waikato University, Associate Professor Angus McIntosh from Canterbury University, and Peter Mellow from Auckland University of Technology.</p>
<p>Each receives $20,000, which may be used for professional development.</p>
<p>Selena Chan from Christchurch Polytechnic received the Prime Minister’s Supreme Tertiary Teaching Excellence Award worth $30,000. Ms Chan is a Massey alumna, having received a Masters in Educational Administration in 2002.</p>
