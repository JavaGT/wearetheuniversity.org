<p>Correspondence School’s performance slides</p>
<p>Labour’s tinkering with The Correspondence School has led to a slide in its performance, which has been highlighted in the latest Education Review Office (ERO) report, says National’s Associate Education spokesman, Colin King.</p>
<p>“The Differentiated Service Model (DSM) introduced by Trevor Mallard 18 months ago has done nothing to lift performance and has, in fact, seen quality slide.</p>
<p>“The ERO report was concerning enough that they are returning to do another review in two years, rather than the standard three years. And the school itself will conduct a review on how the DSM is working at the end of this year.</p>
<p>“Since Labour’s reforms of almost two years ago, things have only got worse. The ERO report prior to Labour’s fiddling was much better than the one released this week.”</p>
<p>Some of the concerns raised by ERO include:</p>
<p>- ‘Significant proportions of students enrolled in the programmes during the course of the year do not submit required work or complete final assessment’.</p>
<p>- ‘Programmes and resources for delivery of the technology curriculum in Year 7 and Year 8 are outdated’.</p>
<p>- ‘Examples of lack of responsiveness to students’ interests, needs and circumstances, and changes to pedagogical thinking and practise, are of particular concern&#39;.</p>
<p>- ‘Considerable inconsistencies are evident in completion, quality and rigour of the teacher appraisal process’.</p>
<p>“This report on teaching quality at The Correspondence School does nothing to encourage confidence.</p>
<p>“By meddling with this iconic New Zealand system, Labour has put at risk a high-quality distance learning model that is the only option for 600 young, rural students.”</p>
