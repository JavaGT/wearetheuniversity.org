<p>Remittances key to local development says Fiji academic</p>
<p>Remittances from overseas now account for around 15% of Fiji&#39;s total household income, creating an important seed capital resource for local entrepreneurs to call upon, says a senior academic from the University of the South Pacific.</p>
<p>Dr Eci Nabalarua, Pro Vice-Chancellor Academic at USP, told a conference in Port Vila, Vanuatu, that overseas remittances now amount to more than $300 million Fiji dollars, outstripping the combined revenues from tourism and sugar.</p>
<p>&quot;The bulk of this money is accruing to Fijian households,&quot; said Dr Nabalarua. &quot;In addition, there&#39;s an emerging trend for greater economic self-sufficiency at the provincial level, with the creation of investment portfolios which can act as a source of financial capital and credit for small businesses. So there&#39;s no shortage of capital for local entrepreneurial development.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Nabalarua was speaking on development and entrepreneurship in Fiji at the first conference of the Asia Pacific Academy of Business in Society (APABIS).</p>
<p>Jointly organised by the University of Waikato Management School and the University of the South Pacific, the conference is focusing on communities and sustainable development.</p>
<p>Dr Nabalarua pointed out that much Fijian business activity exists in the informal economy, and is strongly rooted in the traditional values of family and community structures.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not enough to cut and paste Western business templates - it just doesn&#39;t work,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Dr Nabalarua said holistic, sustainable development was fundamental to the Fijian world view, and money was not the primary motivating factor. &quot;What matters is that the benefit returns to the whole community, in which individuals understand and know their place and space.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Juliet Roper of Waikato Management School, who founded APABIS with the endorsement of the European Academy of Business in Society, says there&#39;s growing evidence that successful business is based on a full and constructive engagement with the welfare of the communities it serves.</p>
<p>&quot;APABIS aims to create a network of research and practice in sustainable business development across the Asia-Pacific region, and we hope this conference will aid that process,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The APABIS conference continues until 27 June.</p>
