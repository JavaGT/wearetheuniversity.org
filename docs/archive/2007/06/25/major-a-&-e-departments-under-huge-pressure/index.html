<p><strong>Monday, 25 June 2007, 8:28 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Major A &amp; E departments under huge pressure</p>
<p>“More and more patients languish on trolleys in hospital corridors, because New Zealand&#39;s major hospital emergency departments are still failing to see emergency patients soon enough,” says National Party Health spokesman Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>And National is warning that emergency patients will wait even longer if GPs stop providing after-hours care.</p>
<p>The latest information for the three months ending March 2007, shows that no major DHB in New Zealand is meeting all three of the Government&#39;s waiting time benchmarks for treating patients at emergency departments. These benchmarks are recommended by the Australasian College of Emergency Medicine.</p>
<p>“Just four small DHBs met all three benchmarks for emergency treatment times. They were Tairawhiti, Lakes, Wairarapa and South Canterbury – all DHBs located in smaller cities and towns.</p>
<p>“Many hospitals struggle to even see patients with immediate or imminent threat to ‘life or limb’ (*1). How bad is that? Despite the huge amount of extra money being poured into the health system, it obviously isn&#39;t getting to where it’s needed.</p>
<p>“How long you wait in a hospital emergency department has a direct bearing on how well any treatment will work (*2). Sadly, everyone knows someone who has waited hours and hours to be seen at an ED. Yet the Government waits for more reports and keeps giving excuses.”</p>
<p>Mr Ryall says the data he is releasing today does not include less serious patients whose waiting time in emergency departments is not recorded (*3).</p>

<p>&quot;Health Minister Pete Hodgson could fix delays in emergency care by improving after-hours GP care and using innovative approaches like putting GP clinics in some emergency departments.</p>
<p>“The Minister should not be allowed to walk away from this one. How would he like to be forced to lie on a hospital stretcher in a corridor for a couple of days?</p>
<p>“With GPs threatening to withdraw from after-hours care in some parts of the country, this would put even greater pressure on A&amp;E departments.</p>
<p>“Too much energy, money and time is being spent on Labour covering its tracks, and not enough is finding its way to the frontline,” says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>Footnotes:<br>*1 - Triage 2<br>*2 - Ministry of Health, Health and Independence Report 2006.<br>*3 - Triage 1: Immediate: these patients tend to have an immediate threat to life and limb, such as immediate risk to airway breathing or circulation or are deeply unconscious.</p>
<p>Triage 2: 10 minutes: These patients tend to have potential or imminent threat to life or limb. For example serious head injury, moderately severe trauma, suspected heart attack.</p>
<p>Traige 3: 30 minutes: these patients tend to have conditions which need urgent management or are associated with significant systems. For example fractures, breathlessness, bleeding.</p>
