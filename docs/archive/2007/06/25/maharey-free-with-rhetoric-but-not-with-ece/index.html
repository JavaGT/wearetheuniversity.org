<p>Maharey Free With Rhetoric, But Not With ECE</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Heather Roy today congratulated Education Minister Steve Maharey for pulling off, what may be, the biggest scam in New Zealand&#39;s history of Early Childhood Education.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey has even managed to pull the wool over the eyes of the charitable trusts that provide funding to the Auckland Kindergarten Association - so well, in fact, that these trusts are now either opting out or threatening to opt out of the arrangement,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;This means the AKA is at risk of losing $1.1 million of funding a year - and will have to charge parents an additional 50 cents per hour per child to provide 20 hours free Early Childhood Education for three and four-year-olds.</p>
<p>&quot;So much for Mr Maharey&#39;s statement that: &#39;from July 1 tens of thousands of New Zealand parents will have more money in their hands every week&#39; - or perhaps he simply wasn&#39;t including Auckland parents in that statement.</p>
<p>&quot;A group of concerned parents - &#39;20 Hours Free. Please&#39; - has delivered a petition to Parliament urging the Minister to keep his election promise that &#39;20 hours free education will be provided for three and four-year-olds at any licensed teacher-led service in New Zealand from July 2007&#39;. Around the nation, 3,375 people have signed this petition.</p>
<p>&quot;This just goes to show: Mr Maharey can fool some of the people some of the time, but he can&#39;t fool all of the people all of the time.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey has put Early Childhood Centres in an untenable situation, stuck between parents on one side and the Government on the other - and unable to make either one happy.</p>
<p>&quot;With ECCs facing a tough enough time as it is, the least Mr Maharey could do is come clean and admit that his interpretation of the term &#39;free&#39; is different to that of the rest of the English-speaking world - then, perhaps, the AKA might be able to retain some of the funding they so desperately need to provide quality education,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
