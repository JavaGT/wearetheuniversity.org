<p>VUWSA Walks the Talk for the Climate, Ahead of the Rest</p>
<p>Wellington 18 June 2007</p>
<p>In an effort to help curb the effects of climate change, VUWSA, Victoria University’s of Wellington Students’ Association have offset their greenhouse gas emission through the Landcare Research carboNZero programme during the New Zealand Union of Students’ Association (NZUSA) June 07 conference, hosted this year by Lincoln University Students’ Association.</p>
<p>This move was made to show other students’ associations that it is possible to be both environmental and financially responsible. “VUWSA has shown that reducing our association carbon footprint has not cost us the earth.” Said Tushara Kodikara, VUWSA’s environmental officer. The total cost of offsetting the entire conference, which includes flights to Christchurch, and a road trip to Lincoln, was only $38.50 for the ten executive members of VUWSA.</p>
<p>This expense was seen as minimal compared to the affects that climate change will have on students in the next few decades. VUWSA has once again shown leadership in issues that matter most to students. “Negative effects of climate change will affect the poor the most, and this will include students” said Tai Neilson, the VUWSA campaigns officer. VUWSA believes that other students’ associations’ should follow suit, and take steps in reducing their carbon footprint.</p>
<p>Student associations have always led the way in challenging societal issues, and climate change will be the greatest issue to challenge society this century. “It is time for students to rise up and walk the talk when it comes to climate change” said Tushara.</p>
