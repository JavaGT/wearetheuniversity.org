<p>Maori welcome Nats trades training policy</p>
<p>Maori will be among the big winners from National&#39;s trades training policy, says National Party Maori Affairs spokesman, Tau Henare.</p>
<p>National Leader John Key announced the policy this week, which will include introducing school-based apprenticeships, addressing the technology teacher shortage by allowing qualified tradespeople to teach, raising the esteem in which trades training is held and encouraging off-site trades training.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a huge indictment on the education system under Labour that a horrifying 53% of Maori boys leave school without even achieving NCEA Level One. These youngsters need better choices.</p>
<p>&quot;While many Maori excel academically and become leaders in their fields, others need practical, hands-on learning to keep their interest up at school.</p>
<p>&quot;This will give young Maori the chance to make school meaningful. Geometry becomes a lot more interesting if a student can see the practical application of it in a trade like building.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s policy is a hugely important one for young people who currently truant through the system in order to endure it.</p>
<p>&quot;The Labour Government&#39;s policies see more than half of all Maori boys leaving school without the most basic qualification and running the risk of ending up as just another negative statistic - without even the basic reading and writing skills to start an apprenticeship.</p>
<p>&quot;Bringing hands-on, practical skills back into the school curriculum will be a saviour for these students, and the trades training they complete will address the huge shortage of skilled workers that employers are crying out for.</p>
<p>&quot;Maori, no matter what their politics, should be welcoming National&#39;s trades training policy with open arms.&quot;</p>
