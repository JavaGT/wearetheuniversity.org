<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>19 June 2007</p>
<p>$1 million donation to take Antarctic research further</p>
<p>A donation of $1million to the University&#39;s Antarctic Research Centre by a Victoria alumnus will strengthen its research into the history and behaviour of the Antarctic ice sheet in the face of global warming.</p>
<p>The generosity of Alan Eggers, a member of the University&#39;s 1975 Antarctic Expedition, is a significant boost for the Centre&#39;s research on the ice, says Centre Director Professor Peter Barrett.</p>
<p>&quot;This remarkable donation comes at a time when the need to know more about the region&#39;s climate history is more important than ever before,&quot; Professor Barrett says.</p>
<p>A Victoria geology graduate, Mr Eggers says he is delighted to be able to &quot;give something back&quot; to the University for his time on the ice. He acknowledges the Centre’s research achievements over the last 50 years and wants to support its current program on account of its global relevance and importance. He also wants to support ongoing student participation in Antarctic research.</p>
<p>&quot;The Centre is recognised as a world leader in this field of research and both the Centre and its researchers are positioned to make a major contribution to our knowledge on climate change,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Mr Eggers notes increasing concern from both scientists and the community regarding the response of the Antarctic to climate change, and thinks more funding is required in this area to better understand the impacts and possible outcomes of continued carbon emissions on climate change.</p>

<p>The donation will be invested through the Victoria University Foundation, and divided among three main areas:</p>
<p>- The Centre&#39;s Endowed Development Fund to support young Antarctic scientists.</p>
<p>- The Centre&#39;s work in the development of Antarctic drilling technology.</p>
<p>- The Centre&#39;s scientific capability in the area of ice and climate modelling.</p>
<p>Mr Eggers will visit the University&#39;s Kelburn campus in the near future to meet with former lecturers and to be formally acknowledged by the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh.</p>
<p>He is also making a grant to the University of Tasmania’s Antarctic Research Centre in Hobart to support complimentary research by their team in the Antarctic.</p>
