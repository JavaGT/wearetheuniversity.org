<p>Katherine Rich MP<br>National Party Education Spokeswoman</p>

<p>Class size policy - slip sliding away</p>
<p>While the Education Minister continues to pretend there has been no shift in Labour&#39;s policy on class sizes for new entrants, official information documents released by National clearly show the opposite, says National&#39;s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;The papers show Steve Maharey deliberately attempted to distract the education sector&#39;s attention from Labour&#39;s promise of restricting junior classes to 15 kids.</p>
<p>&quot;In the 2005 election, Labour made the clear promise that it would &#39;employ around 1,300 extra primary teachers in Year 1 classes over the next three years to ensure that by 2008 there are no more than 15 students in a class.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister, hoping no one would notice, then announced in the Budget that the ratio would be 1:18 by the second term in 2008.</p>
<p>&quot;How the Minister could stand during Parliament&#39;s question time and pretend that the dilution of his policy was not a broken promise beggars belief. The facts are so clear.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister gave categorical assurances to Parliament that there has been no change in Labour&#39;s policy when copies of the Minister&#39;s work programme prove the opposite is correct.&quot;</p>
<p>Official documents state that by mid-2007, in time for budget 2007, the Minister aimed to &#39;reposition&#39; the issue as smaller class sizes in the junior school, rather than a fixed ratio and &#39;to use speeches to talk about smaller class sizes rather than just 1:15 ratio&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;The document also notes the Minister did this through an &#39;NZEI speech and questions&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister can&#39;t honestly expect the sector to believe that he has not broken another election promise when documents clearly prove otherwise. If there had not been a change, why take time to &#39;reposition&#39; the issue and release a totally different ratio in the Budget? &quot;</p>
