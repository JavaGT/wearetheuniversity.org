<p><strong>Tuesday, 12 June 2007, 2:06 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Who will crew the Navy’s new ships?</p>
<p>Will the New Zealand Navy have enough key personnel to operate its seven new Project Protector ships, the first of which is being commissioned today?</p>
<p>That’s the question being asked by National’s Defence spokesman, Dr Wayne Mapp.</p>
<p>“The commissioning of HMNZS Canterbury is a significant milestone that should be celebrated. However, there are concerns about the Navy’s ability to operate the new ships.”</p>
<p>The director of Victoria University’s Centre for Strategic Studies, Peter Cozens, told the international publication Defence News, that ‘The biggest problem they have is sufficient experienced and competent technical staff at the middle-management level; there is a real shortage of these people’.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the Navy’s official publication reported the Chief of Navy saying the service is in a ‘very delicate position’ with only a few people being the difference between a ship sailing or not.</p>
<p>“It’s all very well having seven new ships, but if there are not enough people to crew them they will be left idle at the wharf,” says Dr Mapp.</p>
<p>“Our Navy is already struggling to properly crew its existing fleet – how will it operate its seven new vessels?</p>
<p>“Recruitment and retention is the most critical issue facing the Defence Force, and the Government needs to be making this its highest priority in defence.”</p>
