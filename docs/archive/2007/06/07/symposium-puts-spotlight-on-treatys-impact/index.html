<p>Symposium puts spotlight on Treaty’s impact</p>
<p>The Treaty of Waitangi’s impact on New Zealand law and society will be explored at a high-powered national symposium at the University of Otago later this month.</p>
<p>The one-day symposium marks the 20th anniversary of a pivotal Court of Appeal ruling that interpreted the “principles of the Treaty” for the first time.</p>
<p>Otago Senior Law Lecturer Jacinta Ruru says the 29 June gathering brings together high-profile figures involved in the original case and subsequent Treaty-related legal developments.</p>
<p>Minister of Justice Hon Mark Burton, Sir Tipene O’Regan, Sir Ivor Richardson and Chief Judge Joe Williams are among the symposium line-up.</p>
<p>Other confirmed speakers include Professor Emeritus Jock Brookfield, Moana Jackson, Sir Maurice Casey, Linda Te Aho, Judge Carrie Wainwright, Professor Alex Frame and Kensington Swan’s Maori Legal Services team.</p>
<p>“The New Zealand Maori Council v. Attorney-General case resulted in a unanimous landmark decision interpreting the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi,” says Ms Ruru, who is the principal organiser of the Symposium.</p>
<p>“With these principles now incorporated into many aspects of law, it is timely to reflect on the case’s significance and its impact on our legal system and wider society.”</p>
<p>Legal recognition of the principles of the Treaty has influenced relationships between the Crown and iwi and hapu, impacting on all areas of law and society, she says.</p>
<p>“For instance, important new relationships have developed in areas such as the environment, family, health, broadcasting and education,” she says.</p>

<p>Among those registered to attend so far are judges, several MPs, academics, law practitioners and hapu representatives from throughout the country, as well as representatives from government departments and independent think tanks.</p>
<p>“This is a must-attend event for anyone interested in the role of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi in law and society,” says Ms Ruru.</p>
<p>The “In Good Faith” symposium is being hosted by the University of Otago’s Faculty of Law with support from the New Zealand Law Foundation.</p>
