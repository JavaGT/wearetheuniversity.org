<p>Otago gains major health research funding</p>
<p>University of Otago researchers gained $28.6m in the latest Health Research Council (HRC) funding for research projects to improve the health of New Zealanders.</p>
<p>The 20 contracts won by Otago researchers include two of the three new major research programmes announced in the annual nationwide round. Overall, they gained 50.3 per cent of the available funding.</p>
<p>One new programme focuses on preventing injuries and reducing subsequent disability, and the other involves combating deadly viruses, such as HIV, and exploiting viruses to improve vaccines and therapies for other diseases. The researchers leading this programme are members of the University’s Webster Centre for Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>University researchers also gained extensions to five existing major programmes. These involve long-term mental health and wellbeing, mental health treatment, new ways to detect and treat cancer, lifestyle approaches to obesity and diabetes, and investigating hyperactivity and movement disorders.</p>
<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) Professor Geoff White says the researchers achieved an outstanding result in a very competitive funding round.</p>
<p>“The fact that our researchers won more than twice the amount of any other institution confirms that the University of Otago is the major centre for excellence in health research,” he says.</p>
<p>“I warmly congratulate them on their well-earned success. As well as gaining more than half of the available funding, they have also won the highest number of contracts.</p>

<p>“Throughout the country, only one-quarter of new programme applications and less than one-fifth of project applications were successful. Otago’s much higher rate of success testifies to the high calibre and relevance of the Otago research proposals.</p>
<p>“Our researchers’ stellar performance clearly reinforces Otago’s recognised status as both New Zealand’s most research-intensive university, and the one with the highest-quality research,” says Professor White.</p>
<p>Researchers from Otago Divisions of Health Sciences and Sciences at all three campuses in Dunedin, Christchurch, and Wellington were successful in the round.</p>
<p>As well as the seven research programmes funded, University researchers will also pursue 10 new projects. Two grants for emerging researchers and one for a feasibility study were also gained.</p>
<p>“All these new Otago initiatives hold the potential to bring practical benefits that can make a real difference to the health and well-being of New Zealanders across many areas,” he says.</p>
<p>The projects include investigating genes involved in arthritis and schizophrenia, cellular mechanisms underlying neurological diseases and fertility, a new marker for acute cardiac injury, and lowering the rate of colorectal cancer in New Zealand.</p>
