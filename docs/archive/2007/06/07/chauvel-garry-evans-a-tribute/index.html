<p>Garry Evans: A Tribute</p>
<p>7 June 2007</p>
<p>Charles Chauvel, lawyer and Labour List MP Resident in Wellington, has paid tribute to Mr Garry Evans for his 10 years’ of service as Coroner for Wellington.</p>
<p>“Garry Evans is an exemplary Wellingtonian who has rendered great public service to this City”, said Chauvel. “I came to know him when I was practising law as a partner in my old law firm of Minter Ellison. When I was first a partner there in 1999, Garry had already been a partner in his firm of O’Regan, Arndt Peters and Evans for some 30 years. He was, and is, extraordinarily well-liked and well-respected by lawyers and others in this City for his achievements and his service on law society committees, voluntary bodies, and of course for his work as Coroner in Wellington since his appointment to that role in 1997”.</p>
<p>Mr Evans is a graduate of Horowhenua College and Victoria University (LLB, 1965). He is a long-time Wadestown resident. Outside of his distinguished legal career, his roles have included:</p>
<p>- Art critic for the Evening Post;</p>
<p>- Book reviewer for The Listener;</p>
<p>- Vice President of the Wellington Men’s Hockey Umpires’ Assn;</p>
<p>- Member of the Thorndon School Committee;</p>
<p>- Annual Appeals Organiser for the NZ Crippled Children Society (CCS) and the Save the Children Fund (SCF) in Thorndon and Wadestown and for the Royal NZ Foundation for the Blind (RNZFB) in the Highland Park area, as well as serving as the honorary solicitor for SCF.</p>
<p>In the law, Mr Evans is very highly regarded for his expertise in employment law, medico-legal matters and administrative law.</p>
<p>“I know that he will continue to render well-regarded public service in the other roles he holds, which currently include:</p>
<p>- Independent Advisor to the Accident Compensation Corporation concerning claims for treatment injury;</p>
<p>- Ministerial appointee to the Maritime Appeal Authority under s82 Maritime Transport Act 1994”.</p>
