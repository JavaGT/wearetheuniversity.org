<p>BZP ban right decision on balance</p>
<p>The Government’s decision to move to ban benzylpiperazine (BZP), the active ingredient in most so-called “party pills” was a tough call but, on balance, probably the right decision, says Dr Chris Wilkins from Massey’s Centre for Social and Health Outcomes (SHORE).</p>
<p>Dr Wilkins led a major study by SHORE researchers of legal party pill use in New Zealand, which was published last year and cited by both proponents and opponents of a ban to back their arguments.</p>
<p>The study identified levels and patterns of use and demographics of users, their use of other drugs, any harm or problems associated with use. It also gauged availability and measured levels of dependency.</p>
<p>A random survey of 2010 people aged 13 to 45 years was conducted in February and March last year, which found that one in five had tried legal party pills and two in five (40 per cent) of 18 to 29-year-olds. Men were more likely to have tried them than women (24 per cent, compared with 17 per cent) and Mäori were more likely to have tried them than non-Mäori (26 per cent compared with 19 per cent).</p>
<p>Dr Wilkins was surprised at the numbers of people who had tried party pills, saying earlier that initial estimates were a figure closer to 5 per cent than 20 per cent.</p>
<p>“Our survey indicated that party pills were the fourth most widely used drug in New Zealand after alcohol, tobacco and cannabis. That was unheard of in any other country.”</p>
<p>While most users reported fairly minor problems, a small number of users had experienced serious problems and had been admitted to hospital intensive care units with potentially life-threatening conditions.</p>

<p>“There has been no research on the long-term effects of BZP or the role BZP may play in psychological illness. Consequently, there was a strong case for stricter regulation of the use and sale of party pills and on balance a ban appears to be the low- risk decision. It will be interesting to see if a black market develops and the extent to which the authorities can control any criminal trade that develops.”</p>
