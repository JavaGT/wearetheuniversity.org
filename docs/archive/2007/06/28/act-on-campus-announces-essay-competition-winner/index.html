<h3>ACT On Campus Announces Essay Competition Winner</h3>
<p>ACT On Campus today announced that Tauranga Boys College student Cameron Loughlin has been selected as the winner of its inaugural &#39;Liberal Thinking&#39; essay competition.</p>
<p>Cameron wrote about how high taxation harms the economy as well as individuals. He will receive an all expenses paid trip to Parliament where he will spend a day with ACT Leader Rodney Hide.</p>
<p>Rodney said, &quot;It is great to see that so many young people are taking an increasingly active role in New Zealand politics. I am looking forward to meeting, and sharing views and perspectives with Cameron.&quot;</p>
<p>The &#39;Liberal Thinking&#39; essay competition received around 70 entries from students across New Zealand. Runner up was Gaylene Hill who will receive an Ipod Nano for her efforts.</p>
<p>The final decision was made by John Ansell; a Wellington based freelance writer, professional speaker and advertiser. John can also lay claim to being the first to dub Wellington&#39;s stadium the &#39;cake tin&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;The &#39;Liberal Thinking&#39; competition has been a great opportunity for young people to have their say on the political process that affects them&quot; said ACT On Campus President Mike Bridge. &quot;Politics should be accessible to all young people.&quot;</p>
