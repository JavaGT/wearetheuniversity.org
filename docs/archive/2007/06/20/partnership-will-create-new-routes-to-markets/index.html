<p>Partnership Will Create New Routes To Indian Markets</p>
<p>Massey University Graduate School of Business (GSB) and the Massey e-Centre today announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding for two partnerships with India-based CMC Limited, formerly IBM in India.</p>
<p>The e-Centre partnership is designed to create new routes to Indian and international markets for IT startups, while the Massey GSB partnership will create a range of management education opportunities in New Zealand and India.</p>
<p>CMC is the leading education provider in IT in India, with 250 plus training centres. Whereas many IT companies focus on the international market, CMC is domestic-focused.</p>
<p>R Ramanan, Managing Director and CEO of CMC said, &quot;I see enormous potential with this venture. India has no scarcity of people or good talent coming out of our universities, but there is a gap in managerial capability and exposure to advanced markets and product innovation.&quot;</p>
<p>The e-Centre partnership initiative is a joint venture centred on exporting innovative technology solutions developed in New Zealand to a global market, which will be facilitated by CMC.</p>
<p>Explains Ramanan, &quot;The Business Model will entail the e-Centre conducting evaluations of up and coming New Zealand technology companies that are looking to go global. Candidates that are accepted will receive the support of CMC to bring them to the global market.&quot;</p>
<p>Twenty companies are currently being evaluated, some of which are in commercial negotiations with companies in India, which are being facilitated by CMC.</p>

<p>The CMC relationship is intended to open up a new route to market for IT start-up companies, as well as more mature companies</p>
<p>The Massey GSB and CMC partnership will involve a number of training and educational offerings in both India and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Ramanan says that rapid growth in the Indian economy on all fronts is driving the need for business education.</p>
<p>&quot;Universities and Colleges in India do not have access to world class business programmes. In addition, global companies are setting up base in India and demand that the managerial capability they have elsewhere in the world is comparable in their Indian offices.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramanan believes this tremendous demand for management capability can be addressed by the CMC / Massey GSB partnership, saying &quot;Massey can help us bring world class capability to this area.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Companies in India are interested in building the soft skills of their people, such as communication, teamwork, project management, financial management and risk management. People need these skills to work in a globally competitive environment. They need training on what it means to participate in a global economy and work for a global company,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>The partnership with Massey GSB will be a very flexible model, but may include short course executive education to the Indian market. Partners are also exploring the possibility of running the Massey MBA Executive 2 year programme in India.</p>
<p>Ramanan also says that Indian MBA students may work in internships with the e-centre start up companies, creating a merging of the two partnerships.</p>
<p>&quot;This could give the young companies insight in to market conditions in India and help to bridge cultural issues in everything from product design to sales processes.&quot;</p>
<p>CMC is a 51% owned subsidiary of TCS, which has $4 billion annual revenue and 87,000 employees. CMC was acquired by TCS in 2001, at which time it was the leading IT solutions provider to government in India.</p>
