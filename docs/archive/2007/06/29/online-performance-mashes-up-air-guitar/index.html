<p>Friday, June 29, 2007<br>Online performance mashes up air guitar</p>
<p>A live audiovisual mash up of guitar anthems and YouTube footage of air guitarists will feature alongside online performances created by artists from all over the world, in a festival to mark a unique date.</p>
<p>On the seventh day of the seventh month of 2007 diverse performances will unfold in front of live and online audiences.</p>
<p>People anywhere in the world can participate in performances by going to <a href="http://www.upstage.org.nz">www.upstage.org.nz</a> without having to download and install any additional software.</p>
<p>The performances are part of the 070707 festival, which runs alongside the Wellington-based Film Archive’s exhibition From Puppets to Pixels – an interactive show for children of all ages.</p>
<p>Performances include shadow puppets, unique takes on classic theatre works by Samuel Beckett, contemporary dance, a site-specific work at a London building site and an audiovisual mash up.</p>
<p>The Best Air Guitar Album in the World Vol. II, is devised and performed by Anaesthesia Associates (<a href="http://www.anaesthesiaassociates.net">www.anaesthesiaassociates.net</a>), a band consisting of Paul Bradley and Dan Agnihotri-Clark, a doctoral candidate in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington. Mr Agnihotri-Clark is a visual artist, musician and curator whose work explores the intersection between art and technology.</p>
<p>He says he chose air guitar because it’s a lot of fun, but also because being online is ultimately about connecting to the world around you.</p>
<p>“The idea of an air guitar hero provided an exaggeration of the desire to connect with other people and to perform for them.”</p>
<p>Anaesthesia Associates will manipulate audio samples from the CD compilation, The Best Air Guitar Album in the World Vol. II, mixing these with video samples of the world&#39;s best air guitarists found on YouTube.</p>
<p>Their 21-minute show starts at 11pm on 07/07/07, live at the Film Archive and online at <a href="http://www.upstage.org.nz">www.upstage.org.nz</a>.</p>
