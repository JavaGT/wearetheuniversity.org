<h3>Education Is The Key To Life&#39;s Opportunities</h3>
<p>Last night, I held a public meeting on education at Takapuna Grammar School.  We heard speeches from Simon Lamb, Principal of Takapuna Grammar; David Hodge, Principal of Rangitoto College; and Katherine Rich, National&#39;s Education Spokeswoman.</p>
<p><strong>Challenging Our Thinking</strong></p>
<p>The two principals challenged our thinking.  Both of them are leading New Zealand school principals.  They head two of the top schools in the country.  They are at the forefront of educational thinking.  They had common themes:</p>
<p>* Education is about opportunity</p>
<p>* Young people should be challenged</p>
<p>* Schools should broaden young people&#39;s horizons</p>
<p>* Principals and schools need the Ministry to get out of the way</p>
<p>* We need to value teaching professionals</p>
<p>A clear message came through - educational bureaucracy stands in the way of educational excellence.</p>
<p><strong>Freedom under National</strong></p>
<p>National has the opportunity to act on these messages.  They are in sync with our values.  Katherine Rich emphasised the importance of giving schools freedom, and extending opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Trades in Schools</strong></p>
<p>National is determined to give every child the best shot at life&#39;s opportunities.  That is why we have announced &quot;Trades and Industry Training in Schools&quot;.  We want to ensure that students who currently do not see school as relevant, have the opportunity to get real advantages from their schooling.</p>

<p><strong>Industry Partnerships</strong></p>
<p>We will build a partnership with industry.  We will allow young people to actually start an apprenticeship at school.  We will make it easier for highly skilled tradespeople to become teachers.</p>
<p>From my experiences as a law professor at Auckland University, I know how liberating education can be.  For most New Zealanders, it is the platform for life&#39;s successes.  We need to give every child a real chance at life&#39;s opportunities. </p>
