<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>29 June 2007</p>
<p>Architecture competition a winner</p>
<p>A competition run by the Department of Conservation (DoC) in association with Victoria University&#39;s School of Design has proved to be a winner for all involved.</p>
<p>Victoria third-year architecture student Peter Mora&#39;s concept for a new shelter at the McKinnon Pass in Fiordland National Park will be developed, following DoC organising a competition among Victoria design students to replace the cold, damp existing shelter.</p>
<p>The Department had made replacing the shelter a priority for 2007, due to extensive renovations required. The decision to replace it was made several years ago by Southland Conservancy in conjunction with stakeholders in the Milford Track.</p>
<p>In March, a brief of specific requirements was sent to Simone Medio, a Senior Lecturer in Environmental Design. The design for the shelter—used as a day shelter by about 90 people —had to be environmentally sound, durable, easy to replace, able to cope with extreme weather conditions, and be easy to construct. Fourteen students entered designs.</p>
<p>Warren Biggs, Contract and Project Manager for DoC, says the project has so far been a success. &quot;DoC felt that working together with a prestigious tertiary establishment, to design a concept from which the shelter would be produced, would bring significant benefits to both parties - and this has proved to be the case.&quot;</p>
<p>Winner Peter Mora said the competition was a fascinating exercise. &quot;The design brief presented many interesting architectural constraints and challenges, and it took a lot of consideration to provide an appropriate solution to those.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m delighted to have won. To be able to enter into such a competition was a fantastic opportunity and it was great that DoC presented this opportunity to students.&quot;</p>
<p>Construction of the shelter is likely to take place over the next 12 months.</p>
