<p>University of Waikato appoints new director of development</p>
<p>The University of Waikato has appointed Christine Brabender as Director of Development.</p>
<p>Ms Brabender, who takes up the position in August, was most recently Vice-President External Affairs at Chicago’s Notebaert Nature Museum in the United States where her portfolio of responsibilities included fundraising, marketing and board development.</p>
<p>Her previous roles include Marketing Manager at the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences at The University of Auckland, and President of Cyrano Creative Consulting in Chicago, providing strategic fundraising and communications services to universities, health care institutions and cultural organisations.</p>
<p>As Executive Director of the Irvin Stern Foundation, a private charitable trust, Christine made grants to human services, education and civic organisations in ethnically and economically diverse communities.</p>
<p>Her key responsibilities at the University of Waikato will be to develop and drive a strategy to support major capital development projects and enhance the University’s fundraising capacity nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says the University is very pleased to have Ms Brabender on board.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to her arrival here. She has the experience we were looking for to further strengthen our relationships with our alumni, benefactors and partners.”</p>
