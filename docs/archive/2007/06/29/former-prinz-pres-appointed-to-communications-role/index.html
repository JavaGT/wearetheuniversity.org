<p>University of Waikato appoints former PRINZ president to communications role</p>
<p>The University of Waikato has appointed Lisa Finucane, immediate past-president of the Public Relations Institute of New Zealand (PRINZ), as Director of Communications.</p>
<p>Lisa has some 20 years’ experience in PR, encompassing both consultancy work and in-house roles. She has recently been working as a private contractor, having previously spent more than four years as the Communications Manager for Auckland’s water and wastewater utility, Metrowater. Prior to that, she was a founding director of infrastructure specialist PR firm, Core Communications.</p>
<p>The university’s Head of Corporate Services Raymond McNickle welcomed her appointment.</p>
<p>“Lisa will bring to the position the breadth of skills we are looking for to continue building Waikato’s reputation as a great place for students and postgraduate research, and to strengthen our links with our key interest groups both regionally and nationally.”</p>
<p>Lisa has a BA in History and English from the University of Auckland and a Diploma in Public Relations from the then Auckland Technical Institute (now AUT University). She currently sits on the Advisory Board of AUT, and recently completed a semester as a lecturer in the School of Communications.</p>
<p>In 2001, Lisa was elected a Fellow of the Public Relations Institute, and served a two-year term as National President from 2005. During this time, PRINZ developed the role of its national office to support and champion the position of the PR profession within New Zealand in areas such as research, education and continuing professional development, and strategic alliances with comparable international institutions and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Lisa takes up the appointment at the university in August.</p>
