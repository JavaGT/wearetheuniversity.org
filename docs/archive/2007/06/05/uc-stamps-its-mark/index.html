<p>UC stamps its mark</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury has stamped its mark on the latest philatelic offering from New Zealand Post.</p>
<p>The set of five stamps, titled “Southern Skies”, was the brainchild of University of Canterbury astronomer Associate Professor Peter Cottrell and the stamps feature telescopes from UC&#39;s Mt John University Observatory at Tekapo in the Mackenzie Basin, South Canterbury.</p>
<p>Released on 6 June in time for Matariki, the Maori New Year, the stamps celebrate New Zealand’s night skies. Each stamp features a stunning night sky image which is paired with a telescope.</p>
<p>Mt John’s 1m McLellan telescope appears on the $1 stamp while the 1.8m MOA (Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics) telescope features on the $2 stamp. The Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), in which the University of Canterbury has a share, appears on the $2.50 stamp.</p>
<p>Professor Cottrell said the stamps were a wonderful showcase for the University of Canterbury, particularly the College of Science and the Department of Physics and Astronomy.</p>
<p>“I first made contact with NZ Post with the concept for this stamp issue more than two years ago and it is great to see it come to fruition,” said Professor Cottrell.</p>
<p>“I have been involved in the process all the way, including the writing and proofing of the booklet that will be released with the stamp issue.”</p>
<p>The booklet highlights the premier position of the University of Canterbury’s astronomical teaching and research programme.</p>
<p>Professor Cottrell also organised the telescope photos for the stamps and the booklet. Members of the Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand&#39;s Astrophotography Section were responsible for the astronomical images. The president of the society is Dr Karen Pollard, also from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Canterbury.</p>
<p>The stamps are available for purchase at NZ Post Shops or at <a href="http://stamps.nzpost.co.nz">http://stamps.nzpost.co.nz</a>.</p>
