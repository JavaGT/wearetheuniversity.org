<p>Employee sells NZQA computers on Trade Me?</p>
<p>NZQA has launched an investigation into serious allegations that a staff member has been selling approximately 30 ex-NZQA computers on Trade Me, says National&#39;s Education spokeswoman Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;The Authority may have a legitimate explanation for selling machines marked &#39;Property of NZQA&#39; online, but reports of cash payments and despatches from an employee&#39;s home, don&#39;t sound like proper process to me.</p>
<p>&quot;If these allegations are correct this is contrary to Government policy for the disposal of property plus an embarrassing faux pas for NZQA.</p>
<p>&quot;All Government organisations are encouraged to donate used computers to the Computer Access New Zealand Trust (CANZ), which refurbishes machines to give to New Zealand schools.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of our schools rely heavily on sourcing machines from the Trust for our nation&#39;s classrooms.</p>
<p>&quot;If NZQA doesn&#39;t see the importance of supporting computers in schools through CANZ and allows an employee to flick machines off privately, it&#39;s a bad look for the Authority.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister must explain what progress has been made with the internal investigation so far and assure taxpayers that NZQA staff are not profiteering from the disposal of government property.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister also needs to explain why NZQA, given its role in the education sector, is not ensuring its PCs are recycled for the betterment of students&#39; learning through CANZ or other recyclers that work with New Zealand schools.</p>
