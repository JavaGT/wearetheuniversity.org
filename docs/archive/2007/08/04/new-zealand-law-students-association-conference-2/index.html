<p>New Zealand Law Students’ Association Conference 2007</p>
<p>The Anderson Lloyd New Zealand Law Students’ Association Conference 2007 will be held in Christchurch and hosted by the Canterbury University Law School from 28 August – 2 September 2007. This will bring together the winners of all local competitions to compete in the NZLSA National Law Students’ Competition Championships. The Conference is also the venue for the Annual General Meeting of the New Zealand Law Students’ Association.</p>
<p>The law students’ competitions represent the pinnacle of achievement for the various competitors involved, who have all qualified by winning their faculty competitions earlier in the year. The championship winners will in many cases be entitled to represent New Zealand at prestigious international law students’ competitions in 2008, such as the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition, to be held in Washington in March 2008.</p>
<p>The preliminary rounds for the competitions will be held on Wednesday 29 and Thursday 30 August, with the finalists being announced at the Kensington Swan Cocktail Evening at XO Lounge (above Liquidity) on the evening of Thursday 30 August. The finals will be held on Saturday 1 September, and law students, local practitioners and the general public are very welcome to attend. The finals will be held in the following venues:</p>
<p>Bell Gully Mooting:<br>High Court One at 2pm.</p>

<p>On Wednesday 29 August, the NZLSA Council will host a guest speaker from Aotearoa Lawyers for Peace, who will give a public lecture on “International law and mechanisms for achieving peace”. This promises to be an informative occasion and will be of interest to all law students, lawyers and the public. The lecture will be held at 11am at the University of Canterbury, School of Law in Lecture Theatre 108, and all students, lawyers and the public are invited to attend.</p>
<p>The NZLSA would like to sincerely thank Anderson Lloyd for their generous sponsorship of the 2007 conference. NZLSA is grateful to Bell Gully, Russell McVeagh, Buddle Findlay and Minter Ellison for their continued support of the law students’ competitions. NZLSA would also like to thank its other conference supporters including the University of Canterbury School of Law, Kensington Swan, and Russell McVeagh.</p>
