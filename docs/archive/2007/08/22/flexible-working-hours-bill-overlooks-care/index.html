<p>Flexible working hours bill overlooks care of older people</p>
<p>The limitation of the Employment Relations (Flexible Working Hours) Amendment Act to employees with young and dependent children is a significant oversight in a country with an ageing population, says Dr Sally Keeling, Director of the University&#39;s New Zealand Institute for Research on Ageing.</p>
<p>Dr Keeling says it is disappointing that the coverage of the Act remains limited to those with dependent children, after extensive consideration by the select committee.</p>
<p>&quot;This restricted coverage does little to offer flexibility in the work arrangements for those who provide highly significant unpaid care and family support to dependent relatives over the age of 18,&quot; Dr Keeling says.</p>
<p>She says the restriction is also inconsistent with the current Government&#39;s intentions to implement a Carers&#39; Strategy in 2008.</p>
<p>&quot;The original draft legislation made provision for the employment rights of those providing care to dependent relatives, and the current consultations on &quot;Caring for New Zealand Carers&quot; stresses the importance of paid employment in the lives of unpaid carers.&quot;</p>
<p>The New Zealand Institute for Research on Ageing (NZiRA) supports the development of a legislative framework which would offer family-friendly workplace conditions to those who provide unpaid care to family members of all ages.</p>
<p>Dr Keeling&#39;s comments follow a submission made by former NZiRA director Judith Davey to the select committee supporting its general provision and seeking to have its coverage extended.</p>
