<p>Negotiations underway for pay claim for primary school principals.</p>
<p>What are the leaders in a knowledge economy worth? In the run-up to principals’ pay negotiations next week, NZEI Te Riu Roa President and primary school principal Irene Cooper argues that recruiting and retaining school leaders is an essential pre-requisite for a quality public education system for New Zealand&#39;s children and future citizens.</p>
<p>We all believe in quality education: it’s like apple pie. Yet we have a real problem in this country attracting and retaining the primary school leadership that inspires and oversees a quality education for our children. Recent research by NZEI Te Riu Roa, the union representing primary principals, shows that 39 percent of the 90 schools advertising for a principal in the Education Gazette over the past six months have had to do so more than once. Some small rural schools were advertising more than four times.</p>
<p>Being a principal can be wonderful, challenging, exciting, isolating and demanding - but never boring. It requires stamina, commitment and the ability to put in long hours on a huge diversity of tasks while also focusing with your leadership team on the central purpose of student learning. While principals report great satisfaction with their job, they also find the multi-tasking nature of the job highly stressful. Ministry initiatives and paperwork (NZ principals an administrative workload 49 percent heavier than colleagues in other OECD countries), frustration at not having enough time to provide leadership on the “core business” of teaching and learning, inadequate school operations grant funding and long work hours (90 percent of principals work more than 50 hours a week on average; only 2 percent worked less than 45 hours a week, according to a 2005 survey) all take their toll.</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, only 14 percent of teachers aspire to be principals, and nearly a third of principals are within ten years of retirement. If New Zealand schools cannot attract and recruit good people to be school leaders, eventually students’ learning will suffer, along with our internationally respected schooling system.</p>
<p>A fundamental way to address the question of attracting and retaining principals is through better pay. NZEI begins negotiations with the Ministry of Education over a primary principals&#39; claim for a pay increase of between 5% and 18%, depending on the size of their school, on Monday (August 27th). The total cost of the pay claim is likely to be around $35 million: a significant cost, because the problem we face with the recruitment and retention of principals is a substantial one.</p>
<p>The increase principals are seeking would also reinstate a sensible margin between the base salary of a small school principal and the top rate of a classroom teacher. Without that margin, there is little incentive for someone to take on the job of a teaching principal, where management of staff, school administration, compliance issues and managing relationships with a Board come on top of hours in the classroom.</p>
<p>NZEI also wants to see “growing leadership” as a deliberate strategy in education. With the Ministry of Education and the School Trustees Association, we have created a new career pathway model leading to principalship. It now requires appropriate resourcing, something we are negotiating through the current primary teacher collective agreement negotiations.</p>
<p>Principals are united in their concern about workload and stress arising from the 24 hour a day nature of the role and the diversity of tasks and skills the role requires. The concern for many current principals is to provide the conditions and support that help make the job “do-able”.</p>
<p>Sustaining principals’ energies and supporting their professional learning is another critical factor if we are to retain principals and make their role more attractive for future recruitment. Support for on-going learning is central to the principals&#39; claim. It includes a call for 200 sabbatical leave positions of 10 weeks durations, up from a current 40.</p>
<p>An abundance of research shows that investing in school leadership is fundamental to ensuring we maintain and enhance quality public education in the 21st century. As with any human endeavour, the quality of leadership is a significant factor in creating good environments for children&#39;s learning. We need to ensure we have the incentives and support in place to get that leadership. Realistic pay and making a job “do-able” are fundamental incentives, and ones the NZEI believes the community supports principals pursuing.</p>
