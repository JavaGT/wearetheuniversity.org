<p><strong>Tuesday, 21 August 2007, 12:31 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>OUSA challenges stereotypes of Otago students</p>
<p>The Otago University Students’ Association is challenging depictions of our members as beer-guzzling, vomit-covered, couch-burning, law-breaking spoilt brats and are doing something about it.</p>
<p>Throughout the end of August and start of September, students in the traditional ‘scarfieville’ area will be busily decorating their flats and fixing up their gardens for the OUSA House and Garden awards. The awards are designed to illustrate that students can take pride in their flats and environment.</p>
<p>“With a raft of celebrity judges ferreting out the winners of categories such as best guy flat, best girl flat, best bedroom, best garden, best indoor garden, best set-up lounge, best neighbour, best front door, the streets of North Dunedin will never have looked so good,” says OUSA President, Renee Heal. “This is a real opportunity to for students to showcase their creative talents and have a lot of fun in the process.”</p>
<p>OUSA invites you to cover the progress of students as they ready their flats for the contest and to the final awards ceremony. Students are being invited to start getting their flats ready from now, and entries opened officially on 20th August. Judging will take place on the 17th and 18th of September, and the awards ceremony follows on the evening of 19th September.</p>
<p>If you would like to follow the progress of students, or cover the OUSA House and Garden awards, please contact OUSA President Renée Heal. If you would like to join the judging panel, please contact Kristin Gardiner.</p>
