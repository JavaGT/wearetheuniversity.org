<p>NZUSA welcomes Canterbury students</p>
<p>The New Zealand Union of Students&#39; Associations (NZUSA) enthusiastically welcomes the decision of University of Canterbury students to rejoin its&#39; national representative body.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s fantastic that students have voted overwhelmingly in the recent referendum for the University of Canterbury Students&#39; Association (UCSA) to rejoin NZUSA&quot; says Josh Clark, NZUSA Co-President. &quot;Having UCSA back in the national body will ensure that once again Canterbury students have a national voice.&quot;</p>
<p>UCSA President Belinda Bundy also expressed her pleasure at the referendum&#39;s outcome, saying &quot;Our students have spoken, and what they have told us is that they want to stand up and be counted. I&#39;m incredibly pleased the UCSA is in a position to carry out this mandate we have been given. I look forward to working much more closely with NZUSA and its&#39; members in the very near future and I am very excited at the prospect of what we can achieve collectively&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re really looking forward to a strong, united student voice for 2008. This will be fundamental in achieving wins for students in the 2008 election and beyond&quot; said Josh Clark, NZUSA Co-President.</p>
<p>NZUSA has 16 member students&#39; associations representing over 165,000 students at universities and polytechnics around New Zealand.</p>
