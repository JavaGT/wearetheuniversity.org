<p>Tuesday 14 August; 6pm-7.30pm</p>
<p>Lecture Theatre 3; Government Buildings, Law School, 15 Lambton Quay, VUW Pipitea Campus</p>
<p>Panel Discussion: Resistance - an indigenous response to neo-liberalism</p>
<p>Seven weeks ago, on a cold Tuesday night in central Wellington, people from all walks of life crowded into two lecture theatres, squashed together to hear someone the Rolling Stones named the ‘sweet black angel’.</p>
<p>Hundreds were turned away from the lecture of a lifetime – Professor Angela Davis, the quintessential voice of resistance.</p>
<p>And so I think of her, as I welcome us all here tonight, with her challenge, that</p>
<p>“Revolution is a serious thing, the most serious thing about a revolutionary&#39;s life. When one commits oneself to the struggle, it must be for a lifetime”.</p>
<p>Tonight we celebrate lifetime activists, academics and leaders who have come together as Maori, to challenge the global domination of neo-liberalism.</p>
<p>The publication, Resistance: An indigenous response to neo-liberalism, starts from the premise that Aotearoa is one of the world leaders of neo-liberalism.</p>
<p>This book provides us all with a chance to consider what part we play as individuals and as collectives, in challenging the relentless advancement of so-called ‘free-trade’; the new right, of colonisation.</p>
<p>As I was thinking about this panel tonight – I looked up the interpretation of ‘resistance’ in Te Matatiki – the resource of contemporary Maori words.</p>
<p>It defined the capacity to resist as ‘kaha papare’ to turn aside, to ward off.</p>

<p>And it made me think of all the everyday people who have been warding off neo-liberal practices in controlling lives; the everyday heroes who demonstrate kaha papare in all that they do.</p>
<p>Resistance (the book) tells us that neo-liberalism is challenged simply from Maori living – and from maintaining alternative world views.</p>
<p>And so I think about eight year old Te Punawai Hotu, with help from Mum, who wrote to the local paper a couple of weeks back, saying “Actions speak louder than shallow words from media commentators who blame all Maori and treat Maori as a dirty word”.</p>
<p>For Te Punawai, Maori living is the ultimate act of resistance – as she urges us all to do as she suggests, concluding that “my whanau and I will continue to make a positive difference in this world as Maori and as citizens of Aotearoa”.</p>
<p>I think, too, about TVNZ security guard Louis Rawnsley, who was fired from his post of 24 years, for a comment he made to talkback guest, Christine Rankin that her comments were over the top, and “it was a bit harsh to blame all Maori for the actions of four idiots”.</p>
<p>I think about our own friend Hone Harawira, who has chosen to defy the code of silence that politicians are meant to adhere to – in failing to ignore the oppressive, paternalistic, military interventions of the Howard Government.</p>
<p>I am heartened by the knowledge that “When one commits oneself to the struggle, it must be for a lifetime”.</p>
<p>Tonight is a night to cherish three of our everyday heroes who have truly committed to the life time struggle–</p>
<p>- Dr Maria Bargh, of Te Arawa and Ngati Awa;</p>
<p>- Dr Alice Te Punga Somerville, Te Atiawa ki Waiwhetu; and</p>
<p>- Moana Jackson of Ngati Kahungunu and Ngati Porou.</p>
<p>I know we are in very good hands as I open the floor – to the sweet black angels of Aotearoa; whom we all know, are committed, as Te Punawai and her whanau are, to making a positive difference in this world as Maori and as citizens of Aotearoa.</p>
