<p>Hon Dr Nick Smith MP<br>National Party Building and Construction Spokesman</p>

<p>Resignation highlights ongoing leaky homes debacle</p>
<p>National Party Building spokesman Nick Smith says he is not at all surprised by the resignation of Auckland City Councillor Douglas Armstrong over the council&#39;s problems with leaky homes.</p>
<p>&quot;This resignation is a sign of the pressure the Auckland City Council is under from the Government&#39;s poor handling of leaky homes.</p>
<p>&quot;The Auckland City Council should come clean with the scale of its overall liability so its ratepayers realise just how serious a problem this is.</p>
<p>&quot;The madness of the Government&#39;s response is that over $85 million has been spent on the bureaucracy of the Weathertight Homes Tribunal, and after five years, only 15% of cases have been resolved.</p>
<p>&quot;This amounts to $110,000 on the bureaucracy surrounding settlement, when the average settlement is only $70,000.</p>
<p>&quot;The current process is costing ratepayers and taxpayers millions on lawyers and consultants with too little actually being spent on fixing the houses.</p>
<p>&quot;Three times Labour has tried to fix the leaky homes problem and three times it has failed. Thousands of leaky-home owners are still waiting for justice, councils have been left carrying the baby, and the Government&#39;s Weathertight Homes Tribunal is buried ever deeper in bureaucracy.</p>
<p>&quot;Government policy on leaky homes is failing homeowners and councils. National is developing, in consultation with affected homeowners and councils, a fresh new approach to resolving this critical issue for Auckland.&quot;</p>
