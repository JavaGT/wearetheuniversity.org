<p>Abbey Lodge to become postgraduate centre</p>
<p>The University of Otago is planning to establish New Zealand’s first residential college for postgraduate students.</p>
<p>The bold move has been made possible by the recent purchase of Abbey Lodge, a hotel complex in the campus area of North Dunedin. The new residence will be called Abbey College.</p>
<p>University Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg says Abbey Lodge provides a superb site for a postgraduate residence. “It has about 80 beds in recently refurbished accommodation. Many of the rooms have en suite bathroom facilities and some have kitchenettes. There is a restaurant, cafeteria and conference facilities, suitable for academic purposes, and even an indoor heated swimming pool, spa and sauna.”</p>
<p>Professor Skegg says the development of dedicated accommodation for postgraduate students underpins Otago’s strategic direction.</p>
<p>“As New Zealand’s most research-intensive university, Otago plans to recruit a higher proportion of postgraduate students, especially research students. Postgraduate students form part of the essential life-blood of a research-led university, such as Otago. This University contains many internationally-renowned research groups which can provide outstanding opportunities for postgraduate education. The establishment of Abbey College means that we can also offer graduates an unrivalled campus experience.”</p>
<p>The purchase of Abbey Lodge includes land that could be used for future developments. In the meantime, this will be landscaped to provide further green space in North Dunedin.</p>
<p>It is expected that Abbey College will admit postgraduate students from the beginning of 2008.</p>
