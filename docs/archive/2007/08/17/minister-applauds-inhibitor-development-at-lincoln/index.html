<p>Climate Change Minister applauds inhibitor development at Lincoln University</p>
<p>A &quot;once in a lifetime&quot; breakthrough is how the Minister Responsible for Climate Change Issues, David Parker, describes the development of eco-n nitrification inhibitor technology at Lincoln University.</p>
<p>Mr Parker visited Lincoln University´s lysimeter laboratory and dairy farm drainage facilities on 14th August with the developers of eco-n, Professor Keith Cameron and Professor Hong Di, and commented on the &quot;exceptional work&quot; conducted by the University-based Centre for Soil and Environmental Quality.</p>
<p>Discussing the scientists´ research with Lincoln University´s Deputy Vice- Chancellor Dr Chris Kirk and Mike Manning and Ron Pellow of Ravensdown, the Minister applauded Professor Cameron and Professor Di and suggested that their research would earn them a Nobel Prize if they were working in the field of physics.</p>
<p>The two scientists showed the Minister results from the use of the inhibitor eco-n on the Lincoln University Dairy Farm where nitrate leaching from urine patches had been reduced by up to 60%, nitrous oxide emissions (a greenhouse gas) had been reduced by about 70% and annual pasture production had increased by over 15%.</p>
<p>Professor Di said that trial work from other parts of New Zealand was showing average reductions in nitrous oxide emissions of about 70% from urine patches in a range of soils from Hamilton to Taupo to Canterbury. Urine patches are the predominant source of nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide emissions in grazed pastures.</p>
<p>Ravensdown introduced nitrification inhibitors to farmers with its product eco-n in 2004 and has seen steady increases in interest for the environmental and pasture production opportunities available through eco-n.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand has doubled this year,&quot; said Mr Manning, General Manager Research and Development at Ravensdown, &quot;as dairy farmers seek to increase the efficiency and reduce the environmental impacts of their farm systems.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking to the New Zealand Institute of Agricultural and Horticultural Science convention earlier in the day the Minister said that the development of nitrification inhibitors was &quot;standout technology&quot; and showed the efforts underway in New Zealand agriculture to develop solutions to greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
