<p>17 August 2007</p>
<p>Corrections failure lets $1m of &#39;P&#39; onto streets</p>
<p>The Government’s failure to get on top of the prison contraband problem is directly responsible for $1 million of methamphetamine getting onto the streets of Auckland, Wanganui, and Wellington, says National’s Justice &amp; Corrections spokesman, Simon Power.</p>
<p>He is commenting after a court was told the methamphetamine was imported from Thailand by a prisoner using an unauthorised cellphone from inside Rimutaka.</p>
<p>“The Labour Government’s failure to heed warnings about the extent of the contraband problem is directly to blame for this drug deal happening.</p>
<p>“If this prisoner didn’t have a cellphone, it wouldn’t have happened.</p>
<p>“Not only does it seem a deal was conducted from inside one of our toughest prisons, but it was done right under the nose of a special corruption inquiry there – which has been going on for 10 months.</p>
<p>“The Government should give an assurance that this latest incident will be covered by the inquiry to ensure the cellphone wasn’t smuggled in by staff.</p>
<p>“This must be an acute embarrassment for Minister Damien O’Connor and CEO Barrie Matthews, who have tried to talk tough in recent months on contraband.</p>
<p>“But they were too slow to act. For far too long they did little to stop the flow of contraband into our prisons, even denying there was a big problem.</p>
<p>“Then finally, in June, they contradicted those denials by saying they would establish an anti-corruption unit.</p>
<p>“They also promised new technology to disable mobile phones. That was way back in May, so where is it? They don’t have to invent it, just buy it.</p>
<p>“Money shouldn’t be a problem in a department rife with overspending: tens of thousands of dollars on flat-screen TVs and Playstations, $1 million a month on consultants, a $1 million annual bill for intention damage – and $1.7 million in staff bonuses.</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t be hard to find savings there.</p>
<p>“Under the Labour Government, Rimutaka has become a haven for criminals to continue their illegal activities unhindered.</p>
<p>“It’s time for a full parliamentary inquiry into this department.”</p>
