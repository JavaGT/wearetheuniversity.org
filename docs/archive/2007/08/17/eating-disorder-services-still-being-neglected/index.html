<p><strong>Friday, 17 August 2007, 12:00 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Dr Jackie Blue MP<br>National Party Women’s Affairs Spokeswoman</p>
<p>17 August 2007</p>
<p>Eating disorder services still being neglected by Govt</p>
<p>National’s Women&#39;s Affairs spokeswoman, Dr Jackie Blue, wants the Health Minister to explain what he’s done to address a chronic lack of services for people with eating disorders, a year after a highly critical report was released.</p>
<p>“A 2006 Ministry of Health report highlighted serious shortfalls in services around the country. Not only is there a workforce shortage, but there remains a lack of specialist beds for eating disorder sufferers.</p>
<p>“Another major problem is a lack of national co-ordination around eating disorder services.</p>
<p>“I would have expected Pete Hodgson to have acted immediately to address growing concerns, but he’s done little of note.”</p>
<p>Dr Blue says that’s not surprising, given the ignorant and dismissive response from one of the Minister’s officials who was responding to a query by an AUT communications student.</p>
<p>“When asked about the regional variation in services, the official said ‘services are not always available where little boys and girls with eating disorders live’.</p>
<p>“That’s an appalling attitude.</p>
<p>“Between 10% and 15% of the population at any one time suffers from an eating disorder.</p>
<p>“Around 280 new cases are diagnosed each year, yet there are only 13 beds at in-patient clinics dedicated to eating disorders.</p>
<p>“Eating disorders include anorexia nervosa which is a life-threatening illness affecting more and more young women.</p>
<p>“I can only hope the Minister ignores the appallingly ignorant advice of his official and acts on his own Ministry’s report which is now over a year old – sooner rather than later.”</p>
