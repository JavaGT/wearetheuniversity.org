<p><strong>Wednesday, 29 August 2007, 3:33 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Supporting New Zealand&#39;s Young Care-givers</p>
<p>Public health researcher Janet McDonald is seeking participants for her study of young people who care for or support an ill or disabled family member.</p>
<p>A Masters student and research assistant with the University&#39;s Health Services Research Centre, Ms McDonald aims to find out about the experiences of both young carers and those they support, and to develop an understanding of what leads to this particular type of family caring.</p>
<p>She says the role of caregivers is often in the spotlight, most recently amid current Government consultations on the development of a Carers&#39; Strategy. One of the proposed themes of the Strategy is &#39;young carers&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Although overseas research has identified the potential needs of young carers, and some countries such as Britain and Australia now have specific young carer services, we know little about the experiences of young carers in New Zealand,&quot; Ms McDonald says.</p>
<p>The 2001 Census shows 9 percent of 15-18 year olds and 10 percent of 19-24 year olds have cared for someone who was ill or disabled.</p>
<p>&quot;Children under the age of 15 may also be caring but their number is unknown as they are not asked this Census question. Nor do these statistics tell us how long children are caring for or what this role involves for them.&quot;</p>
<p>She is seeking pairs of participants (ie. a young carer aged 14-25 and the person they support) to take part in separate interviews.</p>
<p>She has funding support from the Health Research Council of New Zealand through a Disability Research Placement Programme award.</p>
