<p>Thursday, August 9, 2007<br>World rankings place Massey in top three New Zealand universities</p>
<p>Massey University has substantially increased its rankings in the annual Shanghai Jiao Tong University ranking of the world’s top 500 universities.</p>
<p>Five New Zealand universities have made it into the latest rankings. Auckland University is highest ranked, with Massey and the University of Otago second equal, followed by Canterbury and Victoria.</p>
<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic and Research) Professor Nigel Long says it is pleasing that five New Zealand research-led universities have been ranked among the world’s top 500, in a respected measure such as the Shanghai Jiao Tong.</p>
<p>“I congratulate all Massey researchers for contributing to such a great result.”</p>
<p>Massey recorded the biggest gain of the New Zealand universities, moving from a ranking of between 401 and 500 last year to between 305 and 401 this year. Of the universities in the Asia-Pacific region, it is ranked between 43 and 64, compared with 64-92 last year.</p>
<p>Auckland is ranked between 203 and 304 in the world and 25-42 in the region; Canterbury and Victoria are in the 402-508 world rank range and 65-99 in the region.</p>
<p>American universities, again headed by Harvard, comprise eight of the top ten universities internationally, with Cambridge slipping from third place to fourth and Oxford maintaining its tenth position. Japanese universities occupy six of the top nine places in the Asia-Pacific region, with the Australian National University ranked third after Tokyo and Kyoto Universities.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Jiao Tong ranking measures universities by several indicators of academic or research performance, including articles published in journals such as Nature and Science, staff and alumni winning Nobel or other prestige prizes, and academic performance with respect to the size of the institution.</p>
