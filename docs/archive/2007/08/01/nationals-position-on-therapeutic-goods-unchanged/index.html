<p><strong>Wednesday, 1 August 2007, 10:59 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>John Key MP<br>National Party Leader</p>
<p>1 August 2007</p>
<p>National’s position on therapeutic goods unchanged</p>
<p>The National Party’s position on the trans-Tasman Therapeutic Goods regime is the same today as it has been since the proposal was first examined by a select committee in 2003, says National Party Leader John Key.</p>
<p>“If the Government removes the complementary medicines from the legislation, then we will support it. If they don’t, we won’t.</p>
<p>“That has been our position since 2003 and continues to be our position.</p>
<p>“I have personally explained our position to Australian Prime Minister John Howard, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, and High Commissioner John Dauth. I have also explained it to Helen Clark and Michael Cullen.</p>
<p>“Today’s NZ Herald story misrepresents our position. The story correctly quotes me as saying ‘If they came to us now with that proposal, we will sign it.’</p>
<p>“I was, of course, referring to the Trans-Tasman Therapeutic Goods regime - not the proposal put up by NZ First. I repeatedly made that clear to the NZ Herald yesterday.</p>
<p>“National has never received a copy of the NZ First proposal, to the best of our knowledge.</p>
<p>“Our position is simple: If complementary medicines are removed from the regime, National will support it.</p>
<p>“We have stated our position in thousands of letters and emails to concerned New Zealanders, to Government ministers verbally on many occasions, and in:</p>
<p>* The National Party’s minority report on the select committee inquiry, 18 June 2004.<br>* A letter from former National Party Leader Don Brash to the Prime Minister, on 7 July 2004.<br>* A letter from Murray McCully and Tony Ryall to Phil Goff and Annette King, on 30 June 2006.<br>* A letter from Tony Ryall to Health Minister Annette King, on 12 September 2006.</p>
<p>“If we are presented with a proposal from the Government that meets our position, we will support it. If the Government doesn’t, then we won’t.”</p>
