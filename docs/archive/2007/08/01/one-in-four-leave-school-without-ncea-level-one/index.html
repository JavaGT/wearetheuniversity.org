<p><strong>Wednesday, 1 August 2007, 10:47 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Katherine Rich MP<br>National Party Education Spokeswoman</p>
<p>1 August 2007</p>
<p>One in four leave school without NCEA level one</p>
<p>“New figures show 25% of all students leave school without achieving an NCEA level 1 qualification - the equivalent of the old School Certificate,” says National Party Education spokeswoman Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>“More than 14,000 students left school last year without the most basic secondary school qualification. The Minister crows about the ‘improvement’ but appears complacent about the failure.</p>
<p>“Without level 1 NCEA, a school leaver’s options are limited. Many institutions providing further education and training require, as a minimum entry requirement, level 1 NCEA.</p>
<p>“We are in real trouble when one in four students don&#39;t even make it to the starting line.”</p>
<p>Mrs Rich says it is a sad day when the Minister thinks statistics which show that after 12 years of schooling 25% have failed to achieve NCEA level 1 is good news.</p>
<p>“That one-in-four failure rate is about the same as that for the national standard for literacy.</p>
<p>“When students are coming out of our schools unprepared for life in a modern, dynamic economy, alarm bells should be ringing in the Beehive.”</p>
<p>National’s Leader, John Key, outlined National’s Trades and Skills policy last month, and earlier in the year pledged his support for national standards in reading and maths.</p>
<p>“Schools need to remain relevant and engaging for young people. The latest statistics prove the need for new thinking on how we prepare our children for life beyond the classroom.”</p>
