<p>Investment in overseas students overdue</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s announcement that it is finally ready to deal with the dramatic decline in the number of overseas students wanting to study in this country is long overdue, says National&#39;s Associate Education spokeswoman, Pansy Wong.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour appears to have had a road to Damascus experience after running down international education over the past eight years.</p>
<p>&quot;In 2004 there were 112,675 foreign fee-paying students, which slumped to 98,266 by 2005. A more than 10% drop in a single year cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>&quot;What was a growing and lucrative foreign currency earner for New Zealand has suffered at the hands of Labour&#39;s inconsistent immigration and international education policies.</p>
<p>&quot;For an industry that was touted as the 5th biggest export earner in New Zealand, worth 1.8 billion dollars, the $10 million announced today is a belated apology for getting it so wrong over the past eight years.&quot;</p>
