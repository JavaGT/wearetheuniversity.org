<p>Risk of deaths if horse flu spreads to New Zealand</p>
<p>Equine influenza can be fatal in horse populations like New Zealand and Australia’s that have not previously been exposed to the viral infections, says Massey Professor of Equine Studies Joe Mayhew.</p>
<p>Professor Mayhew, a lecturer in equine medicine and neurology at the Institute of Veterinary Animal and Biomedical Sciences at Palmerston North, says the outbreak of influenza in Australian horses needs to be taken seriously by New Zealand because of the close relationship between our thoroughbred racing and breeding industries.</p>
<p>“Many of the horses that come into New Zealand from other countries do so via Australia,” Professor Mayhew says. “MAF [Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry] Biosecurity here have done a very good job in advising the public and the veterinary profession what to do, in closing down importation of stock from Australia and following up the horses that have come in since 1 August. The information from them is very sensible and very clear.”</p>
<p>However, he says there are misconceptions about equine influenza – that it is not fatal to horses and that thoroughbreds are more susceptible than other horses. Outbreaks in naïve populations – those that have little or no previous exposure – have been fatal in several eastern European countries and South Africa, he says. This usually involves young or aged horses but can be in apparently healthy, previously unaffected adult horses.</p>
<p>“There could easily be deaths [in Australia], particularly depending on which viral strain is involved. I expect there won’t be though because they would tend to have happened already with all the positive blood tests recorded.”</p>

<p>Because they often live in bigger groups and closer proximity than other breeds of horses, thoroughbreds and standardbreds may spread infection more readily, but because they tend to be very fit animals, are no more likely to suffer ill effects of the disease.</p>
<p>A fit horse that continued to be exercised or raced after exposure could easily end up with secondary illnesses like pneumonia, in the same way a fit human might more easily shake off the effects of influenza than an unhealthy person, but could also get very sick if they continued trying to keep fit after exposure.</p>

<p>Anyone who suspects their horse may be showing symptoms of equine influenza should contact their vet immediately or phone the MAF Biosecurity New Zealand emergency hotline 0800-809-966.</p>
