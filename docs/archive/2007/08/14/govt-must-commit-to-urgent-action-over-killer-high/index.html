<p><strong>Tuesday, 14 August 2007, 1:02 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Dr Paul Hutchison<br>National Party MP for Port Waikato</p>
<p>14 August 2007</p>
<p>Govt must commit to urgent action over killer highway</p>
<p>National MP Paul Hutchison is calling on the Government to pull its head out of the sand and commit to a plan to four-lane the state highway between Pokeno and Thames.</p>
<p>“Yesterday’s serious bus crash involving three vehicles would almost certainly have been prevented if the road was four-laned.</p>
<p>“Over the past few years, this killer highway has claimed 40 lives and has been the site of countless serious accidents.</p>
<p>“The road has been described by locals as a ‘gauntlet of death’, yet Labour continues to ignore their pleas to upgrade it.”</p>
<p>Dr Hutchison says despite numerous letters to Transit, successive Labour Ministers of Transport and a petition by local people to Parliament, the Labour Government has failed to ensure New Zealand’s most dangerous state highway is made safer.</p>
<p>“This is a Third World road in the new millennium. It is an unacceptable disgrace.</p>
<p>“The least the Government can do is commit to a four-lane highway between Pokeno and Thames.</p>
<p>“All the Labour Government has done is a series of patch-up jobs on the road. The area around Maramarua won’t be done for 15 years and the major portion of the highway has no commitment plan.</p>
<p>“This work must be fast-tracked or there will be more preventable deaths.”</p>
