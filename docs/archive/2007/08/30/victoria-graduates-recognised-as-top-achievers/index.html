<p>Victoria graduates recognised as top achievers</p>
<p>Three Victoria University graduates have won funding worth almost $600,000 in the Tertiary Education Commission&#39;s Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarships announced today.</p>
<p>Matthew French and Jason Varuhas, both studying at the University of Cambridge in Britain, were awarded the two largest grants. Jason was awarded $247,230 and will be looking at &#39;Damages for human rights breaches&#39;, while Matthew was awarded $246,978 for his research on &#39;The influence of bioclimatic architectural principles in the morphology of contemporary Latin American urban informal settlements&#39;.</p>
<p>Adrian Jongenelen is studying at Victoria, and has been awarded $100,044 to study &#39;Development of a compact, portable, real-time range imaging system&#39;.</p>
<p>Almost $3 million was awarded to postgraduate students throughout the country in this round of funding.</p>
<p>Victoria&#39;s Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Research), Professor Charles Daugherty, says the announcement of the scholarships shows the level of achievement of Victoria graduates.</p>
<p>&quot;Victoria aims to instil in its students skills of leadership, creative and critical thinking, and communication.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re delighted that these students have been recognised by TEC and that they have this opportunity to contribute to the pool of knowledge in their chosen disciplines.&quot;</p>
