<p>Fullbright scholarship leads to research on why so few women become sports coaches</p>
<p>The University’s Director of Sport, Dr Sarah Leberman, has won a Fullbright Scholarship to the United States, which she will use to study the issue of why women – particularly mothers – tend not to become sports coaches.</p>
<p>Dr Leberman, a Senior Lecturer in Sport Management in the College of Business’s Department of Management, will spend four months at the Tucker Centre for Research on Girls and Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis-St Paul. The centre is the only one of its kind in the world.</p>
<p>Existing research focuses on coaches at the elite level, but she says it is time to consider why men still dominate in coaching sport. There seems to be a perception among girls in sports teams that for a team to have a good coach the coach should be a man, she says.</p>
<p>“Little is known about the influence mothers have on children with respect to sport and their position as role models for children in sport.</p>
<p>“This is like the final frontier for women. Increasing numbers are making it to the top in business, in politics, academia and competing in sports, but when it comes to coaching, sport administration and governance they are very much in the minority.”</p>
<p>She says the reasons for this may include lack of role models and mentors. “There may also be a lack of confidence or issues with childcare that see fewer women managing and coaching sport.</p>
<p>“Much of the previous research has focussed on the work-life conflict experienced by women in paid coaching positions overseas, whereas the situation in New Zealand is different, with few paid coaching positions available and the majority of coaches, sport administrators and board roles being voluntary positions which need to fit in around often full-time work and family commitments.</p>

<p>“The aim of the Fulbright programme is to encourage the exchange of ideas between New Zealand and the United States and as sport plays a prominent role in the culture and economy of both countries it provides an excellent platform from which to start a positive dialogue.”</p>
<p>As a specialist in sport management and the sociology of sport, she has a long-term focus on women in sport leadership. She will also use the study award to explore findings in the United States related to women in decision making roles in sport and the barriers to women getting into these roles.</p>
<p>“This experience will enable me to integrate new learning into my research and sport management teaching, as well as my community work. It will provide me with a greater understanding of sport and the education system in the United States and facilitate the promotion of study opportunities to students I interact with in academia, as well as the athletes I interact with through my sporting involvement.</p>
<p>“Through my role as Director of Sport at Massey and as an executive board member of the New Zealand Centre for Women and Leadership, I intend to continue to develop my professional relationships with academics from the United States and to encourage Massey colleagues to either study or conduct research in the United States.”<br>Dr Leberman has been involved in the sport and recreation industry within New Zealand for the past 19 years as an academic, practitioner, consultant, administrator and participant. She is one of the five recipients of the latest Fulbright New Zealand Senior Scholar Awards.</p>
<p>She leaves on 1 October.</p>
