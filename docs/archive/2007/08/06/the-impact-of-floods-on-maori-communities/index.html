<p>The impact of floods on Maori communities</p>
<p>A new study reveals special difficulties faced by Maori during the floods that affected the Manawatu-Wanganui region in 2004.</p>
<p>The research, by Massey University’s Centre for Indigenous Governance and Development in collaboration with Ngati Pikahu, examines the effectiveness of various approaches in providing information, reducing stress and anxiety and facilitating an effective recovery process.</p>
<p>It also suggests ways in which problems could be avoided or mitigated during future emergencies.</p>
<p>Researchers worked alongside kaumatua and other whanau members of Ngati Pikiahu to look primarily at the role of Poupatate Marae in the Manawatu during the 2004 floods. Many whanau were relocated to Poupatate Marae for safety reasons and to gain access to marae resources. The research also used data from studies of other marae in the Manawatu that were affected by the floods. The researchers say their study should contribute to improving emergency policy development and management, particularly with respect to marae and Maori communities.</p>
<p>Findings included:</p>
<p> A lack of meaningful interaction between the district council, marae and Maori communities, and a lack of Maori “presence” within the district.<br> A lack of communication between civil defence groups and Poupatate marae.<br> Stress was reduced by being at the marae with access to “marae-style” counselling.<br> There is a need for greater awareness by Maori communities and emergency management groups of differing practices and processes. Civil defence planning also excludes Maori input.<br> Applying for compensation was not always seen as appropriate, given Maori perspectives on reimbursement.</p>

<p>The research showed that, during the emergency, Poupatate and other marae were focal points, not only for local Maori but also for civil defence teams. “For this reason they should be incorporated meaningfully into civil defence policy and plans. Maori communities should also be consulted during planning. It is also clear that an exchange of information about marae locations, contact people and available services would increase the options available to civil defence groups, to provide for local Maori and the wider community as well.</p>
<p>According to Mr Hare Arapere, a kaumatua of Poupatate Marae “We [Maori] have been applying our own tikanga to deal with natural disasters for generations [and] it works for us. And we’re willing share our knowledge and ways of doing things with [local government] if it benefits the wider community.”</p>
<p>This sentiment was also reflected in the research findings. The researchers say recent flooding incidents in New Zealand, including the 2004 floods, have brought to the attention of the local government sector the need for more effective and meaningful engagement by district and regional Councils with Maori concerning decision making within communities, including emergency management.</p>
