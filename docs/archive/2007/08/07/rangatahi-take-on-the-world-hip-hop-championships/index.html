<p>Rangatahi take on the World Hip-Hop Championships 2007</p>
<p>Te Ururoa Flavell, Member of Parliament for Waiariki</p>
<p>Tuesday 7 August 2007</p>
<p>&quot;Our rangatahi are not only fearless - they are world show-stoppers as well&quot; said Waiariki MP, Te Ururoa Flavell upon hearing the news that Rotorua hip-hop group, Fearless, was placed third at the World Hip-Hop championships in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Hip Hop Crews from throughout the World competed at the World Hip Hop Championships which were held on 29th July on Redondo Beach in California.</p>
<p>&quot;You can&#39;t get much better than this&quot; enthused Flavell. &quot;Crews from more than thirty nations across the globe came together for the world championship, and our kids come home with the bronze!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Over one thousand street performers did their thing, and it was our very own &#39;Fearless&#39; that put Aotearoa on the map, again&quot;. In 2006 Aotearoa entered the World Championship for the first time with Auckland-based crew DZIAH coming second.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the international premier event for hip hop&quot; said Flavell. &quot;As we think about the theme of the World&#39;s Indigenous Day which falls this Thursday (9 August) it couldn&#39;t be better timing to celebrate this outstanding group of rangatahi&quot;.</p>
<p>The theme for the 2007 International Day of the World&#39;s Indigenous People is &#39;honouring indigenous youth&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;It does the heart good to think about just how awesome our kids are&quot; said Flavell. &quot;And a big mihi too, to all the whanau who have been fearless in their fund-raising and their tautoko to support their rangatahi on to the world stage&quot;.</p>
