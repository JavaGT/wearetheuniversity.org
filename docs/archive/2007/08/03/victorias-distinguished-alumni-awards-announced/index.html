<p>“The University is proud to recognise these alumni and their achievements.”</p>
<p>The six will be presented with their awards later this year at the Annual Alumni Dinner, a black-tie event held at the Wellington Town Hall on 11 October, principally sponsored by the Wellington City Council and the Dominion Post. Distinguished Alumni Awards are made each year at the dinner.</p>
