<p><strong>Monday, 20 August 2007, 12:02 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Workers_Party_of_New_Zealand">Workers Party of New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>For immediate release</p>
<p>The Workers Party is standing retail worker and history student Byron Clark for mayor. &quot;Christchurch is a working class city but the council and mayor don&#39;t represent working class interests. When was the last time one of them was seen on a picket line supporting workers? asks Mr Clark who has been active in helping unionise low-paid workers, in support work for the locked-out distribution workers last year and in campaigning against youth rates. &quot;I also support low-paid council workers who have had pay rises in recent years that are actually below the rate of inflation and are subjected to restructuring policies which always work against them.&quot; He also wants to address issues of local democracy, citing the closing of Edgeware pool and the recent council decision to build a road through Cashel Mall despite overwhelming opposition.</p>
<p>The Workers Party is currently campaigning to sign up 500 members to contest the party vote in the next general election, and is calling on those who vote for them in this year&#39;s local election to become members.</p>
