<p>North Shore City : New Zealand’s Premier Destination</p>
<p>One of the interesting aspects of the redevelopment of the transport networks around Takapuna is how our community is reshaping itself for the future.</p>
<p>As you enter Takapuna from the motorway on to the new section of Fred Thomas Drive, the marvellous opportunities to redevelop the Barrys Point area are instantly apparent. The retail premises have already been substantially upgraded and apartments have also been built in the area. The views from the ridgeline of Barrys Point Road across to the city show the opportunity for an impressive new level of development in the ‘gateway’ to our city.</p>
<p>Takapuna itself is going through a substantial resurgence. The Sentinel apartment complex is almost complete and there are major new projects about to be launched, including one on the old City Council Gasometer site. Over the next few years we are going to see a dramatic transformation of the Takapuna – Barrys Point Road area.</p>
<p>This afternoon I am visiting the new Westfield development at Albany. This will be New Zealand’s largest retail complex, and we are all looking forward to its opening. It really will bring a dramatic new era of retail into the Albany precinct.</p>
<p>Massey University has really matured into providing an impressive level of tertiary education focussed on high end technology and business. AUT at Akoranga has real strengths in the health sciences, and high performance sport and education research.</p>

<p>These two tertiary institutions, along with the excellence of our secondary schools, and a range of private tertiary providers, are building the high skilled workforce that will enable North Shore to be New Zealand’s leading city and building the foundation for 21st century prosperity.</p>
<p>As we lead into the local body elections, it is very clear that the city is going through a dramatic new phase of growth. North Shore City is being tied together with the completion of the busway, the comprehensive redevelopment at Albany, our world class educational institutions, and the revitalisation of our key city centres, especially Takapuna.</p>
<p>The scene is really being set for New Zealand’s premier city for life, work and leisure.<br>24 August 2007</p>
