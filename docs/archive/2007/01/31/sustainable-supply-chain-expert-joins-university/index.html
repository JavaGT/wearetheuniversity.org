<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>Sustainable supply chain expert joins University of Waikato</p>
<p>31 January 2007</p>
<p>Dr Stefan Seuring-Stella has been appointed Associate Professor of Supply Chain Management at the University of Waikato Management School. An authority on sustainable supply chains, Dr Seuring has come to Waikato from Oldenburg University in Germany and has also been visiting professor at the Copenhagen Business School.</p>
<p>Dr Seuring has an academic background in management studies, environmental management and chemistry. His research interests centre on the way supply chains are managed integrating a wider set of social and environmental objectives.</p>
<p>Dr Seuring is currently working with his colleagues in the Department of Management Systems looking at ways to optimise supply chain processes in New Zealand companies and organisations.</p>
<p>“I’m now looking to work with companies that want to green their supply chains,” says Dr Seuring. “The recent food miles campaign shows that New Zealand has got to work harder to counter the impact of our geographical isolation. Our big advantage is our natural environment, and we need to look at developing organic and sustainable products which carry a premium in the market.</p>
<p>“One of the challenges is tracking compliance throughout the chain of production and optimising processes to offset the higher costs of compliance. This is where I can help.”</p>
<p>Dr Seuring’s appointment reflects Waikato Management School&#39;s commitment to strengthening its distinctive research focus on sustainability.</p>
