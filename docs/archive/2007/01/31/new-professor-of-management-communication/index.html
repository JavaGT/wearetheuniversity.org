<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>New professor of management communication for Waikato Management School</p>
<p>31 January 2007</p>
<p>Dr Kay Weaver has been appointed Professor of Management Communication at the University of Waikato Management School. A former policewoman and journalist, Prof Weaver has written extensively on violence and the media; her most recent book Women and Violence in the Media was published last year.</p>
<p>Her research interests also include public relations analysis, activist campaigns, science communication and use of information communication technologies in rural New Zealand communities.</p>
<p>Her latest research project looks at the impact on the community of installing broadband internet access in Te Pahu, a rural community near Hamilton. “We’re interested in how broadband will change family life, and how it will impact on school kids and people who work from home,” says Prof Weaver.</p>
<p>“Currently Te Pahu is a really physical community, people who live there take part in a lot of shared activities. With broadband, we want to find out if and how that will change.”</p>
<p>Prof Weaver is also active in teaching communication and public relations at undergraduate and post-graduate levels</p>
