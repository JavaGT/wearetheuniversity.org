<p><strong>Wednesday, 17 January 2007, 3:55 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Katherine Rich MP<br>National Party Education Spokeswoman</p>
<p>17 January 2007<br>Still too early to claim NCEA success</p>
<p>The release of the 2006 NCEA results to 136,000 New Zealand school students today should be a day of celebration or at least relief, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;The NCEA is New Zealand’s premiere academic award for school-leavers and, as such, today is a huge day for the students receiving their results.</p>
<p>&quot;National has long held concerns over NCEA and we still do.</p>
<p>“It is imperative that parents, students and future employers have confidence in NCEA and the standards it sets.</p>
<p>“Though we certainly believe improvements can be made, today is a time for students to reflect on their year’s work and, hopefully, celebrate their achievement.</p>
<p>“Though NZQA says the 2006 exams have run smoothly, and students can expect robust and reliable results, history shows such early claims of success are best reserved until parents and students have digested the results and viewed exam papers.”</p>
