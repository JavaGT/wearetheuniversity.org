<p>Think Positive For A Family-Friendly Workplace<br>15 January 2007</p>
<p>Back at work but with the kids still on school holidays, many parents are frantically juggling their work and family commitments. Yet new research shows not all of them are taking full advantage of family-friendly policies in the workplace, and that’s having a negative effect on their working environment.</p>
<p>Workplace practices such as flexitime, time off in lieu, paid parental leave and childcare subsidies are becoming more common as businesses compete to attract and retain valuable employees in a tight labour market. But research by Dr Jarrod Haar of the University of Waikato Management School shows that some employees are reluctant to make use of these options.</p>
<p>“We found some people – and it is the minority, about 10% of employees – feel a little bit guilty or dependent if they make use of flexitime or paid parental leave,” says Dr Haar, who carried out a study of more than 200 government workers. “Some also resent their co-workers taking advantage of these options.”</p>
<p>Negative feelings like these, says Dr Haar, lower job satisfaction and support, and can create a worse working environment for everyone.</p>
<p>“It’s the dark side of helping,” he says. “People think: ‘I don’t want to ask the boss for special treatment because I’m afraid it will damage my career’.” Working fathers are the worst at this, says Dr Haar. And he says there’s no easy answer to the problem.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to create a perfect system for everybody, and family-friendly policies in the workplace are very positive for the majority of employees. But it’s important that companies make sure they get the message out to supervisors and managers as much as to employees in order to raise awareness of these policies and improve communication.”</p>

<p>Dr Haar says managers need to be aware of employees’ feelings around family-friendly policies. “For example, they might need to find temporary cover for someone who’s on paid parental leave so that colleagues don’t feel resentful that they have to do extra work.”</p>
<p>However, it isn’t all doom and gloom, says Dr Haar. “We found employees with a positive mind set were able to override these negative feelings of guilt and dependence.”</p>
<p>A positive approach to family-friendly policies in the workplace, he concludes, will pay off in the form of increased employee satisfaction and a better working environment.</p>
