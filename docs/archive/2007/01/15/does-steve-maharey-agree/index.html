<p>Does Steve Maharey Agree?</p>
<p>The Education Minister needs to tell kiwis whether he backs the Teachers Council decision to allow an early childhood teacher involved in hitting toddlers and force-feeding them to the point of vomiting, to work again in the sector, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>“Kiwis will be disappointed and surprised if he thinks yes. Any parent asked if they would want their own preschoolers anywhere near an early childhood teacher who thought force-feeding, hitting and ignoring distressed toddlers was good practice, will give a resounding no!</p>
<p>“The Teachers Council decision to allow this teacher back into an early childhood centre with only a few provisos is disappointing. Requiring the teacher to do some additional training as penance is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>“To become an early childhood educator, teachers have had to do years of training.</p>
<p>“Force-feeding and hitting children is the antithesis of everything an early childhood educator learns in the years before they are allowed to teach.</p>
<p>Preschool children are the most vulnerable of students. They can’t fend for themselves. To have done such extensive training and still believe that force-feeding and hitting toddlers was good practice clearly indicates that this person is not suited to the profession.</p>
<p>“A few hours extra training will not overcome this teacher’s natural instincts, which lead her to believe that force-feeding to the point of vomiting was a good method of getting a child to eat, and that hitting or ignoring screaming toddlers was professional behaviour to have in her centre.</p>
<p>“How can the New Zealand public, and more importantly, the parents who use that centre be assured that hitting or force-feeding won’t happen again at the centre?”</p>
