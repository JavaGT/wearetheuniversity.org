<p>Maori Party urges a &quot;fresh look&quot; at Benefits</p>
<p>Dr Pita Sharples and Tariana Turia,<br>Co-leaders, Maori Party</p>
<p>Monday 29 January 2007</p>
<p>The co-leaders of the Maori Party have today called for a fresh look at the complex web of income support, meaningful work, decent wages and positive participation in society.</p>
<p>&quot;We have spoken out about issues which are critical concerns for the nation, and should be for every community&quot; said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>&quot;We would hope that as political parties meet to confirm their 2007 work programme, raising these issues may encourage them to also take a fresh look&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;A key issue is the unnecessary barriers created by restrictive eligibility criteria&quot; said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>To meet the Ministerial Eligibility criteria for Taskforce Green WINZ clients must be assessed as being both &#39;at risk&#39; of becoming long-term unemployed and disadvantaged in the local labour market</p>
<p>&quot;Our belief is that the only criteria should be that you are unemployed&quot; said Dr Sharples. &quot;In an economy which is supposedly &#39;buoyant&#39;, one would expect these benefits to flow to all New Zealanders, not just those &#39;at risk&#39;&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We are particularly concerned that while unemployment has dropped, the youth unemployment rate remains comparatively high compared with other population sub-groups&quot; said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>The Census figures record unemployment is still consuming 11% of the Maori workforce as opposed to a national average of 5.1%.</p>
<p>&quot;The story for income support is even more depressing, with 28% of Maori over 15 receiving a benefit, compared to 10.5% for the national average&quot; said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>&quot;The Maori Party will not countenance these sorts of statistics&quot; said Mrs Turia. &quot;Over the summer break, as we have been listening to our people, we see the faces and hear the realities of these statistics, and we will not be silent&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We are calling for a fresh look at the way in which we assist people to be productive, by working and participating in the society&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;To deny them the opportunity to work for a decent wage is a recipe for disaster&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the amount of the benefit should be raised to the minimum wage; and the work should be meaningful, productive and skill-enhancing&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Our key priority is in how society addresses the needs of school-leavers&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has insufficient places on their alternative education programmes, and we are aware that Maori school leavers are in a particularly dire predicament, given their over-representation in the number of students leaving school without qualifications&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;The proportion of our Maori students who leave school with qualifications higher than level one, is up to thirty percentage points behind other students&quot;.</p>
<p>In 2004, 74% of European and 87% of Asian students left school with qualifications higher than NCEA Level 1; compared to 47% of Maori students.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to be doing everything possible to ensure there are opportunities for our young people to be gainfully employed from the moment they drop out of the schooling system&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;And yet providers have told us they are being starved of funding, they are subsequently unable to employ qualified staff or provide a full range of opportunities, and as a consequence, their students miss out again&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government sets the cost per student - and as such - the crisis situation facing alternative education providers is a situation that they must address&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;When you consider the cost for the State to take care of these young people, one would have thought that the Government would have seen this as a key investment in these young people&#39;s future&quot; ended Mrs Turia.</p>
