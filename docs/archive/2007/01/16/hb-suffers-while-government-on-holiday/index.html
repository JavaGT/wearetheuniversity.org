<p>HB suffers while Government on holiday</p>
<p>National’s Horticulture spokesman, Craig Foss, is furious about the delay in finally declaring Hawke’s Bay as having a seasonal labour shortage under the Seasonal Work Permit Scheme.</p>
<p>“In November, I called for a shortage to be declared. I knew, growers knew, contractors knew and Pipfruit NZ knew that a shortage was again inevitable.</p>
<p>“Why did Work and Income wait so long? The result is that about 60 days have been lost to organise workers.</p>
<p>“Did the Labour Government think that thousands of willing and able local workers were going to magically appear in Hawke’s Bay between November and now?</p>
<p>“I look forward to the day when Government policy is focused on having Hawke’s Bay’s premium crop harvested, picked, processed and sold at the premium time.<br>“At present, growers have to plan around a Government bureaucracy that is impossible to align with the real world.</p>
<p>“The good news is that at least the shortage has been declared. The bad news is the unnecessary time pressure on the economy of Hawke’s Bay.”</p>
