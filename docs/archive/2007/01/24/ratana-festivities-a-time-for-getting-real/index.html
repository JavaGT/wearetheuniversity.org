<p>Ratana Festivities a Time for Getting Real says Turia</p>
<p>Tariana Turia, Co-leader of the Maori Party</p>
<p>Wednesday 24 January 2007</p>
<p>As Morehu throughout Aotearoa gather at Ratana Pa, Tariana Turia has recalled the impact of Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana, as a man of the people, who never lost sight of their real needs and values.</p>
<p>“Anyone who spends time at the Pa, whether in the tents or sharing kai, will be faced with the reality of our people’s lives” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“We remember the message of TW Ratana, that through upholding our spiritual beliefs and honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi, our people will advance”.</p>
<p>“And although the political rhetoric of the day has made considerable fanfare about how well we are doing, I think it is important to open our eyes to the reality of the situation for so many Maori”.</p>
<p>“I was interested in the analysis presented by Maori academic, Dr Rawiri Taonui, who has suggested that the hype around so-called increases in Maori earnings could hide real problems” said Mrs Turia. Dr Taonui&#39;s analysis is consistent with what we in the Maori Party find on a regular basis in our electorates.</p>
<p>While Census data reveals that the median income for Maori aged 15 years and over; is $20,900, Dr Taonui, Head of Canterbury University&#39;s school of Maori and Indigenous studies, has warned that an emerging Maori middle class may be hiding low working-class income amongst Maori people.</p>
<p>“We can not ignore, of course, the disparity between all other New Zealanders, who enjoy a median income of $24,400” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;And although there has been much talk of how well Maori are doing, it must be remembered that the median wage of $20,900 per annum for Maori equates to $10.04 per hour - which is still well less than the current minimum adult wage of $10.25 per hour&quot;.</p>
<p>“We are also extremely mindful of the persistent over-representation of Maori in health statistics such as diabetes; lung and heart disease; and life-expectancy which simply reflect the grip of poverty; the effects of economic violence upon living standards”.</p>
<p>“These ongoing statistics; our experience in greeting our people, door-to-door prior to the last election; our tours around the koata (the four quarters); all reinforce the importance of holding true to TW Ratana’s pledge, to work ‘mo te iwi Maori’, in order “that all may know that the Treaty of Waitangi is operative; also to preserve the ties of brotherhood between Pakeha and Maori for all time”.</p>
