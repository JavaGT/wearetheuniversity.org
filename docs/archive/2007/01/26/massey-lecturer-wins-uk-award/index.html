<p>Massey Lecturer wins UK Award</p>
<p>Massey researcher Dr Madhumita Bhattacharya is the inaugural New Zealand recipient of a Researcher Exchange Programme (RXP) award from British Council.</p>
<p>The award is designed to develop research links between the UK and other countries.</p>
<p>Dr Bhattacharya is a senior lecturer at the College of Education at the University’s Palmerston North campus. The funding will allow her to collaborate with Dr Jon Dron at Brighton University, England. Their research looks at online learning environments for multicultural audiences.</p>
<p>“The globalisation of education cannot be achieved without adapting resources to different cultural values and ways of thinking. The UK and New Zealand are similar in their multicultural make-up, which is why this collaboration has come about,” Dr Bhattacharya says.</p>
<p>This research area is particularly important for Massey, which has the largest number of extramural students in New Zealand. The area is also a priority research topic for the Tertiary Education Commission and its UK equivalent the Higher Education Funding Council.</p>
<p>British Council is the UK government’s agency for cultural relations. In total it awarded 70 grants to international researchers under this awards scheme. New Zealand researchers will be eligible to apply for the next funding round in mid-2007.</p>
