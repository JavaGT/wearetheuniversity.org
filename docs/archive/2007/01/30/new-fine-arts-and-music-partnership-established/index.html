<p>New Fine Arts and Music partnership established</p>
<p>New Zealand music and fine arts students will benefit from a new exchange programme with a leading British arts college.</p>
<p>The programme is being set up by Professor Matthew Marshall, who has been appointed to a one-year position as Acting Director of Music at Dartington College of Arts in Devon, England.</p>
<p>He has taken a year’s leave of absence from his position as Interim Co-Director of the New Zealand School of Music.</p>
<p>A wide range of artists have been attracted to Dartington over the years, notably tenor Peter Pears, musician Ravi Shankar, and composers Igor Stravinsky, John Cage, and Benjamin Britten.</p>
<p>Dartington offers five fields of study: music, theatre, art,choreography and writing. Students are able to combine study in more than one field and gain a broader understanding of contemporary arts practice and research.</p>
<p>Since his appointment in August last year, Professor Marshall has been involved in contextual enquiry project supervision, music performance and teaching, and cross-disciplinary performance. “The ability to work within and between different contemporary arts disciplines has a particular attraction for me,” he says.</p>
<p>“I’ve been fascinated by the fact that arts disciplines are often allowed to develop quite separately from each other, yet when they are combined, the creation of unique and novel concepts becomes possible.”</p>
<p>Professor Marshall says the student exchange programme will give fine arts and music students from each institution the opportunity to experience an alternative context for their development as artists.</p>
