<p>Signed by 150 government leaders at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the Convention on Biodiversity is the first global agreement on conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, and is part of the United Nations Environment Programme.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Ben Bell, Director of the Centre for Biodiversity &amp; Restoration Ecology in the School of Biological Sciences, will be spending time with Dr Djoghlaf.</p>

The Convention on Biodiversity is a major step towards protecting and improving our planet for the future.”</p>
