<p><strong>Tuesday, 30 January 2007, 10:15 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>All the world’s a stage—or at least the Botanical Gardens<br>(26/1/2007)</p>
<p>The Dell in Wellington’s Botanical Gardens will be transformed into the Forest of Arden in February, with Summer Shakespeare taking on As You Like It as its 25th anniversary performance.</p>
<p>Performed between Friday 2 February and Saturday 17 February, As You Like It is the story of love in all its guises in a rustic setting—although this production will place the characters in a setting more familiar to New Zealanders, says co-director, Jim Vilé.</p>
<p>“As You Like It is the most joyful Shakespearean comedy, which is beautifully suited to an outdoor setting. The play places urban characters in a rural environment to find love and fulfilment by escaping their town-based conflicts and tensions. This parallels the aspirations of large numbers of people today, who escape the stresses and strains of modern city living by going to the country.”</p>
<p>The tradition of Summer Shakespeare is sponsored by Victoria University and the Summer Shakespeare Trust, a dedicated group of theatre practitioners, administrators, and staff from Victoria University. Students from the University also feature in the cast.</p>
<p>The two accomplished directors, Jim Vilé and Sue Rider, have come from Brisbane to direct the play, one of the Bard’s best-loved comedies, and say it is a warm, fun piece of theatre that can be enjoyed by all ages.</p>
<p>Ms Rider says it’s also a play full of energy. “With songs, martial arts, disguises, mistaken identities and, of course, lovers, it’s a big, warm piece of theatre to bring a large cast together in a creative and enjoyable production, and entertain a wide audience,” says Ms Rider.</p>
