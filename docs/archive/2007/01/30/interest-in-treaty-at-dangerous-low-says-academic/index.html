<p>Interest in Treaty at dangerous low, says AUT academic</p>
<p>Public interest in the Treaty of Waitangi has plummeted in the last two years, says AUT University academic and leading Treaty expert Professor Paul Moon.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the millions of tax-payer dollars being poured into Treaty education, there has been an alarming drop in public concern with anything to do with the Treaty,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>By analysing references to the Treaty in the media and gauging the amount of public discussion on it, Professor Moon estimates that the past two years represent a new low in awareness of Treaty-related matters.</p>
<p>He puts this down to several reasons, including a failure by many to see any relevance in the Treaty, the lack of progress in settling the hundreds of outstanding claims, and what he terms the &quot;spectacular disinterest&quot; in the Government&#39;s recent Treaty road show.</p>
<p>&quot;We are possibly seeing the beginning of the end of the Treaty in the country&#39;s national life,&quot; warns Professor Moon. &quot;If New Zealanders do not see a purpose in the Treaty, then in just one generation it could disappear altogether from the national consciousness, and will be remembered afterwards solely as an historical agreement.&quot;</p>

<p>Paul Moon, MA (Hons), MPhil (Dstnct.), PhD, FRHistS, is Professor of History at AUT&#39;s Faculty of Maori Development, Te Ara Poutama. His specialist areas of research include the Treaty of Waitangi and the early period of Crown rule in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Professor Moon has published two best-selling books on the Treaty of Waitangi. He has also produced the biographies of Governors William Hobson and Robert FitzRoy, and the Ngapuhi chief, Hone Heke, and the ground-breaking book Tohunga: Hohepa Kereopa. He has also written a major biography of the Ngapuhi politician and Kotahitanga leader Hone Heke Ngapua (1869-1909), and wrote the best-selling Fatal Frontiers – a history of New Zealand in the 1830s. Future books include a history of New Zealand in the 1840s and a major work on Maori cannibalism.</p>
