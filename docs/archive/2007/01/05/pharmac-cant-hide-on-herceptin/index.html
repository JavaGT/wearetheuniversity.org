<p><strong>Friday, 5 January 2007, 12:17 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Dr Jackie Blue MP<br>National Party Associate Health Spokeswoman</p>
<p>5 January 2007</p>
<p>Pharmac can&#39;t hide on Herceptin</p>
<p>National Party Associate Health spokeswoman Jackie Blue is urging Pharmac to make a quick decision on funding of Herceptin for early stage breast cancer, in light of new evidence published today in the Lancet medical journal.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the evidence that the New Zealand authorities say they have been waiting for. Every week that passes is a lost opportunity for those who could benefit from taking this drug. And for those funding Herceptin themselves, every week that passes is another financial mountain to climb.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Blue, a former breast physician, says 23 OECD countries have funded Herceptin on the same evidence that Pharmac has been sitting on for the past year.</p>
<p>&quot;The findings published in Lancet demolish Pharmac&#39;s argument once and for all.&quot;</p>
<p>But Dr Blue says there are worrying comments in the Lancet Editorial that Pharmac could be looking at cheaper options.</p>
<p>There are suggestions that Pharmac is hoping a nine-week course of Herceptin used in the FinHer trial could be as effective as a 12-month course.</p>
<p>&quot;I sincerely hope that Pharmac is not seriously considering that Kiwi women should be guinea pigs for an unproven regime.</p>
<p>&quot;The FinHer trial had only a couple hundred women and the results weren&#39;t statistically significant. That&#39;s in complete contrast to the large scale HERA trials which involved thousands of women.</p>
<p>&quot;If money is really at the heart of this issue, I strongly welcome National Leader John Key&#39;s call for Labour to signal that funds are available if required. Pharmac&#39;s run out of excuses,&quot; says Dr Blue.</p>
