<p>Dr Paul Hutchison MP<br>National Party Tertiary Education Spokesperson</p>

<p>Labour Throws $8 Million At TEC Restructure</p>
<p>Plans for an $8 million restructure of the Tertiary Education Commission show the Government’s priorities on tertiary education lie in building bureaucracy, not quality learning institutions, says National’s Tertiary Education spokesman, Dr Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>In the January issue of the Education Review, the Tertiary Education Commission admits a planned restructure this year could cost $8 million.</p>
<p>The restructure will include recruitment for new positions, relocation of staff, redundancies, lease buyouts as a result of 10 area office closures, and the fitout of a national service centre in South Auckland.</p>
<p>This follows revelations the TEC blew its operational budget by $700,000 last year, but underspent the billions it distributes to tertiary education providers by $165 million.</p>
<p>“While the TEC has been overspending in running its bureaucracy, including spending $1.8 million on consultants last year, it has been underspending in its role of distributing funding to the tertiary sector.<br>“Now the Government is going to throw a further $8 million at the TEC in an attempt to get its bureaucratic creation to work.</p>
<p>“It reeks of something you&#39;d see on an episode of ‘Yes Minister’ as the commission has grown, expanded and bureaucratised.</p>
<p>“It just goes to show how ill-considered and poorly planned the creation of the TEC was in the first place.</p>
<p>“How can it be possible that within four years of being established, the TEC has now decided to shut 10 of its regional offices?</p>
<p>“When Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen talked about dealing with Labour&#39;s &#39;bums on seats policy&#39;, no one ever imagined he was planning to put more bums on more seats in office buildings in Wellington and Auckland.”</p>
