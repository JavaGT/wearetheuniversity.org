<p>Business as usual not good enough</p>
<p>NZQA needs to offer a better explanation to the students of Logan Park High School who are still waiting on results from NCEA exams, says National&#39;s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>Logan Park Principal Jane Johnson says one third of the school&#39;s NCEA papers had recorded &#39;result not available&#39; when students checked on the Internet yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;Today, NZQA tells us the results process is progressing &#39;business as usual&#39; and less than 1% of the 1.9 million results have been recorded as &#39;result not available&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Either Logan Park is incredibly unlucky to, according to reports, have one third of exam papers in that 1% or NZQA is trying to minimise this problem.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard to reconcile Logan Park&#39;s experience with the impression created by NZQA yesterday that marking had gone smoothly and students could expect &#39;robust and reliable&#39; results.</p>
<p>&quot;This problem has created unnecessary stress for teachers, students and parents who are still waiting on results.&quot;</p>
