<p>NZQA marking glitch needs investigation</p>
<p>Claims by a Dunedin school principal that NCEA results are still not available for almost a third of subjects offered at the school must be investigated, says National&#39;s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>Logan Park Principal Jane Johnson told the Otago Daily Times a third of the school&#39;s NCEA papers had recorded &quot;results not available&quot; when students checked on the Internet yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;NZQA claim this is a glitch and that marking went smoothly.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a typical NZQA response, but for the pupils left wondering what happened to their results, this is a serious and distressing error.</p>
<p>&quot;Many students are relying on these results as they plan their next year of study, and to be left in limbo simply isn&#39;t good enough.</p>
<p>&quot;NZQA claimed yesterday that &quot;most&quot; students would get their results online and promised that 85% would have received them in the mail by the afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly, this has not happened. For the sake of the teachers, students and parents left wondering, NZQA must immediately investigate the problem and issue an explanation.&quot;</p>
