<p>Paula Bennett MP<br>National Party Associate Education Spokeswoman (Early Childhood)</p>
<p>18 January 2007</p>
<p>Policy wrinkles need more than an iron</p>
<p>Education Minister Steve Maharey&#39;s plea for more time to sort out the issues of under-capacity for the Government&#39;s &quot;20 hours free&quot; early childhood education policy is too little too late, says National&#39;s Associate Education spokeswoman, Paula Bennett.</p>
<p>In response to the release of Official Information Act documents showing that 14% of early childhood services will not offer the scheme, and 47% will have &#39;little or no capacity&#39; to meet demand for the policy, Mr Maharey asked for time to &#39;iron out&#39; the issues.</p>
<p>&quot;He says parents and centres need more time to look through what is being offered.</p>
<p>&quot;A quick glance at the papers released by Mr Maharey&#39;s own Ministry will show any parent or centre that what is on offer can&#39;t be delivered as promised in 2005.</p>
<p>&quot;It is too late to plead for time to sort this policy 18 months after it was promised to parents.</p>
<p>&quot;Like the student loans bribe, this is another example of policy being developed on the hoof around a Labour Party election strategy table, not the usual official processes within the Ministry, which take time.</p>
<p>&quot;No amount of &#39;ironing&#39; will get rid of the wrinkles in this poorly planned policy.&quot;</p>
