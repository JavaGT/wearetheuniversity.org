<p>Katherine Rich MP<br>National Party Education Spokeswoman</p>
<p>06 May 2007<br>Govt negligent over college collapse</p>
<p>Continuing to dish out taxpayers’ cash to struggling company Case Boreham Associates in spite of clear warning signals about course quality and potential misuse of funds, is Government negligence in the extreme, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>“Labour Ministers, the Tertiary Education Commission and the New Zealand Qualifications Authority have some frantic explaining to do.<br>“Why did this company remain registered and keep receiving $1.2million per annum of public money despite tip-offs, complaints and damning official audits?</p>
<p>“The writing was on the wall about this organisation well before it finally went into liquidation, but Government organisations and Ministers failed to act.</p>
<p>“Such inaction begs the question - what does it take for the Tertiary Education Commission to pull funding, or for the Qualifications Authority to cancel registration?</p>
<p>“This should have happened well before it went into liquidation. Seeing the lineup of creditors, it’s most unlikely that taxpayers will get any money back.</p>
<p>“Government Ministers, including the previous Minister of Education, Trevor Mallard, have known for years about problems with the training organisation.<br>“The Ministers of Education and Tertiary Education need to explain why they did nothing to protect public money.</p>
<p>“The alarm bells within Government were so piercing that funding should have been cut well before the company finally went into liquidation.”</p>
