<p>Curiosity pays off for journalism graduate</p>
<p>A Massey journalism graduate has won the student print journalist prize at this year’s Qantas Media Awards.</p>
<p>Jenny Macintyre collected her award at a gala dinner in Wellington on Friday (May 18).</p>
<p>The prize included $500 from the Journalists Training Organisation, the industry body that oversees the training of journalists in the country.</p>
<p>“Journalists are curious, and I think I won because my curiosity found me stories,” Ms Macintyre says.</p>
<p>She submitted a portfolio of four stories written while a student at Massey, including one on the effects of Agent Orange on New Zealand Vietnam War veterans and another on Maori concerns over an exhibit at a local museum.</p>
<p>“I’m particularly proud that all four of my stories were picked up by other news media,” she says.</p>
<p>A student in 2006, Ms Macintyre paid tribute to Alan Samson, the Massey lecturer she worked most closely with during her time at the University.</p>
<p>“What I learnt from him is that for a story to be good you must rewrite, rewrite, rewrite!”</p>
<p>As a mature student, she says taking a year out of her life to study was a big decision, but one she is glad she made.</p>
<p>Her determination to do well on the course meant she soldiered on even after breaking her wrist just before the second semester started.</p>
<p>She now works as a reporter at the Sunday Star-Times in Auckland.</p>
<p>Other recent Massey graduates also did well at the Qantas Awards. Yvonne Tahana (class of 2003) won the Maori issues newspaper feature writer category and Kimberley Rothwell (2004) was a finalist in the junior newspaper feature writer category.</p>
