<p>Communications &amp; marketing specialist takes key role at Victoria</p>
<p>Respected communications and marketing specialist Helen Morgan-Banda has been appointed to a new strategic role as Victoria University’s Director, Communications &amp; Marketing,</p>
<p>Ms Morgan-Banda, who has previously been Communications Manager for the Prime Minister’s Office, Head of Communications &amp; Government Relations for New Zealand Lotteries, and Director Marketing &amp; Communications for New Zealand Police, will start at Victoria on June 5.</p>
<p>In this new role, that brings the University’s Public Affairs and Marketing teams together into a new Directorate, Ms Morgan-Banda will be responsible for Victoria’s advertising, corporate and recruitment publications, internal and external communication, media relations, alumni relations, event management and website management, including the MyVictoria web portal.</p>
<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor David Mackay, said Ms Morgan-Banda’s wide experience and knowledge would be invaluable as the University worked through the challenges posed by the Government’s changes to tertiary funding.</p>
<p>“Helen is a highly experienced communications and marketing professional with strategic experience across both public and private sectors.</p>
<p>“In a capped funding environment where the Government wants to enhance student retention, we need to carefully manage enrolments. As well, Victoria has set itself a strategic objective of significantly increasing the proportion of postgraduate students to enhance its culture as a research-intensive university. Helen’s experience in communications and marketing will be vital as Victoria traverses this complex terrain.</p>
