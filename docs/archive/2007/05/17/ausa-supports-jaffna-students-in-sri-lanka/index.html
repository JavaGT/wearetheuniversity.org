<p> <br>Auckland University Students Association (New Zealand) Supports Jaffna Students in Sri Lanka</p>
<p>The Student Representative Council (SRC) of the Auckland University Students Association (AUSA) has voted to support the boycott action of the University of Jaffna and Jaffna school students in Sri Lanka.  
 </p>
<p>Two motions were put forward to the SRC by Nirupa George the Media Liaison Officer for Tamil Youth Organization New Zealand (TYONZ).    Before the motion was put forward she spoke about the boycott, explaining the issues facing the students in Jaffna and how although New Zealand was halfway across the world, it is important to recognize human rights for the Tamil students involved and for fellow tertiary students to support each other.</p>
<p>The motion put forward by the chair &quot;That AUSA supports the actions and intentions of the students and staff involved in the Jaffna University and schools boycott and that AUSA believe the students have a right to express their opinions and views without the threat of violence or death&quot; was carried.</p>
<p>A second motion of &quot;That AUSA write a letter to those involved in the protest expressing our (AUSA) support for their boycott&quot; was also passed.</p>
<p>About 150 Auckland University students attended SRC.</p>
