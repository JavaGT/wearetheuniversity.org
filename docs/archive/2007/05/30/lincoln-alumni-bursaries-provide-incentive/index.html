<p>Lincoln Alumni Bursaries Provide Incentive For Mid-Year Start</p>
<p>Press release, 28 May, 2007, Lincoln University, New Zealand: Starting a degree or diploma course mid-year opens up a range of opportunities for anyone considering a change of career, re-training or simply starting out on the tertiary education trail.</p>
<p>Undergraduates starting courses at Lincoln University from July 2007 will for the first time be eligible for the newly announced Alumni Bursaries for mid-year entry.</p>
<p>Each bursary is worth up to $2,000 which makes a significant dent in fees for the year, and students from all over New Zealand and overseas are eligible to apply.</p>
<p>Application forms for the Alumni Bursaries are available through the Lincoln website <a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/scholar">www.lincoln.ac.nz/scholar</a> and must be received by 7 June, 2007. Second semester study begins on 2 July 2007.</p>
<p>Lincoln&#39;s Alumni Association manager Sarah Currie says the intention of the mid-year bursaries is to give encouragement to those who may be considering gaining a qualification and don&#39;t wish to wait until the new university year in 2008.</p>
<p>&quot;Lincoln has a great selection of courses that are available for mid-year entry in subjects as diverse as software and IT, property valuation, hotel management, environmental management and landscape architecture ,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Emerging from a degree course in the middle of the year can also be a great boost to gaining immediate employment instead of joining the crowd of graduates looking for work at the end of the academic year.</p>
