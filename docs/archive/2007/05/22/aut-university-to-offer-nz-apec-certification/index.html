<p>AUT University to offer New Zealand APEC certification</p>
<p>New Zealandbusiness advisors who counsel Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs) have received a boost with APEC endorsed certification now being offered through AUT University.</p>
<p>The Centre for Executive Education, part of the AUT Business School,was nominated by the Ministry of Economic Development to manage, deliver and assess nationwide APEC-IBIZ training and certification.</p>
<p>APEC-IBIZ is the APEC-linked International Network of Institutes of Small Business Counsellors. It assists with the provision of high quality, professional counselling services throughout the Asia Pacific region by offering training and certification to its members.</p>
<p>Certified APEC-IBIZ counsellors and professional consultants are able work with SMEs in any Asia Pacific economy to encourage competitiveness in an increasingly global market.</p>
<p>AUT is the only New Zealand-based Economy Institute licensed by IBIZ to provide the small business counsellor programme.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Development says it chose AUT because of its record in ‘delivering quality training across New Zealand’ and ‘its enthusiasm for taking on the role’.</p>
<p>AUT’s Centre for Executive Education provides tailored business programmes for executives, professionals and organisations.</p>
<p>The Centre’s aim is to develop professionals who add value and lead change in their organisations and their communities, says Centre director Dr Geoff Perry.</p>
<p>“We’re focussed on designing learning programmes to suit any individual’s and organisations’ specific business needs,” he says.</p>

<p>“This is from managers starting an MBA, to the APEC-IBIZ certification, to sporting groups that want to provide players or support staff with tertiary level qualifications.”</p>
<p>He says the APEC-IBIZ programme will develop counsellors with expertise in leading small business clients to becoming effective business managers.</p>
<p>The Centre currently co-ordinates executive programmes for national and international organisations including for ANZ Bank, National Bank and the Vodafone Warriors.</p>
