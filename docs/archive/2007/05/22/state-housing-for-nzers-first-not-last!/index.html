<p>State Housing For New Zealanders First - Not Last!</p>
<p>New Zealand First wants the Housing Minister to explain why immigrants are being allocated State houses ahead of New Zealand citizens.</p>
<p>Housing spokesperson Pita Paraone today released figures showing the numbers of non-New Zealand citizen applicants granted a State house over the past three years:</p>
<p>2003/04: 1444, 2004/05: 1481, 2005/06: 1508.</p>
<p>Mr Paraone pointed out that New Zealand takes a total of 750 refugees each year and that the Minister stated today that only 150 refugee families were housed in 2005/2006.</p>
<p>“That leaves 1358 migrant families, who presumably arrived under points systems, being granted State houses while thousands of New Zealand families wait on a list.</p>
<p>“We don&#39;t dispute the needs of genuine refugees but we do question the fairness of a situation where immigrants, who are supposed to have passed the test of their worth to our country, being allocated State houses while New Zealanders wait. The Minister thinks that a permanent resident is a New Zealander but the last time I checked a New Zealander had not only residency but citizenship as well.”</p>
<p>Mr Paraone says that Housing New Zealand does not record the citizenship status of current occupants of its properties.</p>
<p>“Officials only record it at the time of application. It is never revisited. They don&#39;t actually know how many foreigners live in subsidised State housing at any one time.</p>
<p>“There are more than 11,300 families currently on the waiting list for State housing. Why should desperate New Zealanders wait while migrant families are housed first?”</p>
<p>“From the Minister&#39;s response in the House today it appears that any migrant can go into a State house after two years – ahead of Kiwis who have lived here all their lives,” said Mr Paraone.</p>
