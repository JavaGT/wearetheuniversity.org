<p><strong>Tuesday, 22 May 2007, 3:27 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Tony Ryall MP<br>National Party Health Spokesman</p>
<p>22 May 2007</p>
<p>Fewer people getting specialist health care</p>
<p>Fewer people are getting appointments with hospital specialists despite billions of dollars of extra health spending, says National&#39;s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>Answers to written questions show there were 28,000 fewer specialist appointments in 2006 than in 2001, the first calendar year for which records are available.</p>
<p>During that time the health budget increased 66% to more than $4billion.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite all that extra money, fewer people are getting to see a specialist and fewer people are getting operations,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;Fourteen out of the country&#39;s 21 DHBs are providing fewer specialist appointments than in 2001. The biggest falls are in Auckland (-11%), Capital Coast (-20%), Taranaki (-15%) and Whanganui (-23%).</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest drop-off is with people wanting to see a specialist to qualify for elective surgery. The fact is that despite all the Labour Government&#39;s promises, it&#39;s harder to see a specialist and even harder to get an operation.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is making it harder to see a specialist so it can suppress hospital waiting lists.</p>
<p>&quot;Patients will laugh at Pete Hodgson&#39;s claim that the country is so much healthier that people don&#39;t need more visits to specialists. Tens of thousands of people referred to specialists have been denied an appointment...ask any GP.</p>
<p>&quot;What patients do care about is how many more of their tax dollars are going into health to buy more care, yet it&#39;s harder to get into the system.&quot;</p>
