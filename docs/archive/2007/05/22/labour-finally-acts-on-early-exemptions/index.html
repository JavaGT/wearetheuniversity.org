<p>Labour finally acts on early exemptions</p>
<p>Labour is finally listening after National raised concerns about the number of exemptions being granted to students to leave school before they turn 16, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>In answer to a parliamentary question, Education Minister Steve Maharey has admitted that his Ministry is now reviewing their processes for approving early leaving exemptions, with the aim of reducing the number of exemptions granted.</p>
<p>“The number of secondary students being granted exemptions has increased by 43% since 1999.</p>
<p>“In 1999 some 2,802 students were granted exemptions, and by 2006 this had risen to 3,957.</p>
<p>“Leaving school early leads to poor outcomes later in life, and until National highlighted this alarming trend, Labour had been silent on the issue.</p>
<p>‘The Ministry is currently granting 95% of all applications for early leaving. Our school leaving age is higher then the OECD average.</p>
<p>“If all of these students were leaving to take up apprenticeships or sustainable work then we would not have an issue, but the fact is many are lured away to do flimsy courses and end up in the dole queue.</p>
<p>“It is great that the Ministry of Education is now moving to address the problem, but it is concerning that it took a doubling of the numbers between 1997 and 2006 to get some action.”</p>
