<p>Students making it easy to be green</p>
<p>Now that the debate is over and climate change has been acknowledged, what do we do next? To raise awareness about this and other environmental issues, AUSA is hosting EcoFest in the University of Auckland Quad from Tuesday May 15th to Friday May 18th.</p>
<p>EcoFest is a festival dedicated to increasing awareness of the environment and ways we can protect it, among students and the wider community.</p>
<p>EcoFest 2007 is the vision of AUSA Environmental Affairs Officer Hannah Spierer. &quot;This year&#39;s theme is all about making it easy to be green&quot;, says Spierer. &quot;Being &#39;green&#39; is easier than most people think and it&#39;s not just for hippies… it&#39;s hip to be pro-active and environmentally conscious.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is inspiring to see so many students and the wider community getting actively involved in making this festival happen. It shows that if we all make individual efforts then, collectively, we can achieve great things.&quot;</p>
<p>EcoFest will culminate with an environmentally-friendly fashion show at 12pm on Friday May 18th. Lovingly referred to as The EcoFashMash, the show will showcase organic denim and merino wool pieces from local label Untouched World; original designs from Waitakere City Council&#39;s &#39;Trash to Fashion&#39; awards and Waiheke Island&#39;s &#39;Junk to Funk&#39; awards; and a range of recycled and pre-loved clothing from local op-shops and mother&#39;s wardrobes. The EcoFashMash will excite and inspire with creative designs and real models, under the art direction and guidance of Jasun from INOCHI Styling<br>&amp; Photography, with hair and make-up by the Cut Above Creative Team.</p>
<p>And to top off a full day, the EcoFest Party in the University of Auckland Quad is a come-one, come-all celebration of the environment and our place in it. Boasting a vibrant and eclectic range of musicians and DJs, including indie-favourites The Dilletantes, Brazilian drumming sensation AK Samba and the charmingly gypsy-folk ensemble The Benka Bordofsci Bordello Band.</p>
<p>EcoFest officially opens at 10:30am, Tuesday May 15th with a stirring Kapa Haka in the University of Auckland Quad, followed by a vegetarian-versus-meat-eating debate that has the Greens On Campus and the Meat Club getting all hot under the collar. Over the four days of the festival there will be events, stalls, and presentations from a wide range of non-governmental organisations and eco-friendly businesses, all showing you how it&#39;s easy to be green.</p>
