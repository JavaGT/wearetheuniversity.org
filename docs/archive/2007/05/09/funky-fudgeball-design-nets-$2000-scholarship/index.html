<p>Funky “FudgeBall” design nets $2000 scholarship</p>
<p>Designs for a silicon sink plug and a “FudgeBall” funky correction tape dispenser helped industrial design student Blake Richardson win this year’s Macdonald Scholarship.</p>
<p>Mr Richardson, 20, received the award on the Wellington campus yesterday. It was presented by its sponsors, geophysicist Peter Macdonald and his wife Doris.</p>
<p>The award, worth $2000, is given annually to a third-year School of Design student majoring in Industrial Design who has achieved high academic and technical standards in year-two of their studies.</p>
<p>Mrs Macdonald has extensive connections with the tertiary education sector and Mr Macdonald a strong interest in the development of New Zealand design and technology. In 1995 they established a trust fund to provide the scholarship.</p>
<p>“We particularly wanted the scholarship to support high achieving students during the middle stages of their degree studies,” says Mr Macdonald.</p>
<p>Mr Richardson designed a range of products including a silicone sink plug, perfume bottle, and FudgeBall, a “funky” correction tape dispenser. He thanked Mr and Mrs Macdonald, described the award as “awesome” and said he would invest the money in his further studies.</p>
