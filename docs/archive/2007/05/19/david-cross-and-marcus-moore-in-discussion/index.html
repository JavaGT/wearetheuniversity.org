<p>EXTREME PARTICIPATION</p>
<p>David Cross and Marcus Moore in discussion</p>
<p>Wednesday 23 May<br>5.30 pm<br>Followed by closing celebration drinks for Hold</p>
<p>10A02 Lecture Theatre<br>(via main entrance)<br>Old Museum Building<br>Massey University<br>Wellington</p>
<p>Participation is conditioned by the situations we find ourselves in, as well as the situations and environments that are constructed for participation. Art history demonstrates that extremes in performance and installation have been pivotal to defining avantgardism. In fine arts and visual culture today the extension of extreme is found across a wide spectrum. Models of participation are prevalent across popular culture, with our thresholds for engagement constantly being pushed to further extremes. What now is the successful extension of extreme in performance and installation and the will to engage and embody the extreme? To participate to find a limit, or depth as a pure and unmediated experience; or a phenomenon as entertainment already over the edge?</p>
<p>Marcus Moore and David Cross will discuss the Performance/ Installation Hold next Wednesday May 23, 5.30 pm, Main Lecture Theatre 10A02, Old Museum Building, Massey University, Wellington.</p>
<p>Hold currently runs until Sunday May 20th, 2 – 8 pm daily.</p>
<p>Litmus presents this significant new work by Cross - a large-scale performance/ Installation examining the fluid divide between our experience of pleasure and fear by juxtaposing the visual and sensory languages of minimalism, pop and the body with that of children’s recreational structures. Through suggesting the possibility of radically transforming the audience’s experience of the art/entertainment divide, Hold turns from performance to sculpture to spectacle as it considers a number issues to do with architectural space, performance art, participation and aesthetics.</p>
