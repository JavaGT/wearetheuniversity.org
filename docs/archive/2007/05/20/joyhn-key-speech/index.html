<p>John Key MP</p>
<p>Leader of the National Party</p>
<p>20 May 2007</p>
<p>National’s Agenda</p>
<p>Speech to the Canterbury-Westland Regional Conference,</p>
<p>Hamner Springs</p>
<p>It&#39;s a real pleasure to be addressing the Canterbury-Westland Regional Conference as Leader of the National Party.</p>
<p>It&#39;s good to be joined today by eight caucus colleagues from this region, half of whom were new to Parliament at the 2005 election. Congratulations are due to those MPs and the voters and volunteers who helped get them elected. This line-up is proof that the National Party is in great heart.</p>
<p>I am hugely proud to be leading this wonderful party of ours. It’s a privilege to be your leader.</p>
<p>The National Party is built on age-tested principles that reflect what is best about New Zealand. We are a party of enterprise; a party of personal freedom and individual responsibility; a party of family; an inclusive party; a party of ambition.</p>
<p>We believe in every individual&#39;s capacity to shape their own life, and we believe in this great country of ours. New Zealanders from all walks of life make National what it is and we take strength from our diversity.</p>
<p>Today, I would like to thank every member and volunteer here who helps make this party strong. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the work of National Party Regional Chair Roger Bridge, and Party President Judy Kirk.</p>
<p>The efforts of our members are what keep us vibrant; keep us connected and make us heard. So, thank-you.</p>
<p>I am excited about what lies ahead for us and I have a crystal clear message for all of you: National is absolutely committed to winning the next election. And the one after that. And the three after that!</p>
<p>We have the drive. We have the fresh ideas. We have the people. And we have more Kiwis behind us than any other party in this country.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, I am determined to lead National to Government in 2008. I am determined to serve all New Zealanders with the strength, the courage and the energy that they deserve.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, we must be determined.</p>
<p>The mission before us</p>
<p>A great mission lies before us.</p>
<p>New Zealand is at a critical juncture in its history. Big winds are blowing in our direction.</p>
<p>The explosion of the Internet is bringing billions of potential customers within our reach.</p>
<p>Our booming and ever-wealthier Asian neighbours are reaching out for new services and new products. People everywhere are seeking safe and green havens in an increasingly unstable and dirty world.</p>
<p>New Zealand is uniquely placed to respond to these global forces.</p>
<p>We need to harness the opportunities they bring and ensure every Kiwi can use them to build a better life.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll tell you what won&#39;t work. It won&#39;t be enough to simply chant slogans of</p>
