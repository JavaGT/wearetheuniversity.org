<p>Pansy Wong MP<br>National Party Associate Education spokeswoman</p>
<p>1 May 2007</p>
<p>TEC confirms scam claim - and there may be more</p>
<p>The Tertiary Education Commission has admitted they now have information that backs claims of alleged scams being run by the St George Institute of Learning and possibly other education providers.</p>
<p>National&#39;s Associate Education spokeswoman Pansy Wong revealed that the St George Institute of Learning was still offering cash kick-backs to students after the TEC investigated and the commission&#39;s CEO, Janice Shiner, promised she would look into the serious allegations.</p>
<p>&quot;A letter received from the commission today admits further information has come to light about St George. The CEOs of NZQA, TEC and Study Link will meet tomorrow to agree on a plan of action to investigate &#39;areas of concern&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;This just confirms my assertions that the original inquiry was nothing short of a whitewash.</p>
<p>&quot;Janice Shiner also admits in today&#39;s letter that agencies are now undertaking inquiries at tertiary education organisations with similar profiles to St George, which backs up our evidence that the scams were not confined to the one private education provider.</p>
<p>&quot;I look forward to the results of a comprehensive inquiry into these scams, which have cost the taxpayers millions of dollars.&quot;</p>
