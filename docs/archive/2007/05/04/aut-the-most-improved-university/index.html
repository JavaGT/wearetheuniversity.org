<p>AUT the most improved university</p>
<p>AUT University has shown the biggest improvement in research quality score of any university in the PBRF results announced today by Tertiary Education Commission (TEC).</p>
<p>Since the last PBRF survey in 2003, AUT has improved its research quality score by 141.6 per cent.</p>
<p>AUT has also more than doubled the number of staff members who have been assessed as research active.</p>
<p>AUT Vice Chancellor, Derek McCormack, says he is &quot;very satisfied&quot; with the rate of improvement, which is a little higher than forecast and confirms that the future of AUT&#39;s research capability is in no doubt.</p>
<p>&quot;Our research development strategy is working well and is fundamental to AUT&#39;s pursuit of excellence,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Increasing research activity, he explains, will further enhance the high quality of the university in other areas where it already leads the New Zealand university sector, such as graduate employment, successful student completion rates and growth in enrolments at both bachelor and postgraduate levels.</p>
<p>In line with some of the most progressive new universities overseas, AUT places emphasis on developing a culture in which the integration and application of research and learning are defining characteristics, says Professor Ian Shirley, AUT&#39;s Pro Vice-Chancellor, Research and Commercialisation.</p>
<p>&quot;The university has developed a strong reputation for integrating research into activities that improve local, regional and national outcomes, while also reinforcing those clusters of research activity in which AUT has considerable expertise,&quot; says Professor Shirley.</p>
<p>The PBRF results show AUT performing well in many discipline areas, including accounting and finance; marketing; design; and sport and exercise science.</p>
