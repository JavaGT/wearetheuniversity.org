<p><strong>Friday, 4 May 2007, 3:21 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Teaching Excellence Needs Investment As Well</p>
<p>Students today welcomed the release of the partial Performance Based Research Fund (PBRF) round however warn that funding of teaching needs to keep pace with the funding of research.</p>
<p>“It is important that excellence in research is encouraged but a lack of investment is currently working against teaching excellence in our Tertiary Institutions,” stated Joey Randall, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.</p>
<p>“Students have continuously been expected to pay ever increasing fees while government investment has sadly lagged behind. Relying only on students to bridge this gap is a failed strategy than simply reduces access and burdens graduates with mounting levels of debt.”</p>
<p>“Greater public investment is needed in order to ensure excellence in tertiary teaching and ultimately the high quality graduates that New Zealand needs.”</p>
<p>“The tertiary reforms will not deliver greater quality and relevance for students and their communities if public investment in teaching is not increased,” concluded Randall.</p>
