<p>University of Canterbury’s research excellence recognised</p>
<p>The number of A-graded researchers at the University of Canterbury has increased by more than 25 percent and the University is ranked first or second in six subject areas in the latest Quality Evaluation of the Performance Based Research Fund.</p>
<p>The University is ranked number one in the following subject areas: Engineering and Technology; Other Health Studies (including Rehabilitation Therapies); and Foreign Languages &amp; Linguistics.</p>
<p>UC is ranked number two nationally in the subject areas Philosophy; Molecular, Cellular and Whole Organism Biology; and Earth Sciences.</p>
<p>UC also has the highest proportion of new and emerging researchers awarded funded quality categories of any university in the country.</p>
<p>The results announced today show that Canterbury University’s average quality score has risen from 3.83 in 2003 to 4.10 in 2006 (the year in which the assessment was conducted). On that basis UC is ranked third overall nationally. The top three universities have scores of between 4.10 and 4.22.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Sharp says in addition to the significant increase in A-graded researchers, there have been increases in the number of B and C graded researchers. There has also been a 22.95 percent decrease in the number of R grades.</p>
<p>“I am very pleased with these improvements. They reflect not only quality research, but also the investment the University has made in the PBRF process.</p>
<p>“Our inclusion in the top three, which all have very little between them, and our first or second placings in six subject areas, endorses our belief that the University of Canterbury is a research leader.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the University I would like to congratulate our staff on their achievements.”</p>
