<p>TEC needs to spell out scam probe</p>
<p>National Party Associate Education spokeswoman Pansy Wong wants to know how the Tertiary Education Commission is set to re-investigate tertiary education providers cleared of running illegal scams last year.</p>
<p>“I’m pleased that the TEC is finally taking this matter seriously, but I plan to seek assurances from chief executive Janice Shiner about the nature of the probe.”</p>
<p>Last month, Mrs Wong provided information to the TEC about alleged cash kick-backs being offered as incentives to students who enrolled at St Georges Institute in Auckland. The information included statements from former students.</p>
<p>“For the public to have confidence in this fresh inquiry, we need to be provided with the terms of reference, the expected time frame and the resources that will be devoted to it.</p>
<p>“Remember, TEC supposedly investigated these scams last year and St George Institute, among others, was given a clean bill of health after a short visit and agreeing to sign a declaration.</p>
<p>“If all the new investigation does is repeat the same mistakes, it will be a pointless exercise,” says Mrs Wong.</p>
<p>Last year the TEC investigated complaints against 13 institutes for offering cash incentives.</p>
<p>“It’s not good enough to say the practise has stopped. We need to know how much taxpayer money was wasted and what efforts will be taken to recover the cash.</p>
<p>“There will also need to be some serious questions of anyone who provided false or misleading information to TEC the first time around.”</p>
<p>Mrs Wong notes that the TEC does not want to comment about the precise nature of the inquiries, such as the who and the how.</p>
<p>“But telling us how that inquiry will progress and when we’ll get some answers is not too much to ask, I would have thought.”</p>
