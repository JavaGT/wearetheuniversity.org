<p>Increased University Funding A Good Start</p>
<p>The Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) welcomed today’s pre-budget announcement by the Minister of Tertiary Education, Dr. Michael Cullen, that funding to Universities will increase by $129 million over the next four years.</p>
<p>OUSA President Renee Heal said the announcement showed that the government recognises the importance of increased funding to Universities. “Any increase in government funding of Universities is obviously a positive step,” she said. “It is important, however, that this funding is recognised when it comes to setting student fees. Students should directly benefit from an increase in government funding through a zero increase in fees.”</p>
<p>OUSA also believes that while the increased government funding to Universities is positive, the government still needs to do more. “An increased commitment to University funding must also be an ongoing commitment. Similarly, the government must address its support for students while studying. An increase in access to student allowances must be the government’s next step.”</p>
