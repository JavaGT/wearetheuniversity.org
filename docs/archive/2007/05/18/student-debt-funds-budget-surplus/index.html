<p><strong>Friday, 18 May 2007, 10:03 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Student Debt Funds Budget Surplus</p>
<p>Students are disappointed that the Government hasn’t used its significant surplus to meet its election promise of meaningfully increase support to students.</p>
<p>“Students have been waiting too long for meaningful increases in student support from Labour”, stated Joey Randall, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).</p>
<p>“The total number of students receiving an allowance has dropped by 20% between 2000 and 2005. That is a drop in government funding of allowances of $79 million dollars. It is no wonder that student debt continues to increase as more and more students are force to borrow in order to pay rent and by food.”</p>
<p>“Additional funding increases of $28.9 million in all forms of student support is still going backwards.”</p>
<p>Labour promised last election that they would ensure that 50% of full time students would receive allowances; it is currently less than 30%.</p>
<p>“NZUSA is calling on government to honour its manifesto pledge of 50% access to student allowances.” concluded Joey Randall, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).</p>
