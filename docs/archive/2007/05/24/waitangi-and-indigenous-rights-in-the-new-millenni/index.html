<p><strong>Thursday, 24 May 2007, 10:20 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_Press">Auckland University Press</a></strong></p>
<p>Waitangi and indigenous rights in the new millennium</p>
<p>Emeritus Professor Jock (FM) Brookfield will discuss the recently published new edition of his book, Waitangi and Indigenous Rights: Revolution, Law and Legitimation (AUP) which deals with revolutionary constitutional change, and discusses how the revolutionary taking of power by one people over another can be legitimated. Professor Brookfield’s book considers how to deal with the wrongs done to those taken over, which must be redressed partly by new constitutional arrangements. In this context, he will consider some recent work in Maori and Waitangi matters of Bill English, Jane Kelsey, Paul McHugh, Ani Mikaere, Ranginui Walker, David Williams and others.</p>
<p>Jock Brookfield was in law practice in Auckland before his appointment to the Faculty of Law in 1966. He taught there until his retirement at the end of 1993, becoming a Professor in 1985. He is a former Dean of the Faculty. He has published widely in constitutional law and in land law and conveyancing.</p>
