<p>Hone Harawira - The Budget and the Treaty</p>
<p>Setting a Budget might seem like a mammoth task, but it ain’t really, and neither should it. It’s simply a reflection of a government’s priorities in its management of the nation’s affairs.</p>
<p>Sadly the last few budgets confirm the fact that this government has little respect for the Treaty and for treaty rights, and has no genuine regard to the health, education and employment needs of Mâori. In a land where the Treaty is called the founding document of our nation, this progressive downgrading of Mâori funding is a chilling message to all New Zealanders who care about justice.</p>
<p>So here are a few thoughts about how government might have targeted funding to Mâori to address treaty rights, reduce disparities, and save millions of dollars currently being wasted by bureaucratic nepotism.</p>
<p><strong>Treaty</strong></p>
<p>The Treaty has been the source of much discontent. Appoint a Treaty Commissioner to promote the Treaty as the basis for a positive future, and let’s get on with the real problems in society.</p>
<p><strong>Budget Review</strong></p>
<p>Open the books to see how much money is actually being spent on social rescue programmes for Mâori and what results are being achieved. Taxpayers deserve to know, and Mâori are sick of being blamed for departmental incompetence.</p>
<p><strong>Unbundle the Funding</strong></p>
<p>John Tamihere got blasted by Labour for daring to say that social problems are managed better by communities than by bureaucrats, but he was right. Community control of social funding generates far better returns for society than the bloated social budgets Labour uses to control people’s lives.</p>

<p><strong>Education</strong></p>
<p>If it’s true that kura kids do well, than why is government cutting off funding to Mâori language teachers? Put 1000 new Mâori language teachers into the game, and remember, successful students become successful citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Unemployment</strong></p>
<p>Statisticians confirm that most social problems come from Mâori on the dole, so why doesn’t government focus on reducing Mâori’s current dole level of 36%? Targeted funding and positive support will definitely reduce Mâori unemployment.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong></p>
<p>**<br>Mâori die from diabetes so much that we call the Diabetes Ward up at Whangarei Hospital the “Maori Ward”. Diabetes treatment is costing the country tens of millions every year. Focusing on programmes to reduce diabetes in Maori will enhance society, reduce inequality, and save the country millions every year.**</p>
<p><strong><strong>Conclusion</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Folks – budgets aren’t rocket science. They’re about priorities. The Mâori Party’s priorities are people. Unfortunately, Labour’s budget promises of corporate tax cuts suggest their priorities lie elsewhere.</strong></p>
