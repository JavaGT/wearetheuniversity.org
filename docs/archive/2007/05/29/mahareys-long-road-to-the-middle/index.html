<p>Maharey&#39;s Long Road…To The Middle</p>
<p>Heather Roy<br>Tuesday, 29 May 2007<br>Press Releases - Education</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Heather Roy today demanded that Education Minister Steve Maharey quit encouraging school students to reach the truly dizzying heights of mediocrity.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s &#39;highly anticipated&#39; announcement is little more than the Government tinkering with an education system that puts huge emphasis on burdensome assessment while leaving teachers with too little time to teach,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;Education is not &#39;one size fits all&#39;. The NCEA changes announced today show that mediocrity is all that Labour wants for our young people - but I&#39;ll warrant that the nation&#39;s parents want more for their children.</p>
<p>&quot;It is for this reason that I am calling for real changes in education, and for internationally-recognised assessments - such as Cambridge, IB - to be made accessible to all students around New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand children don&#39;t need extra credits for Merit achievements; they don&#39;t need increased moderation; they don&#39;t need tinkering with a system that encourages them to be merely average - rather, New Zealand children need choice and diversity.</p>
<p>&quot;If the NCEA really is the wonder system that Labour claims, then we should be able to see how it stands against other education regimes - regimes that encourage excellence and push students to perform to the best of their ability,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
