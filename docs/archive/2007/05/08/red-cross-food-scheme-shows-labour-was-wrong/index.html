<p>John Key MP<br>National Party Leader</p>

<p>Red Cross food scheme shows Labour was wrong</p>
<p>The Red Cross’s announcement today of a breakfast in schools programme shows how wrong Labour was to criticise National’s drive to make sure children in low decile schools don’t go hungry, says National Party Leader John Key.</p>
<p>“I announced National’s plans for a Food in Schools programme during my State of the Nation speech at Burnside in January.</p>
<p>“Helen Clark criticised the speech and claimed an underclass didn’t exist.</p>
<p>“But National is committed to providing practical solutions to problems which Helen Clark says are a fiction. One of those problems is supplying food to students who arrive at some of our schools hungry.</p>
<p>“As I said in the speech, it’s a fact that kids can’t and don’t learn if they are constantly hungry.</p>
<p>“After the speech I got approaches from various companies and other organisations, and I decided that National wouldn’t wait to do something positive about this problem and match food offers with needy schools.</p>
<p>“Today’s announcement by Red Cross is another example of the community approach to this issue that I was advocating. The Red Cross scheme has been trialed at two schools in Manukau and is now going nationwide to all decile one primary schools which don’t already have a food scheme.</p>
<p>“The Red Cross says about 10% of children show up for classes without having eaten, and some are famished on a Monday because they haven’t eaten anything all weekend.</p>
<p>“Our kids deserve better, and I applaud the Red Cross’ approach.</p>
<p>“In government, National will be backing just such programmes.”</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
