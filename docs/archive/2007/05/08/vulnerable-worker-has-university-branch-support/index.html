<p>Vulnerable Worker has University Branch Support</p>
<p>Monday, 7 May 2007</p>
<p>Tuesday the 8th of May will see the Otago University Branch of the New Zealand Labour Party taking action against Subway because of Subway’s treatment of its former employee, Jackie Lang. The branch is co-ordinating a protest outside the George Street Subway to express their concern to Subway management and raise the media profile of Ms Lang’s situation. The protest will begin on the University Union Lawn at 12pm, before marching to the Subway restaurant on George Street.</p>
<p>The George Street Subway recently dismissed Ms Lang for sharing a soft drink, to which she was entitled, with a friend during her break. Subway then laid criminal charges for the theft of the drink.</p>
<p>“I’m disappointed that any employer would treat their workers like this, especially over a matter this trivial, which could have easily been resolved internally,” said Otago University Branch President Ashley Murchison.</p>
<p>The Otago University Branch has prioritised action on this issue because it constitutes a local example of a vulnerable worker being treated unfairly. “It’s important to take a stand on injustices that happen in our own backyard; Dunedin cannot stand by and let our workers be treated like this,” said Ms Murchison.</p>
<p>Earlier today Young Labour called for a nationwide boycott of all Subway restaurants. This is especially important in Dunedin where the injustice took place. Ms Murchison added, “We have to send a message to employees that they have rights, and that employers cannot get away with unfair treatment of workers.”</p>
