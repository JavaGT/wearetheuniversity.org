<p>A Special One-Off Screening of the Fair Trade Documentary Black Gold:</p>
<p>Thursday 10th May, 8:30pm, at the Academy Cinema</p>
<p>The Fair Trade Association and the Green Party Present &quot;Black Gold&quot;<br>As part of Fair Trade Fortnight (28 April - 13 May), The Fair Trade Association of Australia and New Zealand (FTAANZ) and the Green Party are co-hosting a special one-off screening of the compelling documentary Black Gold</p>
<p>Black Gold is a persuasive and sobering investigation of the world coffee trade, from the hype and glitz of the World Barista Championships to the Ethiopian farmers who grow the world’s finest coffee beans yet live in near starvation. The film follows the travels of Tadesse Meskela, manager of the Oromia coffee co-operative which represents more than 70,000 Ethiopian coffee farmers, as he searches for a fairer price for coffee.</p>
<p>Followed by a Panel Discussion: The 78 minute film will be followed by brief talks and a Q &amp; A session with fair trade advocates, including FTAANZ&#39;s overseas guest speaker Will Padilla from a Costa Rican fair-trade collective. Other speakers include the Chairman of the Ethiopian community in Auckland Zenebe Tsega; Green MP Nandor Tanczos, Barry Coates from Oxfam, as well as other special guests.</p>
<p>A locally produced short documentary called &quot;A Bean to Pick: a Fair Trade Chocumentary,&quot; made by young Auckland school students, will screen before the main feature.</p>
