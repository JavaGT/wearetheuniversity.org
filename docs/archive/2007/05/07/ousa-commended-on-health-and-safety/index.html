<p>OUSA Commended on Health and Safety</p>
<p>The Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) has been awarded a Judges’ Commendation Award at the New Zealand Workplace Health and Safety Awards. Held on May 1st at the Sky City Convention Centre in Auckland, the Awards recognise excellence in workplace health and safety standards and procedure. From over 100 entrants in ten categories, 30 were picked as finalists.</p>
<p>There were three South Island finalists in the competition including representatives from Christchurch, Invercargill and Dunedin. OUSA was a finalist in the “ACC Thinksafe Best Leadership of an Industry or Region” category. Six representatives from OUSA travelled up for the event and were very pleased to be presented with a Judges’ Commendation Award.</p>
<p>OUSA President Renee Heal is extremely proud of the organisation’s accomplishments. “This is a fabulous achievement,” she said, “which recognises the many steps OUSA has made towards becoming more focused on health and safety. It is a real honour to receive this recognition.” Heal credits OUSA staff member Natasha Mason for the award. “Natasha has worked so hard to ensure we are a health and safety conscious workplace, and she really deserves this recognition.”</p>
<p>OUSA is very happy with their achievement in the NZ Workplace Health and Safety awards this year and would also like to thank Cath Logan from the University of Otago for her assistance in the early stages of OUSA’s setup.</p>
