<p>Former Kerikeri High School Dux and Head Boy David Middlemiss has been selected as the Girdlers’ Scholar for 2007, a prestigious award regarded as the undergraduate equivalent of the Rhodes Scholarship which will see him attend Cambridge University.</p>
<p>David has an outstanding academic record to date, including achieving the equivalent of an entire NCEA level one certificate of 80 credits at excellence level. He was one of only three Kerikeri High School students to be awarded academic honours for NCEA level two, achieving 103 credits at excellence level. At NCEA level three, David was awarded an outstanding scholarship in geography. He was top scholar for six out of his seven years at Kerikeri High School and competed with distinction and high distinction in Australasian science, mathematics, chemistry, English and computing competitions.</p>
<p>Community problem solving is a particular interest for David and he achieved first place in the senior division of the 2006 International Community Problem Solving Conference held in Colorado. He also received an outstanding coach award as a result of his team’s performance at the same event. David was one of three Kerikeri High students who helped to establish an NCEA course for senior problem solving programmes, working with Ministry of Education and NZ Qualifications Authority officials to develop a teaching and assessment kit.</p>

<p>In 2006 David was the only Kerikeri High student to achieve an honours award across three criteria – academic, cultural and leadership. He received a double award for academic, a triple award for cultural (debating, writing and public speaking) and a double award for leadership (problem solving coaching, head boy).</p>
<p>While David describes his real passions as debating and community problem solving, he also enjoys tramping, swimming and fencing, both as a competitor and coach. An avid reader who enjoys writing, David has worked in community problem solving teams addressing such issues as protecting cultural heritage sites and developing an innovative reading programme at Kerikeri High. Both of these projects won grand champion awards at the international finals.</p>
<p>When he goes to Cambridge later this year, he intends to study law, focusing on international and commercial aspects, with a view to future career possibilities in international relations and trade.</p>
<p>The Girdlers’ Scholarship – worth more than 18,000 pounds sterling - is administered by the NZ Vice-Chancellors’ Committee and funded by the Girdlers’ Company, a British organization with its origins in livery but which now focuses on charitable causes and property ownership. David is the 43rd Girdlers’ Scholar, a fact which underlines the lengthy connection between the company and this country.</p>
