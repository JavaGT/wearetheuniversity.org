<p><strong>Monday, 7 May 2007, 3:32 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology">Auckland University of Technology</a></strong></p>
<p>Idealog magazine, the innovative new business title published by AUT Media, was named Business Magazine of the Year, at the New Zealand Magazine Awards on Friday May 4.</p>
<p>Idealog was also awarded Magazine Launch/Relaunch of the Year.</p>
<p>The annual event is organised by the Magazine Publishers&#39; Association. Idealog was a finalist in five categories including business magazine, launch/relaunch, designer, cover and website of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;This is fantastic acknowledgement of our idea for a new kind of business magazine,&quot; says co-founder Vincent Heeringa. &quot;Launching a magazine is a terrifying experience, especially when you are pioneering new ground. There are no rules, just a passion for filling a gap in the market, which Idealog certainly has.&quot;</p>
<p>The judges clearly agreed, commenting, &quot;from its launch, this publication incorporated multiple media platforms to deliver its content to readers with a well-planned and well-executed launch strategy, targeting a well-defined audience.&quot;</p>
<p>Idealog is successfully reaching an audience as diverse as artists and aeronautical engineers. &quot;The link between our readers is their determination to commercialise their ideas – so the magazine is being picked up and read by anyone who has a passion for Kiwi creativity, innovation and enterprise,&quot; says Heeringa.</p>
<p>In awarding Idealog Business Magazine of the Year, the judges commented that Idealog displays &quot;a clever model for a business magazine. It is well-executed with innovative presentations and feels like an advocate for its readers.&quot;</p>

<p>The magazine also runs a growing website and together with AUT University and the Trans-Tasman Business Circle is launching the first of a speaking and networking Innovation Series on May 17.</p>
<p>AUT Media Idealog is the first product to come from AUT Media, the new publishing arm of AUT University.</p>
<p>&quot;AUT is justifiably proud of this award for Idealog,&quot; says AUT University Vice Chancellor, Derek McCormack. &quot;The magazine stands out for its fresh take on business, encouraging New Zealanders to embrace both creativity and commerce.</p>
<p>&quot;In that sense Idealog mirrors the thinking in AUT&#39;s Business School about the need for innovation in business. It also reflects the establishment of our faculty of Design and Creative Technologies, which incorporates such seemingly diverse disciplines as fashion and graphic design on the one hand, and applied mathematics and engineering on the other.&quot;</p>
<p>AUT Media was established in August 2005, with activities ranging from print management and design services for the University, through to magazine and book publishing.</p>
<p>The first two books in AUT Media&#39;s book publishing programme will be released in August.</p>
<p>AUT Media is managed under contract by HB Media, a company founded and owned by Vincent Heeringa and Martin Bell.</p>
<p>Launch support Idealog won Launch of the Year thanks to its commercial success from day one, with an unprecedented amount of advertiser and reader support.</p>
<p>&quot;Much of that success came down to the support of our sponsors, who we would like to thank and acknowledge,&quot; says co-publisher Martin Bell.</p>
<p>Idealog&#39;s 2007 sponsors are Baldwins, Image Centre, and Telstra Clear.</p>
<p>Its launch sponsors also included Telecom and Microsoft.</p>
<p>&quot;Without the commitment of AUT University and our sponsor partners, Idealog could not have achieved this level of commercial success and recognition in such a short space of time. We are extremely grateful for their continued support.&quot;</p>
