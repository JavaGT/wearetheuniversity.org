<p>Annual Report highlights student and staff achievements</p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington’s 2006 Annual Report highlights a year of achievements by staff, students and alumni.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh, said the Report, recently tabled in Parliament and available on the internet, outlined a diverse range of accomplishments.</p>
<p>“A good example that drew together all the elements of research, teaching and community service has been the issue of climate change. From the international conference, the University organised to the well-attended seminars and publications that have followed and the active critiquing of Government policy by our academic staff, they have all given real meaning to our statutory obligation to be the ‘critic and conscience’ of society.”</p>
<p>Professor Walsh said the high standing of the University’s teaching was recognised again when, for the fifth year in a row, Victoria featured in the National Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards.</p>
<p>“This year, Dr Warwick Murray, from the School of Geography, Environment &amp; Earth Sciences, was honoured, the seventh award the University has received. Other significant awards include Professor Peter Barrett, Director of the Joint Antarctic Research Institute, a significant collaboration with GNS Science, receiving the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research’s prestigious President&#39;s Medal for Outstanding Achievements in Antarctic Science. He was also named The Dominion Post Wellingtonian of the Year.”</p>

<p>Several staff also received New Zealand Honours for their achievements.</p>
<p>Professor Walsh said the Report showed that, excluding the New Zealand School of Music, the University became an institution of more than 21,000 students for the first time, with an increase in equivalent full-time students to 16,650.</p>
<p>However, while Victoria’s revenue increased, expenditure also increased and the University alone only achieved a surplus of about $4 million, which equates to just 1.6 percent of total revenue, he said.</p>
<p>“We are implementing a series of initiatives to ensure that the University has the funding needed to continue to enhance services and facilities for students and staff and to meet the challenges of the Government’s tertiary education funding reforms.”</p>
