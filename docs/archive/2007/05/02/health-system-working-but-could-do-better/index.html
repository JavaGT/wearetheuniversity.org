<p>Health System Working - But Could Do Better</p>
<p>New Zealand’s public health system is working but could do very much better says New Zealand First’s health spokesperson Barbara Stewart.</p>
<p>“After a year of strikes which have cost health boards millions of dollars and disrupted thousands of patients and the lab tests debacle in Auckland the Minister is obviously determined to look on the bright side when he says that most people remain confident in the health system because of their own positive personal experiences.</p>
<p>“Only the wealthy have the option of not having to rely on the health system so we are mostly a captive audience.</p>
<p>“However it is obvious to most New Zealanders that the health system would work better if accountability was restored to its proper place - the elected Government rather than unelected district health board officials – and bureaucracy was substantially reduced.</p>
<p>“A first world country with a population of 4.1 million should have a health system which rates more than 5½ out of 10,” said Mrs Stewart.</p>
