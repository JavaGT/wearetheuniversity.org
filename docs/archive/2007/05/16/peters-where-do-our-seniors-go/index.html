<p>Peters: Where Do Our Seniors Go?</p>
<p>An address by Rt Hon Winston Peters to the Whakatane District Grey Power Association on Wednesday 16 May in the Reception Room at the Whakatane War Memorial Hall on Short Street at 2pm</p>
<p>While there has been a lot of publicity in recent years about the so-called brain drain of our young people to Australia and beyond, there is also a similar, if somewhat smaller, corresponding phenomena among our seniors.</p>
<p>You see for the last five years more that two thousand seniors a year have permanently left our shores to enjoy their retirement in other parts of the world – many across the Tasman in Australia.</p>
<p>In total the figure is close to 15,000 seniors who have left our shores permanently, or the equivalent of one of our provincial towns.</p>
<p>Now we can understand why our young people go to pursue the bright lights, higher wages and exciting opportunities of the world. (Although we really would like them to stay).</p>
<p>We can even understand why hundreds of thousands of our seniors travel on short term visas to see the world.</p>
<p>In fact we would encourage them to do so.</p>
<p>But why would 15 000 New Zealand seniors see fit to move permanently from New Zealand – their homeland.</p>
<p>For some it is the fact that their grandchildren are elsewhere.</p>
<p>For others it is a belated OE.</p>
<p>Some just want warmer climates.</p>
<p>But sadly, for far too many it is because seniors get treated better in Australia, Europe and in other destinations.</p>
<p>What a tragedy – that some feel they must leave their homeland to get dignity in their retirement.</p>

<p>There is a further dimension to this travesty which is increasingly taking root.</p>
<p>You see not only are far too many of our seniors living on the border of poverty but when they turn on their TVs they are bombarded with images of gang violence, dysfunctional youths terrorising neighbourhoods and exploding P labs.</p>
<p>What makes this worse is that this is all occurring in many of our streets and neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>It is not the ghettos of New York, London or Sydney – this degenerate violence is right here in our backyards.</p>
<p>This in itself is reason enough to leave permanently.</p>
<p>For far too long these issues have been in the too hard basket.</p>
<p>When it came to raising the living standards of seniors it was always too expensive. You see, to many politicians seniors are part of what they call &quot;the non-productive sector&quot;.</p>
<p>They ignore the huge amount of voluntary and unpaid work you do which is often the glue holding families and communities together.</p>
<p>They ignore the massive contribution you have made already to society and the obligations we have to ensure our seniors can retire in dignity.</p>
<p>What they really want to achieve is the most minimal standards and cheapest options they can get away with.</p>
<p>When it comes to addressing gangs and violence sadly many politicians run up the too hard flag.</p>
<p>We saw it last week. Party leaders saying how hard it is to deal with gangs.</p>
<p>That is why gangs prosper – they know that the powers that be lack the intestinal fortitude to make the really tough calls when it comes to gangs and violence.</p>
<p>Well there is one party in parliament which isn&#39;t afraid to put a few noses out of joint and make tough decisions.</p>
<p>There is one party which has been prepared to stand alone and offer the policy solutions that others find too hard.</p>
<p>That party is of course New Zealand First.</p>
<p>You see we want to help you in your quest to create a decent society for your retirement.</p>
<p>And we believe there are three steps in the transition to the decent society we all seek.</p>
<p>The first relates to providing the fundamentals of an assured quality of life.</p>
<p>The second relates to building the foundations of a decent society built on mutual respect and propriety.</p>
<p>The third relates to empowering those who have the ability to make real change to do so.</p>
<p>So the first question must be – what is New Zealand First doing to improve the fundamentals which ensure a quality of life for our seniors?</p>
<p>Or put another way – what has New Zealand First actually delivered to seniors?</p>
<p>This is a valid question – and one worthy of a thorough answer.</p>
<p>The first place we look when we consider quality of life is the basic income.</p>
<p>On this front New Zealand First ensured that the base rate of New Zealand Superannuation for married couples was raised from 65% to 66% of the Net Average Wage.</p>
<p>So, in real terms, what difference has the increase to 66% of the Net Average Wage made?</p>
<p>Well from 1 April this year married couples received an increase of $20.00 a week.</p>
<p>Singles got between $12 and $13 – depending on their living circumstances.</p>
<p>This increase would not have been as high had the base rate remained at 65%.</p>
<p>These are real gains by the only party truly committed to our seniors.</p>
<p>And remember this – there is no guarantee that other parties won&#39;t take this gain away from you following the next election unless New Zealand First is there to protect it.</p>
<p>That’s right – they will set the rate back at 65%, or even 60%, so all your gains will be lost.</p>
<p>In fact there is only one party in parliament committed to systematically increasing New Zealand Superannuation over time.</p>
<p>So the next question is how do we make this increased income go further?</p>
<p>August will see the launch of the SuperGold Card for seniors.</p>
<p>This is a huge step forward in improving the lives of seniors.</p>
<p>Not only will government subsidies and discounts be available on the card, but a wide range of negotiated commercial discounts.</p>
<p>This really matters.</p>
<p>For those wanting more detailed information, a freephone number 0800 25 45 65 is in place to address your concerns.</p>
<p>The legislation has now been passed by parliament.</p>
<p>Now to clarify some of the misinformation which some backward thinking MPs have been promoting regarding the card and the possibility of micro chipping in the future.</p>
<p>The simple facts are these.</p>
<p>A clause relating to microchiping was included in the legislation because we know that by the end of this year banks and retailers will be moving to this technology replacing magnetic strips and barcodes.</p>
<p>So we chose to future proof the card so that it will be fully functional as technology changes.</p>
<p>Unlike some – we know our seniors are not techno phobic, they know how to use and embrace new technology as it comes along.</p>
<p>We also ensured that safeguards are in place, such as having the Privacy Commissioner and the State Services Commission consider the technology before it is implemented.</p>
<p>We would never expose our seniors to the negative effects of changing technology.</p>
<p>The irony of all of this is that banks and retailers are moving to this new technology because it is more, not less, secure than magnetic strips and barcodes.</p>
<p>But rather than get weighed done by the stupidity of others, we in New Zealand First would rather focus on the positives.</p>
<p>We are working to ensure that we see some real action on the portability of overseas pensions after years of obfuscation.</p>
<p>From clarifying Section 70 of the Social Security Act through to fundamental changes to the administration of these policies, there will be significant developments.</p>
<p>The Budget has also seen another massive increase of $400 million in funding for the eldercare sector.</p>
<p>In fact New Zealand First has ensured that not only is there substantially more money – but that many of the structural problems plaguing the sector are being addressed.</p>
<p>As a result, we hope to see a significant boost in wages for those working in this sector on top of the general improvement in the provision of these services.</p>
<p>New Zealand First has also ensured that the minimum wage is increasing to $12 an hour by 2008, which has a flow on effect for superannuation and ensuring that our businesses and exporters have the right incentives to grow the economy.</p>
<p>The question then shifts to how can we build a decent society.</p>
<p>The first port of call on this front must be law and order.</p>
<p>New Zealand First is on track in ensuring that we meet our commitment of 1000 more police which will make our streets safer.</p>
<p>We are the party prepared to put our money where our mouths are on gangs and to outlaw them as the criminal organisations that they are.</p>
<p>To those who say that it is to hard to stop the gangs, we say give us the tools and watch us do it.</p>
<p>Will some toes get trampled on and will some sensitivities be offended? Probably.</p>
<p>But for too long now it has been our toes and our sensitivities that the gangs have trampled all over.</p>
<p>To those who believe talking nicely to gangs will make any real difference we say – you had your chance to go straight and you blew it when you killed that little girl.</p>
<p>You blew it when you stabbed each other in court last week.</p>
<p>You blew it when you continued to trade in drugs and prostitution.</p>
<p>You blew it when you encouraged your youth to fight and intimidate others.</p>
<p>So our message to you is clear.</p>
<p>We know who you are and after the 2008 election we will be coming for you.</p>
<p>So the next question must obviously be how do you empower those who can make a real difference?</p>
<p>In a democracy you are limited by the mandate the people give you.</p>
<p>In 2005 New Zealand First only received a limited mandate.</p>
<p>It is something New Zealand&#39;s senior citizens should consider very carefully before 2008.</p>
<p>You will get what you vote for.</p>
<p>If you want more of what we have – then you need to put your vote where your voice is.</p>
<p>Seniors have a choice.</p>
<p>They can consolidate the gains that have been made for them and secure more, or they can put it all at risk.</p>
<p>It is your choice – so choose carefully.</p>
<p>You will get what you vote for and only one party is prepared to do more than just pay lip service to your concerns.</p>
<p>Only one party sees and hears you concerns and actually does something about them.</p>
<p>Only New Zealand First has the track record like no other of delivering for seniors.</p>
<p>The question is – do you want to play Russian roulette or do you want to deal with a known quantity?</p>
<p>Let us be clear.</p>
<p>More votes will mean more policy wins.</p>
<p>If you want a better quality of life; if you want the scourge of gangs dealt with; and your streets safer, then only one party has the track record and the courage to deal with these issues.</p>
<p>It is this simple.</p>
<p>At the last election one in six seniors voted for New Zealand First.</p>
<p>If two out of six seniors had voted for us, then you would be receiving even higher superannuation.</p>
<p>If three out of six, or half of all seniors, had voted for us then not only would you be getting increased superannuation, but issues such as non-qualified spouses and some of the technicalities surrounding the superannuation formula would have been resolved.</p>
<p>We would also have the ability to deal directly with gangs.</p>
<p>If four or five out of six of you had of voted for us, then not only would you have received all of the above, but we would have been able to pursue policies such as removing GST off petrol and other policies which would lighten the load for all seniors.</p>
<p>Your priorities would become the government&#39;s priorities.</p>
<p>Seniors need to start thinking now about 2008.</p>
<p>We want to ensure that our seniors have no reason, aside from the weather perhaps, to leave New Zealand permanently.</p>
<p>This is your homeland and we want to see you retire in dignity here.</p>
<p>That is why we are called New Zealand First.</p>
<p>It is a name we intend to live up to.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
