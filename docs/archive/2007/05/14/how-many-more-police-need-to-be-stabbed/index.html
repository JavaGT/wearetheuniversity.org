<p>Chester Borrows MP<br>National Party Police Spokesman</p>
<p>14 May 2007</p>
<p>How many more police need to be stabbed?</p>
<p>How many more police officers have to be stabbed before the Labour Government starts working harder to get stab-resistant vests to frontline officers?</p>
<p>That&#39;s the question being asked by National MP Chester Borrows, following today&#39;s stabbing of a Hamilton police officer.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a relief that the officer&#39;s injuries were not serious, but how long before something the Minister writes off as an operational matter becomes a matter of life or death?</p>
<p>&quot;According to media reports the officer had been measured for a stab-resistant vest, but was still waiting for it to arrive.</p>
<p>&quot;Police officials say only 40% of frontline officers in Waikato have vests.</p>
<p>&quot;The police officer stabbed four times last week was one of three officers at the scene. Only one had a vest.</p>
<p>&quot;Isn&#39;t there now a danger that criminals will target non-vest wearing officers?</p>
<p>&quot;Frontline police were first promised the body armour by June last year and they&#39;re still waiting.</p>
<p>&quot;Police Minister Annette King has said that &#39;By the end of July 2007, it is anticipated that 95-98% of response staff will have stab-resistant body armour issued&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Police officers should not be kept waiting for this protection.&quot;</p>
