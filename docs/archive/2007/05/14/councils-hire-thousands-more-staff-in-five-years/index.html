<p><strong>Monday, 14 May 2007, 8:28 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Councils hire thousands more staff in five years</p>
<p>National Party Local Government spokesman John Carter says Labour “buck-passing” is partly to blame for an explosion in ratepayer-funded staff at councils.</p>
<p>Reports today, say local body wage bills have soared by 50% in five years and the number of people employed by councils rose by almost a third.</p>
<p>“That’s in line with my own calculations based on census figures, which show there were 31,407 people employed in local government in 2001, compared to 38,874 at the 2006 census.”</p>
<p>This represents an almost 24% increase over five years, just short of the 28.7% rise reported in today’s ‘Sunday Star Times’.</p>
<p>“Labour has forced local authorities to beef up their numbers in order to deliver on the dozens of pieces of legislation that have loaded costs on to ratepayers.”</p>
<p>Mr Carter says it is hard to reconcile the build up of extra staff, with the long delays associated with the processing of resource consent applications and planning approvals.</p>
