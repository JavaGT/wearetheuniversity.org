<p>Internationally renowned New Zealand sculptor Paul Dibble will receive an Honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts at Massey University graduation ceremonies in Palmerston North this week.</p>
<p>Dibble has a comprehensive history of making large-scale bronze sculptures and has had his works commissioned both nationally and overseas. His most recent is Southern Stand, the New Zealand Memorial at Hyde Park, dedicated by the Queen on Armistice Day last year, and attended by Prime Minister Helen Clark, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and members of the Royal Family.</p>
<p>The memorial commemorates the long relationship between New Zealand and Britain and is dedicated to the New Zealand people and Culture.</p>
<p>From 1977 - 2002 Dibble lectured in art at the College of Education while also keeping up his own artistic practice. His studio employs art assistants and foundry technicians from a range of backgrounds, many from Massey’s Maori Visual Arts degree, which has courses at masterate level and is the only university art school in Palmerston North.</p>
<p>Mr Dibble received his art training at Auckland University at the Elam School of Fine Arts and has worked with notable artists including the late Colin McCahon, who was his tutor.</p>
<p>His sculpture is seen by many as a voice that expresses an identity uniquely New Zealand. The concerns and concepts he explores in his art are ones that belong to this land.</p>
<p>Sculptor Paul Dibble will receive an Honorary Doctorate at Massey University graduation ceremonies in Palmerston North on 17 May at 9.30am</p>
