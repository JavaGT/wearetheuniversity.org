<p>Nuclear Veterans should be compensated</p>
<p>The Green Party is calling for veterans who participated in Operation Grapple to be compensated for genetic damage, and for their children to be tested to see if genetic damage has been passed on.</p>
<p>&quot;The Massey study released today has confirmed what veterans have long suspected - namely that they incurred long term genetic damage as a consequence of their exposure to hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific in 1957.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time for the government to acknowledge the suffering, adverse health effects and long term genetic damage these veterans have incurred as a result of their participation in Operation Grapple. They deserve an official apology from the government, and compensation for the suffering they have endured,&quot; Ms Kedgley says.</p>
<p>&quot;The government must also agree to their request that their children are tested as well, to see if genetic damage has been passed on.</p>
<p>&quot;If this is done, we can begin to put this sorry saga behind us. Otherwise it will continue to haunt the veterans and their children.</p>
<p>&quot;The New Zealand Nuclear Test Veterans Association has been campaigning for decades for recognition of the long term damage they have sustained as a result of their participation in Operation Grapple,&quot; Ms Kedgley says.</p>
