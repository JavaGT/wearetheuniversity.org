<p>Monday, May 14, 2007<br>Pricks and blood from the lost generation</p>
<p>Public relation students are appealing to the lost generation for blood.</p>
<p>There will be plenty of pricks and bloody good laughs at an event run by students to help boost the number of blood donors.</p>
<p>Every week, 340 donations are needed in Wellington, and this target is not being reached. With the support of the NZ Blood Service, public relations students are running an event aimed at educating others about the importance of donating blood.</p>
<p>Just 5 per cent of New Zealanders donate blood but more than 80 per cent will need blood or blood products during their lives.</p>
<p>Comedians Cori Gonzalez-Macuer and Jamie Bowen will entertain students as registered nurses prick fingers to test iron levels and blood type.</p>
<p>Public relations student Riarna White, understands that not everyone will donate.</p>
<p>“There is no pressure to donate on the day. We just want students to understand and acknowledge the lifesaving quality of blood and consider becoming a regular donor.”</p>
<p>Kay Carthew, a donor recruiter from the NZ Blood Service describes students as the “lost generation” due to a lack of blood donations from this age group.</p>
<p>She suggests this could be due to their sometimes erratic lives and the possible inadequacy of understanding the importance and need for blood donors.</p>
<p>The event will be held on Wednesday 16 May, between 11.30am – 1.30pm at Tussock Bar and Cafe, Massey University, Wellington.</p>
<p>The NZBS will collect blood donations on 22 May at the University.</p>
<p>The event is organised by public relations students as part of their course work requirement, in order to prepare for event management and communication roles in a public relations career.</p>
