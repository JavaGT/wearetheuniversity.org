<p>Media Statement</p>
<p>Benefits in the Bay- going, going, gone!</p>
<p>3 May 2007</p>
<p>Unemployment levels in Hawke’s Bay continue to plummet, Labour MP Rick Barker said today.</p>
<p>“While there have been outstanding results in getting unemployment benefit numbers down right across the Bay, a couple of figures are extraordinary,” says Rick Barker.</p>
<p>“In March this year there were only 6 people on the unemployment benefit in Flaxmere, compared to 1019 people in 1999 when Labour became the Government. This is an amazing achievement which blows me away.</p>
<p>“But things have got even better. As at April 27 no one in Flaxmere was registered as unemployed. Not one person! It’s hard to comprehend, but it’s true, and it’s fantastic.</p>
<p>“And in March this year there were only 5 young people across the whole of the Bay on the unemployment benefit. No one under 20 in Taradale, Hastings and Flaxmere were on the dole.</p>
<p>“Instead of languishing on benefits our young people are in work or are learning new skills through tertiary education.</p>
<p>“One of the worst things National did in the nineties was scrap apprenticeships so it’s great to see that nearly 400 young people in Hawke’s Bay are taking part in the Modern Apprenticeship scheme.</p>
<p>“A major reason people are moving from dole payments into jobs is that Hawke’s Bay’s economy has been humming along – it’s grown 35% since 1999. This is 10% more than the New Zealand economy as a whole.</p>
<p>“But credit also needs to go to the dedicated team of Work and Income case managers who&#39;ve been very active in moving people from benefits into work. The challenge now is to keep people in work as seasonal jobs come to an end. I am pleased to say so far, so good,” said Rick Barker.</p>
