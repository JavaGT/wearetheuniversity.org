<p>Dr Paul Hutchison MP<br>National Party Tertiary Education Spokesman</p>
<p>3 May 2007</p>
<p>Another ‘fail’ in Govt’s education results</p>
<p>The Tertiary Education Commission’s (TEC) admission that the Performance Based Research Fund (PBRF) report has been delayed until tomorrow marks another milestone of mucked-up education results under the Labour Government, says National’s Tertiary Education spokesman, Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>The report was due early this week and TEC claims an ‘oversight’ has led to the delay. It affects 468 tertiary education staff and the TEC says the mistake is ‘regrettable’.</p>
<p>“TEC admits the delay could potentially affect the overall score for some subject areas and where they are ranked.</p>
<p>“Under former Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey, the TEC was plagued with mess, inaccuracy and poor value for money.</p>
<p>“It is most unfortunate that the TEC has made this mistake in the PBRF because of its huge importance to tertiary staff and the institutions they work for.</p>
<p>“The Labour Government is clearly tired as it lurches from the error-plagued NCEA fiasco to this latest mess-up.</p>
<p>“The TEC’s ‘apology’ to the affected tertiary staff will mean as little as any apology to students whose careers have been blighted by being guinea pigs in the Government’s NCEA experiment.”</p>
