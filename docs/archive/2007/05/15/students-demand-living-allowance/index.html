<p>Students Demand Living Allowance</p>
<p>“Universal living allowances for all students will be on the agenda for 2007 and 2008”, explained VUWSA Campaigns Officer Tai Neilson.</p>
<p>“We have had unequivocal support from students on the issue of living allowances for all students.” In a random sample of around one hundred students at the Kelburn and Te Aro campuses, 82 percent of students claimed they supported the initiative.</p>
<p>“We asked students whether they believed all domestic students should be eligible for a living allowance and the responses were overwhelmingly yes.” VUWSA is taking this as a mandate from the students.</p>
<p>In the last election students fought for interest-free student loans and gained a political victory. This year “students need to start applying the pressure so that we can move forward in 2008,” claimed Neilson.</p>
<p>The loan system as it is drives student into more and more debt, into worse accommodation and into working even more part-time hours. This is particularly harmful for Maori, Pacific Island and female students who often take considerably longer to pay off student debt.</p>
<p>VUWSA is currently starting the campaign drive and Neilson says he wants to hear from students about the issue. “Student involvement is paramount. We want to hear your stories because that’s what it takes to get student issues back on the election agenda.”</p>
