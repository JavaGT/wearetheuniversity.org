<p>Students welcome tertiary transport discounts</p>
<p>Auckland students are ecstatic at recently announced public transport discounts for tertiary students, which will collectively save students thousands of dollars annually.</p>
<p>The Auckland Regional Transport Authority has recently announced that full-time tertiary students will now get a 40% discount off the normal adult fare on ten-trip tickets, up from the current 20% discount.</p>
<p>While the exact fares are not finalised yet, a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the new discount suggests that for a student living in the suburbs, who lives 2 stages from the University, and travels twice a day to and from University every weekday using a ten-trip pass, will save $11 a week off the current adult fare(or $8 off the current tertiary fare). Over the academic year of 25 weeks of classes, this amounts to savings of up to $285 a year(or $197.50 off the current tertiary fare).</p>
<p>“Many of our students struggle to get by on a limited income through the student allowance or borrowing off their student loans for living costs. Transport is one of the major costs our students face, so this is most welcome news,” says David Do, AUSA Education Vice President.</p>
<p>“Any cost-benefit analysis shows it is much cheaper to use public transport than to drive, maintain, and park a private car. These discounts cement this cost saving further.”</p>
<p>Cheaper public transport has many benefits apart from economic. Increased use of public transport has environmental benefits, reduces traffic congestion, and reduces the need to use expensive inner-city carparking.</p>
<p>“Students applaud these moves to encourage sustainable public transport.”</p>
