<p><strong>Meanings make stolen medals irreplaceable</strong></p>
<p>Reaction to the theft of medals from the Waiouru museum has been dramatic because of their power as symbols of sacrifice and service, says a cultural researcher.</p>
<p>Associate Professor at Massey’s School of Visual and Material Culture, Tony Whincup calls the medals “mnemonic objects”.</p>
<p>“The medals are valuable because of the special meanings we attach to them. They symbolise outstanding military acts, but also our sense of who we are as New Zealanders.”</p>
<p>Professor Whincup says personal objects help define us, both as individuals and as a community.</p>
<p>“If my stereo gets stolen, I can easily replace it. But if I lost my wedding ring I would be devastated because of the memories I attach to it.”</p>
<p>“In the same way the loss of these medals diminishes us as a nation because we are defined by our heritage, which includes notions of bravery, sacrifice and service.”</p>
<p>“It’s a reciprocal arrangement, because we choose which parts of our heritage are most important to us.”</p>
<p>War memorial specialist and senior lecturer at the School, Kingsley Baird, asks why we are so devastated over what could be seen as objects made of cheap metal and ribbons?</p>
<p>“It’s because these medals are about the maintenance of memories. If we value them as objects, let’s look after them,” he says.</p>
<p>The School of Visual and Material Culture, part of the College of Creative Arts, is a centre of teaching and research excellence that seeks to develop new perspectives between people and things in the images and objects that shape everyday life.</p>
