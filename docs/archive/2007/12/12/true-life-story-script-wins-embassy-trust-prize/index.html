<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>11 December 2007<br>_________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>True-life story script picks up Embassy Trust Prize</p>
<p>A film-script that tells the story of a young Samoan chief who overcomes a fear of public speaking to make a speech that changes everything is the winner of the annual Embassy Trust Prize.</p>
<p>The drama is the work of Tusi Tamasese, a Scriptwriting Master&#39;s student in the University&#39;s International Institute of Modern Letters. Mr Tamasese received the $1000 prize at a function at the Embassy Theatre this week for Orator, a story that is based partly on his own reservations about public speaking, and also on his experience of growing up as a young chief on Upolu Island in Samoa.</p>
<p>Scriptwriter of acclaimed New Zealand films Vigil and Out of the Blue, Graeme Tetley, says Mr Tamasese&#39;s script, Orator, is an assured telling of a fine story.</p>
<p>&quot;This humane script is beautifully and powerfully imagined, executed and achieved,&quot; Mr Tetley says.</p>
<p>Victoria Scriptwriting Programme director Ken Duncum says the Embassy Trust prize recognises the best script for a feature film written for the major component of the Master&#39;s class. He says that while Mr Tusi Tamasese&#39;s script was a clear winner, the calibre of writing from the ten Master&#39;s students this year was consistently high.</p>
<p>&quot;The overall quality of writing increases year by year, as does the calibre of the students that apply each year for this very competitive course,&quot; Mr Duncum says.</p>
<p>&quot;This is indicative of how healthy the scriptwriting industry is becoming here and of how much more strength there now is in this art-form.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Duncum says that students who complete the postgraduate programme leave the International Institute of Modern Letters with a high quality full-length script that they can then offer to producers.</p>
