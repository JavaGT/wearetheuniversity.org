<p><strong>Monday, 3 December 2007, 9:04 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Tony Ryall MP<br>National Party Health Spokesman</p>

<p>Hospital bureaucracy out of control</p>
<p>The number of hospital managers will top 10,000 in the next year, showing that the health bureaucracy is out of control under Labour, says National&#39;s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>&quot;And this army of bureaucrats does not include the 1,250 Ministry of Health staff. Nor does it include managers in the 81 PHOs or endless consultants.&quot;</p>
<p>National is releasing information today which shows the number of health managers and administrators have grown by a quarter - or almost 2000 staff - since Labour came to office.</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time, the number of vitally needed hospital doctors increased by only 1,200.</p>
<p>&quot;The health bureaucracy is growing out of control, while far too many patients are forced to wait and wait for operations and specialist&#39;s appointments.</p>
<p>&quot;When thousands and thousands of patients have been culled from hospital waiting lists, this massive bureaucracy is an appalling indictment on Labour&#39;s policies.</p>
<p>&quot;This past financial year alone has seen a massive $544 million spent on hospital managers and administrators.</p>
<p>&quot;Last month, National revealed over the past six years, the payroll at the Ministry of Health rocketed by 55% and staff numbers increased by 24%.*</p>
<p>&quot;Fewer Kiwis are getting elective surgery on a population basis since Labour came to office. Labour has bought bureaucrats instead of operations.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark promised to cut a swathe through the health bureaucracy. But typical Labour, the health bureaucracy has become fatter and fatter&quot;.</p>
