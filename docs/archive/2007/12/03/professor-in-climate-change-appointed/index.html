<p><strong>Professor in Climate Change appointed</strong></p>
<p>Climate change research at Victoria University has been strengthened significantly with the appointment of New Zealand climate scientist Martin Manning as Professor and Research Fellow in Climate Change.</p>
<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) Professor Neil Quigley says the inaugural appointment is major step forward for the University&#39;s multi-disciplinary research platforms in climate change scientific research and policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Professor Manning has had a long and distinguished career in physics, atmospheric chemistry and policy of climate change both here and in the United States, and the University is delighted to see him join our research programmes in these areas,&quot; Professor Quigley says.</p>
<p>To take up the role in January, Professor Manning will play a key role among researchers contributing to the National Climate Change Centre – a collaborative initiative between Victoria and Canterbury universities and all nine Crown Research Institutes announced by the Government in October.</p>
<p>He will also assist the University in establishing the New Zealand Climate Change Institute, a research centre to be based at Victoria that will facilitate the collaboration of researchers and teachers nationwide in order to seek the best ways of adapting to and helping to mitigate the rapidly growing challenge of climate change.</p>
<p>Professor Quigley says the Chair in Climate Change supports the University&#39;s decision to invest an additional $300,000 per annum to supplement existing climate change research. The position will be located in the School of Government.</p>

He is a graduate of Victoria University.</p>
