<p><strong>Monday, 3 December 2007, 10:10 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_Students_Association">Auckland University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Shutting The University Doors – Students Say NO</strong></p>
<p>Auckland students are extremely concerned by, and will oppose, moves to eliminate open entry into the University of Auckland from 2009.</p>
<p>The University has proposed that entry to the degrees of Arts, Education, Law Part 1 and Theology be limited from 2009 onwards, effectively removing open entry into the University of Auckland. The exact details of these limitations would be worked out later. The University’s Senate(or Academic Board) will be debating the proposal this Monday afternoon from 4pm.</p>
<p>“We oppose removing open entry to these degrees because we believe universities should be open to all who are able and willing to study,” says David Do, AUSA Education Vice President.</p>
<p>“We are shutting the door on the potential students and achievers of the future. We are denying them the chance to make their mark on the world. Total limited entry means many students will not get the chance to get a higher education and succeed at a university of their choice,” says AUSA President Lesieli Oliver.</p>
<p>“Any limitations exercise would inevitably concentrate on a student’s grades from high school. But high school performance doesn’t guarantee a similar performance at University. For example, high-achieving ‘quality’ students can find the University environment difficult, and may drop out.”</p>
<p>AUSA is appalled at the absence of consultation with students. The proposal is going through University committees at the end of the year, after students have finished their study and exams. Students would be most directly affected by any changes, but have no way of effectively having their say on this important issue.</p>
<p>“The University has failed to meaningfully consult with key stakeholders such as students. The only student to have seen this proposal in detail is the student representative who sits on these committees – me!” says David Do.</p>
