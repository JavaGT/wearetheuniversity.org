<p>Simon Power MP<br>National Party Justice &amp; Corrections Spokesman</p>
<p>19 December 2007</p>
<p>Labour slack on court no-shows</p>
<p>Reporters note: attached is court-by-court breakdown of cases on hold</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s justice system failed to convict anyone last year for failing to appear in court even though thousands of court cases are on hold because defendants fail to appear, says National&#39;s Justice &amp; Corrections spokesman, Simon Power.</p>
<p>He is releasing figures showing that in 2006, the latest year for which figures are available, there were no convictions for failure to appear - the worst of any year since at least 1980.</p>
<p>Yet Courts Department figures show that at September this year there were 18,682 cases on hold because defendants had absconded while on bail or simply failed to turn up.</p>
<p>&quot;These figures are astounding.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#39;s the point of the law if it&#39;s not being enforced?</p>
<p>&quot;What sort of message are they sending to these people? That they can just decide to not appear and they get away with it?</p>
<p>&quot;And what sort of pressure is that going to put on the courts system?</p>
<p>&quot;At last count, there were 241 criminal jury trials outstanding in the High Court and 1,437 in district courts, with a median trial waiting time in the High Court of 290 days, and in district courts of 256 days.</p>
<p>&quot;And there have been 20 stays of prosecution in the past three years because of delays, 10 of them in just the past year.</p>
<p>&quot;All of this wastes the time of the courts and the police, and leaves victims of crime up in the air as they wait for justice.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s a shambles and it&#39;s all a result of Minister Rick Barker&#39;s failure to admit there is a problem.&quot;</p>
