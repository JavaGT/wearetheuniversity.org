<p>Wellington&#39;s Eco-City just hot-air?</p>
<p>Green Party MP Sue Kedgley says Wellington will have to give up any pretence at being an eco-city if it supports Wellington Mayor Kerry Prendergast&#39;s call for drilling another tunnel through Mt Victoria and extending State Highway One to Wellington Airport.</p>
<p>&quot;Ms Prendergast is rapidly reducing her vision of Wellington becoming the world&#39;s first eco-city to just public relations spin. If she is serious about Wellington being the world&#39;s first eco-city she will have to abandon her carbon-inducing plans for two new tunnels and a new state highway to the airport.</p>
<p>&quot;Extending a state highway to the airport will clog Wellington&#39;s streets even further, produce more carbon emissions and further marginalise those who, for whatever reason, prefer to cycle, walk or bus&quot;.</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley said she strongly supports Green Councillor Wade-Brown&#39;s position on Wellington Regional Council&#39;s Ngauranga to Airport study, which was released today for public submission.</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley said if Wellington City Council is serious about becoming an eco-city, it should embrace the proposal for a City-to Airport light-rail connection.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the opportunity for a light-rail network, and if we don&#39;t take the opportunity now, I fear it will be lost forever.</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley said she was alarmed at Mayor Prendergast comment this morning that a new Mt Victoria tunnel should be a high priority, regardless of what submitters to the study say.</p>
<p>&quot;Over a thousand people submitted on stage one of the draft regional council plan in favour of increased public transport funding rather than still more roading for Wellington.</p>

<p>&quot;Yet Ms Prendergast persists in her preference for private vehicles. This is despite a vast majority of previous submitters saying that they prefer other options for Wellington, such as a City to Airport light-rail connection.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes no sense in this instance - economically or sustainably - to build more roads and tunnels, which according to the study will cost $250 million, over light rail which will cost $140 million.&quot;</p>
