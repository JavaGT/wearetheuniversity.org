<h3>Spare a thought today for those at work</h3>
<p>The Council of Trade Unions is asking New Zealanders to spare a thought for those working on Christmas day and other public holidays this summer break.</p>
<p>&quot;While most of us are enjoying time with friends and families today, many thousands of workers like those in emergency services, health and transport are at work over the summer break, providing essential services for the rest of the country,&quot; CTU president Helen Kelly said.</p>
<p>Stronger work rights through a more modern holidays framework was benefiting workers, Ms Kelly said.</p>
<p>&quot;Four weeks annual leave came into effect this year, and this was great news for New Zealanders whose working hours are long compared to the rest of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The union movement was proud to have led the campaign for four weeks leave on behalf of all working people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And in the past, many people worked on public holidays for little or no extra pay and often against their will. Now, these days are recognised by requiring time and a half pay plus a day in lieu,&quot; Helen Kelly said.</p>
