<p>Hodgson confused over open entrance to unis</p>
<p>Tertiary Minister Pete Hodgson appears confused over Labour’s policy on the capped funding regime and how it impacts on open access to universities, says National’s Tertiary Education spokesman, Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>“At the Association of University Staff conference last week, Pete Hodgson had the gall to say: ‘the Government does not intend to end the New Zealand tradition of open entry to universities’.</p>
<p>“This flies in the face of Labour’s tertiary reforms, which introduce a capped model. It is also in direct contradiction to what most universities are likely to do – as already indicated by Auckland University.</p>
<p>“Mr Hodgson is either totally confused over the issue or he and his Government are being duplicitous.</p>
<p>“He also told the conference: ‘We are not looking to cap the participation rate of New Zealanders in tertiary education as a whole, or indeed to cap the participation rate of New Zealanders in Bachelor degrees.’</p>
<p>“The tertiary sector should have no confidence in a Minister who does not know the reality of his party’s own policies and can’t even make up his mind what his polices are.</p>
<p>“Labour’s tertiary reforms have come about after eight years of almost constant change and at a waste of over one billion education dollars.</p>
<p>“Pete Hodgson needs to come clean over Labour’s university entrance policy. His confusion in such a critical area should be of great concern.”</p>
