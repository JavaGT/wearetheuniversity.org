<p>PRESS RELEASE - FOR IMMEDIATE USE</p>
<p>Sutton wins Labour nomination for Epsom</p>
<p>Kate Sutton is excited to have been confirmed as Labour&#39;s candidate for<br>Epsom at next year&#39;s general election.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a great honour and privilege to have been selected to represent<br>Labour in Epsom. At the last election almost ten thousand people from this electorate voted to ensure Labour was returned to Government for an historic third term. I committed to working hard for the Labour vote in<br>Epsom, to return Helen Clark and the Labour led government for a fourth term in 2008&quot; Ms Sutton said.</p>
<p>Epsom LEC Chairman Grahame Lee observed that &quot;Epsom voters now had the choice of a refreshing young candidate over the too-familiar faces of the past.&quot;<br>Ms Sutton, who is 26, was brought up in Auckland and attended Glendowie College. She obtained a Master of Arts degree with honours majoring in Political Science at the University of Auckland, where she also served a term as the President of the Auckland University Students&#39; Association.</p>
<p>Ms Sutton works as Public affairs and Corporate Responsibly Manager for Landco Land Developments, is Chair of the Tamaki Community Board and an Alumni Representative on the University of Auckland Council</p>
