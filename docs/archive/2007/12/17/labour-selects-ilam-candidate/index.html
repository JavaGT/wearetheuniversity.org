<p><strong>Monday, 17 December 2007, 9:21 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>December 16 2007 Media Release</p>
<p>Labour Selects Ilam Candidate</p>
<p>The New Zealand Labour Party has chosen its first Chinese electorate candidate under MMP, with the selection on Saturday of Sam Yau for the Ilam seat.</p>
<p>Malaysian-born Mr Yau came to Christchurch as a student in 1985 and has been living here ever since. He is a businessman, a resident of Riccarton and active in his community.</p>
<p>Labour Party president Mike Williams said while Sam Yau was standing in a general electorate, his confirmation as Ilam’s Labour candidate also reflected the increasing role and importance of the Asian vote.</p>
<p>“The Asian community in New Zealand, including Christchurch, is growing. Many of these new New Zealanders are flocking to the Labour Party because they recognise Labour as the party which offers tolerance and opportunity for migrants.”</p>
<p>There were numerous Asian and migrant branches in the Labour Party, including an active ethnic branch in Christchurch.</p>
<p>Mr Yau said he was delighted to be confirmed as Labour candidate for Ilam.</p>
<p>“There is a major Asian presence in the electorate but I will also be promoting the Labour government’s achievements and some of the issues I would seek to represent as an MP.”</p>
<p>These include working to achieve a safer living environment; encouraging the City Council and Housing Corporation New Zealand to build more affordable houses in Ilam electorate and promoting awareness and tolerance between all cultures and religions to allow people to live in harmony.</p>
<p>“I am a good listener,” said Mr Yau. “I would like to communicate more with the residents in my electorate, so they can tell me the issues that are important to them and what our Labour-led Government can do to assist them.”</p>
