<p><strong>Wednesday, 5 December 2007, 1:35 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Paula Bennett MP National Party Community Programmes Spokeswoman</p>
<p>5 December 2007</p>
<p>Volunteers&#39; contribution vital</p>
<p>National&#39;s Community Programmes spokeswoman Paula Bennett is congratulating the thousands of volunteers who make vital contributions to their communities.</p>
<p>&quot;Today is International Volunteer Day, and it is a perfect opportunity to pay tribute to the large number of people who give up their time voluntarily to work in a wide variety of sectors in New Zealand society.</p>
<p>&quot;The contribution these people make cannot be under-estimated. Without them, some aspects of community life would simply fail to exist.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Bennett says National has always recognised the value of volunteers and has already announced a range of measures which promote the growth, ingenuity, and vitality of community groups.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<p>* All payments that reimburse volunteers for actual and reasonable expenses will be tax-free, regardless of the amount of the payment. * Honoraria payments will be tax-free up to an amount of $500 per year, per person. * Reducing compliance costs for community groups. * Investigating a venture capital fund for community organisations. * Removing the cap on personal tax rebates for charitable donations.</p>
<p>&quot;National recognises that volunteer groups build a greater sense of belonging and a shared pride in our communities. We want to promote a culture of generosity and volunteering in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour sneeringly called National&#39;s policy &#39;Tory charity&#39;, but proceeded to quietly copy it.</p>

<p>&quot;Unlike the Government, we won&#39;t treat volunteers as cheap labour. National will also look at full-cost funding for non-profit organisations which provide certain services. Currently, these groups are often short-changed in Government funding and need to find the shortfall themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;Congratulations to all those groups that are already making an invaluable contribution to society.&quot;</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
