<p>Tony Ryall MP National Party Health Spokesman</p>

<p>Health system so bad - patients clean toilets</p>
<p>National Party Health spokesman Tony Ryall says the state of the public health system is so bad that patients in Rotorua are being forced to clean their own toilets.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the extra $5 billion that Labour is spending per year on public health, patients are now being forced to clean their own toilets. Despite the thousands of extra managers, hospitals are failing to even do the basics.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ryall is referring to reports in Rotorua&#39;s Daily Post today, where a frustrated patient recovering from surgery felt compelled to pick up a scrubbing brush and don rubber gloves and clean the loo herself.</p>
<p>One witness is quoted as saying &#39;rubbish bins in the ladies&#39; toilets and showers were so full they had piled up used sanitary pads around them&#39;... &#39;where is all the money going that Prime Minister Helen Clark says they are putting into hospitals?&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;What&#39;s clear from these reports is that the problems aren&#39;t confined to Wellington. What&#39;s David Cunliffe going to do about this? More sabre rattling on sacking the board?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ryall says hospital officials are understating the problem when they say the situation in Rotorua is &#39;unacceptable&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;When the spread of disease and viruses through our hospitals is such a large risk, patients and their supporters can&#39;t be expected to clean their own toilets.</p>
<p>&quot;Like the $100 voucher for new mums to leave hospital early, I&#39;m confident David Cunliffe will say this is not Government policy.</p>
<p>&quot;It might not be Government policy, but it&#39;s the result of this Government&#39;s policy,&quot; says Mr Ryall.</p>
