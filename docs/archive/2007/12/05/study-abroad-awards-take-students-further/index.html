<p><strong>Study abroad awards take postgraduate students further</strong></p>
<p>Victoria postgraduate students have been awarded the greatest number of scholarships of all universities in the latest round of New Zealand Postgraduate Study Abroad Awards.</p>
<p>Funded by Education New Zealand, the awards help top postgraduate students gain short-term access to some of the best educational institutions and opportunities overseas. They also aim to<br>raise the international profile and reputation of New Zealand’s universities and increase international education linkages and partnerships.</p>
<p>Victoria Scholarships Manager, Philippa Hay says 22 Masters and Doctoral students received awards up to $10,000 each for projects spanning the sciences, humanities, architecture and commerce. 72 awards were granted in total.</p>
<p>&quot;Victoria students traditionally do quite well in these awards, but this round has been the most successful” .</p>
<p>Ms Hay says this type of funding for postgraduate study is often difficult to obtain and that international travel – to present at conferences, conduct fieldwork, or carry out co-operative research at another institution – is a very important part of postgraduate studies.</p>
<p>Of the 22 students, 14 are from the Faculty of Science, 4 from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, 3 from the Faculty of Commerce and Administration and 1 from the Faculty of Architecture and Design.</p>
<p>Students projects include a critical study of radical Islam in Malaysia, a history of marriage, citizenship and divorce in two British settler societies, seismic anisotrophy as a stress indicator on volcanoes, modelling land-use dynamics and change, urban growth assessment and prediction , and the ecology of coral reef fish in French Polynesia.</p>
