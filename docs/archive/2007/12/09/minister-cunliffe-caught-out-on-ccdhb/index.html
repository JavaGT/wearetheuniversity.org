<p>Minister Cunliffe Caught Out On CCDHB</p>
<p>The article in the latest edition of the &#39;Hawkes Bay Today&#39; newspaper<br>flies in the face of Health Minister David Cunliffe&#39;s claim that I was<br>effectively lying when I stated in the House that people from other<br>hospitals were dying as a result of Capital &amp; Coast DHB&#39;s failures, ACT<br>New Zealand Health Spokesman and Wellington-based MP Heather Roy said<br>today.</p>
<p>&quot;This article - titled &#39;HB Heart Patients Dying For Surgery&#39; - has<br>confirmed my statement while, at the same time, disproved the Minister&#39;s<br>claim that I am a liar,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Cunliffe should be embarrassed that he has been caught and - out of<br>shame, if nothing else - now come clean on how other DHBs are affected<br>when they too rely on CCDHB for tertiary healthcare services for their<br>patients.</p>
<p>&quot;Further, the Minister continues to refuse to answer the question I<br>originally asked of him in Parliament last week: has he personally been<br>advised of any of the deaths of patients on waiting lists for tertiary<br>surgery at Wellington Hospital in the past year?</p>
<p>&quot;This is a simple question that requires an equally simple &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no&#39;<br>answer. Instead of wasting his time making personal attacks on me, Mr<br>Cunliffe should be trying to improve the serious situation at CCDHB by<br>appointing an independent Commissioner - someone free of the political<br>interference that he and his Ministry are notorious for,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
