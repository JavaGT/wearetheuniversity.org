<p>Benchmark survey on Kiwi use of internet</p>
<p>AUT University has released the findings of a benchmark survey looking at how New Zealanders use the internet.</p>
<p>The survey, led by AUT University&#39;s Professor Allan Bell, is part of the World Internet Project (WIP) - an international collaborative project looking at the social, political and economic impact of the internet and other new technologies.</p>
<p>Some of the key findings include:</p>
<p>- New Zealanders&#39; use the internet heavily to conduct their everyday business, 83% of users access information about products online, and 60% buy things online. 51% pay bills, and 62% make travel reservations or bookings. 68% use their bank&#39;s online services.</p>
<p>- 29% of the users access the internet through wireless or mobile phone. 68% have broadband at home, while 31% have dialup. Those without broadband at home are more likely to be older, live in rural areas and have lower household incomes than broadband users.</p>
<p>- An important proportion of New Zealanders generate their own content on the web, especially those under 30 years. 13% of all users have their own website.</p>
<p>- 27% have posted messages on discussion/message boards, and 33% have posted pictures, photos or videos on the web. 10% have their own blog, with 21% of bloggers being under 20 years of age.</p>
<p>- Respondents rate the internet above all other sources as an important or very important source of information (62%), compared to newspapers and television (both 54%) and radio (46%). The internet even rates above interpersonal sources such as family and friends (58%), despite non-users being included in these responses.</p>

<p>- Socialising is a major use of the internet, and 77% of users check their email every day. 10% participate in multi-player online games at least daily, and 16% participate in social networking sites like MySpace or Facebook at least daily.</p>
<p>- 81% of the sample of New Zealanders use the internet</p>
<p>- Internet access, usage, capability and attitudes are all strongly graded by New Zealanders&#39; age, income and area of residence. The younger, wealthier and more urban people are, the more connected and confident they are online.</p>
<p>- Most people believe the internet is considerably enhancing their social contacts rather than diminishing them.</p>
