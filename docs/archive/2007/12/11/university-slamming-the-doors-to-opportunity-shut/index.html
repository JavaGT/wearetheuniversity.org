<p>Media Release - 11 December 2007 - For Immediate Use</p>
<p><strong>Students Slam University For Slamming The Doors To Opportunity Shut</strong></p>
<p>Auckland students are upset and disappointed that the University of Auckland Council has voted to eliminate open entry into the University from 2009.</p>
<p>Council voted overwhelmingly for the proposal despite strong representations by the two student representatives, David Do and Anna Crowe, who were also the only ones to vote against the proposal.</p>
<p>“We’re saddened by this result because this shows that the University has failed to acknowledge the legitimate concerns of students and the community,” says David Do, AUSA Education Vice President.</p>
<p>“This three-page proposal was rammed through in just over three weeks without proper consultation or consideration of the impact this decision would have. Students are angry they never got a real say in this important issue.”</p>
<p>Concerned students and members of the public packed out the Council chamber today to listen to the debate on the proposal, after staging a creative protest inside the Clocktower building. There was also significant media interest in the Council meeting.</p>
<p>“The fact that this proposal has generated so much interest in the community demonstrates that there are very significant issues at stake and we don’t feel that those issues have been resolved”, says Anna Crowe, the other student representative on Council.</p>
