<p>Labour loses more than 6,000 children from school</p>
<p>An admission by the Education Ministry that it has ‘lost’ 6,334 school-aged children by their parents’ failure to enrol them is staggering, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>“And this is just the tip of the iceberg – the numbers are expected to increase substantially when primary school data is added in.</p>
<p>“The reality of these cold, hard figures is that there are thousands of children who have lost learning opportunities that cannot be recovered.</p>
<p>“Many of them are exactly the same ones who turn up in the Youth Court.</p>
<p>“Judge Andrew Beecroft told the Education and Science Select Committee that when it came to youth crime, non-enrolment was by far a bigger issue than truancy. He estimated that the ‘lost’ children could number 1,000 or 2,000 - no one imagined a figure of 6,334.</p>
<p>“The Minister will no doubt say this figure is solely as a result of the implementation of the software programme ENROL. The computer system does not explain the total growth in non-enrolments which, according to official documents, has seen ‘an 8% annual increase in non- enrolments’ since 2000.</p>
<p>“Having overseen a dramatic 41% rise in the truancy rate between 2002 and 2006, Labour should be ashamed to preside over this equally disturbing trend in non-enrolments.</p>
<p>“Students can’t get the education they deserve if they are not enrolled and not in front of a teacher. It’s that simple.&quot;</p>
