<p>Maori Scholarship Winner A Success Story For Others To Follow</p>
<p>New Zealand First Maori Affairs spokesperson Pita Paraone says Pegasus Health Maori and Pacific Scholarship winner Eli Leckey is a perfect example of a success story that highlights the importance of education as a key to upward mobility, regardless of race or background.</p>
<p>“Mr Leckey has proved that despite odds being stacked against him: a former truck driver with no formal qualifications, and a family and social background that does not expect or encourage their kids to go to university, he is well on his way of one day becoming a doctor,” said Mr Paraone.</p>
<p>“We need to promote and highlight success stories like Mr Leckey’s as they would not be possible if recent moves by some universities to restrict course entry numbers becomes common practice. If anything, they would only serve to hinder Maori development.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First believes that education is a critical social and economic investment. We will continue to deliver an education policy that enables each and every New Zealander to achieve his or her greatest potential,” said Mr Paraone.</p>
<p>“Let’s applaud Mr Leckey and the other scholarship recipients and hope others are encouraged to follow in his footsteps.”</p>
