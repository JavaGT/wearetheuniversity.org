<p>NCEA botch-up needs explanation</p>
<p>National Party Education spokeswoman Katherine Rich says the Education Minister must front up and explain the latest NCEA botch-up, after nine Avondale College history students had their Level 3 NCEA papers returned unmarked.</p>
<p>“Days after the release of the 2006 NCEA results, NZQA went public claiming the 2006 exam results had been a success.</p>
<p>“NZQA said students could expect ‘robust and reliable’ results.</p>
<p>“Weeks later, we find that nine Avondale College students have had their exam papers returned unmarked and totally unblemished.</p>
<p>“The students have recorded ‘result not available’ on their exam scorecard.</p>
<p>“This means they had their exam papers collected, sent to the dispatch centre to have a holiday, but returned unmarked and unblemished.</p>
<p>“Internal systems have failed and now NZQA is scrambling to explain and fix the problem.</p>
<p>“Quite rightly, teachers, students and parents are livid.</p>
<p>“NZQA has not delivered on its promise and, typically, the Minister remains silent on NCEA glitches.</p>
<p>“The Avondale problems follow a similar botch-up at Dunedin’s Logan Park High School where one third of students were unable to access their NCEA results after they were released.</p>
<p>“It’s time Steve Maharey came out of his hole and explained to these students why their papers are blank and what he intends to do about NZQA’s patchy record on NCEA.”</p>
