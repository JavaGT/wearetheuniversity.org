<p><strong>Wednesday, 14 February 2007, 11:29 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Tau Henare MP<br>National Party Maori Affairs Spokesman(Education)<br>14 February 2007</p>
<p>More Maori wagging school</p>
<p>National Party Maori Affairs spokesman Tau Henare says figures showing a jump in the number of Maori students wagging school are unacceptable and must be addressed by the Labour-led Government.</p>
<p>Figures from the New Zealand Schools Attendance, Absence and Truancy report for 2006 show 7.1% of Maori females and 6.6% of Maori males are playing truant.</p>
<p>The figures have climbed since 2004 and now Maori have a truancy rate more than 4% higher than New Zealand European students.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister promised in her speech to address truancy with new initiatives and resources, but for some Maori children it is too late,” Mr Henare says.</p>
<p>“Already this week we have heard that 53% of Maori boys and 45% of Maori girls are leaving school without Level 1 NCEA.</p>
<p>“The Labour Government is clearly failing Maori children and it is time Maori got more than lip-service from Ms Clark – they need action to ensure they get the best possible education.</p>
<p>“In the entire 35 minute speech from the Prime Minister yesterday the only specific mention of Maori was around the forestry industry - not addressing our appalling education statistics.</p>
<p>“Is it a plan of the Labour Government to have unqualified Maori drop-outs staffing the forestry industry?”</p>
