<p>Judith Collins MP<br>National Party Welfare Spokeswoman</p>
<p>14 February 2007</p>
<p>Don&#39;t leave town &#39;til you&#39;ve seen the country</p>
<p>&quot;Families Commissioner Rajen Prasad needs to get off his business class seat and come down to the coalface with me,&quot; says National Party Welfare spokeswoman Judith Collins.</p>
<p>She is responding to a startling admission by Dr Prasad at a select committee this morning that he has never visited the HIPPY programmes running in Auckland.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet, he has spent three weeks and nearly $11,000 of taxpayer money on a visit to New York where he attended a HIPPY conference, and met with academics working in the same field.</p>
<p>&quot;Any reasonable taxpayer would expect that Mr Prasad might have looked at what&#39;s going on in his own backyard before heading overseas.&quot;</p>
<p>The Home Interaction Programme for Parents and Youngsters (HIPPY) is a home-based programme that supports parents in becoming actively involved in their four and five year old children&#39;s learning.</p>
<p>&quot;Surely, in order to improve a system or a programme, commonsense suggests you first become acquainted with what&#39;s happening on the frontline here at home. I am happy to provide Dr Prasad with that opportunity - and it won&#39;t cost the taxpayer $11,000.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m not saying we shouldn&#39;t learn from overseas experience, but Dr Prasad should have visited these programmes - he is the Chief Families Commissioner after all, and HIPPY has been running here for 16 years.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Collins says she plans to invite Dr Prasad to join her on a visit to a HIPPY programme running in South Auckland.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;d be impressed with what they&#39;re trying to achieve. He may even learn some things about the unique New Zealand setting which the academics in New York wouldn&#39;t know about.&quot;</p>
