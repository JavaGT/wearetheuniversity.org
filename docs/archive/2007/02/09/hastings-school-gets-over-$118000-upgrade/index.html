<p>Hastings school gets over $118,000 upgrade</p>
<p>9 February 2007</p>
<p>Students at a Hastings school will return to their classes this week to hear good news about new school facilities.</p>
<p>Bridge Pa School is getting $118,019 for capital works above and beyond what they would normally get for classrooms to cope with roll growth.</p>
<p>Labour MP Rick Barker says the funding is part of the Labour-led government&#39;s Schools Property Guide Programme, which this year provides $30 million for schools around the country to improve learning environments and make room for more students.</p>
<p>&quot;The funding announced today means Bridge Pa School can build new facilities or upgrade what they already have. They can decide for themselves what facilities they&#39;ll build to satisfy the learning needs of their growing numbers of students.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past, schools have used funding from this programme for extensions to buildings or new administration blocks, halls and gyms.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve spoken to a lot of parents in this area, and they generally want their children to enjoy safe, modern learning environments; the kids love it, they learn better, acquire more knowledge and skills and it sets them up for a better start to their working lives.</p>
<p>The Labour-led government introduced the Schools Property Guide Programme in 1999 so that schools could build new facilities as they needed them, and has provided funding to over four hundred schools.</p>
<p>&quot;The big investment we&#39;ve made in school property since 1999 means that instead of putting up with patched-up old buildings, schools are now using funding to continue modernising and improving their buildings,&quot; said Rick Barker.</p>
