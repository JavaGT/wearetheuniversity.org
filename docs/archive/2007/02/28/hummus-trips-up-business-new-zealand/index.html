<p>Hummus trips up Business New Zealand</p>
<p>Business New Zealand Chief Executive Phil O&#39;Reilly has been undermined by a humble tub of hummus, the Green Party says.</p>
<p>&quot;This Kiwi-produced container of hummus shows exactly why Mr O&#39;Reilly&#39;s &#39;she&#39;ll be right attitude&#39; won&#39;t work,&quot; Greens Spokesperson on Waste Nandor Tanczos says.</p>
<p>Business New Zealand has today released a report, which Mr O&#39;Reilly says shows visions for a waste free New Zealand are severely disconnected from economic reality and advocates leaving it up to producers to do their bit to reduce waste.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the situation at present and it is not working - and this tub of hummus proves it,&quot; Nandor says.</p>
<p>&quot;While the product inside the container was delicious, the packaging will still be floating around in a landfill long after Mr O&#39;Reilly and I both have shuffled off the planet.</p>
<p>&quot;Like many others, this dip came in a type 5 plastic container - which is not generally taken for recycling and inevitably ends up in the dump.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The manufacturers of this product had the choice to use a recyclable container, but no incentive to do so because it&#39;s the ratepayer who picks up the tab for disposal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr O&#39;Reilly says his organization supports efforts to reduce waste, to the extent they are practical and cost effective, but his real concern seems to be helping business avoid paying for their pollution.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing cost-effective for the community about having to dump in a landfill something that could otherwise be easily recycled. In fact, it will cost ratepayers money to have it transported to the dump and will reduce the lifespan of the tip meaning the community will have to spend more money building a new one even sooner.</p>

<p>&quot;This tub of hummus is not the only example. There are thousands more products in containers just like it ending up in landfills all over the country every day. That is why Extended Producer Responsibility, as outlined in my bill, is so essential.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Business New Zealand can commission report after report, slanted to support its case, but this tub of hummus speaks volumes about the need to take some positive steps to reduce waste,&quot; Nandor says.</p>
