<p>Pests to take million dollar hit!</p>
<p>Million dollar funding announced for Lincoln University for pest control `smart baits´ research</p>
<p>Research at Lincoln University aimed at developing Smart Pest Control technologies for environmentally injurious animal species such as rodents, weasels, feral cats and possums received a funding injection of over $1 million today (28.2.07) from the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology.</p>
<p>It´s part of a package of over $10 million announced by the Foundation for research projects targeted at two areas - new sustainable energy resources, and the restoration, preservation and improvement of New Zealand´s ecosystems.</p>
<p>$1.159 million of that money is going to Lincoln University, one of only two universities funded in this new allocation.</p>
<p>The Lincoln project is being led by ecologist Dr Shaun Ogilvie of Lincoln University´s Bio-Protection and Ecology Division and it is a collaboration with Auckland-based Connovation Ltd, a commercial company involved with pest control, repellents and animal monitoring. Others will be involved too.</p>
<p>The research is aimed at producing Smart Pest Control technologies for animal species such as rodents, weasels, feral cats and possums which prey on threatened native species and transmit diseases (such as TB) that can jeopardise export earnings. The aim is to transform existing pest control measures and produce new &quot;smart&quot; technologies and techniques that are humane, cost-effective, target multiple pest species and have minimal non- target side effects.</p>
