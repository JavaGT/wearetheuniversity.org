<p>Seeing red – a new tomato product<br>By Janette Busch</p>
<p>Are you disappointed by the dark and unattractive colour of so many dried tomatoes sold in New Zealand?</p>
<p>Scientists from the food group at Lincoln University believe they have found a way to produce bright red semi-dried tomatoes that have an acceptable taste and keeping qualities.</p>
<p>Sébastien Viellet, a food engineering exchange student from France was given the task of producing a new tomato product that retained all the essential characteristics of fresh tomatoes, with a bright red colour similar to fresh tomatoes.</p>
<p>The high temperatures commonly used to produce dried tomatoes damage their cells, causing them to develop a dark colour that many people find unattractive while also lowering their nutritional content. Sébastien was successful in developing a new drying method that used lower temperatures than those used to produce commercially available dried tomatoes, and this did not affect their nutritional content or shelf life.</p>
<p>After devising a range of different treatments he carried out two sensory evaluation trials where people were able to eat two different semi-dried tomato cultivars prepared in different ways and give their preferences.</p>
<p>“I was quite surprised by the sensory evaluation results. What I found was that when the panellists were asked to choose between two different times of smoking of the semi-dried tomatoes it was very clear that older people liked the longer smoked tomatoes far more than the students did,” said Sébastien.</p>

<p>“In the second sensory evaluation I used tomatoes smoked for a longer time and compared my product (sprayed with either white or Balsamic vinegar) with two commercial products.</p>
<p>In this evaluation the panellists definitely preferred the plain semi-dried tomato and the one treated with white vinegar because they said they were a much brighter red than the commercially prepared products. In fact, the redder the tomato, the more it was liked.</p>
<p>As the shelf life of a product depends on its moisture content, Sébastien also prepared a selection of tomatoes with a range of different levels of moisture and recorded the colour, vitamin C and antioxidant levels of the fresh tomatoes and the final products in order to find the best combination that was liked by consumers and ensured a long shelf life.</p>
<p>“Many people will think that a functional food is a food that is altered in some way to make it more nutritious,” said Professor Geoffrey Savage who supervised Sébastien’s Lincoln project, “but that is not necessarily so.</p>
<p>“Many of our familiar foods already contain compounds that are of benefit to us, like tomatoes. In addition we found that the semi-dried product actually contained higher lycopene levels than the fresh tomatoes it was made from.”</p>
<p>“I was delighted that Sébastien was so successful in developing a new and exciting functional food product that has the potential to be developed commercially,” he said.</p>
<p>Dr Savage said that in France it is common for universities to require their Food Engineering students to complete a final year project in an English speaking country, and that’s what brought Sébastien to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Sébastien’s work followed on from previous research projects undertaken by other students in the Lincoln University food group.</p>
