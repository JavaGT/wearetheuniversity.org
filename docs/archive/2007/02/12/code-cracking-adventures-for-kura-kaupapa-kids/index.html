<p>Code-cracking adventures for kura kaupapa kids</p>
<p>Children returned to Kura Kaupapa Mäori schools last month to the final book in a trilogy of space-adventure, code-busting chapter-books written in Te Reo Mäori.</p>
<p>Darryn Joseph, a lecturer in Te Pütahi a Toi (School of Mäori Studies) at the University’s Palmerston North campus, says the third book in the RT3 series stands alone, but also builds on the stories and characters developed in the first two. In the third book, Ki Tua o Täwauwau, Mr Joseph (who writes under the pseudonym Täkuta Höhepa) includes a second point of view – that of Hinewai. He says Hinewai’s gutsy character, and the fact that she piloted a spaceship in the first two books, proved popular with young readers, girls particularly.</p>
<p>“A second point of view makes for a more challenging read, which is the intention of this series – to extend kids’ reading skills,” he says.</p>
<p>The books contain themes children can identify with. The little hero, Rangi Tautoru, is brought up by his eccentric grandfather and goes on a space adventure with Hinewai, his best friend.</p>
<p>All three books feature the illustrations of award-winning illustrator Ali Teo and a major theme in the series is code language. The first book featured rhyming riddles, the second used illustrated riddles and the third features a code-wheel designed by Mr Joseph using a combination of numerical code, alien code, morse code and code made from traditional Mäori motifs.</p>
<p>“The codes are like a secret language that readers can engage with and add a fun challenge to the stories.”</p>

<p>Mr Joeseph has also included kiwaha (idiomatic expressions) to engage readers, and he invented a new genre of numerical rhyming karakia (like a cross between a sports chant and a karakia). The books are written for 10-12 year olds, and kohanga reo teachers have been reading them aloud to their younger pupils.</p>
<p>The educational arm of Huia Publishing, Te Manu Tuku Korero, asked Mr Joseph to come up with a plot and characters for a chapter-book for children in December 2002.</p>
<p>The publishers knew he had the right blend of literary skill and imagination. Mr Joseph was a finalist in the 1999 and 2001 Huia short story competition and in 2003 won the 2003 Huia short story competition with Tama Tähae, Tama Ora.</p>
<p>He will finish his doctoral thesis on Mäori literature this year, under the supervision of Professor Tai Black. He learnt Te Reo Mäori as an undergraduate student and has fine-tuned his fluency through an honours year at Massey.</p>
