<p>Exits, lies and interviews - new research</p>
<p>Companies struggling with high staff turnover could get valuable insights by using exit interviews effectively, AUT research shows.</p>
<p>Analysis of staff turnover for international hotel chain Accor provided unexpected results. AUT hospitality management student John Parker found employees weren&#39;t being honest in exit interviews about their reasons for leaving the company. Redesigning the interviews, he says, could reveal useful clues.</p>
<p>The hotel&#39;s management were so impressed with his work that they have taken him on as a trainee manager.</p>
<p>John produced the research paper for Accor as a co-op student last year while completing his Bachelor of International Hospitality Management. He says the company&#39;s New Zealand managers were surprised by the results - but also pleased.</p>
<p>&quot;This information will be of interest to other multinational organisations like the Hilton hotel chain,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>John found the exit interviews produced little valuable information. Often employees did not give the real reasons for leaving, perhaps because they were interviewed by their own managers. &quot;Employees don&#39;t want to burn their bridges - the hospitality industry is a small world.&quot;</p>
<p>He suggested Accor redesign the exit interviews to extract meaningful information from employees. &quot;It&#39;s a matter of asking the right questions.&quot;</p>
<p>John&#39;s research won him the rare honour of being invited to present a paper at the Council for Australian University Tourism and Hospitality Education conference in Sydney last month.</p>
<p>Hospitality and tourism lecturer David Williamson says John&#39;s success is a testament to AUT&#39;s approach to co-operative education. &quot;He received great applied support from HR manager Graeme Ham and HR coordinator Victoria Nielsen at Accor Hotels, while AUT&#39;s academic team gave him the theoretical base to produce outstanding work.&quot;</p>
