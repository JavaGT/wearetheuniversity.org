<p>Media Release</p>
<p>26 February 2007</p>
<p>Shortlived Appointment Costly for DHB</p>
<p>The recruitment, appointment and subsequent resignation of Chief Executive Malcolm Stamp must have been an extremely costly exercise for the Waikato District Health Board, says New Zealand First’s health spokesperson, Barbara Stewart.</p>
<p>“Mr Stamp’s appointment followed what the Board described as “an extensive international search”, which would have been pricey as the services of recruitment agencies don’t come cheap.</p>
<p>“Relocation expenses would have been included in the recruitment package – travel from the other side of the world is expensive.</p>
<p>“Then there was the extensive introduction and familiarisation process required to bring Mr Stamp up to speed with the New Zealand way of doing things.</p>
<p>“After the outlay of all these taxpayer health dollars Mr Stamp stayed just eight months in the job before spying greener pastures in the United Kingdom and getting back there as fast as he could.</p>
<p>“The district health board has reportedly started the recruitment process again. Instead of conducting another extensive international search it is to be hoped they look nationally for someone who is likely to be here for the long haul, rather than another gold-plated executive likely to depart with alacrity at the first opportunity,” said Mrs Stewart.</p>
