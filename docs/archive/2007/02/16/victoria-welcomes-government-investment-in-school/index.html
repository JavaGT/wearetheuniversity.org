<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>16 February 2007</p>
<p>Victoria welcomes Government investment in School</p>
<p>The Government’s decision to invest $4 million in Victoria’s School of Government recognises the University’s long-standing strength in teaching and research in public management and administration, says Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh.</p>
<p>The announcement of a one-off $4 million grant to Victoria’s School of Government and a $6 million grant to the Australia &amp; New Zealand School of Government (ANZSOG) was made by New Zealand Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Helen Clark, at a joint press conference today (Friday 16 February) with Australian Prime Minister, the Hon John Howard.</p>
<p>ANZSOG was formed in 2002 and both Victoria University and the New Zealand Government were founding partners, along with the Australian Federal Government and several state governments and leading Australian universities. As well as research, the School, headed by eminent Australian academic Professor Allan Fels, offers a Master of Public Administration (Executive) degree. The Australian Government has also recently made a significant capital investment in ANZSOG.</p>
<p>The grant will be used to fund activities of Victoria’s School of Government that strengthen the practice-based teaching components of its programmes in public management and administration and the research interface between the School and the State sector. It will also further the School’s capability to deliver on these objectives and support New Zealand’s relationship with Australia through ANZSOG.</p>

<p>Professor Walsh thanked the Government for its investment, which he said was further recognition of Victoria’s long-standing reputation as a leading provider of education to the public sector.</p>
<p>“Our decision in 2002, to establish the School of Government as a centre of excellence in public policy and public management has been vindicated by today’s announcement and builds on the Memorandum of Understanding the University signed with the States Services Commissioner in 2003.</p>
<p>“Located on our Pipitea Campus in downtown Wellington, a short distance from the three branches of New Zealand’s democracy, the School has quickly established itself as the primary gateway not only for educating New Zealand’s public servants but also providing high quality advice and research into public policy issues.”</p>
<p>Professor Walsh said the Government’s development goals for state services fitted well with the School’s ethos.</p>
<p>“The Government believes excellent state servants should always be learning and this fits well with our School of Government’s goal of making academic skills and knowledge available to state servants when and where they are needed.”</p>
