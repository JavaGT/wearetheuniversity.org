<p>Design project boosts international competitiveness</p>
<p>A Massey University research project focusing on desirable design has been awarded a $1 million grant for a two-year project that will see the University collaborate with manufacturers such as Navman, Macpac, Gallagher Group and Tait Electronics.</p>
<p>Director of Affect, the Centre for Affective Design at the University’s Wellington campus, Dr Anders Warell says the grant will improve capability in research, teaching and consultancy to industry.</p>
<p>“It provides us with new options to engage with industry and make our industrial design programmes more relevant. We aim to integrate affective design concepts into industry’s mindset and processes.”</p>
<p>Affective design is about tailoring products that people bond with emotionally, such as the iPod or VW Beetle.</p>
<p>The project aims at boosting New Zealand manufacturers and designers international competitiveness through focusing on design for desirability. A team headed by Professor Bob Hodgson has been granted $164,132 to develop wellqualified ICT professionals.</p>
<p>This project will identify the knowledge and skills gaps of people who work in engineering and computer science-related roles, but lack formal graduate qualifications.</p>
<p>It aims to design a qualification that will bring their skills up to graduate level. The projects are funded through the Tertiary Education Commission’s Growth and Innovation Pilot Initiatives.</p>
