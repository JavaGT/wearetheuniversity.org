<p>The University of Waikato Council has elected the Right Hon. Jim Bolger, ONZ, as Chancellor.</p>
<p>Mr Bolger, who was Prime Minister of New Zealand from October 1990 to December 1997, has been appointed for an initial term of one year.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford said the appointment of Jim Bolger as Chancellor was a historic moment for the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>‘By taking up this role, Jim brings new national and international dimensions to the university at a time when universities must benchmark themselves against the best in the world so we can serve New Zealand effectively,’; Professor Crawford said.</p>
<p>‘His leadership qualities and international standing will make him an excellent ambassador for the university.’</p>
<p>Professor Crawford took the opportunity also to thank the outgoing Chancellor, Mr John Jackman, for his significant contribution to the University since his election in 2005.</p>
<p>‘Mr Jackman has been active in securing Mr Bolger as the new Chancellor. He has done an outstanding job for Waikato and on behalf of the University and Council members I would like to extend a warm vote of thanks,’ he said.</p>
<p>Mr Jackman who has served on the University Council for more than six years, as one of four Ministerial appointees, joined the Vice-Chancellor in welcoming Mr Bolger’s election.</p>
<p>‘We have been talking to Mr Bolger for some time about taking a leadership role at the University and I am delighted that he has accepted the Chancellorship. I am looking forward to working with him during the transition period.’</p>
