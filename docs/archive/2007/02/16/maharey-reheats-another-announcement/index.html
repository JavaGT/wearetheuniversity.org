<p>Maharey reheats another announcement</p>
<p>Education Minister Steve Maharey should stick to the facts and quit reheating old funding announcements in a vain attempt to get positive media coverage, says National Party Education spokeswoman Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>Labour today re-launched a $7.59 million careers education programme already announced in last year’s Budget.</p>
<p>“Steve Maharey has been caught red-handed rehashing an announcement and worse, changing the facts to suit.</p>
<p>“His photo opportunity today is about as honest as reheating last night’s dinner and calling it a banquet.</p>
<p>“This is the same initiative he announced in last year’s budget but this time around he has changed the name from &#39;Quality Careers Advice for Students&#39; to ‘CPaBL: Creating Pathways and Building Lives’.</p>
<p>“Steve Maharey tried the same reheat and rehash trick with a $32 million schools funding announcement on February 2.</p>
<p>“He is arrogant enough to think the education sector won’t notice his publicity stunts.</p>
<p>“What’s more, he has misled New Zealanders by saying today’s initiative is getting $7.59 million over two years - budget documents clearly say the money is over three years.</p>
<p>“As for CPaBL, who thinks of these bizarre names?</p>
<p>“The original name &#39;Quality Careers Advice for Students&#39; at least gave an indication of what the initiative tried to achieve.</p>
<p>“The name ‘CPaBL’ will make most educators sigh and roll their eyes. It is unintelligable, meaningless and just plain silly. “</p>
