<p>Slippery process surrounds problem gambling rort</p>
<p>National MP Sandra Goudie says Labour is frantically racing to cover up serious long-term issues within problem gambling providers.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars have been poured into services that haven’t been delivered. When I raised the alarm last year the Minister promised an urgent report. Five months later and we’re still waiting.</p>
<p>“But what’s now clear is that Damien O’Connor does indeed have the report and in the time that has passed since he broke his public promise, he has been desperately trying to neutralise the public fallout.”</p>
<p>Mr O’Connor confirmed today that three problem gambling provider contracts have been terminated, four have had their funding reduced and nine others are being monitored.</p>
<p>“First – I consider this a victory for the National Party. But I am appalled that Mr O’Connor is looking to cover up the mess before he finally releases the documents publicly.</p>
<p>“Given his bungling stewardship of the Corrections portfolio, I understand why he didn’t want another embarrassment on his hands.</p>
<p>“But it’s hard not to reach the conclusion that this Minister ordered a report solely to buy himself some time for belated damage control.</p>
<p>“How long have these providers been under-delivering Mr O’Connor? Precisely how much taxpayer money has been wasted on services that were never offered?</p>
<p>“Mr O’Connor may think he has cleverly got away with pulling the wool over the public’s eyes. I can assure him he hasn’t.”</p>
