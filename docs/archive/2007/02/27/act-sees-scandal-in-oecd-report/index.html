<p>ACT Sees Scandal In OECD Report</p>
<p>Heather Roy Tuesday, 27 February 2007 Press Releases - Economy</p>
<p>The key to turning around New Zealand&#39;s relative social decline, which has been highlighted in the OECD report &#39;Society At A Glance&#39;, is to celebrate success and achievement in education and business, says ACT MP Heather Roy.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand has plummeted from overall third in the OECD&#39;s economic rankings in 1950 to the bottom third today, and we are also falling behind in social indicators&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;This latest survey&#39;s data, collected from 1994 to 1999, exposes New Zealanders&#39; distrust of parliament and the public service.</p>
<p>&quot;MPs who vote for self-serving retrospective legislation, while tens of thousands wait for basic government services like healthcare and housing, are rightly seen as abusing their political power.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not surprising that Kiwis distrust the public service. Caring and hard-working people on the front lines are often frustrated by back-office bureaucrats who don&#39;t understand the desperate situations their &#39;clients&#39; face.</p>
<p>&quot;While the OECD survey shows us doing relatively well when it came to &#39;material deprivation&#39;, we should be aware that one in ten Kiwis were behind in paying bills, and one in five could not have a week of holiday away from home.</p>
<p>&quot;If Labour is serious about their goal of getting New Zealand back in the top half of the OECD they would:</p>
<p>* Introduce a low flat tax, to let working Kiwis keep more of what they earn * Support Rodney Hide&#39;s Regulatory Responsibility Bill when it comes before Parliament. * Give parents real choice over the education their children receive, with a funding entitlement which can be spent at any school, used to pay for other educational activities like tutoring, or to assist with special needs.</p>
<p>&quot;The path to a better life begins with a quality education, and the key to improving our material wellbeing is encouraging hard work and enterprise. We should support achievement as proudly in education and business as we do in sport.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand&#39;s a great place to live, but ACT refuses to sit by while we risk sliding behind our neighbours. I am in Parliament to promote self-reliance, prosperity and excellence - a prescription which can take Kiwis back to the top half of the OECD&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
