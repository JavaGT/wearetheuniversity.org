<p>Government must address “student accommodation crisis” in Wellington</p>
<p>Students are today calling on the government to increase the level and eligibility of allowances in light of an accommodation crisis among first year students at Victoria University.</p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington Deputy Vice Chancellor David McKay described the situation in relation to first year student accommodation as a ‘crisis’ at the University Council meeting on Monday. Chancellor Tim Beaglehole also reported to the Council in the public session of the meeting that concerned parents are withdrawing their students from the University because they cannot afford a place to live.</p>
<p>“It’s no secret that high accommodation costs and housing shortages are shutting students out of university study” said Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association President Geoff Hayward.</p>
<p>“Government must urgently and decisively address this crisis by increasing the level of allowances paid to students and introduce a universal living allowance, for all students.”</p>
<p>“It is simply not good enough that students and potential students are being priced out of university study. I worry for those students, as well as those who care about the welfare of those students, including concerned parents and caregivers.”</p>
