<p>Breast cancer surgery by postcode</p>
<p>National&#39;s Associate Health spokeswoman Dr Jackie Blue is concerned that Kiwi women suffering from breast cancer are getting treatment by postcode instead of the best possible care.</p>
<p>Dr Blue is commenting on results from 17 DHBs that provided information on almost 9000 breast cancer surgical cases performed over the past five years.</p>
<p>&quot;The inconsistency in breast cancer surgical practice in New Zealand is quite startling,&quot; says Dr Blue.</p>
<p>&quot;Across the board the mastectomy rate was 50% but there were marked variations between DHBs ranging from 28% to 99%.</p>
<p>&quot;There seemed to be no link with the number of cases each DHB treated and mastectomy rates.</p>
<p>Wairarapa DHB treated only a small number of surgical cases (141) with a mastectomy rate of only 30% - in contrast, Hutt DHB treated 651 cases with a mastectomy rate of 83%.</p>
<p>The converse also applied. MidCentral DHB treated only 226 cases with an astonishing mastectomy rate of 99% but Waikato, which treated 1,478 cases, had a mastectomy rate of 30%, and Bay of Plenty which treated 874 cases had a 28% mastectomy rate.</p>
<p>&quot;The results were all over the place,&quot; says Dr Blue.</p>
<p>&quot;I had hoped that with the breast screening programme, which has run for the past eight years, we would be seeing consistently lower mastectomy rates across the country.</p>
<p>&quot;What has the Ministry of Health and Labour&#39;s two Ministers of Health been doing for the past eight years?</p>
<p>&quot;Kiwi women need the reassurance that wherever they live they are getting the best surgical procedure for their cancer, rather than treatment by postcode&quot;.</p>
