<p><strong>Friday, 2 February 2007, 8:36 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Survey proves ‘20 free’ empty promise</p>
<p>A survey showing that only one in five early childhood centres will offer the Government’s ’20 hours free’ scheme shows just how flawed the policy is, says National Party Associate Education spokeswoman, Paula Bennett.</p>
<p>The Early Childhood Council (ECC) survey released today has found only 22.7% of providers surveyed will offer ’20 hours free’ at their centre.</p>
<p>“As we have said all along, the &#39;20 hours free’ promise is a cruel hoax played out on the parents of pre-schoolers.</p>
<p>“The scheme was flawed from the beginning and parents have been promised a scheme that will never be delivered.</p>
<p>“Today’s survey result is exactly as National predicted.</p>
<p>“The subsidy offered to centres to provide the scheme was never going to cover the true cost offering ’20 hours free’.</p>
<p>&quot;What Labour is offering is a basic, low-end standard of early childhood education, and providers are very clearly telling the Minister that they will not compromise on quality by offering &#39;20 hours free&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Ministry of Education documents released under the Official Information Act back up the Early Childhood Council’s survey and clearly show thousands of three and four-year olds will miss out on this scheme.</p>
<p>“What is most alarming to me is that thousands of pre-schoolers in areas like Manukau City, where some of our most in need families live and early childhood education uptake rates are already low, are going to miss out because their providers cannot afford to take up this scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister cannot continue to ignore the concerns of the sector which is telling him that this just will not work and he cannot ignore the concerns of thousands of parents who are now left in limbo.</p>
<p>“The Minister must front up and tell the truth: ’20 hours free’ was an empty promise.”</p>
