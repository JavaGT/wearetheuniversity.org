<p>Weapons Discovery Alarming - Mark</p>
<p>The range of serious weapons that have been found recently in the hands of criminals is deeply disturbing, says New Zealand First law and order spokesman Ron Mark.</p>
<p>Mr Mark’s comments follow the discovery of yet another cache of weapons by police during the execution of a search warrant.</p>
<p>“I am deeply concerned at the numbers and types of weapons found by police in recent months. Organised crime members are arming themselves to the teeth to commit criminal acts. The only reasons for these people to have such weapons are to commit offences and to protect their illegal activities,” said Mr Mark.</p>
<p>Aside from hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash and drugs, the inventory of destruction found by police in the last three months include:</p>
<p>- several pistols, including a silenced .22 pistol and a Glock, similar to the pistols issued to police<br>- two AK 47 assault rifles<br>- 11 stun guns<br>- a nail bomb<br>- a police issue shirt<br>- a bullet proof vest<br>- a Kevlar helmet, similar to that issued to the Police Armed Offenders Squads<br>- mace.</p>
<p>“Police must be congratulated on their work in discovering and removing these weapons from the hands of criminals. However, the multiple finds of large caches of weapons raises serious questions of how these illegal weapons are getting into the country, and in turn into the hands of dangerous criminals.</p>
<p>“Further, appropriate punishments must be served on those who break the law by obtaining these weapons. We, as a society, cannot tolerate a situation where criminals are becoming more heavily armed than our police officers,” concluded Mr Mark.</p>
