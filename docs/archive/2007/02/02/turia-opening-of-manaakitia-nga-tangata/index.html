<p>Opening of Manaakitia Nga Tangata;</p>
<p>Alternative Education Building; Whanganui</p>
<p>Friday 2 February 2007; 10am</p>
<p>Tariana Turia, Member of Parliament for Te Tai Hauauru</p>
<p>E rere kau mai, Te Awa nui<br>Mai i te kahui Maunga, ki Tangaroa<br>KO AU TE AWA, KO TE AWA KO AU!</p>
<p>The river is the beginning, the beginning for our people from the mountain to the sea. It ties us together like the umbilical cord of the unborn child.</p>
<p>I am delighted to be with you all today, on this special day when we celebrate the birth of Manaakitia Nga Tangata to strengthen our rights as tangata whenua to an education for all.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about what will be offered at Manaakitia Nga Tangata and it seems to me, the opportunity for our rangatahi to benefit from this new initiative in alternative education, will strengthen our heartbeat, will nourish the pulse of our people in our journey through life.</p>
<p>Just as our awa is our heartbeat, our source of sustenance; I hope that this new entity, will care for; will nurture; will strengthen all the young people that come through these doors.</p>
<p>You will be familiar with the concept : I am the river and the river is me.</p>
<p>The journey of education is like our river winding its way down the mountains, negotiating rapids, and reaching the sea that touches the shores of the rest of the world.</p>
<p>It is my wish today, that the experience for all those who travel through Manaakitia nga tangata will be one that also successfully bridges all rapids, flows through all challenges, and leads to the shores of a fantastic future.</p>

<p>I have really appreciated the time that I have spent with Waiora Christian Trust; with Dave Campbell; with John Coffey; with Eugene Katene, and indeed all of the staff and volunteers who give so much to make Waiora a success.</p>
<p>I say ‘success’ deliberately, because if you looked at any of the information the Government produces on alternative education you’d be looking a long time before you came across this word.</p>
<p>The Government has all sorts of definitions for alternative education – definitions which talk about young people being “alienated from education”; being “unwilling to attend a regular school” or “schools being unwilling to enrol them”.</p>
<p>Nothing that I know about Wairoa Christian Trust fits that mould – of alienation; of being unwilling; the ‘faults and minuses’ definition.</p>
<p>Instead, I prefer the definition offered by the dictionary – of alternative creating another possibility; of activities that depart from or challenge traditional norms.</p>
<p>We are in a position in Aotearoa right at this time, in which the numbers of students turning to other possibilities is growing at an unprecedented rate.</p>
<p>As at 1 July 2006, there were 1178 alternative education students; and at least 200 different alternative education providers. And according to Ministry data, almost half of the students are Maori.</p>
<p>There must be real possibilities; new ways of seeing and being; which respond to the unique opportunities required by our young people.</p>
<p>Over this last year we have been trying to raise attention to the urgent need to ensure our young people are gainfully employed.</p>
<p>We have shared the grief that 11% of the Maori workforce are unemployed.</p>
<p>We have wondered why it is, that there is such an unacceptably high rate of suspensions and expulsions attached to Maori young people.</p>
<p>And we have challenged the Government to account for the fact that only 47% of Māori school-leavers finish school with qualifications higher than NCEA Level One; compared to a massive 74% for European; 87% for Asian.</p>
<p>In simple terms, that’s one out of every two rangatahi, leaving school with insufficient skills and qualifications to achieve their fullest potential.</p>
<p>We, the Maori Party, have called for new solutions; for activities that may challenge traditional norms – ideas and initiatives that will enable our young people to grow.</p>
<p>And yet the response has been resoundingly negative. We have been labelled as aligned to this or that party; to this or that political history – without anyone taking a breath, standing back, and thinking….what will work, what will make the difference.</p>
<p>That is why I am so thrilled to be here today.</p>
<p>You at Manaakitia nga tangata have been prepared to take the risk, to face the challenge, and to stand up and make the difference.</p>
<p>You have recognized that we need to plan to nurture leadership mo Whanganui, mā Whanganui.</p>
<p>You have built on the strengths of your organisation, your experiences, your people.</p>
<p>You have identified your solutions and you have given them life to make them work.</p>
<p>When Manaakitia Trust went into recess, many may have thought the good ideas were closed down with the venue.</p>
<p>But what you have done is to breathe new life into the basis that was established here with the whakaairo programme, the harakeke, the arts.</p>
<p>We have been limited in our ability to preserve and protect the art of mahi whakaairo when our closest school has been through Hinengakau in Taumarunui.</p>
<p>You have picked up that challenge, and are making it possible for the door to be open to our community to come back to a space where carving and weaving and our arts can be redeveloped and revitalized.</p>
<p>You are also acknowledging the taonga that have been in this space with your generosity in handing them back to Te Atihaunui a Paparangi.</p>
<p>And you are making it possible for the whanau who were part of those carvings to be included again.</p>
<p>In essence, you have indeed breathed new life into your vision; you are inspiring hope in the rangatahi that will flow through these doors, and you are setting a standard of respect and innovation that will stand you in good stead for your future.</p>
<p>That model is the framework for educational aspirations to be met. You are providing creative solutions which mark alternative education as an investment in the lives of young people – rather than a cost that needs to be managed.</p>
<p>The Maori Party salutes your initiative, and we will do all that we can, to ensure that the students who participate in your programme are not disadvantaged by the state’s stubborn refusal to consider options outside of the box.</p>
<p>We have challenged the Government to increase the funding to alternative education to ensure all your students are offered the full range of possibilities.</p>
<p>We believe that sufficient resourcing in quality alternative education will save the country from having to pay out later in social rescue programmes; in income support; or through the long arms of the justice system. And yet still, the funding has remained static.</p>
<p>We are appalled that currently providers like yourselves have been starved of funding; are therefore unable to employ qualified staff or be fully resourced – and so therefore these kids, our kids, miss out.</p>
<p>The costs of maintaining a programme like Manaakitia Nga Tangata far outweigh the costs of not having them. The cost to society is huge.</p>
<p>Against such a context, it is even more remarkable that you are doing what you can, to improve numeracy and literacy skills; to pass on life skills; to wrap loving arms around your students – to build hope.</p>
<p>The greatest challenge facing our time, is to find positive ways of engaging our young people in productive learning environments.</p>
<p>I absolutely commend you all for your courage; your compassion and your creativity in creating a space for rangatahi to succeed.</p>
<p>We know, that it will not all be easy paddling from this point on. There will still be rapids to cross, shadows lurking, snags undetected.</p>
<p>But you have shown the faith and determination to survive every challenge; to thrive in the confidence of your vision.</p>
<p>Central to Nga Kai o Te Puku Tupuna, the Whanganui Iwi Education Plan, is the belief that our tamariki must feel good about being Maori.</p>
<p>I wish you all the very best in achieving that belief – and putting in place the very best quality education to understand our world; education which is viable, sustainable, effective and efficient.</p>
<p>The Maori Party is proud to honour you today; as you reach out to the sea that touches the shores of the rest of the world. Go well.</p>
<p>Tena tatou katoa.</p>
