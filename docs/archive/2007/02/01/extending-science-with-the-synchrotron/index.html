<p>Extending science with the synchrotron</p>
<p>Massey University has been awarded $500,000 by the Tertiary Education Commission to host a New Zealand Synchrotron Support Programme.</p>
<p>Professor of Structural Chemistry and Biology Geoff Jameson says the successful application will facilitate New Zealand scientists’ access to the A$220 million Australian Synchrotron facility, to be launched this year in Melbourne. Massey will act on behalf of Auckland, Waikato, Victoria, Canterbury, Lincoln and Otago universities.</p>
<p>A synchrotron is a large machine (about the size of a football field) that creates beams of extremely intense light (a million times brighter than the sun or conventional lab equipment) that are channelled into workstations and which can be used simultaneously.</p>
<p>Professor Jameson says the synchrotron will feature 10 world-class beams that will benefit many areas of research across the University, including structural biology, nanomaterials research, soil science, and medical imaging in the veterinary school. He says it is very complementary to Massey’s Nuclear Magnetic Resonance suite and X-ray crystallography facilities.</p>
<p>“It’s a truly multi-use piece of equipment. It will transform basic science and applied science as well. It can be used not just for blue skies research but also in fields like engineering and technology. With any process which needs light, the Synchrotron will do it better – from hard X-ray light through to infrared.&quot;</p>
<p>In 2004, Massey committed $450,000 as part of more than $10 million contributed by a consortium of New Zealand universities and several Crown Research Institutes, in partnership with the Ministry of Research Science and Technology.</p>

<p>Professor Jameson says the Synchrotron Support Programme will provide networking to help scientists access the facility, to negotiate research time at the facility, and to ensure that universities and institutes make the most of their investment in the facility. The programme will also provide seed money to projects that will use the Synchrotron and funding for scientists to travel to Melbourne.</p>
<p>The application to the Tertiary Education Commission (for the Innovation and Development Fund) by Massey’s Research Management Services, under the direction of Michael Peters, is the first collective funding application made by universities and crown research institutes.</p>
<p>The project is one of three Massey projects awarded funding in the Commission’s latest round. The other two are: - The establishment of an inter-university Mäori academic network to be led by Professor Mason Durie.</p>
<p>- The co-ordination and implementation of e-learning guidelines across the tertiary sector led by Gordon Suddaby.</p>
