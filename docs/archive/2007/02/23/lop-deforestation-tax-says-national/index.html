<p>Hon Nick Smith MP<br>National Party Climate Change Spokesman</p>
<p>23 February 2007</p>
<p>Lop deforestation tax, says National</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s desperate attempt today to bail out of its public relations disaster over deforestation will not succeed until it categorically rules out its proposed deforestation tax, says National&#39;s Climate Change spokesman, Nick Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s announcement is just another chapter in the Government&#39;s policy debacle over climate change.</p>
<p>&quot;They proposed the option of a deforestation tax in December, but it is causing such an uproar amongst landowners that they are distancing themselves from the proposal before the consultation process is over.</p>
<p>&quot;The disaster of the deforestation tax is that many landowners are starting up their chainsaws early, making for reports of a massacre of New Zealand forests in areas like the central North Island and Canterbury.</p>
<p>&quot;The Prime Minister&#39;s promise of New Zealand being carbon neutral is a sick joke when she is presiding over the first deforestation in half a century.</p>
<p>&quot;The tax looks set to join the Government&#39;s earlier failed proposals of a fart tax and carbon tax.</p>
<p>&quot;National calls on the Government to scrap the deforestation tax and cap.</p>
<p>&quot;The answer is not regulation and taxes, but changing the investment climate for forestry by enabling them a return on carbon credits.</p>
<p>&quot;That is why National wants a tradeable emissions permit system established as soon as possible.&quot;</p>
