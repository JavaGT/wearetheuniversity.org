<p>Minister In Denial Over Maori Education - Roy</p>
<p>Heather Roy Thursday, 15 February 2007 Press Releases - Education</p>
<p>The Minister of Education is in denial that Labour policies are failing thousands of Maori children, says ACT Education Spokesman, Heather Roy.</p>
<p>&quot;In response to my question in Parliament this afternoon, the Minister refused to accept that statistics on Maori education show a crisis of truancy, underachievement and lost potential&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;When 7% of Maori children regularly truant, and over half leave school without a qualification, we need new ideas.</p>
<p>&quot;Minister Maharey dismissed categorically ACT&#39;s suggestion of School Choice - which would put parents and teachers in control, by giving them the ability to choose how to get the best possible education for their children.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of the government paying schools, they would give parents their children&#39;s share of education funding, and parents could choose which school will best teach their child.</p>
<p>&quot;Maori communities would be able to choose - or start - schools that meet their specific needs.</p>
<p>&quot;School Choice encourages teachers to meet the needs of students, instead of the demands of Ministry bureaucrats.</p>
<p>&quot;Wealthy Kiwis already have choice - they can buy into the &#39;right&#39; school zones or afford private tuition fees. Those most in need - largely Maori and Pasifika families - are missing out.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT is sick of Maori education being just another set of sad statistics that Labour lie about. Maori children have the most to gain from their parents being given real choice, and real control.</p>
<p>&quot;Locking children into a uniform state system is failing thousands of Maori children. Labour needs to end their denial and put parents and teachers in control, instead of politicians and education bureaucrats&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
