<p><strong>Thursday, 15 February 2007, 12:14 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Colin King MP<br>National Party Associate Education Spokesman<br>(Trades Training)<br>15 February 2007</p>
<p>Trades training must start in schools</p>
<p>If the Labour Government wants more young people to enter trades training and apprenticeships it must address the technology curriculum crisis in our schools, says National Party Associate Education spokesman Colin King.</p>
<p>Schools are struggling to attract qualified and trained technology teachers, leaving in limbo students who want to progress on to further trade training.</p>
<p>Business New Zealand and the PPTA have fronted for Parliament’s Education and Science Select Committee and told members there is no clear, shared vision on the delivery of technology education in schools.</p>
<p>“Technology education in schools has been ignored for too long.</p>
<p>&quot;If we want to encourage students to get into trades, we need a stronger and more vibrant curriculum that provides a real and practical link to on-going training.</p>
<p>“Labour’s grand plans for apprenticeships and trades training will go nowhere unless we get the basics right in school and offer students a clear path.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Education must develop a comprehensive, concise curriculum that provides a pathway from school to training, and gives teachers, students and parents some faith that the Labour Government recognises trades as a valuable and rewarding career option.”</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
