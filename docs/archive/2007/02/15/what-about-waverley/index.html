<p>Chester Borrows<br>National Party MP for Whanganui</p>
<p>15 February 2007</p>
<p>What about Waverley?</p>
<p>Labour is trumpeting a $189,000 funding boost for two Wanganui high schools in a cynical attempt to divert attention from the crisis-ridden Waverley High School just 50 kilometres down the road, says the National Party MP for Whanganui, Chester Borrows.</p>
<p>&quot;Now is not the time for Labour MP Jill Pettis to be issuing smug, self-serving releases about education funding when it is clear there are some extremely difficult issues facing my electorate.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an unsubtle attempt to distract people from the Waverley High School disaster.</p>
<p>&quot;The Labour Government has known about the problems at Waverley since 2002 but turned a blind eye.</p>
<p>&quot;Jill Pettis was the local MP from 1996, and claims to have expertise in education, including working in the Ministry of Education&#39;s Regional Office in Wanganui before entering Parliament, yet she has never been to a public meeting on the Waverley crisis and obviously failed to act when she was the electorate MP.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we have a school in disarray and a community with children who have missed out on quality education for over four years.</p>
<p>&quot;For some of those students, that is almost their entire secondary schooling.</p>
<p>&quot;If Jill Pettis was serious about quality education, she would put her energy into halting the tragic decline of Waverley High School, not issuing self-serving press releases touting funding allocations for other schools.&quot;</p>
