<p>Improving Maori Participation In Early Childhood Education</p>
<p>New Zealand First Maori Affairs spokesperson Pita Paraone has welcomed the Maori Affairs select committee&#39;s confirmation of his terms of reference for an inquiry into Maori participation in early childhood education.</p>
<p>The inquiry will include an examination of economic and social factors, funding issues, barriers and family influences affecting Maori participation rates in various early education programmes. It also includes an inquiry into ways to increase and enhance Maori participation.</p>
<p>&quot;This inquiry recognises the important role early childhood education and parents play in establishing strong future learning behaviours for school and beyond. We need to ensure that more New Zealand children, including Maori, are benefiting from a good start in their early, formative years,&quot; said Mr Paraone.</p>
<p>&quot;Educational attainment is a matter of encompassing all facets of Maori wellbeing. Unfortunately, various social indices still show Maori some way behind the rest of the population, and recent Maori education statistics have been cause for alarm. Truancy rates are a great deal higher for Maori and over half of male Maori students are leaving school without a qualification.</p>
<p>&quot;Education is the key to social and economic advancement, and this inquiry would provide a good opportunity to find ways to improve Maori involvement in early education,&quot; concluded Mr Paraone.</p>
