<p><strong>Tuesday, 20 March 2007, 12:58 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology">Auckland University of Technology</a></strong></p>
<p>Better business habits from a young age</p>
<p>It&#39;s never too young to learn about business ethics and a group of Auckland school children now know the difference between what&#39;s good and bad in enterprise.</p>
<p>The young art entrepreneurs, aged six to 13, are selling their creative wares at the Auckland Festival AK07 Spiegelmarket being held at Britomart&#39;s Red Square this Sunday, but these kids won&#39;t be trying to swing one over the punters.</p>
<p>Following the advice of AUT University&#39;s Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE AUT) they understand what it means to be good in business and who gets affected by bad decision-making.</p>
<p>Up for sale are arts and crafts made by the young creatives and each stall will have its own brand, complete with business logos designed by the students.</p>
<p>Auckland Festival AK07 education co-ordinator Clare Carmody says the Spiegelmarket is a chance to see what Auckland&#39;s brightest school children have on offer.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m so impressed by the kids&#39; ideas and their artwork. It&#39;s incredible and Aucklanders should get down to the market to support them, and buy some good art in the process.&quot;</p>
<p>She says the partnership with AUT University and its SIFE students is the perfect fit for the Auckland Festival&#39;s first Spiegelmarket.</p>
<p>&quot;AUT and its business students have a proven history of running positive community projects. By using the skills of a tertiary education provider and SIFE AUT the workshops have been the best possible experience for the kids.&quot;</p>
<p>Clare also has some simple advice for prospective shoppers: &quot;Bring cash, and lots of it.&quot;</p>

<p>SIFE AUT worked alongside Clare and the Auckland Festival crew to run two Sunday workshops. As well as business ethics, they taught marketing and branding, and advised their young protégés how to create a logo that best reflects them.</p>
<p>SIFE AUT president Ineke Jacobs says the learning experience was mutual.</p>
<p>&quot;These kids have very good ideas and a good understanding of how to run their own business,&quot; she said. &quot;They all had a lot to offer and we walked away inspired by them. I can&#39;t wait to see what they come up with on Sunday.&quot;</p>
<p>Ineke says Aucklanders need to plan their day this Sunday and get to Red Square at Britomart early so they don&#39;t miss out.</p>
<p>AUT community relations manager Ian Leader says New Zealand&#39;s youngest artists are more business savvy than ever and the time is now to hone their skills.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s been a privilege to see the melting pot of talent in these kids, some as young as six,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ve been privileged at AUT to be involved in the Spiegelmarket and to guide New Zealand&#39;s next stars further towards being confident business entrepreneurs as well as talented artisans.&quot;</p>
<p>The Spiegelmarket is based on successful projects at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre (Australia), The Young New Brighton Festival (UK) and the TV2KidsFestival (Christchurch).</p>
<p>Entrance to the Spiegelmarket open to the public and is free. A percentage of the profits go to the SPCA with the rest going to Auckland&#39;s youngest businesses.</p>
