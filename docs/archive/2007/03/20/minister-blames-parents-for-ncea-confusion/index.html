<p>Minister blames parents for NCEA confusion</p>
<p>Education Minister Steve Maharey is now trying to blame parents for the confusion and concern over NCEA, says National&#39;s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister&#39;s answers to questions in the House today reveal his true thoughts on NCEA.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey wants to paint the picture that it&#39;s only parents who are concerned about NCEA, and that their concerns should be dismissed because they simply don&#39;t understand it.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s an insult to parents, but also the many Principals and teachers who continue to raise legitimate concerns about NCEA.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister is all over the place in his rebuttal over NCEA criticisms.</p>
<p>&quot;First he tries to hold the line that NCEA is a success, but in the next breath talks about the need to &#39;restore confidence&#39; in NCEA.</p>
<p>&quot;If things are going so swimmingly, why are schools looking for alternatives and why is he aiming to &#39;restore confidence&#39;?</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand school students, worried parents and the schools which have gone public with their concerns over the system should be listened to.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as the Minister is deaf to legitimate concerns, our country runs the risk of developing of a two-tier exam system for kiwi students.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time he owned up to the problem and stopped pretending that it&#39;s just in the minds of concerned parents who simply want the best for their children.&quot;</p>
