<p>Nine Weeks Of Herceptin - The Cheap Option For Kiwi Women</p>
<p>Heather Roy<br>Tuesday, 20 March 2007<br>Press Releases - Health</p>
<p>Provisional approval from District Health Boards for a nine-week course of Herceptin is a cost-cutting measure that will fail thousands of Kiwi women with HER2-positive breast cancer, says ACT Health Spokesman Heather Roy.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a great deal of disappointment that approval for a full 12-month course of Herceptin has not been announced - as it has been in 23 other OECD countries including Australia&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;Offering a nine-week course will be seen as cost cutting by those suffering from a very serious condition. Kiwi women with HER2-positive breast cancer deserve the highest standard of treatment - and that means a full 12-month course of Herceptin.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government should explain why, when one tax dollar in five is being spent on health, we still can&#39;t offer women the same standard of treatment they&#39;d receive across the Tasman.</p>
<p>&quot;Svend Petersen, Managing Director of Roche Products (New Zealand) Ltd, pointed out last month that &#39;only a full year-long course is proven to save lives&#39; and that &#39;New Zealand is the only country considering funding for nine weeks, and this is based purely on financial reasons&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;PHARMAC and the Government must be honest with the public about whether or not the nine week short course of Herceptin for HER2-positive breast cancer sufferers is a trial. Trials are conducted under very different circumstances than treatments.</p>
<p>&quot;We should be doing more for Kiwi women affected with breast cancer than crossing our fingers and offering them a cheap option&quot;, Mrs Roy said.</p>
