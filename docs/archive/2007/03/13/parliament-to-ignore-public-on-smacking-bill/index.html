<p>Parliament To Ignore Public On Smacking Bill</p>
<p>Rodney Hide<br>Tuesday, 13 March 2007<br>Press Releases - Other</p>
<p>ACT Leader Rodney Hide says he is disappointed that the &quot;Anti-Smacking Bill&quot; appears to have the numbers to pass into law.</p>
<p>&quot;The people of New Zealand have not been consulted on this proposal. Once again, Parliament is arrogantly foisting its view on the rest of the country&quot;, Mr Hide said.</p>
<p>&quot;I asked the people of Epsom what they think in a scientific poll, and they are overwhelmingly opposed.</p>
<p>&quot;If those MPs supporting the Bill have actually asked their constituents&#39; opinions, I challenge them to release the results.</p>
<p>&quot;Where is the openness and accountability in passing a law that would affect thousands of families - without even asking what people think?&quot; Mr Hide asked.</p>
<p>Poll Question and result as follows:</p>
<p>There has been a lot of discussion recently about the so called &quot;anti-smacking bill&quot; before parliament. Do you support the proposed changes to Section 59 of the Crimes Act, which will abolish the use of parental force for the purpose of correction?</p>
<p>Yes 21%<br>No 68%<br>Don&#39;t Know 11%<br>Refused 1%</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
