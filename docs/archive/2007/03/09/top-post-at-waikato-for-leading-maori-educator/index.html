<p>Media Release 9 March 2007<br>Eminent education leader appointed to top post at Waikato University</p>
<p>Internationally renowned researcher in Māori and indigenous education, Professor Linda Tuhiwai Te Rina Smith (Ngāti Awa,Ngāti Porou) has been appointed Pro Vice-Chancellor (Māori) at the University of Waikato.</p>

<p>&quot;The University is extremely fortunate to have someone of Professor Smith&#39;s calibre take up this important role.</p>

<p>Professor Smith has a strong interdisciplinary research and teaching background, primarily in the field of education, including Māori and indigenous education, and the sociology and history of education.</p>
