<p>AUT University announces Alumni public relations Hall of Fame</p>
<p>AUT University, in association with leading public relations consultancy, Porter Novelli, announces the launch of New Zealand’s first Public Relations Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Alumni from AUT University (and its previous incarnations: AIT and ATI) will be evaluated on their contribution to the public relations profession by a judging panel of leading practitioners. These include PRINZ lifetime member Cedric Allan; General Manager, NZ Public Affairs for AMP, Jane Anderson; Director of Corporate Affairs for Meridian Energy, Alan Seay; AUT Curriculum Leader in Communication Studies, Joseph Peart and chaired by Porter Novelli’s Managing Director, Jane Sweeney.</p>
<p>The panel of high profile judges will review the depth and range of achievements of AUT University alumni with public relations expertise.</p>
<p>Two categories have been created for the Hall of Fame. The Golden Scroll, for those who have had more than 10 years experience in the industry, and the Rising Star, for those who’ve been in the PR profession for at least five years.</p>
<p>Up to four people a year, who have made notable and impressive contributions to the profession, will be inducted into the Hall of Fame at an annual event, the first of which will be held in early May.</p>
<p>Jane Sweeney says the partnership marks the continuation of the close relationship between AUT University and Porter Novelli.</p>
<p>&quot;Porter Novelli is thrilled to deepen its existing relationship with AUT University in launching the AUT University Public Relations Hall of Fame. For over 20 years now AUT University has been providing corporations, organisations and PR agencies with world-class practitioners. They start out as graduates in &#39;work ready&#39; mode, hungry to make their mark, and many now lead large teams of communications professionals, with many also going on to take up senior management positions.</p>
<p>“As leaders in the communications field, we wanted to recognise and reward excellence in PR practice, and show our appreciation of the vital role AUT University’s School of Communications Studies plays in providing high calibre practitioners,” says Jane.</p>
<p>AUT University has trained some of New Zealand’s most high profile practitioners who have gone on to receive national and international accolades for their achievements.</p>
<p>AUT University’s Curriculum Leader of Public Relations, Senior Lecturer Joseph Peart believes the AUT University Public relations Hall of Fame, in association with Porter Novelli, will be a benchmark for industry excellence.</p>
<p>“We are grateful to Porter Novelli for another innovation,” he says. “It fits with the creativity we foster, which began with a student-operated PR agency working for charities and continues with the student society of future practitioners.”</p>
<p>AUT University’s PR Alumni Chapter was launched last year, with support from Porter Novelli.</p>
