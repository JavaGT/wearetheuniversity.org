<p>Anti-design for designers</p>
<p>Dutch designer Gert Jan Leusink will visit Massey’s Wellington campus to talk about his experience in the early years of Droog design. Droog is a collective since 1993 that re-thinks industrial design.</p>
<p>Droog’s products consist of common, industrial or recycled materials resulting in close-to-home objects that deliver a social commentary with a highly individual character – be it mischievous, spunky, puckish or coy. In Dutch, droog means “dry” (as in &quot;dry wit&quot;), and unadorned or simple.</p>
<p>Massey design lecturer Matthijs Siljee says Droog design is described as anti-utopian, or anti-design. “It looks at the gritty parts of life, such as wet bathmats and a chair that you shape by hitting it with a hammer.”</p>
<p>Gert Jan Leusink’s talk will cover the background to the birth of Droog design from a sub-culture to commercial success and the role of industrial design for the economy and culture in the Netherlands and abroad.</p>
<p>Mr Leusink will also talk about his latest project, bliin. As Droog design is about identity in the material world, bliin is about virtual identity. Bliin (<a href="http://bliin.com">http://bliin.com</a>) is a real-time social networking service where users can share experiences – pictures, videos, audio and text – on a map.</p>
<p>Gert Jan Leusink will speak at 1:30pm on Wednesday 4 April, at the Museum Building theatrette, Massey University, Buckle St. Entry is free.</p>
<p>His visit to New Zealand is sponsored by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the<br>Netherlands, Massey University and the Designers’ Institute of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Droog: Dutch Design Showcase is on at TheNewDowse in Lower Hutt until 15 April.</p>
