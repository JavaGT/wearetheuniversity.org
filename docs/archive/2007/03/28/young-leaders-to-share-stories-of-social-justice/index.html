<p>Young Leaders to Share Stories of Social Justice in Action at Maxim Institute Forum 2007</p>
<p>Today’s leaders will hear from the leaders of tomorrow when journalist and storyteller, Rob Harley, interviews three young New Zealanders about their experience of starting effective community projects at the Maxim Institute Forum 2007 – Pursuing Social Justice in New Zealand on Friday 30 March.</p>
<p>Through their stories, these young people hope to inspire fresh confidence that there are still lots of Kiwis who care enough to invest their own time and resources in helping others. Mari Day, Te Waka McLeod and Billie Paea each have a unique story that will challenge and encourage delegates.</p>
<p>“It’s just about responding to people’s needs”, says Mari Day, whose concern for underage girls trapped in prostitution motivated her and her friend Erin Lucas to research what help was available. “We realised there was a desperate need for a place in Auckland where young girls could go instead of working the streets,” says Miss Day. Thanks to their initiative and persistence, community organisation Iosis, Housing New Zealand, and many willing and dedicated volunteers, the Auckland police now have a safe place to send young girls involved in prostitution.</p>
<p>The success of this initiative was a catalyst for City Lights, a four-day event where hundreds of young people volunteer their time to help locals in South Auckland. They focus on helping those who are socially excluded by running holiday programmes for children in CYFS custody, helping out with soup kitchens, working with elderly people, DIY painting and building, and much more, with a growing number of projects continuing throughout the year.</p>

<p>In 2006, 19 year-old Te Waka McLeod, as part of the City Lights team, approached Dingwall Children’s Home and offered to spend four days running a holiday programme for the foster children. The programme included games, sports, sausage sizzles and surprise activities, with local community and church groups providing the necessary resources. Te Waka says, “It was so successful that Dingwall invited us to come back and spend time with the children on a regular basis. It is now a permanent feature in their monthly calendar, providing fun and creative opportunities that these children would not have otherwise experienced.”</p>
<p>Billie Paea was instrumental in founding the Dziah dance crew and the Dziah to Dance programme in Otara, Manukau City. Today Billie and his team connect with up to 500 young people each week, running low-fee dance classes, after-school programmes and mentoring and training promising dancers. Dziah are entirely self-funding and were thrilled to come second in the World Hip Hop Championships in 2006.</p>
<p>“We love sharing our passion for dance with young people, and in the process offering them a positive alternative to a life of gangs and drug abuse. It’s great to be able to encourage kids that their dreams can become a reality,” says Billie Paea.</p>
<p>Rob Harley says, “It is fitting that the Maxim Institute Forum 2007 will conclude with a focus on the leaders of tomorrow and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. For social justice to thrive in New Zealand, our future leaders must be committed to strengthening and growing community action and I look forward to helping these forerunners share their stories.”</p>
<p>The evening programme will take place in the Great Hall, of the Auckland Town Hall, THE EDGE® during dinner. Community Police Officer, Nick Tuitasi, will MC the evening and Rob Harley will interview the three young leaders.</p>
