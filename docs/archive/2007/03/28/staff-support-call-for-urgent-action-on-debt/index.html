<p>University staff support call for urgent action to curb mounting student debt</p>
<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) has joined the call for urgent government intervention to deal with the mounting level of student debt, saying that students, just like any other group of citizens, should have sufficient levels of income to live while studying. This follows the announcement this morning that the total level of debt for New Zealand students has reached $9 billion.</p>
<p>AUS National President, Professor Nigel Haworth, said that he was shocked that student debt has reached the $9 billion mark, adding that it represents a significant failure by New Zealanders to support adequately students through their tertiary education.</p>
<p>Professor Haworth said that university staff had consistently expressed concerns about the effect of high student loans and debt on students’ access to university education and on their learning experience. “It is clear that increasing access to adequate living allowances for students and lowering student fees would considerably reduce the level of total student debt,” he said. “University staff believe these changes are necessary to ensure the high educational standards needed for a knowledge-based society.”</p>
<p>While recognising that the Government has increased support for students through measures such as the interest-free loans policy, Professor Haworth said that the AUS supported calls by the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations for the Government to deal with the drivers of student debt and implement measures such as a universal living allowance for all students.</p>
