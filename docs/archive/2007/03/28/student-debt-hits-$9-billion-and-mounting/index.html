<p>Student debt hits $9 billion and mounting</p>
<p>Concerned students from all around the country are today voicing their concern at student debt reaching a staggering nine billion dollars.</p>
<p>“Student debt continues to climb and the Labour government’s promised increases in allowances haven’t occurred” said Joey Randall, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.</p>
<p>A significant proportion of student debt is due to the simple fact that most students need to borrow in order to live, pay rent, eat and turn up to class.</p>
<p>A recent OECD report acknowledged that “the current system does not address to the full extent the financial barriers students face in accessing tertiary education”.</p>
<p>While it reported that student support was the highest in the OECD this was due to government loans being 407% the OECD average, money that will mainly be repaid.</p>
<p>Student allowance funding dropped from 15.5% of Government Tertiary Education spending in 1999/2000 to on 10.2 % in 2004/2005. During this time loans spending increase from 22% to 26.8%.</p>
<p>NZUSA calls upon the government to immediately deliver on their election promise to increase access to allowances to 50% of all eligible students and to progressively introduce a living allowance for all students.</p>
