<p>Victoria students are getting sick of begging!</p>
<p>The announcement of total student debt reaching nine billion dollars is a disappointing commentary on a flawed student loan system, according to Victoria University of Wellington Students&#39; Association President Geoff Hayward.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s no surprise that in spite of student loans being interest free has failed to actually tackle the triggers of debt, in fact when one looks at how much of the 9 billion owed was for living costs, we find that students cannot survive unless they rely upon their student loan&quot;</p>
<p>Approximately 40% of the nine billion owed is from students borrowing for living costs. Each student can borrow up to $150 each week for living costs. Furthermore, in spite of Government measures to increase entitlements, 29% of all tertiary students are entitled to student allowances. Because of these, more students are forced to take out a student loan to survive while studying</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s legislative begging. It&#39;s a white collar means to force students to take on debt, where no other group of society would be expected to. Furthermore, it&#39;s that same debt that affects people&#39;s life choices: starting a family, buying a home or starting a business. All of this because they had to take out a loan to avoid death while studying. It&#39;s time that the Government once and for all end a shameful practice, and install universal student allowances for all students.&quot;</p>

<p>In Wellington, the costs of living while studying make the situation even worse.</p>
<p>&quot;Students are struggling to find accommodation, and when they do, they have to pay between $120 and $130 a week in rent. No wonder why students are deciding to not study at Victoria. Not only must we install a universal student allowance, we must pay allowances at a rate that will reflect the true cost of studying in Wellington. No one should be forced to beg to survive.&quot;</p>
