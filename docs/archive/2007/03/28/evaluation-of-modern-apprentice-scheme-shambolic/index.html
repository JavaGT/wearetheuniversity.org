<p>Evaluation of Modern Apprentice scheme shambolic</p>
<p>Government officials have admitted they have no way of measuring completion rates for their much-celebrated Modern Apprentice scheme, says National’s Associate Education spokesman, Colin King.</p>
<p>“At this morning’s Education and Science Select Committee, Tertiary Education Commission officials admitted they had no way of measuring the completion rates on the Modern Apprenticeship scheme.</p>
<p>“This scheme has been running for seven years, under a Labour Government that has invested millions of dollars but with no way of seeing if they are getting value for money.</p>
<p>“Instead, we see the scheme trotted out periodically for ‘feel good’ media on apprenticeships.</p>
<p>&quot;Celebrating the 3000 apprentices that have graduated needs to be seen in context of the number that enrolled and failed.</p>
<p>“How can the public possibly know that taxpayer dollars are being spent well, or if this scheme is a success, if the Government and officials continue to dodge questions over completion rates?</p>
<p>“The Government invested an extra $34 million into the Modern Apprentice scheme last year, and with that increased investment must come accountability.</p>
<p>“Labour has no idea how the programme is operating, how many people are dropping out of it, or how the coordinators are spending the taxpayers’ funding they receive.</p>
<p>“It is time the Tertiary Education Minister fronted up and explained just where taxpayer money is going, and how many of his modern apprentices are dropping out.”</p>
