<p>Marching Forward</p>
<p>Heather Roy<br>Saturday, 17 March 2007<br>Speeches - Other</p>
<p>Speech to Upper South Regional Conference, Scenic Circle Cotswold Hotel,<br>Christchurch, Saturday 17 March 2007.</p>
<p>We meet here today at a time when ACT has never been more relevant to the<br>future of our country.</p>
<p>In today&#39;s competitive and globalising world New Zealand&#39;s place is not<br>assured. Through the decline in our world standing over the past decades,<br>we can no longer afford to stand idly by.</p>
<p>We have become victims of fate, rather than pro-active creators of our own<br>future. Successive governments have failed to set goals for our country.<br>Worse still successive governments have failed to be accountable for their<br>failure.</p>
<p>That has to change.</p>
<p>In a speech along similar lines, Peter Shirtcliffe, that great business<br>leader and inspiration for ACT, made the telling point that:</p>
<p>&quot;What gets measured gets done.&quot;</p>
<p>Peter told us then, and it&#39;s as relevant today, any enterprise moves<br>forward because of its goals. Goals keep us together and heading in the<br>same direction. Without goals we settle for the status quo. They set a<br>context for addressing all the vexing questions that arise once we begin<br>to take action.</p>
<p>Questions like - Where do I start? When do I know I&#39;m done? What do I do<br>next?</p>
<p>Our primary goal must be establishing world-class living standards for all<br>New Zealanders. Standards that are judged by:</p>
<p>* The income in our pockets;<br>* The quality of education, health and welfare services available to us;<br>* The quality and availability of our infrastructure and public<br>amenities;</p>

<p>To get us there we need ideas that made economic sense. New Zealand&#39;s<br>geographical isolation and our lack of mineral wealth mean we have to<br>&#39;work smart&#39; on the international stage. We don&#39;t have the luxury of<br>sloppy thinking.</p>
<p>Good government must make a commitment to ensuring economic growth to<br>reach and hold that desired standard of living.</p>
<p>Sadly, no such goals have been set and with an annual growth rate of 1.4<br>percent when the OECD average is 2.9 percent our economy is at best<br>performing poorly, at worst, a dismal failure.</p>
<p>Imagine if we had focused on achieving a growth rate of, say, 5 percent<br>and then actually achieved it?</p>
<p>Our per capita income would have soared and the government would have had<br>extra revenue for increased spending on health and education while at the<br>same time lowering tax rates and repaying debt.</p>
<p>Then we would have seen:</p>
<p>* Highly-qualified people coming to New Zealand, rather than leaving<br>* Greater opportunities for the disadvantaged<br>* Better education<br>* Less crime<br>* Less welfare dependency<br>* Better health care</p>
<p>Governments have failed in each and every one of these categories through<br>a failure to set goals and then be accountable for making sure they are<br>achieved.</p>
<p>The time has come to make New Zealand&#39;s politicians and bureaucrats fully<br>accountable.</p>
<p>Right now the chances of the current government taking responsibility for<br>anything are slim to say the least. Witness the recent trial for rape of<br>Assistant Commissioner Clint Rickards.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s not discuss the not-guilty verdict - that&#39;s not my point. But this<br>was no ordinary case as Rickards, one of three accused, was in contention<br>for the top job until the accusation of rape by Louise Nicholas.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister copped some criticism for questioning whether there<br>could have been genuine consent when three police officers took it in turn<br>to have sex with a vulnerable teenager. The fact is she was speaking for<br>the vast majority of women in this country - myself included, when she<br>made those observations - and for a substantial number of men as well.</p>
<p>So far so good, but why did she stop there? Asked about Mr Rickards&#39; four<br>promotions, after the police became aware of these horrific claims against<br>him, Miss Clark satisfied herself with a throwaway headline: &quot;The mind<br>boggles.&quot;</p>
<p>It sure does. So what about some accountability? Some Ministerial<br>accountability? Well, the Minister that presided over, and presumably<br>ticked off these endless promotions, has long since moved on to fresh<br>pastures. But, we can say with some certainty - that had he still been<br>around, there would have been no accountability, no resignation and<br>certainly no sacking.</p>
<p>To be so emphatic on this score we need look no further than the blatant<br>whitewash that has been the Graeme Burton affair. Burton, convicted of<br>murder, was released by the Parole Board despite a psychologist&#39;s report<br>saying that he was still dangerous and going on to give an account of<br>offending within the prison. The Parole Board decided in their wisdom to<br>disallow the psychologist&#39;s evidence.</p>
<p>Burton, was let out of prison by an inept parole board, and then left to<br>go about his business of hanging out with gangsters; drug taking; and<br>collecting an arsenal of weaponry, while the woeful Corrections Department<br>wrote him letters and frustrated all attempts by the police to have him<br>locked up. The price for this has been paid for with the life of an<br>innocent man and goodness knows how many more lives changed forever.</p>
<p>The simple truth is that Parole conditions are not being enforced up and<br>down the country. Widespread failure is the responsibility of this<br>government.</p>
<p>Helen Clark, last week waded in yet again, criticising Corrections and the<br>Parole Board but not a word about her Minister of Corrections, Damien<br>O&#39;Connor. He actually went on television to say he took responsibility<br>for ensuring something like this didn&#39;t happen again.</p>
<p>Excuse me, but if he can take responsibility for that, how about taking<br>responsibility for the fact it happened in the first place?</p>
<p>As I say, not likely!</p>
<p>Labour has got &quot;covering its own back&quot; down to a fine art.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why Rodney and I are so hot on accountability and that should start<br>right at the top, with the Ministers. There was a time when Ministers fell<br>on their swords, in the Westminster tradition, when their departments<br>displayed such appalling ineptitude. Remember Cave Creek?</p>
<p>And what bigger botch-up can there be than to let a &quot;thug&quot;, like Burton,<br>out to kill at will?</p>
<p>I believe in accountability. Now all we need is for enough people to<br>agree that accountability at the highest level makes sense and we will be<br>able to do something about it. I long for the day.</p>
<p>And such accountability should begin with setting goals and end with<br>achieving them.</p>
<p>The lack of goals must become a major national issue. New Zealanders need<br>to understand that our economic performance over the past decades has not<br>been anywhere near good enough. We currently occupy 22nd place out of 30<br>in the OECD when you consider GDP per capita - slipped from 3rd place<br>through most of the 1950s and 60s. All the talk by Helen Clark about the<br>top half of the OECD is irrelevant and unattainable when she sets no goals<br>at all.</p>
<p>There is but a single economic goal - a low inflation rate.</p>
<p>That&#39;s all very well but what we don&#39;t have is a standard of living goal.<br>That lack of vision is one of the reasons we find ourselves floundering.<br>Economic growth must become an explicit part of the national contract -<br>with clearly established goals government is then expected to honour in<br>return for our hard earned tax money.</p>
<p>And government must be accountable to the people for ensuring such a goal<br>is reached.</p>
<p>Imagine if our Prime Minister and Treasurer had to front up and be<br>accountable for achieving or missing an explicit Standard of Living goal.<br>You can be sure that every policy decision would be judged on its actual<br>impact on the economy, rather than for its potential for short-term<br>political advantage. Education, for example, would be treated as a key<br>input to the economy rather than as the plaything of the politically<br>correct.</p>
<p>Well run businesses set explicit goals for managers, and require them to<br>be met. I don&#39;t see why the shareholders of New Zealand Inc should be<br>expected to settle for less from our public policy managers.</p>
<p>In New Zealand most public discussion has been crippled by an obsession<br>with the division of wealth ahead of the creation of wealth.</p>
<p>The reality is that most politicians are scared to commit to any goal for<br>economic growth, even one as modest as 5 percent per year. They would<br>hesitate to commit to a real target for which they could be held<br>accountable. They would see all of the political obstacles in the way -<br>all the special interests who want to protect their own patch. They would<br>understand that policies and priorities would need to change. In short,<br>most politicians would see commitment to such a goal as heroic for the<br>country but bordering on the suicidal for them personally.</p>
<p>But, without such a commitment, without such challenging goals, without<br>such accountability, New Zealand will continue to slide down the economic<br>performance rankings.</p>
<p>We can do it. We are a nation of smart people with significant<br>intellectual capital, a tremendous natural environment and a heritage<br>studded with innovation and competitive success.</p>
<p>All we need is leaders with the bottle to set a specific, unambiguous<br>long-term goal and the courage to achieve.</p>
<p>And what example are we currently set?</p>
<p>Taito Philip Field. Need I say more?</p>
<p>A Government in denial until public outrage finally won the day.</p>
<p>Every act geared to self-survival and winning yet another term.</p>
<p>Has the government given any thought to what New Zealand will look like in<br>ten years time? Twenty years? Fifty years?</p>
<p>I have. I want New Zealand to be a country where my children see a<br>future. Like me, I expect they will want to travel, but like me I want<br>them to at least have the choice of coming home permanently because New<br>Zealand is a great place to live and work, a great place to bring up their<br>children. I want New Zealand to be a land of opportunity for them.</p>
<p>Has the Clark regime given any thought to the role of government? No, all<br>they think about is keeping their own jobs after the next election and<br>providing public sector jobs for their cronies.</p>
<p>The Clark regime is utterly focussed on keeping as many people as possible<br>dependent on the state for their income - &#39;Working for Families&#39; is<br>actually &#39;Working to keep Labour in power&#39;.</p>
<p>The Clark regime wants to tell people how to run their lives, raise their<br>families, and run their businesses. There is no better example than the<br>current furore over the anti-smacking bill.</p>
<p>This bill which will not save one child from abuse, one child from<br>suffering like the Kahui twins did. It is a feel good piece of lawmaking<br>intended to salve the consciences of MPs who think they should be doing<br>something to confront domestic violence but don&#39;t know where to start.<br>What it will achieve is turning good and loving parents into lawbreakers<br>when they use a light smack to discipline their children. Another example<br>of a PC government intruding into the lives of families who are doing a<br>good job of raising their children.</p>
<p>ACT believes in putting its trust in the people, in the knowledge they<br>make the best decisions for themselves and their families.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve given plenty of thought to the role of government.</p>
<p>The core role of government is to provide for the safety and security of<br>its citizens. No more, no less.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why ACT believes in less government and total accountability from<br>our elected leaders.</p>
<p>We serve no useful purpose by looking back. We will only prosper if we<br>look to the future and I know ACT has the ideas to take our country<br>forwards.</p>
<p>Labour is stuck in the present. The National Party, engaged in a battle<br>to the death with Labour over the middle ground wants to retreat to the<br>past. ACT - to borrow the words of Bill Clinton - is determined to build<br>a bridge to the future.</p>
<p>Many of ACT&#39;s ideas have now been adopted by all and sundry - time limits<br>on Treaty claims, Zero Tolerance for Crime, Tax Cuts. But as we move<br>further into the 21st century we must look forward and embrace new ideas<br>that make economic sense.</p>
<p>I for one believe that prisoners should only be eligible for parole once<br>they have bettered themselves - studied, sat and passed exams. Fact, our<br>prisons are not full of educated people. They are full of ill-educated,<br>mostly repeat offenders. Educate them and they are less likely to offend.<br>That makes economic sense.</p>
<p>The Clark government has poured an extra $3.5 billion into the health pot<br>with precious little to show for it.</p>
<p>Time for some honesty. Time for some accountability. Time to tell the<br>people the truth. Time to honestly state just what health care people can<br>expect to receive and then be accountable for delivering it.</p>
<p>Yet all we get from Prime Minister Clark is denial. Confronted by<br>evidence that eighty thousand Kiwi kids go to school hungry each day, she<br>went into denial.</p>
<p>Countless thousands of Kiwis are waiting for lifesaving and life changing<br>treatment.</p>
<p>Her solution. Simple. Deny it.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t smack the children but by all means let them starve.</p>
<p>Denial after denial because the solution, the obvious solution, would be<br>the ultimate denial of the crazy ideology that drives this government.</p>
<p>Denial that the answer lays in creating a truly fair society.</p>
<p>A society with an accountable government. A society where people can<br>depend on the government to create an environment in which they can all<br>prosper.</p>
<p>Labour, awash with cash did not return the money to the people and<br>businesses that created it in the first place. No, they didn&#39;t want to<br>see a nation set free from the chains of excessive taxation.</p>
<p>No, rather than setting people free they turned them into beneficiaries.<br>Rather than tax cuts they doled out benefits making more families<br>dependant on government for part of their income.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister knows the answer is to repair the infrastructure, the<br>education system the health service and the people will take care of the<br>rest.</p>
<p>But no, lock as many people as possible into a lifetime of dependence on<br>the state, on the government, on Labour.</p>
<p>We desperately need a government that will put in place the building<br>blocks on which our people can flourish.</p>
<p>A government that encourages success.</p>
<p>A government that recognises its duty is to lead and to inspire.</p>
<p>A government that will not deny them.</p>
<p>A government that will be forever accountable.</p>
<p>A government with ACT at its core.</p>
<p>That&#39;s what we must set out to achieve.</p>
