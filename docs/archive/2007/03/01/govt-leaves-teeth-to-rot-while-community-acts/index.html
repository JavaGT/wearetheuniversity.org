<p>Govt leaves teeth to rot while community acts</p>
<p>The community and private sector have come to the rescue of under-five-year-olds while the Government leaves children’s teeth to rot, says National Party Associate Health spokeswoman Jo Goodhew.</p>
<p>Plunket, Colgate and the New Zealand Dental Association today launched Families Combat Cavities Month - a programme aimed at building good oral health habits from an early age.</p>
<p>“The Government has been so slow to address the soaring rates of tooth decay that these three groups are coming to the rescue with their joint oral health programme,” says Mrs Goodhew.</p>
<p>“The Families Combat Cavities programme is an excellent concept and it&#39;s great to see some action being taken to address the poor oral health of many New Zealand children.</p>
<p>“The initial programme runs for only one month, but I&#39;m heartened to hear that these three groups will continue to work together in the future on a long-term strategy</p>
<p>“But our community should not have to act on behalf of our children.</p>
<p>“In August, Prime Minister Helen Clark called for urgent action on kids’ teeth and promised $100 million for new dental facilities.</p>
<p>“Six months later there has been no sign of action, let alone urgency.</p>
<p>“If the $100 million ever does appear, a major scrap is likely as DHBs fight for their share of the cash.</p>
<p>“Canterbury District Health Board plans to apply for $20 million or 20% of that total despite serving only 11% of the population.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government needs to stop talking and sort this mess out before more children’s teeth rot.”</p>
