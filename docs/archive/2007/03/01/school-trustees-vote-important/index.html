<p>Media Release</p>
<p>01 March 2007</p>
<p>School Trustees Vote Important</p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters is urging parents throughout New Zealand to exercise their vote at the forthcoming School Trustee Elections this month.</p>
<p>Schools around the country are holding campaigns for school trustee elections and nominations for school trustees are being called for today with voting closing on 29 March.</p>
<p>&quot;School trustees play a critically important role in the provision of education services and standards to children. In addition, schools play a significant role in the wider community through such initiatives as adult education and the provision of community facilities.</p>
<p>&quot;Our schools need people on their board who can be active decision-makers in the interests of student achievement and in ensuring that students reach their potential. The decisions they make also need to be reflective of communities&#39; wants, needs and aspirations.</p>
<p>&quot;I encourage parents to vote to ensure that they get the best board for their school,&quot; said Mr Peters.</p>
