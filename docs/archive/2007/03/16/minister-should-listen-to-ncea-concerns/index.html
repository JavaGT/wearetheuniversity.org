<p>Katherine Rich<br>National Party Education Spokeswoman</p>
<p>16 March 2007</p>
<p>Minister should listen to NCEA concerns</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich is concerned about NCEA&#39;s ability to motivate and extend the country&#39;s top academic students.</p>
<p>According to media reports New Zealand&#39;s third largest secondary school, Avondale College, is the latest school to consider introducing the Cambridge exam system.</p>
<p>&quot;The number of schools that have now opted for Cambridge or IB is a clear indication that the current system is not working well enough,&quot; says Mrs Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;When mid-decile schools are saying that they&#39;ve given up waiting for positive change to NCEA and are seriously considering alternatives, the Minister should finally admit that he has a problem on his hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Thinking that this problem will go away isn&#39;t going to work.</p>
<p>&quot;The Labour Government has ignored previous concerns thinking that alternative exams would be only offered by a handful of independent or high-decile schools.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Minister continues to ignore ongoing concerns about NCEA then more schools will opt for alternative exams and the long term health of NCEA will be further undermined.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Rich is meeting with a group of Auckland principals today specifically to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister needs to admit that changes have to be made so the needs of our top students better served.&quot;</p>
