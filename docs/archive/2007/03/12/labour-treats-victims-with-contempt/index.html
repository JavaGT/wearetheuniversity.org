<p>Labour treats victims with contempt</p>
<p>The Labour Government continues to treat the victims of crime with contempt by allowing thousands of people to owe reparations that are many years old, says National’s Justice &amp; Corrections spokesman, Simon Power.</p>
<p>He is releasing figures which show that as at 30 June last year there were 27,039 people owing reparations, 2,325 of whom owed reparations more than 10 years old compared to 2,299 the previous year.</p>
<p>“These figures are a disgrace.</p>
<p>“They show that under this Government, victims of crime are missing out on court-ordered reparation.</p>
<p>“Courts Minister Rick Barker makes all sorts of claims about how his Government is cracking down on unpaid reparations, but that is clearly not happening.</p>
<p>“The fact that there are now more 10-year-old reparations owing than there were a year earlier is testament to that.</p>
<p>“How are victims supposed to get closure and move on with their lives if the issue of reparations ordered by the court have not been addressed?</p>
<p>“By failing to chase these people, Labour is doing victims a grave disservice.</p>
<p>“Rick Barker must take action to see that defaulters are chased up.”</p>
