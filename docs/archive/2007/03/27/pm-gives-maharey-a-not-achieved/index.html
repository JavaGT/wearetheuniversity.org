<p>PM gives Maharey a ‘not achieved’</p>
<p>Prime Minister Helen Clark is clearly not impressed with Education Minister Steve Maharey’s handling of concerns over NCEA, effectively giving him a ‘not achieved’ in this morning’s New Zealand Herald, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister admitted to the media that she was as confused as anyone over the problems with NCEA – confused because she ordered them to be fixed two years ago.</p>
<p>“She said she ordered a full report on NCEA after ‘bizarre behaviour’ at NZQA two years ago and that report recommended changes which included a return to the recording of ‘not achieved’ on a student’s record.</p>
<p>“The fact that she has now waded into the debate over NCEA shows just how little confidence she has in Steve Maharey to deal with the issues at hand.</p>
<p>“The truth is, he has had 14 months to sort out the concerns over NCEA and he hasn’t done it.</p>
<p>“He continues to refer to his work on the 200 recommendations in the State Services Commission report on NCEA, but the problem is the only recommendations he has adopted have been the easy ones.</p>
<p>“In response to Helen Clark’s confusion, Steve Maharey has now assured her through the media that changes to NCEA will be made by the end of the year.</p>
<p>“However, with his track record for fixing problems in education, schools and parents are not holding their breath.”</p>
