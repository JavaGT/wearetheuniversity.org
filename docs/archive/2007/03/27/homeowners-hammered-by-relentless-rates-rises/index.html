<p>John Carter MP<br>National Party Local Government Spokesman</p>

<p>Homeowners hammered by relentless rates rises</p>
<p>&quot;Homeowners who&#39;ve just taken a hit from the Reserve Bank should be prepared for another round of rates rises that far outstrip inflation,&quot; says National Party Local Government spokesman John Carter.</p>
<p>With annual inflation running at around 3%, three councils have unveiled draft rates rises today, 5.5% for the Waikato District Council, an average of 9.9% for the Queenstown District Council, and a proposed 13.4% hike for Northland Regional Council.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of these councils are carrying the cost of central Government buck-passing over the past seven years. The Queenstown District Council goes as far as to say that &#39;additional obligations placed on local authorities by the Government through new Acts of Parliament&#39; are a &#39;key cost&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the past seven years under Labour, rates have risen by a staggering 44.9%. Add the upcoming rates hikes to the rises in mortgage interest rates, and homeowners are increasingly carrying the cost for Labour&#39;s policy settings.</p>
<p>&quot;And what&#39;s worse is that homeowners will have to tighten their belts even further as Labour prepares to spend up large in the lead-up to the next election. That&#39;ll help fuel further mortgage rises and suck more money out of struggling families&#39; pockets.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Carter says Labour&#39;s cavalier approach to legislation which leads to extra costs for ratepayers shows no sign of easing up.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m deeply sceptical about whether the long awaited results from the rates review will spend too much time dwelling on that at all.&quot;</p>
