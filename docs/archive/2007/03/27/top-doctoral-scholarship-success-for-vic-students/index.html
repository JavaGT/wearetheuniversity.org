<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>27 March 2007</p>
<p>Top Doctoral Scholarship success for Victoria students</p>
<p>Victoria University students have been awarded nine Bright Future Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarships worth almost $1 million in the latest round of awards from the Government-funded scheme.</p>
<p>Fifty students nationwide received Bright Future Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarships in the latest round to study either at a New Zealand or overseas university. About $4.7 million was distributed in this round, which is administered by the Tertiary Education Commission.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh, congratulated the students on receiving the prestigious scholarships, which recognise and reward New Zealand’s best postgraduate students.</p>
<p>“To receive nine scholarships in the first round of the year alone, when we received eight in total for last year, is a significant achievement in itself and not only reflects Victoria’s standing as one of New Zealand’s leading research universities but also the efforts of the Scholarships team in the Office of Research &amp; Postgraduate Studies. Substantially increasing the proportion of postgraduate students in the next decade is a key strategic objective for the University and so continued success on this scale will aid our efforts in achieving this goal.”</p>
<p>Six students received Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarships to study at Victoria University worth more than $590,000 in total. They were:</p>
<p>- Bradley Anderson, a student in the School of Chemical &amp; Physical Sciences, will investigate C-H Bond Activation by Transition Metal Polyhydride Complexes;</p>

<p>- Gareth Prosser, a student in the School of Biological Sciences, will investigate the characterisation and optimization of novel bacterial enzymes that activate chemotherapeutic pro-drugs;</p>
<p>- Robyn Langlands, a student in the School of Psychology, will undertake research on the situational, cognitive and emotional factors that precipitate deliberate self-harm behaviours in adolescents and young adults;</p>
<p>- Lauren Christie, a student in the School of Architecture, will investigate how to communicate sustainability and create a culture for sustainable homes in New Zealand through understanding behaviours and motivations; and</p>
<p>- Susan Liebich, a student in the School of History, Philosophy, Political Science &amp; International Relations, will undertake research on the book Markets and reading culture in the British World and New Zealand from1890 to the 1950s.</p>
<p>As well, three Victoria students received scholarships worth more than $380,000 in total to study at overseas universities. They were:</p>
<p>- Terence Green, who holds an MA from Victoria, who will undertake research at Columbia University in the United States on the politics of evolution and how evolutionary theory changed political theory in Britain 1850-1914;</p>
<p>- John Dennison, who holds a BA(Hons) from Victoria in English, will undertake research at St Andrew’s University in Scotland on poetic redress and negotiations of political conflict in the poetry of Seamus Heaney; and</p>
