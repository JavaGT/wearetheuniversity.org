<p>Contract aims to improve disaster awareness</p>
<p>The Joint Centre for Disaster Research has been awarded a $27,000 contract from the Earthquake Commission to investigate effective community-based public education initiatives.</p>
<p>Associate Professor David Johnston says there is limited research in New Zealand on disaster preparedness. This study will identify the best options for improving the design, implementation, delivery and monitoring of community-based programmes.</p>
<p>“Research consistently shows that traditional public education programmes, based on presenting hazard information, have failed to improve household disaster preparedness. New strategies are needed to encourage and sustain awareness of hazards and how to mitigate them,” he says.</p>
<p>The contract will allow for the appointment of Dr Kirsten Finnis, a recent PhD graduate in emergency management.</p>
<p>The Centre for Disaster Research was opened in 2006 by the University and GNS Science to better prepare New Zealand against natural disasters. The centre is based at the School of Psychology at the Wellington campus.</p>
<p>Key initial areas for research include emergency management planning, community resilience and welfare issues, and the role of public education and warnings in disaster preparedness, response and recovery.</p>
