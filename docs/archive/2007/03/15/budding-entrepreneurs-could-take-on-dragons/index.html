<p><strong>Thursday, 15 March 2007, 2:57 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology">Auckland University of Technology</a></strong></p>
<p>Budding entrepreneurs could take on Dragons</p>
<p>The crew of Dragons&#39; Den may need to prepare themselves for an onslaught of new business entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>More than 1200 students from 44 Auckland high schools have signed up for the 2007 regional Young Enterprise Scheme (YES). These budding entrepreneurs have dreams of being the next wave of successful Kiwi business owners.</p>
<p>Enterprise New Zealand Trust created the nationwide YES programme to promote a student enterprise culture. Students learn to create a start-up business and implement financial management, marketing and sales, communications, human resources, production and leadership, and close the business at the end of the year.</p>
<p>YES could also stand for youthful, enterprising and savvy, says AUT relationship manager Victoria Cockerton, who helped run the Auckland regional Enterprise Days (E Days) held at AUT&#39;s city campus in February and March.</p>
<p>E Days are intensive one-day introductions for students to develop their ideas into profitable businesses. Victoria says this year&#39;s YES has attracted a substantial number of promising entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>&quot;Numbers have climbed beyond our expectations since the programme&#39;s introduction in 1989,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a sure sign of the street-smart, business-minded youth our Kiwi society is rearing. Even Donald Trump would be impressed.&quot;</p>
<p>AUT University is the nationwide academic sponsor. Its Business School sets and marks the YES exam held in September and awards a one-year scholarship to the student who demonstrates outstanding academic performance in the exam.</p>

<p>Victoria says ongoing commitment from high school staff, business coaches and mentors who volunteer their time and support from sponsors has meant the scheme is more popular than ever.</p>
<p>&quot;YES is an intensive and rewarding programme,&quot; she says. &quot;Students invest real money, produce real products, pay real taxes – and get to keep the real profits. And if every one of them learns the lessons of starting up and running a business – and turning a profit – then New Zealand&#39;s future is bright.&quot;</p>
<p>Dragons, beware.</p>
