Lincoln University´s Chancellor, Tom Lambie, a former President of Federated Farmers, made the presentation.</p>
<p>In addition to farmers, visitors to the dairying unit over the years have included a prime minister (Vietnam), diplomats (eg. US Ambassador and British High Commissioner), NZ Government Ministers (eg. Hon. Jim Anderton), overseas Members of Parliament (eg. Australia, Italy), overseas government officials from numerous countries, environmentalists, scientists and student groups.</p>
