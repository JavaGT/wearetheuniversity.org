<p>Truancy prosecution rates pathetic</p>
<p>Revelations that just 17 parents and guardians have been prosecuted in the past three years for letting their children truant highlight a weak education system that is failing our most at-risk school students, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>“This is a tiny number of prosecutions in the face of a tidal wave of truancy,” says Mrs Rich.</p>
<p>The Ministry’s own survey last year found 45,000 secondary school students playing truant in one given week – that is 20% of all secondary students in New Zealand. The survey found truancy had increased 16% in the past two years.</p>
<p>“The figures broken down by ethnicity are also disturbing,” says Mrs Rich.</p>
<p>“The 2006 New Zealand Schools Attendance, Absence and Truancy report also shows 7.1% of Maori females and 6.6% of Maori males were last year absent without justification.</p>
<p>“This is an alarming rise and the figures are a disgrace. Truancy is quickly becoming Labour’s education legacy.</p>
<p>“The number of prosecutions is pathetic compared to the high rate of truancy.</p>
<p>“Prosecutions and fines are a clear way to send a message within the present laws. We need to support truancy officers. They need more tools in their toolbox and a Government that will back them.</p>
<p>“Labour has largely turned a blind eye to this rising problem. It&#39;s only answer was to restructure the service which caused disarray and distraction from the core task of getting truants back in the classroom.</p>
<p>“It&#39;s this basic - kids won&#39;t learn if they aren&#39;t there.</p>
<p>“Getting those kids back into a learning environment should be a national priority.”</p>
