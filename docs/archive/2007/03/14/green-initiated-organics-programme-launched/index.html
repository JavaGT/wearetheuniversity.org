<p>14 March 2007</p>
<p>Green-initiated organics programme launched</p>
<p>The Green Party is today welcoming the launch of one of its key post-election negotiated programmes - the Organic Advisory Service.</p>
<p>The $2.2 million three-year programme will be officially launched at Lincoln University at 6.30pm.</p>
<p>Green Party Organics Spokesperson Sue Kedgley says she is pleased to see her initiative get off the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;It is great to see the Government get behind this sector and help it to expand and grow</p>
<p>&quot;If the Government is committed to making New Zealand sustainable, then it must support the organics sector and increase the tiny percentage (0.24%) of agricultural land that is in organic production.</p>
<p>&quot;This initiative is aimed at encouraging several hundred farmers to convert to organics every year by providing them with advice and assistance.</p>
<p>&quot;I am confident that, in the years to come, we will see a burgeoning of organic production as producers become better informed about organics and have more examples and assistance to help them solve problems,&quot; Ms Kedgley says.</p>
<p>&quot;Where would New Zealand&#39;s traditional agriculture be today if it had not received this kind of support in its early years? This is about helping to develop a sustainable and flourishing organic sector in New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>The programme is administered by Organic Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
