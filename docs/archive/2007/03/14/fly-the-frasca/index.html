<p>It’s the most flying you can do without leaving the ground.</p>
<p>A new state-of-the-art flight simulator just acquired by the Massey University School of Aviation sets new standards in realism.</p>
<p>The United States-built Frasca Truflite light aircraft simulator has the capability to create a wide range of flying conditions. The school’s general manager Captain Ashok Poduval describes it as “an excellent training device that can simulate realistic scenarios, such as rain and thunder and lightening (including sound), fog, and day and night visual conditions, as well as various flight emergencies.”</p>
<p>The Frasca takes the form of a cockpit module, equipped with aircraft kits that simulate the Piper Seneca V and the Piper Warrior. The main instrument panel features two large LCD flat screens, which display the aircraft instruments.</p>
<p>The new simulator will be used to train Bachelor of Aviation students as well as flight instructors. The school already has other light aircraft simulators but Captain Poduval says the Frasca is “a giant step” in enhancing the school’s ability to produce excellent learning outcomes.</p>
<p>Education Minister Steven Maharey has accepted an invitation to “fly” the Frasca at an opening ceremony at the School of Aviation’s Flight Centre in Palmerston North this Friday 16 March.</p>
<p>Captain Poduval is also inviting media representatives to take a flight. But he warns that the Frasca achieves a very high degree of realism and journalists should be sure they have the stomach for it.</p>
<p>When: 0900 Friday 16 March.<br>Where: Flight Centre, School of Aviation, Milson, Palmerston North</p>
