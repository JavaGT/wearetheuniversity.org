<p>Hon Tony Ryall<br>National Party Health Spokesman</p>

<p>Real action needed on health workforce shortage</p>
<p>Labour needs to get its act together and do something tangible to address the ongoing shortage of healthcare workers in New Zealand, says National’s Health spokesman Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>“Even the United Nations has recognised the importance of the issue with today&#39;s announcement of an international approach.</p>
<p>“New Zealand faces a grim future of even more harshly rationed healthcare if we don’t have the staff our hospitals need or GPs leading family health teams.</p>
<p>“This is an ongoing and urgent issue, and yet all the Health Minister is doing is calling for more committees and reports.</p>
<p>“What is needed is real action. Mr Hodgson has another taskforce working on the issue presently.</p>
<p>“National would invest in a significant expansion in medical student places, particularly GP training places. We would have more training in rural and provincial areas, which research shows makes it more likely that medical professionals will stay and work in these areas.</p>
<p>“We would investigate ways in which nursing graduates could gain much-needed work experience. And a National-led Government would cut personal taxes, making it more rewarding to stay in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“More importantly, National would encourage greater respect and co-operation with our health professionals, rather than Pete Hodgson’s high-handed Wellington-knows-best values.”</p>
