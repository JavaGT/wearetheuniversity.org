<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>21 March 2007</p>
<p>Future bright for Māori graduates</p>
<p>Four Victoria PhD graduates have been recognised in the National Māori Academic Excellence Awards, or Te Amorangi, held on 2 March at Turangawaewae Marae, near Ngaruawahia.</p>
<p>The awardees are: Dr Adele Whyte (Ngāti Kahungunu, Te Whakatohea); Dr Danna Challies (Ngāti Whatua, Tainui); Dr Wally Penetito (Ngāti Haua, Ngāti Tamatera, Ngāti Raukawa); and in absentia, Dr Wharehuia Hemara (Tuhoe). Dr Whyte and Dr Challies are both mentors for Te Ropu Āwhina Putaiao, Victoria’s mentoring scheme for Māori and Pacific students enrolled in science courses.</p>
<p>Dr Whyte says Āwhina has shown her the importance of role models and support for Māori academic achievement.</p>
<p>“In my years as a mentor in the School of Biological Sciences I’ve seen a large growth in the number of Māori students doing Honours, Master’s and particularly PhD-level research in our department. I’m really excited to have been part of this growth and I know that in the future Victoria is going to have a strong presence at these awards.”</p>
<p>The awards were inaugurated five years ago to celebrate excellence in the candidate’s field of study. However, in 2003 the criteria were amended and the award is now presented to all Māori PhD graduates annually.</p>
<p>Professor Piri Sciascia, Victoria’s Pro Vice-Chancellor (Māori), says it was wonderful to see these Victoria graduates’ success being recognised.</p>
<p>“It takes a special person to combine a commitment to fostering education in the Maori and Pacific Communities with completing a PhD, and it is those qualities that were recognised in the National Māori Academic Excellence Award.”</p>

<p>In 2006, 1,744 Māori and 871 Pacific Island students were enrolled at Victoria in all six faculties.</p>
<p>The School of Biological Sciences, for example, has seven young Māori and Pacific scientists undertaking research degrees, and more than 100 Māori and Pacific Island undergraduates studying Biology.</p>
<p>“These students demonstrate that the future for young Māori students is bright,” says Professor Sciascia. “The University is very privileged to be able to help them prepare for that future.”</p>
