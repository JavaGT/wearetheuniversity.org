<p>Te Reo curriculum won’t solve the big Maori education issues</p>
<p>The release of the Government’s draft Te Reo Maori curriculum is a positive step, but it will not address the most pressing issues facing Maori education, says National’s Maori Affairs Education spokesman, Tau Henare.</p>
<p>The Government today released the draft Te Reo Mâori curriculum guidelines for public consultation.</p>
<p>“I agree that second language learning, including learning Te Reo Maori, has significant academic, cognitive and cultural benefits and is important for New Zealand’s cultural advancement and cohesion,” says Mr Henare.</p>
<p>“But this shouldn’t be at the expense of the Kura kaupapa that we have.</p>
<p>“I am always sceptical about what difference documents like this actually make at the chalkface.</p>
<p>“There are always issues with the translation of curriculum levels and I’m not convinced this draft document will be any different.</p>
<p>“No matter how many new strategies Labour develops for Maori education, it doesn’t make any difference.</p>
<p>“This document won’t make any difference to the number of teachers able to front a class and teach Te Reo, or the number of Maori children who are disengaged from education.</p>
<p>“Issues like high rates of truancy and poor rates of literacy are the biggest education problems facing young Maori right now, and a new curriculum document will not address those.</p>
<p>“The Government needs to look wider than this curriculum document if it wants to provide all the answers to Maori education problems.</p>
<p>“It would have made sense to fund the Maori dictionary project being run by the Maori Language Commission, that way all schools would have had a resource they could use.”</p>
