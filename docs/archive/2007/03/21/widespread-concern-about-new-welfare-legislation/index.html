<p>Widespread concern about new welfare legislation</p>
<p>As select committee hearings conclude today on the new Social Security Amendment Bill, a rising level of concern is being expressed by beneficiary advocacy groups, disabled persons and church and community organizations about the likely impact of the Bill, Green Party Social Development Spokesperson Sue Bradford says.</p>
<p>Ms Bradford outlined the Greens opposition to the Bill in a speech delivered at the &#39;Where to For Welfare&#39; conference held today at Auckland University.</p>
<p>&#39;Increasingly, Labour and National are taking virtually identical positions on welfare. To their mutual shame, they are both pushing for greater work-testing for invalids, sickness and solo parent beneficiaries, and both seem willfully blind to the fact that benefit levels are too low for either individuals or families to live on.</p>
<p>&quot;Around the country, beneficiaries are suffering from income inadequacy, debt and social exclusion and their children will suffer lifelong consequences from a childhood spent in poverty. These pressures are compounded by a welfare delivery system that varies in quality from region to region, and that too often fails to give people their full entitlements.</p>
<p>&quot;If this Bill passes in its current form, people with mental, physical and intellectual impairments will come under increasing pressure to meet work test requirements, creating increased stress and sadness for many,&quot; Ms Bradford says.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greens were the only party in Parliament to oppose this Bill. We are pressing the case for genuine reform - which would start with scrapping the Social Security Act 1964 and its many amendments. We need to start again, and devise new welfare legislation based on three key principles - simplicity, sufficiency and universality. Such an approach would remove the structural discrimination against beneficiaries that is central to the Working for Families package.</p>

<p>&quot;The punitive approach to welfare taken by Labour and National is mere politicking, at the expense of the vulnerable. We need to develop a fresh approach to welfare based on respect for those in hard times, and for the good job of parenting that the vast majority are doing in the most difficult of circumstances. We should also respect and honour people with disabilities, and not treat them harshly,&quot; Ms Bradford says.</p>
