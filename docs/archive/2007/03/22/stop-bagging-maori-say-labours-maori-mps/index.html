<p><strong>Thursday, 22 March 2007, 4:32 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>22 March 2006 News Release</p>
<p>Stop bagging Maori say Labour’s Maori MPs</p>
<p>Te Roopu Reipa Maori Caucus is disappointed the Maori Party continues to bag Maori educational performance, saying it is sending the wrong messages to our rangatahi.</p>
<p>“Once again it appears the right hand of the Maori Party doesn&#39;t know what the left hand is doing,” says Labour Maori MP and Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia.</p>
<p>&quot;Last week Hone Harawira told the Maori Affairs select committee he was sick and tired of people ‘talking from a deficit model’&#39; about Maori achievement in education,&#39;&#39; says committee member Mahara Okeroa.</p>
<p>“The doom and gloom pictures of Maori educational achievement painted by Pita Sharples and Te Ururoa Flavell today contradict that and give little encouragement to our tamariki and rangatahi,” says Maori caucus chairman Shane Jones.</p>
<p>&quot;Hone told the select committee that: &quot;if anybody came to my kura and talked like that, I&#39;d drop them,&#39;&#39; Mr Okeroa says.</p>
<p>Labour’s Maori MPs noted this was the same week the Maori Party wanted to show leadership on combating domestic violence, so Hone’s solution to the ‘deficit’ problem was unfortunate.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#39;t be surprised if Tariana has to muzzle him once again, to make him get&#39;n behind,&#39;&#39; the Labour MPs said.</p>
<p>“But we agree with Hone that Maori are fed up with the negative focus. We need to celebrate the positive achievements Maori are making in education and ensure we build on those success stories.</p>
<p>“The latest Census data about Maori, released yesterday, contained a lot of positive news including increases in Maori employment and income levels,&quot; Shane Jones said.</p>

<p>Labour list MP Dover Samuels says the statistics show Maori progress across the board is &quot;unprecedented&#39;&#39;, demonstrating the government&#39;s policies are working on the ground.</p>
<p>He congratulated those Maori organisations that are working to improve outcomes for Maori.</p>
<p>Parekura Horomia, also Associate Education Minister, said the Census shows a huge increase in the number of Maori with bachelor degrees or higher qualifications and a decrease in the percentage of Maori leaving school without qualifications.</p>
<p>&quot;However the figures, also show, as we&#39;ve been saying, that there is more work to be done and we&#39;re committed to continuing to make that progress.</p>
<p>“That&#39;s why the government launched the Te Mana programme last week, which aims to provide students with positive Maori role models to encourage their education achievement.</p>
<p>&quot;I launched the draft document for Te Reo Maori in the New Zealand Curriculum yesterday, which will give further support for children learning Te Reo. There are a number of other programmes underway,&#39;&#39; the Minister says.</p>
<p>Education Ministry officials told the Maori Affairs select committee that there were real success stories for Maori – particularly in some Maori immersion schools – and the challenge was to continue to identify what worked and to encourage other schools to follow the lead.</p>
<p>Mr Jones urged whanau to have a key role in improving the educational opportunities and outcomes for their tamariki. &quot;Come on Maori, we&#39;re on the move, let&#39;s crank it up!&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>KEY FACTS ON MÄORI EDUCATION</p>
