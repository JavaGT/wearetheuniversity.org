<p>Education officials must act on concerns over technology curriculum</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education needs to start taking seriously the wave of concerns over the draft technology curriculum, says National&#39;s Associate Education spokesman, Colin King.</p>
<p>At yesterday&#39;s Education and Science Select Committee meeting, the Ministry was invited to respond to the PPTA&#39;s concerns over technology teaching in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry officials were hopelessly ill-prepared and could not answer basic questions over the draft technology curriculum.</p>
<p>&quot;None of the officials had read the Massey University research report into New Zealand&#39;s technology curriculum - &quot;Technological Literacy in New Zealand: Two paradigms a swing<br>apart&quot; - so they were unable to provide their thoughts on that study and the included survey&#39;s findings relating to teacher satisfaction with the curriculum.</p>
<p>&quot;Business New Zealand and the PPTA have both fronted at the Select Committee and voiced their concerns over the crisis in the technology curriculum.</p>
<p>&quot;They said that schools were struggling to attract qualified and trained technology teachers, leaving in limbo students who want to progress on to further trade training.</p>
<p>&quot;They also stressed there was no clear, shared vision on the delivery of technology education in schools.</p>
<p>&quot;When the Ministry had their chance to respond to these concerns, all they could come up with were glib responses and flippant remarks.</p>
<p>&quot;Technology education in schools has been ignored for too long and it is high time the Ministry woke up and addressed what are now major problems.&quot;</p>
