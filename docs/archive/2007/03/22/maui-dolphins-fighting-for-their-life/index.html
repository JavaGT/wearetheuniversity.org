<p>Maui Dolphins Fighting for their Life</p>
<p>says Turia Tariana Turia,<br>Fisheries Spokesperson, Maori Party</p>
<p>Thursday 22 March 2007</p>
<p>Tariana Turia today reacted to calls she has received following her speech in the House condemning the threat of sand-mining upon the marine environment.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders are telling me that they are concerned that the activities of mining companies are placing the life of the critically endangered Maui dolphin at risk&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;Maui&#39;s dolphins are on the edge of extinction, with last estimates being only 110 individual Maui dolphins left in the wild&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>The World Conservation Union has classified these small dolphins as &#39;critically endangered&#39;.</p>
<p>These extremely rare dolphins are only found on the west coast of Aotearoa; and can be seen in water less than twenty metres deep. Preliminary results from an Otago University study for the World Wide Fund for Nature had indicated the dolphins were present in harbours where set netting was still permitted.</p>
<p>&quot;The research released just two weeks ago, issued a stern warning about the urgent need to pull out all the stops to protect Maui dolphins from further harm&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>The study produced the first sound recordings of Maui dolphins by using acoustic tracking devices which tracked them in harbours on the West Coast.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the summer, tangata whenua, conservation groups, environmentalists and local New Zealanders were distressed to discover the death of four Maui Dolphins washed up on the shore&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Time is of the essence&quot; said Mrs Turia. &quot;The damage and exploitation of the seabed mining being sanctioned by Crown Minerals is creating an unacceptably high risk for these iconic New Zealand dolphins&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not want to be the first developed country in the world to wipe out a species of marine dolphins&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;We are the first to speak out about the preservation of whales offshore and are critical of other nations that are not meeting standards - and yet here we are, not following those same principles ourselves - in terms of these unique and endangered creatures&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Our strategy needs to be widespread and visionary - addressing the threats to the species habitats - tourism, set nets; boat strikes, pollution; and the exploitation of the seabed for iron sand&quot;.</p>
<p>Background Seabed mining involves suctioning up vast quantities of sand from the ocean floor, and then dumping the mineral-stripped remains. This disrupts the natural balance of the seabed, leading to the degeneration of sea life - affecting local fishery, wave patterns and the general ocean environment.</p>
<p>Mrs Turia spoke about seabed mining in the General Debate of 21 March. Please contact me if you would like to receive a copy of the speech.</p>
