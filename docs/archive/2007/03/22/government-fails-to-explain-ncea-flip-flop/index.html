<p>Katherine Rich MP National Party Education Spokeswoman</p>

<p>Government fails to explain NCEA flip-flop</p>
<p>The Government has failed to explain why Education Minister Steve Maharey now looks keen on reporting failure on a student&#39;s NCEA record of learning when only a few months ago he was vehemently opposed to the concept, says National&#39;s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;We can only assume that Minister Maharey has had a Road to Damascus experience leading him to &#39;leaning toward&#39; reporting &#39;not achieved&#39; on a record of learning.</p>
<p>&quot;It was only last September when he dismissed the idea out of hand, saying &#39;there is no place on such a list for the things that people have not yet attained or perhaps not even attempted&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Funnily enough this is not the top issue on the minds of those who have genuine concerns about NCEA not serving the needs of top students.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister is clearly trying to look as if he is doing something about NCEA, but it&#39;s nothing more than a cynical attempt to head-off major change.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a tactical attempt to make a low-cost concession while ignoring all the major issues about NCEA&#39;s design.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s like trying to look sincere about fixing your neighbour&#39;s car by twiddling with the car radio when the real problems are with the engine.&quot;</p>
