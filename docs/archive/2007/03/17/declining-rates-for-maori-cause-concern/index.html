<p>&#39;Declining participation rates for Maori cause concern&#39;</p>
<p>Dr Pita Sharples, Co-leader, Maori Party</p>
<p>Friday 16 March 2007</p>
<p>“The reverse fortunes of Maori and non-Maori participating in tertiary education should cause alarm for all New Zealanders” said Dr Pita Sharples, tertiary education spokesperson for the Maori Party today.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education released facts this week which reported that Maori participation in tertiary education had declined from 22.7% of the adult Maori population in 2004 to 22.1% in 2005; while participation rate for students of all ethnicities increased from 13.7% to 14.2%.</p>
<p>“It’s not only the participation rates that’s our concern” said Dr Sharples. “It’s also at what level Maori students are participating - and the facts show they’re all concentrated in the lower levels (sub-degree qualifications) rather than at bachelor and post-graduate levels”.</p>
<p>“Until the government addresses the abysmal failure of secondary schools to adequately prepare decent numbers of Maori students who are &#39;tertiary-study&#39; ready, in terms of both academic achievement and learning confidence, Maori participation in tertiary education will continue to be heavily skewed towards certificate level study” said Dr Sharples, a formerProfessor of Education at the Auckland University.</p>
<p>“The problem with the current participation picture is that gaining certificates and diplomas do not result in equitable incomes between Maori and non-Maori, where gaining a degree qualification does” explained Dr Sharples.</p>

<p>Ministry of Education data shows that for Maori, getting a tertiary qualification does not improve employment chances.</p>
<p>“Maori students are paid less when moving into the workforce, and this is both when completing and not completing qualifications” stated Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>“The only time we earn at the same level as non-Maori is when we’ve completed a degree. But for those completing certificates and diplomas, however, the pay gap is significant”.</p>
<p>“The data released this week, was inevitable, as a result of the Government’s brutal decision to cut Maori student support funding, particularly the Manaaki Tauira grants, and the SSG” said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>“It just beggars belief that the Minister of Maori Affairs can issue a press release saying “Maori succeeding in tertiary education” when his own Ministry shows the number of Maori equivalent full students has decreased by 3.4% (1,860)” said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>“One has to wonder – what IS success in the eyes of the Minister? Extending the queues to the local WINZ office? “ ended Dr Sharples.</p>
