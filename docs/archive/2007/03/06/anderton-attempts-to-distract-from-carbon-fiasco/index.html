<p>Hon Nick Smith MP<br>National Party Climate Change Spokesman</p>
<p>6 March 2007</p>
<p>Anderton attempts to distract from carbon fiasco</p>
<p>Jim Anderton&#39;s hysterical response to National over carbon credits isn&#39;t surprising from someone seeking to distract attention from Labour&#39;s carbon credits fiasco, says National Party Climate Change spokesman Nick Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;My response to media questioning that National would engage with the forestry sector and that some credits will be given to post-1990 forests is a mature reaction to a real problem,&quot; says Dr Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Anderton, on the other hand, screams from the hilltops about National in the hope that the public is distracted from Labour&#39;s carbon credit fiasco that has led to deforestation at a record rate.</p>
<p>&quot;National believes that forestry plantings are one of the main ways we can deal with our emissions. Disincentivising forest owners by slapping a deforestration tax on and inviting a chainsaw massacre is absurd.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not prepared to sit by and see tens of thousands of hectares of forest chopped down because the Government has daft disincentives in place.</p>
<p>&quot;The disaster of the deforestation tax is that many landowners are starting up their chainsaws early, making for reports of a massacre of New Zealand forests in areas like the central North Island and Canterbury.</p>
<p>&quot;Forestry and foresters are part of the solution to climate change, not part of the problem, and they should be treated as such.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Anderton, on the other hand, is talking about Government policy proposals that are leading to thousands of additional tonnes of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere with no offset. That&#39;s not good enough.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government is part of the problem, not the solution.&quot;</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
