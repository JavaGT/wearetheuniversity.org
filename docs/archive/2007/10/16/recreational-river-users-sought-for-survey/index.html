<p>Recreational river users sought for survey</p>
<p>All of New Zealand’s recreational river users are being called on to take part in a major survey exploring river use and motivation for participation. The survey’s findings are expected to aid future policymaking and planning decisions.</p>
<p>The University of Otago researchers hope to provide the first comprehensive evidence-based model of the needs and values of all the country’s river user groups, including kayakers, anglers and multi-sporters.</p>
<p>The internet survey will be launched on November 1.The research team will also travel to selected river recreation events over the next few months to encourage people to take part.</p>
<p>School of Physical Education Lecturer Dr Shayne Galloway says the survey will give people who recreate on rivers the opportunity to clearly set out how and why they use and value them.</p>
<p>“There is a significant gap in knowledge regarding recreational users and their needs as compared to industry use and needs,” Dr Galloway says.</p>
<p>“If we can gather good empirical evidence from all the river user groups in the country, we can provide relevant policy makers with an accurate picture of how important recreational users hold their rivers to be.”</p>
<p>The analysis should also allow a comprehensive understanding of the motivations and barriers to participation among different groups of users, he says. This would include Maori taking part in traditional activities such as mahinga kai and waka ama and contemporary recreational river uses.</p>
<p>The survey will ask participants a range of questions about their past use of rivers and their motivations for participation. In addition, the respondents will be asked to make decisions about participation under particular scenarios.</p>
<p>“From the survey we can develop an in-depth model of why rivers in New Zealand are valued for particular recreational uses and to what degree,” he says.</p>
<p>“Carefully balancing the needs of recreational and industrial uses of rivers is becoming increasingly difficult. We hope that this study can have a significant impact by providing robust data, but that will depend on participation from the public.”</p>
<p>The more people from different activities who participate in the survey, the more robust its findings will be, he says.</p>
<p>The researchers are encouraging as many river users as possible to take the time to fill it out. The survey is located at <a href="http://www.riversurvey.otago.ac.nz">www.riversurvey.otago.ac.nz</a>. Those interested may pre-register for the survey before 1 November.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Recreational River Use Study: Specialisation, Motivation and Decision-making is funded by a SPARC Research Grant, the New Zealand Water Safety Council, and the University of Otago School of Physical Education.</p>
