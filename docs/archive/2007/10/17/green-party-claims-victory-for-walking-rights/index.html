<p>17 October 2007<br>Green Party claims victory for walking rights</p>
<p>The Green Party&#39;s call to have a fairer balance of interests on the Walking Access Advisory Panel has been heeded by the Rural Affairs Minister Damian O&#39;Conner.</p>
<p>The original panel included three farming representatives but only one with a recreational perspective; the new make-up is more balanced with two recreationalists and two farmers.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the importance of the panel&#39;s role in establishing enduring rights for all New Zealanders - people who use the land for recreation and those who make a living from it - it is imperative that all interests are fairly and properly represented,&quot; Green Party Conservation Spokesperson Metiria Turei says.</p>
<p>In 2004, the Green Party urged the Government to find a process for negotiation and conflict resolution between landowners afraid of crime and interference with stock, and people wanting to enjoy traditional access to the great outdoors. The Government has gone part of the way there in accepting the panel&#39;s report on outdoor walking access and now appointing a permanent advisory board.</p>
<p>The Green Party still urges the Government to consider giving the board or the proposed access organisation enough teeth to require the very small minority of landowners who are unreasonably obstructive of access in the public interest, and who refuse to engage in the process to find a solution.</p>
<p>Mrs Turei says: &quot;I am saddened by the loss of Bryce Johnson&#39;s forthright advocacy for public access and recreation from the panel - and hope this is not punishment for his minority report. However, the Green Party also welcomes Brian Stephenson from the Federated Mountain Clubs. The FMC have been strong advocates for public access to conservation lands. We hope that Brian will remain a strong advocate for public access.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that academic Dr Jenny Ross will be a strong advocate for recreation. Her expertise in health and physical activity should provide a good background to the importance of outdoor recreation to New Zealand. Ease of access to physical exercise in our special places has benefit to health and appreciation of our environment.&quot;</p>
