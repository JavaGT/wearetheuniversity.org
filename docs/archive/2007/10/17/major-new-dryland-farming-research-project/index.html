<p><strong>Wednesday, 17 October 2007, 1:52 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>Lincoln University launches major new dryland farming research project</p>
<p>Lincoln University research that will &quot;push the boundaries&quot; of productivity<br>and profitability in dryland farming will be launched with a public field day at<br>Silverwood Farm, Hororata, on Wednesday 24 October.</p>
<p>The research, funded by the MAF´s Sustainable Farming Fund with support<br>from Ravensdown Ltd and Agriseeds Ltd, is responding to a recent survey in<br>which sheep farmers identified improvement in flock productivity and<br>profitability as their greatest need.</p>
<p>Lincoln University agricultural scientists and farm management experts<br>believe it is possible to increase flock productivity on dryland sheep farms<br>through a combination of -<br>o More efficient ewes, producing more kilograms per weaned lamb<br>against kilograms of mated ewe;<br>o Increased animal and flock performance through improved pasture<br>quality and feeding value;<br>o Greater flexibility in farm policies to deal with climate variability.</p>
<p>Two trial units of 87 and 85 hectares, each of 16 paddocks, have been<br>established at Silverwood and stocked with small framed, high fecundity<br>ewes at high stocking rates. One unit is based on high intake/high quality<br>pasture species including lucerne, perennial clovers oversown with annual<br>grasses - the `switch system - winter forage and permanent pastures; the<br>other unit is based on intensively managed perennial grass:clover pasture<br>with one paddock of winter forage and one paddock of lucerne.</p>

<p>Silverwood is a 418-hectare light land farm at Hororata. It is operated under<br>a charitable trust and has been leased by Lincoln University since 1999.</p>
<p>Lincoln University established a farmer reference group to help define<br>research priorities for the farm and the dryland sheep system project is the<br>first big enterprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Farmers in the Silverwood reference group made it clear they wanted to<br>see research that would `push the boundaries´ of productivity and profitability<br>in dryland farming,&quot; says the project leader Professor Tony Bywater.</p>
<p>&quot;In discussion with Lincoln University staff the farmers identified ewe<br>efficiency (that is, kilogram per lamb weaned against kilogram per ewe<br>mated); management of high fecundity ewes; maximising lamb numbers;<br>alternative lambing times; and feeder lambs versus finishing lambs, as high<br>priorities for investigation on the animal side.</p>
<p>&quot;On the pasture side, areas regarded as important for research were feed<br>quality and pasture mixes to achieve high performance levels; annual<br>grasses plus nitrogen versus annual legumes versus perennial clovers;<br>winter feeding options; and maintaining high clover pastures.</p>
<p>&quot;Other issues the reference group was keen to see investigated included<br>risk management options with respect to climate and markets; integration<br>with irrigated farms; ICT applications in monitoring and decision-making<br>support; and independent comparisons of competing husbandries and<br>technologies.</p>
<p>&quot;Above all, farmers wanted detailed monitoring to provide a strong<br>benchmark on productivity and profit.&quot;</p>
<p>There are around 3560 dryland farms on the east coast of New Zealand,<br>covering some 1.64 million hectares and carrying 12.2 million stock units.</p>
<p>&quot;The main constraint to increased productivity on these farms is the risk<br>inherent in the highly variable growing environment of a dryland farm,&quot; says<br>Professor Bywater.</p>
<p>&quot;Most farmers adopt a conservative policy, keeping costs down and<br>maintaining a relatively low stocking rate to reduce the risk of running out of<br>feed.</p>
<p>&quot;In the Silverwood trials we will be looking at greater flexibility in farm<br>policies to deal with climate variability. We will stock for better than average<br>seasons and build in as many flexibilities as possible to reduce feed demand<br>when pasture production is less than expected.&quot;</p>
<p>The field day at Silverwood Farm on Wednesday 24 October starts at<br>1.30pm. Silverwood is on Leeches Road, 5.75 km west of the Selwyn<br>sawmill on the road from Hororata to Windwhistle. All interested farmers,<br>industry representatives and members of the public are welcome. No prior<br>registration is necessary.</p>
