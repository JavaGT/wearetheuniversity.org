<p>Labour lets police recruitment standards slip</p>
<p>The Government has allowed physical and mental entry standards for police recruits to slip just so it can keep NZ First happy, says National&#39;s Police spokesman, Chester Borrows.</p>
<p>&quot;The report on Police Standards and Assessment Practice confirms there are now lower minimum entry criteria on two important physical recruitment standards, and in reasoning and mental ability tests.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year they increased the times that recruits have to complete the 2.4km run, to take account of age and gender, and lowered the wall-climb test from 1.8 metres (6ft) to 1.2 metres (4ft).</p>
<p>&quot;The report says these changes &#39;did not follow a sound and rigorous process to ensure the changes were defensible&#39;, and &#39;lacked a sound rationale or research evidence on which to base the changes&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;In other words, there was no sound reason to change them, other than to allow more people to pass the entry test - they lowered the bar.</p>
<p>&quot;And they did that because they were having trouble reaching their target of 1,000 police, which was their confidence and supply agreement with NZ First.</p>
<p>&quot;On the performance of new recruits on the general mental ability entrance test, the report also finds that &#39;Overall, the changes in pass marks in Examination One support the claim that there is a decline in performance&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an acknowledgement that more people are going to Police College who would not have made it in the past, requiring extra tuition before they graduate.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s all very well for Annette King to say the report &#39;provided assurances that the Police are training recruits to an acceptable standard, and that police are capable of doing their jobs when all their training has been completed&#39; when those who fail are put into the workforce on &#39;limited duties&#39; till they pass the relevant tests.</p>
<p>&quot;That is compromising public safety, and it&#39;s time Annette King admitted it.</p>
<p>&quot;She said there would be no reduction in standards, but that&#39;s what&#39;s happening.&quot;</p>
