<p>Chancellor Jim Bolger and Digger Te Kanawa</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>Renowned Maori weaver Diggeress Te Kanawa has followed in the footsteps of her mother Dame Rangimarie Hetet with the award of an honorary doctorate from the University of Waikato for her dedication to keeping alive the traditions of fine weaving.</p>
<p>Diggeress Rangituatahi Te Kanawa, aged 86 received the honour from the University Chancellor, the Rt Hon. Jim Bolger, at yesterday&#39;s graduation ceremony at the University&#39;s Te Kohinga Marae. Dame Rangimarie was 94 years old when she was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1986.</p>
<p>Conferring the degree, Mr Bolger said an honorary doctorate was the highest accolade the University could bestow.</p>
<p>&quot;It acknowledges your knowledge and your commitment to excellence in the fine art of weaving and your key role in maintaining Maori weaving traditions. It&#39;s a great honour and pleasure for me to confer this degree on you,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Co-founder of Aotearoa Moananui-a-Kiwa Weavers&#39; Association, Mrs Te Kanawa is renowned at local, regional, national and international level as a Tohunga Raranga, Master Artist, and continues to receive recognition and awards at all levels.</p>
<p>Her work is exhibited and held in collections in Europe, the United States and New Zealand, with a recent work commissioned for Te Arikinui King Tuheitia.</p>
<p>Mrs Te Kanawa is the recipient of a number of awards including the 1988 Air New Zealand Travel Awards, the Sir Kingi Ihaka Award (2001), and was made an Icon Artist by the Arts Foundation of New Zealand (2003). She is also the author of &quot;Weaving a Kakahu&quot;– the formal expression of a life committed to weaving.</p>
<p>She has passed on her knowledge to countless students and researchers, with several of her 12 children and many descendents following in her footsteps. With her daughter Kahutoi, she is holder of the elite Toi Iho registered mark of quality and authenticity awarded to artists for their production and promotion of Maori art.</p>
<p>Diggeress Rangituatahi Te Kanawa is of Ngati Maniapoto and Ngati Kinohaku descent. She acknowledges the art passed down to her from her mother Dame Rangimarie Hetet.</p>
<p>She was among 70 students at the marae who graduated on Monday with degrees from the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, the Schools of Education, Computing and Mathematical Sciences, Law, Maori and Pacific Development, Science and Engineering, and Waikato Management School. About 1000 students will graduate in four ceremonies in Hamilton this week.</p>
