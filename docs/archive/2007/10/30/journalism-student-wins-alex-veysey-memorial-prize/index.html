<p>Journalism student wins Alex Veysey Memorial Prize</p>
<p>Matt Chisholm has won this year’s Alex Veysey Memorial Prize, funded by The Dominion Post in honour of the late Wellington journalist.</p>
<p>The prize is available only to Massey journalism students. They vote for the class member who most lives up to Mr Veysey’s reputation for old-fashioned journalism and zest for life.</p>
<p>Mr Chisholm told his classmates he was “humbled” by the award.</p>
<p>“Any one of you could have won it too.”</p>
<p>The fifth student to win the prize, he plans a career as a broadcast journalist.</p>
<p>In awarding the prize Dominion Post editor Tim Pankhurst took a moment to remember his old mate.</p>
<p>“He was a good friend and I miss him. He enjoyed life and loved music. Under the name Ash Burton, Alex recorded some classic country songs.”<br>Mr Veysey worked at both The Dominion and The Evening Post during a career that lasted more than 50 years. He was a sports and political reporter, features editor, and assistant editor. He also wrote several acclaimed books on New Zealand sporting heroes. He died in 2002.</p>
