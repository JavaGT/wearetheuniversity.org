<p><strong>Tuesday, 9 October 2007, 4:15 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Judith Collins MP National Party Welfare Spokeswoman</p>
<p>9 October 2007</p>
<p>Sickness &amp; Invalid benefits reach all time high - again</p>
<p>It will be no surprise that the number of people collecting a sickness and invalid benefit has again reached an all-time high under Labour, says National&#39;s Welfare spokeswoman, Judith Collins.</p>
<p>&quot;According to the latest figures from the Ministry of Social Development, the total number of invalid beneficiaries aged 16 and over is 79,859.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s a whopping 23,678 more than in August 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on current trends, that figure will be over 80,000 next month.</p>
<p>&quot;Unsurprisingly, that trend is mirrored by the number of people on the sickness benefit.</p>
<p>&quot;There are now 49,407 people aged 16 and over collecting this benefit. In August 2000, that number was 32,567.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Collins says Labour has continued its woeful track record in this area, despite continued promises and a series of feel-good programmes to address this shameful trend.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey recently announced a &#39;new&#39; $10 million fund to assist sickness and invalid beneficiaries to return to work.</p>
<p>&quot;He continues to deny that that initiative is spookily similar to his much-vaunted 2004 $20 million fund known as PATHS which he promised would result in thousands of sickness and invalid beneficiaries returning to work.</p>
<p>&quot;He said that in Wellington alone, 4,700 people would benefit from the programme.</p>
<p>&quot;The reality is less than 200 participants have registered for the programme since 2004.</p>
<p>&quot;This alarming and disgraceful trend will only continue under Labour.&quot;</p>
