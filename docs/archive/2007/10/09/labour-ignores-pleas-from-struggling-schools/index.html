<p>Labour ignores pleas from schools struggling with decile changes</p>
<p>Steve Maharey is refusing to listen to pleas to give schools at least a 12-month lead-in time to make adjustments to their funding cuts caused by decile changes, says National&#39;s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister has given schools only three months to find the money they need to compensate for the withdrawal of funding resulting from decile increases.&quot;</p>
<p>After each census there is a routine evaluation of each school&#39;s decile rating. While some schools might go down a decile and receive more funding, others are re-rated upwards to face funding reductions.</p>
<p>&quot;This has shaved an estimated $2.5 million from the operations budgets of secondary schools and potentially $8 million from primary and contributing schools.</p>
<p>&quot;Aotea College in Porirua is $85,000 short and Fairfield Intermediate in Hamilton needs to find another $80,000 a year due to Labour&#39;s changes - three months is simply not long enough to make changes.</p>
<p>&quot;After major economic changes in some communities, some schools have been facing significant decile hikes. One school I have spoken to has jumped from 2 to 5, leading to a major reduction in funding of some $53,000.</p>
<p>&quot;In Otago alone, 53 schools have had a hike in their decile ratings. What this means is less money to spend on things like special education, reading recovery and school trips.</p>
<p>&quot;No school welcomes a reduction, but the issue here is a reasonable transition time to make necessary changes.</p>

<p>&quot;Steve Maharey was asked directly in Parliament today whether he would consider a 12 month lead-in time, and refused to answer, saying instead he would &#39;work with schools on a case-by-case basis.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;However, schools are telling me that Ministry officials have refused to extend the run-in time to 12 months, which has put them in an invidious position.</p>
<p>&quot;It is only fair that schools are given the leeway to find the money to fulfil the funding shortfall.&quot;</p>
