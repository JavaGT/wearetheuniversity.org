<h3>Revolutionary skateboard wins &#39;BeST&#39; award</h3>
<p>An all-terrain in-line board and an animation focusing on computer dependency have won top awards for Massey design students and staff.</p>
<p>Industrial design graduate Ben Thomsen, now a tutor on the Auckland campus, collected a gold award at the &quot;Best&quot; Awards, held last Friday, for creating a skateboard designed to move on grass.</p>
<p>Judges of the Designers Institute national award programme say his entry showed an ability to challenge traditional solutions for human-powered vehicles.</p>
<p>&quot;The designer present a credible solution that is aligned in form, materials and finish with the proposed market.&quot;</p>
<p>In the interactive media and website design category, Wellington graduate Caroline Ting won a gold award for her animation, titled Computer Dependency, pictured at right.</p>
<p>Judges called it the best animation at student level they saw. &quot;The observation and character building was outstanding in this engaging and delightful work by a truly gifted student.&quot;</p>
<p>In the student spatial design category, Lauren Skogstad and Gemma Devonport-Ward won a gold award for Disseminate + Densify. Judges said they took a brief and executed the concept through to its natural conclusion. &quot;This has been explained well showing a strong understanding of process and presentation.&quot;</p>
<p>Auckland School of Design regional director Azhar Mohamed, says success at the awards confirms that Massey&#39;s research-led approach to design is finding favour with industry.</p>
