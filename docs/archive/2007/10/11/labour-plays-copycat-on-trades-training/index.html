<p>Labour plays copycat on trades training</p>
<p>Labour’s belated concern for trades training in schools does not go nearly far enough, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>Steve Maharey launched a timid pilot scheme today that will give secondary school students industry-based training, tertiary education, and work experience in trades while still at school.</p>
<p>“John Key launched National’s Trades Training In Schools policy four months ago and it is far more comprehensive than the patchy pilot launched by the Minister today.</p>
<p>“Steve Maharey says the Youth Apprenticeship pilot is ‘a key priority in the Labour-led government’s commitment to realise youth potential and provide more highly skilled workers to transform the New Zealand economy’.</p>
<p>“Labour does not have the courage of its convictions. Only 10 schools will benefit from this pilot. If Labour truly believed that trades training is the answer, they should stand up and be counted with a policy that is inclusive and comprehensive.</p>
<p>“This issue has moved well beyond toe-in-the-water pilots. There is the knowledge and capacity now to implement a full programme if Labour had the political will.</p>
<p>“John Key said when he launched National’s trades training paper that ‘We wantall students in all secondary schools, in all areas to be able to take part in hands-on learning in a range of industries.’</p>
<p>“People should judge Steve Maharey’s announcement for what it is; a cynical attempt to get trades training off the political agenda.”</p>
