<p>Canterbury Medical Research Foundation grants awarded</p>
<p>Health researchers at the University of Otago, Christchurch have been awarded nearly $385,000 in project grants by the Canterbury Medical Research Foundation as part of its annual grant round for 2007.</p>
<p>All these studies rely on contributions from the Foundation and its members who have been supporting health research in Canterbury for 46 years. More details can be found at <a href="http://www.cmrf.org.nz">www.cmrf.org.nz</a></p>
<p>Professor Gary Nicholls,Christchurch Cardioendocrine Research, has been granted $74,563 to research how hormones expressed by the heart may be used as an indicator of possible kidney failure, and assist with the management of patients undergoing renal dialysis.</p>
<p>Dr Leigh Ellmers,Christchurch Cardioendocrine Research, has received $74,478 to investigate the Urocortin family of hormones as a possible therapeutic agent in ameliorating damage to the heart after a heart attack.</p>
<p>Dr Barry Palmer, Christchurch Cardioendocrine Research , has received $66,983 to study three genes from the X chromosome which are related to the cardiovascular system. The aim is to determine genetic variation in these genes and to allow genetic testing to aid clinical management.</p>
<p>Professor Tim Anderson,Van der Veer Institute, has received $74,394 to research whether rapid eye movements can be used as biomarkers for determining disease status in Parkinson’s Disease, and to correlate these with information from MRI scans across a patient cohort.</p>

<p>Dr Margreet Vissers, Free Radical Research, has received $69,851 to research how Vitamin C may be beneficial for controlling the growth and survival of cancer tumours. Dr Vissers will investigate the effect of Vitamin C in a range of tumour cell types.</p>
<p>Dr Judith McKenzie, Haematology Research, has been awarded $14,378 to investigate how chronic lymphocytic leukaemia affects the immune system by expressing a particular protein. Understanding how this works could lead to new treatments for our most common leukaemia.</p>
<p>Dr Kenny Chitcholtan, Helicobacter Research, has received $10,000 to investigate how H.pylori alters the integrity of primary gastric epithelial cells. H.pylori in the stomach is associated with the development of severe inflammation, peptic ulcers and gastric cancer.</p>
