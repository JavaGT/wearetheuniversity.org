<p><strong>Wednesday, 31 October 2007, 9:29 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University">Massey University</a></strong></p>
<p>Summer school enrolments quadruple in three years</p>
<p>Demand for summer school continues to grow across the three Massey campuses and extramurally as more students take the opportunity to finish courses or start new ones earlier.</p>
<p>Others enrol in summer school papers purely out of interest and Massey&#39;s renowned extramural programmes enable many to study from home, or even the beach.</p>
<p>The number of papers available has increased by more than a third in recent years to more than 230, but the number of enrolments has more than quadrupled. Three years ago there were about 1800 enrolments each summer but last summer there were more than 7500. About half are studying extramurally.</p>
<p>Many internal students continue their study into the third semester and many students at other universities use Massey’s Summer School to pick up papers they can credit back to their own university. There is also a growing number of new students for whom Summer School is their first time back at university – or their first taste.</p>
<p>Massey has even created a provisional entry status to allow Year-13 secondary students to start prior to receiving their final year marks. Most of these students take foundation papers in subjects such as chemistry, maths or physics – core papers for many science degrees.</p>
<p>Acting Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Academic) Professor Nigel Long says there is no “typical” Summer School student, with courses catering for a diverse range of ages and circumstances.</p>
<p>“For some it allows them to start study early and get a head start, for others it’s an opportunity to finish their programme of study faster,&quot; Professor Long says. &quot;Others it allows to pursue a new interest. It also can fit in very nicely with people’s work schedules while they have some time off during January and February and want to use it productively.”</p>
<p>Summer School begins on 19 November and enrolments are still being accepted.</p>
