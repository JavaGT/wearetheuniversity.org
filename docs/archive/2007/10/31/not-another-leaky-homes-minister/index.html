<p><strong>Wednesday, 31 October 2007, 2:47 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Dr Nick Smith MP<br>National Party Building &amp; Construction Spokesman<br>31 October 2007</p>
<p>Not another leaky homes Minister</p>
<p>“Responsibility for overseeing the fixing of thousands of leaky homes is being passed around the Cabinet table like a hot potato”, says National’s Building and Construction spokesman Hon Dr Nick Smith.</p>
<p>“Shane Jones is the 10th Minister in eight years. There has been no continuity of leadership, and it is little wonder the problems continue to compound.”</p>
<p>The 10 Labour Ministers who have had responsibility for leaky homes have been:<br>Mark Burton (1999)<br>George Hawkins (2000)<br>Rick Barker (2001)<br>Lianne Dalziel (2002)<br>John Tamihere (2003)<br>Margaret Wilson (2004)<br>Chris Carter (2005)<br>Clayton Cosgrove (2006)<br>Mark Burton (2007)</p>
<p>“The problem has also been passed between departments like an unwanted orphan. It started with the Department of Internal Affairs, moved to the Department of Building and Housing, and was transferred earlier this year to the Ministry of Justice. The Government has simultaneously had four attempts to get the law right.</p>
<p>“Minister Hawkins promised in 2002 that this problem would be solved within a couple of years. After five years and $100 million spent on cumbersome bureaucracy, less than 15% of the more than 5000 claims have been resolved.</p>
<p>“This Government has failed on the leaky homes issue and another change of Minister is the last thing leaky home owners needs.”</p>
