<p>About the Lincoln University sports scholarship programme</p>
<p>Lincoln University created the Sports Scholarship programme in partnership with sporting codes including Canterbury Cricket Association, Canterbury Hockey, Canterbury Golf, Mainland Soccer, Canterbury Netball, and Canterbury Rugby Football Union. This year the University has added a new Elite sporting category that makes it possible for sportspeople from any discipline who are competing at representative level, to also apply for the scholarship programme.</p>
<p>The Programme is designed to assist young sportspeople from around New Zealand to achieve their academic and sporting goals.</p>
<p>The programme has brought top sports performers to Lincoln University where they combine academic study with the extension and development of their athletic and sporting abilities through a focused training programme and access to topflight facilities and staff.</p>
<p>Scholarship recipients must be academically capable and demonstrate a commitment to complete a degree programme. Academic success is an essential part of the programme and the scholars must pass their university papers in order to retain their scholarships.</p>
<p>In addition to meeting the academic criteria for selection, candidates should have demonstrated success in one of the programme&#39;s sporting codes at a representative level or have the potential to achieve success.</p>
<p>Lincoln University will assist scholarship recipients with their study selections and their planning to ensure that their goals are achieved.</p>
<p>Previous and current successful Lincoln sports scholars include:</p>
<p>Richie McCaw and Andy Ellis (rugby); Michael Papps and Kate Pulford (cricket); Jo McCaw, Sarah Barnes and Katie Ritchie (netball); Jo Galletly, Jane Maley and Hugh Copland (hockey); Kristian Hutton and Georgia Goulding (soccer); Rodney Yee, Dean Cameron and May Chang (golf).</p>
