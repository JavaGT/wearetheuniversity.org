<p>Top policy scholars to receive Prime Minister&#39;s awards</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Helen Clark, will present prizes to the top scholars in the University&#39;s School of Government’s programmes at the School’s fifth anniversary celebrations tonight.</p>
<p>The celebrations will be held in the Banquet Hall, Parliament Buildings, starting from 4pm.</p>
<p>Launched in 2002, the School of Government has since established itself as a leader in public policy analysis and research.</p>
<p>&quot;In February this year, the Government decided to invest $4 million in our School, as well as $6 million to the Australia and New Zealand School of Government, of which Victoria is a founding partner,” says Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh.</p>
<p>“This demonstrates our standing as a leading provider of education to the public sector.</p>
<p>“It is a privilege to be able to instil academic skills and knowledge to public servants, and we are pleased the Government recognises this ability.”</p>
<p>Ms Clark will present seven prizes, three of which are Prime Minister&#39;s Prizes for the best all-round academic performance in public policy, public management, and strategic studies.</p>
<p>Details of the winners:</p>
<p>Gerald Leather has worked as an advisor to human rights and legal aid organisations in Cambodia, and will receive the Prime Minister&#39;s Prize in Public Policy. During his Master&#39;s in Public Policy degree, he wrote a research paper on the new Cambodian Criminal Procedure Code.</p>
<p>Gary McAdam, Manager, Strategy and Planning in the NZ Customs Service, will receive the Prime Minister&#39;s Prize in Public Management for research that focused on the State Services Development Goals and sought to determine the factors that had influenced the ways in which departments had responded to those goals.</p>
