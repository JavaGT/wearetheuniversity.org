<p>Dr Paul Hutchison MP<br>National Party Tertiary Education Spokesman</p>

<p>Cullen&#39;s tertiary reforms off to disastrous start</p>
<p>Michael Cullen&#39;s tertiary reforms are off to a shocking start with the last minute news today that Otago University won&#39;t be receiving the funding that the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) had indicated, says National&#39;s Tertiary Education spokesman, Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s so-called reforms are supposed to be &#39;high trust and low compliance&#39;, but after months of negotiation the university has been let down by TEC three hours before the agreement was due to be signed.</p>
<p>&quot;TEC has a huge bureaucracy of over 340 staff, and has hired 13 &#39;investment&#39; managers and 13 &#39;strategic stakeholder&#39; managers in order to help &#39;streamline&#39; the plans.</p>
<p>&quot;If this is an example of Michael Cullen&#39;s streamlining, we should be very afraid.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past eight years Labour has made numerous attempts to reform tertiary education. This has cost over $400 million, and resulted in no gains. This money would have been much better spent on education, rather than bureaucrats.</p>
<p>&quot;It is ominous that even before the tertiary reforms have been formally implemented, a major university such as Otago has been let down at the eleventh hour.&quot;</p>
