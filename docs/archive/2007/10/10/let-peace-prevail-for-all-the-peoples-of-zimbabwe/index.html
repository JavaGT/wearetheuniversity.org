<p>&#39;Let peace prevail for all the peoples of Zimbabwe&#39;</p>
<p>Dr Pita Sharples, Co-leader of the Maori Party</p>
<p>Tuesday 9 October 2007</p>
<p>The Maori Party has today released a statement, following a caucus briefing with leading Zimbabwe political figure, Sekai Holland.</p>
<p>The Maori Party supports the initiative taken by Southern African Development Community (SADC) in bringing together Zimbabwe President H. E Robert Mugabe and the other member nations.</p>
<p>“The important point for us – is that African nations have indicated that mediation and talks are their immediate priority – and we believe it is appropriate that the Maori Party supports their aspirations for such talks to take place” said Dr Pita Sharples, Co-leader of the Maori Party.</p>
<p>“We do, however, condemn the extreme violence that occurred in the attacks of March 11 this year – which the talks seek to address” said Dr Pita Sharples.</p>
<p>“The Caucus was briefed this morning about the fatal shooting of Mr Gift Tandare, youth chair of the National Constitutional Assembly in Harare, as well as being alerted to the numbers of members from the Movement for Democratic Change that were assaulted and taken into custody, including Sekai Holland” said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>“If such violence continues, the talks will inevitably fail” said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>“The hope of the people, is that these talks will pave the way for a free and fair election in which all Zimbabwe people, including the four million or so who live outside of their homeland, are able to take up their democratic right to a vote”.</p>

<p>“Ms Holland talked to us about the way in which abuse by one person, brings shame to the whole community” said Dr Sharples. “She shared also that the solutions are to be found in focusing on their own unique culture and indigenous mechanisms to assist the people in their journey to peace, justice, equality and development”.</p>
<p>&quot;These are values that we uphold as Maori, and are indeed, part of the common beliefs of indigenous peoples across the world&quot;.</p>
<p>“We endorse the call for the United Nations to give urgent priority for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance to be provided to Zimbabwe” said Sharples.</p>
<p>“The key point that has been shared with us is that reconciliation and liberation can only be achieved with the full involvement of all leaders of the South African Development Community working together, including President Mugabe” said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>&quot;The irony of the current situation is that the struggle for liberation of which Dr Mugabe was a leading figure has turned into another struggle for liberation in which it was reported to us, that sadly Dr Mugabe is now the oppressor of his own people. We are hopeful that a peaceful resolution initiated by the Southern African Development Community will eventuate for all the people of Zimbabwe&quot; said Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>“We endorse the call of the Movement for Democratic Change and of many Zimbabwe people for the United Nations to give urgent priority for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance to be provided to Zimbabwe” said Sharples.</p>
<p>“The violence must stop; the talks must proceed unhindered; and the United Nations must step in and acknowledge the crisis that is occurring in Zimbabwe” ended Dr Sharples.</p>
