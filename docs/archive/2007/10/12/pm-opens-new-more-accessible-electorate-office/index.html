<p>PM Opens New, More Accessible Maharey Office</p>
<p>Prime Minister opens new, more accessible electorate office</p>
<p>The Prime Minister Helen Clark is today officially opening Steve Maharey&#39;s new electorate office in Palmerston North.</p>
<p>Steve Maharey says the relocation marks the end of an era, after four decades of having this community facility on Ferguson Street.</p>
<p>&quot;The new office on Princess Street is a huge improvement, providing an open, warm and fresh environment that is closer to the city centre and way more accessible for constituents in Palmerston North.</p>
<p>&quot;More than 1200 locals came to our office for help in the past year in its previous location - I expect that figure to grow with our new site.</p>
<p>&quot;The new modern facilities are highly visible, right in the middle of the city&#39;s retail area, putting our services on the doorstep of thousands of people.</p>
<p>&quot;We encourage you to drop in so we can help you with a range of support, from liaising with government agencies on issues like immigration or housing, handling JP nominations, making a submission to a Parliamentary Select Committee, or even organising a petition.</p>
<p>&quot;Our services are free and anyone can use them. We&#39;re open on Monday to Friday from 8.30 - 5. I&#39;m generally in Palmerston North on a Friday, and hold clinics on Saturday mornings from 10 - 12 midday.&quot;</p>
<p>ENDS  </p>
