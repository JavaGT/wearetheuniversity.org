<p><strong>Friday, 12 October 2007, 9:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Aotearoa_Student_Press_Association">Aotearoa Student Press Association</a></strong></p>
<h3>Craccum named best student publication for 2007</h3>
<p>Auckland University&#39;s Craccum has deposed Critic as New Zealand&#39;s best student magazine after they took away the top prize at the annual Fairfax Media ASPA Awards, held at Massey University Wellington 6th October.</p>
<p>A panel of media experts including a panel of senior Metro writers and Suzanne Carty, Editorial Executive for the Dominion Post, awarded Craccum the top honour, Carty describing the magazine as &quot;irreverent, smart, and all in all, pretty bloody good&quot;.</p>
<p>The Metro panel said Craccum possessed a &quot;sophisticated wit throughout, and a determination to get under the skin of its subjects. They assume their readers are intelligent and have good knowledge.&quot;</p>
<p>Craccum also won the &quot;Best Reviewer&quot; and &quot;Best Education Series&quot; categories, of the latter of which Jim Tucker, former head of the Journalism Training Organisation, commented, &quot;It was an excellent journalistic package that bettered most comparable coverage in the mainstream media.&quot;</p>
<p>Unlike last year&#39;s awards, in which Otago&#39;s Critic magazine scooped seven of the sixteen prizes on offer, the remaining honours were spread out amongst the bulk of the other publications. Victoria University&#39;s Salient won three first placings and was awarded third best Publication, with Critic the runner-up.</p>
<p>Massey University&#39;s Wellington Campus publication Magneto once again scooped the &quot;Best Small Publication Category&quot; for the second year running, Suzanne Carty, Editorial Executive at The Dominion Post saying Magento was &quot;an entertaining and informative magazine, being both marvellously offensive and readable at the same time.&quot;</p>

<p>Other winners on the night included Matt Russell and Nick Gibb from Chaff (Massey Palmerston North), who won &quot;Best Feature Writer&quot; and &quot;Best Cover Design&quot; respectively. Laura McQuillian from Salient managed to take away the &quot;Best News Writer&quot; award, with Rosalind Case from Nexus (Waikato University) winning &quot;Best Editorial Writer.&quot;</p>
<p>The Aotearoa Student Press Association comprises 13 publications from the country&#39;s university and polytechnic campuses. This year&#39;s were the fifth annual awards, the first to be held in association with Fairfax Media.</p>
<p>2007 Fairfax Media ASPA Awards Results</p>
<p>Best Original Photography</p>
<p>3rd: Salient 2nd: Critic 1st: In Unison</p>
<p>Judged by Wayne Barrar - Head of the Department of Photography, Massey University</p>
<p>&quot;In essence, they have thought about how it could look on the page. It has a good sense of humour and is competently controlled technically.&quot;</p>
<p>Best Cartoonist</p>
<p>3rd: Moskonovitch - Nexus 2nd: Matt Russell and Nick Ward - Chaff 1st: Michael Leung - Canta</p>
<p>Judged by Grant Buist - Cartoonist and Playwright</p>
<p>&quot;Leung&#39;s drawings have a disturbing, nightmarish quality. If Tim Burton and David Lynch drew cartoons, this is what they&#39;d look like.&quot;</p>
<p>Best Sports Writer</p>
<p>3rd Equal: Daniel Markham - Satellite Will Mace - Magneto 1st Equal: Chris Matthews - Debate</p>
<p>Judged by Joseph Romanos - The Dominion Post</p>
<p>&quot;It struck an irreverent tone without being smart-alecy.&quot;</p>
<p>1st Equal: Michael Oliver - Salient</p>
<p>Judged by Elspeth Tilley - Communications lecturer and sports writer, Massey University</p>
<p>&quot;He was insightfully critical but never too strident or mocking.&quot;</p>
<p>Best Education Series</p>
<p>3rd Equal: In Unison Magneto 2nd: Salient 1st: Craccum</p>
<p>Judged by Jim Tucker - former head of the Journalism Training Organisation.</p>
<p>&quot;It was an excellent journalistic package that bettered most comparable coverage in the mainstream media.&quot;</p>
<p>Best News Writer - Unpaid</p>
<p>3rd: Bronwyn Bent - In Unison 2nd: Jeff Bell - Canta 1st: Jonathon Howe - Magneto</p>
<p>Judged by Nicky Hager - Investigative Journalist</p>
<p>&quot;I thought Jonathon&#39;s articles were clear, well written, relevant to the readers, and on issues that matter. Congratulations.&quot;</p>
<p>Best Cover</p>
<p>3rd Equal: Canta Debate 1st Equal: Critic</p>
<p>Judged by Chris Elder - Former Salient Designer</p>
<p>&quot;I liked the simplicity of Critic&#39;s entries and felt they were made eye-catching through their attention to detail&quot;</p>
<p>1st Equal: Chaff</p>
<p>Judged by Chris Elder - Former Salient Designer</p>
<p>&quot;The Yam issue rated as my favourite cover from this year&#39;s crop. It was colourful, well shot, nicely finished and somewhat left-field.&quot; Best Reviewer</p>
<p>3rd: Aaron Hawkins - Critic 2nd: William Muirhead - Chaff 1st: Joe Nunweek - Craccum</p>
<p>Judged by Richard Thorn, New Zealand Musician editor.</p>
<p>&quot;Likeably self-revealing and convincingly honest.&quot;</p>
<p>Best Columnist</p>
<p>3rd: Jose&#39;s Corner - In Unison 2nd: The Honourable Nancy - Satellite 1st: Kate Newton - Critic</p>
<p>Judged by Karl du Fresne - Fairfax Columnist</p>
<p>&quot;Kate Newton is a stylish and witty writer whose work wouldn&#39;t look out of place in a mainstream publication. Sparky and engaging, she rejects the self-absorbed approach, looking beyond herself and the university campus for her subject matter.&quot;</p>
<p>Best Humour Content</p>
<p>3rd: Will Hine - Magneto 2nd: Tristan Egarr - Salient 1st: Iain Dangerfield - Critic</p>
<p>Judged by Matt Nippert - The Listener</p>
<p>&quot;The most sophisticated and satisfying of all ten entrants, and easily the most internally coherent. Ian Dangerfield, raise your goblet of funny - you are indeed worthy.&quot;</p>
<p>Best Feature Writer</p>
<p>3rd: Ryan Boyd - Debate 2nd: Matt Littlewood - Critic 1st: Matt Russell - Chaff</p>
<p>Judged by Gordon Campbell - former Listener staff writer and Green Party media officer</p>
<p>&quot;Matt Russell is able to pull off a high risk style of writing - of personalised comment and analysis, yet without making his subject secondary to his arsenal of stylistic flourishes. There&#39;s a lot of him on the page, but the finished pieces didn&#39;t seem overly self-indulgent - always the risk with writing that&#39;s this &#39;big&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>Best Editorial Writer</p>
<p>3rd: David Large - Critic 2nd: Rory MacKinnon - In Unison 1st: Rosalind Case - Nexus</p>
<p>Judged by Sue Ingram - Radio New Zealand</p>
<p>&quot;Roz Case was by far the best writer with a lilting tone that was easy to read and ideas set out in well-structured pieces.&quot;</p>
<p>Best News Writer - Paid</p>
<p>3rd Equal: Rory MacKinnon - In Unison Matt Russell - Chaff 2nd: Amy Joseph - Critic 1st: Laura McQuillan - Salient</p>
<p>Judged by Nick Brown - NZPA Editor</p>
<p>&quot;Clear, hard-hitting reporting, without fear or favour.&quot;</p>
<p>Best Feature Content</p>
<p>3rd Equal: Craccum Debate 2nd: Critic 1st: Salient</p>
<p>Judged by Grant Hannis, Head of the Massey Journalism Programme &quot;The standard was very good across all three features. In particular, &quot;Get Rich Quick!&quot; was a novel and illuminating topic relevant to a student audience, written in a mature, assured style.&quot; Best Design</p>
<p>3rd: Chaff 2nd: Magneto 1st: In Unison</p>
<p>Judged by Mark Bradford - Senior lecturer in Visual Communications and Design, Massey University.</p>
<p>&quot;A pleasure to pick up and read! In Unison is packed full of personality powered by a flexible design system and evidence of a good understanding that is not patronising of the associated student audience.&quot;</p>
<p>Best Small Publication</p>
<p>3rd: Satellite 2nd: In Unison 1st: Magneto</p>
<p>Judged by Suzanne Carty - Editorial Executive, The Dominion Post.</p>
<p>&quot;This was an entertaining and informative magazine, being both marvellously offensive and readable at the same time.&quot;</p>
<p>Best Publication</p>
<p>3rd: Salient</p>
<p>Judged by a panel of senior Metro writers</p>
<p>&quot;Salient is attention grabbing multi sourced journalism that is in tune with its student readers.&quot;</p>
<p>2nd: Critic</p>
<p>Suzanne Carty - Editorial Executive, The Dominion Post</p>
<p>&quot;Critic is an energetic publication, has lots to read, high production values, and it keeps the readers&#39; attention throughout.&quot;</p>
<p>Best Publication 1st Place: Craccum</p>
<p>Suzanne Carty - Editorial Executive, The Dominion Post</p>
<p>&quot;This magazine doesn&#39;t take itself too seriously - unless it wants to. It is irreverent, smart, and all in all, pretty bloody good.&quot;</p>
<p>A panel of senior Metro writers</p>
<p>&quot;This publication lives on the edge with sophisticated wit throughout and a determination to get under the skin of its subjects. They assume their readers are intelligent and have good knowledge.&quot;</p>
<p>Martin Hirst - Associate Professor in Journalism, AUT</p>
<p>&quot;Their slightly larger format makes it attractive - it gives the designers a bit more space too.&quot;</p>
