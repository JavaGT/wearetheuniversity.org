<p>Risk: Reality Or Running From Shadows?</p>
<p>This week I was invited to speak to a special forum at Victoria<br>University, where the topic of discussion was: &quot;the effect of<br>anti-terrorism laws on civil liberties and whether the right balance has<br>been struck&quot;. My speech can be found at<br><a href="http://www.act.org.nz/civil%5C_liberties%5C_have%5C_we%5C_reached%5C_the%5C_right%5C_balance">www.act.org.nz/civil\_liberties\_have\_we\_reached\_the\_right\_balance</a></p>
<p>The crux of the matter rests with the concept of risk: how likely is it<br>that we will be targeted by terrorists? What assessments have been made<br>to calculate the risk? And are the measures implemented adequate to<br>protect us, without unnecessarily hindering our movements and our<br>freedoms? My experiences show that the concept of risk is not widely<br>understood by the public at large.</p>
<p>In my former life as a physiotherapist, I ran a Cardiac Rehabilitation<br>programme for people who had suffered a heart attack or experienced severe<br>angina. Part of the programme included educational discussions around<br>smoking and diet. My job was to explain that smoking and a high-fat diet<br>meant that each patient was more likely to suffer further heart symptoms -<br>another heart attack or a worsening of angina. Most patients couldn&#39;t -<br>and a small minority wouldn&#39;t - grasp the concept and instead regaled the<br>group with stories of Great Uncle Tom, who smoked a pack a day from age 10<br>and lived to the ripe old age of 96 without ever taking a sick day.</p>
<p>This, they concluded, meant they could continue smoking without suffering<br>any ill effects. Likewise, we would discuss diet at great length; I would<br>outline the benefits of lowering one&#39;s cholesterol levels with a low-fat<br>diet rich in fruit and vegetables. I vividly remember one woman coming<br>back the next week armed with &#39;proof&#39; that I was completely wrong: the &#39;NZ<br>Woman&#39;s Weekly&#39; - that great bastion of medical science - was waved in<br>front of me; apparently chocolate had many beneficial properties that I<br>was overlooking, while pumpkin was a &#39;sweet&#39; vegetable that definitely<br>should not be eaten. That day I discovered that it&#39;s very difficult to<br>argue with the &#39;Woman&#39;s Weekly&#39;.</p>

<p>Political commentator Colin James recently spoke to an ACT Conference. As<br>part of his speech he talked about risk. He asked our group several<br>questions:<br>* &quot;Why do we put up with indignities at airports?&quot;<br>* &quot;Why is the world&#39;s most powerful nation also the most scared?<br>* &quot;Why are we emulating these quivering wrecks?&quot;<br>* &quot;Why do we write rules that don&#39;t allow children to experiment and<br>experience cause and consequence?&quot;</p>
<p>All are very good questions. Why do we put up with all of these things?<br>The simple answer is, of course, that we have to: if you don&#39;t comply with<br>the regulations around playground safety you receive a bad ERO report and<br>may ultimately loose your licence; if you don&#39;t subject your hand luggage<br>to the airport X-Ray machine examination and go through the metal detector<br>- parting with your knitting needles, tweezers and pocket knife along the<br>way - you can&#39;t board the plane. You have no choice, and we in ACT don&#39;t<br>like having no choice.</p>
<p>The broader answer is that we allow ourselves to be ordered around, and<br>allow laws to be put in place that do indeed restrict our freedoms. If<br>Judith Tizard can knit in Parliament, why can&#39;t I knit on a plane if I<br>want to? I have no intention of spearing the pilot to death and taking<br>control of the plane and nor, I believe, do any other Kiwis. Yet, we<br>meekly comply.</p>
<p>At this broader level we do have choices. We can elect politicians - of<br>both the local body and central government variety - who value freedom and<br>will vote against by-laws, regulations and bills that unnecessarily<br>restrict it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately more and more people are not exercising their right to<br>choose. The local body elections currently underway show a record low<br>turnout to date - possibly only around one third of eligible voters<br>returning their voting papers. If they think it doesn&#39;t matter, they&#39;re<br>very wrong.</p>
<p>Risk is a part of everyday life. Risk can&#39;t be eliminated completely - no<br>matter how hard the control freaks try - because life is an unpredictable<br>business. Frequently forgotten is the fact that our minds and bodies are<br>natural risk assessors, and are remarkably good at telling us when it&#39;s<br>not safe to do something. The secret, of course, is getting the balance<br>right.</p>
<p>Our forebears fought hard for our freedoms, many paying the ultimate<br>sacrifice with their lives. Today marks the 90th anniversary of the<br>Battle of Passchendaele. October 12 1917 was the most tragic day in New<br>Zealand&#39;s military history when, in just two hours, more than 2,800 men<br>were killed, wounded or listed as missing in action. These freedom<br>fighters did not risk their all to see our children wrapped in cotton<br>wool; our airports so risk averse that any possible weapon is confiscated<br>&quot;just in case&quot;; our civil liberties eroded bit by bit. They must be<br>looking down on us today in puzzlement, thinking we have allowed the<br>Muslim extremists to win.</p>
<p>Lest We Forget - The First Battle of Passchendaele (October 12 1917)<br>This morning I attended a wreath-laying ceremony to commemorate the 90th<br>anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele.</p>
<p>Passchendale began the war as a small village in western Flanders, near<br>Belgium&#39;s border with France; by the end of the battle it had been reduced<br>to dust, such was the intensity of the shelling. The village was<br>unfortunate to end up on the front, at a strategically important point.<br>The offensive was aimed at reaching the coast and capturing German<br>submarine bases but, in the depressingly familiar pattern of World War I,<br>a small advance was made after enduring high casualties.</p>
<p>Passchendaele introduced a new enemy to the legion of things from which a<br>soldier can die - this time, mud was an enemy. Although no doubt an<br>irritant to soldiers since time immemorial, at Passchendaele mud became a<br>killer in its own right. The farmland around the town was re-claimed<br>swamp and required a system of dykes and pumps to remain viable farming<br>land.</p>
<p>With these dykes and pumps blown asunder by the first artillery<br>bombardment, the allied advance became literally bogged down and<br>ammunition had to be brought up by mule. Wooden planks were laid over the<br>mud to enable movement, but if a man in full kit stumbled into the mud he<br>was hard put to get out again.</p>
<p>Today we owe it to those who fought for our freedom to continue to fight<br>against tyranny, but often the fight does not need a war - in the &#39;war&#39;<br>against terror we must be careful not to become authoritarians like those<br>we oppose. We must remain better than the Islamic fundamentalists, or we<br>concede them at least one victory.</p>
