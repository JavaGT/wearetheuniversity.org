<p><strong>Sunday, 14 October 2007, 12:21 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>______________________________________________________________<br>Blues Awards for Victoria&#39;s best sportspeople</p>
<p>Victoria’s supreme athletes and administrators from a variety of sports will be honoured at the 42nd Annual Victoria University Blues Awards on Friday 12 October.</p>
<p>The Blues are the highest recognition the University can give to people who have, by their sporting achievements or contribution to sport, brought credit to the institution. They are awarded by the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association on the recommendation of the Blues Panel consisting of the representatives of the Victoria University Sports Council and two appointed members, both of which are highly respected in the Wellington sports industry.</p>
<p>Former Blues winners include All Blacks Graham Mourie, Jerry Collins and Conrad Smith, World Mountain Running Champ Jonathan Wyatt, and Black Stick Suzie Pearce.</p>
<p>The Guest Speaker for the evening is Jamie Fitzgerald – best known as the first person to complete an unsupported expedition to the South Pole in 2007 and winning the two-person rowing race across the Atlantic Ocean in world record time (both achievements with partner Kevin Biggar).</p>
<p>The awards will be held at the The Boatshed on Taranaki Wharf from 6.30pm. The two major awards, the 2007 Sportsperson of the Year and 2007 Sports Administrator of the Year will be presented by Jamie Fitzgerald at the conclusion of the ceremony, and 40 students will receive sports and administration Blues.</p>
