<p>Tell the truth about the Bus says Waiariki MP,</p>
<p>Te Ururoa Flavell</p>
<p>Tuesday 23 October 2007</p>
<p>Te Ururoa Flavell has today released a letter he has sent to the Minister of Education, asking him to clarify the truth to claims that New Zealand police boarded school buses during their &#39;anti-terrorism&#39; raids on<br>Ruatoki and Taneatua last Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The claims that the Minister made in the House last Thursday, have been disputed by various members of the affected community, including one of the bus drivers, Issac Nuku&quot; confirmed Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>&quot;It is somewhat ironic that the humble bus which transports our tamariki to kohanga reo and kura kaupapa has become a key player in the raids made against Tuhoe over the last week&quot; said Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>&quot;Activists and peacemakers throughout the world, know of the significance of the Montgomery Bus Boycott which signalled the start of a revolutionary era of non-violent mass protests in support of civil rights in America&quot; said Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>&quot;Issac Nuku, just like Rosa Parks, has refused to go along with a line of truth being promoted, which denies that police or members of the armed defenders squad boarded the bus&quot; said Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>&quot;In the interests of our most vulnerable, our children, we expect the Minister to bother to care about questions such as whether police did or didn&#39;t board buses, whether they were armed or unarmed, whether they were in combat gear and whether they did indeed search the vehicles&quot;.</p>

<p>23 October 2007</p>
<p>Hon Steve Maharey Minister of Education PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS</p>
<p>Tena Koe Steve</p>
<p>Last Thursday 18 October 2007, I made a specific request for clarification that a van belonging to Te Kohanga Reo o Taneatua was &quot;reportedly boarded by an armed defenders squad in full combat gear with guns&quot;. In the response you gave to my questions, you confirmed at four separate occasions, that you could advise that no police boarded the bus.</p>
<p>You will be aware now that there has been considerable dispute in the public arena, about the accuracy of these statements. I enclose a media statement of 19 October 2007 (Driver adamant police searched bus) which confirms that the driver of the kohanga reo bus, Issac Nuku, has stated that &quot;They (police) did hop on our bus and they did search our bus&quot;.</p>
<p>I would like to provide you with the opportunity, under Standing Order 350, to make a personal explanation to the House to clarify whether the responses you gave in the attached transcript were misleading the House or not.</p>
<p>Heoi ano</p>
<p>3. TE URUROA FLAVELL (Māori Party—Waiariki) to the Minister of Education: Kua tae atu te tohutohu ki a ia, ko tētahi o ngā tino kaupapa nui kua kitea e ngā whakawhitinga whakaaro mō te kape tuatahi o te Rautaki Mātauranga Māori, arā, a Ka Hikitia, ko “te mahitahi a ngā pokapū Kāwanatanga, ko tā rātau hono hoki, tētahi ki tētahi”, ā, he aha rawa ngā rautaki kua whakaritea kia tino kore ai ngā mahi a ētahi atu tari Kāwanatanga e tukituki i ngā wawata o ērā e whai ana i ngā ara mātauranga?</p>
<p>[Has he been advised that consultation on the draft Māori education strategy, Ka Hikitia, has identified that one of the themes that participants think is important is “Government agencies working together in a collaborative and connected way”, and what strategies are being put in place to ensure that activities in other departments do not unduly compromise educational opportunities?]</p>
<p>Hon STEVE MAHAREY (Minister of Education): A call for Government agencies to work together in a more collaborative and connected way is not new, but it is important. That is why it is in Ka Hikitia. The Ministry of Education regularly works with key education and Government agencies on a wide range of issues. It is certainly my expectation that where the actions of one department will have an impact on another, they will work together to minimise that impact.<br>Te Ururoa Flavell: What advice has the Minister received about the impact of New Zealand Police actions on kōhanga reo and kura located in Rūātoki Waimana, Matahi, and Tāneatua, following the fact that the Rūātoki community was locked down, roads were sealed, and people were isolated during the raids of Monday, 15 October?</p>
<p>Hon STEVE MAHAREY: I am not fully briefed on police operations this week. The member would probably need to direct his question to the Minister of Police to get more detail on what actually took place. But I would like to point out that the police operation was independently initiated by the police. It was a country-wide operation that impacted on a wide range of people from a wide range of backgrounds and circumstances. We are all waiting to see what exactly will arise from the police activities.</p>
<p>With regard to, for example, the alleged boarding of the school bus, which I took some particular interest in, I advise that no police boarded that bus. The bus was facilitated through the roadblocks where there were armed police. Of course, it impacted on the schools that day, but my understanding is that those schools and kōhanga have gone back to operation as per normal.</p>
<p>Te Ururoa Flavell: What crisis intervention assistance and culturally appropriate trauma counselling will be made available to te kōhanga reo o Tāneatua following the events of 15 October, after its van, full of preschoolers, was stopped three times at three separate roadblocks and reportedly boarded by an armed offenders squad in full combat gear with guns, leaving the children—the tamariki—extremely distressed, some still too afraid to go to kōhanga reo 4 days later because of the fear of the “ninja army”?</p>
<p>Hon STEVE MAHAREY: I think it is really important at this time for cool heads to prevail while we wait to see what will arise from the police investigations. Labelling is probably not the best thing to do at this particular time. I say again that my advice is that police did not board any transport and that children were facilitated through the roadblocks to make sure they moved on their way. In relation to trauma and counselling, the member will be aware that the Ministry of Education moves very swiftly on requests by schools to deal with those issues and to provide counsellors and support. It will do so in this case as soon as it is invited to.</p>
<p>Te Ururoa Flavell: Does the Minister agree with the plan for action in Ka Hikitia that recommends that Government agencies working together is one of five factors that can make the most difference for Māori students; if so, what protocols will he recommend to the New Zealand Police to ensure that children are not subjected to police actions that can cause long-lasting trauma?</p>
<p>Hon STEVE MAHAREY: I repeat that we are waiting for the full details of these operations to emerge; therefore, I do not have them. But I am saying that what I am aware of is that the police appear to have made sure they did not board transport or put themselves in those kinds of situations the member is alluding to. We will have to wait for full details to emerge, but that is my understanding. I hope the member will ensure that the information he gets that he makes available in a public platform is accurate information, because, as I said, at this time I think it is very important that cool heads prevail, that we wait for full details, and that we are accurate in what we say.</p>
<p>Te Ururoa Flavell: I raise a point of order, Madam Speaker. I appreciate the information given by the Minister in his answer, but I ask him, through you, whether it is appropriate to address the question with respect to the concerns coming through the constituency, which were about the work that will be done by the New Zealand Police to ensure that the children are not subjected again to any actions. If he could address that part of the question, it would be helpful.</p>
<p>Madam SPEAKER: I thought the Minister did address the question, but if he wants to add any more, then he is perfectly free to do so.</p>
<p>Hon STEVE MAHAREY: I think it is important to clarify exactly where the question needs to go. If the member wants to know about the police, unfortunately he needs to ask a question of the Minister of Police. But as Minister of Education I say that it is, of course, my interest, and I am making sure that I am being kept up to speed with what is going on around young children in our country and in our schools. As I say, if trauma teams are asked for, they go straight in there to assist. I am assured that the police did not board buses; they treated children properly. It will emerge—and I see that the member is not agreeing with me—if the factors are different from that, but that is what I have sought to do. If the member wants to know precisely about the police, then unfortunately he will need to ask the Minister of Police.</p>
