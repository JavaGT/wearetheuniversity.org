<p>Phil Heatley MP<br>National Party Housing Spokesman</p>
<p>23 October 2007</p>
<p>Vandalism costs still rising rapidly for HNZ</p>
<p>National Party Housing spokesman Phil Heatley says Housing Minister Chris Carter appears to have done nothing to crack down on vandalism at state houses in light of new figures that show damage has risen by a further 10% in the past year.</p>
<p>&quot;In two years the rate of damage and vandalism has now climbed by more than 40%, from $16.5 million to $23.3 million.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Heatley says the HNZ definition of damage does not include fair wear and tear, but damage done by the tenant or third parties.</p>
<p>&quot;And to prove my point, I&#39;m releasing photos of some of the damage being done. It&#39;s clear from these images this is not about fair wear and tear.&quot; (Attached)</p>
<p>Mr Heatley is also releasing answers to parliamentary questions which show the rapid rise in the taxpayer-funded damage bill. They also identify the worst HNZ tenants.</p>
<p>&quot;One current tenant in the West Auckland community of Henderson has run up an $11,762 damage bill, while another in Waitakere has amassed a $10,439 bill.</p>
<p>&quot;What does the Housing Minister say to the 10,000 needy families on the waiting list who are being kept out of a state home because Chris Carter tolerates this sort of damage being done to taxpayer assets.</p>
<p>&quot;And if the Minister is so tough in recovering the costs, why did he allow HNZ to write off $2,478,000 worth of damage debt owed by tenants in this past year?</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister claims the problem lies with a few troublemakers, and the corporation knows who they are, so why does he let them run up debts, then write the debts off, all the while allowing them to remain in their state house?</p>
<p>&quot;For the sake of the many thousands on the HNZ waiting list, Mr Carter needs to sort out his priorities.&quot;</p>
