<p>Education Ministry runs scared in Albany</p>
<p>The refusal of Education Ministry officials to attend a community meeting in Albany over their botched attempts to secure a site for the new Albany Senior High School is nothing short of cowardly, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>When Helen Clark opened Albany Junior High School in 2005 she promised gathered parents that the senior school would be open by 2009.</p>
<p>“This is yet another broken promise.  Despite having a seven-year lead-in, the Ministry’s bureaucratic bungling has seen the building of the senior school delayed by at least one, if not two years.</p>
<p>“This is a huge concern for the students who will eventually graduate from Albany Junior High.  Parents are now worried they’ll have to scramble to find another senior school for their children, who need stability for their senior school years, but currently face uncertainty.</p>
<p>“It is spineless for Ministry officials to refuse to front at Monday’s public meeting. Sure, it is going to be difficult, but these parents deserve to know what answers the Ministry has to fix this mess.</p>
<p>“This cowardly response from the Ministry is insulting to the concerned parents and students who will attend this meeting.</p>
<p>“The Minister should insist that his officials front up, accept they’ve completely bungled the project, and more importantly, explain clearly their solutions to the problem.</p>
<p>“Hiding is not an option”.</p>
