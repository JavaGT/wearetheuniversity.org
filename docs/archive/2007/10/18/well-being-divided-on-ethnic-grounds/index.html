<p>&#39;Well-being divided on ethnic grounds&#39; says Turia Tariana Turia,</p>
<p>Co-leader of the Maori Party</p>
<p>Thursday 18 October 2007</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s latest &#39;Social Report 2007&#39; records more bad news for Maori says Tariana Turia, Co-Leader of the Maori Party.</p>
<p>&quot;The report lists page by page, the ways in which outcomes for Maori are poorer than those for Europeans&quot; said Mrs Turia. &quot;We have a shorter life expectancy, a higher suicide rate, higher smoking and obesity rates, and disproportionately high workplace injury claim rates&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The lows are equally distressing&quot; said Mrs Turia. &quot;The report reveals lower participation rate in early childhood and lower rates of employment&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;While the level of Maori participation in tertiary education remains higher than for other groups, we know it has actually been declining in the last few years as a result of government attacks on wananga&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;To offset such a dismal record, we were relieved to see some very positive outcomes in terms of the increase of numbers of speakers of te reo Maori&quot;.</p>
<p>Income Inequity Destroys Social Cohesion &quot;One of the most disturbing comments in the report was to do with income inequality&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;The report states that &#39;high levels of inequality are associated with lower levels of social cohesion and personal wellbeing, even when less well-off people have adequate incomes to meet their basic needs&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It then describes how in 2004 10.8% of New Zealanders were living in households with incomes below the OECD low income threshold (up from 9.8% in 2000)&quot; said Mrs Turia. &quot;This ten percent is segregated on racial grounds with stark differences between European and Maori, Pasifika and other New Zealanders&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;All that such data does is demonstrate that New Zealand society is being divided on ethnic grounds&quot; said Mrs Turia. &quot;Our nation must respond to the needs and aspirations of all communities, including of course, tangata whenua, the first peoples of our land&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Government back-patting is offensive in the extreme when you assess the stark differences in quality of life that these figures show. I for one cannot claim any sense of satisfaction that unemployment rates for Maori are nearly three times that of Pakeha, that Maori continue to be over-represented in the growing number of poor in New Zealand, or that Maori die earlier than others. We want to see these figures drop dramatically before any back-patting is acceptable&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the most graphic illustrations of the ongoing disparities is the wheel of fortune which shows social wellbeing for Maori relative to Europeans from 2004-2006&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;Out of the 30 indicators, only four recorded the outcome being better for Maori than for Europeans (tertiary education participation; physical activity; cultural and arts activities; and regular contact with family and friends&quot;). In other words, 26 of the 30 indicators reported that outcomes for Maori are worse than for Europeans&quot;.</p>
<p>Background Data</p>
<p>* Workplace injury claim rates for Maori was 182 per 1000 FTEs compared to 119 per 1000 European FTEs;</p>
<p>* Maori early childhood participation is 90% rate compared to 98% for European;</p>
<p>* Maori unemployment rate in 2006 was 7.9% compared to 2.7% for European.</p>
<p>* Low income: in 2004, 12% of European individuals were living in households with incomes below the OECD low income threshold; 22% of Maori, 29% of Pasifika and 38% of other New Zealanders.</p>
<p>* Te reo Maori: there was an increase of 1100 te reo Maori speakers between 2001 and 2006.</p>
