<p>Celebrate Teachers On World Teachers&#39; Day</p>
<p>Celebrate the teachers in your community on World Teachers’ Day on Friday October 26th.</p>
<p>World Teachers’ Day was established by UNESCO and is celebrated in over 100 countries around the world each year.</p>
<p>The country’s largest education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa says it provides an opportunity to draw attention to the important role of teachers in building a better future for each and every learner.</p>
<p>It is also a time to celebrate quality public education and teaching as a profession.</p>
<p>This year, the global education union Education International’s theme for World Teachers’ Day is Quality Teachers for Quality Education. Its World Teachers’ Day campaign focuses on better working conditions for teachers, which means better learning conditions for children. This is particularly appropriate in New Zealand given current teacher bargaining.</p>
<p>NZEI is encouraging schools and worksites to mark the day with activities such as students being “teacher for the day”, or classroom discussions around what makes a good teacher, and the different types of working and learning conditions for teachers and children in other countries.</p>
<p>It has also produced a World Teachers’ Day poster and is hosting a function at parliament at 4pm on October 26th. There will be a photo essay on display featuring a day in the life of a teacher and a number of politicians and education sector groups will be attending.</p>
