<p>Labour botches Albany Senior High plan</p>
<p>Bureaucratic bungling by the Ministry of Education has seen the dreams of Albany Junior High School students and their families shattered, says National&#39;s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>Ministry officials admit that they were &#39;not quick out of the blocks&#39; in securing a site for the new school, and give excuses that consent issues have now delayed the school for at least one year, if not two. They are looking at temporary accommodation for graduating pupils.</p>
<p>&quot;When Helen Clark opened Albany Junior High School in 2005 she promised gathered parents that the senior school would be open by 2009. Parents did not for a minute think that she meant they&#39;d be housed in prefabs or a high-rise commercial building.</p>
<p>&quot;A toxic combination of the Ministry&#39;s poor planning and bumbling ineptitude has resulted in parents being forced to consider uprooting their children to send them to other schools that can provide continuity in the senior years when NCEA is such a major focus.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry cannot blame consent delays. Labour had seven years to build this school - they simply failed to secure the land in time and manage the building project.</p>
<p>&quot;None of the alternative solutions being discussed so far will meet the approval of parents.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand that officials have considered a solution that the Ministry lease and refurbish a commercial building in Albany as an interim measure for students. This is fascinating, given Steve Maharey claimed he&#39;d &#39;die in a ditch&#39; over private ownership of school buildings. The Minister should explain whether this option is still on the table in light of his recent utterances.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a public meeting on this issue next Monday. The Minister&#39;s representatives must turn up to that meeting with some clearly stated solutions and an explanation of what resources the Government is promising to back up any new plan.</p>
<p>&quot;National will be seeking a cast-iron guarantee that the quality of education for these students will not be put at risk by the Ministry&#39;s lack of planning.</p>
<p>&quot;The parents attending that meeting expect and deserve nothing less&quot;.</p>
