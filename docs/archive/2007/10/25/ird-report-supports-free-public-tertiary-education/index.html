<p>IRD Report supports call for free public tertiary education</p>
<p>Students are referring the government to its own recently released Inland Revenue Annual Report for the clear evidence that the student loan scheme is inefficient, inappropriate and has passed its use-by date.</p>
<p>&quot;This report clearly demonstrates the inefficiencies of the student loan scheme and highlights the huge financial challenges facing vast numbers of students and graduates. It is an indictment on a government that has consistently failed to meet the needs of the tertiary community&quot; said Joey Randall, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students&#39; Associations (NZUSA).</p>
<p>Overall the report shows student loan repayments have remained consistent with the previous year, however it highlights that more students are now borrowing more money and that fewer numbers are managing to pay their loans off.</p>
<p>&quot;Increased borrowing backs up student claims that escalating tuition fees and reductions in student allowance eligibility are unfair and un-manageable and are resulting in forced reliance on the loan scheme. New Zealanders are being burdened with huge personal debt due to government inaction in education, and it&#39;s just not good enough&quot;, said Randall.</p>
<p>The student loan scheme provides limited financial assistance to students during study. Until 1 April 2006 student loans incurred significant interest charges, resulting in massive loan balances far beyond the original cost of the study for many students and graduates, the legacy of which many are still battling with today.</p>

<p>&quot;An entire generation are now affected by the failed experiment that is the student loan scheme, and they deserve positive change now&quot;, said Randall.</p>
<p>NZUSA urges the government to take heed of the evidence in the report and address this mess once and for all, proving its commitment to the knowledge economy by adequately support students through study with universal student allowances and fully publicly funded tertiary education.</p>
