<p>Culture and diversity theme timely, says AUT Pro-Vice Chancellor</p>
<p>Migrant, refugee, temporary worker and international student mental health has assumed greater importance as the world’s 6.5 billion people have become increasingly mobile, says AUT University’s Pro-Vice Chancellor, Professor Max Abbott.</p>
<p>This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week focuses on culture and diversity. World Mental Health Day, October 10, was established by the World Federation for Mental Health 15 years ago. Professor Abbott was the federation’s President at the time. “Some countries, including New Zealand, expanded the day to a week of mental health education and related activities. It heightens public awareness about the importance of mental health and aims to gain understanding and improve attitudes about mental disorders.”</p>
<p>The theme of culture and diversity is particularly relevant in this age of migration, he says.</p>
<p>“More than a fifth of people in New Zealand were born elsewhere. In contrast to earlier times when most migrants came from Western Europe, today’s migrants increasingly come from Asia and other parts of the world.</p>
<p>“Historically people seen as racially different and those experiencing serious mental health disorders have been among those most exposed to rejection and persecution. While there have been improvements in this country during the past 20 years, much remains to be done.”</p>
<p>For example, he says, New Zealand Chinese migrant adolescents and young adults are at high risk for mental health problems if one or both parents are absent, as are adults who have absent or satellite spouses.</p>
<p>“The average mental health status of a particular migrant or refugee group may be the same, better or worse than that of the overall population, but there are subgroups at very high risk which make these averages misleading.</p>
<p>“While refugees have typically been exposed to severe trauma prior to reaching New Zealand, numerous studies indicate that factors once here are typically far more important influences on their mental health and wellbeing,” says Professor Abbott. Factors identified include unemployment and underemployment, discrimination, separation from family, community and people of similar cultural background, and language difficulties.</p>
<p>These are being addressed by government, local bodies, employers, community organisations, migrant and refugee organisations and migrants and refugees themselves to varying degrees.</p>
<p>AUT contributes to this through research and offering a range of programmes in the mental health and psychosocial areas.</p>
<p>AUT’s Asian and Migrant Health Research Centre is one of only two such centres in New Zealand that focuses on health, including mental health.</p>
<p>The centre aims to improve the wellbeing of these communities in New Zealand by promoting equity, community development and social justice, says Professor Abbott. Its research is accessible and appropriate for education, policy and practice and for ethnic communities themselves. The research aims to move communities forward rather than merely identifying problems or issues.</p>
<p>AUT is hosting two events for Mental Health Awareness Week, including an evening of speakers and a workshop day for mental health professionals.</p>
