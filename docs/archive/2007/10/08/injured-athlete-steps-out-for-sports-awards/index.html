<p>Injured athlete steps out for sports awards</p>
<p>Attending Massey’s Blues Sports Awards dinner tonight in Auckland will be a rare social outing for top New Zealand sportswoman Anna Hamilton, seriously injured when she was knocked off her cycle during a training ride two months ago.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old Massey student, one of the country’s top multi-sports athletes, suffered serious head injuries and has undergone two major operations to repair damage to her neck, spine, shoulder and collarbone.</p>
<p>Since being hit by a car on 3 August on State Highway 17 near Dairy Flat, she has been taking things very quietly at home as she recovers, says her mother Katy Hamilton.</p>
<p>She has physiotherapy treatment away from home twice a week, and can now walk several hundred metres without a walking frame.</p>
<p>Even reading and watching television make her tired because the head injury has affected her eyesight – something she hopes will gradually improve.</p>
<p>“She’s supposed to stay in a very low stimulus environment, away from tv, cellphones, computers, people and crowds,” says Mrs Hamilton, who has been politely dissuading “hundreds of kind and interested well-wishers” who want to visit Anna. Even a small amount of stimulation could upset her recovery and see her back in hospital.</p>
<p>Mrs Hamilton says staying at home in quiet, bush-clad surroundings has been the best therapy for her daughter.</p>
<p>Wearing a full upper body brace means she cannot sit for long due to the discomfort. “She’s either walking or lying down,” Mrs Hamilton says.</p>
<p>Anna, who is enrolled as a part-time student in a Bachelor of Science degree majoring in human nutrition, says she is happy to be attending the dinner as she had been separated from her sporting life since the accident.</p>
<p>She will begin swimming training in three weeks when her body brace comes off and plans to resume study next year.</p>
<p>Twenty-six athletes of national and international standing will receive Blues awards tonight at the function at University’s Auckland campus and a sportsman and sportswoman of the year will be named.</p>
<p>Tomorrow night a similar function will be held at Palmerston North, where 47 athletes from the Wellington and Palmerston North campuses will receive Blues awards.</p>
