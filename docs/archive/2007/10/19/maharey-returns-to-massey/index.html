<p>Maharey returns to Massey</p>
<p>The Massey University Council today announced the appointment of Hon Steve Maharey as Vice-Chancellor.</p>
<p>Mr Maharey is a Massey graduate and former academic staff member of the University. Current Vice-Chancellor Professor Judith Kinnear will retire from the role in March 2008.</p>
<p>University Chancellor Nigel Gould says the Council is delighted that Mr Maharey has accepted the invitation to take up this role.</p>
<p>Mr Maharey is currently Minister of Education, Minister of Broadcasting, Minister of Research, Science and Technology, Minister for Crown Research Institutes, Minister Responsible for the Education Review Office and Acting Minister for Social Development and Employment.</p>
<p>“As a previous Minister responsible for Tertiary Education, Steve fully appreciates how pivotal universities are to the development of New Zealand as a knowledge-based society,” Mr Gould says. “In recognising that New Zealand’s education and research capacity is a key to the successful transformation of the national economy and catalyst for community change, Steve has had a major responsibility for reforms in the university sector and has developed a clear vision for the contribution that universities must make.</p>
<p>“As the architect of the reforms he is now taking the opportunity to be a major player in their successful implementation.”</p>
<p>Mr Gould says Mr Maharey has an intimate knowledge of challenges facing the tertiary sector and a close understanding of Massey’s unique positioning within it. His academic background in Business and Social Sciences, coupled with his Ministerial responsibilities and his role as the Member of Parliament for Palmerston North for the past 17 years, means he has a broad understanding of the wide spectrum of the University’s activities, says Mr Gould.</p>

<p>Mr Maharey has a BA and an MA (Hons) in sociology. He worked at Massey University between 1978 and 1990 and was a senior lecturer in sociology. He also taught business administration. He has published widely in his specialist areas of interest, media and cultural studies and social change. From 1986-89 he was a Palmerston North City Councillor before entering Parliament in 1990.</p>
<p>Mr Maharey will take up his position next year.</p>
