<p>Terror&#39;s threat<br>Howard&#39;s way for Australia?<br>Worryingly anxious children</p>
<p>IN THE NEWS<br>NCEA put to the test<br>Law Commission&#39;s</p>
<p>TERROR&#39;S THREAT</p>
<p>The arrest of seventeen people in police raids on alleged &#39;training camps&#39;<br>has caused a media storm involving &#39;activists,&#39; &#39;weapons training camps,&#39;<br>&#39;napalm,&#39; &#39;firearms charges,&#39; the Terrorism Suppression Act and general<br>muddle, as we all try to work out what exactly the facts are, and what on<br>earth is going on in the depths of the bush.</p>
<p>Whether or not the &#39;activists&#39; in this particular case were a real threat,<br>over-enthusiastic survivalists, or harmless youth workers doing their<br>knitting, the threat could all too easily be real. It seems a good time to<br>think again about the roots and bulwarks of the common good, to remember<br>those things which hold us together in the midst of threat, danger and<br>disagreement.</p>
<p>Human society is made up of people held together by social glue, and by<br>commonly accepted rules about how we will live together. Most obviously<br>these rules are contained in the rule of law to which we all ought to<br>submit, but also in other voices whose authority we recognise. In a healthy<br>society, we allow and encourage standing grounds for disagreement and<br>dissent: trade unions, lobby groups, churches, associations and even<br>families, can serve as places from which to uphold values, speak our piece,<br>and talk to the wider society about what is on our mind. This is how a<br>healthy democracy works; it allows safety valves for the expression of<br>dissent and frustration, and for a process of public dialogue and moral<br>persuasion on the basis of a commonly understood social ethic.</p>

<p>It is this understanding of freedom, order and democratic government which<br>is attacked by the threat of terror. Abandoning the way we do things, and<br>the accepted ways of expressing legitimate dissent in favour of violence is<br>thus not only a threat to freedom, but to the very existence of ordered<br>society itself. Whether or not there was a real threat this time, we are<br>reminded that the safety and security of our whole society depends not only<br>on the Police, but also on the rest of us. We must work together to build<br>and to foster a healthy body politic, with the strong social bonds we<br>cannot afford to neglect.</p>
<p>HOWARD&#39;S WAY FOR AUSTRALIA?</p>
<p>John Howard has at last announced that the Australian federal election will<br>be on 24 November. On this day, Australians must decide whether to return<br>Howard&#39;s Coalition Government to office. Howard, who has been Prime<br>Minister since 1996, faces opposition from a resurgent Australian Labor<br>Party (ALP), and its leader, Kevin Rudd, promises to bring &#39;new leadership&#39;<br>to Australia. The closer Australia gets to the election, the more that the<br>age-old philosophical divide between the two main parties emerges, with one<br>party offering hands-on &#39;national leadership&#39; and the other more<br>flexibility and freedom to the people.</p>
<p>Kevin Rudd&#39;s response to the announcement of the election was to claim that<br>the current Government was out of touch on issues like climate change,<br>healthcare and labour laws which allow employers to negotiate more flexible<br>contracts with workers. He is pledging that under him the federal<br>government would expand its role, with various national strategies and<br>programmes. Howard, by contrast, proposes to lead the country in a way<br>which gives incentives for people to work and prosper while also promising<br>leadership that will foster the national good. Howard, and Treasurer Peter<br>Costello, have announced a wide-ranging set of tax cuts, which would<br>deliver around A$20 (NZ$24) per week to a person on average earnings from 1<br>July 2008.</p>
<p>While the ALP is ahead in the polls by as much as eighteen points, Howard<br>has history on his side. Even Rudd has conceded that to win this election<br>means his party will &#39;have to make history.&#39; The ALP has only won twice<br>from opposition since World War II and it is generally unusual for<br>incumbent governments to lose when the economy is in good shape, although<br>sometimes voters simply tire of a government.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, with debate revived during the last month about the role of<br>government in delivering public services such as education and healthcare,<br>the differences are also becoming more apparent between the National Party,<br>aspiring to become the Government, and the incumbent Labour-led Government.<br>For voters in both countries the sharper differentiation shows precisely<br>the presuppositions which lie behind the rhetoric of each party: either a<br>stronger hand for government, with either Labour Party, but perhaps at the<br>expense of the freedom to prosper on one&#39;s own terms, which is being<br>offered by the Coalition and the National Party. But in Australia-no matter<br>how one looks at it-both Howard and Rudd will need to work hard to convince<br>voters that theirs is the best way forward.</p>
<p>WORRYINGLY ANXIOUS CHILDREN</p>
<p>A report released this week in the UK highlights some alarming trends in<br>schools and communities. Community Soundings, a report from the Primary<br>Review, has found a consensus across various communities and schools that<br>children&#39;s behaviour, their anxiety about the future and parents&#39; lack of<br>responsibility for their children need attention.</p>
<p>The Primary Review is a broad project, based at the University of<br>Cambridge, established to consider primary education and related social<br>factors. It aims to assess various factors within primary schools,<br>including education and curriculum, culture, society and the global<br>context, values and principles, parenting and children&#39;s lives outside of<br>school. Community Soundings is the first part of this review. The<br>information contained in the report comes from interviews in nine different<br>regions of England, with a total of 757 people, including parents,<br>teachers, local authorities, police, heads of schools and primary-aged<br>children.</p>
<p>According to the report, children are struggling to adapt to a changing<br>culture, and have a high degree of anxiety about social factors such as<br>gangs, weapons and street violence, and international events such as<br>climate change and global inequality. They also fear for their personal<br>safety outside of school. The teachers interviewed were concerned about the<br>pervasive and often inappropriate influence of media and technology on<br>children and increasing marital breakdown and family instability. Teachers<br>and community representatives were also concerned about parents failing to<br>teach basic principles of good behaviour or mutual respect for others. Many<br>teachers also felt children were growing up socially isolated, both within<br>their families and across generations.</p>
<p>With increasing social disconnection it is hardly surprising that children<br>are feeling fearful and isolated. The increasing importance of television<br>must contribute to this directly by communicating to children a picture of<br>threats in the world and indirectly by its presence as a substitute for<br>family relationships. Parents need to consider their levels of involvement<br>with their children, alongside the impact of letting children have<br>unfettered use of technology. The anxiety children feel about the world<br>around them should remind us that we are responsible for the way our<br>society develops. While it would be easy to become pessimistic about the<br>report&#39;s findings, the best response is to learn from them and act early.</p>

<p>NCEA PUT TO THE TEST</p>
<p>The New Zealand Council for Education Research released a report yesterday,<br>showing that while 89 percent of school principals and 60 percent of<br>teachers support NCEA, there are &#39;high levels of uncertainty among<br>parents.&#39; Taking the pulse of NCEA, which analyses data gathered in late<br>2006, suggests that parents and teachers who are unhappy with NCEA are more<br>likely to be unhappy with other aspects of the school as well, such as a<br>lack of support for a teacher, or insufficient communication between a<br>parent and the school. Rosemary Hipkins, author of the report, suggests<br>that NCEA is being used as a &#39;lightning rod&#39; for a broader dissatisfaction<br>about secondary school education, and in fact there was &#39;very little<br>desire&#39; amongst those interviewed to return to the previous education<br>system.</p>

<p>LAW COMMISSION&#39;S NEW WORK PROGRAMME</p>
<p>The Law Commission has released its work programme for next year. As well<br>as completing existing work, the Commission will begin new projects,<br>including reviews of the Misuse of Drugs Act, the assault provisions of the<br>Crimes Act and &#39;the law relating to private schools.&#39; The Commission will<br>also look at reforms to criminal procedure and &#39;reducing the level and<br>impact of organised crime in New Zealand.&#39;</p>
<p>The Law Commission is an independent body &#39;which reviews areas of the law<br>that need updating, reforming or developing,&#39; and makes recommendations to<br>Parliament. In the process, it provides opportunities for interested people<br>to make submissions on its work. The Commission deals with important issues<br>that affect many New Zealanders. Members of the public should take<br>advantage of opportunities to make submissions when they arise.</p>
