<p>Students positive about new VC</p>
<p>Massey University students today reacted enthusiastically to the announcement that the top job at Massey has gone to the Honourable Steve Maharey.</p>
<p>“Steve Maharey is such a timely appointment for staff and students at Massey,” said Liz Hawes, President of the Extramural Students’ Society.</p>
<p>“He brings strong academic leadership to the Massey community together with his outstanding people skills. I am thrilled that we have a Social Scientist to lead the university and especially someone who has intimate knowledge of the extramural strength of the university. Steve has already labelled extramural as the ‘campus of opportunity’. I totally agree with that concept and feel sure that, with Steve’s passion for a well-educated New Zealand, he will use the extramural mode as a vehicle to achieve that goal. I really look forward to working alongside our new Vice-Chancellor.”</p>
<p>Steve has long association with Massey University both as a former lecturer and in his capacity as Palmerston North MP and Education Minister.</p>
<p>Massey University Students’ Association President Paul Falloon says Council’s decision to offer Mr Maharey the role was a wise one.</p>
<p>“I’m excited that Steve is stepping in at a time when Massey needs a strong leader and someone who is willing to act in the interest of students, staff and other stakeholders. He understands the University’s role in New Zealand and the potential for Massey to improve its world-wide recognition,” says Falloon. “I think Steve has already demonstrated that he has a genuine passion for Massey, and I’m hopeful this passion will mean a Vice Chancellor who will prioritise student welfare and world-class education and research above purely commercial considerations”</p>
