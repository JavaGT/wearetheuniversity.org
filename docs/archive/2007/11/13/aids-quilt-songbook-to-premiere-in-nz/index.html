<p><strong>Tuesday, 13 November 2007, 4:14 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Internationally acclaimed AIDS Quilt Songbook to premiere in New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>The <em>AIDS Quilt Songbook</em>, one of the most historically significant classical works to come from late twentieth century American music, will premiere in New Zealand on 16 November.</p>
<p>Performed by New Zealand School of Music Masters student Hadleigh Adams, the youngest ever male singer to occupy a place as a PWC Dame Malvina Major Emerging Artist with the New Zealand Opera, and accompanied by renowned pianist Bruce Greenfield, the <em>AIDS Quilt Songbook</em> is a composition of 18 poems written by eminent American poets on the subject of AIDS, set to music by eighteen of America’s top composers.</p>
<p>Professor Elizabeth Hudson, Director of the School of Music said the resultant work is a monumental song cycle for baritone voice and piano, one of the most important musical responses to the AIDS epidemic.</p>
<p>“The range and depth of musical styles encompassed by the songs marks the set as one of the most significant representations of recent American composition,” she said.</p>
<p>“The work has been performed internationally by some of the world&#39;s top artists and has raised thousands upon thousands of dollars for AIDS research. In a time when new compositions often struggle to find an audience, the 1992 American premiere brought the audience to its feet. It has effectively provoked controversy, conflict, discussion and praise.”</p>
<p>Professor Hudson said that the opportunity to perform a premiere is a privilege that few singers are afforded, but Hadleigh has dedicated himself to achieving above and beyond the status quo.</p>
<p>“Hadleigh has worked hard to focus on dramatic interpretation in both the operatic and recital fields alike,” she said. “It is a bold and exciting move to bring this work to New Zealand audiences.”</p>
<p>The <em>AIDS Quilt Songbook</em> will premiere on 16 November at St Andrews on the Terrace, Wellington with a full season to follow early in the New Year, including seasons in both Auckland and Christchurch. Entry is free with donations gratefully received at the conclusion of the performance.</p>
<p>Already confirmed to be in attendance are the Right Honourable Chris Carter, Her Worship the Mayor Kerry Prendergast, and Charles Chauval MP.</p>
<p>In lieu of a performance fee, Hadleigh will be donating all proceeds from this concert to the New Zealand AIDS Foundation.</p>
