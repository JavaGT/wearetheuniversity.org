<p><strong>New book opens the wardrobe on New Zealand clothing</strong></p>
<p>A fresh look at the role of clothes in New Zealand history proves that clothing reveals as much as it conceals, says a cultural researcher.</p>
<p>Studying clothes and how they are worn provides a pathway into our history and culture, says co-editor Dr Bronwyn Labrum, a senior lecturer at the School of Visual and Material Culture.</p>
<p>“Despite a reputation for being wary of “looking flash”, New Zealanders have not always been dowdy dressers,” says Dr Labrum.</p>
<p><em>Looking Flash, Clothing In Aotearoa New Zealand</em> examines what we wear and what we have worn – from shrinking swimming togs to the black singlet – over the past three centuries.</p>
<p>It is the first edited collection on clothing in New Zealand history and brings together a range of writers, both academics and those in museums and other institutions, to talk about a broad and surprising range of topics.</p>
<p>Dr Labrum says the book is full of unexpected stories.</p>
<p>“The shearer’s wool singlet was originally a simple work garment, but was later adopted by cartoonists as shorthand for the good Kiwi bloke. Fred Dagg made it an icon in the 1970s; then women in the 1980s turned it into a fashion item. It now appears in gay nightclubs as dancewear.”</p>
<p>The richly-illustrated essays span the clothing of pre-colonial Maori society, marching girls and castaways, and include 18th-century heirloom dresses, hand-me-downs, and wartime garb. There are also extraordinary stories about the fate of a Maori cloak and an Otago farmer&#39;s remarkable collection of 1970s high-fashion garments.</p>

<p>The book, published by Auckland University Press, will be launched at 5.30pm on Thursday (15 November) in Massey’s Museum Building foyer, Buckle St, Wellington.</p>
<p>The School of Visual and Material Culture, part of the College of Creative Arts, is a centre of teaching and research excellence that seeks to develop new perspectives between people and things in the images and objects that shape everyday life.</p>
