<p>Turia Questions Ellis&#39;s Publicity Stunt</p>
<p>What is the difference between a wananga in the Ureweras and a &quot;Covert Guerilla Operation&#39; at Rangitoto for fun?</p>
<p>asks Tariana Turia</p>
<p>Environment Spokesperson for the Maori Party</p>
<p>Questions have been asked about a &quot;covert operation&quot; involving explosives, targeting Te Rangi-i-totongia-ai-te-ihu-o-Tamatekapua, the largest and most recent volcano in the Auckland Volcanic field.</p>
<p>&quot;It interests me how everyone is so quick to laugh this bizarre act off as a &#39;publicity stunt&#39; while for the last month the nation has been paralyzed with fear from the impact of &#39;Operation Eight&#39; - a covert operation alleging &#39;para-military training camps&#39; were held in the Urewera Valley&quot; said Tariana Turia, environment spokesperson for the Maori Party.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s press release from director Marc Ellis&#39; even went as far as to describe the simulated eruption as part of a &quot;guerrilla marketing stunt&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;Rangitoto is a unique natural environment - distinctive not only as a volcanic landform, but because it holds the largest remaining pohutukawa forest in Aotearoa; as well as more than two hundred species of native trees and flowering plants, over forty types of ferns, orchids, and a home for many thousands of black-back gulls&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;While I can appreciate the immediate feedback shows that people love a good gimmick, I have to question the impact of the explosive eruptions and the dramatic clouds of white smoke that appeared to be covering the island&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>

<p>&quot;I can&#39;t help but think about Maunga Ruapehu, and what we, as Whanganui iwi, would think about such a prank happening on our ancestral mountain&quot; said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;d be interested to know what the tangata whenua, Nga Tai and Ngati Paoa, thought about this guerrilla marketing stunt&quot; said Mrs Turia. &quot;Who gave the authority and the legal permission for Rangitoto Island to be treated in this way?&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;While everyone loves a good joke, I&#39;d like to know how funny the Department of Conservation, Police, Emergency Services, and mana whenua of Rangitoto thought the early morning eruption really was&quot; ended Mrs Turia.</p>
