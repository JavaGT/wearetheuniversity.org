<p><strong>Friday, 16 November 2007, 1:52 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>NZUSA elects student leaders for 2008</p>
<p>The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) has elected its national officers for 2008. Liz Hawes and Paul Falloon will be the Co-Presidents of NZUSA and Analiese Jackson will be the NZUSA National Women’s Rights Officer.</p>
<p>“I am really excited about the potential for the student movement to achieve positive change both in the lead up to, and following, the general election in 2008,” said Paul Falloon, Co-President elect of NZUSA. Paul Falloon is currently the President of the Massey University Students’ Association (MUSA) and a Science graduate from Massey University.</p>
<p>“As long as students are forced to borrow to live and tuition fees keep going up, we have plenty of work to do. Next year we will be campaigning hard for a living allowance for all students and lower fees,” said Liz Hawes, Co-President elect of NZUSA. Liz Hawes is the current President of the Massey University Extra Mural Students’ Association (EXMSS) and is mid way through a PhD in Political Science.</p>
<p>“While women students continue to face difficulties in non-traditional areas, and face a significant gender pay gap upon graduation, there is an ongoing need for women’s representation. I look forward to working to address these and other issues facing women in 2008,” said Analiese Jackson, NZUSA National Women’s Rights Officer elect. Analiese Jackson is currently Women’s Affairs Officer on the Massey Albany Students’ Association (ASA) executive, has recently completed a Bachelor of Communications and will study at Victoria University in 2008.</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929. Current Co-Presidents Joey Randall and Josh Clark will continue in their roles until the end of the year.</p>
