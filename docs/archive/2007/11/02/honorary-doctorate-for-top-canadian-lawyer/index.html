<p>Honorary doctorate for top Canadian lawyer</p>
<p>Emeritus Professor David Mullan, a highly distinguished lawyer in Canada and Victoria University alumnus, is being awarded an honorary doctorate from his alma mater.</p>
<p>&quot;We are delighted to be able to recognise David Mullan, a Victoria graduate who has maintained his connection with the University. It is highly satisfying to have the opportunity to acknowledge those who have made a difference in their chosen profession, and David Mullan’s contribution to Commonwealth administrative law and to the teaching of law is a prime example,&quot; said Victoria University Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh.</p>
<p>Professor Mullan graduated with a Bachelor of Laws from Victoria University in 1968, followed by a Master of Laws with first-class honours in 1970. He was admitted to the Supreme Court of New Zealand as a Barrister and Solicitor in 1969.</p>
<p>A Junior Lecturer at Victoria from 1968-70, he left New Zealand in 1970 to undertake further postgraduate work at Queen&#39;s University in Kingston, Ontario.</p>
<p>Victoria&#39;s honorary doctorate is the latest accolade for the high achieving legal academic. He was awarded the Canadian Association of Law Teachers’ Academic Excellence Award in 1996 and an Honorary LL.D. by the Law Society of Upper Canada for his contributions to legal education and continuing legal education for judges and practitioners. He held a named chair at Queen&#39;s University from 1998 to 2003, and has received awards from that University for distinguished teaching and research. In April-May 2001, he returned to Victoria as a Chapman-Tripp Fellow.</p>
<p>He retired in 2003, becoming an Emeritus Professor, and in 2004 was appointed as Toronto’s first Integrity Commissioner. He continues his involvement in administrative law as a part-time tribunal member, consultant, and instructor in professional development programmes.</p>
<p>It is hoped that Professor Mullan will be able to attend a graduation ceremony in December 2008.</p>
