He has made a substantial contribution to the University in his eight years as a councillor and Chair of the Audit Committee.</p>
<p>&quot;He has a strong desire to see this University advance, and for this support we thank him. It is our privilege to to honour him with a Hunter Fellowship.&quot;</p>
