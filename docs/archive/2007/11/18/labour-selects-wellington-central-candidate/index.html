<p>Labour Selects Wellington Central Candidate</p>
<p>The Labour Party today selected Grant Robertson as its candidate for the Wellington Central electorate at next years election. Mr Robertson’s candidacy was endorsed at a meeting of around 100 Labour members and supporters.</p>
<p>Jeremy Greenbrook-Held, Deputy Chair of the Wellington Central Labour Electorate Committee said that the endorsement of Mr Robertson was resounding. &quot;We are thrilled to have selected Grant as our candidate, and will now focus on the campaign ahead and retaining Wellington Central for<br>Labour.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Robertson, 36, is a former public servant and diplomat, student leader and Prime Ministerial advisor. He currently works in Wellington as a research and business manager for Otago University.</p>
<p>“I am grateful for the support that the electorate organisation and the wider party has shown me by selecting me today. Wellington has thrived under a Labour led government, and I am really looking forward to promoting our vision for a sustainable future for our city and country”, Mr Robertson said.</p>
<p>“I love Wellington. It is the city I chose to move to twelve years ago, and it is where I have established my roots. My skills and experience will, if elected, allow me to be a strong advocate for the people of this electorate”, Mr Robertson said.</p>
<p>Mr Robertson paid tribute to Wellington Central MP Marian Hobbs, who will retire at the next election. “Marian has built a remarkable connection with the diverse communities of Wellington Central. Her passion, energy and commitment have been unstinting. I want to continue and build on Marian’s work across the electorate”.</p>
