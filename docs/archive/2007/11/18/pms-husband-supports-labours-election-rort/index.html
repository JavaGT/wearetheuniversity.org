<p>PM’s husband supports Labour’s election rort</p>
<p>Helen Clark’s husband might have to agree with her latest election rort, but thousands of New Zealanders are sickened at the prospect of laws that will severely restrict political opinion yet let Labour spend up large with their money, says National Deputy Leader Bill English.</p>
<p>Mr English is commenting on a letter to the editor in yesterday’s Herald by Helen Clark’s husband, Peter Davis, which accuses the newspaper of opposing Labour’s Electoral Finance Bill for commercial reasons.</p>
<p>“As well as shooting the messenger, the letter goes on to defend this draconian legislation which was the subject of a large protest in Auckland yesterday.</p>
<p>“Professor Davis supports Labour’s grab for tens of millions of taxpayer money to win the election at the same time as heavily restricting anyone else who wants to take part in politics.</p>
<p>“It is the Labour Government which will be able to purchase advertising on a massive scale to push its policies. Yet anyone who wants to run a cake stall is treated with suspicion and hemmed in with new and complicated rules.</p>
<p>“Most New Zealanders are utterly sick of being told how to think.</p>
<p>“Now they are being told they can&#39;t criticise the Labour Government in election year, and have to submit to ridiculous regulations that cover an outrageous one year in every three.</p>
<p>“Professor Davis clearly shares Labour’s suspicion of any dollar that isn&#39;t a taxpayer dollar, and Labour’s inability to handle any criticism.</p>
<p>“The letter shows the whole Clark household is out of touch.”</p>
