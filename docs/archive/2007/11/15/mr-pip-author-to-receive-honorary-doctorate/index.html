<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>15 November 2007</p>
<p><strong><em>Mr Pip</em> author to receive honorary doctorate</strong></p>
<p>One of Victoria University’s best-known graduates – author Lloyd Jones – is to receive an Honorary Doctorate for his contribution to literature.</p>
<p>Mr Jones completed his BA studies at Victoria in 1976 before working as a journalist, consultant and writer.</p>
<p>Crowning his literary achievements over a number of years, his most recent work <em>Mister Pip</em> was awarded the Commonwealth Writers’ Prize Overall Best Book Award 2007, the Montana Medal for Fiction or Poetry, and Readers’ Choice 2007, and was on the final shortlist – as well as bookies’ favourite – for the 2007 Man Booker Prize.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh, says Mr Jones has taken New Zealand literature to new heights, both here and internationally and will inevitably take it further still.</p>
<p>“Lloyd has established himself on a global stage, bringing positive attention to all New Zealand writing.”</p>
<p>Mr Jones’ writing career has produced an important body of work, including numerous articles, short stories and editing work. His bibliography includes <em>Gilmour’s Dairy</em> (1985), <em>Splinter</em> (1988), <em>Swimming to Australia</em> (1991), <em>Into the Field of Play: New Zealand Writers on the Theme of Sport</em> (1992), <em>Last Saturday</em> (1994), <em>Biografi</em> (1993), <em>This House has Three Walls</em> (1997) and <em>Choo Woo</em> (1998). <em>The Book of Fame,</em> published in 2000 and currently being made into a film, won the Deutz Medal for Fiction in 2001 and the Tasmania Pacific Fiction Prize in 2003, when it was also presented as a stage play at Downstage Theatre in Wellington.</p>

<p>These works were followed by a further series of award nominated or winning writings, including <em>Here at the End of the World We Learn to Dance</em> (2002), shortlisted in the 2002 Montana New Zealand Book Awards; <em>Napoleon and the Chicken Farmer</em> (2003), Honour Award, New Zealand Post Book Awards for Children and Young Adults; <em>Paint Your Wife</em> (2004), Commended Title of the 2005 Commonwealth Writers’ Prize for South East Asia and South Pacific Region; and <em>Everything You Need To Know About The World By Simon Eliot</em> (2004), finalist in the non-fiction category of the New Zealand Post Book Awards for Children and Young Adults.</p>
<p>Mr Jones has contributed more widely to New Zealand literature through his establishment of the Four Winds Press, a publishing house which aims to encourage and develop creative non-fiction, to revive the essay as a literary form, and to facilitate publication by New Zealand writers who work in the non-fiction/essay field.</p>
<p>Professor Walsh says Mr Jones has an ongoing and supportive connection with Victoria University, visiting the International Institute of Modern Letters workshops as a guest writer, and taking part in the Are Angels OK? art-science collaboration. Victoria University Press had published a number of his books, including the novel <em>Choo Woo</em> and his breakthrough short story collection, <em>Swimming to Australia</em>.</p>
<p>He was a Katherine Mansfield Fellow in 1989, and has recently taken up the Creative New Zealand Berlin Writers’ Residency.</p>
<p>His Honorary Doctorate in Literature will be conferred in 2008.</p>
