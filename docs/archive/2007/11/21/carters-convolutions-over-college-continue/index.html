<p>Katherine Rich MP<br>National Party Education Spokeswoman</p>

<p>Carter&#39;s convolutions over college continue</p>
<p>Education Minister Chris Carter has changed his story yet again about his Ministry&#39;s inaction over serious sexual abuse allegations against the principal of Hato Paora College, says National&#39;s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Carter has continued to maintain in Parliament since last week, and was still maintaining for a short while today, that the first the Ministry of Education knew about the abuse allegations was August 3 when it was notified by the school.</p>
<p>&quot;Today, mid-question, he accepted that this was not correct and that the date was actually two days earlier when the media contacted the Ministry&#39;s communications unit - a call which gave the Ministry a clear heads-up on the serious issues facing the school.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry could have become involved at that stage, but did nothing with the information, and just passively waited for the school to make a formal notification some days later.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not the kind of response the public expects from the Ministry of Education and it flies in the face of the Minister&#39;s assurance that the number one priority for in these cases is to &#39;seek immediate assurance that the students of the school are safe&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;If that&#39;s the case, why didn&#39;t someone from the Ministry pick up the phone and talk to the school immediately, instead of meekly waiting for the school to call two days later?</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister continues to dismiss the media&#39;s role in first alerting the police and the Ministry to this case, but most would agree that that&#39;s not the way the system should run. &quot;</p>
