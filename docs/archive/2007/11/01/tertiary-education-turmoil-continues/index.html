<p>Paul Hutchison MP<br>National Party Tertiary Education Spokesman</p>
<p>1 November 2007</p>
<p>Tertiary education turmoil continues</p>
<p>The appointment of Pete Hodgson as Minister of Tertiary Education is the last thing the troubled sector needs, says National’s Tertiary Education spokesman, Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>“Tertiary education is in turmoil and needs stability, not another change.</p>
<p>“Not only is the Chief Executive of TEC, Janice Shiner, due to leave for the UK next year, but the chairman Russell Marshall, has been replaced by David Shand. And now there is a new Minister.</p>
<p>“When major restructuring occurs, someone should see the reforms through and be held accountable.</p>
<p>“Labour has presided over wastage calculated at $1 billion. The scandalous squandering of taxpayer money on soft courses and restructuring to the tune of $400 million should have been money spent on teaching.</p>
<p>“In the OECD’s January report it’s revealed that the tertiary sector has undergone change every two years on average.</p>
<p>“The so-called Education (Tertiary Reforms) Amendment Bill will have its second reading when Parliament resumes next week. Labour wants it rushed through before Christmas to validate the ‘investment plans’ each institution has to agree on.</p>
<p>“Pete Hodgson’s appointment will be the third major leadership change in 12 months and typifies the mess they are making in tertiary education at a time when the sector needs to be settled and simplified.</p>
<p>“Janice Shiner is off, Russell Marshall is off, Steve Maharey is gone, and Michael Cullen is also out of the picture.</p>
<p>“The tertiary sector will quite rightly feel abandoned in the hour of its greatest need.”</p>
