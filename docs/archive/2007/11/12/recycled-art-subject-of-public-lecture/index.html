<p><strong>Recycled art subject of public lecture</strong></p>
<p>In the hands of artists, even decommissioned guns can be the raw material for a work of art, says a researcher interested in the anthropology of art.</p>
<p>With increased interest in sustainability, recycled art is the focus of a lecture on Thursday at Massey’s Wellington campus.</p>
<p>Dr Patrick Laviolette, a senior lecturer at the School of Visual and Material Culture, says a Holden car made from corrugated iron and a cow made from corned beef cans are other examples of recycled art.</p>
<p>“New Zealand artist Michael Tuffery’s sculpture <em>Pisupo Lua Afe</em> (Corned Beef, 2000) reminds us<br>that New Zealand grocery exporters sent mixed blessings when they shipped fatty foods to Pacific islands,” Dr Laviolette says.</p>
<p>“My presentation challenges superficial views of ‘recyclia’ (or recycled art) and examines more conceptual, holistic perspectives. What does recycled art tell us about our society and the things we use and consume?</p>
<p>“Seemingly un-aesthetic things associated with violence and waste can be transformed into creative messages that are both artistically beautiful and political.”</p>
<p>The School of Visual and Material Culture, part of the College of Creative Arts, is a centre of teaching and research excellence that seeks to develop new perspectives between people and things in the images and objects that shape everyday life. It offers a Postgraduate Diploma in Visual and Material Culture, Master of Arts, Master of Philosophy and Doctorate of Philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>What: Public lecture – A Recycled Art World For The Second Life Of Things<br>When: Thursday 15 November, 4pm<br>Where: Museum Building Theatrette, Massey University, Buckle St, Wellington<br>Free entry.</strong></p>
