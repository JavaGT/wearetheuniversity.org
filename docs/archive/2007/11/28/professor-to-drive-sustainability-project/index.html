<p>Media Release<br>28 November 2007</p>
<p>Tourism Professor to Drive Australian Sustainability Project</p>
<p>One of New Zealand’s most senior tourism academics has been appointed to head a national sustainability research project in Australia.</p>
<p>David Simmons, Professor of Tourism at Lincoln University, has accepted the position of Director in the Sustainable Tourism Cooperative Research Centre (ST-CRC). He will retain his position at Lincoln University on a part time basis in order to continue a research programme for the New Zealand tourism industry, funded by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology. The programme builds on previous work on tourism yield and examines the spatial dimensions of tourism yield through an analysis of tourist itineraries and expenditure.</p>
<p>The ST-CRC is Australia’s only tourism research and development institute. Professor Simmons will have the challenge of securing research funding and driving innovation in a sector that yields $58billion in tourism revenue annually. He will take up the new position in January 2008.</p>
<p>Dr Stefanie Rixecker, head of Lincoln University’s Environment, Society and Design Division, says the appointment underlines the significance of Prof. Simmons’ work and research record over 30 years.</p>
<p>“The Division and the University will certainly miss his full-time presence on campus, but we look forward to having him here for the FRST programme and in his new capacity.”</p>
<p>Lincoln University’s research commitment to the tourism sector will also be carried forward by another internationally recognised tourism specialist, Associate Professor Susanne Becken.</p>

<p>“Dr Becken is already a big part of our tourism team and is continuing to make her mark in the areas of tourism, climate change and global change,” says Dr Rixecker. “She has recently been a contributor to the International Panel on Climate Change, which was the organisational recipient of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, and is to attend the UN Bali Global Climate Summit as guest scientist to the World Tourism Organisation. I am certain she will continue to show leadership nationally and internationally.”</p>
