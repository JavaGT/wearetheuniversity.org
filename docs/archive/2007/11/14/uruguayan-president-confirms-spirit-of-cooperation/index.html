<p>Uruguayan President confirms spirit of cooperation in education and research</p>
<p>Future cooperation in agricultural education and research between Lincoln University and Uruguay was backed today (13 Nov.) with expressions of goodwill by Uruguayan President Dr Tabare Vazquez.</p>
<p>The President made a three-hour visit to Lincoln University - his only official South Island port of call, during a three day visit to New Zealand which began on Sunday.</p>
<p>This is the first visit by a Uruguayan President and it reciprocates one made to Uruguay six years ago by Prime Minister Helen Clark.</p>
<p>Lincoln University has a long history of research and consultancy associations with Uruguay and these are seen as the basis for future developments.</p>
<p>At the Lincoln University Dairy Farm the President heard about the development of the nitrification inhibitor eco-n and in presentations on the campus he was told about research developments in gene marker technology for foot rot in sheep; trade policy matters and education and training. Representatives from AgResearch and PGG Wrightson also described their companies´ capabilities and areas of expertise.</p>
<p>After lunching on the campus the President then visited a bio-protection technologies research facility, the Biotron.</p>
<p>The President, a doctor and oncology specialist by profession, said medicine and politics shared three principles - &quot;believing in people; working with people; and working for people&quot;.</p>
<p>The transition from doctor to politician was not as strange as many might think, he said, because &quot;politics with a capital `P´ is really all about relationships&quot;.</p>

<p>Impressed with Lincoln University´s well established record of contributions to Uruguay´s agrarian economy and the future prospects in education and research outlined to him in the campus presentations, he assured Vice- Chancellor Professor Roger Field that the University had a &quot;true friend&quot; in Uruguay and he hoped they could work together to &quot;improve the quality of life of our two countries&quot;.</p>
<p>Among officials accompanying the President on his Lincoln University visit was Uruguay´s Minister of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, Jose Mujica. He said Uruguay was a very small country and had to be selective in choosing its cooperative partners, but if external policy paved the way then Lincoln University and New Zealand would be selected, &quot;no doubt about it&quot;.</p>
