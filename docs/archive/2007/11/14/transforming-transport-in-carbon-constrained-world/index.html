<p>Transforming transport in a carbon-constrained world</p>
<p>Our dependence on carbon-intensive transport systems, and what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint when moving people and goods, is the subject of a symposium hosted by the University’s Institute of Policy Studies, School of Government and School of Geography, Environment and Earth Sciences today (14 November).</p>
<p>Transport accounts for more than 40 per cent of New Zealand’s CO2 emissions and has seen the fastest sector growth in emissions since 1990. Only recently, however, has it had the focus it requires in a carbon-constrained world.</p>
<p>Professor Jonathan Boston of the Institute of Policy Studies, editor of the soon-to-be published book, Towards a New Global Climate Treaty: Looking Beyond 2012, says the symposium is the first of two that will hosted by the University on issues relating to transport and climate change.</p>
<p>“The aim of the first symposium is to initiate a dialogue about reframing our dependence on carbon-intensive transport systems. We need to begin to identify how we can transform transport to enable the building of a more resilient and thus sustainable economy, society and environment,” he says.</p>
<p>The symposium will feature leading New Zealand and international speakers from the transport sector and policy community and will cover the New Zealand context, what is happening internationally, and options for change.</p>
<p>The symposium will be held at Victoria University’s Rutherford House Lecture Theatre One from 8.50am.</p>
