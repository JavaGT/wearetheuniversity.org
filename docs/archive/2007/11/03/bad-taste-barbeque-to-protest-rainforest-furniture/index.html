<p>Bad-taste barbeque to protest rainforest furniture</p>
<p>Green Media Release   3rd November 2007</p>
<p>The Green Party is holding a ‘bloody bad taste’ fancy-dress barbeque this morning outside Bigsave Furniture, Tory Street, Wellington, to draw attention to the sale of suspect kwila furniture at the giant furniture store.</p>
<p>“It’s bloody bad taste to sell furniture made from ‘blood timber’ extracted from the rainforests of Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, and that’s why we’re having a ‘bloody bad taste barbeque’ outside stores that sell this furniture,” says Dr Russel Norman, Green Party Co-leader.</p>
<p>“Nearly all of New Zealand’s kwila imports come from the dwindling rainforests of Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. The New Zealand Government and the World Bank have both produced reports showing that most of the logging in these two countries is illegal.</p>
<p>“Despite repeated enquires, management at Bigsave Furniture have refused to confirm that their kwila furniture either comes from plantations or is certified recycled timber.</p>
<p>Green Co-leader Russel Norman will be giving away vegetarian sausages, setting up picnic tables and encouraging the public to support New Zealand manufacturers using sustainable sources such as macrocarpa and to choose Forest Stewardship Council certified timber.</p>
<p>“The Green Party is campaigning against the soaring imports of kwila into New Zealand. Kwila imports are increasing despite Forestry Minister Jim Anderton admitting that illegal logging overseas costs our forestry industry $266 million annually in lost revenue.</p>

<p>“These rainforests that are being illegally logged for kwila have some of the most beautiful and rarest animals in the world, such as 38 bird of paradise species and the world’s largest butterfly, the Queen Alexandra’s birdwing.</p>
<p>“And rainforest destruction is the single biggest contributor to greenhouse emissions, responsible for 20% of all emissions globally.</p>
<p>“We call on Bigsave to ensure that their wooden furniture is sourced from certified sustainable and legal sources.”</p>
