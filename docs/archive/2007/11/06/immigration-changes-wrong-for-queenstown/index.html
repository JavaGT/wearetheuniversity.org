<p>Media Release - MP Otago Jacqui Dean - 7 November 2007</p>
<p>Dean – Immigration Changes Wrong For Queenstown</p>
<p>Otago MP Jacqui Dean said she was concerned that a tightening of immigration regulations could see Queenstown’s supply of hospitality staff cut off at the knees and she intended to make the region’s case known.</p>
<p>The Government is currently reviewing schemes which fast-tracked work permits and allowed overseas workers into the country to fill jobs.</p>
<p>But Mrs Dean said while a review might be needed to keep overseas workers out of jobs that kiwis could fill in other parts of the country, Queenstown had a special case because it simply did not have an unemployment problem.</p>
<p>“There’s no point in claiming that these workers are taking jobs away from Kiwis – read the statistics, there is no unemployment in Queenstown.</p>
<p>“Queenstown is a unique region which, I believe, has a special case when it comes to securing unskilled overseas workers to meet the needs of the tourism and hospitality sectors.”</p>
<p>And Mrs Dean said any changes could very well cost these industries dearly.<br>“There’s an identified shortage of unskilled staff in Queenstown, so by moving the goal-posts here and blocking overseas workers the Government is effectively cutting off the lifeblood of the country’s fastest growing regions.<br>“This is a short-sighted policy shift which is, and will continue to have, far-reaching ramifications for business in Queenstown.</p>
<p>“I just think it’s really sad that the Government would consider sabotaging growth in Queenstown by cutting off the region’s supply of willing workers in this way.”</p>
<p>Mrs Dean said she intended to bring the matter up with Immigration Minister Clayton Cosgrove to ensure that he was aware of Queenstown’s special needs.<br>ends  </p>
