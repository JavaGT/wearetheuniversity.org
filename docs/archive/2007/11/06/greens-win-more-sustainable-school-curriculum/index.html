<p>Greens win more sustainable school curriculum</p>
<p>The Green Party welcomes the release of the new school curriculum today, which will ensure that all school children are able to learn more about issues of sustainability and environmental responsibility.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks to the efforts of Education Spokesperson Metiria Turei and the many submissions that were made, the new document improves significantly on the draft curriculum.</p>
<p>&quot;It includes a better recognition of education for sustainability and of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, which was dropped entirely from the draft curriculum. This is a success for the many New Zealanders who made submissions on the draft curriculum content,&quot; Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons says.</p>
<p>&quot;The stronger emphasis on these important aspects of New Zealand life means that children progressing through the school system will be much better equipped for the New Zealand&#39;s future as a world leader in sustainability, which the Prime Minister aspires to.</p>
<p>&quot;The many hundreds of submissions that advocated for the inclusion of these two crucial elements showed just how committed the public are to a sustainable and Treaty based nation.&quot;</p>
<p>As well as the Green Party pushing for sustainability and the Treaty of Waitangi to be included in the school curriculum, under the terms of its cooperation agreement with the Labour Government, they have also negotiated $13 million dollars investment into environmental education.</p>
<p>&quot;Such investment ensures that schools, teachers and students have the skills and critical thinking needed for the coming challenges of a world undergoing climate change and depletion of resources.</p>

<p>&quot;While pleased with the inclusion of sustainability as a Value, I am disappointed that it was not made a core curriculum Principle,&quot; Ms Fitzsimons says.</p>
<p>&quot;The Green Party will continue working towards having sustainability included as a core Principle, which we see as an essential stepping stone to realising the Prime Minister&#39;s goal of New Zealand being &#39;the first nation on earth to be truly sustainable&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
