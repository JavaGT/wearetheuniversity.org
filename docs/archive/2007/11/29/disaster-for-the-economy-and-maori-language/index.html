<p>&#39;Another disaster for the economy, and for the language&#39; - Hone Harawira</p>
<p>&#39;Another disaster for the economy, and for the language&#39; Hone Harawira, Maori Party Spokesperson for Communications Thursday 29 November 2007</p>
<p>&quot;Teletech&#39;s decision to outsource its call-centre to the Philippines is another disaster for the state of this country&#39;s economy, as well as for this country&#39;s first language,&quot; says Hone Harawira, Maori Party Spokesperson for Communications.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s no surprise though. Vodafone has also outsourced its contact centre for prepay customers to Cairo of all places,&quot; said Harawira, &quot;but it&#39;s still hard to stomach when you see how much of our business is being lost overseas.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One month out from Christmas, and a hundred Teletech workers in Palmerston North have just been told their jobs will be gone come April next year,&quot; said Harawira. &quot;Some Christmas for those poor buggers - it&#39;s no wonder people are heading over the ditch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This government&#39;s ability to lose jobs to overseas markets seems to be matched only by their ability to lose workers to overseas countries,&quot; said Harawira.</p>
<p>&quot;But the other big concern for us is what it will mean for our language of communications here in Aotearoa&quot; said Harawira.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m on the road a lot and I use 018 to help find people, and I&#39;ve always been really impressed, and quietly proud too as a matter of fact, about just how quickly Kiwi operators respond to queries about Maori names and Maori places,&quot; says Harawira. &quot;Sadly that will all change now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Teletech reckons that their Filipino operators speak &#39;good American-English&#39;, but that won&#39;t mean a thing in a country where people speak Kiwi-English and there are literally thousands of Maori names in everyday use.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can just see what&#39;s going to happen once it goes overseas - &#39;Harrywearer (Harawira) - can you spell that please? Whypappakowree (Waipapakauri) - can you spell that please?&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ll be asking the Minister of Communications, and the Minister of Maori Affairs, what steps they&#39;ll be taking to ensure operators can understand and respond properly to requests for Maori names,&quot; said Harawira, &quot;but given this government&#39;s record on things Maori, we won&#39;t be holding our breath for a positive response. We will however be working on proposals to help safeguard the language in the future&quot;</p>
