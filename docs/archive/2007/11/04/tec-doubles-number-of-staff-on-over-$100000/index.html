<p>TEC doubles number of staff on over $100,000</p>
<p>The Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) is yet another government agency rewarding its staff with rocketing salaries, says National’s Tertiary Education spokesman, Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>In reply to written questions it was established that between 2003/4 and 2006/7 the number of staff paid over $100,000 rose from 20 to 50.</p>
<p>“In 2003, the highest pay was $181,000 but by 2006, with the appointment of CEO Janice Shiner, the highest salary rose to $404,638.</p>
<p>“Labour has presided over massive wastage in tertiary education that amounts to around $1 billion in the past eight years. In only four years the number of staff receiving more than $100,000 has gone up 150%.</p>
<p>“It worries me greatly that a CEO who was brought in to sort out the mess in tertiary education is paid more than $400,000 and is leaving next year whether the reforms work or not.</p>
<p>“Labour is leaving a legacy of poor planning and wastage in tertiary education and must justify the money being spent on TEC salaries while the sector is in disarray.”</p>
