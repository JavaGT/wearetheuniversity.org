<p>Public To Have Say On Universities Of Technology Bill</p>
<p>New Zealand First&#39;s education spokesperson Brian Donnelly says he’s very pleased that his Education (Establishment of Universities of Technology) Amendment Bill has been voted to select committee.</p>
<p>The Bill, which amends the Education Act 1989 and seeks to establish a new category of tertiary institution, a university of technology, arose out of New Zealand First’s Confidence and Supply agreement with the Government. It attempts to future-proof New Zealand’s tertiary education framework.</p>
<p>“The Bill recognises the importance of building and fostering relationships between business, industry and scientific research at a tertiary level. The establishment of a non-university class of institution for technology will provide scope to develop workplace skills and knowledge to a level comparable to overseas education providers.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, the Bill allows for students to move across various levels of tertiary education, with delivery of appropriate sub-degree programmes and pathways which allow them to progress to higher levels of education and training while pursuing their career goals.</p>
<p>&quot;I am welcome this chance for the public and interested parties to have their say and I firmly believe that many will see the opportunity it provides for students to engage in research and practice in an environment that presents a variety of career opportunities for research and development expertise,&quot; concluded Mr Donnelly.</p>
