<p>Simon Power National Defence Spokesman</p>
<p>14 April 2003</p>
<p>Poor Govt planning leaves Navy high and dry</p>
<p>&quot;The Navy will be left high and dry for more than a year without decent training capacity because of a lack of foresight by the Government, says National&#39;s Defence spokesman, Simon Power.</p>
<p>The only training frigate, HMNZS Canterbury, will be decommissioned next year, well before the new ships commissioned by the Defence Force, under Project Protector, are expected to arrive in 2007.</p>
<p>Mr Power says such a lack of adequate training capacity will strip the Navy of properly trained personnel and leave the frigates Te Kaha and Te Mana vulnerable.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Navy was better resourced, it could afford to cover the poor planning gap by keeping the Canterbury operating.</p>
<p>&quot;Our personnel are highly regarded for their expertise but, once again, shoddy equipment is letting them down.</p>
<p>Mr Power says it is not good &#39;reputation management&#39; that New Zealand will have to go cap-in-hand to borrow a suitable training ship from another Navy.</p>
<p>&quot;And what if the Government can&#39;t negotiate to borrow a frigate?</p>
<p>&quot;Does that mean we will have to employ foreigners to operate Te Kaha and Te Mana?</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s Defence Force spending is a disgrace. Our defence men and women can&#39;t do their jobs properly without adequate training and equipment&quot;, says Mr Power.</p>
