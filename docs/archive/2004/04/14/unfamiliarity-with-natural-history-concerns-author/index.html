<p>Unfamiliarity with New Zealand’s natural history concerns author of new book</p>
<p>The New Zealand public does not appreciate just how decimated this country’s fauna has become, according to the author a new book from Canterbury University Press.</p>
<p>Lincoln University ecologist Kerry-Jayne Wilson has written Flight of the Huia: Ecology and conservation of New Zealand’s frogs, reptiles, birds, in response to what she says is a widespread lack of understanding of New Zealand’s fauna and its vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is one of the world’s special places with one of the world’s unique biotas, but I am constantly disappointed by how little most New Zealanders know about the natural history of their country. I hope this book will do something to address this,” she says<br>.<br>Since humans first settled here, 58 endemic species of birds have disappeared and another 43 are threatened or endangered.</p>
<p>But it has been 40 years since the last extinction, which Kerry-Jayne Wilson puts down to what she describes as the remarkable but under-valued work of conservation managers.</p>
<p>She claims there is no consistent philosophy towards conserving New Zealand’s heritage and believes conservation efforts are likely to remain ad hoc, reactive and at the discretion of political will.</p>
<p>“I’m convinced we could prevent the extinction of any more native birds, reptiles, amphibians or bats. We are clever enough to do it, but I am not sure we have the commitment to do it.”</p>
<p>Ms Wilson says conservation needs to be considered as important as health and education.</p>

<p>Flight of the Huia, which is Ms Wilson’s first book, brings together a wealth of information on ecology in New Zealand much of which, until now, has only been available in scientific journals.</p>
<p>The book is the first to present a history of faunal change in New Zealand and reviews the ecology and conservation of birds, mammals, reptiles and frogs , providing concise, yet comprehensive, information suitable for the general public, students and ecologists.</p>
<p>Flight of the Huia: Ecology and conservation of New Zealand’s frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals, by Kerry-Jayne Wilson, Canterbury University Press, 2004; paperback, 228x152mm, 411pp, colour photos and illustrations, RRP $49.95</p>
