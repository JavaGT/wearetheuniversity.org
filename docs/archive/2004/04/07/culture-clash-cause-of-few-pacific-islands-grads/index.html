<p>Classroom culture clash concerns Canterbury University’s Samoan PhD graduate</p>
<p>One of the few Samoan students to graduate with a PhD from the University of Canterbury, says the under-achievement of some Samoan high school students in New Zealand is the outcome of a culture which considers it disrespectful to question elders.</p>
<p>Silipa Silipa, who graduated yesterday (Tuesday) with the first ever doctorate in Education and Pacific studies conferred by Canterbury University, says many Samoan students are struggling because of a culture clash in the classroom.</p>
<p>His findings are based on a study of Samoan students at a Christchurch secondary school and discussions with high school principals.</p>
<p>Mr Silipa says many students are told by their parents not to question or challenge their elders and to respect their teachers, which can inhibit their participation in classroom discussions.</p>
<p>“The majority (of Samoan students) are silent, passive, not talking. Not inter-acting or not being questioning. It’s not part of their culture to dominate the conversation.</p>
<p>“It’s really a hard thing to do. So you try to sort of talk, but back home you are suppressed to question your parents and so forth. It’s contradicting in the mind.”</p>
<p>Mr Silipa wants teachers to recognise and understand this element of the Samoan culture, and not to assume that a student who does not take part in classroom discussions is not interested in learning.</p>
<p>“When the Samoan students don’t speak, the teachers concentrate on those who are articulate,” he says.</p>
<p>Mr Silipa’s degree was conferred yesterday morning, at the first of four graduation ceremonies to be held in the Christchurch Town Hall this week.  </p>
