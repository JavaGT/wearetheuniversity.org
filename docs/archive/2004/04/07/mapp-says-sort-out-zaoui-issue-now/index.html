<p>Mapp says sort out Zaoui issue now</p>
<p>Sorting out the future of Ahmed Zaoui must be the new Inspector-General of Security&#39;s first job, says National&#39;s Immigration spokesman, Dr Wayne Mapp.</p>
<p>He says a new Inspector-General must be appointed urgently.</p>
<p>Dr Mapp is commenting on Matt Robson&#39;s complaint to the Police Complaints Authority, which he says is only intended to drag out the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the new Inspector-General&#39;s job to decide whether or not Mr Zaoui is a national security risk.</p>
<p>&quot;But instead, the Inspector-General is likely to be blocked from doing his job by a new wave of litigation from Mr Zaoui&#39;s lawyers.</p>
<p>&quot;The Belgium Appeal Court found Mr Zaoui guilty of involvement with terrorist organisations.</p>
<p>&quot;The Refugee Status Appeals Authority was wrong to substitute the fully argued case in Belgium, which was emphatic that Mr Zaoui was a danger to Belgium&#39;s security, with their own one-sided version.</p>
<p>&quot;It is time we stopped spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on prolonged litigation, appointed a new Inspector-General, and let him get on with his job&quot;, says Dr Mapp.</p>
