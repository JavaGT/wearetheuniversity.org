<p>Hon Bill English MP</p>
<p>National Party Education Spokesman</p>

<p>Playing hooky to hikoi unacceptable - English</p>
<p>&quot;It is unacceptable that parents are excusing their children from school to take part in seabed and foreshore protests,&quot; says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#39;re playing hooky to hikoi - they&#39;re supposed to be in school.</p>
<p>&quot;The Education Minister should be asking who is looking out for these students and why they weren&#39;t at school yesterday.</p>
<p>&quot;The parents of these children should be taking a far more responsible approach to education.</p>
<p>&quot;This blatant disregard for the law comes off the back of damning statistics that show the number of children playing truant jumped 35% last year,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education statistics show the number of cases being investigated by truancy officers jumped to 26, 082 last year, up from 19, 676 in 2002.</p>
<p>&quot;Every possible tool must be used to ensure our children attend school.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a tolerance of truancy culture in New Zealand that must be confronted.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government needs to show some leadership and stop cringing about the firm measures needed to combat this problem,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
