<p>Victoria Students Angry At International Fee Increase</p>
<p>The Victoria University Council has once again prioritised surplus over students, increasing tuition fees for International students by 2% across the board with an extra 3% increase for law and commerce subjects, said Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) President Amanda Hill today.</p>
<p>“International students are seen by management as walking revenue. They have experienced massive fee increases over the last five years and the increasing greed of tertiary institutions will damage the reputation of Victoria and other institutions globally” Hill warned.</p>
<p>“The Council is prepared to force further hardship on these students by increasing their fees in order to protect a lucrative source of income,” said Hill.</p>
<p>“Funding the tertiary sector is the job of government, not International students. Can Victoria continue to sustain huge growth in International student numbers without compromising quality for both international and domestic students?”</p>
<p>International students are at the mercy of higher exchange rates, and are increasingly in need of assistance like food parcels and emergency grants, Hill said. The University must invest in better support services for International students.”  </p>
