<p><strong>Wednesday, 28 April 2004, 4:39 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Zero Waste Should Still Be Dunedin&#39;s Goal</p>
<p>Green MP Mike Ward is concerned Dunedin may be turned into a regional rubbish dump, after reports the Dundein City Council&#39;s zero waste working party had been dissolved and reformed as the &#39;resource recovery and waste working party&#39;.</p>
<p>Mr Ward, Green Party Spokesperson on Waste, welcomed the progress the zero waste working party had achieved, including introducing kerbside recycling.</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#39;s hope that a change in name will not result in a shift in focus away from these admirable projects.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ward expressed concerns the change in working party title meant the Dunedin City Council (DCC) &quot;appeared to be backtracking on commitments to achieve a waste-free city.&quot;</p>
<p>Media reports today that the DCC is investigating a combined landfill for the Clutha, Waitaki and Dunedin districts are worrying Mr Ward.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be disappointing if Dunedin, the jewel of Otago, were blighted by the presence of a massive regional landfill.</p>
<p>&quot;All local authorities, including Dunedin, need to work towards making landfills a thing of the past.</p>
<p>&quot;The strategy now needs to minimise the amount we throw away and to recover the resources of products that have reached the end of their life.</p>
<p>Mr Ward is currently in the final phase of a tour of the South Island on his recumbent tricycle, where he has been talking to local authorities and people involved in waste initiatives.</p>
<p>&quot;The message they have been giving me is: &#39;give us the legislation!&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;There are wonderful local initiatives taking root around the country, but to be successful there needs to be legislation to underpin their efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;While there is some disagreement about the detail, everyone is saying that extending producer responsibilities are a bottom line, and most favour landfill levies and landfill bans,&quot; concluded Mr Ward.</p>
