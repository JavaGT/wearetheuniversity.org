<p>Dr Lynda Scott</p>
<p>National Health Spokeswoman</p>
<p>22 April 2004</p>
<p>Stagnant drug budget sees patients suffer</p>
<p>New Zealanders&#39; tolerance for having medicines changed continually is staggering, says National&#39;s Health spokeswoman Dr Lynda Scott.</p>
<p>Government&#39;s sole drug funding agency, PHARMAC, is considering replacing Lipitor, the most prescribed and evidenced as the most effective cholesterol-reducing drug available, with a similar cheaper drug, Lipix. It is a decision that is being criticised by leading cardiologists.</p>
<p>Dr Scott says the Government has backed PHARMAC into a corner over the decision.</p>
<p>&quot;For the three years to 2003, government funding for PHARMAC remained stagnant, at $512 million per year. There is an increasing demand for drugs, as well as price increases yet the budget has remained the same</p>
<p>&quot;Thousands of people are suffering from high cholesterol and cardiovascular disease paying the price for reduced access to very effective medication.</p>
<p>Dr Scott says changing the drug may reduce costs in the short-term, but in the long term costs will increase.</p>
<p>&quot;A less effective drug can lead to increased hospitalisations, more drugs for patients, and expensive surgery further down the track.</p>
<p>&quot;PHARMAC and the Government must put the best interests of patients first, not just the short-term bottom line, when making this decision&quot;, says Dr Scott.</p>
<p>&quot;This decision needs to be reconsidered in light of criticism from leading cardiologists on behalf of their patients&quot;.</p>
