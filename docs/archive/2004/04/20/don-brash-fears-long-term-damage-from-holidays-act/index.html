<p>Don Brash MP National Party Leader</p>

<p>Don Brash fears long-term damage from Holidays Act</p>
<p>National Party Leader Don Brash has launched a scathing attack on the Holidays Act, describing it as &quot;a step back to the days when New Zealand was closed at the weekend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The immediate effect of the legislation was a substantial reduction in employment over Easter. The Restaurant Association stated that about 30% of restaurants and cafes stayed closed over Easter because of the Act, and a further 20% decided to open with fewer staff than usual. The Government has artificially boosted the pay of some workers, at the expense of eliminating the jobs of thousands of others.</p>
<p>&quot;Many fruit growers in Central Otago shut down over Easter, and cherry growers are particularly worried about the Christmas period when cherries must be picked.</p>
<p>&quot;Exporters cannot just put a surcharge on sales. They are price takers, not price makers, in international markets,&quot; Dr Brash says. &quot;Even when businesses in the hospitality trade add a surcharge, this inevitably means less custom and thus fewer employment opportunities.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The consequences of this are only gradually emerging. Our financially struggling health boards are now figuring out the costs to them - after all, hospitals cannot close for business for a day or two, or even an hour or two. Nor can all the support service industries, those who for instance, do cleaning for the disabled, the sick and the elderly.</p>
<p>&quot;There are plenty of other aspects of the Holidays Act that will boost costs to business, and thus reduce job opportunities and reduce incomes.</p>

<p>&quot;None of this is necessary. If we assume that it is being done with the best of intentions, rather than as a sop to Labour&#39;s union friends, as it appears, then it is misconceived. It is based on the fantasy that government can simply dial up an income for people,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;It is also based on a public sector, glide-time mentality, typical of a group of ministers who have spent their entire working lives in the public sector. But in the modern economy business is a seven-day-a-week affair, and those businesses are open for more than eight hours a day.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government is putting in place labour laws appropriate to the 1950s public sector, not to a modern economy at the beginning of the 21st century,&quot; says Dr Brash.</p>
