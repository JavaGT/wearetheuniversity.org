<p>More Canterbury University students at the bottom of the world</p>
<p>As many as 100 students from the University of Canterbury will spend 10 days in Antarctica, after the signing of a formal agreement with Antarctica New Zealand.</p>
<p>The organisation has made a five-year commitment to the on-ice component of the university’s Graduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies.</p>
<p>Antarctica New Zealand will fly 20 students to the ice each year , and provide them with food, clothing and field work equipment.</p>
<p>The Director of Canterbury University’s Gateway Antarctica programme, Professor Bryan Storey, is delighted.</p>
<p>“This is the first time that we have had a five-year commitment from Antarctica New Zealand which is great news for the course. The on-ice experience makes this trip unique in the world and provides a very valuable training experience for future Antarcticans.”</p>
<p>The chief executive of Antarctica New Zealand, Lou Sanson, says the agreement builds on the relationship his organisation already has with Canterbury University.</p>
<p>“We value our association with Gateway Antarctica’s staff and students and look forward to the relationship going from strength to strength.”</p>
<p>88 students have completed the Antarctic Studies course since it began in 1998.</p>
<p>A recent survey of graduates found more than half of them are currently involved in Antarctic-related work.</p>
<p>“Although I knew the course was fulfilling its objectives, it is great to see this impression backed up by the results of the five year survey,” Professor Storey says.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to the continued success of the course in future years”.</p>
