<p>Green MP to launch Dunedin &#39;Buy Local&#39; campaign</p>
<p>Green MP Mike Ward will be launching the Dunedin Greens&#39; &#39;Buy Local&#39; campaign when he visits the city on his South Island Trike tour this weekend.</p>
<p>Mr Ward, the Green Party Spokesperson on Small Business, will kick off the promotion by visiting some of the businesses that have already got on board and presenting them with their &#39;Buy Local&#39; stickers. The Dunedin Greens will then be approaching other companies over the next few months to ask them to encourage their customers to &#39;Buy Local&#39;. They will also be installing a &#39;Buy Local&#39; window display at their Stewart Street office.</p>
<p>Nelson-based Mr Ward, 61, is cycling 1021km from Bluff to Nelson to promote how easy it is to be Green and to gather stories to take to Parliament. A North Island leg will follow next spring.</p>
