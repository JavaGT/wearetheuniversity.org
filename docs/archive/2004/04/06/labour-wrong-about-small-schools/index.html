<p>Bill English National Education Spokesman</p>

<p>Labour wrong about small schools</p>
<p>The Education Minister&#39;s plans to improve education by closing or merging small schools will rob Kiwi kids of the quality education they deserve, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>Research by the National Education Monitoring Project for the Ministry of Education on educational outcomes in relation to school size concluded that &#39;school size is not an important factor influencing student achievement&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;So, bigger is not better. In many cases, smaller schools do a better job at meeting their students&#39; needs&quot;, says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents are the best people to decide what school their kids will thrive at. For many, a big school is not the best place to get a good education.</p>
<p>&quot;But Labour is bent on taking choice away from parents and forcing them to send their kids to big schools.</p>
<p>&quot;And for kids at small schools still threatened with closure, their futures are now resting in the hands of mediators.</p>
<p>&quot;Mediators can&#39;t get the best outcomes for each individual child like a parent can.</p>
<p>&quot;Education is a first step on the ladder to a fulfilled life and our kids don&#39;t have the luxury of a second go,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
