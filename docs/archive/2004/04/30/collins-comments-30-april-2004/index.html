<p>Collins Comments 30 April 2004</p>
<p>Judith Collins MP for Clevedon<br>30 April 2004</p>
<p>Civil Union Bill The Labour Government is looking at the idea of giving same sex couples the rights in law of married couples. The debate has arisen because of the impending introduction of the Civil Union Bill. Those in favour of the Bill say that a civil union would strengthen existing same sex relationships. I&#39;m sure many married couples can burst that little bubble. It takes something more than a law change to make a strong relationship.</p>
<p>Helen Clark has previously stated that civil union will not affect the sanctity of marriage. I&#39;m not quite sure what it is supposed to do. I wonder what difference there is supposed to be between a &quot;civil union&quot; and the existing &quot;civil marriage&quot; service. What particular difference will there be in a marriage celebrant&#39;s service? I don&#39;t care what private arrangements adults make for their own living arrangements. If this bill was about according property rights to gay couples then the Property Relationships Act pushed through in the last Parliament already did that.</p>
<p>What does annoy me is the hypocrisy. If Miss Clark is so hell bent on having the state sanction gay marriage, then why doesn&#39;t she have the courage to put that forward. This Clayton&#39;s marriage bill is simply there to further erode the value of traditional marriage.</p>
<p>Miss Clark has also stated that there will be an &quot;omnibus&quot; bill; the purpose of which is to delete all reference to marriage, husband and wife from a raft of legislation. What next?</p>

<p>Youth Parliament New Zealand youth have the opportunity to have their say in Parliament in August. Each MP selects a student from their electorate to take their seat in Parliament. Schools select one student from their school who has written an essay on why they should be selected. I will choose my representative from that group. This is a great opportunity for youth to experience Parliament first hand, develop skills and interact with other youth. The youth press gallery which imitates the press in the gallery will run adjacent. Information has been sent to all secondary schools in the electorate.</p>
<p>ANZAC Day</p>
<p>Please can we all agree that there should be NO political statements by any speaker on ANZAC Day. I am sick and tired of ANZAC Day&#39;s special significance being spoilt by people desperate to make themselves relevant.</p>
<p>ONE MILLION DOLLARS</p>
<p>The Government is spending $1million of your money on a website about the Treaty of Waitangi. The treaty has only three articles and takes up half a page. Look for yourself on <a href="http://www.treatyofwaitangi.govt.nz">www.treatyofwaitangi.govt.nz</a>.</p>
