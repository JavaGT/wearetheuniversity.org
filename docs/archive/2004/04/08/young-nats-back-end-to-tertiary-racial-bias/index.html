<p><strong>Thursday, 8 April 2004, 5:56 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Young_Nationals">New Zealand Young Nationals</a></strong></p>
<p>Young Nats back end to racial bias in tertiary education</p>
<p>The Young Nationals are today releasing a discussion document which highlights what the group says is &#39;the urgent need to remove racial bias from New Zealand&#39;s tertiary education sector&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Preferential access to restricted courses, ambiguous Treaty clauses in policy statements, endless iwi consultation and &#39;affirmative action&#39; schemes which institutionalise favouritism in staff recruitment deserve to be questioned,&quot; says Young Nationals Chairman, Jamie Simpson.</p>
<p>Examples quoted in the paper include Auckland University&#39;s preferential entry schemes for Maori, like the &#39;MOPAS&#39; programme for commerce students, the &#39;MAPAS&#39; scheme for medicine students, as well as favoured entry for tangata whenua into Law, Education, Engineering, Science, Planning, Political Studies and History.</p>
<p>&quot;The race-based quotas at Victoria University are just as bad. They advertise a &#39;quota for Maori students applying for first-year programmes in Law&#39;, with &#39;consideration for Maori&#39; in other limited entry programmes.</p>
<p>&quot;The Young Nationals fail to see how lowering entry standards for one ethnic group will be of benefit to anybody - even the favoured group. Our members say that tutoring and academic support should be provided to anyone who needs it.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s easy to understand why many non-Maori students are resentful and believe (in most cases, incorrectly) that their Maori classmates have been shown unfair favour,&quot; says Mr Simpson.</p>

<p>&quot;Massey, Lincoln, Canterbury and Otago Universities all demand Maori Consultation on ethics issues before research is approved, while Waikato University has places on its ethics committees reserved for Maori members.</p>
<p>&quot;The Auckland College of Education has more questions to answer than most. It has a six page policy which says the institution seeks &#39;to honour the Treaty of Waitangi by actions in our employment of staff, selection of students and the development and delivery of programmes and services&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Expectations are growing among students for a return to common sense, impartiality and fairness in tertiary institutions,&quot; Mr Simpson says.  </p>
