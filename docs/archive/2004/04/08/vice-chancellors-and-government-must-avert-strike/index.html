<p>Vice Chancellors and Government must avert university staff strike action</p>
<p>Students are today calling on Vice Chancellors and the Government to act quickly to avert university staff strike action plans by meeting staff pay claims.</p>
<p>&quot;The Vice Chancellors need to make a decent pay offer to staff to stop disruptive strike action,&quot; said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA) &quot;University managers have an obligation to students to provide the right conditions for study - including fair pay for university staff.&quot;</p>
<p>Staff at universities have voted to take up to five day&#39;s strike action in support of pay claims and new national collective agreements for academic and general staff.</p>
<p>&quot;The government and the universities will be to blame if strike action goes ahead. They must start to value university staff in New Zealand,&quot; said Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Government wants universities of a world class standard, they have to start putting their money where their mouth is and fund them properly,&quot; said Fitzsimons. &quot;Students are keenly aware of the fact that staff at New Zealand universities are overworked and underpaid and support their claims for better pay and conditions.&quot;</p>
