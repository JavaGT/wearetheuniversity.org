<p>Agent Orange Issue Getting Darker</p>
<p>New Zealand First veteran affairs spokesperson Bill Gudgeon wants to know how much more evidence the Health select committee needs before it recognises that Vietnam veterans were sprayed with Agent Orange and are victims of an orchestrated cover-up,”.</p>
<p>“The after effects have not only affected veterans but also their families and someone must take responsibility.</p>
<p>“Dr Lachlan Irvine from Canberra University, in his evidence to the New Zealand Parliamentary select committee, has demolished the official and academic line adopted by successive New Zealand governments. Dr Lachlan is here with the support of former Commander of 161 Battery Lt Colonel John Marsters.</p>
<p>“Dr Irvine has raised questions about the McLeod report and also about New Zealand research standards and pointed out that the information had been seriously misrepresented.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders in Vietnam fought alongside American and Australian troops who were exposed to agent orange and this has to be accepted officially once and for all,” said Mr Gudgeon.  </p>
