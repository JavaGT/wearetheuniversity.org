<p>Victoria Management School celebrates top billing</p>
<p>The Victoria Management School at Victoria University is celebrating its success in the Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) exercise.</p>
<p>The School, as a nominated academic unit, received an average weighted quality score for fulltime equivalent staff of 3.2 (see page 212 of the PBRF Report). This places it ahead of all of the other management schools in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Commerce &amp; Administration, Professor Pat Walsh, was pleased with the School&#39;s performance.</p>
<p>&quot;Victoria Management School is a relatively new entity at Victoria University, so to come out tops in the Performance-Based Research Fund exercise against some very stiff competition is a great result. The School&#39;s staff members have shown a commitment to excellence in research and this has been confirmed in the PBRF exercise.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Walsh said in the crowded international marketplace for quality managers, the School&#39;s students and researchers need to stand apart.</p>
<p>&quot;The School believes that what will set apart the managers of the new millennium will be those with the ability to foster an environment of creativity, where new ideas for products or running organisations are allowed to blossom.</p>
<p>&quot;Building on the University&#39;s strengths in management – we established our MBA degree more than 20 years ago – Victoria Management School aims to be recognised as New Zealand&#39;s premier centre for creative management scholarship. The results of the PBRF exercise show that its academics are well on the way to achieving that aim.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Walsh said within the School, the management programme scored even more highly with an average grade of 4.7 percent, beating all but one other business or commerce programme in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;For members of the School&#39;s management group to achieve such a very high rating across the whole national tertiary commerce and business sectors is a fantastic result. It also place management in the top echelon of research groups at the University.&quot; Professor Walsh said the PBRF had shown that many of the School&#39;s academic staff are internationally-recognised leaders in research into management, Mâori business, human resources and industrial relations, and tourism and management.</p>
