<p>Waikato University Proves Itself The Quiet Achiever</p>
<p>Waikato University has proved itself the quiet achiever in the Performance-Based Research Fund results, scoring top in 25% of its subject areas, top four in just under half and attracting an extra $1.3 million (3%) in research funding.</p>
<p>&quot;We were second only to Auckland in the number of firsts we scored,&quot; says Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould. &quot;I&#39;m extremely pleased that the overall quality of our research has been explicitly recognized and rewarded financially in the PBRF exercise.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s all the more satisfying that our overall placing of a close fifth in research quality was achieved despite the fact that we have been merged with a teachers&#39; college for some time, and staff at that college did not traditionally do a lot of research.</p>
<p>&quot;Auckland and Otago are in the process of merging with teachers&#39; colleges so it will be interesting to see what effect that has on their performance under PBRF in future.&quot;</p>
<p>Waikato University was first in:<br>* Pure and Applied Mathematics, score 5.7 * Chemistry, 5.1 * Computer Science, Information Technology and Information Sciences, 4.7 * Molecular, Cellular and Whole Organism Biology, 4.2 * Communications, Journalism and Media Studies, 3.8 * Management, Human Resources, Industrial Relations, International Business and Other Business, 3.4 * Accounting and Finance. 2.8</p>
<p>&quot;Taken together these scores show we have the top computing and mathematics school and the top management school in the country for research performance,&quot; says Professor Gould.</p>
