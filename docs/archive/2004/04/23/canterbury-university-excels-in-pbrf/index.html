<p>Canterbury University excels in PBRF</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury has come a close second to the University of Auckland in terms of its PBRF research quality rankings, taking top position in four subject areas and first equal in two.</p>
<p>The positive showing reflects a high proportion of A and B gradings for academic staff who submitted research work for assessment by the Tertiary Education Commission.</p>
<p>Of the 22 institutions involved in the PBRF, Canterbury has the smallest proportion of the lowest R grading.</p>
<p>It has the highest quality scores in engineering and technology, earth sciences, agriculture and other applied biosciences, anthropology and archaeology.</p>
<p>The university shares the top scores in religious studies and theology, and architecture, design, planning and surveying.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Roy Sharp says the results underline Canterbury’s reputation as a strong, research-led university. “In the face of competition for student numbers, Canterbury has continued to focus on its core disciplines and to nurture its research capabilities.</p>
<p>“This exercise will have a positive benefit for tertiary education in New Zealand, as it has previously in Britain – we will all be looking to improve our performance.”</p>
<p>Professor Sharp expects the PBRF results will assist with recruitment of staff and students.</p>
<p>“The university already attracts some of the best quality candidates worldwide to our fulltime academic staff.</p>
<p>One of those, the Director of the newly-created Centre for Bioengineering, Professor Tim David, who chose to further his career down-under after a period at Leeds University, says Canterbury is at least its equal.</p>
<p>“The breadth of research ability and practice being undertaken at Canterbury is quite astonishing. We have people of the calibre of Mike Steel from mathematics and Miles Fairburn from history – both eminently qualified in their field, both undertaking ground-breaking research. That is now being recognised not only in the PBRF but also with their elevation to membership of the Royal Society.”  </p>
