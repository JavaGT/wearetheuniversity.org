<p>Give Kids A Good Start - Bring Back Plunket</p>
<p>The best way to prepare children for school is to ensure they&#39;re raised in a strong, committed family - we can do this by bringing back Plunket, ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the past decade we&#39;ve marginalised, what once was, a wonderful service,&quot; Miss Coddington said in a speech to Auckland&#39;s Milford Ladies&#39; Probus Club.</p>
<p>&quot;I would never have managed to help bring up four healthy, independent, educated children to adulthood without the strong support I got from the Plunket nurses who visited me and helped me become a confident mother.</p>
<p>&quot;If I could achieve just one thing in my time as a politician, it would be to have Plunket nurses going into the homes of every mother who leaves hospital - for as long as it takes - to get mother and baby bonded, and to ensure other children are developing normally.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has turned Plunket nurses into the equivalent of car mechanics doing warrants of fitness. They tick the boxes and fill their visit quotas in order to get their funding.</p>
<p>&quot;Today too many little children are starting school who&#39;ve never been taught how to hold a book or a pencil. They&#39;re hungry and have no lunch. How can teachers hope to teach literacy and numeracy to these disadvantaged littlies?</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s no use pouring millions of dollars into bounty hunters - the Trevor Mallard way - or into benefits, or student loans for nonsense qualifications when these illiterate children leave school as failures.</p>
<p>&quot;We should be putting the resources into tried and tested organisations like Plunket, so those crucial first five years - when children are learning from their parents - are not wasted.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ve thrown Plunket out with the bathwater. It&#39;s time to bring it back,&quot; Miss Coddington said.  </p>
