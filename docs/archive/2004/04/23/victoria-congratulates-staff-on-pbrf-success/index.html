<p>MEDIA RELEASE 23 April 2004</p>
<p>Victoria congratulates staff on PBRF success</p>
<p>The release of the Performance-Based Research Fund results highlights the strong research culture at Victoria University, says Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon.</p>
<p>&quot;Victoria had the third highest average quality score of the 22 tertiary education organisations that participated in the PBRF. This is a credit to the excellent work of our researchers and the support they receive from other staff.</p>
<p>&quot;Our third place is not surprising and confirms what was we already knew, that Victoria has a very strong research culture and that our staff rank with the best scholars in New Zealand and in many cases, internationally. It is particularly pleasing that so many of Victoria&#39;s schools and disciplines rated so highly.</p>
<p>&quot;While the additional income to be allocated in this first year of the PBRF was relatively small, the $1.57 million that Victoria is likely to receive is about $200,000 more than we would have received under the EFTS funding system. This will help us to develop further our research strategies.</p>
<p>&quot;The total number of A, B and C staff at Victoria is above the national average while we also have considerably fewer R graded staff than the university average. At Victoria, we are committed to having our top researchers teach at undergraduate level, allowing students to benefit from their experience and world-class knowledge and research. All of this reinforces our position as a research-led institution.</p>

<p>&quot;The experience overseas where research performance exercises have been implemented is that rankings provide a stimulus to aspire to greater heights and Victoria will be doing just that. We have no intention of resting on our laurels. We have a number of initiatives in place to assist both our top researchers to do even better and those who aspire to improve their own performance.</p>
<p>&quot;Our initial assessment of the income from the PBRF indicates that in the first year, our income will benefit by about an additional $200,000. But with the subsequent growth in our external research income and postgraduate degree completions – both of which are key determinants of PBRF funding – we will do even better in future years.</p>
<p>&quot;I also welcome the Government&#39;s commitment last night, as expressed by the Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education), the Hon Steve Maharey, that it plans to inject greater funding into research through the PBRF. &quot;</p>
