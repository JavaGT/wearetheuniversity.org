<p>English applauds Hood criticism of the TEC</p>
<p>The Government must sit up and listen to the damning criticism its tertiary reforms have received from Auckland University&#39;s Oxford-bound Vice-Chancellor, says National Education Spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>He was responding to remarks made by Dr John Hood in the University of Auckland 2003 Annual Report.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Hood has come out swinging against the Minister and his ill-conceived dream - the Tertiary Education Commission,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>Dr Hood says the independence of our universities is at risk from a &quot;raft of moves towards more regulation and greater centralisation&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I fully endorse this sentiment from Dr Hood. The independence of the tertiary sector is at risk from this Labour government and its nanny-state mentality.</p>
<p>&quot;The TEC acts more like a head office every day and its usefulness is constantly questioned by those within the tertiary education sector.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a bureaucratic nightmare with universities and polytechs facing a never ending paper war in a bid to keep up with the TEC&#39;s demands.</p>
<p>&quot;The millions of taxpayer dollars spent on this new organ of Government would be much better spent on raising the quality of tertiary education.</p>
<p>&quot;Tens of thousands of tertiary students and thousands of academics are better placed to make these decisions than the best Minister or the smartest bureaucrat in Wellington will ever be,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Hood is to be commended for speaking out so forthrightly&quot;.  </p>
