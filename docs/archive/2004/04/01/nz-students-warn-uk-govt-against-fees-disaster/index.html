<p>NZ students warn UK Govt against fees disaster</p>

<p>New Zealand students warn United Kingdom Government against fees disaster</p>
<p>Students in New Zealand are expressing solidarity with their British counterparts who are currently involved in a last minute fight at Westminster to stop the introduction of top up fees in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>&quot;Uncontrolled fee rises and the New Zealand student loan scheme to fund these fees rises has been an unmitigated disaster in New Zealand,&quot; New Zealand University Students&#39; Association Co-President Fleur Fitzsimons advised her British counterparts.</p>
<p>&quot;The New Zealand experience should serve as a warning to the British government,&quot; said Fitzsimons. &quot;The effects of these policies and the repayment of loans threaten key aspects of our economy and society with research showing that New Zealand graduates are putting off having children as a result of their loans&quot;.</p>
<p>The largest ever contingent of students will converge at Westminster today for last minute lobbying of MPs after the UK National Union of Students took the unprecedented move to close their annual conference to ensure they can be in London.</p>
<p>&quot;Student leaders from Canada, America and Australia have joined New Zealand students in detailing the devastating impact of even higher fees in tertiary education in their countries and warning the British government against such moves,&quot; said Fitzsimons.  </p>
