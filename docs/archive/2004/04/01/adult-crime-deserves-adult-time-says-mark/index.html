<p>Media Release</p>
<p>01 April 2004</p>
<p>Adult Crime Deserves Adult Time Says Mark</p>
<p>New Zealand First Law and Order spokesperson Ron Mark has renewed his calls for tougher penalties for youth offenders who commit serious violent crimes.</p>
<p>A 14-year-old North Canterbury student has admitted raping a schoolgirl in a Kaiapoi cemetery.</p>
<p>“The judge faces a serious dilemma in sentencing this sex attacker because of his age and there is a real risk he will soon be out preying on young girls again,” said Mr Mark.</p>
<p>“If this young offender is not stopped now after committing such a horrendous crime then who knows what he will be capable of in the future.</p>
<p>“My private members bill is designed to lower the age of criminal responsibility for offenders like this boy.</p>
<p>“The maximum sentence that he will receive will not act as a deterrent. He needs to be taken out of circulation and taught the hard way that his behaviour will not be unpunished.</p>
<p>“The purpose of my private members bill is to remove undesirable characters like this boy from society to protect young girls,” concluded Mr Mark.</p>
