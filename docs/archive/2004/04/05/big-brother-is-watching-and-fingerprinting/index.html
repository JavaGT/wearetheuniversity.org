<p><strong>Monday, 5 April 2004, 8:44 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Big Brother is watching...and photographing...and fingerprinting</p>
<p>Green MP Keith Locke is warning that US plans to fingerprint and photograph everyone visiting that country could lead to a universal ID system, with huge ramifications for individual freedoms and human rights.</p>
<p>The Bush administration has announced that from September 30th, citizens of 27 countries - including Britain, New Zealand and Australia - who had been allowed to travel within the United States without a visa for up to 90 days, will now be fingerprinted and photographed when they enter the country.</p>
<p>&quot;Fingerprinting is for people accused of a crime, not law-abiding citizens,&quot; said Mr Locke, the Green Party&#39;s Human Rights spokesperson. &quot;Do we really want to see a universal ID card, with everyone&#39;s fingerprint and facial recognition characteristics built into a chip?</p>
<p>&quot;This action takes us further down the road of &#39;Big Brother&#39; state surveillance. It will provide the US with a huge international database of personal information which could easily be misused or passed on to other agencies or governments.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand should be joining those countries who are protesting these measures, perhaps even joining Brazil, which has fingerprinted American visitors in retaliation for the US move.</p>
<p>&quot;So far, the New Zealand government has been meekly complying with American demands in this area and trying to meet that country&#39;s October 26th deadline for biometric details to be inserted in a chip on every New Zealand passport.</p>

<p>&quot;The indications have been that digital facial recognition characteristics will be put on the chip, but after yesterday&#39;s announcement it is likely New Zealand will be told to include fingerprints as well.</p>
<p>&quot;These measures intrude not only on the privacy of New Zealanders visiting America but also the thousands of us forced to stop over there en-route to other destinations,&quot; said Mr Locke. &quot;In the short-term, this might impact on passenger numbers flying via the US, in the long-term it&#39;s another ominous intrusion into our personal privacy.&quot;  </p>
