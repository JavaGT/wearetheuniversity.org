<p>MEDIA RELEASE 5 April 2004 Public Affairs</p>
<p>Victoria names new director of IT</p>
<p>Victoria University has appointed a new Director to manage its Information Technology Services.</p>
<p>Alan Dempster, who runs his own strategic consultancy company Arisaig Ltd, takes up his role on April 14.</p>
<p>Mr Dempster, who has a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Glasgow, worked at Victoria in the early 1980s as a lecturer in the then Department of Mathematics, Statistics and Operational Research. He returned to Britain in 1984 to undertake postgraduate research at London&#39;s Imperial College before joining a telecommunications consulting company involved in commercialising university research.</p>
<p>Returning to New Zealand in 1992, he has held various positions as a strategic consultant working on the application of new telecommunications and commercial techniques to various businesses. This included working as Head of Payments and Transaction Services at Trust Bank, implementing core-banking systems for Kiwibank, and as acting development manager for collection systems at the Ministry of Justice (formerly the Department for Courts).</p>
<p>Mr Dempster is also a director and chairman of Citylink Ltd, a position he has held since 1995.</p>
<p>As Director of the University&#39;s Information Technology Service, Mr Dempster will be responsible for approximately 90 staff providing services to a total of more than 25,000 students and staff over four major sites in the Wellington region.</p>

<p>Mr Dempster said he was attracted to the position by the chance to work in the tertiary sector again and particularly by the new developments in Informatics and Information Services at Victoria.</p>
<p>The Informatics Group, established last year and headed by Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Warwick Clegg, incorporates the School of Information Management and the School of Mathematical &amp; Computing Sciences, and will work closely alongside information services – the University Library and IT Services – to integrate information-related developments throughout the University.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a very exciting group. While it&#39;s a dispersed group, they&#39;re all about information, covering its technology, management, science, collection and dissemination and it will be fascinating to involved in the interaction, taking ideas from academia and being able to implement them.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Clegg said Victoria was particularly pleased to appoint Mr Dempster to the position.</p>
<p>&quot;From his role as Chairman of Citylink, and his work as a consultant in the Wellington area, Alan brings to Victoria a huge range of contacts which will be beneficial to our own operation.&quot; For more information, contact Alan Dempster on 025 454 550</p>
