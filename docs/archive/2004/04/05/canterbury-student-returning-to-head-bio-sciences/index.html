<p>April 2, 2004</p>
<p>Former Canterbury student returning to head biological sciences.</p>
<p>Professor Paula Jameson has been appointed Head of the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Canterbury.</p>
<p>She is currently a professor of plant biology at Massey University’s Institute of Molecular BioSciences and will take up her new position at Canterbury in June.</p>
<p>A distinguished 24-year career has seen her rise through the ranks at Otago University’s Botany Department and Massey University’s Department of Plant Biology and Biotechnology. She was made head of that department in 1994.</p>
<p>The service she has given to her profession over the years includes Cabinet appointments to the Independent Biotechnology Advisory Council and the Marsden Fund Committee, where she chaired the Evolution, Ecology and Behaviour panel.</p>
<p>Professor Jameson has published extensively in the area of developmental plant biology, with more than 80 refereed papers, reviews and book chapters and a host of other research outputs. Her work has tended to focus on the role of plant hormones in growth and development.</p>
<p>She has wide experience in external grant applications, having secured a total of $1.6 million in funding herself, and has acted as a referee for various scientific journals.</p>
<p>Professor Jameson was a member of the Biological Sciences Panel for the Performance Based Research Fund and was awarded life membership of the New Zealand Society of Plant Physiologists in 2002, after serving as a Council member from 1982 to 2000 and chairing the society in 1986 and 1987.</p>
<p>Christchurch is Professor Jameson’s home town. She completed a BSc (Hons) degree with first class honours and a PhD at the University of Canterbury, both in plant physiology, and was club captain of the University Women’s Hockey Club during her student years.</p>
