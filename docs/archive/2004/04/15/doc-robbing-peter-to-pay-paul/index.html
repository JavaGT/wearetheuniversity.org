<p>DOC Robbing Peter To Pay Paul</p>
<p>“News that the Department of Conservation is setting Operation Ark in motion in the Hawdon and Hurunui Valleys in North Canterbury in order to protect the endangered käkäriki and yellowhead populations is good news for the birds,” said New Zealand First conservation spokesperson Edwin Perry.</p>
<p>“Both species may be under increased threat from a possible stoat and rat plague in South Island beech forests if, as predicted, next summer produces the third beech masting season in five years.</p>
<p>“According to the Minister DoC would respond immediately and robustly to smash plagues in ark areas before they became established.</p>
<p>“However Operation Ark is not being funded by an increase in the Conservation budget but by money taken from existing biodiversity budgets within the department.</p>
<p>“In other words, moving money from one place to another in order to make grand gestures at the expense of endangered bird populations elsewhere. Stand by for a ministerial photo opportunity of the minister posing with a very expensive dead stoat,” said Mr Perry.</p>
