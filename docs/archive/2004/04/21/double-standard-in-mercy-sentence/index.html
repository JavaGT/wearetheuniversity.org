<p>Judith Collins MP</p>
<p>National Party Family Spokeswoman</p>
<p>21 April 2004</p>
<p>Double standard in mercy sentence</p>
<p>National Party Family spokeswoman Judith Collins says the &#39;mercy&#39; shown to a Pakistani sex offender contrasts starkly with the treatment meted out to a young Sri Lankan girl - who&#39;s deportation case sparked national outrage.</p>
<p>&quot;Why should this Pakistani student escape a criminal conviction because of the consequences he might face in his home country - when the Sri Lankan girl received no such consideration.</p>
<p>&quot;The court has said that one reason behind the ruling was that the student may be &#39;ostracised by his family&#39; on his return to Pakistan.</p>
<p>&quot;Compare that with the treatment of the young Sri Lankan girl. Ahead of her deportation reports suggested she too was at risk of being shunned by her family.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand must be careful to treat these cases with consistency and compassion where appropriate,&quot; says Ms Collins.</p>
