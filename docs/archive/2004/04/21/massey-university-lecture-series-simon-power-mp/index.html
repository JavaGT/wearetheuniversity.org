<p>Simon Power, MP for Rangitikei</p>
<p>21 April 2004</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.</p>
<p>I am particularly happy to address the question of New Zealand tomorrow,<br>for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, my wife Lisa and I have just welcomed our first child into the<br>world, which is the best reason to contemplate what sort of country my son<br>will grow up in.</p>
<p>Second, I have now been in Parliament for a term and a half, which has<br>proved ample time, especially during those long, late nights in the<br>debating chamber, for me to think about the nation&#39;s future - its<br>challenges and its potential.</p>
<p>I have gained a sense that the current leadership of the country hasn&#39;t<br>given enough thought to the future and the needs of my generation.</p>
<p>In my nearly five years in Parliament I have also observed two leadership<br>coups, endured a difficult election campaign for my party during 2002, and<br>now the polls reveal a renewed interest by voters in National. As I said<br>during my maiden speech to Parliament, I didn&#39;t want an easy life, I<br>wanted an interesting one. Politics has not disappointed!</p>
<p>I also said in 1999 in my maiden speech that in ten years&#39; time the type<br>of country I wanted was one that was dynamic, innovative, determined,<br>forward-looking and forward-thinking. Because, just like many of my<br>generation, I feel that New Zealand&#39;s best is yet to come.</p>
<p>But before addressing the local, I would first like to go global, because<br>the 21st century context for my generation of Kiwis is quite different<br>from those of even my parent&#39;s generation.</p>

<p>What are some of the global challenges New Zealand leaders will face<br>tomorrow?</p>
<p>The nuclear risk, whether between states or set off by rogue states,<br>biological terror, global terrorism, global warming and rising sea levels<br>all serve to remind us that we have become a lethal element in our own<br>universe. This challenge affects New Zealand in significant ways.</p>
<p>Our geographical location can no longer be viewed as our ultimate<br>protection.</p>
<p>The world is too interconnected. Violence is creeping closer to our door.<br>Weaknesses are being exploited.</p>
<p>We must, therefore, in the first instance, discuss more openly our defence<br>relationship with Australia. With so many Kiwis living there we cannot do<br>otherwise. New Zealand&#39;s Defence and Foreign Policies must provide<br>security for our people. It is a core duty of responsible governments to<br>provide security and it is time for my generation - the most travelled<br>generation ever - to front up to what political partyies have to say about<br>the nature of our strategic environment and about our future security<br>needs.</p>
<p>One of the things that distinguishes tomorrow&#39;s generation is that we have<br>grown up in the marketing age. Slogans are ignored; sound-bites are<br>sneered at, and spin doesn&#39;t wash. The Knowledge Wave talkfest left us<br>cold. Self improvement seminars can&#39;t fool us.</p>
<p>People of my generation want to know their choices so they can make them -<br>not somebody else. 21st century leaders of New Zealand will have to find<br>new ways of connecting, new ways of offering people choice.</p>
<p>There is a feeling among my generation that we have been silenced for too<br>long by governments; ignored by leaders who have believed that policy is<br>too complex for us to understand.</p>
<p>That is their failure, not ours.</p>
<p>In a speech I gave at a National Party Conference back in 2001 I said we<br>must learn to speak a new language, a language of innovation and success,<br>and a language of inclusion and hope.</p>
<p>I still firmly believe that, but I have learned since that to speak is not<br>always to be heard, so it is even more important for leaders to talk<br>directly, openly, and honestly about the choices facing citizens.</p>
<p>The rise of global technologies affecting political communication is a<br>worldwide phenomenon, and a problem for political leaders of all stripes.<br>In 1968, when Bobby Kennedy began his tragic bid for his party&#39;s<br>presidential nomination, the average sound bite was 48 seconds. Today we<br>have but 7 seconds, which is not long enough to give any sort of<br>meaningful information to people. Nor is it long enough for people to<br>properly judge politicians.</p>
<p>Information is wonderfully diverse, it is often instantaneous, and it is<br>empowering, but I am concerned by the effects that the 24/7 news cycle has<br>had on the quality of political communication.</p>
<p>It is harder for people to see clear choice from the sheer noise that is<br>produced. This challenge will need to be overcome if my generation&#39;s<br>demand for a better dialogue with its leaders is to be achieved.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll address one more related global challenge - namely the growing gap<br>between the knowledge of the few compared to the alienation of the many.<br>Leadership in the 21st century will see greater specialisation and<br>technical expertise demanded of office-holders. The Log Cabin to White<br>House journey will give way, if it hasn&#39;t already, to the passage of new<br>generations of highly educated leaders. Prime Ministers and Presidents who<br>are specialists and skilled in decision-making will, in my judgment,<br>become the norm among first world countries.</p>
<p>This phenomenon will impose significant burden on leaders who attempt to<br>bridge the &#39;Knowledge gap.&#39; They will need to bring their citizens along<br>and allow them their choices. To treat citizens as ignorant in the future<br>will result in further alienation from politics and politicians.</p>
<p>Adaptability will be crucial.</p>
<p>Turning now to our domestic concerns, the changing demographic profile<br>facing my son&#39;s millennium generation is dramatic.</p>
<p>A report by the Future Foundation, which was commissioned by British Bank<br>First Direct (a division of HSBC Bank), predicts that my son could start<br>school at age 3, will retire at 80 and live to be 120.</p>
<p>A longer life will also mean that he will learn, work and play more.</p>
<p>The report says this generation will have room for three or more careers<br>and several periods of formal learning.</p>
<p>Many of them could find themselves going back to University in their 60s<br>to retrain.</p>
<p>80% of the business tools my son will use at work have yet to be<br>invented.</p>
<p>Now, I am motivated to ensure that he enjoys a first-class education so he<br>can enjoy the fruits that freedom and choice deliver, and that he will<br>thrive here, living in a prosperous and confident first-world country.</p>
<p>Education will indeed be the key for unlocking the potential of all New<br>Zealanders.</p>
<p>Education liberates, it gives people more and better choices, and it gives<br>us the skills we will need to adapt to change.</p>
<p>But we must do better.</p>
<p>We must provide incentives to improve the quality of our education system.<br>No child or young adult can attain the &quot;fullest reach of his or her<br>powers&quot; without:</p>
<p>- Quality teachers being better paid.</p>
<p>- Better parental involvement in decisions affecting their<br>children.</p>
<p>- Curriculum content that reinforces basic skills while also<br>challenging our best and brightest, and</p>
<p>- The development of a school ethos that embraces success and<br>talent, not merely participation and mediocrity.</p>
<p>As someone who believes strongly in encouraging each and every individual<br>to reach their fullest potential, I view with a natural suspicion the<br>activity of any sector group which, by its sheer force of numbers, or by<br>its close links to the governing Party, imposes its own political agenda<br>without consideration for the common good.</p>
<p>The PPTA is a good case in point. Its campaign for higher wages last year<br>did nothing to benefit the quality of teaching of our young, nor has it<br>done anything to recruit more quality young people into the teaching<br>profession.</p>
<p>The PPTA&#39;s concern, it seems, was in maintaining its authority with the<br>all-knowing Ministry of Education. And this leads to a wider point about<br>my generation and its attitude towards unions.</p>
<p>As at December 2002, 17.6% of the workforce belonged to unions. I would<br>suggest to you that very few of those would be under 40 years old. In<br>fact, young people in the 18-24 age group were significantly less likely<br>to be union members</p>
<p>- Only 9%, compared to the 17.6% already mentioned.</p>
<p>This is the result of changes in employment. Gone are the days when a man<br>or woman went into a job at the age of 18 and retired at the age of 60<br>without ever changing their employer.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s workforce is flexible and mobile. Most of my peers who graduated<br>with law degrees don&#39;t practise law. Around this room there will probably<br>be a number of you who will not end up working in the profession you begin<br>in, or you will change your career more than once.</p>
<p>People want flexibility in their employment, many don&#39;t want to be<br>attached to a distant group of people, paying subs and getting little more<br>than outdated class warfare propaganda in return. A true sign of<br>yesterday&#39;s debate.</p>
<p>Unions&#39; relevance to people of my generation is minimal. We believe in<br>doing things for ourselves rather than filling the coffers of those who<br>purport to represent us when, in fact, they are only furthering their own<br>narrow political agenda.</p>
<p>Education will also need to drive our economic performance.</p>
<p>This is because the 21st century will impose significant economic<br>challenges for this country and we will have to adapt and surpass our<br>competitors if we are to survive, let alone excel.</p>
<p>In New Zealand Tomorrow, we must provide the right environment for<br>biotechnology, filmmaking and computer software, for instance. We must<br>create incentives to accelerate the growth of more vital research &amp;<br>development. New Zealand has the talent, we just need the will to unleash<br>it. But let&#39;s not forget what we do best. The Knowledge Wave Conference<br>may not be around in 20 years&#39; time but our agricultural sector certainly<br>will.</p>
<p>My generation is also impatient at the mindless and endless raft of<br>bureaucratic red tape thrown in the path of our young innovators and<br>entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Government regulation and onerous compliance costs crush risk-taking.</p>
<p>My generation does not have the patience to stand in line or fill out<br>endless forms.</p>
<p>We have better things to do and little time to spare.</p>
<p>We see no sense in the raft of barriers to doing business in this country.<br>The Resource Management Act is an absurdity for its reliance on cumbersome<br>rules and procedures over simple common sense and good judgment.</p>
<p>People can&#39;t make good judgments if the legislative framework denies them<br>reasonable discretion to balance competing interests and reach considered<br>decisions.</p>
<p>This government, by its actions, believes it can no longer trust people to<br>make sensible decisions without consulting its bureaucratic manuals and<br>its PC agents from Wellington.</p>
<p>It&#39;s about time &#39;Big Brother&#39; went on a diet.</p>
<p>In my maiden speech I paid tribute to the role that the farming sector has<br>as the backbone of our country&#39;s economy. They provide real jobs. They<br>nourish our provincial towns. They are people who have an innate feel and<br>affection for the land they work.</p>
<p>I hold that view even more strongly after my five years in politics.</p>
<p>Farmers actually produce something tangible from which the whole nation<br>then shares, and have always competed in an increasingly competitive - and<br>often highly protected - international market.</p>
<p>The recent floods in the Rangitikei have further heightened my sense of<br>admiration and respect for the tens of thousands of people who work in the<br>agricultural and farming sectors.</p>
<p>These are hard-working men and women whose contribution is often taken for<br>granted until we see them under some sort of duress.</p>
<p>We must always support our rural sector, a community of Kiwis who deserve<br>their concerns being listened to and addressed as much as any who live in<br>our cities. Their problems might not be the same but there is nothing<br>intrinsically different about the hopes and aspirations of a person living<br>in Gore from someone living on the North Shore.</p>
<p>Finally, let me turn to the politics of New Zealand tomorrow.</p>
<p>What I sense is a growing impatience among my generation at the poor<br>quality of political discussion, at the political correctness-gone-bad, at<br>being told how to live and what to think by a government whose<br>socialisation experiences are so very different from those of most New<br>Zealanders.</p>
<p>I sense that people are growing weary of one narrow worldview.</p>
<p>So, let me also make this clear. I stand unequivocally for freedom.<br>Economic freedom, personal freedom, political freedom - the freedom, above<br>all, to choose between alternatives.</p>
<p>But freedom means more than one&#39;s view on globalisation, free trade deals,<br>or debates around more or less state intervention in the economy.</p>
<p>The freedom I am talking about is the liberation of our political<br>imaginations.</p>
<p>The freedom to dream and the freedom to pursue those dreams without<br>restraint or interference.</p>
<p>The freedom to think what we like and the freedom to express our<br>thoughts.</p>
<p>And in this sense the old arguments of the 1980s and 1990s no longer<br>resonate with people of my generation. Even the old left-right divide has<br>lost much of its force with us.</p>
<p>Continuing debates about the reform period have to me become largely<br>meaningless. New Zealand simply had to change. I&#39;m pleased it did. But it<br>is time to move on, accepting and learning from the past.</p>
<p>Lessons have been learned.</p>
<p>The key one for me is that our leaders must prepare people for change.<br>Preparation and providing choices is crucial to fostering social<br>inclusion.</p>
<p>My generation, however, is far more focused on solutions and that, I<br>think, is the real challenge of New Zealand tomorrow.</p>
<p>To solve the hard problems, those policy areas that are caught between the<br>old divisions of left and right.</p>
<p>Policies like the future of our education system, National Superannuation,<br>foreign and defence policy, and relations between us all - these policy<br>areas must be discussed openly and informatively in front of the public.</p>
<p>I want to contribute to providing solutions.</p>
<p>Finally, I am located on the so-called centre-right because I hold, above<br>all, that the freedom of the individual is central to their existence.</p>
<p>But I care equally about helping those New Zealanders who need a hand up.<br>Compassion is, in fact, good policy as well as showing the common decency<br>we all feel towards those in need.</p>
<p>Freedom and compassion are not mutually exclusive. They form part of my<br>wider focus on encouraging New Zealanders from all walks of life to be the<br>best that they can be.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, Cullen, Wilson, Mallard and Goff risk, I think, being<br>only a footnote in our political history because they are not proving bold<br>enough to lead. Their poll-driven politics is safe but it is not providing<br>leadership or laying down signposts for the future. There is no vision.<br>No chapter will be written about them.</p>
<p>My generation will not so much be passed the torch as to have to go and<br>find it. I am committed to convincing people that things can be better.</p>
<p>We are committed to charting the course for New Zealand tomorrow.</p>
<p>There&#39;s not a moment to lose.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
