<p>Pansy Wong MP</p>
<p>Export education package pure cosmetics</p>
<p>Proposed changes to the export education sector are purely cosmetic and will do nothing to restore the damage that this Government has done, says National&#39;s Asian Relationships spokeswoman Pansy Wong.</p>
<p>She is commenting on a multimillion-dollar cash injection into the sector, announced today ahead of Education Minister Trevor Mallard&#39;s trip to China, Korea and South East Asia to lift New Zealand as a world-class study destination.</p>
<p>Mrs Wong says the cash injection and the trip are too late.</p>
<p>&quot;It can&#39;t repair the damage caused by the Government&#39;s lack of action with rogue foreign students, and monitoring of educational institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister, on his last trip to China only eight months ago, assured officials the Government was taking a number of steps to improve our export education sector.</p>
<p>&quot;However, that trip didn&#39;t improve our reputation.</p>
<p>Mrs Wong says evidence of that can be found on an official Chinese website &#39;Monitor of Overseas Education Information&#39; where New Zealand appears under a warning.</p>
<p>The Chinese website, <a href="http://www.jsj.edu.cn">www.jsj.edu.cn</a>, says &#39;...Right now there are many problems concerning Chinese students in New Zealand such as: tensions between students and schools or home stays, traffic accidents, fighting, some have been drawn to sexual pursuits, gambling, drugs, triads, fraud, kidnapping and murder...&#39;.</p>
<p>Mrs Wong says to bolster New Zealand&#39;s reputation the Minister needs to deal with the problem. He needs to ensure educational institutes are properly accredited and monitored; require overseas students to drive with a New Zealand licence, and remove students whose visa&#39;s have expired and have no valid reason to be here.</p>
