<p>English: CPIT in disarray</p>
<p>Christchurch Polytechnic, which is at the centre of a community education budget blow-out scandal, has failed to produce an annual report since 2001, says National&#39;s Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>In a clear breach of the Education Act, Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (CPIT) did not produce an annual report in either 2002 or 2003.</p>
<p>Section 220 of the Act states that every tertiary institution must present an annual report &#39;as soon as practical after the end of each academic year&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;This failure to provide any record of their operations or use of public money is an absolute failure of accountability,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Serious questions have to be asked of Steve Maharey, the Minister of Tertiary Education. The responsibility to ensure public scrutiny and transparency within the sector rests with him.&quot; CPIT is accused of orchestrating a funding scam where students are given incentives for enrolling in a free, unchecked computer course that has brought in millions of dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;If they can&#39;t get the little things right - like getting their reports filed - why on earth should we continue to fire public money in their direction?</p>
<p>&quot;This failure at the most basic level is a huge embarrassment for a Government struggling to explain it&#39;s tertiary education spending priorities,&quot; says Mr English.  </p>
