<p><strong>Monday, 31 May 2004, 9:16 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Minister must accept CPIT payment</p>
<p>Steve Maharey must accept Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology&#39;s offer to pay back $80,000 that it spent on inducements in breach of the rules, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;Maharey has been nit-picking about the rules but hasn&#39;t indicated that he will take any action over the CPIT funding scam.&quot;</p>
<p>The chairman of the CPIT council told Christchurch radio listeners that CPIT would pay back the $80,000 it spent on purchasing the gifts it gave to those enrolling in the controversial Cool-IT course if it is found that the inducements were in breach of the rules.</p>
<p>&quot;Section 3.1.1.2 of the Interim Guide to Tertiary Funding expressly states that money cannot be spent on inducements,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey should take the money to show that the Government will enforce the prudent use of taxpayer money.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand the $80,000 covers only book vouchers. CPIT also paid $20 to schools and libraries for each enrolment and this money should also be paid back.</p>
<p>&quot;I welcome moves by the Government to cut the funding and tighten the rules,&quot; says Mr English.  </p>
