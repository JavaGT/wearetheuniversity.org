<p>150 years of Parliament: Is this as good as it gets?</p>
<p>As Parliamentarians polish their speeches and prepare their palates to celebrate 150 years of representative democracy in New Zealand, the Green Party is inviting the public to come along to a seminar on where we might go over the next 150 years.</p>
<p>Rather than dwelling on the past, speakers at the &quot;Democracy: Is this as good as it gets?&quot; seminar will explore a variety of future possibilities, including Te Tiriti, anarchist, republican and gender-equal models.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe this is as good as it gets,&quot; said host and Green List MP, Metiria Turei. &quot;But I personally hope our democracy will evolve in a way that delivers a lot better for all those marginalized people who don&#39;t get a great deal out of the present system.</p>
<p>&quot;Any successes achieved by parliaments over the last 150 years shouldn&#39;t blind us to the injustices. Only by an honest appraisal of what&#39;s gone before can we adequately plan for what comes next. Rather than just back-slapping each other over a job well done, politicians owe it to the people to ask how we can all create a just and peaceful society.&quot;</p>
<p>Metiria said entry to the seminar was free.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re hoping all sorts will turn up: students, businesspeople, media, even the odd non-Green MP. Like Parliament, everyone will get a chair and a chance to participate in question-time but, unlike the House, you won&#39;t need a big advertising budget or a safe seat to get in the door.&quot;</p>
<p>Theme: &quot;Democracy: Is this as good as it gets?&quot; Time: 5:30-7:30pm Monday 24th May. Place: National Portrait Gallery, Ground Floor, Bowen House, Wellington.</p>
