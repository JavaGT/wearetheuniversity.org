<p>Gerry Brownlee MP<br>National Party Maori Affairs Spokesman</p>
<p>20 May 2004</p>
<p>National hopes foreshore views swamp committee</p>
<p>The National Party is making it easier for people to have their say on the<br>future of New Zealand&#39;s beaches through its website <a href="http://www.foreshore.co.nz">www.foreshore.co.nz</a><br>.</p>
<p>Deputy Leader and Maori Affairs spokesman Gerry Brownlee has today<br>launched a new initiative which will fast-track submissions on the<br>Foreshore and Seabed Bill.</p>
<p>&quot;Parekura Horomia and John Tamihere, in particular, have signalled that<br>they believe there is room to move on this legislation at the select<br>committee level.</p>
<p>&quot;That can only mean more concessions that effectively give one race rights<br>over and above those of others,&quot; says Mr Brownlee.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s in everyone&#39;s interests for the committee to be presented with a<br>balanced range of views, because some Maori have already indicated they<br>plan to target this Bill at the select committee stage.</p>
<p>&quot;National is voting against this legislation because it perpetuates<br>Labour&#39;s view that there are two sets of rules in New Zealand - one for<br>Maori and another for non-Maori.</p>
<p>&quot;That approach is made even more farcical by Victoria University research<br>which suggests that &#39;on current trends, in 200 years, everybody is going<br>to have virtually some Maori ancestry&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;That makes mockery of virtually all policies that set out to divide this<br>nation on the basis of race. That&#39;s precisely why the foreshore and<br>seabed should be vested in the Crown - but without all the fishhooks of<br>Labour&#39;s flawed plan.</p>
<p>&quot;National does not support the notion that because you are Maori you<br>automatically have a more special connection to the coast than fifth or<br>sixth generation New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s therefore important that all New Zealanders - regardless of race -<br>exercise their democratic rights and have their say,&quot; says Mr Brownlee.</p>
