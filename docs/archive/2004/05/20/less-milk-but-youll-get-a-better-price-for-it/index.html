<p>Less milk, sure, but you&#39;ll get a better price for it</p>
<p>Green MP Ian Ewen-Street says the slightly higher production of conventionally farmed cows compared to an organic herd reported in a current trial is outweighed by the higher price farmers get for organic milk.</p>
<p>Massey University&#39;s Dairy Cattle Research Unit near Palmerston North has been comparing the two approaches since 2001 and has this week reported a &quot;small difference in productivity, animal health and soil and herbage quality&quot; in favour of the mainstream approach.</p>
<p>&quot;Conventional farms almost always &#39;outperform&#39; organic farms, especially if the organic farms are in conversion mode, but only in a productivity sense,&quot; said Mr Ewen-Street, the Green Party&#39;s Agriculture and Organics Spokesperson.</p>
<p>&quot;The crucial calculation is farm gate returns. A lower productivity with a higher sale price per unit can, and frequently does, give a higher financial return to the farmer. A 10 to 30 per cent premium for certified organic products usually more than offsets the reduction in outright productivity.</p>
<p>&quot;And it is important to recognise that the premium price for organic milk reflects consumers&#39; willingness to pay for a tastier and healthier product.</p>
<p>&quot;But if you look at long-standing organic farms the productivity of an organic herd often does beat the conventional equivalent anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>Before entering Parliament Mr Ewen-Street farmed sheep and beef cattle on 500-acre Biogro-certified organic farm in the Marlborough Sounds.</p>
