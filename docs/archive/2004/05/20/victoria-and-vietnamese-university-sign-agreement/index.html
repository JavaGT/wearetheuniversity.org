<p>Victoria signs agreement with Vietnamese university</p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington and the Vietnam&#39;s University of Economics yesterday signed an agreement extending the range of courses offered in their undergraduate twinning programme.</p>
<p>The agreement was signed by Professor Neil Quigley, Pro Vice-Chancellor (International) at Victoria University, and Professor Pham Van Nang, Rector of the University of Economics, Ho Chi Minh City. The signing ceremony was attended by the Hon Trevor Mallard, New Zealand&#39;s Minister of Education.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Victoria will invest in library, computer and teaching resources at the University of Economics and employ staff to teach courses to students of the University of Economics. The range of courses offered will also be increased to include law, and applied sciences in addition to business and economics.</p>
<p>Students from the University of Economics will have the option of using these courses as an international training programme, which will allow them to complete a degree at either the University of Economics or Victoria University.</p>
<p>Victoria will provide scholarships to the students who obtain the highest grades while studying in Ho Chi Minh City. Professor Quigley said that this agreement reflects Victoria&#39;s strategy of developing strong relationships with high quality universities in other countries.</p>
<p>Professor Quigley also said that to provide formal recognition for the courses taught at the University of Economics he expected to apply to the Vietnamese Ministry of Education and Training for approval to offer Foundation and Undergraduate level diplomas in Vietnam. Mr Mallard welcomed the initiative shown by the two universities.</p>

<p>“I encourage universities to develop international education initiatives of this type, and am particularly pleased that this relationship will work to strengthen ties between New Zealand and Vietnam.”</p>
<p>Professor Pham Van Nang said the extension of the twinning programme would increase the range of educational opportunities available to students at the University of Economics and increase the ability of his University to teach courses in English and at the highest international standard.
