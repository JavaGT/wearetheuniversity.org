<p>Labour&#39;s tertiary education strategy an expensive failure</p>
<p>Massive enrolments in heavily funded, low-value, low-cost courses have lead to budget blowouts and have shown Labour&#39;s much-heralded tertiary education strategy to be nothing more than an expensive failure, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, while growth in trade training has been capped, growth in community education courses has exploded. In 2000, the Government paid out $13m for 85,500 students. In 2003 the government paid out $105m for 461,000 enrolments.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year, Steve Maharey said he would ensure that &#39;student enrolments are concentrated in areas of high performance and high strategic relevance&#39;. Something has gone awry as we now have thousands enrolled in twilight golf, coffee making and personal grooming courses,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Even the Minister has described these courses as being of &#39;dubious&#39; quality.</p>
<p>Gisborne-based Tairawhiti Polytech enrolled 46,000 people in community education courses, more than population of Gisborne at the time of the last census. Christchurch Polytechnic enrolled more than 96,000 people almost a third of Christchurch&#39;s population, including 76,000 in one CD-based course.</p>
<p>&#39;&#39;These numbers tell the story of an expensive failure. After five years of endless talk and bureaucratic process, Steve Maharey&#39;s tertiary strategy has resulted in this nonsense.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Students, aspiring apprentices, researchers and industry trainees will be frustrated to see so much wastage, while they were told the Government couldn&#39;t afford to back them.</p>
<p>Despite huge demand, trade training has increased by $40miliion since 2000. At the same time community education spending increased by $92million.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government must crack down on this waste and get it&#39;s spending priorities in order,&quot; says Mr English.  </p>
