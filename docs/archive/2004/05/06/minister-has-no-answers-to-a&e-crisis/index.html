<p><strong>Thursday, 6 May 2004, 5:33 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Dr Lynda Scott National Health Spokeswoman</p>
<p>6 May 2004</p>
<p>Minister has no answers to A&amp;E crisis</p>
<p>Health Minister Annette King has no answers to a worsening safety crisis at accident and emergency departments, says National&#39;s Health spokeswoman, Dr Lynda Scott.</p>
<p>Last year&#39;s Ministry of Health quarterly performance scorecard shows that A&amp;E departments of 17 out of the 21 District Health Boards&#39; are not up to scratch.</p>
<p>Dr Scott says the Minister is using every avenue to stop the latest report being released.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister&#39;s got to come up with better than that after numerous reports of seriously compromised patient safety around the country:</p>
<p>- Canterbury DHB and Palmerston hospital have A&amp;E patients banked up in corridors, sometimes several times a week in Christchurch.</p>
<p>- Hutt Valley Hospital Board chairman describes their A&amp;E as the hospital&#39;s weakest link.</p>
<p>- Staff at Wairau hospital says their A&amp;E is running on the bones of its backside.</p>
<p>- A top Wellington A&amp;E specialist resigns in the face of medical incidents.</p>
<p>- Waikato hospital says its A&amp;E should have been upgraded years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;This crisis was exposed only because a DHB accidentally released the scorecard.</p>
<p>&quot;It takes a great deal of time and money to collate this data, but what is the point if no action is taken on clearly identified problems.</p>
<p>&quot;It is time for the Minister to come clean. The public needs reassurance that the A&amp;E crisis will be addressed,&quot; says Dr Scott.</p>
