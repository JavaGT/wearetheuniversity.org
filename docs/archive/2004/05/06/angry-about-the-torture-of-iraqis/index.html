<p>Angry about the torture of Iraqis? Angry about the massacre in Fallujah?</p>
<p>Thursday, May 6 8:30-9:30am</p>
<p>Action outside the US Embassy - while academics and politicians discuss the future of Iraq, thousands are being brutally repressed, tortured and killed by the occupying army. We will be presenting an alternative Iraqi &#39;roadmap to peace&#39; outside the Embassy along with action regarding torture victims. Please come along and pass this along.</p>

<p>Press Release: Iraqi Roadmap to Peace From: Peace Action Wellington Date: Thursday, May 6, 2004</p>
<p>While US Ambassador Charles Swindells hosts a videoconference to discuss the war on Iraq with author Michael O’Hanlon, members of Peace Action Wellington will converge outside of the US Embassy on Thursday morning from 8:30-9:30am.</p>
<p>US Embassy staff member William J. Millman denied local peace activist Valerie Morse entry to the public videoconference because he believes she, ‘clearly demonstrated antipathy toward freedom of speech and the decencies of rational debate.’</p>
<p>These comments are in reference to a speech to be delivered by US Ambassador Charles Swindells at VUW last year which was shouted down by a number of concerned citizens.</p>
<p>‘Despite what the Embassy says, I would happily challenge the Ambassador to a debate on the war on Iraq anytime.</p>
<p>I think most New Zealanders would be fascinated to see how any man could justify the torture and humiliation of Iraqi people being committed by the US and its coalition partners’ said Valerie.</p>

<p>The plan calls an apology and compensation for the victims of the war as a starting point.</p>
