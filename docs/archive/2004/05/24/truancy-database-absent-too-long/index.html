<p>Truancy Database Absent Too Long</p>
<p>Deborah Coddington - Press Releases - Education</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today supported Principal Youth Court Judge Andrew Becroft&#39;s call for a national truancy database to reduce youth offending.</p>
<p>&quot;Judge Becroft&#39;s comments at the New Zealand Principals&#39; Conference in Rotorua at the weekend are welcome. There is no doubt that youth crime is the inevitable counterpart to long-term truancy,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#39;s be absolutely clear about this: our kids are getting themselves into more and more serious trouble because we are allowing them to completely drop out of school.</p>
<p>&quot;Earlier this year, I revealed that of 6,499 children referred to the Non-Enrolment Truancy Service (NETS) last year, 244 could not be found. It is too easy for a child to drop out of one school and never enrol in another. The next time we&#39;ll see that kid is in court.</p>
<p>&quot;When in Opposition, Education Minister Trevor Mallard - in a 1999 media release - promised to create a national database to find children not in school when he said:</p>
<p>`Labour will establish a central records database which will be used for schools to pass information on as children move around. It will be able to show quickly when a child leaves a school without re-enrolling at another&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Education Select Committee urged the Government to establish a truancy database in 2002. Mr Mallard&#39;s meek response was to set up a trial data network to track students through the school system next year. That&#39;s as bad as doing nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s truants will continue to clog the court and welfare systems. One huge part of the solution is to implement a central database as soon as possible,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
