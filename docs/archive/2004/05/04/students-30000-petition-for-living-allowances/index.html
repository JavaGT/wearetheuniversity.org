<p><strong>Tuesday, 4 May 2004, 8:34 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Students present 30,000 strong petition for living allowances</p>
<p>Student leaders from high schools and tertiary institutions will today be presenting a petition of 30,000 New Zealanders calling for a living allowance for all students to Parliament today.</p>
<p>“We have had unprecedented support for our campaign for a living allowance for all students,” said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of NZUSA. “These signatures represent many more voters who think we should move on from talking about the problems associated with student debt and move on to a solution – fast.”</p>
<p>“The Labour Government should take note of the support this campaign is receiving from school students who will probably miss out on a living allowance. Thousands of school students from all over the country are angry about this issue,” said Fitzsimons. “Cashmere High School Head Boy Luke Doubleday will be joining us at Parliament to represent these students.”</p>
<p>“Pressure is building for Labour to make sure all students are entitled to a living allowance. A few thousand extra next year will not be enough when two thirds of students are currently ineligible.”</p>
<p>The 15 boxes of petitions will be presented at Parliament at 1pm today to Greens Co-Leader Rod Donald and MPs from Labour, New Zealand First and United Future. Tertiary and secondary student leaders will address the rally.  </p>
