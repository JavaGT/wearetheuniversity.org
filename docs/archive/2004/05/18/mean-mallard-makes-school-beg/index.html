<p>Mean Mallard Makes School Beg</p>
<p>Tuesday 18 May 2004</p>
<p>Deborah Coddington - Press Releases</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today accused Education Minister Trevor Mallard of making a pauper out of a decile two Auckland school by forcing it to beg for extra funding to pay for routine building repairs and maintenance costs.</p>
<p>&quot;Fruitvale School wrote to the Minister claiming that its operational funding was `ludicrously inadequate&#39;. Rotting fences, quagmire footpaths, cracked concrete and dilapidated structures were cited as needing upgrades.</p>
<p>&quot;The school&#39;s concerns appear to have fallen on deaf ears. Mr Mallard is ignoring the problem in the hope that it will go away - but it won&#39;t. Labour&#39;s financial mismanagement of schools has been highlighted by a recent report showing that over 1,000 schools ran operating deficits in 2002.</p>
<p>&quot;The way forward is to break the State monopoly and fund the students, not the schools. Until that happens, the gap between the `haves&#39; and `have-nots&#39; will continue to grow, and schools like Fruitvale will have to wait and wait,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
