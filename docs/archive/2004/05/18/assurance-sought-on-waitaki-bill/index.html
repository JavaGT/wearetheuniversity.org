<p>Assurance Sought On Waitaki Bill</p>
<p>New Zealand First wants an assurance from the Environment Minister that the Waitaki River Bill will go ahead.</p>
<p>“Despite the withdrawal of Meridian Energy from Project Aqua, there is still an opportunity here for the development of a best practice model for water management and allocation,” said environment spokesperson Jim Peters.</p>
<p>“In its revised form, the Resource Management (Waitaki Catchment) Amendment Bill would enable protection of the river as well as providing for recreational users.</p>
<p>“The control of sustainable river flows for irrigation would provide a further boost for farmers in the area.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First, along with local councils, urges the Government to work with Environment Canterbury to proceed with the bill and provide a total catchment approach to the management of this precious resource.</p>
<p>“The valuable research and engineering work done by Meridian Energy with regard to the application has left in the public domain a major body of information that would cost millions to replicate.</p>
<p>“It would be extremely disappointing to see that work gathering dust when it could be used to ensure the sustainability of the river for present and future generations,” said Mr Peters.</p>
