<p>Labour Govt Penalises TV3</p>
<p>Tuesday 18 May 2004</p>
<p>Deborah Coddington - Broadcasting</p>
<p>The Labour Government, using millions of taxpayers&#39; dollars, is helping TVNZ to eliminate competition from its TV3 rival, ACT New Zealand Broadcasting Spokesman Deborah Coddington revealed today.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is giving $12 million to TVNZ to implement the Charter.</p>
<p>&quot;This edict - forced on the State broadcaster by a nanny knows best Government - commands TVNZ to promote `New Zealand culture and identity&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time, TVNZ is splurging hundreds of thousands of dollars on American TV networks to buy programmes TV3 already runs.</p>
<p>&quot;Last night, TVNZ did a deal with ABC for international news. Now it&#39;s offering $1.3 million for 20/20 - twice as much as TV3 currently pays. TVNZ is also trying to buy Dateline from NBC,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;How does this fit with the objectives of the Charter, Minister?</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has destroyed shareholder value in TVNZ to the extent that less than a year ago, TVNZ tried to save $4 million by sacking current affairs staff and dumping the Assignment programme.</p>
<p>&quot;These latest revelations are yet another example of the Government being unable to prevent a culture of extravagance - from TVNZ`s disgraced chairman Ross Armstrong&#39;s gross overspending on expenses, to now paying double the market rate for overseas programmes just to eliminate competition from the private sector,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
