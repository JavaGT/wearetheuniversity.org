<p>Labour Fails Far North Maori Students</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today slammed the Labour Government for failing to reduce the number of suspensions and stand-downs for Maori children in Northland.</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers of Maori children being suspended or stood-down have skyrocketed. Maori made up 73 percent of suspensions and 70 percent of stand-downs in Northland schools last year,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;Further, Northland Maori suspension rates rose from 226 cases in 2002 to 254 last year - that&#39;s an increase of 13 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Education Minister Trevor Mallard should be ashamed of these figures. It is an indictment on his stewardship of the education portfolio.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite Labour&#39;s `closing the gaps&#39; nonsense, many schools still lack the resources, expertise and motivation to cope with at-risk Maori youth.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT believes choice in education would provide an excellent solution. In overseas countries, school choice - such as Charter Schools - allows professionals to cater for at-risk students with outstanding results.</p>
<p>&quot;This would provide an ideal option for students who are falling through the gaps. The schools would offer greater choice for parents and a second chance for children at risk,&quot; Miss Coddington said.  </p>
