<p>Turia Gives Maori &#39;Hobson&#39;s Choice&#39;</p>
<p>Associate Maori Affairs Minister Tariana Turia&#39;s decision to force a by-election may excite people who enjoy political trouble for Labour, but it is hard to see a good outcome for New Zealand, ACT New Zealand Maori Affairs Spokesman Stephen Franks said today.</p>
<p>&quot;She shouldn&#39;t have been in Cabinet after repeated assertionsthat her duty was to advance the interests of `her people&#39; - Ministers should act in the interests of all New Zealanders. Tolerating her conflict of interests has set precedents that could be used by less well-meaning politicians,&quot; Mr Franks said.</p>
<p>&quot;Maori may now send Labour a message by voting for Ms Turia&#39;s new party. That will cement them into a political ghetto. Thousands of votes in a race-based party will mean other parties can ignore Maori interests, as long as they don&#39;t hold the balance of power. Worse, the race party representatives can ignore the issues all New Zealanders share, and focus solely on those that distinguish and divide.</p>
<p>&quot;Race-voted seats are always a bad idea. But at least when a mainstream party holds them, their MPs have some contact with the issues affecting everybody. When held by race extremists they are dangerous. Race-based seats must go,&quot; Mr Franks said.  </p>
