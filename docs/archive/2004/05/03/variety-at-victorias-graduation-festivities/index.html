<p>Variety abounds at Victoria’s Graduation Festivities</p>
<p>Victoria’s graduating students will be joined by an author, an astronomer, an Oscar-winning designer, a distinguished economist and two former politicians when they receive their honorary doctorates from Victoria University in early May.</p>
<p>More than 1500 students will graduate at the ceremonies on 6 and 7 May, including Mayor Kerry Prendergast, who will receive a Master of Business Administration, and Lorae Parry, author, actor and former Writer in Residence at Victoria, who will graduate with a Master of Arts in Creative Writing.</p>
<p>The familiar sight of hundreds of graduands parading through the streets of Wellington will kick off the celebrations. Parades will be held on both days at 12pm, departing from the School of Law, Government Buildings on Lambton Quay. Graduands will walk along Lambton Quay, up Willis Street and finish at Civic Square at approximately 12.30pm, where they will be welcomed by the Mayor.</p>
<p>If the parade is cancelled, notification will be given on 91ZM, Channel Z, and the Breeze from 10am on the morning of the parade.</p>
<p>Six honorary doctorates will be awarded at the ceremonies:</p>
<p>Albert Jones is an amateur astronomer who co-discovered the brightest explosion seen by the naked eye in the last three centuries. Regarded as one of the finest visual observers of the night sky, Albert Jones uses a telescope he build in 1948 and his work is in high demand throughout the world. Mr Jones will receive an honorary Doctor of Science degree.</p>
