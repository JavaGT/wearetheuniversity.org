<p>Unfair Housing Policy Harming The Needy</p>
<p>Wednesday 26 May 2004</p>
<p>Dr Muriel Newman - Press Releases - Other</p>
<p>Housing Minister Steve Maharey&#39;s refusal to introduce State housing time limits is not just trapping tenants - it is hurting New Zealand&#39;s most needy families, and leaving thousands without a roof over their heads, ACT New Zealand Housing Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Answers to my written Parliamentary Questions have revealed that, as of the end of April 2004, a total of 6,057 people `at risk&#39; or in `serious need&#39; were waiting to be placed in a home by Housing New Zealand,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
<p>&quot;But some families live in State house for decades. Last year, I revealed that one family had rented a $697,000 house, for only $58 a week, for 32 years. This means State houses are no longer the temporary housing safety net Housing NZ was established to provide.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT has long campaigned for Housing NZ tenants to be supported out of State housing as quickly as possible - ensuring that, once a family has found its feet, it can move onward and upward and make room for the next needy family.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly, this is not happening. Even worse, by far, the majority of this 6,057 on the waiting list are families and whanau in dire need of a home. If Labour does not introduce time limits for State houses, these numbers will continue to grow.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government&#39;s housing policies are totally unfair. They are proving to be detrimental to New Zealand, and harming the country&#39;s most vulnerable people. Families in desperate circumstances should not be left in urgent need while others enjoy the security of cheap rent in a State house for life,&quot; Dr Newman said.</p>
