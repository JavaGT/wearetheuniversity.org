<p>Tairawhiti funding scam: the plot thickens</p>
<p>The community education funding scam at Gisborne&#39;s Tairawhiti Polytechnic is getting more outrageous by the week, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>His comments follow revelations that community education students at Tairawhiti were encouraged to enrol in a further free course, in Te Reo Maori, in order to secure additional funding for the polytech.</p>
<p>&quot;These students, who were originally enrolled in a Maori spiritual healing course, were told that it was up to them whether they completed the Te Reo course. They didn&#39;t receive the course materials they were promised,&quot; says Mr English</p>
<p>&quot;A student says they were asked to enrol twice - once during each weekend of the healing course.</p>
<p>&quot;But this was nothing more than a financial transaction. The polytech would have received hundreds of dollars for each enrolment.</p>
<p>&quot;The students estimate that the healing course may have produced up to 60 enrolments in the Te Reo course. It&#39;s quite possible that none of these students even started Te Reo.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year, Steve Maharey said he would ensure that &#39;student enrolments are concentrated in areas of high performance and high strategic relevance&#39;. Now we have polytechs enrolling students in bogus courses for funding purposes - potentially committing fraud.&quot;</p>
<p>Tairawhiti received $21.6 million in community education funding last year for the education of over 47,000 students - most of whom were enrolled in &#39;language and literature&#39; courses. &quot;These revelations raise some very serious questions about the loose nature of community education funding requirements under this Government,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
