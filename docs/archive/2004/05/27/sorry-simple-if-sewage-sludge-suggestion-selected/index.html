<p>Saying sorry simple if sewage sludge suggestion selected</p>
<p>Green MP Mike Ward says he will happily apologise for his recent criticism on the demise of the Dunedin council&#39;s zero waste group if the city adopts one of its councillor&#39;s sewage sludge proposal.</p>
<p>Otago media has reported yesterday that the Dunedin City Council is unhappy with Mr Ward&#39;s comments and would be writing to him to explain the switch from a &#39;zero waste&#39; working party to one focusing on &#39;resource recovery and waste&#39;. Today it was reported that Councillor Jeremy Belcher, if given the budget, could solve problems at Tahuna by ensuring &quot;every tonne of sludge each day is welcomed&quot;. &quot;Councillor Belcher is spot on in his view that this sludge should be seen as a public utility and an opportunity for the city, rather than disposed of as waste,&quot; said Mr Ward, the Green Party&#39;s Waste-free Spokesperson.</p>
<p>&quot;Burying sewage sludge in an energy-strapped agricultural nation that imports millions of dollars worth of fertiliser every year and faces blackouts isn&#39;t terribly smart. Every New Zealand community should be constructing biodigesters to produce methane and mixing sewage residues with green waste to improve the nutrient values of the resulting compost.</p>
<p>&quot;Co-siting the digesters and the composting facilities near the appropriate end-product users, such as greenhouses, minimises reticulation and transport costs and enables the methane to be used as a premium heating fuel. It also avoids the necessity to deal with methane leaking from landfills in the future.</p>

<p>&quot;I would be interested to know what the council thought my comments were on the demise of the Zero Waste group, given that I was simply expressing hope that their commitment to waste reduction remains, whatever they call the group running the strategy. I&#39;m certainly not against resource recovery.</p>
<p>&quot;Either way, I look forward to a continuation of my friendly dialogue with the Dunedin City Council on waste, which was much advanced when I visited them last month on my cycle tour of South Island waste initiatives,&quot; said Mr Ward.  </p>
