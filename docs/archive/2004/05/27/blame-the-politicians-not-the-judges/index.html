<p>Blame The Politicians, Not The Judges</p>

<p>Ken Shirley - Press Releases - Energy</p>
<p>We should not be surprised by the Environment Court&#39;s decision curtailing the water rights that underpin the Tongariro Power Scheme, ACT New Zealand Deputy Leader and Energy Spokesman Ken Shirley said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Since 1973, some of the Wanganui River&#39;s headwaters have been diverted, through canals and tunnels, discharging into the Tongariro River which, in turn, flows into Lake Taupo and down the Waikato River,&quot; Mr Shirley said.</p>
<p>&quot;Back in the 1970&#39;s, we invested many millions in the Tongariro scheme, to contribute to the nation&#39;s energy needs and prosperity. The river flows in the lower Wanganui have been negligibly affected and, of course, the regular flood events ensure a healthy and dynamic river system.</p>
<p>&quot;The foolish expansion of the Resource Management Act to cover metaphysical and spiritual beliefs has led to this decision. The problem has been compounded by elevating myth and legend to a matter of national importance within the RMA.</p>
<p>Why is it an offence to divert water to generate electricity, when it is apparently not an offence to supplement the sun&#39;s natural light with electric lights. Similarly, it seems that no one objects to diverting water for drinking purposes, or to heat water for showers, baths and laundry.</p>
<p>&quot;The RMA was intended to provide for the sustainable management of natural resources. It can never adequately address the nebulous metaphysical wishes of those who wish to apply a selective morality to enhance their own political agendas,&quot; Mr Shirley said.</p>
