<p><strong>Thursday, 27 May 2004, 3:55 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Student campaign wins more allowances</p>
<p>Students have welcomed today’s budget announcement that more students will be entitled to a student allowance thanks to a strong campaign run by students.</p>
<p>“It’s good news for students that more will qualify for a student allowance instead of being forced to borrow from the harsh student loan scheme to live,” said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association.</p>
<p>“Students set the agenda for this policy change: we said that it is not fair that students are forced to borrow to live and that government must increase access to student allowances.”</p>
<p>The budget sees access to allowances restricted for married, divorced and financially independent students on the grounds of consistency with the Bill of Rights Act. These students are now assessed on the basis of their parents income.</p>
<p>“Students are disappointed that the Government have used today’s budget to prevent married, divorced and those judged independent from their parents from accessing living allowances on these grounds.”</p>
<p>“The government can say all they like about consistency with the Bill of Rights Act but their claims are hollow while the allowance system continues to discriminate on the basis of age until a student is 25 years old.”</p>
<p>“A living allowance for all students and reducing student fees is the next step forward in dealing with the student debt crisis.”  </p>
