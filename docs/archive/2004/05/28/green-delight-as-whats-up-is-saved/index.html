<p>Green delight as What&#39;s Up? is saved</p>
<p>Green MP Nándor Tánczos says he&#39;s absolutely rapt that the Government has found the money to see youth counselling hot-line What&#39;s Up? continue its awesome work.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s fantastic that Ruth Dyson has listened to the concerns of the hundreds of students, teachers, parents and other concerned community members who signed the petition to save What&#39;s Up?</p>
<p>Nandor is full of praise for the 12-year-old who was concerned enough to initiate the petition, Shonam Reddy.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m stoked that this valuable service for the youth of Aotearoa will remain open beyond tonight. I congratulate the Minister for seeing the value of this service and in particular, I want to congratulate Shonam and the pupils and staff of Randwick Park School for all their hard campaigning to keep &quot;What&#39;s Up? running.&quot;</p>
<p>Sue Kedgley will present Shonam&#39;s petition to Hon Ruth Dyson at her office (4.1 Beehive) 3.30pm.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
