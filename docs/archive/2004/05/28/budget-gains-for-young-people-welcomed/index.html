<p>Budget Gains for Young People Welcomed</p>
<p>&quot;A budget that delivers for young New Zealanders,&quot; is how Young Labour President Michael Wood describes today&#39;s Budget.</p>
<p>&quot;A key announcement today is the big improvement in access to Student Allowances. This was a key pledge in Labour&#39;s 2002 manifesto, and we are pleased it has been delivered. 12 000 extra students will now receive a full student allowance, and around 24 000 who previously received nothing will get a partial allowance,&quot; Michael Wood said.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, this is just one step towards the universal student allowance system Young Labour supports and advocates for - but it is a significant move in the right direction.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;50% of students will now get some form of allowance. Combined with new funding to ensure that fees do not rise steeply, this shows a clear commitment to improving life for students under Labour.</p>
<p>&quot;We are also pleased with the announcements in the Working for Families package. Young families with children need to be able to get ahead: they need to know that work will pay, and that they will be able to provide a better life for their kids and themselves. Real money in the pocket will deliver that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s proposals are far better than tax cuts could ever be. Support is being delivered to the people who need it most, not to high income earners who are already enjoying a decent lifestyle.</p>
<p>&quot;Young Labour also welcomes the improvements being made to industry training, and particularly the announcement of 500 new places in the popular Modern Apprenticeships Programme - to a total of 8000 by June 2006.</p>
<p>&quot;This budget provides a very stark choice. Labour supports families and young people; National supports putting money into the pockets of those who already have the most - rich old white men like Don Brash,&quot; Michael Woods concludes.  </p>
