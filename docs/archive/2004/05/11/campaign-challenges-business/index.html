<p><strong>Tuesday, 11 May 2004, 12:17 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions">New Zealand Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p>“There’s work to be done, together.” - Campaign Challenges Business</p>
<p>The Council of Trade Unions has today launched a broadsheet under the banner “There’s work to be done, together” which challenges business to work with unions on the real issues facing New Zealand.</p>
<p>“It is a message for business to focus on the real issues, rather than campaigning against every Government measure which might benefit working New Zealanders – including the amendments to the Employment Relations Act,” said CTU president Ross Wilson.</p>
<p>“Our broadsheet states union members’ vision for the future which challenges business to work with unions to build a high-skill, high-wage economy for a better way of life for all New Zealanders.”</p>
<p>The broadsheet will be sent to business, political and community leaders over the next few days.</p>
<p>The CTU is also campaigning to support and strengthen the amendments to the ERA that are contained in the Employment Relations Law Reform Bill.</p>
<p>Workers and union members are expected to send thousands of postcards to the Minister of Labour, Paul Swain, supporting the Bill and the amendments proposed by the CTU.  </p>
