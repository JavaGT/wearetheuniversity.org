<p>Population health complex OPening</p>
<p>Research teams dedicated to improving the health of all New Zealanders now have a new home at The University of Auckland&#39;s Population Health Complex.</p>
<p>The new purpose-built facility is based at the University&#39;s Tamaki Campus, which is distinguished by its collaborative, inter-disciplinary, and research-intensive profile.</p>
<p>The Population Health Complex will be officially opened on Tuesday, June 8 by the Vice-Chancellor of The University of Auckland, Dr John Hood.</p>
<p>An integrated and sustainable design is reflected in the building&#39;s energy-efficient lighting and heating systems, and through the intentional use of local materials, natural light and ventilation. An open floor plan enhances communication and a central courtyard and café create a sense of community.</p>
<p>Apart from seminar rooms, a computer lab and research suites, the complex also boasts four specialist clinics, including Audiology, Optometry, Occupational Medicine and Speech Language Therapy, which provide affordable healthcare to the public and a training ground for postgraduate students.</p>
<p>Research in areas such as public health, primary care and health information has been taking place at the University for a number of years, and the School of Population Health was established in July last year to bring together disciplines that were traditionally taught, researched and practiced in a variety of settings.</p>
<p>Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Time: 3.30pm, Tuesday, June 8, 2004 Venue: The University of Auckland Tamaki Campus Morrin Rd, Glenn Innes</p>
