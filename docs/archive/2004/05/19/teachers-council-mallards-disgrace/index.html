<p>Teachers Council, Mallard&#39;s Disgrace</p>
<p>Wednesday 19 May 2004</p>
<p>Deborah Coddington - Press Releases - Education</p>
<p>Education Minister Trevor Mallard&#39;s much vaunted Teachers Council is a disgrace, ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;At today&#39;s Education and Science Select Committee, MPs learned that - since being established in 2002 - the Teachers Council has managed to breach the Public Finance Act 1989; issued only a draft code of ethics; spat out its director Margaret Kouvelis; and burned up hundreds of thousands of taxpayers&#39; dollars,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard crowed that the Teacher Council would provide `leadership&#39; - something he claimed the old Teacher Registry Board didn&#39;t do. The push for the Teachers Council came from the teacher unions, annoyed that they had no representation on the Board.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we have another bureaucracy, with up to 17 council members representing everything from unions to Maori.</p>
<p>&quot;Remuneration for members, who meet up to three days a month, is $340 per meeting. The chair - Joanne Beresford - gets $540 a day. Labour man Stan Rodger has received nearly $24,000 in 17 months.</p>
<p>&quot;And what has been achieved? Teacher quality has not improved. Kura kaupapa teachers still aren&#39;t all registered. The only evidence produced for the Select Committee showing that the Council has actually done anything is a hazy draft code of ethics, written in such a way that you need a degree in bureaucratese to decide exactly what is good or bad teacher behaviour.</p>
<p>&quot;Once more, Mr Mallard has shown his incompetence as Education Minister. He&#39;s set the Teachers Council up to fail. Teachers who honour their profession should think carefully before giving Labour their vote at the next election,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
