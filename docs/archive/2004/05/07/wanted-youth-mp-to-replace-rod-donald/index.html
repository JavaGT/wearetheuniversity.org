<p>Wanted: Youth MP to replace Rod Donald</p>
<p>Green Party co-leader Rod Donald is advertising this weekend for someone to represent him at the 2004 Youth Parliament to be held in Wellington from 15-17 August.</p>
<p>Mr Donald is looking for a young person aged 16 to 18 who will be a first time voter at the next election. They need to live in Canterbury or Southland, which are the areas he represents for the Green Party.</p>
<p>The Youth Parliament provides 120 young New Zealanders with a once in a lifetime experience. For two days they will act like an MP, holding debates in the chamber, attending select committee meetings and dining at Bellamy&#39;s as well as touring Parliament buildings and learning all about the political process. Travel and accommodation are provided.</p>
<p>Rod Donald says he will even lend the successful candidate his matching tie and braces - whether they are male or female!</p>
<p>&quot;Becoming a Youth MP is an extraordinary opportunity to gain a taste of parliamentary life and the role MPs play in our democracy. It also reinforces the importance of participating in the political process.</p>
<p>&quot;As someone who first joined a political party at the age of 16 I would encourage any teenager interested in politics to take up this challenge. You never know where you might end up!&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Young people interested in applying should phone his parliament office collect on (04) 470 6663 for an application form. They will need to write a short essay as well as provide information about themselves and what they hope to achieve at the youth parliament. Applications close on Monday 17 May.</p>
