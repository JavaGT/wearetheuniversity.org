<p>Staff warn about lowering university degree standards</p>
<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) has warned against dropping the legislative requirement for degrees to be taught by people mainly engaged in research, saying that such a move would threaten the quality of New Zealand academic qualifications and the international reputation of New Zealand degrees.</p>
<p>The warning comes after the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) today released a consultation paper which questions whether the legislative requirement for research-based teaching for degrees should be reviewed. The consultation paper forms part of a part of a review into the future roles of tertiary education organisations (TEOs) in New Zealand.</p>
<p>AUS National President, Dr Bill Rosenberg, said that research-informed teaching was vital for undergraduate degrees. &quot;It is what distinguished degrees from other tertiary qualifications,&quot; he said. &quot;Any suggestion that standards for degree-teaching should be lowered contradicted the Government&#39;s intention to strengthen New Zealand&#39;s academic reputation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The results of the recent Performance-Based Research Funding (PBRF) assessment clearly showed that quality-research in this country&#39;s education institutions was limited to universities,&quot; said Dr Rosenberg. &quot;Poor PBRF results from the non-university institutions which teach degrees must not be used to justify lowering standards,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Despite concerns about the future of degree teaching, Dr Rosenberg said the proposed review of the future roles of TEOs was welcome. &quot;The competitive market system in education has failed, and it is increasingly clear that universities have certain roles that cannot and should not be filled by other education providers,&quot; he said. &quot;We support the need for greater differentiation between tertiary institutions. Each has a unique role and can complement, rather than compete against, each other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;AUS believes that the special role of universities, particularly in postgraduate research, needs not only to be recognized, but also adequately funded,&quot; said Dr Rosenberg.</p>
