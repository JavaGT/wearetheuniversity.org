<p>Our Elderly: How Do We Treat Them?</p>
<p>New Zealand First Deputy Leader, Peter Brown says he is concerned to learn how badly some elderly people are being treated in rest homes and also while receiving home care.</p>
<p>He said that a number of “quite distressing” cases in the Waikato region had been drawn to his attention.</p>
<p>“At this juncture it is not my intention to cause alarm as I have no doubt the vast majority of elderly folk are being treated well.</p>
<p>“However, to learn of even a few cases which clearly fit into the category of elder abuse, is sufficient to signal that there might be a need for a formal inquiry into just how we treat elderly people in this country.</p>
<p>“Waikato-based New Zealand First MP Barbara Stewart has also has been alerted to situations where elderly people appear to have been mistreated.</p>
<p>“People who share my concern should contact myself or Barbara Stewart. A simple letter to either of us at Parliament will suffice,” concluded Mr Brown.</p>
