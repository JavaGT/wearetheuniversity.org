<p>Time to give Zaoui his freedom</p>
<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) is calling on the Government to call it a day and give former Algerian academic Ahmed Zaoui his freedom. This follows the latest court decision, released last Friday, which follows a series of such decisions in Mr Zaoui&#39;s favour.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem the Government faces is that it now cannot win,&quot; says Dr Bill Rosenberg, AUS National President. &quot;The credibility of its case has been repeatedly tested and found unsupportable. From the Refugee Status Appeals Authority through multiple court decisions, judicial authorities have consistently rejected the Government&#39;s evidence and arguments. If Mr Zaoui&#39;s case goes through the full procedure of a review by the Inspector General of Security, followed by a Ministerial decision on the case, few will believe a decision that goes against Mr Zaoui. If the final decision is in his favour, people will demand to know why the Government persisted for so long at his expense. Any embarrassment the Government may suffer by dropping the case now will be far exceeded by the embarrassment if the case is taken to its bitter end.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the meantime, Mr Zaoui is under severe stress. It is simply inhumane to persevere with such a flimsy case. The government should use its power of discretion to release him immediately and confirm the refugee status given him by the Refugee Status Appeals Authority,&quot; said Dr Rosenberg.</p>
