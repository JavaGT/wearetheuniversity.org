<p>AUT to increase fees by $171 in 2005</p>
<p>The Council of Auckland University of Technology voted last night to increase tuition fees for domestic enrolments by $171 per student for 2005.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Derek McCormack said the modest increase was necessary to help ensure the University continued to meet the needs of students.</p>
<p>“Our fees are still among the lowest in the country. While the Council would prefer not to have to increase tuition fees, it is in no-one’s interest for the University to cut back on growth or reduce standards.</p>
<p>“Over the past four years AUT has been one of the fastest growing universities in the country. We are committed to a programme of development which will enable us to meet the needs of current and future students.”</p>
<p>Mr McCormack said that while the Council was reluctant to increase fees, it was more reluctant to reduce the value the University can deliver to students and stakeholders.</p>
<p>At the request of AUSM, AUT’s Students’ Association, the University has maintained a flat fee structure across all degrees. The 2004 student tuition fee is $3627 per annum and this will increase to $3798 for 2005, an increase of 4.7% on 2004.</p>
