<p>Government Fees Policy Fails Students: Fees Rise at AUT</p>
<p>“Labours fee maxima policy yesterday failed students at the Auckland University of Technology by leading to fee hikes for 2005,” said Elliot Roberts, President of the Auckland Student Movement at AUT (AuSM).</p>
<p>The Council voted in favour of a 4.7 percent fee rise despite pleas from student representatives that students could not afford to face fee increases again in 2005.</p>
<p>“The fee rise will mean students are plunged into even more student debt that will take even longer to repay and provide another reason for graduates to take their education and skills overseas.”</p>
<p>“The Government must take responsibility for their failed fee maxima policy and fix it to make sure that student fees start going down not up.”</p>
<p>“The fee increase is totally irresponsible given that AUT are wasting millions of dollars of student money on marketing campaigns that have little impact on where students decide to study,” said Roberts.</p>
<p>“The Government needs to take urgent action to stop institutions from constantly raising student fees well beyond what students and their families can afford.”</p>
<p>“AUT must join with students in sending a clear message to the government: lumping students and graduates with student debt is a recipe for social and economic disaster.”</p>
