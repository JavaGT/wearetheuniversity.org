<p>University of Canterbury sets tuition fees for 2005</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury Council has approved a 3.2 percent increase in tuition fees for 2005 for all but three of the University’s subject areas.</p>
<p>Of the major New Zealand universities which have so far raised their fees for next year, Canterbury University’s 3.2 percent increase is the lowest.</p>
<p>Fees for its Communication Disorders, Information Systems and Ecology and Conservation Studies programmes will increase by 5 percent to correct an historical anomaly (in one case) and ensure fee equity across all cost categories.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Sharp says the increases are needed to ensure that the University can continue high quality delivery of its services and meet the targets of its Financial Recovery Plan.</p>
<p>The plan was formulated to address financial problems which had developed over a decade of under-funding and fee restrictions.</p>
<p>After recording a $4.2 million operating deficit in 2001, the University last year recorded an operating surplus of $3.3 million.</p>
<p>Professor Sharp says this represented a significant turnaround within two years but was still too small in the context of the University’s $200 million budget.</p>
<p>The Council also approved the University’s 2005 Budget at its meeting today.</p>
<p>Professor Sharp says the Budget is well balanced to ensure that strategic momentum can be maintained within the framework of the University’s Financial Plan.</p>
