<p>Ahmed Zaoui Declared Spokesperson of Students</p>
<p>Today, in an historic vote, students’ voted for Ahmed Zaoui to be the Honorary Algerian Spokesperson of the Auckland University Students’ Association.</p>
<p>The meeting boasted a crowd of over 200 who heard the arguments and voted unanimously in favour of Zaoui.</p>
<p>“This vote shows that students are engaged with the world around them and that they will not stand for human rights abuses” AUSA President Kate Sutton said</p>
<p>Motion mover Eamonn Deverall said “Spokesman Zaoui’s present incarceration is only a temporary impediment to his regular attendance of AUSA meetings.”</p>
<p>“It is a shame that Mr Zaoui could not come to the meeting to speak to the motion but I will be contacting him to see what he has to say about Algerian Affairs on behalf of the students.” Sutton ended.</p>
<p>Chris Knox played to the students as a donation to the meeting of Zaoui supporters.</p>
