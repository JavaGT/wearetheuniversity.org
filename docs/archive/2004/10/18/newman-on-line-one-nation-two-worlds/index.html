<p>The Column: Newman On-Line: One Nation – Two Worlds  </p>
<p>This week, Newman On-Line reveals the Housing New Zealand Corporation’s ‘Two World View’, and outlines lengths the Government has gone to divide the nation.</p>
<p>I recently received documents under the Official Information Act, which outline the “two-world view” ideology underpinning the Housing New Zealand Corporation. The “Housing New Zealand Way” consists of a Maori world-view and a Crown world-view.</p>
<p>According to HNZ’s Chief Executive, the Two-World View:</p>
<p>“is based on an acknowledgement that the two Treaty partners have different ways of looking at the world including beliefs, values and experience. By looking from both of these perspectives we can develop a two-world view for the Corporation, which will underpin the way HNZC operates internally and the way we develop relationships externally.”</p>
<p>In her memo to staff, written after 14 senior managers had spent two days at a hui organised to develop a clearer approach to the Treaty and internal Maori capability, she states: “we are only at the beginning of a long and really interesting journey”.</p>
<p>This is a journey that has already cost taxpayers millions of dollars in consultants, meetings, hui, travel and accommodation, as well as race-based training and recruitment.</p>
<p>The base-line budget for advancing the two-world view is around $200,000 a year – but on top of that are marae costs, external facilitation and general expenses relating to kaumatua, advisors and special committees, which annually add hundreds of thousands of dollars more onto the cost.</p>

<p>Further, significant money is earmarked for Maori housing initiatives, including the Rural Housing Programme:</p>
<p>“capital expenditure over the life of the programme is planned to be approximately $100 million in addition to approximately $80 million operating expenditure”. Included in this programme are Maori in sub-standard houses who left urban areas to return to ancestral land but apparently “do not have enough money to buy or rent quality housing, or to maintain and repair existing housing to an acceptable standard”.</p>
<p>The Corporation expects 2,500 households to benefit over the next five years.</p>
<p>While I understand that a Two-World View methodology may be rife throughout the public service, the reality is that the vast majority of New Zealanders do not want a divided country. Instead, they want a nation that celebrates differences but unites us as one people working, living and playing together. The sort of racist, politically correct brainwashing being promoted by the Labour Government is the antithesis of that.</p>
<p>In the training materials, for example, the view is being promoted that – as a result of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi – Maori:</p>
<p>“might reasonably have expected” that “they would remain the majority, with an ongoing trickle of migrants rather than a flood” and that “the bulk of the country would still belong to the tribes, which would rule themselves as they wished, with some pakeha settlers there by agreement and observing Maori law”.</p>
<p>The staff training booklet goes on to describe what Maori actually got, including:</p>
<p>“the deliberate undermining and destruction of Maori authority and social systems; an imposed Pakeha government making laws for all without reference to Maori needs; discriminatory laws designed to transfer the land and resources to Pakeha and to deny Maori an effective voice; and widespread racial discrimination against them”.</p>
<p>Under the two-world view, Maori could look forward to:</p>
<p>“self-determination for Maori; return of Crown controlled resources unjustly alienated from Maori owners and negotiated compensation to Maori for such resources which are no longer in Crown control (does this mean all private assets?); and compensation for past and present dependency, poverty and discrimination by policies aimed at equity, including affirmative action in training, job appointments etc until there is real equity”.</p>
<p>While the Housing Minister has denied that all HNZC staff must go through these training programs, the OIA states that competence in this material:</p>
<p>“is a core requirement at least for all operational jobs, arguably for all jobs”. It explains that “as part of the selection process, internal candidates are expected to achieve a rating of at least 3 out of 5 and external candidates 4 out of 5”.</p>
<p>All of this flies in the face of public assurances by the Prime Minister and other Ministers that they are not giving special privilege to Maori. In reality, it means that, for the first time in public service history, we have a government that has introduced recruitment and promotion policies based on racial ideology: unless a staff member buys into the Labour Party’s Maori grievance world-view and politically correct agenda, they cannot work for HNZC.</p>
<p>The political correctness indoctrination is so advanced that the training manual has pages of “transformational vocabulary”, which states that certain words should not be used but should be replaced by others. For example: ‘confused’ should be replaced by ‘curious’, ‘afraid’ by ‘uncomfortable’, ‘furious’ by ‘passionate’, ‘disgusted’ by ‘surprised’, and if someone believes ‘it stinks’ then instead they must say ‘it is aromatic’, and if they are ‘pissed off’ instead they should be ‘tinkled’!</p>
<p>Labour’s Two-World View is promoting racial discrimination. Not only should it be immediately scrapped, but it would not surprise me to learn of staff members – or potential employees – who are taking claims to the Employment Court, because they had their reasonable career expectations curtailed through their failure to subscribe to the outrageous racial discrimination and re-writing of history being promoted by this government agency. If you know of anyone who is in this situation, please ask them to contact me.</p>
