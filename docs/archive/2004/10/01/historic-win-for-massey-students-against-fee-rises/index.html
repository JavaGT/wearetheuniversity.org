<p><strong>Friday, 1 October 2004, 2:09 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>

<p>Historic win for Massey students against fee rises must be followed by all tertiary institutions</p>
<p>Students are calling on all other tertiary institutions to follow the lead of the Massey University Council, who today voted against the University management’s proposal to raise fees by the maximum possible and resolved not to increase fees for 2005.</p>
<p>“All tertiary institutions in New Zealand should take a stand against the destructive impacts of student debt on our society and economy and vote against fee increases for 2005,” said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>“The Massey Council vote against the management of the University is an historic win for students who have been fighting for over a decade against management who bully Council members into voting for fee rises.”</p>
<p>“The message from the Massey Council to the government is clear: student debt is out of control and must be contained,” said Fitzsimons “It is now up to Government to start funding tertiary institutions adequately and start reducing student fees.”</p>
<p>“This vote against fee increases should be a precedent for other tertiary institutions who are setting fees in the coming weeks.”</p>
<p>“The message from students is clear: we cannot afford to face fee increases and borrow even more from the harsh student loan scheme.”</p>
