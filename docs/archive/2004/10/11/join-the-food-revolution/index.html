<p>Join the Food Revolution - change the world one bite at a time!<br>Invitation to a public meeting with Sue Kedgley MP and health campaigner and sports achiever Allison Roe</p>
<p>Date: Tuesday 19th October<br>Time: 7:00pm<br>Venue: Wellpark College of Natural Therapies, 6 Francis St, Grey Lynn</p>
<p>This is an invitation to attend a public meeting to find out what is in our food and what we can do to ensure the food we eat is SAFE -that is, sustainably produced, accurately labelled, drug-free and ethically marketed. The meeting will also explore how food and diet contribute to our health or ill-health, and what we need to do to improve the quality of the food we all eat.</p>
<p>The Green party has recently launched its &#39;Join the Food Revolution&#39; campaign to improve the quality of our food supply and put pressure on government to ensure that all food sold in New Zealand is sustainably produced, accurately labelled, drug free and ethically marketed.</p>
<p>The campaign encourages consumers to use their consumer and political pressure to push for proper labelling of GE foods, a ban on the routine feeding of antibiotics to animals which are not sick, mandatory country of origin labelling, a ban on the importation of irradiated food and on battery hen cages and many other issues.</p>
<p>Come along to this meeting to find out what you can do to help ensure our food is SAFE.</p>
