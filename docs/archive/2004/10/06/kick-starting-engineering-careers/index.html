<p>Kick starting engineering careers</p>
<p>The Faculty of Engineering at The University of Auckland is offering scholarships to help students kick start their engineering career.</p>
<p>Twenty-two Kick Start Scholarships are up for grabs for first year engineering students in 2005.</p>
<p>Dean of the Faculty of Engineering Professor Peter Brothers says the Kick Start Scholarships aim to make life easier for engineering students entering the university environment for the first time.</p>
<p>&quot;Beginning tertiary study can be daunting for some students and the Scholarships will go some way towards making this transition easier,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>The scholarships assist engineering students to overcome the potential financial barriers that they face when starting university. The grant of $2000 is expected to help with initial set-up costs such as textbooks, fees and accommodation.</p>
<p>There are three types of scholarships available:</p>
<p>* Kick Start Merit Scholarships<br>Eight scholarships which are awarded to the applicants with the best academic results in their final year of high school. These scholarships are open to students across New Zealand.</p>
<p>* Kick Start City of Sails Scholarships<br>Ten scholarships which are open to students who live outside the Auckland metropolitan area. This area is classified as north of Orewa or South of Drury.</p>
<p>* Kick Start Affirmative Action Scholarships<br>Four scholarships which are open to students of Maori or Pacific Island background.</p>
<p>Applications for the Kick Start Scholarships close on 7 January 2005. Details and applications can be obtained from school careers advisors or from the Faculty of Engineering website <a href="http://www.engineering.auckland.ac.nz">www.engineering.auckland.ac.nz</a> .</p>
