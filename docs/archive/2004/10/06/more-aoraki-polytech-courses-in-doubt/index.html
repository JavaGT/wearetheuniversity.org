<p><strong>Wednesday, 6 October 2004, 9:11 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>More Aoraki Polytech courses in doubt</p>
<p>National’s Education spokesman Bill English says Timaru people at a recent business lunch could be forgiven for believing they were filling out yet another Aoraki Polytechnic enrolment form.</p>
<p>“Some of the people who attended the lunch had also attended a Parenting with Confidence course where they had fill out an similar enrolment form.”</p>
<p>Aoraki has been enrolling people in a number of courses that would otherwise be unassociated with the Polytechnic.</p>
<p>Mr English says the Parenting with Confidence courses are just one example of many where the polytechnic appears to have enrolled participants in order to receive funding.</p>
<p>Parenting With Confidence Inc has provided parenting courses and seminars since 1994. These courses are usually organised by local voluntary committees.</p>
<p>Mr English says he has been contacted by a number of people in the area who have been enrolled as Aoraki polytechnic students when they attended community events. And he has evidence of more cases that he intends to follow-up.</p>
