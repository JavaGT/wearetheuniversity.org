<p>Students Voting With Their Feet Over NCEA</p>
<p>Monday 4 Oct 2004<br>Deborah Coddington<br>Press Releases -- Education</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today said she wasn&#39;t surprised that a growing number of students were deserting the NCEA and sitting Cambridge International Exams instead.</p>
<p>&quot;It was revealed at the Association of Cambridge Schools in New Zealand&#39;s annual conference, held over the weekend, that the number of students dumping the NCEA in favour of sitting Cambridge Exams has increased nearly 300 percent since 2002,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s little wonder the parents, teachers, schools and students are, in ever-increasing numbers, kicking the flawed NCEA to the curb. Unlike the NCEA - introduced by National, and implemented by Labour - the Cambridge Exam system is widely respected internationally, and by employers.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT would allow schools to retain the NCEA, take up the Cambridge Exams, or return to the gold-plated bursary system that had been such a success before Education Minister Trevor Mallard threw it out.</p>
<p>&quot;A return to national standards and external exams is crucial if our children are to reach their full potential, and if New Zealand&#39;s education system is to be the envy of the rest of the world,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
