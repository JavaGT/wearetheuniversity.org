<p>Hospital Waiting Lists Under Serious Pressure</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Health Spokesman Heather Roy today released new information revealing that hospitals throughout New Zealand were under-funded by $94.6 million in the year to June 2004</p>
<p>&quot;Figures obtained under the Official information Act show that, while total DHB deficits came to $58.3 million, the Hospital Provider Arms - the DHB branch responsible for providing hospital services - registered a $94.6 million shortfall,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is why Health Minister Annette King is hiding the real total waiting list numbers, and has avoided answering my questions for the past three months.</p>
<p>&quot;I recently revealed that, at the end of June 2004, over 56,000 people were booked for operations or on the Minister&#39;s Active Review - the waiting list to get on the waiting list. Ms King refuses to provide numbers of patients referred back to their GP.</p>
<p>&quot;Prospects are even worse, however, for the tens of thousands waiting for surgery to be performed this financial year. Contrary to the Minister&#39;s claims of huge cash injections into health for the 2004/05 year, 11 DHBs received less funding this year in inflation adjusted terms.</p>
<p>&quot;The truth is that Prime Minister Helen Clark&#39;s claimed $547 million increase for DHBs this year is nonsense. Of this, $218 million is to fund Disability Services (Aged Care) not previously DHBs&#39; responsibility - and the actual increase, of around $300 million, doesn&#39;t even match inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;The new confirmation that Hospital Provider Arms ran a $94 million deficit shows, once again, that hospitals and patients are paying the price of Labour&#39;s deception over health funding and waiting lists. Without doubt, this will become even worse this year,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
