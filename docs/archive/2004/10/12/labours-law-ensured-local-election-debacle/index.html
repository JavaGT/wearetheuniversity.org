<p>Labour&#39;s law ensured local election debacle</p>
<p>The debacle over the counting of thousands of STV votes was inevitable under Labour&#39;s complicated and confusing local electoral law changes, says National&#39;s Local Government spokesman, Dr Nick Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government must take responsibility for this mess. It is the kind of debacle we would expect in Third World countries - not New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour were so politically correct in rewriting the Local Electoral Act that they ended up with an unworkable mix of FPP, MMP-variant, and STV voting mechanisms, with each of the 84 councils running their own system.</p>
<p>&quot;On top of that, Labour required the newly established district health boards to abolish the ward system and replace it with STV for this election.</p>
<p>&quot;The chickens have come home to roost with an unprecedented low voter turnout, delayed results, a record high number of invalid votes, and now this counting debacle.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s policy is to implement one voting system for local elections. The system would be chosen after consultation with communities, and the decision would be based on maximising participation. A sophisticated system is useless if fewer people vote.</p>
<p>&quot;An inquiry is needed, not just into councils&#39; administration of the election, but also into the flawed legislation behind the mess&quot;, says Dr Smith.</p>
