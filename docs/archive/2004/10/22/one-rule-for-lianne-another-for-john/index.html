<p>Gerry Brownlee MP National Party Deputy Leader</p>
<p>22 October 2004</p>
<p>One rule for Lianne another for John</p>
<p>National Party Deputy Leader Gerry Brownlee says those seeking to defend John Tamihere are defending Helen Clark&#39;s ministerial double standard.</p>
<p>&quot;The evidence is already in on the key issue around this affair. Mr Tamihere took a golden handshake after saying he would not do so.</p>
<p>&quot;Only yesterday, the Education Minister said he regretted a golden handshake given to former Lincoln University head Frank Wood, which was made up of a mix of salary, contractual obligations and an ex-gratia payment.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Tamihere received a mix of salary, contractual obligations and an ex-gratia payment.</p>
<p>&quot;The terms of the golden handshake are almost identical, even though the circumstances are slightly different,&quot; says Mr Brownlee.</p>
<p>The Collins dictionary defines ex-gratia as: Given as a favour or gratuitously where no legal obligation exists.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Tamihere said he would not take a golden handshake and he did. Lianne Dalziel was caught out misleading the public and she was sacked. Helen Clark is accepting two standards.</p>
<p>&quot;At the last election Labour campaigned strongly against such payments, while Helen Clark promised higher standards of ministerial accountability and behaviour.</p>
<p>&#39;I give you my word tonight: that what we say we will do, we will do,&#39; she told voters.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark must keep those promises to the New Zealand public, even if her ministers will not. Mr Tamihere took a payment that he said he would not take and that should be enough for the Prime Minister to act decisively,&quot; says Mr Brownlee.</p>
