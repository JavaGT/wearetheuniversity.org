<p>Labour Day a Time for Work-Life Balance</p>
<p>Labour weekend was a good time to remember that most workers still struggled to balance the demands of work with the rest of their lives, Council of Trade Unions secretary Carol Beaumont said today.</p>
<p>On the first Labour Day trade union members marched to celebrate winning the eight-hour day.</p>
<p>“But today, for thousands of workers, the eight-hour day seems unachievable as they struggle with unreasonable workloads or are forced to put in long hours to survive on low hourly rates.”</p>
<p>Unions have pushed for gains for all workers – whether they are union members or not – in the history of this country’s development. The most recent victories are paid parental leave, four weeks’ annual leave and increased ability to bargain collectively.</p>
<p>“But there is still plenty to do to win work-life balance for the majority of the country’s workforce,” Carol Beaumont said.</p>
<p>Work-life balance depended on the fundamental aspects of decent work being in place.</p>
<p>&quot;Decent work is secure work, with reasonable working hours, good leave provisions, decent pay, supportive workplace cultures and access to quality, affordable child care.&quot;</p>
