<p><strong>Wednesday, 20 October 2004, 9:11 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Wairarapa Labour Candidate - Denise MacKenzie</p>
<p>The Labour candidate for the Wairarapa for the 2005 general election is Denise MacKenzie.</p>
<p>Announcing the candidacy today Labour Party President Mike Williams said that there were three top candidates making themselves available for selection but Denise Mackenzie stood out.</p>
<p>“It is important to have a candidate of Ms MacKenzies capabilities to keep driving the Labour Governments’ initiatives in the greater Wairarapa Region,” Mr Williams said. “There is the new hospital, education and training projects and the $26 million upgrade of the Wairarapa rail-link.</p>
<p>“In addition there is the delivery of broadband to all schools in the area plus the vast majority of local homes. That will help bring the area into the electronic age.”</p>
<p>Denise Mackenzie is a South Wairarapa special-needs teacher with a Bachelor of Arts degree.</p>
<p>She describes herself as loyal and committed and with a strong work ethic.</p>
<p>“I am totally committed to the Wairarapa electorate,” Ms MacKenzie said. “If elected my priorities will be to work with the Minister of Health to ensure our hospital goes according to plan and becomes a major asset for the region. In addition I want the strongest voice in Wellington for the issues facing education in the local area.</p>
<p>“Finally I would like to support the minister of Trade in his endeavours to ensure the continual well-being for the rural province that is the Wairarapa electorate,” said Ms MacKenzie</p>
<p>Personal Philosophy Loyalty, commitment and a determined work ethic are what I live by. There are few short cuts. I believe most achievements for ourselves and others are the result of patience and hard work. I want to work hard for the people of the Wairarapa and the NZ Labour Party.</p>

<p>Issues around equity are important. The playing field is rarely level and the achievers in our society have a role in helping others who have less advantage to live full and happy lives. Success does not have to result in selfishness or the promotion of self-interest.</p>
<p>I have a strong commitment to team work and believe that as a community we should work collaboratively and collectively to make things better. By listening and understanding another’s point of view, and presenting our own well supported position, we can often reconcile conflict and all achieve success.</p>
<p>Education is the key to success and everyone is entitled to receive quality learning experiences. I believe that I have the right education and background to represent the people of this electorate.</p>
