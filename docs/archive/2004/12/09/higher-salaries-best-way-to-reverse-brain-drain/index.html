<p><strong>Thursday, 9 December 2004, 11:41 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Higher salaries best way to reverse brain drain</p>
<p>National Party Leader Don Brash says higher salaries and a better standard of living are easily the best ways to reverse the brain drain affecting New Zealand, and taxes are a big part of that.</p>
<p>“If our best and brightest were rewarded with significantly higher salary packets under National’s high-growth economy, fewer of them would be looking to permanently leave this country for greener pastures.”</p>
<p>Dr Brash is commenting in the wake of statistics this week which show one in five New Zealand-born graduates head overseas as soon as they get their degree and a survey that shows pay rises in New Zealand are lagging well behind Australia.</p>
<p>According to a survey by Mercer Human Resources Consulting, Kiwi white-collar workers can expect one of the smallest pay rises in the world over the next year, despite New Zealand&#39;s buoyant economy.</p>
<p>“Sure, many of our young people come back having done their O.E, with valuable skills and experience, but not enough are coming back for good.</p>
<p>“If you look back over the past 12 years, about 60 per cent of those who took out student loans and left New Zealand have yet to return.</p>
<p>“The only way we’ll get them back is if wage rates grow significantly and we increase our national productivity.</p>
<p>“We can’t do that when the Government continues to impose barriers to business, such as employment laws that put too much power in the hands of unions and limit choice for individuals.</p>
<p>“Labour’s big government ideology is undoubtedly harming our wage growth potential.</p>

<p>“At the same time the Government continues to amass large surpluses while rejecting the demands from all workers for tax relief.</p>
<p>“National supports a fairer tax system that rewards hard work, enterprise and innovation, rather than punishes people for it.</p>
<p>“If we want our bright young graduates to come back, we have to give them a good reason to return. Higher wages and salaries for everyone would be a great start,” says Dr Brash.</p>
