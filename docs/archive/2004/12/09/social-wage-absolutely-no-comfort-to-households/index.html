<p>Social wage absolutely no comfort to households</p>
<p>Thursday 9 Dec 2004</p>
<p>Rodney Hide - Press Releases - Economy</p>
<p>Dr Cullen&#39;s spin that the average New Zealand household can take much satisfaction from the fact that &quot;the social wage has increased&quot; is laughable, ACT Leader Rodney Hide today.</p>
<p>&quot;The reality is the average household is no better off in real terms than it was when Labour came to power. In fact the Government is taking nearly $3,000 extra in real terms out of each household.&quot;</p>
<p>On Tuesday in the House, Dr Cullen confirmed that in real terms the average household net income after direct taxation is no better than it was four years ago.</p>
<p>Today in the House Dr Cullen confirmed that the average household in real terms actually now pays &quot;$2,910&quot; more in direct and indirect taxes than was the case in the 1999/2000 financial year.</p>
<p>&quot;The average household&#39;s ability to make ends meet has eroded substantially with this greedy Government increasing taxes every year.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s an insult that Dr Cullen now implies no one&#39;s too worried because his so-called social wage has increased. He&#39;s talking about our education and healthcare services improving and he&#39;s dreaming. The reality is thousands of New Zealanders continue to wait and die on the waiting lists and our education standards are at an all-time low.</p>
<p>&quot;Kiwis will be perplexed to hear Dr Cullen&#39;s new excuse for stagnant net incomes. He says forget what you&#39;re being paid, look at your social wage! The reality is Kiwis want pay rises from tax cuts. They are sick of being squeezed,&quot; Mr Hide said.</p>
