<p><strong>Wednesday, 1 December 2004, 11:20 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Incompetent teachers will be registered</p>
<p>The Education Review Office confirmed today that new teachers it regards as ineffective are likely to be registered anyway, says National’s Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, an ERO investigation found that one third of second-year primary and half of second-year secondary teachers are not effective.</p>
<p>ERO officials at a select committee hearing this morning confirmed the likelihood that the Teachers Council will register these teachers.</p>
<p>Mr English says it’s scandalous that these teachers will be at the head of the classroom when the Government’s own officials have said they aren’t up to it.</p>
<p>“The Minister of Education and his officials are sitting on their hands while hundreds of teachers, who aren’t up to the job, are officially given the right to teach our children.”</p>
<p>“Parents have the right to expect that the person responsible for their child’s education will be competent and effective.</p>
<p>“If these ineffective teachers are in front of classes next year, about 20,000 students will have their education blighted. The Minister and the Teachers Council must move urgently to protect these young New Zealanders,” says Mr English.</p>
