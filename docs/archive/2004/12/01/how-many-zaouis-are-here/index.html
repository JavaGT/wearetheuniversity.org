<p>How Many Zaouis Are Here?</p>
<p>New Zealand First has called on the Government to explain why nearly a thousand foreigners with false, lost or destroyed travel documents have been allowed into the country since January 2001.</p>
<p>The Immigration Minister has revealed to spokesperson Dail Jones that 966 people came into New Zealand between 1 January 2001 and 30 September 2004 with false, lost or destroyed documents.</p>
<p>“This is an extraordinary situation,” said Mr Jones. “Nearly a thousand Zaouis have been allowed into New Zealand in that time and the Minister advises that 438 of them had been found to be refugees.</p>
<p>“If some of the previous decisions of refugee appeal authorities are anything to go by, we simply have no idea of who has come amongst us, no doubt bringing in all their relations.</p>
<p>“Perhaps the Minister could also explain where the other 528 arrivals have gone. Are they still in New Zealand living off the taxpayers or have they been kicked out?</p>
<p>“Too many people are coming here without documentation because they know that New Zealand is now the softest touch for refugees and asylum seekers in the developed world.</p>
<p>“Stricter systems for entry to New Zealand are well overdue. The security of this country and its people are threatened by such lax border controls,” said Mr Jones.</p>
