<p>RMA changes offer no respite for small business</p>
<p>Thursday 2 Dec 2004</p>
<p>Ken Shirley - Press Releases - Environment &amp; Conservation</p>
<p>The Labour Government&#39;s amendments to the RMA introduced today are a backward step and an affront to the many small and medium sized businesses that have been battling the Act for 15 years, ACT Conservation and Environment spokesman Ken Shirley said today.</p>
<p>&quot;In essence, the Government is saying that it has taken upon itself more centralised control with fast track measures to facilitate its own infrastructural needs, while saying to everyone else `you can continue to run the gauntlet&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Recently the Environment Minister described the RMA as beautifully worded and beautifully crafted. Whereas in reality it is fundamentally flawed and is the biggest obstacle to investment in this country.</p>
<p>&quot;Large infrastructural utilities are important for our economy, but our prosperity is made up by all components with the thousands of small businesses collectively providing the bulk of employment opportunities and supply of goods and services.</p>
<p>&quot;The very issues that have caused the Government to take on this `think big&#39; approach for its publicly-owned utilities are the same obstacles and hindrances that will continue to confront all other components of the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Our planning laws should be neutral rather than providing special fast track provisions for publicly-owned infrastructural utilities,&quot; Mr Shirley said.</p>
