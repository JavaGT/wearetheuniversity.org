<p>Better late than never, says Coddington</p>
<p>Thursday 2 Dec 2004</p>
<p>Deborah Coddington - Press Releases - Education</p>
<p>&quot;Better late than never&quot; was ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington&#39;s reaction to Trevor Mallard&#39;s decision to allow the Secretary for Education the discretion to extend provisional early childhood centre licences from three months to 12.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard has clearly bowed to pressure from thousands of parents, and the early childhood sector, which watched with interest the case of the tiny Kawhia preschool which had to fight through the Hamilton High Court to stop the Minister from closing its centre,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;Kawhia should take a bow. It fought city hall and has scored a partial victory.</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard must apologise to the thousands of parents, teachers, and children who have faced months of uncertainty because of his draconian legislation which, among other things, says primary teachers can&#39;t be responsible for running an early childhood centre.</p>
<p>&quot;This flip flop, while welcomed, smacks of desperation from a Minister who was facing the real prospect of up to 400 early childhood centres around New Zealand closing their doors. However, in another 12 months - conveniently after the next election - this problem will raise its ugly head again.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT would give back to parents and communities the responsibility of deciding who is capable of running their early childhood centres and dump this Minister&#39;s obsession with one-size-fits-all education,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
