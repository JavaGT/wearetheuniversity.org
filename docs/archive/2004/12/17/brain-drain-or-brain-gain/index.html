<p>Brain drain or brain gain?</p>
<p>Results of a survey conducted by the New Zealand Vice Chancellor&#39;s Committee show that, despite the student loans scheme, only around six percent of university students leave New Zealand immediately after they graduate, ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>The survey was sent to 28,973 students, including 3,473 international students, who graduated from a New Zealand university in 2003.</p>
<p>&quot;Of 10,136 graduates who responded to the 2004 survey carried out by New Zealand&#39;s eight universities, only 586 were overseas six months after graduation,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;The good news is that 59 percent of graduates had gained full-time employment in New Zealand. A further 23 percent continued on with their studies in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;Of the 586 &#39;brains&#39; who&#39;d &#39;drained&#39;, 365 were in full-time work overseas, 81 were studying full-time at overseas&#39; institutions, and 88 were just travelling.</p>
<p>&quot;We hear anecdotal scare stories about the so-called &#39;brain drain&#39; caused by student debt but this survey shows that, at least with university graduates, the greater majority do stay in New Zealand after graduation.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT has always harboured doubts that our &#39;best and brightest&#39; graduates were abandoning New Zealand. Talk like that implies that only the losers stay behind. This survey throws some light on a debate that, until now, has largely generated only heat,&quot; Miss Coddington said.  </p>
