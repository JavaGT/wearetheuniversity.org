<p>Education race-based funding alive &amp; well</p>
<p>Despite Trevor Mallard&#39;s announcement yesterday that the Maori weighting for decile funding will be abolished, there is still a plethora of race-based funding in education, ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The Education Ministry&#39;s Annual Report 2004 states in Appendix 1 that more than $500 million has been spent on &#39;reducing inequalities programmes by ethnic group and outcome&#39;,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;By ACT&#39;s calculations, about a quarter of a billion dollars of this funding - 42 percent - has been spent on Maori and Pacific Island students. These children make up just 28 percent of students across the entire education sector, tertiary included.</p>
<p>&quot;Programmes include money spent on things like &#39;Maori parenting&#39;, &#39;Maori youth mentoring&#39;, &#39;scholarships and bursaries&#39;, &#39;Maori teacher supply&#39;, &#39;addressing workload issues for Maori teachers&#39; and &#39;iwi education partnerships&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT acknowledges that Maori and Pacific children are grossly over-represented in the under-achievement stakes, but throwing money at projects like these just doesn&#39;t lift the literacy and numeracy levels of those students.</p>
<p>&quot;The best education for Maori children - or any children who are failing - would be to let the funding follow the child, introduce a little competition so good teachers can be paid top salaries, and re-introduce national testing to ensure children pass one level before they are moved on to the next.</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard has still got a long way to go when it comes to ending race-based funding - a promise the Labour Government made nearly 12 months ago,&quot; Miss Coddington said.  </p>
