<p>Maharey backs down part of the way</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman, Bill English, says Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey has backed down part of the way over Canterbury Polytechnic’s COOL-IT enrolment scandal.</p>
<p>He is commenting on a report that the Tertiary Education Commission has decided to withhold a $5 million payment from the polytech for half of the 13,000 students who enrolled in the COOL-IT course but did not finish it.</p>
<p>“Something needed to happen about those bogus enrolments, and the Minister has backed down part of the way. But he has created confusion about what he is doing.</p>
<p>“TEC says is it holding back money, but that is money that was paid to CPIT 12 months ago. Any money the Government withholds now will be funding for legitimate courses, and all polytechs will be concerned that the Government is doing this.</p>
<p>Mr English says it is not clear why Mr Maharey is not holding back all the money instead of just half.</p>
<p>“He has procrastinated for so long over this issue that we will not believe he is doing anything till we see the cash.</p>
<p>“The Minister made it clear in the House today that he thinks CPIT has failed to meet expectations of public accountability.</p>
<p>“As such he must do something about the personnel who have shown that lack of accountability and fire John Scott,” Mr English says.</p>
