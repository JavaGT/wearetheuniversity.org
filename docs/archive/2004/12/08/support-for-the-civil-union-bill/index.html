<p>Queer Students And Their Friends Show Support For The Civil Union Bill</p>
<p>UniQ, the representative group for queer students at Victoria University, in conjunction with their umbrella association VUWSA, will host a final show of support at Parliament tomorrow as the Civil Union Bill is voted on for the last time.</p>
<p>UniQ Co-President AJ Marsh invites all supporters of the Bill to come along and await the final vote, which should take place around 4.30pm.</p>
<p>“We encourage people to bring their lunch, enjoy the music and speeches, and play a little soccer in a queer and family friendly environment” said Mr Marsh today.</p>
<p>“While groups opposing the Bill may be considering a silent vigil, people who have not had legal recognition of their relationships have been silent long enough – we are confident the Bill will go through and it will be the culmination of many years of hard work by people who recognise the pre-eminence of human rights in New Zealand” said Marsh.</p>
<p>There will be music and speeches from 11.30am tomorrow, December 9th, on Parliament grounds.</p>
