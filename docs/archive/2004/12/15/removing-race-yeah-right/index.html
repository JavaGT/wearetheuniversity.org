<p><strong>Wednesday, 15 December 2004, 3:41 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Bill English - National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>15 December 2004</p>
<p>Removing race? Yeah, right</p>
<p>Trevor Mallard&#39;s suggestion that he has removed the racial component of early childhood funding is nothing but smoke and mirrors, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English. Mr Mallard announced today that separate contestable funding pools, based on race, would be scrapped in favour of one general pool. &quot;It&#39;s not the name of the funding pool that counts, but the way decisions are made about who gets funding and at what level.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr English has obtained a copy of the &#39;matrix&#39; used for the prioritisation process for applications to the current general funding pools</p>
<p>The document states that race is a factor used to help prioritise applications and &#39;the highest value will go to those groups that provide the highest amount of new places for Maori and Pasifika children&#39; and for the &#39;retention of Pasifika children&#39;. It explicitly states that this is &#39;aligned with Government policy&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;This makes it very clear that race remains a decisive factor in funding decisions, and will remain so despite Trevor Mallard&#39;s announcement that the funding pools are to be reshuffled.</p>
<p>&quot;My office has been contacted by a number of childcare centres around the country who have missed out on funding because they didn&#39;t have &#39;enough&#39; Maori and Pasifika students to qualify, despite the fact that they were applying to &#39;general&#39; funding pools. &quot;Volunteer mothers and fathers raise thousands of dollars for early childhood centres and deserve more honesty about the criteria for government funding,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
