<p>Hon Bill English - National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>15 December 2004</p>
<p>Maharey plays on as ship goes down</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English, says Steve Maharey should face the music and realise that his tertiary strategy has been a $1.54 billion failure.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government&#39;s &#39;Retention, Completion and Progression in Tertiary Education&#39; report tells a sorry story about the state of certificate and diploma courses.&quot;</p>
<p>The report finds that of the students commencing study in 2000, after three years: o 70% of students studying towards a diploma had not completed study. o 72% of students studying towards a certificate had not completed study.</p>
<p>Over the past four years the Government has spent over $2.2 billion on these courses.</p>
<p>Mr English says the 70% non-completion rate effectively means $1.54 billion has been wasted.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister&#39;s attempts to rebut fundamental facts show that once again he is unwilling to clean up his own mess.</p>
<p>&quot;Schools are crying out for more money at a time when the Minister is wasting hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
