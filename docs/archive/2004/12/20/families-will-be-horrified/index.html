<p>Bill English National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>20 December 2004</p>
<p>Families will be horrified</p>
<p>The families of school children should be horrified at the elevation of David Benson-Pope to the Education portfolio, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the man who is on record as saying that sexually active 12-year-old girls are women.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark had no choice but to remove Trevor Mallard from being in charge of schools after his disastrous schools closure programme and his subsequent U-turns, but it is a pity she didn&#39;t go the whole way and sack him completely from the portfolio.</p>
<p>Mr English also says Steve Maharey&#39;s sacking from tertiary education is just desserts for the mess he made.</p>
<p>&quot;His stewardship has been a disaster, with hundreds of millions of dollars wasted on courses that no one did. His policies were unsustainable and his credibility was shot.&quot;</p>
