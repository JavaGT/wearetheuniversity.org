<p>Mrs Austin will remain a Council member until the end of January, by which time she will have completed 10 years’ service, spread over two periods of appointment.</p>
<p>A Bachelor of Agricultural Commerce graduate of Lincoln University (1980) and a Kellogg Rural Leadership Scholar (1995), Mr Lambie has been National President of Federated Farmers since 2002. He was National Vice-President from 1996-2002 and is a past South Canterbury Provincial President.</p>

<p>Also elected today is a new Pro-Chancellor (deputy to the Chancellor). Mr Don Couch of Lyttelton succeeds Ms Charlotte Williams of Wellington who has been Pro-Chancellor since 2002 and also held the position in the early 1990s during Lincoln’s first years as an autonomous university.</p>
<p>Mr Couch is deputy kaiwhakahaere (chairman) of Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu. He has been the Rapaki representative on the Runanga for six years and spent 30 years in Canada working in management roles in tertiary education. On the motion of Ms Williams the Council carried a unanimous acknowledgement of Mrs Austin’s contributions to Lincoln University and her dedication to education in general.</p>
