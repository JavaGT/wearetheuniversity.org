<p>New officers for Victoria University Council</p>
<p>The Council of Victoria University of Wellington has today appointed two new officers to lead it in the New Year.</p>
<p>The Council today appointed Emeritus Professor Tim Beaglehole as Chancellor and Ian McKinnon as Pro Chancellor, effective from 1 January 2005.</p>
<p>The Chancellor chairs the University Council, has a casting vote on tied issues and is responsible for providing leadership to Council in the execution of its governance responsibilities. As the University&#39;s ceremonial head, the Chancellor also presides at graduation ceremonies and, on behalf the Council, confers degrees. The Pro Chancellor is the Council&#39;s deputy chairperson and deputises for the Chancellor when required.</p>
<p>Professor Beaglehole, who has a Master of Arts degrees from the University of New Zealand and Cambridge University and a PhD from Cambridge, has had a long association with Victoria University as a student and member of the staff. He was a staff representative on the Victoria University Council, 1968-71 and 1982, and since 1999, has been a representative of alumni on the Council.</p>
<p>Professor Beaglehole was formerly a staff member of the former History Department, Warden of Weir House, Dean of Arts, and Deputy Vice-Chancellor and is a life member of the Victoria University of Wellington Students&#39; Association. For over thirty years he was responsible for building the University’s collection of works of art. He was a Harkness Fellow at Harvard, 1965-66, and taught at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, 1978.</p>

<p>Mr McKinnon&#39;s career has been in the independent school sector. He first taught at King&#39;s College in Auckland, where he was also a boarding housemaster, and then at Eton College in the UK, where he subsequently returned as Lower Master, i.e. Deputy Headmaster, in 1988.</p>
<p>He was Headmaster of Wanganui Collegiate School (1980–1988) and of Scots College (1992-2002).
