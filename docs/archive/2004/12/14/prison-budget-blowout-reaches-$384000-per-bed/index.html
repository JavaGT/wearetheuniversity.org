<p>Dr Paul Hutchison MP for Port Waikato</p>
<p>14 December 2004</p>
<p>Prison budget blowout reaches $384,000 per bed</p>
<p>&quot;A Government budget blowout at Springhill Prison amounts to prison beds costing four times that of beds in nursing homes,&quot; says local MP Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;The total cost of the prison has risen from $188 million to $250 million - that equates to $384,000 per prison bed. When compared to the $90,000 for a bed in a nursing home it shows just how excessive the spending has become.&quot;</p>
<p>The prison site was bought for $2.3 million, but in June, Corrections Minister Paul Swain revealed earth-moving would cost $28 million. Now that figure has sky-rocketed to $38.8 million, including an extraordinary $7.7 million spent buying 11 dump trucks.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a massive cost that could have been avoided had the Government chosen a more appropriate site from the 46 available,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;While the Government&#39;s mean policies have driven the Salvation Army to stop operating nursing homes, the Government are happy to waste millions of dollars because of poor planning.</p>
<p>&quot;The excessive, sloppy spending is an insult to the thousands of elderly people who live in insecurity in their nursing home beds which cost a quarter of those at the Springhill Prison,&quot; Dr Hutchison says.</p>
