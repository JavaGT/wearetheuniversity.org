<p>Hon Bill English - National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>14 December 2004</p>
<p>Maharey throws away $1.54 billion</p>
<p>A Government report showing that 70% of students enrolled in sub-degree tertiary courses will never finish them confirms that Steve Maharey has wasted $1.54 billion, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>The Tertiary Education Sector Profile and Trends report shows that after five years:</p>
<p>· Only 27% of students studying for a diploma have completed it.</p>
<p>· Only 23% of students studying for a level 4 certificate have completed it.</p>
<p>· Only 33% of students studying for a level 1-3 certificate have completed it.</p>
<p>Mr English says a 70% non-completion rate is scandalous.</p>
<p>Sub-degree level courses generally take less than five years, and investment in this area has almost doubled under the Labour Government.</p>
<p>When Steve Maharey launched the Tertiary Education Commission he said it would &#39;bring clear strategic direction to the system as a whole&#39; and would ensure that &#39;student enrolments are concentrated in areas of high performance and high strategic relevance&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless his strategy was a 70% failure rate, this report makes an absolute mockery of that statement and of the Minister,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;The individuals are wasting their money by paying for these courses if they&#39;re not going to complete them, which is their loss, but 70% of the $2.2 billion tertiary education budget has also been hosed away, and the Minister must be held accountable.&quot;</p>
