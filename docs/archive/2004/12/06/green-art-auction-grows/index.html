<p>Green art auction grows</p>
<p>Over 90 artworks will now feature in &quot;The Great Art Auction&quot; to be held in Christchurch on Sunday 12 December.</p>
<p>The event has been organised by the Banks Peninsula Green Party as an election campaign fundraiser.</p>
<p>Notable artists include Bill Hammond, Neil Dawson, Bing Dawe and Tony de Lautour. Altogether 60 artists have submitted work for auction, including several graduating fine arts students from Canterbury.</p>
<p>&quot;We thought that holding an auction might be a good idea after two supportive artists offered to donate an artwork each to help with my next campaign,&quot; said Green MP Rod Donald. &quot;But I never expected it would grow into the major event that it has become.</p>
<p>&quot;Our website <a href="http://www.thegreatartauction.org.nz">http://www.thegreatartauction.org.nz</a> is attracting a lot of interest, with 69 artworks from 55 artists already available for viewing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>While a number of works have been donated, including three artist&#39;s proofs from Bill Hammond, most of the art is being auctioned on commission.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s great to be able to support the artistic community, especially the young graduates who have submitted work that is well worth collecting.</p>
<p>&quot;The Great Hall of the Arts Centre is a fitting venue and with &#39;this is your life&#39; Bob Parker as MC and professional auctioneer Bryan Andrews taking the bids it will certainly be &#39;the great art auction&#39;!&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The artworks go on show from 2pm with free viewing and a silent auction until 5pm. The doors reopen at 6pm for live entertainment and refreshments and the live auction commences at 7pm.</p>
<p>Evening entry is by ticket only - door sales $10, pre-sales $8 (available from the Arts Centre Information Centre or the Green Room, 16 Bedford Row).  </p>
