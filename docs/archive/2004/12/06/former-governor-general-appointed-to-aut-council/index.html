<p>“I’m delighted to accept AUT’s invitation to join the governing Council,” said Sir Paul. “I believe the University has a unique and distinct contribution to make to New Zealand and I am excited by the prospect of playing an active role in that.”</p>
<p>The University’s Chancellor Wyn Hoadley welcomed Sir Paul’s acceptance and paid tribute to Rod Gates.</p>
<p>“Sir Paul Reeves will be a tremendous asset to AUT and we are excited to have him join our Council. Rod Gates has been a staunch supporter of the Auckland University of Technology for many years. As Pro Chancellor, Rod has been a tremendous support to me and on behalf of the Council I wish him well.”</p>
<p>The Auckland University of Technology is the country’s fourth largest and most contemporary university. Its unique profile reflects its history and innovative approaches to teaching, learning and research.
