<p><strong>Monday, 6 December 2004, 11:25 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party">The Maori Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Maori and Student Debt Tariana Turia, Co-leader, Maori Party</p>
<p>‘The announcement that Maori students now owe more than $1billion in student loans is of great concern to the Maori Party’ said Tariana Turia, co-leader of the Maori Party.</p>
<p>The Mâori Party acknowledges the unacceptable levels of student debt and is committed to addressing the burden of debt on students and their whanau.</p>
<p>‘We are delighted to be working with Te Mana Akonga, National Maori Tertiary Students Association, to discuss workable solutions for a situation of such national significance’.</p>
<p>‘The crisis of financial burden placed on Maori students and their whanau must be faced by policy makers, politicians and planners, if we are serious about their future in our nation’ said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>‘Front-end investment in tertiary education should enable tangata whenua to continue to achieve high standards of scholarship and intellectual endeavour without being saddled with a life long liability to the state’.</p>
<p>‘To this end, we welcomed the initiative by Te Mana Akonga, to hold a Maori Student Debt Summit today and we will be pleased to work together with other political parties, to discuss debt solutions’ said Mrs Turia today.</p>
<p>MÄORI PARTY</p>
<p>Education Policy</p>
<p>1.0 The proposition</p>
<p>We assume that:</p>
<p>As a Country we seek to achieve and maintain for all of our citizens the highest achievable level of wellbeing in all of its aspects;</p>
<p>The Nation is particularly mindful of the wellbeing of the more vulnerable of the two signatories to Te Tiriti o Waitangi/The Treaty of Waitangi, namely, the tangata whenua of this Land;</p>
<p>Advertisement - scroll to continue reading</p>
<p>The tangata whenua are determined to survive and prosper as a people and fulfil their obligations to all of the other citizens of this Country;</p>
<p>As a Nation we seek to be a respected member of the international community.</p>
<p>We believe that</p>
<p>1.5 The better informed and educated are our citizens the higher our chances of fulfilling the Nation’s aspirations.</p>
<p>The Te Tiriti o Waitangi/The Treaty of Waitangi</p>
<p>This document traces its whakapapa from He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni/The Declaration of Independence, an understanding consummated in 1835 between King William VI and Mäori, particularly those representing the northern parts of Te Ika a Mäui. It was in the nature of a nation-to-nation arrangement. Subsequently, in 1840, a partnership between kawanatanga and tino rangatiratanga was agreed between the Crown and the Tangata Whenua.</p>
<p>Te Tiriti o Waitangi/The Treaty of Waitangi embodies the principles of two sets of cultural development based on the two signatories, partnership between kawanatanga and tino rangatiratanga and equality of rights and privileges between the citizens associated with the two signatories.</p>
<p>The educational policies of the Mäori Party anticipate the full expression of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/The Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
<p>On education and wellbeing</p>
<p>For the citizens of this Country, being well informed and educated, will include being able to</p>
<p>articulate our aspirations as a Nation and the respective roles of the tangata whenua and of all other citizens in the fulfilment of these;</p>
<p>interpret and explain the Nation’s evolving understanding of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/The Treaty of Waitangi and of its distinctive contribution to our affairs; and,</p>
<p>grow in their understanding of themselves and continue to fulfil the promises and principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/The Treaty of Waitangi in the midst of changing circumstances within and beyond our shores.</p>
<p>To maximise their contribution to the comprehensive wellbeing of the Nation, our citizens will engage with global intellectual activity in all its forms and locations.</p>
<p>As a Nation we look to having education policies that are</p>
<p>designed to maximise the benefits to the Nation of the resources committed to education; and</p>
<p>As a Nation we demonstrate our willingness to share</p>
<p>intellectual property including systems, content and methodologies that will result in this Country optimising the benefits for the Nation of resources committed to education.</p>

<p>made available to limit the level of student debt to its present level;</p>

<p>4.72 That within a period of five years the proportion of the Nation’s contribution to research from the public purse to the broadening and deeping of the mätauranga continuum of the less numerous signatory to the Tiriti/Treaty be determined by the proportion of the population represented by the tangata whenua signatory to the Treaty plus provision for the under-funding of this partner in recent years.</p>
