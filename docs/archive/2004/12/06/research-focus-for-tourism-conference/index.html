<p>Research focus for tourism conference</p>
<p>Research and the role that it plays in New Zealand&#39;s economy and society is the focus of a major conference on tourism to be held at Rutherford House (23 Lambton Quay) this week.</p>
<p>Organised by the Tourism Group in Victoria University&#39;s Victoria Management School, the theme of the fifth biennial New Zealand Tourism and Hospitality Research Conference, which runs from December 8-10, is &quot;tourism research: advances and applications.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Adam Weaver, Lecturer in Tourism Management, says many of the 95 papers at the conference will address recent advances in tourism and hospitality research.</p>
<p>Tourism makes important contributions to the New Zealand economy; it creates employment, generates foreign exchange earnings and attracts investment. Tourism has become one of the country’s most prominent industries and is responsible for almost 10 percent of New Zealand&#39;s GDP.</p>
<p>Research is critical to understanding the current state of the industry. Research findings are useful to policymakers, business owners, educators and members of the wider community.</p>
<p>Dr Weaver says conference sessions will address a wide array of themes and topics: planning and management, sustainability, tourism education, risk, entrepreneurship, and wine tourism. Delegates include tourism and hospitality researchers from New Zealand and 15 other countries.</p>
<p>The Minister of Tourism, Hon Mark Burton, will open the conference at 9am on December 8 and host a reception for delegates at Parliament in the evening.</p>
