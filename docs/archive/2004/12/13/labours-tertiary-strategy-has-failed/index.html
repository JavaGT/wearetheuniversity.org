<p><strong>Monday, 13 December 2004, 8:16 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour’s tertiary strategy has failed</p>
<p>A Government report on tertiary education shows that five years of talking and millions of dollars in bureaucracy costs have been wasted on trying to change tertiary education.</p>
<p>“When parents of school children are selling raffle tickets to employ teachers, this waste of hundreds of millions of dollars is a scandal,” Mr English says.</p>
<p>“Five years ago, Steve Maharey said he would line up tertiary education with the Government’s priorities. He has – political correctness and wasted taxpayer money.</p>
<p>“Self-esteem courses, dodgy computer training and low-level cultural courses account for most of the increase in student numbers and spending.</p>
<p>“This year has been a rolling scandal of revelations about expensive courses on radio and CDs, thousands of enrolled students failing to complete courses, and a blow-out in spending on low-value courses like twilight golf and coffee-making.</p>
<p>“The report shows that only 43% of students who started a bachelor’s degree in 1999 finished it by the end of 2003.</p>
<p>“The Tertiary Education Commission, costing $47 million per year, was meant to increase the proportion of students completing their courses, and again they have failed,” Mr English says.</p>
