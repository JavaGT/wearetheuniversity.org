<p>Hodgson&#39;s attack on Putin advisor unfortunate</p>
<p>Wednesday 22 Dec 2004</p>
<p>Ken Shirley - Press Releases - Environment &amp; Conservation</p>
<p>Climate Change Minister Pete Hodgson&#39;s attack on Andrey Illarionov, key advisor to Russian President Vladimir Putin, is at best unfortunate and a sad reflection on the Minister, ACT Environment and Energy spokesman Ken Shirley said today.</p>
<p>&quot;In particular Mr Hodgson criticised Mr Illarionov&#39;s views that carbon dioxide levels rose after temperature rises. The Minister labels these views as approximately illiterate,&quot; Mr Shirley said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Hodgson should be aware, but possibly isn&#39;t, that established climate data reveals that atmospheric temperature and CO2 levels move in close proximity and that temperature movements precede CO2 increases.</p>
<p>&quot;There are thousands of scientists worldwide who challenge the blind adherence to the Kyoto model pointing out that world temperatures have fluctuated dramatically through the ages. The Malankovich Cycles explain the orbital and tilt variations of the earth and the corresponding changes in exposure to solar radiation particular in polar regions.</p>
<p>&quot;We know that the oceans of the world play a critical part in the carbon cycle. Atmospheric carbon dioxide readily dissolves in seawater. The soluble carbon dioxide concentration in the oceans is 50 times greater than in the atmosphere. Insoluble carbonates in oceans account for 50,000 times the quantity of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>&quot;The absorption and release of carbon dioxide from the oceans is temperature dependent. It is estimated that 800 billion tons of carbon is recycled naturally each year in this way. Since 1850, 24 billion tons of CO2 has been generated annually from human activity, over half being absorbed by the oceans.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Hodgson should also understand that atmospheric carbon dioxide, along with other greenhouse gases, water vapour and methane absorb outgoing radiation only in specific wavebands. Scientists have reported that these particular wavebands that absorb CO2 are already at saturation point. Therefore no more infrared radiation can be absorbed even if we double or treble atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.</p>
<p>&quot;Like most scientific endeavours the more we learn about climate change the less we know. That is of course unless you are Mr Hodgson who is becoming renowned for his single-minded arrogance on the subject.</p>
<p>&quot;Regrettably climate change and global warming have become highly politicised with dogma and mantras being used to drive set agendas. This is the antithesis of good science and I welcome the contrary views put by Mr Illarionov,&quot; Mr Shirley said.</p>
