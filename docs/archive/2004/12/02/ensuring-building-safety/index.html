<p>ENSURING BUILDING SAFETY</p>
<p>Buildings are being erected in every spare section of land in Auckland City at a rapid rate but do the new building materials meet old regulations? A PhD engineering student at The University of Auckland is setting out to ensure that buildings are constructed safely.</p>
<p>Civil Engineering student Nick Brooke has been looking at whether the current building rules are still relevant when using new reinforcing steel in concrete-frame buildings.</p>
<p>Funded by the Earthquake Commission Research Foundation, the aim of the research is to ensure construction standards are maintained.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a set of requirements and performance levels that must be achieved to make sure these buildings are up to standard,&quot; says Nick.</p>
<p>&quot;These rules have been around for sometime so I carried out tests to see whether the existing rules still worked when using the new materials.&quot;</p>
<p>Testing involved constructing a small section of a reinforced concrete frame building.</p>
<p>Nick then simulated the loading of an earthquake on the section to see whether the performance of the structure was affected by the use of the new material.</p>
<p>His research is helping in a review of the building rules and the Greenlane resident says his findings show that the current design rules are reliable.</p>
<p>&quot;We don&#39;t need major adjustments. The rules appear to be slightly conservative, so the rules and regulations could possibly be loosened up a bit.</p>
<p>&quot;We can conclude that construction of buildings is safe using reinforced steel concrete frame under the current rules.&quot;</p>
<p>With this phase of Nick&#39;s PhD now complete, he hopes to look into new innovative and effective methods for constructing buildings using pre cast concrete.</p>
<p>Precast concrete is formed in moulds offsite which are then trucked onto the construction site.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll be looking into better ways of putting the precast concrete together onsite,&quot; says the 23 year old.</p>
<p>The local construction industry has shown a strong interest in Nick&#39;s research.</p>
<p>&quot;Concrete has been seen as too messy on site and taking to long to construct, which has seen a growing interest in steel over the years. My findings will hopefully help lift the use of concrete.</p>
<p>And while his research makes headlines in the construction industry, Nick is making a mark at</p>
<p>The University of Auckland winning the top prize in the Faculty of Engineering&#39;s Postgraduate Society Poster Competition.</p>
<p>The competition provided an opportunity for students to display their current research by communicating in a manor that people other than engineers would understand.</p>
<p>Nick says the competition was a good way of developing skills to explain the technical aspect of his study to non-specialist audiences.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a bit of a challenge to break it down into to simple terms but to win this prize is a huge honour. It&#39;s always nice to be recognised in front of your peers.&quot;</p>
<p>Nick says his interest in construction comes from a fascination with bridges.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve had an interest in bridges since I was young so when staff from the Faculty of Engineering came to my school for a careers day I knew it was the natural direction for me.&quot;</p>
<p>After already completing a four-year Bachelor of Engineering degree specialising in Civil Engineering, and two years to go on his PhD, Nick hopes to utilise his skills and knowledge to design bridges.</p>
