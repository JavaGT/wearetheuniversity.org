<p>Primary Teacher Strikes Inevitable –NZ First</p>
<p>Bitter industrial action by primary teachers is inevitable, New Zealand First education spokesperson Brian Donnelly has warned.</p>
<p>“The seeds of these hostilities were sown by the Minister of Education in his gross mishandling of the secondary teachers’ collective contract during the last pay round.</p>
<p>“With an early election in 2002, Trevor Mallard simply rolled over, yielding to demands for guaranteed non-contact time and an additional step in the salary scale for secondary teachers.</p>
<p>“The Minister would have to be very naive if he could not see these additional conditions were going to be inevitably demanded by NZEI.</p>
<p>“What has exacerbated the situation is that kindergarten teachers are now to be paid the same as primary teachers but have guaranteed non-contact time just like secondary teachers.</p>
<p>“It is little wonder that primary teachers are bitter and are now demanding the same as kindergarten and secondary teachers.</p>
<p>“The problem for the Government is that such provisions will cost hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>“The teachers, the taxpayers and the students are all going to be losers out of this debacle,” said Mr Donnelly.  </p>
