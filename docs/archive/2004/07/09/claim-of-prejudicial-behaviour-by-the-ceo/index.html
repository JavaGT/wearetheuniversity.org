<p>Claim of prejudicial behaviour by the Chief Electoral Officer</p>
<p>I make this claim on behalf of registered Mäori voters in the electorate of Te Taihauäuru that we are likely to be prejudicially affected by certain decisions of the Chief Electoral Officer in regard to the polling booth arrangements for the by-election this Saturday, 10 July 2004.</p>
<p>The following attachments comprise the communications between myself and the Crown on this matter:<br>- Attachment 1 is a letter of 5 July 2004 from myself to the Electoral Commission setting out my concerns.<br>- The Commission referred my letter to the Chief Electoral Officer who replied late in the day. His letter, which provides an explanation of the choice of the polling booth arrangements for Te Taihauäuru for this Saturday, is attachment 2.<br>- Early today, 6 July 2004 certain analyses by one of our consultants was forwarded to the Chief Electoral Officer in response to his letter. This is attachment 3.<br>- Finally, a further letter of today’s date from the Chief Electoral Officer declining to offer any relief is attached. This is attachment 4.</p>
<p>We can observe from Attachment 1 that<br>- 311 of the 406 polling booths in 2002 will not be available on Saturday 10 July;<br>- a total of 6,074 Mäori voters, or 52 percent of the 11,752 Mäori who voted in Te Taihauäuru, used the 311 booths that will not be available in 2004; they will need to find another booth<br>- 47 towns and locations that had booths in 2002 and where 593 Mäori voted will not have this service in 2004<br>- a consequence of the abandonment of these 47 booths is that voters who would have been serviced by them will need transport to cover the extra distance that will now separate those voters who are involved from the polling booth.<br>When the formulae that are described in Attachment 2 are applied by our analysts we find the inconsistencies that are presented in Attachment 3. It is difficult to understand how the Chief Electoral Officer can ignore this as he has done in Attachment 4. This is in breach of Article 1 that provides for respectable kawanatanga and not one accepting of inconsistency.</p>

<p>The substantially reduced services to Mäori voters in Te Taihauäuru, from 406 booths in 2002 to 100 booths in 2004, is in stark contrast to the maintenance of services, relative to earlier years, of booth services in 1998 by-election in the Taranaki-King Country electorate which like Te Taihauäuru is also a large electorate. This is in breach of Article 3 of the Treaty. The maintenance of booth services for one partner to the Treaty; but not so for Mäori.</p>
<p>There are extra impediments to voting for the Taihauäuru voters whereas this was not imposed in the Taranaki-King Country by-election. This, too, is in breach of Article 3 of the Treaty.</p>
<p>The relief sought is to provide the same range of booth service for Te Taihauäuru that was the case in 2002.</p>
<p>Apart from the avoidance of the breach of Article 3, this relief would accommodate the pressure on booths that will result from the 300 canvassers that are expected to come from the other six Mäori electorates to raise Mäori participation in the democratic process.<br>URGENCY<br>An urgent hearing before the Waitangi Tribunal is requested because this would provide for the opportunity for the Crown to provide relief. Should the hearing not be heard before Saturday 9 July, the time for relief to be made available would have passed.</p>
