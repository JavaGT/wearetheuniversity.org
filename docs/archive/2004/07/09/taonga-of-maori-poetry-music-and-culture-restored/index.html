<p>Taonga of Maori Poetry, Music and Culture Restored</p>
<p>A taonga of Maori poetry music and culture was restored to the community at the Waipapa Marae, University of Auckland, on Wednesday night, 7 July 2004.</p>
<p>Nga Moteatea: The Songs – Part One, originally collected and translated by Apirana Ngata and Pei Te Hurinui Jones, was launched at the marae in the presence of representatives of the Ngata and Jones families.</p>
<p>The launch was the first step in producing a new edition of this national treasure, the largest and most comprehensive collection of Maori waiata and a unique contribution to New Zealand poetry, enhanced for the first time by audio CDs of its waiata.</p>
<p>An exciting and generous collaboration between scholars, the Polynesian Society, The University of, Creative New Zealand, the Lilburn Trust and experts from the music studios Atoll Ltd has made this project possible.</p>
<p>Nga Moteatea is a rich resource for continuing research and scholarship in many fields, offers prime texts in the teaching of Maori language, literature and tribal history and serves as inspiration for contemporary composition and performance.</p>
<p>Over a period of 40 year Sir Apirana Ngata, distinguished leader and scholar, collected and recorded hundreds of songs and chants from the iwi of Aotearoa, which became the four volumes of Nga Moteatea, with translations and annotations by Ngata and Pei te Hurinui Jones.</p>
<p>Auckland University Press is delighted to publish this completely redesigned and reset edition, commissioned by the Polynesian Society with substantial support from Creative New Zealand. The series will be published at the rate of one volume per year from 2004 until 2007.</p>

<p>It has been edited, on behalf of the Polynesian Society, by Jenifer Curnow and Dr Jane McRae, with the advice of Commissioning Editor Professor Margaret Mutu (HOD Maori Studies, University of Auckland).</p>
<p>The editors have been at pains to preserve the integrity of Ngata’s and Jones’s text and their commentary. Long vowels in Maori have been macronised and changes have been made to conform to current usage with correction of errors in grammar, spelling and punctuation. Typography has been modernised.</p>
<p>The CDs of the waiata were drawn from the Archive of Maori and Pacific Music at the University of Auckland. Production of the CDs was undertaken by Atoll Ltd and has been supported by the Lilburn Trust.</p>
