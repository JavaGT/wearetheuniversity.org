<p>Press Release</p>
<p>Auckland University of Technology forms joint venture with magazine founders</p>
<p>Former Unlimited and PCWorld publishers to create AUTPress</p>
<p>Two of New Zealand’s most successful magazine publishers are to join forces with Auckland University of Technology to create AUTPress, a new multi-media publishing company.</p>
<p>Vincent Heeringa, founding editor and publisher of business magazine Unlimited and Martin Bell, publisher of PCWorld and &gt;&gt;FFWD magazines this week signed an agreement with AUT to create a joint venture specialising in academic, educational and technical publishing.</p>
<p>Vice-chancellor Derek McCormack says the University is delighted to join forces with such innovative and dynamic partners to start up its publishing arm. “We’re getting two of the best in the business,” he said. Bell and Heeringa are excited at the potential growth in education and publishing.</p>
<p>“Both sectors are counted among some of the fastest growing in developed economies. We see huge opportunities for applying media disciplines to simple things such as improving the look and readability of student materials. We also see opportunities in translating complex research into effective communication,” Heeringa says.</p>
<p>As with other academic presses, AUTPress will not restrict its activities to publishing work from AUT scholars and staff.</p>
<p>“AUTPress’ brief will be to inform, educate and inspire. It will be sourcing great content from AUT, other universities and talented researchers anywhere in the world,” says McCormack.</p>

<p>AUTPress’ first activities will mostly be internal, focusing on improving the readability and design of AUT publications. But future products will include magazines, books, and papers and will also take advantage of the digital revolution with CD-Roms, websites, and DVD.</p>
<p>“The medium is less important. What matters is effective communication of complex material,” says Bell.</p>
<p>About Us Auckland University of Technology is New Zealand’s youngest and fourth-largest university, with a unique profile reflecting contemporary approaches to teaching, learning and research in higher education. Already highly regarded for its work in communications, design and business, the University has a clear focus on the practical and professional applications of technology and knowledge. “This joint venture is an example of AUT’s philosophy working in action,” says McCormack</p>
