<p>Pro-Vice Chancellor and Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences, Professor Deborah Willis, welcomed Dr Neale to her new role.</p>

<p>Dr Neale has worked at Victoria University since 1987, transferring from the private sector where she worked as a research consultant. Since 1992, she has held the position of Programme Director of the MA (Applied) in Social Science Research and has also worked as the Deputy Dean of the Humanities and Social Sciences Faculty since July 2001.</p>
<p>Dr Neale, a former school teacher and graduate of both Massey and Victoria Universities completed her PhD in 1997 from Deakin University in Australia.

Her latest research on the relationships between sisters has been widely acknowledged since publication in April 2004.</p>
