<p>University of Auckland appoints first Professor of Nursing</p>
<p>The University of Auckland&#39;s Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences has appointed its first Professor of Nursing to lead nursing research in New Zealand. This is a joint appointment with the Ministry of Health and establishes an important link between the country&#39;s leading school of nursing and the development of health policy in the Ministry.</p>
<p>Dr Frances Hughes has been appointed to the position after an extensive local and international search. She will continue her role as Chief Nursing Advisor at the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>As Professor of Nursing, Dr Hughes will undertake research in nursing, foster development of research within the School and collaboratively with external partners as well as provide academic leadership in nursing.</p>
<p>The Health Minister, Annette King says: &quot;It&#39;s an appropriate appointment. With her practical and policy background in nursing, Frances is one of the most knowledgeable people in the country on nursing issues and one of the most innovative thinkers.&quot;</p>
<p>Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences Dean Professor Peter Smith says the University is delighted to attract someone of Dr Hughes&#39; calibre.</p>
<p>&quot;She is a true ambassador of New Zealand nursing and her professionalism and expertise in policy development, research and practice are of the highest level,&quot; says Professor Smith.</p>
<p>Head of the University&#39;s School of Nursing Associate Professor Judy Kilpatrick says the position of Professor of Nursing is an important one with the responsibility for establishing a strong platform in nursing research - an area of health sciences research that is still in a development phase in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Hughes&#39; national and international experience as well as first hand knowledge of the New Zealand health sector will add to the development of our programmes and research profile,&quot; says Associate Professor Kilpatrick.</p>
