<p>Students ready for fight against fee increases</p>
<p>The fight to stop fee increases at public institutions came a step closer as students at the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) conference in Auckland last weekend met to plan the campaign for fee reductions in 2005.</p>
<p>“We know that many of our public tertiary institutions have huge surpluses. They should be looking to reduce student fees and students reliance on the harsh student loan scheme,” said Fleur Fitzsimons, NZUSA Co-President and Conference Spokesperson.</p>
<p>“We saw widespread protest action against fee increases last year, tertiary institution Councils and the government can expect to feel the heat from angry students again this year if fees go up,” said Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>Students also be discussed a campaign strategy to achieve a living allowance for all students and the Grandparenting of international student fees.</p>
<p>“While the government slightly increased access to allowances in the budget, many students are still forced to borrow to live,” said Kate Sutton, NZUSA Conference Spokesperson and President of the Auckland University Students’ Association. “We will not give up the fight for living allowances until all students are entitled to a living allowance to cover their basic costs of living.”</p>
<p>“The conference also discussed how to maximise the support of political parties and the public who share our concerns about the disastrous effects of massive student debt on our society and economy.”  </p>
