<p>Where&#39;s the Attorney-General On Judicial Activism?</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Justice Spokesman Stephen Franks today drew attention to Supreme Court Judge Thomas Gault&#39;s comments to a British Parliamentary committee about MPs&#39; criticism of &quot;judicial activism&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe Justice Gault&#39;s unhappiness over an MP&#39;s criticism of a particular case was a reference to my questioning of the Chief Justice&#39;s involvement in the seabed and foreshore case. He told the British MPs how pleased he was when newspaper editorials rounded on their Parliamentary critic,&quot; Mr Franks said.</p>
<p>&quot;How much more bitter the judges must have felt when they learned about Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen&#39;s attack on judicial activism, the day before the committee session in London. He raised some valid and important arguments. This is not to ignore the deep hypocrisy in Dr Cullen&#39;s speech, given his votes in favour of a string of acts infested with undefined terms like `principles of the Treaty&#39;, `accountability&#39; and `spiritual values&#39; which demand an active intervention of law by judges.</p>
<p>&quot;The pity is that it has been largely left to Parliamentarians, risking the destruction of valuable conventions against MPs&#39; criticism of judges, to blow the whistle on bad law. It should have been the Law Society, academics and practising lawyers - but first of all - the Attorney-General.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead, we have an Attorney-General who has been promoting law that forces judges to be activists, then not defending them from her own Cabinet colleagues - even after she castigated me for less sweeping questioning.</p>
<p>&quot;In Britain, judges have openly debated these matters. I wonder whether it is political correctness that has so longed delayed the same debate here. I&#39;d love to know what Justice Gault thinks of Dr Cullen&#39;s speech, given the Deputy Prime Minister&#39;s vote against my amendment to the Supreme Court Bill designed to rule out judicial activism,&quot; Mr Franks said.  </p>
