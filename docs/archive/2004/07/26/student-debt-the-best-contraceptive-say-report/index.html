<p>Student debt the best contraceptive says new report</p>
<p>Student debt is putting borrowers off having babies and shutting them out of home ownership, according to a report released today by the New Zealand Institute.</p>
<p>“The study: The Wealth of a Nation, contains many stories from New Zealanders about the negative effects debt has on their life decisions that policy makers should listen to,” said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>“Student debt is acting as a contraceptive at the very time when young people are looking to settle down and start families,” said Fitzsimons “Student loans are a social experiment that has gone dangerously wrong in New Zealand and the negative effects could haunt us for many years to come”</p>
<p>“The report backs up research conducted by NZUSA on nurses and teachers, which shows that student debt is a barrier to borrowers forming families. Demographers also back up these concerns about the long term effects of the student debt monster.”</p>
<p>“The evidence is clear: student debt is wreaking havoc with the lives of New Zealanders and threatening the ability of the country to meet workforce demands.”</p>
<p>“The government needs to act quickly by introducing a living allowance for all students and abolishing student tuition fees so that no New Zealander is forced to borrow from the harsh student loan scheme,” said Fitzsimons.</p>
