<p>Local Politicians Serve Students!</p>
<p>Mayor Sukhi Turner and candidates running in the mayoral elections will be serving students free steak and/or vegetarian patty sandwiches at the Otago University Students’ Association Clubs &amp; Societies Centre from 12noon till 2pm on Wednesday 21st July to promote healthy living on campus as part of the Annual Healthy Lifestyles Week.</p>
<p>Healthy Lifestyles Week is run annually by OUSA and also involves Otago Polytechnic and Dunedin College of Education students and is being run from Monday 19th July – Sunday 25th July. Over 50 different activities are run through the week to promote healthy living. The activities include gym sessions, dance classes, introduction to different outdoor sports such as rowing, scuba and canoeing. An opening ceremony is also held at the beginning of the week, where different health organizations set up stalls to pass on useful information to the student body. Event organiser Arsel Aslam said, “It gives us a chance of showing students how to have fun whilst maintaining a healthy environment.”  </p>
