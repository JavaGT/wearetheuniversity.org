<p>Media Release<br>30 July 2004</p>
<p>Congratulations Auckland University</p>
<p>New Zealand First says that amalgamation of the Auckland College of Education with Auckland University can only further enhance the reputation of the university as an international teaching and research institution.</p>
<p>“Northland will gain immense benefits, with both students and teachers enjoying the advantages of expanded academic and developing strategies to help the classroom learner,” said associate education spokesperson and Northland-based list MP Jim Peters.</p>
<p>“Auckland University is already a major player on the world tertiary education scene, and the merger with the College of Education will add value in terms of education, research and reputation.</p>
<p>“It is heartening to see the university go from strength to strength with initiatives such as this, and a lot of the credit must go to the departing Vice-Chancellor, John Hood, who leaves shortly to take up his appointment as Vice Chancellor of Oxford University.</p>
<p>“He leaves Auckland University in a position of strength, and it is to be hoped that the standards of excellence in all areas can be maintained and built upon. We are fortunate that Dr Hood will be able to maintain an interest in developing the knowledge and intellectual basis of New Zealand’s economic future.</p>
<p>“I congratulate Mr Hood and the university for their fine achievements,” said Mr Peters.</p>
