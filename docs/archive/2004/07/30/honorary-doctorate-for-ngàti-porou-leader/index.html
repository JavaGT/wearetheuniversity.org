<p>Honorary Doctorate for Ngàti Porou leader</p>
<p>Ngàti Porou leader Apirana Mahuika is to receive an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Waikato, as part of the university&#39;s 40th Anniversary celebrations. The Doctorate will be conferred at 10.30am on Saturday 31 July at the WEL Energy Trust Academy of Performing Arts at the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>The Honorary Doctorate recognises Apirana Mahuika&#39;s contribution to positive race relations in Aotearoa, knowledge of tikanga and his leadership of Ngàti Porou and Màoridom in general.</p>
<p>Apirana has been instrumental in developing links between the East Coast region and tertiary education, particularly with the University of Waikato. In 1987 he became a Research Fellow at the Centre for Màori Studies and Research with the late Sir Robert Mahuta. He holds a Masters of Arts degree from the University of Sydney and has also taught at Victoria and Massey Universities.</p>
<p>He was a founding member and now Chairperson of Te Ròpþ Manukura, which represents the 16 Iwi working with Waikato University to promote higher education throughout the central North Island.</p>
<p>Apirana has been Chairperson of Te Rþnanga o Ngàti Porou since its founding in 1987. He also chairs the Wànanga o Ngàti Porou which has recently joined the University of Waikato in a formal arrangement for adult education in the Ngàti Porou region.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Police recognised his work in race relations and in prisons by naming a training wing at the Porirua Police College after him.</p>
<p>Apirana&#39;s oratory skills in both Màori and English are widely acknowledged. These were tempered by his preparation as an Anglican priest, a role he combines more ecumenically today with his widespread duties as an Iwi leader.</p>
