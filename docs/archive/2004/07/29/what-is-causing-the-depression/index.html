<p>What Is Causing The Depression?</p>
<p>New Zealand First social services spokesperson Bill Gudgeon is urging the Government to find out why the country is full of stressed out and depressed people.</p>
<p>This follows the release of new figures showing a 101 percent increase in stress and depression over the last eight years.</p>
<p>“Stress and depression have been identified as the leading reasons behind the increase in the number of people claiming sickness or invalid benefits,” said Mr Gudgeon.</p>
<p>“Severe back pain was once the prime contributor to numbers on the sickness and invalid’s benefit. Now we’re facing a higher incidence of mental health issues preventing people from joining the workforce.</p>
<p>“The Minister, Steve Maharey, may claim that the growth in the number of people on disability-related benefits was a trend experienced by most OECD nations, but he should be asking himself why so many Kiwis are depressed and stressed out.</p>
<p>“It could well be that the Government only has themselves to blame. Unaffordable housing, rising student debt, rising costs, increased power prices and a worsening law and order situation are enough to make anyone depressed,” Mr Gudgeon concluded.</p>
