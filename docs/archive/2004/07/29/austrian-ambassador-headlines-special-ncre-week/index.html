<p>Austrian Ambassador Headlines Special NCRE Week, Aug. 2 - 6</p>
<p>The National Centre for Research on Europe (NCRE) will host Ambassador Martin Sajdik, Director General for European Integration and Economic Affairs in the Austrian Foreign Ministry, from July 31st to August 6.</p>
<p>The Centre&#39;s distinguished guest visit is part of a special week of events to highlight NCRE activities.</p>
<p>Ambassador Sajdik will present a series of five lectures at the Centre from Monday, August 2, until Friday, August 6.</p>
<p>These lectures are scheduled from 11.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. each day and will cover a range of EU-related issues, including:</p>
<p>* Can &quot;neutral&quot; European countries maintain their status and identity in a common EU foreign and security policy? * Can a Europe of 25 or more members be financed in the future with no more money? * Why are there so many critical voices on the prospect of Turkey becoming an EU member? Is Turkey a European country? * Is EU membership the ultimate healing force for all the pains undergone by the Western Balkan countries? * Why Russia won&#39;t become an EU member in the foreseeable future. * How likely is it that the Ukraine will join the EU? * Will the EU Neighbourhood Policy work? Can countries like Morocco and the Ukraine be treated in the same way?</p>
<p>NCRE will also host an Open Day on Wednesday, August 4.</p>
<p>As part of this Open Day, there will be a reception held in the Centre directly after Ambassador Sajdik&#39;s lecture and until 1.30 p.m.</p>
<p>Coinciding with these events is an NCRE display in the University of Canterbury Central Library from August 2 until August 20. This display will cover aspects of EU enlargement as well as information on NCRE&#39;s courses, scholarships and internships.</p>
<p>All events and lectures are open to the public.</p>
