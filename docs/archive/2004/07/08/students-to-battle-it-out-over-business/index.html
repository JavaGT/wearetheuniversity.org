<p>STUDENTS TO BATTLE IT OUT OVER BUSINESS</p>
<p>Some of the best budding business brains in the country go head-to-head this Saturday 10 July as the Waikato Management School hosts the second annual New Zealand Business Case Competition at Waikato University in Hamilton.</p>
<p>Teams of four students from Waikato Management School and Auckland, AUT, Massey, Otago and Victoria universities will all be given a &#39;mystery&#39; business case to deal with on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Each team has only six hours to read and analyse the case, and then prepare a presentation for judging by an expert panel of businesspeople and academics. Presentations start at 4pm in building PWC at the Waikato Management School.</p>
<p>&quot;The competition gives students hands on experience at dealing with real life business issues,&quot; says Waikato Management School lecturer Stephen Bowden. &quot;Waikato is working in partnership with Otago University to develop this competition, given the value it adds to students who will help make up the next generation of New Zealand&#39;s business leaders. The contest is based in large part on our school&#39;s own internal case competition.&quot;</p>
<p>The Waikato team consists of Jessica Cameron, Katie Olsen, Jeremy Pak and Jonathon Peart. They&#39;ve been training hard, with numerous practice sessions under competition conditions.</p>
<p>Sponsors include Telecom, Meridian Energy and Gallagher Group. The winning team gets $2000 and mobile phones.</p>
<p>The judges include:</p>
<p>* Kelly Moore, general manager consumer and small business services, Telecom New Zealand</p>
<p>* Alan Seay, principal, communications and external relations, Meridian Energy</p>
<p>* Daniel Oh, regional business analyst for Accor NZ &amp; Fiji</p>
<p>* Dr Paul Knott, department of management, University of Canterbury</p>
<p>* Professor Armand Gilinsky, Sonoma State University, USA</p>
