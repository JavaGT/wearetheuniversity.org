<p>Dr Paul Hutchison</p>
<p>National Science Spokesman</p>

<p>Science shake-up a huge blow</p>
<p>National&#39;s Science spokesman, Paul Hutchison, says the decision to permanently down-size our most successful scientific facility is a huge blow for science in New Zealand.</p>
<p>He is commenting on an announcement yesterday that staff numbers at the AgResearch Centre at Wallaceville in Upper Hutt are to be reduced from over 130 to just 11.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of the scientists affected have been offered positions at other centres but early indications are that a lot won&#39;t accept them. In fact, many are planning to take their talent overseas,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;These changes don&#39;t just affect AgResearch but science and research at ESR and Massey, Otago and Waikato Universities.</p>
<p>&quot;Wallaceville is recognised internationally as a top research and science centre, the scientists that have lost their jobs won&#39;t be unemployed for long - job offers will be coming in thick and fast from around the world.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a strong case to build on the strengths of Wallaceville at Wallaceville. The Government must now commit to funding a national biosecurity centre at Wallaceville.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government must show the scientific community that its work is valued and give our scientists a reason to stay,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
