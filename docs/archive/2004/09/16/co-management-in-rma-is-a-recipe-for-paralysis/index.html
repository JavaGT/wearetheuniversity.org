<p>John Key MP National Party Finance Spokesman</p>
<p>16 September 2004</p>
<p>Co-management in RMA is a recipe for paralysis</p>
<p>National Party Finance spokesman John Key says the Government&#39;s plan to insert a specific Maori co-management clause as part of its tinkering with the RMA is a &quot;recipe for further paralysis&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has made plenty of noise about how the changes to the RMA give Maori no more say in important decisions than they do everyone else.</p>
<p>&quot;But there&#39;s more sizzle than sausage in those statements,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is actually saying one thing and doing quite the opposite with its co-management clause.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister is dancing on the head of a pin with his answers to questions in Parliament today.</p>
<p>&quot;Most New Zealanders will find it hard to understand how a direct reference to iwi co-management in the Bill does not mean special rights and privileges are being conferred on Maori.</p>
<p>&quot;If Maori aren&#39;t getting extra rights as a result of the Government&#39;s proposed amendments what did David Benson-Pope mean when he said &#39;councils will involve iwi in developing policy&#39;? &quot;The Government has also promised to provide councils with a list of Maori tangata whenua which they will be expected to deal with. However, the Minister admits he has &#39;absolutely no idea&#39; whether Te Puni Kokiri has written the list or when councils will get it.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Party, councils and undoubtedly Maori, will be interested to see that list because I think it will inevitably be controversial and likely to kick-start a fierce new debate among Maori and local authorities,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
