<p>Hon Bill English</p>
<p>National Education Spokesman</p>
<p>24 September 2004</p>
<p>Mallard&#39;s funding priorities in disarray</p>
<p>&quot;Under Labour, bureaucratic growth at the Ministry of Education leaves the growth in schools&#39; funding for dead, and parents have been left to meet the shortfall,&quot; says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;Since 1999, the per-pupil funding increase in spending on schools&#39; operations has been 10%. But, by contrast, the Ministry&#39;s operating budget has increased by 44%, the NZQA&#39;s has almost tripled, and ERO&#39;s has increased by 26%.</p>
<p>&quot;When parents are selling raffle tickets to employ teachers and to buy software and books, they have every right to challenge spending on questionable items such as:</p>
<p>o Administration of regulation - $87.3m o Policy advice - $47.1m (doesn&#39;t include ownership advice - further $20.2m) o Curriculum support - $86m o Professional development - $114m (excluding school support $17.2m) o Developing strategic coherence - $19.4m o Capacity development - $16.4m</p>
<p>&quot;And if you want to know more about it, the education budget coughs up a further $54.4 million for &#39;information provision&#39;,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;The funding system gets messier by the month. At last count there were 36 pools that schools could apply to for extra funding, tied up with 32 new education strategies.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s ironic that at a time when we have the biggest surplus in a lifetime, the state education sector is dependent on half a billion dollars raised by parents and communities.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time money was redirected away from bureaucrats and PC initiatives and towards teachers and students,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
