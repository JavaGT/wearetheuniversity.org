<p>NZEI Members Applaud Primary Teachers Settlement</p>
<p>The country&#39;s largest education union, NZEI Te Riu Roa, started its Annual Meeting in Wellington today, buoyed by the news that its negotiating team has reached settlement on a proposed collective employment agreement for its 25,000 primary teacher members worth $420 million.</p>
<p>The union has a total of 43,000 members working as teachers and principals in primary schools, teachers in early childhood education services, support staff in primary and secondary schools, special education staff in early childhood, primary and secondary schools and school advisers based at Colleges and Schools of Education.</p>
<p>The 400 members at the union&#39;s Annual Meeting applauded when in his opening speech their National President, Colin Tarr, described the proposed collective agreement as &quot;an historic step forward&quot; because for the first time primary teachers are being offered classroom release time to help address their excessive workload.</p>
<p>The four day Annual Meeting is being held in the Wellington Town Hall Auditorium and runs until Wednesday, September 22.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, Helen Clark will speak at 4pm tomorrow, Monday September 20. The Minister of Education, Trevor Mallard, is speaking at 11.40am on Wednesday September 22.</p>
