<p>Nadine Metzger said of Salient, “All three issues showed outstanding consistency in quality of subject matter, columns, design and editorial.”</p>
<p>Russell Brown said, “Salient has a particular strength in its news section, which is crisp, relevant and sets the tone for the rest of the magazine. Its reporters have shown themselves able to not only to break stories but to develop them over time.”</p>
<p>Selwyn Manning said, “Salient is a commanding publication that is clearly in touch with the Wellington student scene.”</p>
<p>Ant Hiron said, “I&#39;ve always thought Salient was the leader of the pack in terms of student mags and these three prove it for me.”</p>

<p>1. Magneto 2. = Critic, Craccum, Debate, and Salient</p>

<p>Finlay MacDonald said, “I chose winners who avoided the ritual slagging of ‘mainstream media’ and got on with expressing themselves in a nicely personalised, chatty and idiosyncratic style.”</p>

<p>1. Tim Molloy, Craccum 2. Colin Andrews, Critic 3. Scott Bevan and Kent Earle, Debate</p>
<p>Ant Sang called Tim Molloy’s cartoon Mr Unpronounceable “odd, trippy, beautifully drawn”.</p>

<p>Jenny Nichols said of Nexus, “This sophisticated, unconventional designer seems to enjoy the collision of meaning with visual and aesthetic impact, the essence of graphic design.”</p>
<p>Steve Braunias said of Critic, “Here is a magazine which shows an admirable sense of stupidity. It knows that a student magazine needn&#39;t appeal to taste or some dreary idea of current affairs; that working for it should be fun, a chance to do whatever the fuck it wants.”</p>

<p>David Cohen said, “Ryan Brown-Haysom&#39;s portfolio of ‘Media Vuelta!’ columns from Critic made me laugh out loud: his post-Qantas Media Awards piece, in particular, … has a refreshingly light touch and buckets of cool attitude.”</p>
