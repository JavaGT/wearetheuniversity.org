<p>Thai fair trade campaigners to brief media</p>
<p>Green Party Co-leader Rod Donald is inviting media to a briefing by two Thai campaigners on the so-called &#39;free trade&#39; agreement currently being negotiated between the governments of Thailand and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Mr Donald is hosting the duo, law professor Dr Jakkrit Kuanpoth and former sweatshop worker Sripai Nonsee. The campaigners are speaking at public meetings around New Zealand, including one in Wellington on Wednesday (7:30pm - St John&#39;s Hall, cnr Willis and Dixon Streets), about how a free trade agreement between Thailand and New Zealand would hurt jobs, wages and working conditions and damage the environment.</p>
<p>Dr Jakkrit Kuanpoth is a Law Professor in Thailand and is currently a Visiting Senior Fellow at the University of Wollongong, Australia.</p>
<p>Ms Sripai Nonsee worked for nine years in a Bangkok sweatshop before being sacked for trying to unionise workers. She now works with NGOs helping factory workers organise.</p>
<p>Media briefing Time: 1pm Tuesday 14th September. Place: 14th Floor, Bowen House, Parliament.</p>
<p>Media and the public are also invited to a seminar on the proposed New Zealand - Thailand FTA at 12.30pm on Wednesday 15th September at the Beehive Theatrette. Speakers include Dr Kuanpoth, Ms Nonsee, Rod Donald and CTU President, Ross Wilson.</p>
