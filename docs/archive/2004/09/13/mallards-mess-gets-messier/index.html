<p>Hon Bill English<br>National Education Spokesman</p>
<p>13 September 2004</p>
<p>Mallard&#39;s mess gets messier</p>
<p>The reinstatement of Alison Annan as principal of Cambridge High School is a slap in the face for the Minister of Education who has tried to blame all of the problems with the NCEA on one principal, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>The Employment Relations Authority today ordered the reinstatement of the beleaguered school&#39;s former principal.</p>
<p>The depth of problems with the NCEA were first revealed at Cambridge High School.</p>
<p>&quot;In an effort to avoid wider scrutiny of the system, the Minister has put all of his efforts into blaming the school instead of looking at the NCEA,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever happens with Mrs Annan and Cambridge High, the NCEA has a multitude of problems, and targeted bullying will not make that fact go away.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents, teachers and students will all be concerned that the Minister will do anything, including potentially breaching employment law, to try to prove his own political points.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard needs to own up to the problems with the NCEA and get on with fixing them,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
