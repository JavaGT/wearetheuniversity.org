<p>Five Years A Cruel Joke On Communities</p>
<p>Friday 3 Sep 2004</p>
<p>Deborah Coddington - Press Releases - Crime &amp; Justice</p>
<p>Sentencing paedophile Peter Liddell to preventive detention with a minimum of five years is a joke, ACT New Zealand Associate Justice Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Liddell has been labelled `one of New Zealand&#39;s most dangerous child sex abusers&#39;, yet he could be out again, committing crimes, before his latest victim celebrates his 21^st birthday,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;This highlights the myth of preventive detention. The public think this sentence is a lifetime jail term, but judges set the minimum period before parole can be considered.</p>
<p>&quot;Liddell has yet again shown how white, middle class, former professionals get treated favourably in the justice system. He conned his way into families&#39; trust as a counsellor at Middlemore Hospital, where at least one of his victims committed suicide as a result of Liddell&#39;s abuse.</p>
<p>&quot;Then he worked at Auckland&#39;s Kings College. He is the master of making himself look `respectable&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;When he was released on parole in 1998, half-way through his last sentence, I was slammed for condemning his release. The usual do-gooders told me Liddell had `paid his price to society&#39;, `been rehabilitated&#39; and I should leave him alone.</p>
<p>&quot;I predicted he would reoffend and he has. I was phoned in 2002 by a concerned mother in the Waiuku district who&#39;d spotted Liddell cruising around with young boys. I told her to go to the police.</p>
<p>&quot;Liddell is a menace. I&#39;ve heard stories about Liddell that make you weep. I hope the Crown will appeal this sentence and ensure Liddell is locked up for a long, long time,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
