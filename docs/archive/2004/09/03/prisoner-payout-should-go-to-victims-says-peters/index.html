<p><strong>Friday, 3 September 2004, 12:09 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Prisoner Payout Should Go To Victims Says Peters</p>
<p>New Zealand First says it is outrageous that the High Court has awarded $130,000 to five inmates at Paremoremo while their victims get nothing but grief and suffering.</p>
<p>“Victims of crimes committed by these inmates will be stunned to hear that the courts are prepared to pay criminals hundreds of thousands of dollars while victims get nothing but grief,” said Mr Peters.</p>
<p>“For too long the offenders in the country have had all the rights while the victims, whose lives are often ruined, have no comeback.</p>
<p>“The Government must appeal the case, but if the awards stand then the money should be ordered to go to the victims of these people.</p>
<p>Mr Peters said inmates should be covered by a similar law introduced some time ago to stop offenders receiving ACC payments for injuries sustained during the commission of a crime.</p>
<p>“It is also important for the Government to stop sitting on its hands over this issue. It should have acted after other inmates were paid compensation some years ago,” said Mr Peters.</p>
