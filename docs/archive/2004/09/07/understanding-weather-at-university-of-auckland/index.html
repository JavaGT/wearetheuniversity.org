<p>Understanding Weather at The University of Auckland</p>
<p>Why is the weather great one day and horrible the next? You can find answers to this question and more at a course organised by The University of Auckland’s Centre for Continuing Education.</p>
<p>Entitled Understanding Weather, the six-week course runs from September 14 until October 19 and participants will learn about the various aspects of weather, including sunshine hours, patterns of rainfall, and cloud formation.</p>
<p>Community Education Programme Manager Jo Davies says a course on weather is timely “considering the extreme weather events the country has faced this year.</p>
<p>“The course would be of interest to a range of people such as boaties, trampers and horticulturalists for whom weather is an important factor in either their work or recreational activities. It provides the opportunity to learn about the fascinating topic of weather in easily understood language,” says Jo.</p>
<p>The course tutor, David Stow, has 35 years of research and teaching experience in general physics, geophysics and applied meteorology.</p>
<p>He will share secrets that govern the formation of clouds, the myths and mysteries of rainmaking, understanding the weather map and satellite images, the influence of the sun and its radiation, and the creation of the great wind patterns and gentle breezes.</p>
<p>Understanding Weather costs $100 and interested people can find out more about the course or register by calling (09) 373 7599 ext. 87831 or ext. 87832.</p>
<p>Details:<br>Title: Understanding Weather<br>Time: Six sessions from Tuesday September 14 – October 19 (6-8pm)<br>Venue: Room 032, Clock Tower Building, 22 Princes Street<br>Cost: $100 (incl. GST)</p>
