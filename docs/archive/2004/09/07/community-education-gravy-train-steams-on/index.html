<p>Hon Bill English<br>National Education Spokesman</p>

<p>Community education gravy train steams on</p>
<p>&quot;The construction industry and supermarkets are the latest benefactors of the community education gravy train,&quot; says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>The construction industry is attracting tertiary education funding for four-hour building site induction courses.</p>
<p>Supermarkets also run induction courses funded out of the tertiary education dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;These courses should be paid for by the industries themselves, as they always have been, not by money designated for tertiary education,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>Workers or their employees are charged between $40 and $120 each to cover the course costs while Unitec and Site Safe pocket the government EFTS subsidy.</p>
<p>The construction industry previously ran a two-hour induction course in association with Unitec. This was extended to four hours, enabling Unitec to claim EFTS funding.</p>
<p>&quot;So they made the course compulsory and have the cheek to charge a $40 penalty to anyone not wanting to do the course or who fills the form out incorrectly.</p>
<p>&quot;Unitec contributes nothing to the running of these courses - no tutors, no materials and no qualification at the end of it. But they manage to walk away with hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;The scheme is attractive to industry because the free training allows them to fulfill their OSH obligations,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>Answers to written questions show that more than 50 000 people have enrolled in these courses.</p>
<p>&quot;TEC has loopholes big enough to drive a train through, Steve Maharey has got to clean the commission up and put a stop to this sort of scam,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
