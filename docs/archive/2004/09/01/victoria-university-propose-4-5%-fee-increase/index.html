<p>Victoria University Propose 4.5% Fee Increase</p>
<p>Victoria University students face a possible 4.5% hike in tuition fees for 2005, said Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) president Amanda Hill today. The University Council will meet to consider the proposal on Thursday 9 September at 4pm in the Hunter Council Chamber.</p>
<p>“Victoria increased fees last year by three percent, and the proposed 4.5 percent increase will be the last straw for many students” said Hill. “There is no justification for such a large increase on the back of three years of excessive surpluses – the University management are once again showing that profit drives Victoria rather than the welfare of students.”</p>
<p>“The Labour government has failed to fund the knowledge economy it so desperately wants. In the face of seven billion dollars of student debt, they continue to allow institutions to raise fees to compensate for inadequate Government funding” said Hill today.</p>
<p>“Victoria can get by without a fee increase, particularly if it discontinues pouring money into marketing – to use their phrase, it makes you think” Hill said.</p>
<p>Hill warned that students would commence rolling actions when class resumed on Monday, and would not stop until the proposal was withdrawn or University Council agreed to a zero increase in fees.</p>
