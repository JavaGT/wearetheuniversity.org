<p>Dr Paul Hutchison National Science Spokesman</p>
<p>1 September 2004</p>
<p>No employment guarantees for Wallaceville scientists</p>
<p>AgResearch has refused to give any employment guarantees to Wallaceville&#39;s world famous animal reproduction scientific team despite plans to split it up, says National&#39;s Science spokesman Dr Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>In the Science &amp; Education Select Committee today, AgResearch&#39;s CEO Dr Andy West said there were no employment guarantees for the scientists. AgResearch is proposing to move virtually all its scientific teams from Wallaceville to Massey and Otago.</p>
<p>Dr Hutchison says despite attempts to gag the scientists, many have spoken out, saying the relocation will force them to go overseas or leave science permanently.</p>
<p>&quot;The badly handled process has caused huge dismay to Dr Ken McNatty&#39;s reproductive team.</p>
<p>&quot;We can&#39;t afford to wave some of our best scientists offshore.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government says they want to focus on biotechnology as a driver of growth, but they are constantly making it harder for scientists to thrive.&quot;</p>
<p>A few months ago Pfizer withdrew $65 million of research funding and, only last week, Auckland medical researchers had to contract their Huntington&#39;s disease research to Australia because it would cost too much and take too long to get consents in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Dr Hutchison says it is vital for agriculture that the Government review AgResearch&#39;s proposals, ensuring that scientists get help, not hindrance, to do their work in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Hutt Valley Chamber of Commerce today called for an independent review of AgResearch&#39;s redevelopment plans.</p>
