<p>Nobel Laureate first Canterbury Distinguished Professor</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury has named Nobel Prize winner, Professor Clive Granger, as its first Canterbury Distinguished Professor.</p>
<p>Professor Granger, who retired last year from the University of California at San Diego, first visited UC’s Department of Economics as an Erskine Fellow in 2000 and has since made two private visits to the department.</p>
<p>In fact, he was in Christchurch when it was announced last year that he was joint recipient of the Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences.</p>
<p>Professor Granger is due to return to UC on September 27 and will stay until December. Professor Les Oxley, who heads the Department of Economics, says Professor Granger is one of the world’s leading econometricians.</p>
<p>“He is a wonderful visitor, keen and happy to share his incredibly insightful mind with student and faculty members, in economics, finance and mathematics and statistics departments alike.” Only exceptional visitors, such as Nobel laureates, will be considered for the Distinguished Professor position. The University expects only two or three visitors will be given the title over the next five to 10 years.  </p>
