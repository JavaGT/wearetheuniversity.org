<p>Lincoln University names new Assistant Vice-Chancellor</p>
<p>Lincoln University has filled a second senior management position within a month with the appointment of Dr Sheelagh Matear of Dunedin to the post of Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Academic).</p>
<p>This latest Lincoln University appointment follows that of Dr Chris Kirk from Massey University as Deputy Vice-Chancellor.</p>
<p>Dr Matear comes to Lincoln University after 10 years in the Department of Marketing at Otago University, first as a senior lecturer and since 2000 as an associate professor. In 2001 she was Head of the Department of Marketing, one of the University of Otago’s largest departments.</p>
<p>As Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Academic) Dr Matear becomes Lincoln University’s senior manager in charge of all the University’s regulations, procedures and protocols relating to courses and qualifications. In addition she will manage many student related areas. She takes up her post on 13 December.</p>
<p>Dr Matear sees the Lincoln University position as a “significant opportunity” to pursue a “long-standing interest in senior level university leadership”. She says that Lincoln University’s integrated and interdisciplinary approach to its teaching and research programmes holds particular appeal for her.</p>
<p>Experienced in academic programme development, quality assurance and policy development, Dr Matear has had responsibility at Otago University for doctoral and research masters degree issues in the School of Business and has been chair of the Marketing Department’s Postgraduate Committee.</p>

<p>Born in Bangor, Northern Ireland, Dr Matear holds a PhD in Transport Marketing from the University of Plymouth along with BSc(Hons) and MSc degrees.</p>
<p>She lectured at the University of Plymouth while completing her PhD then spent two-and-a-half years at the University of Arizona working in the Management Information Sciences and Economic Development areas.</p>
<p>As an academic she has a sustained track record in postgraduate supervision, journal publication, and attracting external research funding.</p>
<p>Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Roger Field welcomes the new addition to his senior management team. He says that Professor Matear (Subs note: her designation at Lincoln will be “Professor”) will bring a valuable set of skills to the University’s operation and, through her specialist academic background, an understanding of many of Lincoln University’s own niche area specialisations.</p>
