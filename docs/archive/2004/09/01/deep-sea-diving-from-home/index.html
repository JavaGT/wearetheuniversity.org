<p>Deep sea diving - from home</p>
<p>The call is out to New Zealand schools for pupils to take part in a virtual field trip to the ocean floor of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Extreme 2004: Expedition to the Deep Frontier will run from November 30 to December 20 this year.</p>
<p>Waikato University and University of Delaware marine biologist Craig Cary will lead a research team to explore the deep sea vents and the organisms that live in them, such as the Pompeii worm, one of the &quot;hottest&quot; animals on the planet.</p>
<p>For the last five years, American students have been able to take part in the National Science Foundation expedition and now it&#39;s time to involve New Zealand students, says Dr Cary.</p>
<p>&quot;My hope is to get 50 schools in New Zealand enrolled in the program - with New Zealand&#39;s interest in the ocean and dependency on geothermal features this program is a natural. We&#39;ll be working aboard the research vessel Atlantis and the submersible Alvin, which discovered the Titanic in 1986. The submersible will be making daily dives to a 2500m deep site about 1500km off the coast of Costa Rica. The team, which includes four researchers from Waikato University, will be exploring how life can survive the extreme temperatures - more than 100 C - experienced down there.&quot;</p>
<p>Students from around the world are being invited to be involved in the 21-day expedition - which will mean they can email the scientists during the voyage, design their own experiments and take part in a Virtual Science Fair.</p>
<p>Schools are being offered free classroom materials about the deep sea, including a documentary video, curricula and resource guides for each student.</p>

<p>&quot;There is also an interactive website which is updated daily during the expedition with journals, photos and video clips from the seafloor, and interviews with the crew.&quot;</p>
<p>Also, 50 classrooms will be selected to participate in live conference phone calls with the scientists as they conduct research in Alvin on the seafloor. Registrations are on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
