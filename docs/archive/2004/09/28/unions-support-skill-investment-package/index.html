<p>Unions Support Skill Investment Package</p>
<p>The funding increase for modern apprenticeships and industry training would help to tackle the critical skill shortage but needed to be on-going to ensure sustainable economic growth, Council of Trade Unions secretary Carol Beaumont said today.</p>
<p>The CTU supported the Government announcement today of funding for an additional one thousand modern apprenticeships and a lift of $5 million for industry training.</p>
<p>“There is widespread acknowledgement of chronic under-investment in the 1990s in industry training and this has resulted in employers today crying out for skilled labour,” Carol Beaumont said. “The CTU has been a consistent advocate of increased funding for modern apprenticeships and overall industry training.”</p>
<p>There would need to be ongoing increases in budget allocations for industry training if New Zealand was to meet the needs of a high-wage, high-skill economy, she said.</p>
<p>The CTU and Business NZ have joined forces with the Government in a tripartite organisation, skillnz, to promote participation in industry training.</p>
