<p><strong>Wednesday, 8 September 2004, 10:22 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Students to present MPs at Civil Union Bill hearing with Homer Simpson’s warning against ‘homerphobia’</p>
<p>Student representatives from the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) will today present their submission in favour of the Civil Union Bill and give MPs a poster asking them to consider who homophobia has prevented them from knowing.</p>
<p>“The Civil Union bill is a step forward for New Zealand in recognising the rights of same sex couples and signalling that homophobia will not be tolerated,” said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of NZUSA.</p>
<p>In a survey completed by NZUSA, 40 percent of queer students said that they had experienced harassment on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity whilst participating in tertiary study.</p>
<p>“The harassment experienced by queer students causes much suffering and undermines their ability to take part in education,” said Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>“We will be presenting MPs at the select committee with a poster of Homer Simpson asking them who homophobia has prevented them from knowing,” said Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>“MPs who voted against the Civil Union Bill are voting against basic human rights for same sex couples and for more homophobia and intolerance in our society.”</p>
<p>Students are speaking to the Select Committee at 9:45am at Parliament.</p>
