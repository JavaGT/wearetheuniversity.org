<p><strong>Thursday, 2 September 2004, 8:46 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Ministers hysterical in the face of criticism</p>
<p>“Increasingly hysterical claims by Trevor Mallard and Steve Maharey about my criticism of the NCEA shows the government is worried about the credibility of their policy.</p>
<p>“A number of statements made by the Ministers are just plain wrong,” he says.</p>
<p>“And we have seen Mallard at his bullying, shouting, dishonest worst.</p>
<p>The box I presented to the NZQA contained student assessment books on the basis of which credits were awarded. These credits had been signed off by teachers.</p>
<p>The assessments were signed off by long-term staff, not by a relief teacher.</p>
<p>No teacher involved is subject to competency procedures.</p>
<p>The school itself confirmed problems in the New Zealand Herald last Thursday morning, before I raised the issue in the House.</p>
<p>There was no discussion of the matter at National’s Caucus meeting.</p>
<p>Sandra Goudie has not threatened to resign as a result of my actions.</p>
<p>“I have not apologised to the school because there is no reason to do so. Mr Mallard was lying when he said this today in Parliament,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“Trevor Mallard and Steve Maharey are willing to say or do anything to shut down criticism of the NCEA but I will not be bullied like this and neither will parents and teachers.</p>
<p>“Mr Mallard should commit to a review of the NCEA to fix these problems which are widely acknowledged so that we can be assured of consistency and quality in the education system”.</p>
