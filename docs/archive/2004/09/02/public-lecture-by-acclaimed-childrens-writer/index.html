<p>2 September 2004</p>
<p>Public lecture by acclaimed children’s writer</p>
<p>Internationally-acclaimed children’s author and illustrator Gavin Bishop will deliver a free public lecture at 7pm on Wednesday 8 September at the University of Auckland’s Epsom campus (formerly the Auckland College of Education, now the Faculty of Education).</p>
<p>Gavin is the Sylvia Ashton-Warner Library Fellow for 2004 and is to deliver his lecture It’s not as easy as it looks Part 2, about the difficulties involved in writing and illustrating a deceptively simple book for young children.</p>
<p>Gavin is renowned as an author and illustrator who has won many awards since the early 1980s, most recently for Weaving earth and sky, written by Robert Sullivan and illustrated by Gavin, which won the NZ Post Children’s Book Awards in 2003.</p>
<p>The Sylvia Ashton-Warner Library has purchased seven limited edition reproductions of his illustrations from Weaving earth and sky, which will be unveiled on the same evening, to hang in the Library.</p>
<p>The Fellowship was instituted in 2002 by the former Auckland College of Education. Gavin Bishop follows Margaret Mahy who was the inaugural fellow.</p>
<p>“It’s not as easy as it looks, part 2” 7pm, 8 September, Duncan McGhie Theatre, Gate 3, Epsom Campus, The University of Auckland, 74 Epsom Ave.</p>
