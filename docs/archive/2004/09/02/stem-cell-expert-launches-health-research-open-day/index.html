<p>Stem Cell Expert Launches Health Research Open Day</p>
<p>This year’s Health Research Open Day at the Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Sciences, features a top international expert on stem cell research from Monash University, Melbourne.</p>
<p>The Health Research Open Day is on Sunday September 5, from 1pm-4pm, and is jointly organised by the Canterbury Medical Research Foundation and the School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Otago University.</p>
<p>Professor Alan Trounson is the director of Australia’s main research centre into using stem cells for treatment, the Monash Immunology and Stem Cell Laboratories, which were established with a $46 million dollar grant by the Government in 2002.</p>
<p>He will speak in the Rolleston Lecture Theatre at 1pm on “Stem Cells—Promises and Challenges for Society”. Professor Trounson’s main research interests at present are focused on human embryonic stem cells for therapeutic use, and their suitability for transplantation for the treatment of inflammatory lung disease and cystic fibrosis.</p>
<p>Professor Trounson will be just one of a number of speakers on the latest health research, ranging from bi-polar disorder to inflammatory bowel disease, and drug use.</p>
<p>The Open Day, with the theme of ‘Research Saves Lives’, provides an opportunity for the public to visit laboratories, meet researchers and to understand how research translates into improved health care. The foyer of the School will be filled with interactive displays on health research, while there will be continuous tours to laboratories and talks on research issues in the Rolleston Lecture Theatre. There will also be tours to Radiation Treatment at Christchurch Hospital, and the recently established Van der Veer Institute for Parkinson’s and Brain Research.</p>
