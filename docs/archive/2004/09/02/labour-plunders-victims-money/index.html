<p>National Law &amp; Order spokesman</p>

<p>Labour plunders victims&#39; money</p>
<p>The Government is plundering money meant for the victims of crime to pay for bureaucracy, says National&#39;s Law and Order spokesman, Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>He is commenting on Ministry of Justice Budget papers which show the Government is taking money from a special fund, which was set up to help victims, to pay for restructuring at Victim Support.</p>
<p>&quot;This fund contains $580,000 which Parliament ring-fenced to fund &#39;special victim assistance schemes&#39;, but this Labour Government is now plundering the fund to pay for restructuring.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not Victim Support&#39;s fault. It&#39;s about the Government having the wrong priorities and no respect for victims.</p>
<p>&quot;For a start, changes at Victim Support should have been funded separately. They deserve government support, but this shouldn&#39;t come from funds Parliament voted specifically for victims&#39; travel and counselling costs.</p>
<p>&quot;The Budget papers, obtained under the Official Information Act, also show the Government is further proposing to each year cut $100,000 from victims&#39; special assistance schemes, and $36,000 from the schemes&#39; administration fund to also help pay for the restructuring.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government is plundering hundreds of thousands of dollars from victims to pay for bureaucracy, and what&#39;s more it hasn&#39;t told anyone.</p>
<p>&quot;Parliament set this money aside to help victims attend court hearings, parole hearings and receive counselling.</p>
<p>&quot;Victims tell me it is very hard to get money out of these funds. Spending it on restructuring will make it a whole lot harder,&quot; Mr Ryall says.</p>
