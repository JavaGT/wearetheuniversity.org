<p>Minister tries creative accounting with child abuse numbers</p>
<p>National MP Katherine Rich says the Minister responsible for Child, Youth and Family Minister is trying some creative accounting on child abuse numbers.</p>
<p>“How can the Minister claim that child abuse and neglect cases have come down since 1999, when she knows thousands of calls to CYF go unanswered and thousands of cases remain unallocated?”</p>
<p>Answers to parliamentary questions show 3682 cases were unallocated as at 30 June 2004. Thousands of calls weren’t being answered, according to information advised earlier this year. Judge Mick Brown said cases that were left would escalate over time.</p>
<p>Mrs Rich says the Minister has a nerve making definitive statements about ‘substantiated’ cases and playing the Pollyanna glad game with child abuse in this country. Not a week goes by that there isn’t a child abuse story.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders will not be deceived by the Minister’s creative accounting. The Minister must stop playing games with children at risk.</p>
<p>“For the Minister to try to put a positive spin on it is irresponsible,” says Mrs Rich.</p>
