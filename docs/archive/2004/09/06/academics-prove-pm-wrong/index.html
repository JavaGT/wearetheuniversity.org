<p>Wayne Mapp MP National Party Associate Treaty Spokesman</p>
<p>06 September 2004</p>
<p>Academics prove PM wrong</p>
<p>National Party Associate Treaty spokesman Wayne Mapp is concerned by the reluctance of some academics to distance themselves from claims of &#39;civil war&#39; over the Foreshore and Seabed legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;Again at the select committee hearings today we have heard a range of views about the prospect of &#39;civil war&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Dame Joan Metge, Dr Manuka Henare and Dr David Williams were all questioned about their opinions on the remarks by Auckland University Professor Margaret Mutu who forecast &#39;the sorts of things ... that happen in Palestine and Israel&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Their views differed but two of the three appeared reluctant to disassociate themselves from Margaret Mutu&#39;s civil war claims.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t think any New Zealander, Maori or non-Maori can possibly believe this kind of extreme language is acceptable or helpful.</p>
<p>&quot;According to Helen Clark, these academics are supposed to &#39;look at the facts in a dispassionate way, to reason carefully. And all I can say about the statements of Margaret Mutu is they don&#39;t exhibit the characteristics of academia&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;But it would appear the &#39;academia&#39; is out to prove the Prime Minister wrong. Ms Clark must now send a clear signal about what she expects from those who are educating future leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders must also be concerned by suggestions of a back-down by John Tamihere.</p>
<p>&quot;He has claimed today that changes to the Foreshore and Seabed Bill are likely to take a &#39;huge level of heat&#39; out of the debate.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders deserve to be told up front what those changes are. We also deserve to be told what&#39;s being negotiated behind closed doors to ensure the &#39;heat&#39; is taken out of the debate,&quot; says Dr Mapp.</p>
