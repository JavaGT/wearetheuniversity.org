<p>Victoria University and Wellington College of Education Working Together to Develop Great Teachers</p>
<p>Graduates of Victoria University’s conjoint teacher education programme will be armed with a double degree, teaching experience and a world-class qualification when they enter their teaching careers.</p>
<p>The Education Review Office has recently expressed concern at the level of knowledge and support that new teachers have when they enter the workforce. Victoria is working to raise the standards of teachers in New Zealand by offering comprehensive teaching degree programmes targeted specifically at students who wish to enter the teaching profession.</p>
<p>The programmes, offered since 2002, allow students to draw on the strengths of both Victoria University and the Wellington College of Education, who will cement a century of co-operation if a proposed merger is approved by the Minister of Education to commence 1 January 2005.</p>
<p>Under the existing strategic alliance, the College was the first college to disband the three-year Bachelor of Education in favour of a four-year combination of a University degree (Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science or a Bachelor of Commerce) and a Bachelor of Teaching.</p>
<p>“Programmes cover the entire range of education from early childhood and primary through to secondary and our students benefit from studying in a research-rich environment while also developing the skills to teach this knowledge to their students,” says Dugald Scott, Principal of the Wellington College of Education.</p>

<p>“Under the proposed merger, the University will also be providing focused programmes for beginning teachers, which will assist them to continue to developing knowledge and the skills to promote the achievement of their students. The support services provided will help schools develop effective systems to support new teachers.”</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon says more than 250 students are enrolled in the four-year programme, and should complete their qualifications within the next couple of years.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to seeing our graduates enter the workplace with a wide range of skills and qualifications that should equip them to work in classrooms throughout New Zealand.”</p>
<p>As part of the proposed merger process, the University plans to establish a College of Education consisting of four Schools and a Faculty of Education to oversee the academic programmes taught by the Schools.</p>
