<p><strong>Thursday, 9 September 2004, 11:10 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association">Victoria University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Vice Chancellor childish in face of student opposition to fee increases</p>
<p>Victoria University students are calling on their Vice Chancellor to spend more time considering the effects of his unnecessary fee increases and less time on the minutiae of the fee setting meeting.</p>
<p>The students are responding to a letter from the VC banning students from bringing school bags into this afternoon&#39;s Council meeting, where he intends raising 2005 fees by 4.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Stuart McCutcheon&#39;s behaviour is childish and petty when compared to the wider issue of hardship and student debt,&quot; said Amanda Hill, President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students&#39; Association. &quot;Once again, he wants to avoid facing up to the people that will be affected by fee increases.&quot;</p>
<p>Victoria University Council will meet at 4pm today to set fees for 2005. The Vice Chancellor has proposed a 4.5 percent fee increase despite strong opposition from University staff and students.</p>
<p>&quot;The Vice Chancellor&#39;s attempts to ban schoolbags from the Council meeting is the sort of rules pre-school children are subject to,&quot; said Hill. &quot;However, unlike Vic students, school students don&#39;t face huge debts for their education.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Students are angry about the Vice Chancellor&#39;s proposal to raise student fees by 4.5 percent and will be making this clear to the Council meeting this afternoon, with or without our school bags,&quot; said Hill.</p>
<p>&quot;Student members of the Council are hopeful that the Vice Chancellor and other members of Council will come to their senses before this afternoons meeting and vote for fee reductions instead of unjustified fee hikes,&quot; said Hill.</p>
