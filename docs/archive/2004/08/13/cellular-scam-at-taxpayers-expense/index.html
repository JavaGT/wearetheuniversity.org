<p>Cellular Scam At Taxpayers&#39; Expense</p>
<p>Friday 13 Aug 2004</p>
<p>Deborah Coddington - Press Releases - Education</p>
<p>Only an irresponsible Minister, from a financially irresponsible Government, could believe that dishing out free cell phones to Open Polytechnic students is a sensible use of taxpayer money, ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Today I revealed that up to 12,000 correspondence students, enrolled in the Polytech&#39;s $23 million `Lifeworks&#39; course, each received a free cell phone - courtesy of the Kiwi taxpayer,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;Taxpayers will be angry that they are, not only paying for a free course with questionable outcomes but also, forking out their hard-earned dollars on cell phones that may or may not be used for the purpose intended.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey appears to be more interested in putting more bums on seats by offering inducements - like cell phones - for people to enrol in airy fairy, feel good courses, that allow him to boast how many people are participating in tertiary education, than providing them with a quality education that leads to a job upon completion of the course.</p>
<p>&quot;Spending millions on such courses and free cell phones, in addition to the Tertiary Education Commission&#39;s findings last week that the Christchurch Polytech offered inducements to students to enrol in a computer course, highlights Mr Maharey&#39;s poor handling of his portfolio.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister is treating hard-working taxpayers with contempt. He is wasting their money, driving our tertiary education sector into the ground and making it a laughing stock. Mr Maharey should stop hiding behind the polytechs and take some responsibility - a good start would be for him to resign,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
