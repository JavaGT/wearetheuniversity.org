<p>Bill English</p>
<p>National Education Spokesman</p>
<p>13 August 2004</p>
<p>Time to come clean on NCEA</p>
<p>It&#39;s time to come clean about the significant problems with the NCEA and get on with fixing them so students, parents and employers can have confidence in qualifications, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>His comments follow the resignation of Alison Annan, principal of Cambridge High School.</p>
<p>Her resignation came out of a threat by the NZQA to withdraw their accreditation from the school after it was proven that &#39;credit-cramming&#39; was common practice.</p>
<p>&quot;The problems at Cambridge High School were at the extreme end of the scale but are indicative of wider problems with the NCEA,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;The NZQA have finally accepted that their system allows credit-cramming and unreliable assessment. Now they must follow through so that every secondary school in the country understands they won&#39;t get away with letting their students down by churning out credits with little or no educational value.</p>
<p>&quot;NZQA&#39;s actions today confirm that the qualification is in desperate need of a shake-up.</p>
<p>&quot;National will support any measures that ensure our students receive quality qualifications,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
