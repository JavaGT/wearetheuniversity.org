<p>Dr Wayne Mapp - National Associate Spokesman for Treaty and Constitutional Issues</p>
<p>31 August 2004</p>
<p>University must condemn &#39;civil war&#39; statement</p>
<p>National&#39;s associate spokesman for Treaty and Constitutional Issues says the University of Auckland must distance itself from the extreme and divisive comments of one of its senior professors.</p>
<p>In a submission to the select committee looking into the proposed foreshore and seabed legislation, Professor Margaret Mutu said that the proposals would lead &#39;inevitably to civil war&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;On questioning Professor Mutu was adamant that a Palestinian-style insurrection would break out in the North with all the violence that that entails,&quot; says Dr Mapp.</p>
<p>Professor Mutu is a senior academic at the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been six days since she made these comments. Her statement has been condemned by everyone except her employer who has declined to comment.</p>
<p>&quot;The university has a responsibility not only to distance itself from these remarks but to condemn them.</p>
<p>&quot;One wonders what kind of message she is giving to her students.</p>
<p>&quot;When similar comments were made by the Chief Executive of the Maori Language Commission, the Commission was quick to condemn them and an apology was forthcoming.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re on a slippery slope if our premier academic institution allows its own staff to make such dangerous and inflammatory statements without consequences,&quot; says Dr Mapp.</p>
