<p>Hon Bill English</p>
<p>National Education Spokesman</p>
<p>11 August 2004</p>
<p>Community Education Investigation - at last</p>
<p>After months of pressure, Steve Maharey has finally agreed to an investigation into shady community education courses at polytechs around the country, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>But Mr English says the real issue is financial accountability.</p>
<p>In response to a parliamentary question this afternoon, the Minister responsible for Tertiary Education has confirmed that he will extend his investigation to cover a further $80 million worth of taxpayer-funded courses.</p>
<p>A recent investigation into Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (CPIT) showed that millions of dollars were spent on courses in violation of government regulations.</p>
<p>&quot;The CPIT investigation found that 13,000 students didn&#39;t fit the funding criteria because the Polytech can&#39;t prove that they completed the course or even began it,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Other polytechs are now in the spotlight for similar violations. I suspect Tairawhiti will have serious trouble proving that the 46,000 students enrolled in its radio sing-a-long course even turned on the radio.</p>
<p>&quot;But the Minister has been forced to rely on CPIT&#39;s good-will to get any of the money back.</p>
<p>&quot;An investigation is all well and good but the real issue is accountability. At present, the Tertiary Education Commission has no jurisdiction to claim the funds back.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister must take urgent action to ensure that polytechs that break the rules pay the price,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
