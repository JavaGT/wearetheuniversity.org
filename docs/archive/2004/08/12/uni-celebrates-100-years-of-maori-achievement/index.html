<p>UNIVERSITY CELEBRATES 100 YEARS OF MAORI ACHIEVEMENT AT OTAGO</p>
<p>The life and achievements of the University of Otago’s first Mäori graduate Te Rangi Hïroa (Sir Peter Buck) are at the heart of week-long celebrations to begin on 16 August to mark the centenary of Mäori education at Otago.</p>
<p>An exhibition showcasing artefacts and items collected by Te Rangi Hïroa, whose career spanned medicine and anthropology, will open at the Otago Museum on 19 August and is the &quot;jewel in the crown&quot; of the celebrations, says University Mäori Affairs Advisor Darryn Russell.</p>
<p>&quot;It’s an absolutely stunning display of artefacts, and includes materials from Hawai`i’ s Bishop Museum, where Te Rangi Hïroa was Director for a significant part of his career.&quot; The exhibition, Te Raukura, is hosted jointly by the University and Otago Museum and will be opened at 6.30pm by the Governor General, Dame Silvia Cartwright. The event will be preceded by a pöwhiri at 1pm at Otäkau Marae, where Ngäi Tahu will extend a traditional welcome to visitors, including representatives from Te Rangi Hïroa’s iwi Ngäti Mutunga (Taranaki) and from Ngäti Porou (East Coast) which has a close association with the University.</p>
<p>The taonga (treasures) from the Bishop Museum include Te Rangi Hïroa’s korowai (cloak) and his taiaha and mere (ceremonial weapons), as well as items he collected and hand-written manuscripts. A group from the University’s Te Tumu (School of Mäori, Pacific and Indigenous Studies), including Professor Tänia Ka’ai, went to the Museum in Honolulu, with the support of the Ngäi Tahu Advisory Committee to the Otago Museum, to ensure the materials were received and transported according to Hawai`ian and Mäori protocol.</p>

<p>&quot;We were called into the museum with a cultural welcome,&quot; says Professor Ka’ai. &quot;It was a very moving experience to go and see the collection and to hear stories about Te Rangi Hïroa from Pat Namaka Bacon who had worked closely with him for a number of years.&quot;</p>
<p>In other events to mark the week, a Memorandum of Understanding will be signed at 10am on Friday 20 August by the University and Ngäti Porou, formalising the longstanding relationship which offers practicum opportunities on the East Coast to medical students.</p>
<p>At 1pm that day, a Mäori pre-graduation ceremony will be held to honour the success of Mäori students who are graduating, including five with doctorates . They are Anna Carr, PhD in tourism (Ngä Puhi, Ngäti Ruanui), Lauren Harcourt, PhD in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (Ngäi Tahu), Rawinia Higgins, PhD Mäori Studies (Tühoe, Ngäi Tahu), Jane Kitson, PhD Zoology (Ngäi Tahu, Ngäti Mamoe) and Jim Williams, PhD Geography (Ngäi Tahu, Ngäti Mamoe).</p>
<p>At the formal graduation ceremony at 2pm, Saturday 21 August, an honorary doctorate will be conferred on Dr Paratene Ngata for his commitment to the health and wellbeing of Mäori. Dr Ngata will also be guest speaker at the ceremony.</p>
<p>The events, organised by the University, have been accompanied by a programme which continues throughout the year, where the University’s Schools and Departments have initiated their own events to mark the centenary.</p>
