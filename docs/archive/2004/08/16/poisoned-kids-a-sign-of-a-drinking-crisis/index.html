<p>Poisoned kids a sign of a drinking culture in crisis</p>
<p>Green MP Nandor Tanczos says the doubling of hospitalisations of 10 to 14-year-olds for alcohol poisoning is very distressing but insists the blame does not rest with 18 and 19-year-olds.</p>
<p>Hospital data, released today by Alcohol Healthwatch, shows there were 57 cases of alcohol poisoning in 10 to 14-year-olds between 2000-02, compared to 28 cases in 1997-99.</p>
<p>“The age limit is 18, so if 10 to 14-year-olds are getting hold of alcohol then the problem is the law not being enforced, not the law itself,” said Nandor, the Green Party’s Youth Affairs and Drug Law Reform Spokesperson.</p>
<p>“Alac’s research shows that under-age drinkers are not getting alcohol from their 18 and 19-year-old siblings, they’re usually getting it from their parents. Meanwhile a Massey University report recently showed that 56 per cent of liquor sales to 18-year-olds were completed without the need for identification, indicating that under-age drinkers are finding it easy to buy alcohol, regardless of the legal age limit.</p>
<p>“Where do young people get the idea that they can find happiness in excess? Everyone is told by advertising that alcohol makes you cool and by New Zealand’s culture that binging shows you’re staunch.</p>
<p>“A doubling in the numbers of 10 to 14-year-olds landing up in hospital with alcohol poisoning should be seen as a sign that our overall binge drinking culture has reached crisis point. Who perpetuates and benefits from this dysfunctional situation? Certainly not people in their late teens.</p>

<p>“The solution to the issue of under-age drinking is a ban on all alcohol advertising, proper enforcement of the current law and a systematic effort to change the culture; not excluding drinking alcohol from the list of legal rights and responsibilities you take on when you turn 18.</p>
<p>“For Progressive Party leader Jim Anderton to say that lowering the drinking age sent the wrong message so it should be raised again, even though he admits that that won’t fix the actual problem, begs the question: what message will returning to an age limit of 20 send?</p>
<p>“I suggest such a move would tell 18 and 19-year-olds that they aren’t trusted by their society and that adults blame them for something that is really not their fault.</p>
<p>“The Youth Parliament is this week debating the raising of the drinking age. I call on Youth MPs to consider the overall picture and their own experiences of their peers’ attitudes and reject the calls from those adults who aren’t willing to tackle the real issues,” said Nandor.</p>
