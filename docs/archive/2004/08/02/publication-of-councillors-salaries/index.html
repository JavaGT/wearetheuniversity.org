<p><strong>Monday, 2 August 2004, 12:16 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Richard Northey, Labour Councillor and candidate for Auckland City Council, says the publication of Councillors’ salaries highlights the opportunities lost by Tamaki/Maungakiekie’s Councillors Abbott and Christian to serve their constituents.</p>
<p>“They have both failed as independents by backing every major proposal pushed by the Council of John Banks. Sale of pensioner housing, cuts to community services, and large increases in user charges are among the measures they have supported.”</p>
<p>“I am sure that with elections coming up they will be making efforts to highlight the occasional time they voted against the Banks team.”</p>
<p>“In fact, voters are aware that it is morally dubious to benefit the wealthy by targeting middle and low-income households. Claiming to be independent at the same time is doubly wrong.”</p>
<p>In support, fellow candidate and former ARC Councillor Jack Henderson noted that the consistent 12-8 majority for Banks’ team from 2001-2004 has included the two.</p>
<p>“That majority has sold 1700 council houses, made a 20% cut in the annual events budget, and cut provision for parks.”</p>
<p>“Effective rates increases for low-valued houses have been 37%, medium-value 21%, and high value only 4.3%. This transfer of wealth has affected tenants as well as resident owners.”</p>
<p>“This is all on record. So are the low rate rises for those in low and medium valued homes and better services from both Auckland City and the ARC from 1998 to 2001, at a time when there were more Labour and City Vision Councillors on these bodies.”</p>
