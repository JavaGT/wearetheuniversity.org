<p>Maori Students’ Stance Bizarre Says Jones</p>
<p>New Zealand First MP Dail Jones is trying to work out how Maori student leaders can reject the sovereignty of Parliament yet make submissions to the select committee dealing with the foreshore and seabed legislation.</p>
<p>Mr Jones, a member of the committee, said he was amazed that the National Maori Students Association seemed to be living in some kind of pre-1840 state and had not accepted that New Zealand was now a 21st century democracy.</p>
<p>“You have to wonder where the leaders of the future are coming from if a national students association group does not support the sovereignty of Parliament in New Zealand!</p>
<p>“They seem to be quite happy to accept the benefits of the system but not the system which brings the benefits. It really is an odd situation but, to be fair, they might eventually learn that we have moved on from the fourteenth century,” said Mr Jones.</p>
