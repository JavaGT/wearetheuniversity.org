<p>Women Add Further Depth To Great Race Day</p>
<p>A high-level clash between the women&#39;s rowing eights of Waikato University and Australian national champions Melbourne University will be a feature of Hamilton&#39;s Great Race day on 4 September.</p>
<p>The women will compete for a new Bryan Gould Cup, named after Waikato University&#39;s current Vice-Chancellor who retires at the end of the year. The trophy will in future be up for grabs on annual Great Race days in contests between a Waikato women&#39;s crew and an invited overseas or New Zealand crew.</p>
<p>&quot;A Waikato University women&#39;s crew has raced an NZ Rowing academy crew as a curtain raiser to the main event in each of the past two years,&quot; says Mark Ingle, general manager of the university&#39;s Campus Services. &quot;But the women&#39;s team has been keen for some time to emulate the men&#39;s crew with some crack international competition as part of the Great Race day and this has now been achieved.</p>
<p>&quot;The Waikato University Rowing Club gained a prompt acceptance of its invitation to Melbourne, which has a very strong women&#39;s eight, being top in Australia at present.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the Waikato eight will include Bess Halley, Jaime Nielson and Darnelle Timbs, who were part of the NZ under-23 quad crew that won the world under-23 title in Poland recently. So, clearly, with three world champions in our boat, it&#39;s shaping up into a great contest.&quot;</p>
<p>The main event on Great Race day is the clash between the Waikato University men&#39;s eight and a crew from Britain&#39;s Cambridge University. Each year, Waikato races either Cambridge or Oxford University for the Harry Mahon Memorial Trophy.</p>
