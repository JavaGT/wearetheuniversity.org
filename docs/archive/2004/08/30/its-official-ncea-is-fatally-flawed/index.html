<p>It&#39;s Official: NCEA Is Fatally Flawed</p>
<p>Monday 30 Aug 2004</p>
<p>Deborah Coddington - Press Releases - Education</p>
<p>If the recent debacle over Cambridge High School isn&#39;t enough proof for Education Minister Trevor Mallard, then a weekend newspaper ad should finally convince him that the NCEA must go, ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;None other than Otago University Education Faculty&#39;s Associate Professor Howard Lee has gone public with the truth that parents and teachers have known for months: NCEA is fatally flawed,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;Professor Lee calls the system an &#39;experiment&#39;, and says that New Zealand children are &#39;guinea pigs&#39;. These are exactly the words ACT has been using for years.</p>
<p>&quot;NCEA is all about credits and nothing about knowledge. It is a funnel through which we attempt to force our brightest, middle and least able students in a socialist attempt to have them all come out the same.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn&#39;t work. It has never worked. It will never work, and ACT would allow schools to dump the NCEA. The last National Government introduced this system - despite it being totally discredited overseas. What would National do now?</p>
<p>&quot;ACT will bring back standards and national exams so students, parents, universities and employers have a qualification they can trust,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
