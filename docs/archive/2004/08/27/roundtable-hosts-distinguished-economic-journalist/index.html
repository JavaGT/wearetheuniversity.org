<p>Business Roundtable Hosts Distinguished Economic Journalist and Education Policy Expert</p>
<p>For 10 days from September 1 the New Zealand Business Roundtable will host Martin Wolf, one of the world&#39;s most respected economic journalists, and his wife Alison Wolf, education policy expert.</p>
<p>Martin Wolf is the associate editor and chief economics commentator at the Financial Times and the author of the newly released book Why Globalisation Works (Yale University Press, 2004). A Foreign Affairs review said Wolf&#39;s &quot;sharp insights&quot; on the trade liberalisation debate &quot;score a major victory against critics of globalization&quot;. The president of Harvard University said, &quot;This brilliant book should be read by anybody who cares about the future of the developing world.&quot;</p>
<p>Martin Wolf will deliver the Sir Ronald Trotter Lecture 2004 on September 2. The topic of his dinner lecture at the Carlton Hotel in Auckland will be The Role of the State in an Era of Globalisation. Tickets to the dinner lecture may be purchased on the New Zealand Business Roundtable website at <a href="http://www.nzbr.org.nz">www.nzbr.org.nz</a> .</p>
<p>Alison Wolf has evaluated education policies for the US Congress and has published widely on education and the labour market, and on assessment, qualifications and skills. Until 2003 she directed the International Centre for Research on Assessment at the University of London&#39;s Institute of Education.</p>
<p>In her book Does Education Matter? Myths about education and economic growth (Penguin, 2002), she examined the gap between the rhetoric and reality of education.</p>

<p>Alison Wolf will deliver a seminar on the topic Does Education Matter at the Portrait Gallery, Bowen House, Wellington, at 17.30 on September 8. The event is free, but attendees are asked to email <a href="mailto:sbila@awaroa.com">sbila@awaroa.com</a> to indicate their intention to attend. Information is at the Education Forum website: <a href="http://www.educationforum.org.nz">www.educationforum.org.nz</a> .</p>
<p>New Zealand Business Roundtable executive director Roger Kerr said he was delighted that Martin Wolf would deliver the Sir Ronald Trotter Lecture 2004.</p>
<p>&quot;In his writing, Wolf has consistently offered a powerful intellectual critique of the arguments against globalisation, and an optimistic view of the economic and political outlook for the world. With Francis Fukuyama and Bjorn Lomborg delivering this lecture in the past two years, a high standard has been maintained and I am certain that Martin Wolf will provide a stimulating and provocative address&quot;, Mr Kerr said.</p>
<p>Interview requests for either Martin Wolf or Alison Wolf should be directed to David Young , New Zealand Business Roundtable and Education Forum communications advisor: <a href="mailto:dyoung@nzbr.org.nz">dyoung@nzbr.org.nz</a></p>
