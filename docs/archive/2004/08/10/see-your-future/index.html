<p>See your future</p>
<p>Thinking about your future? Well you aren&#39;t alone - and to help you make informed decisions, The University of Auckland is organising its annual Courses and Careers Day on Saturday August 28.</p>
<p>Thousands of prospective students are expected to check out future study options at Courses and Careers Day. The aim of the event is to provide an opportunity for students and their families to learn about the range of undergraduate courses available at the University.</p>
<p>Schools Partnership Office Director Colin Prentice says Courses and Careers Day is a once a year opportunity for students to come and find out what the University is all about.</p>
<p>Mr Prentice says the best way to make a decision about where to study is &quot;to go and see&quot; and then make decisions.</p>
<p>&quot;Visiting the University is different from hearing or reading about it. You get a feel for it and your place within it.&quot;</p>
<p>The event lets prospective students see the University&#39;s facilities, talk to current students and hear about study and career options directly from lecturers and future employers.</p>
<p>A wide range of activities, interactive sessions, tours of accommodation facilities and lectures will give visitors a taste of what university study is like. Some of the highlights include: the opportunity to be an architect for an hour; experiencing law in action; writing names in Greek and Hebrew; and a tour of the Kate Edger Information Commons, a state-of-the-art student learning facility with 1000 study and 600 computer spaces. Student cafes will be open for business and free entertainment will also be provided throughout the day.</p>

<p>Although Courses and Careers Day is aimed at senior school students and their parents, Mr Prentice says this year&#39;s event has been extended to include a special Year 10 event with free BBQ, lectures and presentations. This will give younger students the flavour of university study and life.</p>
<p>Some 50 free buses will be running throughout Auckland and also from Whangarei, Hamilton, Rotorua and Tauranga, to help students travel to the University.</p>
