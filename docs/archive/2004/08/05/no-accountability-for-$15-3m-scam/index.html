<p>No accountability for $15.3m scam</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesman Bill English says Steve Maharey has turned a blind eye to a $15.3 million funding scam at Christchurch Polytechnic.</p>
<p>&quot;Maharey can&#39;t even slap a wet bus ticket on management who have ruthlessly exploited the funding system and the government officials who let it happen.</p>
<p>&quot;The Tertiary Education Commission&#39;s report into CPIT, released today, shows that Steve Maharey and the commission have effectively endorsed CPIT&#39;s collection of $15.3 million of taxpayers money for a CD-based course with no assessment, no supervision and no qualification.</p>
<p>The report shows:</p>
<p>* CPIT set out to deliberately exploit funding loopholes before they were closed. [PAR 32,102]</p>
<p>* Only 3% of enrolled students are known to have completed the course. That&#39;s $30,815 for each of the 603 students who completed the course. [PAR 65]</p>
<p>* The Government payment for the course is so large that CPIT made a profit of 92 cents in every dollar of taxpayer revenue. [EXEC SUM 10 (F)</p>
<p>* Of the 18,000 enrolments, 13,000 did not fit the Government&#39;s funding criteria, but no action will be taken. [PAR 66, 69, 71]</p>
<p>* Senior TEC and Ministry officials knew about CPIT&#39;s plans and endorsed them. [PAR 125-128, 139]</p>
<p>* CPIT&#39;s only teaching input was a 7-10 minute introductory course. [PAR 63]</p>
<p>&quot;Effectively, they set out to harvest EFTS to improve their financial position. CPIT rapidly generated a network of people they paid to help them enrol thousands of students ahead of a Christmas deadline. Whether or not these students would actually complete the course appears never to have been a consideration,&quot; says Mr English.</p>

<p>&quot;Even though the report tries to brush over this shambles, there is enough evidence for Steve Maharey to take strong measures of accountability. Repayment of $80,000 is not enough. The polytech&#39;s council must be held to account.</p>
<p>&quot;The public rely on professionalism in the tertiary sector and a Minister with the ability and willingness to crack down on bad behaviour but, in this case, there is a complete failure of accountability,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
