<p>Smith&#39;s Bill Unprincipled, Says Eckhoff</p>
<p>Thursday 5 Aug 2004</p>
<p>Gerry Eckhoff - Press Releases - Rural - Public Access Petition</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Rural Affairs Spokesman Gerry Eckhoff today said Dr Nick Smith&#39;s Private Members Bill would better reflect the Greens&#39; or Progressive Party&#39;s phobia over foreign investment, than that of a senior member of the National Party.</p>
<p>&quot;It is extraordinary that the National Party, once based on property rights and private enterprise, could sanction such overt abuse of those who wish to enjoy and contribute to our country,&quot; Mr Eckhoff said.</p>
<p>&quot;Under this Bill, any rural landowner - wishing to sell land to foreigners - must first relinquish to the Government any part of that land which faces the water&#39;s edge. While the foreign buyer will be compensated for the loss, the New Zealand buyer won&#39;t be.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Smith, a keen tramper and hiker, seems to believe that farmers wishing to sell or retire should accept a devalued price for their land because he demands access to other people&#39;s property.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Smith&#39;s Bill covers all land where a water body exists, not just coastal land. Inland streams, rivers and lakes will have to be `laid off&#39;. Not only do foreign investors have to apply to the Overseas Investment Commission, they will now lose the `quiet enjoyment&#39; every landowner is entitled to.</p>
<p>&quot;This unprincipled Bill will affect thousands of New Zealand landowners, and could well devalue their land by reducing the number of potential buyers - including overseas purchasers wishing to reside in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Smith should reflect on the fact that his family was once `foreign&#39;. Perhaps he should make the Bill retrospective?</p>
<p>&quot;What amazes me is that National Party Leader Don Brash voted with the rest of his Caucus for this Bill. I had previously thought that he was in favour of property rights,&quot; Mr Eckhoff said.</p>
