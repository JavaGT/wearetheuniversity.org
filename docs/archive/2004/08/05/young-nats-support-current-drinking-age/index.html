<p>Young Nats support current drinking age</p>
<p>&quot;The drinking age should remain at 18, no exceptions,&quot; says New Zealand Young Nationals Chairman, Jamie Simpson.</p>
<p>&quot;Lack of responsibility by parents, and individuals making poor choices are why more young people are going to drink, regardless of the legal age. These are the real problems that need addressing. Increasing the age to 20 is not the solution.</p>
<p>&quot;The Progressives, NZ First, and United Future are wrong in their calls for the drinking age to be raised. They must look deeper, into issues relating to parenting, New Zealand&#39;s drinking culture, and most importantly - enforcement,&quot; says Mr Simpson.</p>
<p>&quot;Both the sellers of alcohol and the buyers need to take more responsibility and be held accountable for their actions.&quot;</p>
<p>These comments are made in light of a recent Massey University study showing some Auckland bottle shops, supermarkets and grocery stores were not asking for identification.</p>
<p>&quot;The revised drinking age law was introduced in 1999 to bring New Zealand into line with other age-based rights that we have in our country,&quot; says Jamie Simpson</p>
<p>&quot;There are much bigger issues affecting young people in this country, such as, the &#39;P&#39; epidemic, growing student debt, and the uncertain future created by a Government that treats people differently on the basis of their race,&quot; says Mr Simpson.</p>
