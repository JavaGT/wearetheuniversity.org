<p>Details of a Waikato University Law and security after September 11 seminar.</p>
<p>5 August 2004</p>
<p>The Changing Rules Of War</p>
<p>The changing rules regarding war and the stability of international safeguards against war are the focus of a talk by Waikato University School of Law professor Al Gillespie, who is speaking next week at a Law and Security after September 11 seminar.</p>
<p>His talk is entitled The Laws of War in the 21st Century.</p>
<p>&quot;The main theme of my talk is that the laws of war are in a state of flux - from the reasons we condone the invasion of countries through to the weapons we authorise for use - and that many of the safeguards that the international community built up over the last five decades are currently very wobbly,&quot; says Professor Gillespie, the 2004 NZ Law Foundation International Research Fellow.</p>
<p>Prof Gillespie&#39;s fields of expertise include the laws of armed conflict and international environmental law.</p>
<p>The other speaker at the seminar is Dr Rodney Harrison, leading counsel for Ahmed Zaoui. His talk is entitled New Zealand and the War on Terrorism: Domestic Responses.</p>
<p>The seminar is being held at 5.45pm at the WEL Energy Trust Academy of Performing Arts on Wednesday 11 August. Seating is limited.</p>
