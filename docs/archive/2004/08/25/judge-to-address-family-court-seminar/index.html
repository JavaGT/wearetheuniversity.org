<p><strong>Wednesday, 25 August 2004, 9:38 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Judge to address Family Court seminar</p>
<p>The role of the Family Court will be the focus of debate at a one-day seminar on Monday 30 August, organised in association with Victoria University’s Roy McKenzie Centre for the Study of Families and hosted by the New Zealand Psychological Association.</p>
<p>Issues for the Family Court will open with a presentation from Principal Family Court Judge Peter Boshier, who will discuss his view of future directions in the Court, including openness, the participation of children, the role of court professionals and other changes signalled in the impending Care of Children Bill.</p>
<p>Director of the Roy McKenzie Centre for the Study of Families, Associate Professor Jan Pryor, says the seminar has been planned to coincide with the upcoming policy changes.</p>
<p>“It’s very timely, and there is a substantial amount of material in relation to policy changes that affect the Family Court that we will be addressing during the day.</p>
<p>“These issues should be of great interest to all those involved in the Family Court process, including psychologists, councillors, lawyers, media and non-government organisations such as Relationship Services.”</p>
<p>Associate Professor Pryor, an expert on family conflict and change, will give her own presentation on issues in legal parenthood, such as surrogacy and civil unions.</p>
<p>Other speakers at the seminar include national and international experts in child and family psychology. Subjects include an education programme for separated parents involved in child custody cases, a study of report writing within the Family Court, and a case study of a recent High Court appeal on access to interview data.</p>
