<p><strong>Wednesday, 25 August 2004, 11:49 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Global accountancy experts on their way to Victoria</p>
<p>A scheme to attract the world’s top accountancy experts to Victoria University is being launched on Tuesday 31 August as a tribute to a professor known as New Zealand’s “Mr Accounting”.</p>
<p>Professor Don Trow, who has had a distinguished career as both an accountant and lecturer, is being honoured by a new visiting fellowships fund established in his name by Victoria’s School of Accounting and Commercial Law, with funding from the business community through the Victoria University Foundation. The sponsors are Telecom, Fonterra, Westpac, Wellington City Council and New Zealand Post.</p>
<p>The guests of honour at the fellowship’s official launch will be Rt Hon Jim Bolger, ONZ, Chairman of New Zealand Post and Kiwibank, and leading company director Sir Ron Trotter.</p>
<p>The Don Trow Visiting Fellowships in Accounting Research will allow international specialists in accounting to visit the School during July and August each year, to coincide with the northern universities’ summer vacation. The Fellows will become involved in the School’s research programmes, conduct seminars and work as consultants within the university and the wider business community.</p>
<p>Professor Trow says the fellowship will have “tremendous benefits” for the university.</p>
<p>“It’s increasingly important for learning institutions to keep pace with global research developments in our field, so having international accountancy experts spend time in the School on a regular basis is going to be fantastic. I’m delighted to be associated with these Fellowships and look forward to meeting the first visitors next year. “</p>
<p>Dean of Commerce and Administration, Professor Pat Walsh, says the establishment of the Fellowships shows how serious the School is about growing its research culture.</p>
<p>“The School of Accounting and Commercial Law strives to become New Zealand’s premier centre for Accounting Research, conducting research of benefit to the local, national and international business and professional communities.</p>
<p>&#39;”In addition, this research underpins the teaching of the accounting programmes at Victoria, ensuring that our students also benefit from it.”</p>
<p>Professor Trow, who officially retired last year after 40 years lecturing at Victoria, is still involved with the university, chiefly by teaching 100-level classes. He is also a big part of the business community, as Chairman of the new market enforcement board NZX Discipline, Director of Ryman Healthcare Ltd, and a frequent expert witness on court cases regarding accounting and taxation. In 2003, he was made a Life Member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Media are invited to attend the launch of the Don Trow Visiting Fellowship in Accounting Research on Tuesday 31 August, at 5.30 pm. Lecture Theatre 1, Rutherford House, 23 Lambton Quay, Pipitea Campus, Victoria University. RSVP to (04) 463 5078 or <a href="mailto:barbara.cordes@vuw.ac.nz">barbara.cordes@vuw.ac.nz</a>.  </p>
