<p><strong>Wednesday, 25 August 2004, 3:30 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions">New Zealand Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p>MEDIA RELEASE<br>25 August 2004</p>
<p>Small Business Report<br>Badly-Informed and Unfair</p>
<p>The Council of Trade Unions has reacted angrily to the Small Business Advisory Group proposals to make it easier to sack employees and to deprive newly-employed workers of personal grievance rights.</p>
<p>The SBAG Report to Government released today has recommended that the legal procedures for dismissing non-performing staff be “rebalanced” and qualifying periods for personal grievances for probationary staff be provided.</p>
<p>“This proposal would strip tens of thousands of workers every year of all legal redress against their employers for personal grievances,” said CTU president Ross Wilson.</p>
<p>“That would include situations where there has been sexual harassment or discrimination against the worker.”</p>
<p>It appeared that the Group was not aware that the Employment Relations Act (s67) already provided for a probationary period for new workers, he said.</p>
<p>“Personal grievance rights are fundamental legal rights and the CTU will fight to protect them for all workers.</p>
<p>“Vulnerable workers in a new employment situation need more protection, not less.”</p>
<p>Small Business Minister John Tamihere should move over to the ACT Party if he is supporting proposals which are so blatantly anti-worker, Ross Wilson said.</p>
