<p>Dietetics Experts Unveil Latest Research On Diabetes, Cancer, At Nzda Conference</p>
<p>Dieticians from across New Zealand and around the world will be converging on the University of Otago next week, attending the New Zealand Dietetic Association conference. The conference runs from the 30th of August to 1 September, and features international speakers from Hawaii, Sweden, India and Australia.</p>
<p>Dr Laurence Kolonel from Hawaii is world-renowned for his multi-ethnic study into cancer incidence, looking particularly at the interaction between diet and genetic susceptibility. Dr Kolonel’s current research works with a sample group (cohort) of nearly 220,000 people from Hawaii and California, from a range of different ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p>Dr CJ Yanjik’s research focuses on foetal and infant origins of adult disease. He is a diabetologist at King Edward Memorial Hospital in Pune, India, and is also involved at editorial level in many diabetes publications for developing countries. In his keynote address he explores the link between maternal nutrition, foetal growth and the later development of type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Dr Annette Jarvi is a nutritional scientific advisor for Nestle in Sweden. Her recent research has been in the area of low Glycaemic index diets with high dietary fibre content, and how they impact on insulin resistance, which is a pre-diabetic state.</p>
<p>Professor Kerin O’Dea is Director of the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin. Since the late 70’s Professor O’Dea has been researching the impact of lifestyle changes on type 2 diabetes and other related conditions among indigenous Australians. Her present research focuses on diet and lifestyle in the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases.</p>
