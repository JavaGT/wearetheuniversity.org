<p>Honey for your ulcer</p>
<p>Leg ulcers are a major problem for many elderly people, but a new study hopes to confirm that manuka honey, which is readily available in most Kiwi homes is an effective treatment.</p>
<p>A team of researchers, led by Andrew Jull, a research fellow at The University of Auckland&#39;s Clinical Trials Research Unit in the School of Population Health, is conducting the study with funding from the Health Research Council of New Zealand.</p>
<p>With 400-patients involved, it will be the largest clinical trial of manuka honey for wound care ever funded, and one of the largest leg ulcer trials in the world.</p>
<p>Compression bandaging is the mainstay of treatment for most leg ulcers and the trial aims to determine whether a manuka honey dressing (plus compression bandaging) is more effective at healing leg ulcers compared to usual care (plus compression bandaging) at twelve weeks.</p>
<p>While the use of honey for healing is not uncommon, Mr Jull says there is little solid evidence on the effect of honey on ulcer healing.</p>
<p>&quot;Some research in burns does suggest that honey speeds up healing. However, the effect of honey remains unproven as a treatment for leg ulcers.</p>
<p>&quot;A randomised controlled trial will provide the best evidence about whether honey aids healing,&quot; says Mr Jull.</p>
<p>The Clinical Trials Research Unit, in The University of Auckland&#39;s School of Population Health, is spearheading the project which includes researchers from The University of Auckland, the University of Waikato and four district health boards.</p>

<p>The honey dressing has been supplied by Comvita New Zealand Ltd, Medical Division and the trial has also received support from USL Medical Ltd.</p>
<p>Patients from Central and South Auckland, Waikato and Christchurch are being recruited with the help of district nurses.</p>
<p>The trial has started and anyone with a leg ulcer interested in participating in the study should contact Mr Jull on 0800 783-764.</p>
