<p>Are Hunter-Gatherer Diets Better For You?</p>
<p>Reverting to traditional hunter-gatherer diet patterns can improve your health, according to research being presented at the New Zealand Dietetic Association conference this week.</p>
<p>Keynote speaker Professor Kerin O’Dea, Director of the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin, reports that even a temporary return to traditional hunter-gatherer diet and lifestyle has therapeutic potential in dealing with type 2 diabetes and cardio-vascular disease.</p>
<p>Professor O’Dea argues that her research has profound implications for the global epidemics of lifestyle and diet-related diseases such as diabetes and obesity. She says the type of food consumed, as well as the way it was prepared, were significant factors in making the diet a healthy one. The relative scarcity of food types that are energy-dense -- high in fats or sugars – was also a factor. These food types were highly prized in the traditional setting, and those preferences may have improved survival chances in ages past, but now these same preferences are a driving force for diet-related disease, she argues.</p>
<p>Professor O’Dea is just one of the international researchers presenting their findings at the NZDA conference, which is a vital training opportunity for New Zealand’s small and dispersed professional dieticians.  </p>
