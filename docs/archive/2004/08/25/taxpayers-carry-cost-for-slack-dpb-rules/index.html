<p><strong>Wednesday, 25 August 2004, 2:55 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Katherine Rich MP<br>National Party Social Services Spokeswoman</p>
<p>25 August 2004</p>
<p>Taxpayers carry cost for slack DPB rules</p>
<p>National Party Social Services spokeswoman Katherine Rich is accusing Work and Income of turning a blind eye to liable fathers and leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures I&#39;m releasing today show that nearly 20% of DPB recipients fail to name the father of their child and are subject to a Section 70A deduction.</p>
<p>&quot;However, official papers also reveal that in one in five of those cases, Work and Income does have the name of both parents on file.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes a mockery of the system that both parents can be named on a birth certificate, yet Work and Income turns a blind eye.</p>
<p>&quot;For one in five of those who are subject to a Section 70A deduction, Work and Income has the father&#39;s name on file, but the Government does not pursue payment.</p>
<p>&quot;The number of solo parents in that category has grown from 2,150 in May 2001 to 3,800 in July this year. Up a staggering 76%.</p>
<p>&quot;Taxpayers are being taken for a ride because of a soft welfare system that doesn&#39;t have simple checks and balances in place.</p>
<p>&quot;Surely if Work and Income already knows who the father is, it&#39;s a simple exercise to identify his responsibilities.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an issue the Government has been deliberately ignoring. The public were promised action last year, and we&#39;re still waiting.</p>
<p>&quot;According to official papers, the number of mothers who won&#39;t officially name the fathers of their children has increased from 13% in 2000, to 14.7% in 2002 and it was close to 18% in July 2004.</p>

<p>&quot;The issue is particularly serious among young women in the main North Island centres.</p>
<p>&quot;According to the figures, one in three Auckland women on the DPB between the ages of 16 and 24 have failed to name a liable father for child support payments.</p>
<p>&quot;In the Waikato the figure is 30%, in Wellington it&#39;s 25%, while on the East Coast and in Northland it&#39;s more than one in four,&quot; says Mrs Rich.</p>

<p>Question: Is Work and Income aware of any sole parent beneficiaries<br>subject to the section 70a penalty because they have elected not to apply for Child Support even though the liable parent is named, if so, what estimates have been made about the number of beneficiaries who are in this situation?</p>

<p>Answer Text: MSD officials completed research in relation to beneficiaries subject to a section 70A deduction in 2003.</p>
<p>This research suggests that approximately 21% of sole parent beneficiaries with a section 70A deduction had both parents’ details recorded by Work and Income.</p>
