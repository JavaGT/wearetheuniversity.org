<p>Management And Law Honours Student Wins Top Scholarship</p>
<p>Former Fraser High, Hamilton, student, Felicity Pryor is an aerobics instructor, netballer and a touch rugby player. She graduated from Waikato University in 2000 with honours in both her Bachelor of Management Studies degree from Waikato Management School and her law degree from the School of Law.</p>
<p>Now, working as a solicitor specialising in banking and financial law at Chapman Tripp in Auckland, she’s achieved further honours by being awarded an Association of Commonwealth Universities scholarship, which will allow her to do a Masters level degree in banking law at Britain’s Oxford University.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old is stoked about the opportunity the scholarship, worth the equivalent of about $60,000, is providing. “It’s a great chance to make a whole range of high-level academic and professional contacts in my area of specialty. I really appreciate the great support I’ve had from Waikato University in my scholarship application.”</p>
<p>Felicity says banking and finance is about far more than just dollars and cents and arcane rules and terminology.</p>
<p>”Economics, banking and finance clearly affect the lives of us all in some way. I enjoy the challenge of helping individuals and businesses to navigate their way through the law so that they can achieve success.”</p>
<p>After completing her study at Oxford, Felicity hopes to gain more commercial experience in Britain and the US before returning to further study and teaching in New Zealand.</p>
