<p>Packed Memorial Occasion For Sir Don Llewellyn</p>
<p>PACKED MEMORIAL OCCASION FOR SIR DON LLEWELLYN</p>
<p>Hundreds of people packed out a memorial occasion for the University of Waikato&#39;s founding Vice-Chancellor Sir Don Llewellyn today.</p>
<p>Sir Don, who was also instrumental in the establishment of NZ Fieldays, died just over a fortnight ago.</p>
<p>Friends, family and colleagues paid tribute to &quot;a great man&quot;.</p>
<p>Waikato&#39;s current Vice-Chancellor Professor Bryan Gould said: &quot;Don was a creator. He was an inspirer. And he remained a living force in the life of this university to the end of his days.&quot;</p>
<p>He noted that the last he saw of Sir Don was when he drove off in his car with the licence plate VCONE. &quot;That is how Don saw himself and that&#39;s how we will remember him.&quot;</p>
<p>His friend and former colleague Emeritus Professor John McCraw said Sir Don had always been determined that Waikato University would be &quot;no ivory tower&quot;.</p>
<p>Prof McCraw said Sir Don was &quot;scrupulously honest but not above a little deviousness, especially when dealing with officials&quot; and &quot;a dignified English gentleman who we shall miss greatly&quot;.</p>
<p>A moving aspect of the occasion was the participation of his grandchildren, who all read poems and played music in tribute to Sir Don.</p>
