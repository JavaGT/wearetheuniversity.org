<p>Lift Drinking Age Now Says NZ First</p>
<p>New Zealand First youth affairs spokesperson Craig McNair says the Government can no longer ignore the effects the lowered drinking age is having on teen drinking and it should raise it urgently.</p>
<p>A new Massey University study has found that 18-year-olds could buy alcohol without being asked for identification at more than half the 250 Auckland bottle shops, supermarkets and grocery stores they visited.</p>
<p>“More liquor outlets failed to request identification than last year, which indicates the Liquor Licensing Authority has failed to support enforcement of drinking laws and the Government’s promise to get tough on ID requirements was simply hot air,” said Mr McNair.</p>
<p>“Lowering the drinking age to 18 has allowed for younger and younger New Zealanders to gain easier access to alcohol, and has contributed to the worsening problem of teen boozing.</p>
<p>“The Government needs to accept that the decision to lower the drinking age was a terrible mistake, and should support New Zealand First’s members bill to raise the legal age back to 20 years,&quot; Mr McNair concluded.  </p>
