<p>24 August 2004</p>
<p>Ex-120kg prop now an 85kg high performance manager</p>
<p>Ex-Rotorua Boys High and Waikato under-19 rugby prop Glenn Barry was once a beefy 120kg.</p>
<p>Now, at a more slimline 85kg and competing in triathlons, Glenn has taken over as Waikato University&#39;s new high performance manager.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m responsible for helping the university&#39;s elite sportspeople perform well at both their studies and their sports. We have a range of top athletes here, including Olympians, and my job is to help them achieve their best.</p>
<p>&quot;Waikato University has a really strong commitment to helping top sportspeople perform while they&#39;re studying.&quot;</p>
<p>The Evers-Swindell twins, and other Athens Olympians, rowers George Bridgwater and Nathan Twaddle, shooter Nadine Stanton and cyclist Peter Latham are current or recent Waikato University students.</p>
<p>Glenn is well-qualified for his job. After leaving Rotorua, he obtained a degree in sport and leisure studies from Waikato. He&#39;s currently doing some post-graduate studies in the specialty area of prescribing exercise.</p>
<p>He mainly used exercise himself to shed the weight he needed to so that he could compete in his new found love of triathlons.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a real buzz. My aim now is to compete in next year&#39;s New Zealand Ironman.&quot;</p>
