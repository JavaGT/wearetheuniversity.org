<p>David Carter</p>
<p>National Member of Parliament</p>
<p>24 March 2004</p>
<p>&#39;Extremely unsafe environment&#39; no place for kids</p>
<p>Revelations that a Christchurch school has advised parents that it is an &quot;extremely unsafe environment&quot; requires immediate action from the Minister of Education, says local National MP David Carter.</p>
<p>The Maori immersion school - Te Kura Whakapumau I Te Reo Tuuturu Ki Waitaha - has written to parents warning of rife bullying, theft and fighting among the students.</p>
<p>&quot;It is fundamental to our education system that when parents deliver their children to school they know they will be cared for in a safe atmosphere that fosters learning,&quot; says Mr Carter.</p>
<p>&quot;The school&#39;s management is obviously in chaos. The principal denies that<br>pupils are in danger, yet the school newsletter is absolutely explicit, describing the school as an &quot;extremely unsafe environment&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister of Education has spent the past six months promoting the closure of schools, many of which were capably delivering education, yet has no comment on this school.</p>
<p>&quot;Is this another example of one standard for Maori education and another for non-Maori?&quot;, asks Mr Carter</p>
