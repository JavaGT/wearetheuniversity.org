<p>Greens call for ban on risky anti-depressants</p>
<p>Green MP Sue Kedgley is calling on the Minister of Health to direct Medsafe to prohibit GPs from prescribing potentially dangerous anti-depressants to children and teenagers.</p>
<p>&quot;Frankly, Medsafe&#39;s unwillingness to ban the prescribing of SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) anti-depressants to children under the age of 18 is inexplicable,&quot; said Ms Kedgley, the Green Party&#39;s Health spokesperson. &quot;It is particularly concerning in light of evidence that about 25,000 prescriptions are dispensed each year for under-18s, a 60 per cent increase since 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;One has to ask whether the interests of drug companies are being put ahead of public health. Here we have an anti-depressant drug which overseas experts say is potentially damaging for young people, increases their risk of suicide and aggression, and is not even helpful or useful in treating depression.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All SSRI&#39;s except Prozac are prohibited from sale to under 18-year-olds in the UK, and severely restricted in the USA. Why wont our government take a similar precautionary approach?&quot; Ms Kedgley asked.</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley said Medsafe had failed to protect public health by at least requiring drug companies to put prominent warnings on the drug&#39;s label.</p>
<p>&quot;Medsafe has done nothing to warn New Zealanders that SSRI anti-depression drugs have been established as causing suicide. &quot;It has done nothing to protect the thousands of unsuspecting New Zealanders who, in good faith, have been consuming these drugs believing them to be safe and effective.&quot;</p>

<p>Ms Kedgley said Medsafe&#39;s claim that it had not approved the drug for young people in New Zealand was not credible. &quot;Medsafe knows that doctors are prescribing them to some 25,000 children. Medsafe cannot keep its head in the sand and pretend this isn&#39;t happening.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley said it was extremely concerning that so many young people were being prescribed anti-depressants, rather than given counselling.</p>
<p>&quot;Counselling is far more effective than swallowing pills in treating young people with depression,&quot; said Ms Kedgley. &quot;However, the lack of adolescent counselling services offering alternatives such as cognitive behaviour therapy is creating a situation in which GPs find themselves in a very difficult position.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister should ensure that there are services available to GPs to refer adolescents, rather than having to resort to these potentially dangerous drugs.&quot;  </p>
