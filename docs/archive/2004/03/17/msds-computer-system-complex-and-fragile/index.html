<p>Ministry Of Social Development<br>Computer System &quot;Complex And Fragile&quot;</p>
<p>New Zealand First wants the Government to explain why “departmental politics, a dysfunctional management structure and a horrifying potential cost” are behind the Ministry of Social Development’s inability to sort out its computer systems.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters claimed in Parliament today that the MSD computer system had become so old, complex and fragile that there was a risk it would fail to deliver $12 billion in payments to hundreds thousands of beneficiaries and superannuitants.</p>
<p>“The MSD’s computer system, Swiftt, is a disaster waiting to happen and there has already been a close call in the past month.</p>
<p>“The computer system appears to have grown to a level of complexity that no one person understands exactly what it does and it is just limping along.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters said that the cost of replacing the system could now be in the vicinity of half a billion dollars and that it appeared to be a far worse problem than the failed police INCIS project.</p>
<p>“The most serious issue is that the ministry has still not made a decision about a replacement system and as it will take three to six years to implement whatever is decided, there is a huge potential for non-payment of all benefits and superannuation payments.</p>
<p>“A consulting group warned the ministry years ago that there was a risk of anarchy if the system failed because of the financial hardship it would cause and the risk to the banking system.</p>
<p>“The country needs to know exactly what is happening with the MSD computer system and when the Government will do something to allow public confidence in it, said Mr Peters.</p>
