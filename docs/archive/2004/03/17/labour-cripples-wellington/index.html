<p>Labour Cripples Wellington</p>
<p>United Future&#39;s Gordon Copeland shouldn&#39;t hold his breath for another Mt Victoria tunnel - Labour&#39;s abandoning of the second Terrace tunnel shows it never cared about Wellington&#39;s traffic congestion, ACT New Zealand Wellington-based MP Heather Roy said today.</p>
<p>&quot;During the third Labour Government, the Wellington City bypass was stopped mid-project after then Deputy Prime Minister Hugh Watts&#39; officials produced a document disputing the need for a second Terrace tunnel,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;The funds to complete the development were diverted to build Auckland&#39;s Spaghetti Junction - leaving Wellington&#39;s multi-million dollar motorway to end at a set of traffic lights on one of the city&#39;s narrowest streets.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Watts - an Aucklander - and his officials claimed this would adequately cater to Wellington&#39;s citizens for the foreseeable future. Wellington motorists would disagree.</p>
<p>&quot;The sad fact of the matter is, however, that Labour did not care then, and it does not care now. The third Labour Government stopped the bypass, and the fifth is ensuring Wellington never gets it. The result: a crippled capital city</p>
<p>&quot;In calling simply for a second tunnel through Mt Victoria, Mr Copeland is only worried about traffic congestion that affects him personally. SH1 through Wellington city is a problem that, many contend, is worse than the problems Auckland has experienced with its motorways.</p>
<p>&quot;We should return to the original plan, that was halted in its tracks by Mr Watts. It is an absolute disgrace that the main route through our capital city is brought to a standstill at peak times,&quot; Mrs Roy said.  </p>
