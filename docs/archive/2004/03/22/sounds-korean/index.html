<p>Sounds Korean</p>
<p>Korean music is to take centre stage in Sounds Korean: A Festival of Korean Music next month.</p>
<p>The festival, which runs from April 1 to April 4, has been organised by the Conservatorium of Music at Massey University, Wellington, and Victoria University&#39;s School of Music as part of the initiative to establish the New Zealand School of Music. The festival has been organised in association with the Asia 2000 Foundation and the Embassy of the Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>Festival director Jack Body says “this is a reciprocal event which came about after an initiative by Korean composers to have a concert of New Zealand music in Seoul early last year. It is significant for artists within the region to share their experiences and reach a greater understanding of their respective cultures, rather than always being focused on Europe or America.” A delegation of nine Korean musicians will come to Wellington for this event, as well as composers from as far a field as Japan and Israel.</p>
<p>On Thursday 1 April at the Concert Hall of the Conservatorium of Music, Massey University at 12pm, Wellington ensemble, GateSeven, join forces with guest musicians from Korea to perform traditional and contemporary Korean Music. This free event will feature Postcards from the Camp, by Cecilia Heejeong Kim, a socio-political work for amplified string quartet and video about the Korean ‘comfort women’, women who were used as sex slaves by the Japanese during the Second World War. Two works for the Korean gayageum zither, will be performed by Korean virtuoso Yi Ji-Young.</p>

<p>On Saturday 3 April at 2pm, Murphy Building, Room 632, Victoria University, there will be an open seminar in which New Zealand and Korean composers will share experiences of what it’s like working in their respective countries. Special guest composers from Taiwan, Japan, Australia and Israel will also contribute to the event.</p>
<p>On Sunday 4 April at 2.30pm in the Hunter Council Chamber, Hunter Building, Victoria University, members of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, with Yi Ji-Young (gayageum) and Kim Woong-sik (percussion), under conductor Hamish McKeich will perform, among other works, Dylan Lardelli’s piece Paulownia which has been especially written for the occasion. This innovative cross-cultural piece combines gayageum with an ensemble of Western instruments. The concert begins with a demonstration of traditional Korean instruments, the gayageum zither and changgo drum.</p>
