<p>Education Minister ducks for cover</p>
<p>Trevor Mallard’s attempts to deflect criticism of his school closure programme by criticising an alleged National policy are misleading in the extreme, says National’s Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>Trevor Mallard was thrown out of Parliament today during questions on his back-down on school closures.</p>
<p>“Mr Mallard has promised to waste thousands of dollar of taxpayers money informing schools about a National Party policy that doesn’t exist,” said Mr English.</p>
<p>Last week the Minister said he would inform all schools that National would close 600 schools.</p>
<p>“At a time when he threatens to close 71 schools, it is unwise for him to waste taxpayers money trying to score partisan points.</p>
<p>“600 closures would be clearly ridiculous and unacceptable to both parents and myself.</p>
<p>“As a result of these calculations done by the Minister I am more convinced than ever that changes to schools should be driven by educational quality and local choices, not by formulaic numbers.</p>
<p>“There are a larger number of on-teacher schools than I realised, and a much larger number with 30% empty space. Clearly those parameters need to be put aside or changed before we settle policy.</p>
<p>“The fact that there are hundreds of schools 30% empty makes it seem so unfair that a small selection of schools with spare space have been targeted for closure.</p>
<p>“For months I have been urging the Minister to listen to communities. The key to any National policy with regard to school closures would be the elements of parental and community input.</p>
<p>“Only the recent public dressing-down by the Prime Minister has made the importance of community choice clear to the Minister of Education,” said Mr English.</p>
