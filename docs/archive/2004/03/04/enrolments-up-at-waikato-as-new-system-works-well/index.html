<p>Enrolments Up At Waikato As New System Works Well</p>
<p>Overall enrolments at Waikato University are 988 or 11% better than the same time last year, according to interim figures. Domestic student enrolments are 245 or 3% more, while international enrolments are 743 or 47% ahead.</p>
<p>The figures for 1 March 2004 compared with 3 March 2003 reflect a much more efficient enrolment system that has processed student study applications far faster.</p>
<p>The latest statistics also reflect the early confirmed retention of a large group of international students who started studies in B semester last year, as well as international students from the Language Institute and Foundation Studies moving into degree programmes.</p>
<p>“An extremely pleasing feature of our enrolments this year has been the efficiency of our new SAS-e enrolment system using a Jade platform,” says Dr Wendy Craig, director of student and academic services. “Combined with a great effort from enrolment staff, it means we’ve been able to offer students a much more user-friendly application processing service. &gt;From a systems perspective, this enrolment period has been the most efficient ever.</p>
<p>“Nearly 700 students were enrolled each day last week, completing a variety of processes including selecting papers, getting enrolment agreements, paying fees and getting their student ID cards.</p>
<p>“While many students enrolled by mail and our website, those who did come to enrol in person, both new and returning students, commented on the easy, friendly process.”</p>

<p>Wendy Craig says another very pleasing aspect of the figures to date has been the extra number of A&amp;B Bursary students enrolling at Waikato this year. Already there is a 10% increase in the number of students who attained an A or B Bursary in 2003.</p>
<p>“All eligible students will receive one of the Mercury Energy – Waikato University 40th Anniversary Scholarships worth $3000 for an A bursary and $2000 for a B Bursary. It’s good to know our one-off initiative to celebrate our anniversary will benefit a wide number of students this year,” says Wendy Craig.  </p>
