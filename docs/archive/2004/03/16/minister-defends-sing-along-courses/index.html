<p><strong>Tuesday, 16 March 2004, 8:27 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Minister defends sing-along courses</p>
<p>National&#39;s education spokesman Bill English says he is shocked that Steve Maharey is defending Maori sing-along-to-the-radio courses, costing the taxpayer $15 million a year.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey has told the media the courses are &#39;worthwhile&#39; and &#39;effective&#39;. By endorsing these dubious schemes the Minister is taking valuable funds away from more needy areas in tertiary education.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey&#39;s defence of these courses is confusing given that last week the Government said they would slash funding and cut student numbers, after finding that $115 million is being paid for community education of &#39;debateable quality&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>The Eastern Institute of Technology enrolled some 8000 people in its&#39; free He Waiata Ma te Whanau course last year at a cost of $4 million and is intending to run the course again in July this year.</p>
<p>The course, advertised at <a href="http://www.eit.ac.nz/index.php?p=134">http://www.eit.ac.nz/index.php?p=134</a> offers participants the chance to &#39;Relax in the comfort of your own home&#39; and &#39;just sing-along.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;EIT is one of a number of institutions receiving funding for running community education programmes of dubious quality, leading to a $115 million dollar blow-out in spending this year.</p>
<p>&quot;This has occurred despite the birth last year of Steve Maharey&#39;s much talked-about &#39;steering&#39; mechanism for the tertiary education sector, the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC).</p>
<p>&quot;Is this the new standard of accountability and strategic direction we can expect from the TEC?</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister&#39;s support for this scandalous spending of taxpayer funds shows the Government tertiary reforms are well off-track,&quot; said Mr English.  </p>
