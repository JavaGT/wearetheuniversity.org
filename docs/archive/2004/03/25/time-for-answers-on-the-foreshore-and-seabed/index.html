<p><strong>Thursday, 25 March 2004, 8:22 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Time for answers on the foreshore and seabed</p>
<p>The time has come for Margaret Wilson to tell New Zealand what the Government has in store for the foreshore and seabed, says Dr Wayne Mapp, National&#39;s Spokesman for Treaty of Waitangi and Constitutional Issues.</p>
<p>&quot;Under pressure in the House to provide the nation with answers, all the Minister can say is &#39;wait for the legislation&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders have waited and lived with this uncertainty for long enough,&quot; says Dr Mapp. &quot;I challenge Margaret Wilson to come clean and answer the following questions:</p>
<p>* Will there be a dual title of Crown title and customary title?</p>
<p>* Will Maori have co-management of all of the foreshore and seabed?</p>
<p>* Will the High Court have jurisdiction to deal with customary title and customary rights?</p>
<p>• When will the legislation be introduced?</p>
<p>&quot;These are all simple questions that the Government has more than ample time to consider. &quot;They have made countless u-turns on this issue. Having considered every possible option at least once they must surely have developed a policy.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government owes it to New Zealanders to come clean on an issue that stands to affect the livelihood and lifestyle of thousands of people across the country,&quot; says Dr Mapp.</p>
<p>&quot;If the legislation is due soon, and it must be, then the Government already knows the answers. Why won&#39;t they tell New Zealand?&quot;  </p>
