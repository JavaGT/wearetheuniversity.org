<p>Online evolution</p>
<p>An A-to-Z of the sometimes controversial subject of evolution is being made available from today on a new Waikato University website.</p>
<p>The site is aimed primarily at providing expert support and quality material for New Zealand&#39;s science teachers.</p>
<p>The Evolution for Teaching website is on: <a href="http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/evolution/index.shtml">http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/evolution/index.shtml</a></p>
<p>The website has been developed over eight months by a group of staff from the School of Science and Technology.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ve created the site in response to issues raised with us by teachers and as a result of our own research into the gaps in the sites that were already available,&quot; says the team&#39;s leader, biological sciences lecturer Alison Campbell.</p>
<p>&quot;The new site stands apart from existing material available on the web in that it specifically focuses on evolution and related geological concepts from a New Zealand perspective, with New Zealand examples and links to the New Zealand senior school curriculum. It&#39;s already received very favourable comment from teachers, university staff and bodies such as NZ Skeptics.&quot;</p>
<p>The content will be reviewed annually so that the site remains accurate and relevant.</p>
<p>On Friday 26 March from 5.30pm-8.30pm, the department of biological sciences will host a launch of the website at the university for interested biology and science teachers.  </p>
