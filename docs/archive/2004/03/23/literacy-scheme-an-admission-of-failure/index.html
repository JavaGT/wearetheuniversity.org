<p><strong>Tuesday, 23 March 2004, 3:47 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Bill English MP National Spokesman</p>
<p>23 March 2004</p>
<p>Literacy scheme an admission of failure</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s extension of a professional literacy programme for schools is a belated admission of failure, says National&#39;s Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;Far too many children are leaving primary school without basic literacy knowledge.</p>
<p>&quot;National brought in nationwide testing of nine-year olds to measure literacy and combat underachievement. Labour scrapped that scheme at the insistence of the teacher&#39;s unions. Adding a limited number of schools to a new teaching programme does not make up for that.</p>
<p>&quot;Teaching literacy should be the fundamental job of every primary school. Professional literacy support should be available to every school that needs it, not just those on a special project.</p>
<p>&quot;Every child should leave school knowing how to read and write, no matter where they live or what their parents income is.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s announcement will benefit some secondary school students whose literacy is not up to scratch, but for too many New Zealand children, it&#39;s too little, too late,&quot; said Mr English.</p>
