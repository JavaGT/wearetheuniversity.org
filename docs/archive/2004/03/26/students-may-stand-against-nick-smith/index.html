<p><strong>Friday, 26 March 2004, 12:41 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Andrew Kirton NZUSA Co-President</p>
<p>Students may stand against Nick Smith and for a living allowance for all students</p>
<p>Co-President of the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA), Andrew Kirton is considering standing as an independent against National Party MP Nick Smith and for a living allowance for all students should a by-election in Nelson be held.</p>
<p>&quot;Student debt is well over $6 billion thanks to National and Labour governments who introduced one of the harshest student loan schemes in the world, it is about time these parties started addressing the causes of student debt and introduced a living allowance for all students,&quot; said Andrew Kirton, NZUSA Co-President.</p>
<p>&quot;If none of the other parties are going to front up against Nick Smith and raise important issues like student debt with the Nelson electorate then I will,&quot; said Kirton.</p>
<p>&quot;Students in the Nelson electorate and around New Zealand are the only group in society who must borrow to meet their cost of living,&quot; said Kirton. &quot;This is as a direct result of government policy and it is about time a whole generation of our best and brightest were given a fair go,&quot; said Kirton</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps if the National Party and the Government are faced with a student leader as a candidate they will start to take student debt seriously and introduce a living allowance for all students.&quot;</p>
<p>Kirton said he was not sure of his chances, but given that 80 percent of New Zealanders support a living allowance for all students he thinks he would have a good shot.</p>
