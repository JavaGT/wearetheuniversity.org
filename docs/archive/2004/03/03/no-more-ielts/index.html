<p>No more IELTS</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury is offering international students a non-IELTS pathway to tertiary study.</p>
<p>The University has introduced two new English language preparatory courses which focus on a range of skills needed to succeed at tertiary study rather than on passing the IELTS (International English Language Testing System) exam.</p>
<p>The English Language Centre’s Programme Manager Mr Paul Coleman said students were passing the IELTS exams but didn’t necessarily have the study skills to go on to achieve at degree level.</p>
<p>“Rather than spending the time preparing for a one-off IELTS exam, students can now focus on English language proficiency and the study skills which will help them succeed in their degree study,” said Mr Coleman.</p>
<p>“The new English language courses are about giving the students the best possible preparation for successful degree study. The focus is not on getting into university but on doing well and graduating with a degree.”</p>
<p>Students have the choice of two non-IELTS pathways. The English for Academic Purposes for Foundation Studies is a 12 week course which prepares students for the University’s non-IELTS Foundation Studies Programme. The Certificate of English for Tertiary Studies is a 28 week course which prepares students for undergraduate and postgraduate degree study. Both courses are based on continuous assessment.</p>
<p>This now means that students who pass either the Certificate of English for Tertiary Studies or the English for Academic Purposes for Foundation Studies and the Foundation Studies Certificate will not have to take the IELTS examination for entry to most degree programmes in all New Zealand Universities.</p>
<p>“The Certificate qualifications are approved by the New Zealand Universities Vice Chancellors&#39; Committee,” said Mr Coleman.</p>
<p>The University will still offer an English for Academic Purposes IELTS Course for students who prefer this option.</p>
