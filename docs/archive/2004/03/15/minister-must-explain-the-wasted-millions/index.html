<p><strong>Monday, 15 March 2004, 8:30 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Minister must explain the wasted millions</p>
<p>&quot;Fee paying students must call on Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey to explain how he spent $15 million last year on radio sing-a-long studies,&quot; says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>&quot;Its time for some accountability over the waste of millions of dollars of much needed tertiary education funding.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year Tairawhiti Polytechnic in Gisborne was paid $11 million of tertiary education money for handing out a waiata songbook to enrolled students who were asked to sing along with the songs on the radio.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no qualification at the end of the course, which consists of five half hour lessons, broadcast each week, for eight weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Tairawhiti Polytechnic must have enrolled between eight and ten thousand people in Gisborne for this programme to have achieved over 2000 EFTS and $11 million in Government funding.</p>
<p>&quot;Eastern Institute of Technology in Hawke&#39;s Bay earned $4 million on the same programme &#39;He Waiata Ma Te Whanau&#39; (songs for the whole family).</p>
<p>&quot;There is no way of knowing whether the students did the course and nothing for them at the end of it,&quot; notes Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no objection to people learning songs for cultural reasons, but for the taxpayer to be contributing $15 million towards it is ridiculous,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve Maharey has been talking about steering the tertiary system for the last five years. He has produced documents, strategies legislation and a new multi-million dollar Tertiary Education Commission. Now it&#39;s time for some accountability,&quot; says Mr English.  </p>
