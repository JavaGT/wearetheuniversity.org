<p>Excellent Trio Receive Medals</p>
<p>Three Waikato University staff have received Vice-Chancellor&#39;s medals for excellence in teaching in 2003, the first year that many people have received the award since it was instituted in 1998.</p>
<p>Senior psychology lecturer Thomas Kalliath, management communications senior lecturer Debashish Munshi and law Professor Peter Spiller will be awarded their medals at a ceremony in the university&#39;s WEL Energy Trust Academy of Performing Arts on Monday 22 March.</p>
<p>The awards are designed to recognize the importance Waikato University places on quality teaching and the significant contribution to learning made by teachers with a focus on excellence.</p>
<p>Human resources development advisor Mike Bell says each of the 2003 winners &quot;displayed excellence in their teaching with a good philosophical basis and constant self-evaluation to improve their skills and knowledge&quot;.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould said of the recipients: &quot;I think they are all extremely meritorious in differing ways.&quot;  </p>
