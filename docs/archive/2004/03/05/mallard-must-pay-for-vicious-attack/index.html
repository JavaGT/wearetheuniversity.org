<p>Mallard Must Pay For Vicious Attack</p>
<p>Friday 5 Mar 2004 Rodney Hide Press Releases -- Education</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Finance Spokesman Rodney Hide today urged Prime Minister Helen Clark to remove Education Minister Trevor Mallard from the Education portfolio.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard&#39;s attack on Hagley Community College was unprecedented in its ferocity and totally unwarranted. I have today visited the school, inspected the prayer room, met the Principal and Deputy Principal, and spoken to students,&quot; Mr Hide said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hagley Community College is a great school. We should be proud of this school and should be celebrating its success.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead we have had the Minister attack the school in a sneaky and vicious way. Mr Mallard has never visited the school, and clearly does not appreciate its achievements. He has only condemned the school because he is in reverse gear following Don Brash&#39;s speech.</p>
<p>&quot;This school has done everything right - it&#39;s the Minister who has it so wrong. I don&#39;t see how any parent or school could have any confidence in a Minister who would attack a successful, thriving school so viciously and so falsely.</p>
<p>&quot;The Prime Minister knows that Hagley Community College is a great school, and should recognise that Mr Mallard has completely ruined his reputation as Education Minister. She should move him sideways to another portfolio, and appoint someone fresh who will respect our schools and our school boards. Mr Mallard has to go,&quot; Mr Hide said.</p>
