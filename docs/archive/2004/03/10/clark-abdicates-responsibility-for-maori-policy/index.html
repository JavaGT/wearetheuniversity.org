<p><strong>Wednesday, 10 March 2004, 12:10 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Helen Clark abdicates responsibility for Maori policy</p>
<p>National Party Leader Don Brash says the next National Government would have to reconsider the terms of any inquiry launched by Labour into the state of New Zealand&#39;s race relations.</p>
<p>&quot;From the way the Prime Minister is talking now, it seems inevitable she will try to bury this issue with an inquiry until after the next election.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s nothing but a stalling tactic from a desperate Government that&#39;s doing all it can to get the issue off the agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark appears to be making up policy on the hoof now, suggesting that she would consider consulting the Opposition over the terms of reference for any such inquiry.</p>
<p>&quot;After reflecting on that offer, I can only conclude that Helen Clark is cynically prepared to allow a royal commission to set her policy. National has a policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark should tell the public what she really thinks and let them decide - in a democracy that is called a general election.</p>
<p>&quot;The people must be allowed to determine the future of race relations in New Zealand, not a few academics who have been hand picked by an ideologically driven Labour Government.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour promised hundreds of inquiries while in Opposition and have launched scores more while in Government.</p>
<p>&quot;Governments are elected to govern. Helen Clark should reflect on that,&quot; says Dr Brash.  </p>
