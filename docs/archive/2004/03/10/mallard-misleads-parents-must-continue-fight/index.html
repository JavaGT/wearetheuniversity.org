<p>Mallard Misleads With Promises Of Mediation And Moratorium - Parents Must Continue Fight</p>
<p>Wednesday 10 Mar 2004 Deborah Coddington Press Releases -- Education -- Save Our Schools</p>
<p>Beleaguered Education Minister Trevor Mallard is misleading schools with his poll-driven U-turn on school closures, ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The moratorium is a Clayton&#39;s moratorium. The Minister is reserving the right to review schools if they have unfavourable ERO reports, change their make-up in any way, or &#39;request&#39; a review. Schools are now being pressured into &#39;requesting&#39; a review.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard is still hanging network reviews above schools&#39; heads like the Sword of Damocles,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;NZEI, the primary teachers&#39; union, has finally decided to highlight these matters and oppose the reviews - not, however, to protect children&#39;s education, but because the NZEI is losing members.</p>
<p>&quot;Also, parents of schools where mediation is offered have contacted me worried about what this mediation actually means.</p>
<p>&quot;I share their concerns - mediation appears to be facilitation in disguise. Facilitation got schools nowhere, in terms of decision-making and consultation. There&#39;s nothing to indicate that mediation will be any different.</p>
<p>&quot;Is the Minister just being cute? Offering mediation as a way to cover the Crown&#39;s back and put a halt to any prospective legal action, as threatened by Invercargill Mayor Tim Shadbolt.</p>

<p>&quot;I asked constitutional law expert Mai Chen this very question. She said parents should go into mediation &#39;without prejudice&#39;. This means if mediation ends up going nowhere, schools have not relinquished their legal rights.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard is not the ultimate power. There is such a thing as natural justice. If some schools have been spared closure and merger, because of the moratorium, then other schools could argue they deserve the same treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;I urge parents and schools to keep fighting.</p>
<p>&quot;I have further evidence that there is no need for these massive reviews. Mr Mallard has repeatedly based them on falling numbers of school students - 60,000 to 70,000 fewer by 2020.</p>
<p>&quot;However, I have Education Ministry figures that record the total number of students and schools since 1970.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1990, the lowest year for students with 650,582 (compared with 761,755 in 2003) we had 2,864 schools - 171 more than in 2003. So in 1990, there were on average 227 pupils per school, and in 2003 there were 282 pupils per school.</p>
<p>&quot;If it wasn&#39;t a problem in 1990, with the lowest ratio, why is it a problem now?</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m urging parents not to give up. Accept mediation, but make it clear you are not giving up your legal rights to challenge the Government&#39;s decision,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
