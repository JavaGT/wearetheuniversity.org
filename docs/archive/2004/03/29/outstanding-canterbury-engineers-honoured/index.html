<p>Outstanding Canterbury Engineers Honoured</p>
<p>Canterbury University’s Dean of Engineering and Forestry, Associate Professor Alexander Sutherland, has been recognised as being at the top of his profession.</p>
<p>The Institute of Professional Engineers (IPENZ), which represents all engineering disciplines, has made him one of its distinguished fellows for what it describes as an outstanding career.</p>
<p>IPENZ deputy chief executive, John Gardiner, says no more than half a dozen people are made distinguished fellows each year, their work having to be over and above the norm.</p>
<p>“It’s not just for doing a good job. Alex has made a major contribution to New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The strength, quality and stability of the School of Engineering at Canterbury is largely attributable to him,” Mr Gardiner says.</p>
<p>Professor Sutherland was Dean of Engineering from 1987. This year he was made the Dean of Engineering and Forestry after a restructuring of academic departments.</p>
<p>Two other Canterbury University staff and an adjunct professor have also been honoured.</p>
<p>John Mander, a professor of structural engineering, and John Lumsden, projects director at the university’s Centre for Advanced Engineering, have been made fellows of the institute.</p>
<p>IPENZ chief executive, Andrew Cleland, says receiving a fellowship carries substantial prestige.</p>
<p>“It is not a reward for long service or for advancement in seniority with one’s employer, rather it is recognition by IPENZ of the contribution of outstanding individuals.”</p>
<p>Des Bull, who is the Holcim Adjunct Professor of Concrete Design at Canterbury, has won an IPENZ Professional Commitment Award for his ongoing contribution to the engineering profession.</p>
<p>As well as acknowledging the work of academic staff, IPENZ recognises the achievements of engineering students.</p>
<p>Canterbury University’s John Stowers was a finalist in this year’s Student Design Award, for his “Cricket Scorer” project.</p>
<p>The electronic device simplifies the process of scoring a cricket game and provides statistical and analytical information which can be used during and after a cricket match.</p>
