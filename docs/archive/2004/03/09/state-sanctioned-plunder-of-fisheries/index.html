<p><strong>Tuesday, 9 March 2004, 3:19 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>State sanctioned plunder of fisheries</p>
<p>National Party Fisheries spokesman Phil Heatley is condemning the Government for its failure to police customary fishing regulations.</p>
<p>He&#39;s commenting in the wake of threats against Fisheries Officers by some members of the Potaka Marae on the East Cape, where an illegal marine farm has been established.</p>
<p>&quot;This must not be allowed to continue. The new Fisheries Minister must show some leadership. He must act in the national interest and protect our fisheries resource.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s hard not to come to the conclusion that Labour&#39;s passively accepting double standards when it comes to the policing of fisheries regulations,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Earlier this week Mr Heatley released answers to parliamentary questions which showed that 1369 infringement notices were handed out to recreational fishers in the 2002/03 fishing year, 807 were handed out to commercial interests and none to customary fishers.</p>
<p>In the previous year only two notices were issued to customary fishers.</p>
<p>&quot;When thousands of customary permits are issued every year, it&#39;s simply astounding the Fisheries Ministry has ignored this issue for so long.</p>
<p>&quot;On the face of it, the Ministry appears to be paying no attention to customary fishers who break the law,&quot; says Mr Heatley.</p>
<p>&quot;We also know from Parliamentary questions that the Ministry is not keeping adequate records. That&#39;s particularly concerning when the Government&#39;s considering a plan that would provide for a whole new set of customary rights.</p>
<p>&quot;It should not matter who is responsible for plundering our fish stocks, they should be treated equally before the law.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s this kind of politically correct nonsense that fuels the resentment and suspicion among non-Maori,&quot; says Mr Heatley.</p>
<p>So far this year 580 recreational, 264 commercial and five customary infringement notices have been issued.</p>
