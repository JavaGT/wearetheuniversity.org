<p>Labour&#39;s immigration policy in chaos</p>
<p>The Labour Government&#39;s new immigration policy is in chaos and is preventing many highly skilled, desirable migrants from settling in New Zealand, says Dr Wayne Mapp, National&#39;s Immigration Spokesman.</p>
<p>&quot;The NZIS Skilled Migrant Category Decision Paper, released last week, reveals that just 479 skilled migrant applicants will be accepted into New Zealand in the four months to July this year. That&#39;s out of a maximum quota of 28,000 skilled migrants for the 2003/4 financial year. Almost the entire quota was filled in the first six months of the year</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s mismanagement of the skilled migrant quota threatens to destroy New Zealand&#39;s image overseas. Immigrants simply cannot trust this Government and it&#39;s handling of immigration policy.</p>
<p>Dr Mapp also says &quot;the current requirement of 185 points is unobtainable for all but a handful of potential migrants.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, a 25-year-old with a New Zealand university degree and a job offer would not qualify for permanent residence under the current system,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;Such highly desirable immigrants are being turned away because of the extreme swings of Labour&#39;s immigration policy.</p>
<p>&quot;One minute the bar is set too low and the country struggles to deal with large numbers of immigrants, and the next minute the Government is making knee-jerk changes that have all but closed the door on migrants&quot;, says Dr Mapp.</p>
<p>&quot;Good immigration policy requires continuity and certainty for the benefit of both New Zealand and for immigrants looking to make considerable life changes.</p>
<p>&quot;The disgraceful state of our immigration policy is harming our ability to attract high quality migrants, something our economic future depends on&quot;.</p>
