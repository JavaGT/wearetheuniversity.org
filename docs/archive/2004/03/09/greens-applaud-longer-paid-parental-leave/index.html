<p>Greens applaud longer paid parental leave</p>
<p>The Green Party has congratulated the Government on extending paid parental leave to 14 weeks and hopes it will now move quickly to provide paid parental leave for self-employed women.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s move brings New Zealand into step with International Labour Organisation guidelines,&quot; said Sue Kedgley, the Green Party Women&#39;s Affairs spokesperson. &quot;However, with many women moving into self employment as a means to balancing work and parental responsibilities, we hope the Government will move swiftly to extend the scheme to them.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley noted that the Government&#39;s Action Plan for Women, released on International Women&#39;s Day, contained many good initiatives but fell short on the details of implementation. &quot;At the end of the day, it stands or falls on the willingness of the Government to put money into the initiatives or to pass legislation to remove discrimination.</p>
<p>&quot;As one example, more money is required in the health system to give nurses fair pay,&quot; said Ms Kedgley. &quot;Will the Government commit to that?&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley applauded the Government&#39;s commitment to the principle of work-life balance and called on it to support her Flexible Working Hours private member&#39;s bill, which would help women with young children achieve work-life balance.</p>
<p>She noted that the plan highlighted the discriminatory nature of the student loan scheme, but was disappointed that no concrete action was proposed to address the problem.  </p>
