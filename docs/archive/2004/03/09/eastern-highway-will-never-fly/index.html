<p>Eastern Highway will never fly</p>
<p>Auckland Green MP Keith Locke described today&#39;s Eastern Transport Corridor announcement as a debacle for proponents of the plan.</p>
<p>The preferred option, presented today by consultants Opus to Mayors John Banks and Sir Barry Curtis, would see up to 1500 homes demolished to make way for more roading.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than advancing the project, today&#39;s recommendations put another nail in its coffin,&quot; said Mr Locke, the Green Party&#39;s associate Transport spokesperson.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no way the public will allow between $2.8 billion and $3.9 billion to be spent on a highway that is going to destroy homes and green space, and pour thousands more cars into central Auckland.</p>
<p>&quot;The Auckland and Manukau mayors can&#39;t justify today&#39;s recommendation by arguing it is better than the other options, put up to divert attention from the main game. Promoting the proposal as multi-modal won&#39;t fool many people. Everyone knows the two mayors are promoting a highway.</p>
<p>&quot;Luckily for Auckland, their project is doomed to failure. There&#39;s no way the Eastern Highway would meet the economic, environmental, health and mobility criteria in the new Land Management Transport Act,&quot; said Mr Locke.</p>
<p>&quot;The best option is still to improve and extend the corridor&#39;s rail system and get more people travelling by train.&quot;  </p>
