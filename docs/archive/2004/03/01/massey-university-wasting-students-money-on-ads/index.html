<p>Massey University wasting students’ money on advertising</p>
<p>Massey University is wasting more student and public money than ever on marketing according to figures released today by the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>“Massey wasted over $2 million on advertising and marketing at the same time as they raised student fees for the first time since 1999” said Adam Maynard, President of the Massey University Students’ Association (MUSA).</p>
<p>“There is little evidence to suggest that money spent by Massey on advertising and marketing has effected students decisions on where to study” said Maynard “It represents a complete waste of money and shows how out of touch Massey are with students”.</p>
<p>“The 3.5% fee increase by Massey last year is estimated to bring in an extra three million dollars to the Massey coffers, if the funds directed into advertising had been cut Massey could have saved the money instead of passing the load onto those who can least afford it” said Maynard.</p>
<p>“The government must step in and restrict this spending as universities clearly cannot be trusted to spend student and public money responsibly” said Maynard.  </p>
