<p>Kiwi Gods: Religion and New Zealand</p>
<p>The significance of religion in New Zealand is to be explored in a major series of free public lectures starting this week at Victoria University.</p>
<p>Organised by University&#39;s Stout Research Centre for New Zealand Studies, the lectures explore religion from a variety of angles including sport, Mâori Christianity, sexuality, nationalism, youth and justice.</p>
<p>Stout Research Centre Director Dr Lydia Wevers says religion is an issue that is often not properly discussed in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;There has never been a comprehensive history of religion in New Zealand. The histories that have been written tend to focus on a particular faith or church.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand is often described as a very secular country. Education, for example, which is often a flashpoint for religious controversy in other countries is highly secular in New Zealand. But even so, there is quite a strong religious presence in New Zealand, a presence that is often not openly acknowledged.</p>
<p>&quot;In this lecture series, which we hope to publish as a series of essays, we&#39;ve attempted to look at religion from a variety of different angles. For example, Jo Randerson, a playwright and daughter of an Anglican bishop, delves into the perspective of being young and Christian whilst Ghazala Anwar looks at the view of a Muslim woman practising her faith in Christchurch, the mosque furthest from Mecca.&quot;</p>
<p>The series begins on Wednesday with an overview by Victoria Professor Paul Morris and concludes with a lecture by Victoria Emeritus Professor Lloyd Geering on June 16. The lectures run from 4.10-5.30pm at the Stout Research Centre, 12 Waiteata Rd. The full listing is:</p>
