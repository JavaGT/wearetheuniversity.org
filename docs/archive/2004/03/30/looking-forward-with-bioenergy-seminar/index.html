<p>Elizabeth Yeaman - Bringing biofuel blends to market in New Zealand</p>
<p>Elizabeth Yeaman is Senior Advisor Transport at the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA), where she manages EECA&#39;s Transport Fuels programme. Elizabeth is originally a metallurgist and materials engineer who also holds a Master&#39;s degree in renewable energy natural resource engineering. She has worked for EECA for the last seven years. Prior to this she worked in engineering consultancies in New Zealand principally on transport and household energy projects in developing countries for organisations including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.</p>

<p>Elizabeth will provide an overview of what actions are occurring throughout NZ to bring biofuels to market.</p>
<p>Andrew Smith - Meridian Energy and Biodiesel - The feasibility of tallow based biodiesel production in the South Island</p>
<p>Andrew Smith has a degree in Environmental Science, and a passion for the outdoors. A personal interest in renewable end sustainable energy saw him sign up for a Masters Degree in Applied Science with the Centre for Energy Research at Massey University. The Centre&#39;s entry of two Volkswagen vehicles in the EECA Energywise Rally in 2002 provided a rapid introduction to biodiesel as an alternative fuel, and the Volkswagen Golf fuelled on rapeseed based biodiesel manufactured at the University by Andrew proved a great success. This led to a thesis research topic focusing on biodiesel and the feasibility of its production and use. A Technology Industry Fellowship was successfully obtained for Andrew by Meridian Energy which was considering using biodiesel during the construction phase of Project Aqua. Andrew is due to finish his thesis mid 2004, and has just been appointed to the EECA biofuels team.</p>
<p>Anouk Florentinus - The race around biomass gasification: is New Zealand going to lead or take?</p>
<p>Gasification technology for biomass has developed over the past 30 years in both New Zealand and in the Netherlands. Comparing developments between these two very different countries leads to interesting learning experiences. Both countries have different policy drivers for the technology and different cultures but both have ratified the Kyoto Protocol and are willing to make significant efforts to implement renewable energy projects. The question is whether New Zealand will lead this technology based on continuing R and D investment or take up new knowledge from the Netherlands and the rest of the world?</p>
<p>Anouk is working on her masters degree at Utrecht University, the Netherlands. For the last four years she has studied within a programme called Natural Sciences and Innovation management and is now finishing up with a Master of Science degree. Her major is in renewable energy and materials.</p>
<p>She started her thesis in September last year at Utrecht University where she investigated the development of biomass gasification in the Netherlands. After having spent nearly three months now in New Zealand at the Centre for Energy Research at Massey University, Palmerston North, she is about ready to return to the Netherlands again to write her thesis about the comparison between the Netherlands and New Zealand on this interesting technology. Her paper can be expected around September this year.</p>
