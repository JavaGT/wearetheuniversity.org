<p>Bill English National Education Spokesman</p>

<p>Minister complicit in school&#39;s cover-up job</p>
<p>Education Minister Trevor Mallard has been complicit in attempts by the Correspondence School to conceal information from students, parents and the public, says National&#39;s Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>Allegations the school&#39;s computers were used to download pornographic material were first raised last December, at which time the school employed a public relations firm to manage the problem.</p>
<p>Mr English says Mr Mallard not only approved of the school&#39;s extensive spin strategy, but his office also offered the school advice on how to keep information away from the media.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister turned down Official Information Act requests for information by denying he held information. His officials have today &#39;now located&#39; that information.</p>
<p>&quot;The documents show Mr Mallard was warned by the school that &#39;the number of cases which warrant disciplinary action is high&#39;, and that &#39;there is no way that the issues arising from the original complaint can be considered as anything but extremely serious&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;It is appalling that now, four months later, we are discovering that the allegations go much deeper than the Correspondence School was first prepared to admit,&quot; Mr English says.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only are there 30 cases of computer misuse currently being investigated, but the original investigation also involves physical relationships with two students.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Mallard has refused to release a draft communications initiatives paper.</p>

<p>Draft briefing notes contain a risk assessment that says, &#39;the combination of computers, vulnerable pupils and potentially predatory teachers is a combustible mix&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet the school has been more concerned with protecting Mr Mallard than being open and honest.</p>
<p>&quot;The school&#39;s 20,000 pupils, their parents and the public deserve more than spin and platitudes.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard has had to deal with bad publicity over the school network reviews, NCEA results and the truancy service - he should know by now that honesty is the best policy,&quot; says Mr English.</p>

<p>Background on Correspondence School&#39;s trouble</p>
<p>Recent revelations show that the extent of problems at the Correspondence School is more serious than previously thought.</p>
<p>In January this year it was reported that a teacher had resigned from the school after a complaint about inappropriate material being stored on a computer, prompting an audit of all the school&#39;s computers.</p>
<p>Official Information Act requests and subsequent questioning by the National Party have revealed that:</p>
<p>* The teacher who sparked the initial investigation had a physical relationship with the complainant and physical contact with another student.</p>
<p>* The audit has resulted in a significant number of staff departures by dismissal or resignation.</p>
<p>* Two of those particular individuals are members of the senior management team and three hold senior positions as regional supervisors.</p>
<p>* Up to 30 staff are being investigated as a result of the audit.</p>
<p>* The number of staff are facing disciplinary action is high.</p>
<p>* At least four cases relating to inappropriate computer usage at the school have been referred to the Teacher&#39;s Council.</p>
<p>By the assessment of both E-Crime (the forensic IT specialists in charge of the audit) and the school show the situation is &quot;highly unusual&quot;.</p>
