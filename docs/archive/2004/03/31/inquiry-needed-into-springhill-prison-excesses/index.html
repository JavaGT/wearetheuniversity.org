<p>Dr Paul Hutchison<br>Port Waikato MP</p>

<p>Inquiry needed into Springhill Prison excesses</p>
<p>A huge waste of taxpayer money is one of many reasons for an inquiry into Springhill Prison, says Dr Paul Hutchison National MP for Port Waikato.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Corrections Minister Paul Swain refused to ask the Auditor-General for an independent inquiry into the new 650-bed prison at Meremere as controversy around exclusive consultation and burgeoning prices continues.</p>
<p>Dr Hutchison says the excessive $1.3 million spent to get iwi approval for the new prison shows just how determined the Government has been in using every resource to ram the project through.</p>
<p>&quot;The $1.3 million is an affront to the local community which, by comparison, was virtually sidelined from the consultation process over the new prison site.</p>
<p>&quot;The North Huntly Community Board wrote to the Corrections Minister suggesting a more suitable site than Meremere. Rather than being properly analysed, their suggestion was ignored.</p>
<p>&quot;To rub salt into their wounds, the cost of Springhill Prison has escalated from $188 million to $250 million. &quot;Even after serious accusations of &#39;manipulations of the resource consent process and... blatant corruption for pecuniary gain&#39;, the Corrections Department is failing to take accountability for the budget blowout.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not satisfactory.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government remains determined to bulldoze through approval for the prison regardless of public concerns and by paying excessive amounts to secure the support of local Maori,&quot; says Dr Hutchison.</p>
