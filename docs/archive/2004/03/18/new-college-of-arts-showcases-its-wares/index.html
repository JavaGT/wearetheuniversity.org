<p>Dignitaries from the city and the business, cultural and education sectors will join with university staff on Friday to celebrate the formal opening of the new College of Arts.</p>
<p>The Arts College, one of four Colleges in a new structure adopted by the University this year, is the first to welcome the wider community to its new home.</p>
<p>College Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor Kenneth Strongman said the occasion provided a chance for the community to meet key staff and see the new offices.</p>
<p>“It’s also an opportunity for us to showcase some of the very diverse things we do in the Arts and Social Sciences. There’ll be a kapa haka performance from our Maori Department, a jazz ensemble from the School of Music, art works on show from staff and students in the School of Fine Arts and a display of all the courses and programmes offered in the College,” he said.</p>
<p>The opening starts at 2pm on Friday in the Arts quadrangle with a powhiri conducted by the University Chaplain, Reverend Turi Hollis, and short speeches by the Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Sharp and College’s PVC, Professor Kenneth Strongman.</p>
