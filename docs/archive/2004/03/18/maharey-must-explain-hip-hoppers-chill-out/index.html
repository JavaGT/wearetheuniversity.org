<p>Katherine Rich MP</p>
<p>National Party Social Services Spokeswoman</p>
<p>18 March 2004</p>
<p>Maharey must explain hip-hoppers &#39;chill out&#39;</p>
<p>National Party Social Services spokeswoman Katherine Rich is calling on the Government to explain why hip-hoppers travelling on taxpayer funding &#39;went to Hawaii and Fiji ... basically to chill out&#39;, and she is calling on the Minister to review the entire project.</p>
<p>Mrs Rich is responding to revelations today that the mother and daughter who went on a $26,000 taxpayer-funded &#39;hip-hop investigative tour&#39; spent time in Hawaii and Fiji, even though they say &#39;there is no hip-hop culture to the same extent as what we saw in New York and LA&#39;. &quot;By their own admission &#39;nothing major came of the trip, apart from seeing it all happen&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;That seems like the predictable outcome when the project purpose, according to Labour Department papers, was for &#39;two people to do a whole lot of travelling for hip-hop&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;All taxpaying New Zealanders will be outraged by this scandalous use of their money.</p>
<p>&quot;This woman admits she was not an academic, and knew nothing about hip-hop, so she wasn&#39;t really the ideal person to send around the world researching it.</p>
<p>&quot;Exploring new interests and visiting family is fine, but most New Zealanders don&#39;t do that with taxpayers&#39; money.</p>
<p>&quot;Many New Zealanders would give their eye teeth to &#39;chill out&#39; in Hawaii and Fiji, but they don&#39;t expect the taxpayer to fund it.</p>
<p>&quot;We currently have 6000 New Zealand children waiting to see a social worker, and I think there are greater youth priorities than sending someone halfway across the world to study hip-hop,&quot; says Mrs Rich.</p>
