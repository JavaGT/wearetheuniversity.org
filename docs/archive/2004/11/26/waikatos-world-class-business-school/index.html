<p>Waikato’s world-class business school status confirmed</p>
<p>Waikato Management School’s world-class status has been confirmed with accreditation from EQUIS, the European Quality Improvement System, an international hallmark of business school excellence.</p>
<p>Dean, Professor Mike Pratt, said the School was delighted to receive the acknowledgement.</p>
<p>“Building on our PBRF success, this is a big step towards our challenge of being recognised as one of the world’s leading schools committed to sustainability. The accreditation process involves many months of rigorous self-examination and review but the result makes the effort very worthwhile.”</p>
<p>EQUIS is one of the European Foundation for Management Development’s quality standards. It signals to students and faculty worldwide that a business school is of the highest calibre.</p>
<p>Professor Pratt said New Zealand business schools were operating in an international market and recognition by a European organisation was important in this respect.</p>
<p>Accreditation would help in recruiting well-qualified staff and leading researchers as well as provide a quality assurance to students. EQUIS accreditation was sought after and had been awarded to less than 80 business schools around the world.</p>
<p>To qualify for EQUIS accreditation, business schools must meet international criteria for size, quality and scope of courses. They must then submit a detailed evaluation review against rigorous standards. An overseas panel of academics and business people visits the school to interview staff, students and stakeholders. The panel examines qualifications, curriculum delivery, research, contribution to business and the school’s international focus. A review report is submitted to the EQUIS awarding body which judges the school’s performance against international standards for excellence.</p>

<p>Earlier this year Waikato Management School topped the national PBRF rankings – an evaluation of tertiary sector research – in the two largest business categories – Accounting and Finance, and Management, Human Resources, Industrial Relations, International Business and Other Business.</p>
<p>“Adding EQUIS accreditation to that result gives us national and international recognition that our teaching and research is rigorous, relevant and globally applicable,” Professor Pratt said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Waikato Management School’s MBA degree was internationally recognised with accreditation to the London-based Association of MBAs (AMBA).</p>
