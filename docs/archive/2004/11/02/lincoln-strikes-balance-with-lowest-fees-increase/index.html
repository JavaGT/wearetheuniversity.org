<p>Lincoln University strikes balance with lowest fees increase</p>
<p>Lincoln University’s 3 percent average increase in domestic fees for 2005 strikes a balance between student concerns at the cost of their tertiary education and institutional concerns at the cost of providing that education in an environment of shrinking Government funding, says Chancellor Margaret Austin.</p>
<p>Lincoln University Council approved new domestic fee levels for the year ahead at its meeting today (2 Nov.) at an average of 3 percent over all subjects. The increase is nearly half a percent lower than last year and is the lowest rise of the six university increases announced so far.</p>
<p>“Lincoln University takes student concerns about fees very seriously,” said Vice-Chancellor Professor Roger Field.</p>
<p>“But we are also aware that the Government contribution per student has not matched the rate of inflation applying to universities. That sort of imbalance forces institutions to make decisions that we all know will be unpopular with our students. Unfortunately, however, we have little other option if we are to maintain the quality of our teaching, research and services as a responsible university.</p>
<p>“It’s an unfortunate fact - and I am sure our students will be aware of it as much anyone - but the level of public investment per student in New Zealand is about half that made by Australia on an equivalent purchasing basis, and about one third of that made in the United States.”</p>
<p>Lincoln’s fees are subject based and the new scale will be available on the University’s website from 19 November.</p>
