<p>Hon. Tony Ryall MP - National Law and Order spokesman</p>
<p>18 November 2004</p>
<p>Government&#39;s chain reaction of incompetence</p>
<p>There should be an urgent independent inquiry into a chain reaction of incompetence which allowed a refugee rapist to reoffend while on parole, says National&#39;s Law and Order spokesman, Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>He is commenting on the case of Iraqi refugee Abbas Al Baiiaty, who has been found guilty of abducting and raping a woman while on parole for three sex attacks.</p>
<p>&quot;Numerous government departments have failed in their core responsibilities to protect the women of this country from this reptile,&quot; Mr Ryall says.</p>
<p>&quot;First, there was no communication between Corrections, Internal Affairs or Immigration about his status when he was first convicted.</p>
<p>&quot;Then the Probation Service let him move to a hostel but did not tell the manager he was a sex offender on parole. If they had, the police would have realised who he was when they investigated complaints that he was sexually harassing women guests.</p>
<p>&quot;Then they lost track of him, and he resurfaced when he committed his latest offence while living unsupervised in a student hostel.</p>
<p>&quot;On top of all this, here we have the Government still allowing criminals to be released early on parole without proper supervision,&quot; Mr Ryall says. &quot;Parole is a failed experiment and this case proves it.</p>
<p>&quot;The frightening thing is that this could happen again. There are no systems in place to ensure such offenders are kicked out of the country on their release from prison.</p>
<p>&quot;An independent inquiry would make recommendations on information sharing and departmental practices, to ensure foreign-born offenders are deported. The inquiry would also highlight the disastrous state of the parole system.&quot;</p>
