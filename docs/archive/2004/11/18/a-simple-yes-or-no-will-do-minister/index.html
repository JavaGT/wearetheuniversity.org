<p>A Simple Yes Or No Will Do, Minister</p>
<p>Thursday 18 Nov 2004</p>
<p>Deborah Coddington - Press Releases -Education</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today called on Education Minister Trevor Mallard to stop being evasive with questions regarding the so-called &quot;historic&quot; 50 percent pay rise for qualified early childhood teachers.</p>
<p>&quot;In October the NZEI announced that the Government had given a commitment to funding pay parity for early childhood teachers, an announcement which raised staff expectations and placed huge pressure on employers,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Early Childhood Council suspected that no such commitment had been given. All that had happened was that the NZEI had negotiated a pay increase - over four years - for the tiny percentage of staff covered by the Consenting Parties Award - less than 8 percent of the early childhood sector.</p>
<p>&quot;I asked the Minister to confirm the date on which this commitment was given; if he stood by the NZEI&#39;s announcement; and to confirm the Government&#39;s funding of a 50 percent pay increase for early childhood teachers covered by the Consenting Parties Award.</p>
<p>&quot;In typical Mallard-speak he has evaded my questions and, instead, provided meaningless waffle about qualifications and goals.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister should show some responsibility for a change, and correct the misinformation being spread around the early childhood sector by the primary teachers&#39; union. All early childhood employers would love to pay their staff more, but most are responsible enough to act in good faith and not make promises they can&#39;t keep.</p>
<p>&quot;Meanwhile in Kawhia, one of the Waikato&#39;s most successful early childhood centres is going to the Hamilton High Court this Friday to fight the Minister&#39;s attempts to close it down. Why? Because they hired the best teacher for the job who, despite being fluent in Te Reo, doesn&#39;t happen to suit Mr Mallard&#39;s obsession for his type of qualification.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time this Minister stopped stamping all over the early childhood sector and showed the under-fives some support for a change,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
