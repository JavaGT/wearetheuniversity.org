<p>Sir Edmund Hillary Lends Name To New Waikato University Scholarships</p>
<p>Sir Edmund Hillary has agreed to lend his name to Waikato University’s new Parallel Development Programme (PDP) Scholarships for high-performing all-rounders. They will be known as the Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarships.</p>
<p>“These scholarships are designed to become New Zealand’s equivalent of the prestigious Rhodes Scholarships for multi-talented students destined to become future leaders,” says Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould. “I am extremely pleased that we will have someone of Sir Edmund’s stature associated with the scholarships.”</p>
<p>Also, on 14 December, the university is due to sign memorandum of understanding with a range of community organisations in the Waikato who will be supporting the PDP by providing training to students.</p>
<p>The scholarships, announced last month, are available to students who are academic high achievers and who also excel at either arts or sports.</p>
<p>The university believes that helping academically able artists and sportspeople to achieve all round excellence will deliver considerable benefits to the students themselves, the university in Hamilton and Tauranga, the Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions in particular, and the country in general. “The more we can do to assist these sorts of young people achieve their best the better for everyone concerned,” says Professor Gould.</p>
<p>Benefits of the new scheme include:</p>
<p>More top students studying, playing sport and creating art in Hamilton and the satellite campus in Tauranga, with flow on academic, economic, sporting and cultural benefits for the Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions. Scholars can also be expected to contribute in the national and international arenas.</p>
