<p>Hon Bill English National Education Spokesman</p>

<p>Schools suffer as intl’ students look elsewhere</p>
<p>A significant drop in international students will bite hard on secondary school budgets, says National’s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>“An informal survey carried out by my office shows that many schools are predicting a drop in international student numbers of between 30 and 50%,” he says.</p>
<p>“These schools stand to lose up to $200,000. This funding cut will likely lead to cuts in staff numbers and even more fees and fundraising for parents.” Last year, international students generated close to $113 million in extra revenue for schools. “Larger secondary schools may maintain their numbers, but most schools, which have less than 50 international students, will be hit hard,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>“Schools have been waiting and hoping that enough international students will show up, but now they are forced to redo their budgets based on reduced numbers and it’s not a pretty picture.”</p>
<p>“International students have provided schools with extra money to give them flexibility and the ability to provide educational opportunities that aren’t available through the Government’s limited operations grants.</p>
<p>“The decline in international student numbers will put further pressure on schools that are already struggling to make-up funding shortfalls and more pressure on Labour to increase school funding in the election year budget,” says Mr English.</p>
