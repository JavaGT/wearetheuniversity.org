<p>NZEI Supports Early Childhood Education Awareness Week</p>
<p>The country’s largest education union supports Early Childhood Education Awareness Week which began today.</p>
<p>The event is organised by Te Tari Puna Ora o Aotearoa/ the New Zealand Childcare Association to highlight the importance of early childhood education.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa represents 43,000 members working in all four education sectors: early childhood, primary, secondary and tertiary. Of this total 3500 NZEI members work as teachers and support staff in early childhood education centres.</p>
<p>“We fully support Early Childhood Education Awareness Week,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Colin Tarr.</p>
<p>“This year’s celebrations comes a month after NZEI gained pay parity for a thousand early childhood teachers working primarily in community-owned not-for-profit services.”</p>
<p>“This was an historic achievement as it will lift their salaries to the same level as teachers working in primary and secondary schools and free kindergartens.”</p>
<p>“This provides real recognition that the work early childhood teachers do is as important as their colleagues in primary and secondary schools and should be given equal value.”</p>
<p>“NZEI members support Early Childhood Awareness Week because they know from working in the education system how important it is for children to receive quality early childhood education.”</p>
<p>“This is because it lays a foundation on which children can build as they progress through primary and secondary school and on to tertiary education or into the workforce,” says Colin Tarr.</p>
