<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters - address to an East Coast public meeting St Andrews Hall, 176 Cobden Street, Gisborne at 12.30pm, Friday 19 November 2004.</p>
<p>&quot;This place was meant for you and me!&quot;</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>Today we come bearing a Christmas gift.</p>
<p>It might be a little early - but it is one of the best gifts New Zealanders could hope for and we hope that you enjoy it.</p>
<p>We in New Zealand First have secured the beaches for you forever.</p>
<p>So Merry Christmas from New Zealand First - enjoy your beach and your sea this summer.</p>
<p>The passing of the foreshore and seabed legislation in Parliament this week marked an historic moment for New Zealand.</p>
<p>Without New Zealand First&#39;s initiatives and support, the legislation would not have made it into Parliament.</p>
<p>Without our intervention, New Zealand would have been condemned to endless, fractious and pointless discord over the issue.</p>
<p>Because the foreshore and seabed issue was starting to resemble the Western Front in the First World War.</p>
<p>New Zealanders were becoming bogged down in a quagmire of increasingly specious and futile claims and counter claims.</p>
<p>The voices of sanity, reason and compromise were besieged by the extremists, the mischief makers and manipulators</p>
<p>Did New Zealanders want that?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>The huge majority of New Zealanders - fair minded, reasonable and sensible people - saw beyond the controversy and said to Parliament - fix it!</p>
<p>In other words the public looked to Parliament for leadership.</p>
<p>Advertisement - scroll to continue reading</p>
<p>One party, known for its ability to fix things, provided that leadership.</p>
<p>We took a stand.</p>
<p>And at the core of New Zealand First&#39;s stand was a simple test.</p>
<p>Where did the national interest lie in the seabed and foreshore issue?</p>
<p>Starting from that position we saw our task very clearly.</p>
<p>As a party, our aim was to ensure that the legislation would:</p>
<p>- serve the interests of all New Zealanders;</p>
<p>- provide an enduring basis for social harmony;</p>
<p>- be practical, reasoned and clear.</p>
<p>And that is what we have achieved.</p>
<p>The result is that now we can all go forward.</p>
<p>The legislation now vests ownership of the foreshore and seabed in the Crown on behalf of all New Zealanders and it protects customary rights for everyone.</p>
<p>Now we need not spend the next decade locked into an interminable squabble.</p>
<p>Make no mistake.</p>
<p>There are a number of interests that stood to gain by perpetuating controversy over the foreshore and seabed issue.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>- The Treaty Industry;</p>
<p>- The Media;</p>
<p>- The Maori Party:</p>
<p>- The National Party.</p>
<p>They all saw themselves as profiting from a divisive, bitter and endless squabble.</p>
<p>Today I am going to reveal some truths about this issue and like the old saying sometimes the truth hurts.</p>
<p>Perhaps the saddest thing about this entire seabed and foreshore issue has been the cruel hoax that some Maori have played on other Maori.</p>
<p>It was a malicious deception, creating false beliefs and hopes for something that was never there.</p>
<p>This issue goes back to June last year when the Court of Appeal released its decision on the Ngati Apa case.</p>
<p>Members of Ngati Apa had been trying for years to get permits from the Marlborough Council for marine farms, only to be constantly declined.</p>
<p>They went to court and appealed several times prior to the Court of Appeal decision.</p>
<p>Now here is what the Court of Appeal actually said - in its view the Maori Land Court could hear claims in relation to the seabed and foreshore.</p>
<p>And the judges also said that customary rights may not have been extinguished, but that they could not imagine a case where they would exist.</p>
<p>So how did we go from that to declarations that Maori owned the seabed and foreshore?</p>
<p>Easily - by the mischief makers at the far Left and the far Right with the total compliance of the media who actually had the judgement sitting in front of them.</p>
<p>They chose to leave it out of their reporting. It interfered with the headlines.</p>
<p>These people told you that Maori owned the seabed and foreshore.</p>
<p>They have a lot to answer for.</p>
<p>They sent thousands of Maori marching on Parliament.</p>
<p>They twisted the Court&#39;s ruling to suit their own ends.</p>
<p>Well we know who they are. Some of the same mischief makers have been bleeding the Treaty industry for years.</p>
<p>They are cynical and manipulative and saw an opening to add to the grievance industry.</p>
<p>This created unnecessary division, confusion and disharmony.</p>
<p>All New Zealanders, irrespective of race, deserved better than this.</p>
<p>They deserved the truth.</p>
<p>And again we were the party willing to give it to them.</p>
<p>The legislation has now been passed and we have seen off the mischief makers.</p>
<p>The legislation was needed to bring clarity to the issue and to spell out the rights of Maori.</p>
<p>It should have been resolved quickly and without political grandstanding.</p>
<p>We had all assumed that the Crown owned the seabed and foreshore.</p>
<p>What was required was to entrench this in law.</p>
<p>That was New Zealand First&#39;s position from the start, that is what New Zealanders wanted and now, thanks to New Zealand First, that is what the new law will do.</p>
<p>So all New Zealanders can go to the beach this Christmas knowing that the seabed and foreshore is in Crown ownership for all New Zealanders in perpetuity.</p>
<p>No one can sell it off, everyone has secure access and most importantly of all there is certainty about this.</p>
<p>It brings clarity where previously there was confusion.</p>
<p>So what else does the new law do?</p>
<p>- It guarantees public access;</p>
<p>- It secures customary rights for all New Zealanders - regardless of race;</p>
<p>- It ensures that we have one law for all New Zealanders in their access to the courts.</p>
<p>And this brings me to another myth that grew out of this debate.</p>
<p>Maori have not been denied their day in court.</p>
<p>That is how they will be able secure their territorial customary rights - through the courts.</p>
<p>So Maori have not been denied justice.</p>
<p>They have the same access to the courts as everybody else.</p>
<p>We also safeguarded legitimate business activities associated with the seabed and foreshore, such as port companies.</p>
<p>This was important because for a trading nation such as ours, the ability of ports to continue unencumbered is essential to our economic wellbeing.</p>
<p>Now let me repeat an assurance to Maori.</p>
<p>You have lost nothing.</p>
<p>You have a stake in the ownership of the foreshore and seabed through the Crown and more importantly - and your customary rights are now secure.</p>
<p>More secure than ever.</p>
<p>And along the coastline not far from here, it is likely the first customary territorial rights will be established.</p>
<p>The first seabed and foreshore reserves will be established and guardians appointed.</p>
<p>There is a very high threshold for establishing these rights.</p>
<p>Unbroken association since 1840 and ownership of the land next to the seabed and foreshore.</p>
<p>But - these areas cannot be roped off from the public and nor can any fee be charged.</p>
<p>The new law makes this clear.</p>
<p>When the debate started over this legislation members of parliament should have put their differences aside and acted in the national interest.</p>
<p>Instead, the National party in particular was guilty of confused and blatant politicking.</p>
<p>This was a further clear sign of their weak and confused leadership.</p>
<p>It lives in a perverse time warp in which there is no legitimate place for Maori except as subservient workers for their colonial masters.</p>
<p>The colonial tea planter strikes again.</p>
<p>National could have acted in the national interest but reverted to schoolyard tactics of juvenile protests with no substance.</p>
<p>This was a party that stated the seabed and foreshore must be in Crown ownership and agreed that customary rights had to be protected.</p>
<p>Then they voted against Crown ownership and customary rights.</p>
<p>Talk about confusion!</p>
<p>National, like every other party in parliament could have been part of this solution, but instead it chose to be a problem.</p>
<p>This is a disgraceful display from a party that used to believe in the name it bore.</p>
<p>Now we don&#39;t want to leave any false illusions about the political process and our cooperation with the Government.</p>
<p>We worked with Labour on this issue because it was in the national interest to do so. Just like we worked with Labour to set up a superannuation fund to help provide for New Zealanders when they retire.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake though to assume that our constructive relationship over the foreshore and seabed had any deeper meaning, beyond our commitment to achieve the best outcome for everyone.</p>
<p>Now I want to address very briefly one further issue that has arisen this past week.</p>
<p>The Government has unveiled a plan for a select committee to consider New Zealand&#39;s constitutional issues.</p>
<p>We in New Zealand First will not participate in this farce for it is truly a road to nowhere.</p>
<p>There are some issues Parliament is equipped to deal with but setting up a select committee of MPs to sort out the system under which we are governed is cynical and manipulative.</p>
<p>These MPs will work out what is best for MPs and political parties - not what is best for the rest of the people.</p>
<p>It is like putting a team of burglars in charge of security at a bank.</p>
<p>The select committee is simply not an appropriate forum for this type of discussion.</p>
<p>We in New Zealand First supported a commission of inquiry into the Treaty but the Government deceitfully abandoned this idea without telling us.</p>
<p>This select committee will be just like the select committee which looked into a review of MMP.</p>
<p>It was a sham, where self interested politicians looked after themselves. This will be no different.</p>
<p>We saw what happened when we debated the seabed and foreshore bill.</p>
<p>Extremists from National and Act claimed Maori were getting everything from this Bill while extremists of the Maori and Green parties claimed Maori had lost everything.</p>
<p>The facts were ignored. Their positions were entrenched.</p>
<p>This is what will happen in the select committee on the constitution. Entrenched positions will predetermine the outcomes.</p>
<p>This is not in the public interest and we will have no part of it. That committee will be disbanded after the next election - we promise you that.</p>
<p>New Zealand First pledges that any constitutional inquiry will be carried out by people of integrity outside the political system. MPs will be excluded - full stop!</p>
<p>There will be wide public consultation and a binding referendum on the outcome.</p>
<p>It is always better to trust the common sense of the people above the self interest of politicians.</p>
<p>Now, in conclusion we want to leave this thought with you.</p>
<p>We go into an election year next year.</p>
<p>When you go to the beach this summer, go fishing, swim or whatever, reflect on who it is you can really trust to look after your interests in Parliament.</p>
<p>As you watch the water lap over the foreshore, remember who secured it for you. Remember who put aside party politics in the interests of all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>We said we would fix it. We said it and we did it.</p>
