<p>Social engineering In Students&#39; Economics Tests</p>
<p>Wednesday 24 Nov 2004</p>
<p>Deborah Coddington - Press Releases - Primary &amp; Secondary Education</p>
<p>If ever parents needed proof that New Zealand&#39;s education standards have descended into pure brainwashing, they need look no further than this year&#39;s NCEA &#39;seventh form&#39; economics examination paper, ACT Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Take a look at these two gems:</p>
<p>&#39;The New Zealand government provides &#39;free&#39; education at state secondary schools. Explain why this results in a better resource allocation than the free market.&#39;</p>
<p>&#39;Explain why using &#39;free market&#39; policies causes income inequality.&#39;</p>
<p>Miss Coddington says no doubt the bonus question went along the lines of &quot;Ruth Richardson was a previous Finance Minister. How often did she kick her dog?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s way past time we overhauled our examination system. We need to bring intellectual rigour back into education and get rid of this Orwellian style revisionist history.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Coddington said it was time to start a campaign - &quot;TWO PLUS TWO MAKES FOUR&quot; - a quote taken from George Orwell&#39;s book, 1984: &quot;Trusims are true, hold on to that! The solid world exists, its laws do not change. Stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported fall toward the earth&#39;s centre. With the feeling that he was speaking to O&#39;Brien, and also that he was setting forth an important axiom, he wrote: Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two makes four. If that is granted, all else follows.&quot;</p>
