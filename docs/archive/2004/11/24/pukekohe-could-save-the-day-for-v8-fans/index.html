<p>Dr Paul Hutchison - MP for Port Waikato</p>
<p>24 November 2004</p>
<p>Pukekohe could save the day for V8 fans</p>
<p>Pukekohe could save the day for V8 supercar fans, says Port Waikato MP, Dr Paul Hutchison. “Now that the Auckland City Council and Mayor Hubbard have shut the door on the V8 street race, it’s time to reassess the Pukekohe venue beyond 2005. “Franklin Mayor, Mark Ball, is right behind the plan.</p>
<p>“We both believe that even the most diehard Auckland V8 fans, including former Mayor John Banks, in their hour of deepest depression would be delighted to see the V8 race continue at Pukekohe. “The existing track could be extended out onto the magnificent streets and country roads that go through New Zealand’s finest vegetable growing area, giving the race charm and challenge. Dr Hutchison says there’s a genuine carrot on offer at Pukekohe, despite the venue changing to meet the area’s equine needs.</p>
<p>The Chairman of Franklin Racing Club has said the generous deal done with the Auckland Racing Club to make Pukekohe a horse training centre of excellence might preclude the possibility of the V8 race continuing at Pukekohe. Dr Hutchison says it would be a win-win for Pukekohe, the Franklin Racing Club, and supercar fans.</p>
<p>“The race would still remain north of the Bombay Hills, and continue the V8 tradition at Pukekohe. “The good people of Franklin want to come to the aid of Auckland V8 fans depressed by the decision of the new city council.”</p>
