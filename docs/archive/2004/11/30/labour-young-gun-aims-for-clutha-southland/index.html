<p>Labour young gun aims for Clutha-Southland</p>
<p>Giving Clutha-Southland locals to chance to vote Labour for a change is what it’s all about for the new Labour candidate for Clutha-Southland, 29 year old David Talbot.</p>
<p>“I am proud to be part of a great team led by Helen Clark which has brought jobs and prosperity to the people in the diverse communities of Clutha-Southland,” he said.</p>
<p>David Talbot is undaunted by the prospect of standing against the Wellington-based incumbent MP for Clutha-Southland.</p>
<p>“The economy is going so well the Opposition doesn’t want to make it an election issue. We’ve got news for them – we do!</p>
<p>“Labour has a fantastic story to tell in this electorate and around the country with a growing economy, much lower unemployment, rising education standards, better access to healthcare and falling crime rates”.</p>
<p>“And hand in hand with a growing economy New Zealanders up and down the country are feeling proud of who and what we are with Kiwi film and music and our sports people, businesses and high achievers attracting international recognition,” said David Talbot.</p>
<p>David Talbot studied at Otago University and is not afraid of hard work or a grueling schedule: following his studies he spent time in Belgium as a full-time competitive cyclist.</p>
