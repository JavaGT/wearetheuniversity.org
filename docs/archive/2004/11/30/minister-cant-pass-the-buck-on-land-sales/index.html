<p><strong>Tuesday, 30 November 2004, 5:25 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon David Carter - National Party MP</p>
<p>30 November 2004</p>
<p>Minister can&#39;t pass the buck on land sales</p>
<p>&quot;It is totally irresponsible of Treaty Negotiations Minister Margaret Wilson to blame the National Party for the way Ngai Tahu is buying and selling surplus Crown land at huge profits,&quot; says National Party MP David Carter.</p>
<p>&quot;The law passed by National required Ngai Tahu to pay full market value for any surplus Crown land, and my investigations show this isn&#39;t happening.</p>
<p>&quot;In some cases, Ngai Tahu has pre-sold land at a huge profit to a third party - even before the official deal with the tribe has been finalised.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, Ngai Tahu made a $3 million profit on the sale of Tirimoana, a North Canterbury property, which it sold 59 days before it officially bought it.</p>
<p>&quot;The policy of the previous National Government was that the land-banked properties would be sold at market value. These properties are clearly not being sold at market rates when there are such big profits being made.</p>
<p>&quot;The Office Of Treaty Settlements must review its valuation procedures. There is clearly a big problem that is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s nothing short of an outrage that after five years Margaret Wilson admits she has done nothing and, it would seem, doesn&#39;t care either,&quot; says Mr Carter.</p>
