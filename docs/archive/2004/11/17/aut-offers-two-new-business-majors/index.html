<p>AUT Offers Two New Business Majors</p>
<p>AUT is offering two new majors in the Faculty of Business to respond to increasing demand by executives and post-graduate students and from industry.</p>
<p>FINANCE The Finance department will open its doors in 2005, with a top-class postgraduate programme in place.</p>
<p>The 10-strong department will be led by Dr. Alireza Tourani-Rad and a team of eminent academics drawn from Singapore, the USA, Germany and the Netherlands. They will teach and research all facets of finance including corporate finance, investments, financial markets, international finance and risk management.</p>
<p>The AUT Faculty of Business has set up this new department to explore one of the most critical sectors in the modern economy. The Finance major of the AUT Postgraduate programmes are primarily concerned with how individuals and organisations raise money and capital, and how those resources are allocated among competing investment opportunities.</p>
<p>Post-graduate papers offered in the Finance major include: Advanced topics in Corporate Finance Advanced topics in Investments Risk and Portfolio Management Forecasting Techniques in Financial Markets.</p>
<p>Heading the team, as Professor of Finance, is Dr Tourani-Rad who joined AUT in 2004. He has an extensive background in the finance and investment fields and is a Senior Associate of the Australasian Institute of Banking and Finance.</p>
<p>Dr Dimitri Margaritis, Professor of International Finance, is another leading figure of the new department who has extensive policy experience, having served as Advisor and Manager of the Research Section of the Reserve Bank of NZ (1990-1991) and Senior Research Fellow at the Bank (1992-1996). He also served on panels of experts for the NZ Treasury and the Ministry of Economic Development.</p>
