<p>Pharmac review glosses over concerns</p>
<p>Pharmac&#39;s Annual Review, released today, glosses over significant concerns of the past year, says National&#39;s Associate Health spokesman, Dr Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;The review might boast availability of some new drugs but, when it comes to choice, New Zealand&#39;s is not as good as Australia&#39;s.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Hutchison says Pharmac has served New Zealand very well in terms of keeping costs down, but the annual review ignores a number of bad news stories.</p>
<p>* Tens of thousands of patients were forced to change their cholesterol-lowering medication and no safety monitoring provisions were made for the switch. Pharmac and the Health Ministry could be accused of negligence for that failure!</p>
<p>* Some terminally ill cancer patients were unable to access a morphine sulphate pain relief agent.</p>
<p>* Many drugs, such as the common anti-gout drug Allopurinol, have simply not been available. Pharmac&#39;s sole supply policies are partly to blame.</p>
<p>* Pfizer Pharmaceuticals withdrew a grant of $65 million to New Zealand researchers. Pfizer said it was because it could no longer have a sensible dialogue with Pharmac or the Government.</p>
<p>* The pharmaceutical budget&#39;s expenditure was downgraded from $566 million to $541 million in the past financial year due to the delayed introduction of low drug co-payments from 1 October 2003 to 1 August 2004. The $25 million not spent could have funded the breast cancer drugs Pharmac says it has no money for.</p>
<p>Dr Hutchison says National wants a full review of the agency because beneath the gloss there are some deep concerns.</p>
