<p>Otago Business School Team In Case Competition Final</p>
<p>A team of four School of Business students at the University of Otago have reached the finals of a prestigious international Business Case Competition and will travel to Atlanta, Georgia in the USA to compete against four international teams.</p>
<p>Representing the “rest of the world” region in the PIM International Case Competition, the Otago team achieved the second highest overall score in a virtual competition run last month. The group presented their case to the international judges via an electronic connection over the weekend of the 15th October.</p>
<p>“The students’ achievement is fantastic, though it is a little overwhelming to be in finals, and sorting out the logistics of logistics of competing in the USA,” said Virginia Phillips, Co-Manager of the Otago team.</p>
<p>The team, comprising Brian Casey, Paul Chong, Iain Grant and Hayden Starkey, successfully competed at two national business case competitions earlier this year. The team won the regional heats of the New Zealand Business Case Competition in May and went on to compete at the national final in Hamilton in July.</p>
<p>The team will now travel to Atlanta, Georgia in early December to compete against fellow graduates from four international business schools which are members of the Program in International Management (PIM) (at last count there were 53 members). The final winning team will receive an $US8000 cash prize. The competition is being organised by the Goizueta Business School at Emory University and the University of North Carolina’s Kenan-Flager Business School.</p>
<p>“We are confident that the Otago team will perform well on the international stage. We learned from our experience with the team we took to the Copenhagen Business School earlier this year that Otago teams are as good as any in the world, and we look forward to this opportunity to compete in the finals in Georgia, USA in December, said John Guthrie, Co-Manager of the Otago team.</p>
