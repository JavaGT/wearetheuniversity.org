<p>Formula race car at Big Boys Toys</p>
<p>The country&#39;s first Formula SAE race car will be unveiled at Big Boys Toys in Auckland tomorrow (November 12).</p>
<p>The formula style race car has been designed and built over the last five months by a team of mechanical engineering students from The University of Auckland as part of the Australian Formula SAE competition.</p>
<p>The Formula SAE stand will be located in the Best of Kiwi area, thanks to the generous sponsorship of Big Boys Toys.</p>
<p>Faculty of Engineering Dean Professor Peter Brothers says the University acknowledges the tremendous support of local industry.</p>
<p>&quot;We are delighted to send New Zealand&#39;s first team to what is an extremely competitive and challenging event. We are particularly pleased with the many engineering and motor sport industry members who have come on board to support the students,&quot; says Professor Brothers.</p>
<p>Team Manager and final year mechanical engineering student Chris Paykel says the team has been working hard to get the car ready for Big Boys Toys as well as the competition in Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;We are thrilled to be part of Big Boys Toys and have been really busy preparing for it. The last couple of weeks have been particularly challenging as we put in long hours completing finishing touches on the car and studying for our final University exams,&quot; says Chris.</p>
<p>On display at the Formula SAE stand will be the car in its competition-ready state and video footage of design, construction and testing. Visitors to the stand will also have an opportunity to purchase a Team Supporter Pack, including the chance to win one of three Hot Laps sessions in the NZ Championship winning Battery Town Porshe GT3 Cup, driven by champion driver Mike Weeks.</p>

<p>Formula SAE is a year-long competition which involves university teams throughout the world designing and constructing a formula style race car. The Auckland team is the first and only New Zealand team to compete in the event, which attracts teams from Australia, America, Japan and Europe. The competition requires teams to design and produce a prototype race car costing no more than AUS$50,000.</p>
<p>The Auckland team will take on the world&#39;s best at the Australian competition in Melbourne in early December.</p>
