<p>Hon Bill English National Education Spokesman</p>
<p>16 November 2004</p>
<p>Mallard adds to schools&#39; funding problems</p>
<p>National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English, says Labour&#39;s school-funding policies rely on mid- to high-decile schools charging fees to parents.</p>
<p>But in Parliament last week, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said he &#39;condemned&#39; schools demanding the payment of fees and said he intended to put a stop to the practice.</p>
<p>Mr English says that if Mr Mallard follows through on this threat, some supposedly well-off schools could find themselves in serious financial trouble.</p>
<p>Decile 8-10 secondary schools receive $1,375 less government funding per student than decile 1-3 schools. Decile 8-10 primary schools receive $909 less per student than decile 1-3 schools.</p>
<p>&quot;The invoices flooding into my office show that mid-high decile schools are making up some of the shortfall by charging between $160 and $200 in fees,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>In 2003, 167 schools raised more money locally - including through the collection of school fees - than they actually received from the Government. Schools collected about $200 million in parental contributions and donations in 2003 - 34% more than in 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;The loss of that kind of money will really hurt schools already struggling to provide quality education,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;Schools I have spoken to are worried that the Minister&#39;s public attack on the payment of school fees will mean fewer parents are willing to pay them. This is a real concern when their financial viability depends on what proportion of fees they can collect.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents provide the millions that the Minister won&#39;t because they want the best available education for their kids, even if he doesn&#39;t,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
