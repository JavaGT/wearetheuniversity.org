<p>Delegates Gather in the Capital For Meeting with PM</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and Senior Government figures will this evening meet with around 300 union delegates in a major cross-union gathering in Wellington.</p>
<p>Representatives from the Council of Trade Union’s 34 affiliate unions are meeting with Prime Minister Helen Clark, as well as Paul Swain, Ruth Dyson, Steve Maharey and David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“The forum is an opportunity for the Prime Minister and other Ministers to talk directly to union members about issues affecting workers – not only in the workplace but also their wider concerns about the economy and society,” said CTU secretary Carol Beaumont.</p>
<p>The meeting will break into workshop groups which will discuss specific topics with the relevant Government spokesperson. The workshops will be on the areas of employment relations, migration and productivity; work-life balance and pay equity; skills, training and tertiary education; state sector issues and education; and trade.</p>
<p>Carol Beaumont said it was important for political leaders to engage with workers about strategies for economic growth which required a highly-skilled and motivated workforce.</p>
