<p>Hon Bill English National Education Spokesman</p>
<p>12 November 2004</p>
<p>Mallard creates another smokescreen</p>
<p>Trevor Mallard is up to his usual tricks of shooting his mouth off to avoid dealing with the fact that his childcare policy is a mess, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>National Leader Don Brash today launched an attack on Labour&#39;s early childhood education policy that subsidises childcare, but only for children enrolled in non-profit centres.</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard&#39;s claims that Dr Brash and I are at odds over what National will do with the policy are rubbish,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;National will ensure taxpayer subsidies for childcare are distributed fairly. Labour, on the other hand, thinks some children are worth more than others.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a Minister that can&#39;t even implement stage one of his childcare strategy and have all childcare supervisors registered, let alone a complex bureaucratic proposal like this.</p>
<p>&quot;His own officials have advised him that, as a result of this policy, up to 400 childcare centres will close on January 1 next year, affecting about 45,000 young children.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a major crisis of the Minister&#39;s own making. He should deal with it before he wrecks the childcare arrangements of thousands of working families.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard&#39;s petty political outburst shows that he is more interested in point-scoring than the welfare of the thousands of children for whom he is responsible,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
