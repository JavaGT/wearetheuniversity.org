<p>Time To Show Mallard We&#39;ve Had Enough</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today urged New Zealanders to voice their anger over Labour&#39;s school closures by marching on Parliament on February 24.</p>
<p>&quot;It is time to show Education Minister Trevor Mallard that we have had enough. His supreme arrogance has seen him ride roughshod over entire communities, and closed our schools,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;I am calling on parents, teachers and students - indeed, anyone who is concerned about the quality of education in this country - to turn out en masse and shame the Labour Government into reversing the worst excesses of its network reviews.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has axed 71 schools, and plans to close over 300 in the next seven years. Mr Mallard has decided that penny-pinching is more important than parental choice and our right to give our children a quality education.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly, this Minister has lost the plot. ACT is urging communities to join us in the fight against school closures, and send a strong signal to Mr Mallard - and his Labour cronies - by turning up on February 24. Our schools and communities are worth it - it&#39;s time to take action, before it&#39;s too late,&quot; Miss Coddington said.  </p>
