<p><strong>Tuesday, 24 February 2004, 9:08 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Victory for parent power</p>
<p>The Labour Government&#39;s backdown on its schools closure programme will further stoke the anger of thousands of families caught up in the current reviews, says National Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>Education Minister Trevor Mallard is still to confirm the closure of up to 71 schools in areas around the country, including Invercargill, Upper Hutt and Timaru.</p>
<p>&quot;I am urging the Minister to back away from this savage culling and go easy on these schools,&quot; Mr English says.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s unfair to proceed with closures in Timaru and Invercargill when other communities will now have no closures. Seventy-one schools will close just because the change in political polls was three months too late.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s announcement has made parents even angrier</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister has an obligation to act consistently and listen to the concerns of parents in these areas.</p>
<p>&quot;Other communities have been saved by Labour&#39;s backdown.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision is a reaction to the significant pressure applied by communities and spear-headed by National through our &quot;skools&quot; website and postcard campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;Communities are telling us that any changes to schools should be driven by parents&#39; choices and local control.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has paid a heavy price for being out of step with public opinion again.&quot;  </p>
