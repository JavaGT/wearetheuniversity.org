<p>Crowd Urges Mallard To Re-think School Closures</p>
<p>Tuesday 24 Feb 2004 Deborah Coddington Press Releases -- Education -- Save Our Schools</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington was today delighted - but unsurprised - at the number of people protesting Labour&#39;s school closures, and said it was just a fraction of the anger that communities feel about this misguided initiative.</p>
<p>&quot;Today&#39;s demonstration shows that Kiwis will not forfeit their children&#39;s education without a fight. Everyone with a jot of sense sees the absurdity of Education Minister Trevor Mallard&#39;s network reviews - except the Minister himself,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not surprised that so many turned out - from Taranaki, Manawatu, Wairoa, Wairarapa, and as far afield as Greymouth - to protest this attack on their communities. If future reviews are bad - as Mr Mallard claims - then why are the current ones okay? The Minister must dump this policy and let parents choose.</p>
<p>&quot;I was also delighted to receive the petition from Pinehaven School parents, signed by thousands of New Zealanders, demanding that Labour end this brutal cull of our schools.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard&#39;s penny-pinching will have a devastating effect on communities. Teachers will be forced to reapply for their jobs, children will have their education disrupted, and schools will inevitably lose some of their community support.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT accepts that schools will, from time-to-time, close or merge. But that decision must be made by the communities affected - not by a Minister whose prime motivation is to save a buck. I urge parents, students and teachers to continue the fight to save their schools - there&#39;s a long way to go,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
