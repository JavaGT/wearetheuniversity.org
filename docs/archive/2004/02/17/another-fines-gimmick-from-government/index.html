<p>Another fines gimmick from Government</p>
<p>The Government should be doing more to collect the $500 million dollars owed in outstanding fines, says National&#39;s Police spokesman Tony Ryall.</p>
<p>He is commenting on a Government advertising campaign launched today targeting young male fine defaulters.</p>
<p>&quot;A couple of weeks of billboards on buses is nothing more than a costly gimmick,&quot; says Mr Ryall. &quot;It misses two-thirds of the offenders and people without cars!</p>
<p>&quot;Defaulters know the Government isn&#39;t serious when thousands of dollars worth of fines can be replaced with a few hours of community work. Last year a North Island woman had $36,000 in fines wiped in return for 250 hours of community work.</p>
<p>Mr Ryall is also calling for a greater use of attachment orders (automatic deductions) on wages and benefits, and the seizure of assets to pay back these debts.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Government was serious about fine defaulters it would be accelerating proposed government department information-sharing legislation which would make it easier find defaulters.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect this latest move is a response to National&#39;s strong summer campaign highlighting the half billion of outstanding fines,&quot; said Mr Ryall.</p>
