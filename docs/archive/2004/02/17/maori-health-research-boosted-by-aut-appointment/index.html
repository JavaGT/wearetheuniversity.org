<p><strong>Tuesday, 17 February 2004, 10:34 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology">Auckland University of Technology</a></strong></p>
<p>Maori health research and education to receive a significant boost with new appointment</p>
<p>New Zealand’s first female Associate Professor in Maori Health, Dr Mihi Ratima (Te Whakatohea and Ngati Awa), has been appointed at Auckland University of Technology’s Faculty of Health.</p>
<p>As a former World Health Organisation (WHO) analyst, diplomat whose work focussed on the Pacific region, recipient of the Health Research Council Erihapeti Murchie Postdoctoral Fellowship and Fulbright Scholar, Dr Ratima will bring expertise in Maori and indigenous peoples’ health, public health, health promotion, and research.</p>
<p>“It is an exciting challenge to be the first professorial level appointment to specialise in Maori health at AUT,” says Dr Ratima.</p>
<p>Professor Max Abbott, Dean, Faculty of Health, said, “The appointment aims to strengthen Maori leadership within the Faculty, enhance research and teaching in Maori health and contribute to the health of Maori people. It is an expression of the University’s commitment to Maori health development and to meeting its Treaty of Waitangi obligations.”</p>
<p>“This newly created position provides an opportunity for AUT to more fully realise its potential contribution to improving Maori health outcomes. AUT has a central role to play in enhancing Maori health academic capacity, expanding the Maori professional health workforce and in research collaboration with Maori. The establishment of this position provides a clear Maori health focus within AUT, and will be important in strengthening links with Maori communities and Maori health research, education and service providers,” explains Dr Ratima.</p>
