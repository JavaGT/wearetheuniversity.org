<p>Hardened Crims Too Soft For Cold Showers?</p>
<p>Tuesday 17 Feb 2004 Stephen Franks Press Releases -- Crime &amp; Justice</p>
<p>If prison inmates have found three days without hot water so uncomfortable as to issue riot threats, then perhaps the hot water should be left off a lot longer, ACT New Zealand Corrections Spokesman Stephen Franks said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The bleeding hearts tell us these criminals only offend because they&#39;re from deprived, disadvantaged backgrounds. It certainly hasn&#39;t hardened them up if they can&#39;t take what thousands of Kiwi families enjoy while camping every summer,&quot; Mr Franks said.</p>
<p>&quot;The these criminals can even credibly threaten to riot - and for such a trivial reason - shows how soft and apologetic our prison policy is. Now they&#39;ve shown how much they fear cold showers, Corrections Minister Paul Swain should introduce a permanent cold water policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Would-be criminals might think twice before committing a crime if they found prison uncomfortable - and if they don&#39;t offend, they can stay in their hot showers at home as long as they like.</p>
<p>&quot;Surely even the Labour Government couldn&#39;t argue that cold water is unhealthy. Do prisoners have a right to uninterrupted hot water? Thousands of people have been raised in the belief that cold showers are healthier than hot ones.</p>
<p>&quot;What about a permanent cold water policy, Minister?&quot; Mr Franks said.</p>
