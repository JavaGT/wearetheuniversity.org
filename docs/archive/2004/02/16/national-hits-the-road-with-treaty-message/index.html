<p><strong>Monday, 16 February 2004, 11:46 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National hits the road with Treaty message</p>
<p>National Leader Don Brash has taken the message from his Orewa speech on New Zealand nationhood to Rotorua, in the first of a series of provincial tours.</p>
<p>&quot;National wants New Zealand to be a modern democratic society, with one rule for all in a single nation state. The alternative is a racially divided nation, with two sets of laws, and two standards of citizenship, that the present Labour Government is moving us steadily towards,&quot; said Dr Brash.</p>
<p>&quot;A whole range of legislation now includes reference to Treaty principles without any explanation of what those principles are, or how they work. That is why today I am announcing that the National Party will be commissioning research into the complex task of removing racial preferences from legislation, starting with the Resource Management Act.</p>
<p>&quot;This research will be started immediately and will be made public when completed.</p>
<p>&quot;Any body can see that it is simply absurd to suggest that a speech asserting the principle of &quot;equality for all before the law&quot; is divisive and racist.</p>
<p>&quot;Others have claimed that I was trashing the Treaty. Yet I explicitly stated that the Treaty&#39;s three simple clauses must be upheld. That the Treaty is a founding document is obvious to all. But the Treaty alone is not an adequate constitutional basis for a modern state.</p>
<p>&quot;Some have suggested that none of this matters, because some of the race-based preferences are relatively trivial. But the plain fact of the matter is that the public of New Zealand has witnessed a parade of race-based political correctness over the past decade or more - cultural safety in nursing, taniwha stopping roading projects, consultations with iwi blocking routine university research, frogs being escorted by groups of Kaumatua, and so on.</p>

<p>&quot;Individual cases may be trivial, even laughable, but collectively the pattern is concerning and never-ending. National will put a stop to this, and refocus government assistance on the basis of need, not race.</p>
<p>&quot;I am heartened by the public reaction to National&#39;s message, from both Maori and non-Maori, but there is still a long way to go. This provincial tour is just the start of the work ahead,&quot; said Dr Brash.  </p>
