<p><strong>Thursday, 5 February 2004, 9:12 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Peace_Action_Wellington">Peace Action Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Howard is the crim, not anti-war activists</p>
<p>Anti-war activists in Wellington will be picketing the Australian Embassy on Thursday morning from 7:30-9:30 to demand justice for the &#39;Opera House 2&#39; - the two Australian anti-war activists sentenced to 9 months in prison for painting NO WAR on the Sydney Opera House.</p>
<p>&#39;It is a grotesque travesty of justice that these two people are being sent to prison for 9 months while John Howard who participated in an illegal war on Iraq, which as resulted in the death of thousands of innocent people, escapes without penalty. He is the war criminal.&#39; said Peace Action Wellington member Valerie Morse</p>
<p>&#39;The Australian Parliament should be conducting an inquiry into Howard&#39;s decision to go to war. His actions are without justification and such an inquiry would demonstrate that he was clearly in violation of international law and responsible for war crimes.&#39;</p>
<p>&#39;These responsible citizens should be applauded by the Australian people as representing the real view of average Australians on the war. Here in Wellington, we will be alerting the Embassy staff that New Zealanders condemn the behaviour of their Government and judiciary.&#39;</p>
<p>Peace Action Wellington demands an immediate and unconditional end to the occupation of Iraq.  </p>
