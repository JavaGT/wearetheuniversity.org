<p>Business Roundtable Launches New Resource for Journalists and Students</p>
<p>The New Zealand Business Roundtable today launched a new online resource designed for journalists, students, and others interested in public policy issues.</p>
<p>The Policy Backgrounder series will cover a variety of topics and present relevant economic analysis and research.</p>
<p>&quot;The Business Roundtable has always sought to establish a strong research base to its policy advocacy,&quot; executive director Roger Kerr said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The Policy Backgrounder series is a logical extension of our work, providing readers with an easy-to-access, thorough review of topical issues, and an extensive list of recommended reading.&quot;</p>
<p>Six Policy Backgrounders have so far been commissioned from independent authors, covering issues ranging from the minimum wage to US welfare reforms. They will be released over the coming months.</p>
<p>Today, the Business Roundtable published the first of these documents, examining Pay Equity.</p>
<p>Written by Wellington-based economist Justin Coutts of the Law and Economics Consulting Group, this document addresses the question: Are pay equity policies to close the &#39;pay gap&#39; between men and women desirable?</p>
<p>This Policy Backgrounder is available from today on the NZBR website: <a href="http://www.nzbr.org.nz">www.nzbr.org.nz</a></p>
