<p>National symposium to focus on collaboration between researchers and clinicians</p>
<p>The successful transfer of ideas from the laboratory to the clinic will be the focus of a national symposium at The University of Auckland&#39;s Tamaki Campus this week.</p>
<p>The inaugural symposium, Movement Analysis 2004, will be held at Tamaki on February 27 and 28 and will bring together researchers from a number of universities and clinicians nationwide.</p>
<p>Dr Uwe Kersting, from the Faculty of Science&#39;s Biomechanics Laboratory, says the symposium was developed to advance knowledge in clinical areas and apply scientific developments to the &quot;real world&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to bridge the gap between the clinical field and the research area and provide a forum for developing new ideas in collaboration,&quot; says Dr Kersting.</p>
<p>&quot;Researchers and clinicians can work extremely well together for the benefit of staff and patients. For example, the Biomechanics Laboratory has a good relationship with Auckland&#39;s Starship Hospital working with children with cerebral palsy.&quot;</p>
<p>As part of the symposium, researchers from the University of Auckland will highlight recent developments in various areas of clinical biomechanics research including: clinical gait analysis for children with cerebral palsy, balance across the age spectrum, efficacy of routine clinical assessments, role of biomechanics in podiatry and injury prevention.</p>
<p>Another highlight of the symposium will be a presentation from Dr Dieter Rosenbaum from the University of Münster, Germany, who will talk about the clinical applications in the treatment of diabetic foot syndrome.</p>
<p>Workshops will also allow participants to get hands-on experience using the equipment at the Department of Sport and Exercise Science at Tamaki, one of the leading centres in Human Movement Analysis in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The University&#39;s Tamaki Campus is an inter-disciplinary, research-intensive campus, focusing on a range of themes including health, psychology and sports science. Tamaki&#39;s facilities are used by students, academics and external agencies.  </p>
