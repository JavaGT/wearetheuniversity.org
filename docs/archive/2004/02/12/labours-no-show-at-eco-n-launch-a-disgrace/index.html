<p>Labour&#39;s No Show At ECO-N Launch A Disgrace</p>
<p>Thursday 12 Feb 2004 Gerry Eckhoff Press Releases -- Rural</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Rural Affairs Spokesman Gerry Eckhoff today welcomed the launch of ECO-N - a new product to reduce nitrate leaching into waterways - but was disappointed at Labour&#39;s failure to send a representative.</p>
<p>&quot;Developed by Lincoln University, in partnership with farmer-owned Ravensdown Fertiliser, ECO-N could be one of the most significant pastoral farming advances since the 19^th Century development of super phosphate,&quot; Mr Eckhoff said.</p>
<p>&quot;By reducing the amount of nitrate leaching into waterways, by up to 60 percent, ECO-N will have an enormous impact on the environment. This will contribute enormously to water quality - especially within dairy farming regions, where Fish &amp; Game has been hugely critical of dairy farming practices.</p>
<p>&quot;The failure of both Fish &amp; Game, and Labour, to send representatives to this auspicious launch did not go unnoticed by the 500 farmers in attendance. I was sad to see that, although not the only Parliamentarian invited, I was the only one who understood the significance of the event and turned up.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s insulting that the Government did not send a representative to the launch of this revolutionary product - which will have positive implications world-wide. This no show is indicative of Labour&#39;s attitude towards the agriculture sector,&quot; Mr Eckhoff said.</p>
