<p>Better Use For Health Dollars</p>
<p>Monday 9 Feb 2004 Heather Roy Press Releases -- Health</p>
<p>Auckland District Health Board Chair Wayne Brown&#39;s suggestion today, that Auckland&#39;s three DHBs could make significant savings by jointly outsourcing administrative work, is encouraging, ACT New Zealand Health Spokesman Heather Roy said today.</p>
<p>&quot;The three Auckland Boards already collaborate in many areas, resulting in significant savings of precious health dollars,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to save health dollars, administration work should be tendered out, and those individuals or companies able to provide the best quality service at the lowest cost contracted to provide it. If the DHB employees currently doing the job are the most competitive, they should receive the contract.</p>
<p>&quot;The healthAlliance - Counties-Manukau and Waitemata DHBs&#39; joint administrative services company - says it would welcome Auckland DHB coming on board. Clearly, there are further savings yet to be made - the matter of just who will provide these services is academic.</p>
<p>&quot;Health dollars should be spent on treating those in need of care. Such a pro-active move would allow more effective use of taxpayers&#39; money,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
