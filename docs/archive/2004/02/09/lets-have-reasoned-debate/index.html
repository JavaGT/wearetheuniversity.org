<p><strong>Monday, 9 February 2004, 5:48 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Don Brash MP</p>
<p>National Party Leader</p>
<p>9th February 2004</p>
<p>Let&#39;s have reasoned debate</p>
<p>National Party leader Don Brash has flatly rejected suggestions from Prime Minister Helen Clark that he was inciting civil unrest with a newspaper advertising campaign on Labour&#39;s seabed and foreshore proposals, to be run tomorrow.</p>
<p>Dr Brash said the public was entitled to see the deception involved in the Government&#39;s conflicting statements.</p>
<p>&quot;On the one hand the Prime Minister says the Government is &#39;acting in the interests of all New Zealanders.&#39; But at the same time the Government&#39;s top legal advisor, Solicitor-General Terence Arnold, QC, was telling the Waitangi Tribunal the Labour Government&#39;s proposals conferred &#39;a real power&#39; to Maori, including veto rights.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark simply cannot be allowed to get away with this duplicity.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year we exposed similar duplicity when the Internal Affairs Department was producing two brochures, saying one thing in English and spinning another story in Maori for a different audience. As a result of our actions in revealing this, the brochures had to be pulped, costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Brash said the advertising campaign would be uncomfortable for the Prime Minister, but it served her right for deliberately withholding details of the Government&#39;s plans till the day after Parliament had risen last year.</p>
