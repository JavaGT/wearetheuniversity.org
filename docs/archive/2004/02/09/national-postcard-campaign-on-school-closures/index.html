<p>Hon Bill English MP<br>National Education Spokesperson<br>9th February 2004</p>
<p>National launches postcard campaign on school closures</p>
<p>Parents who are angry about school closures will get an opportunity to register their protest to the Government through the National post card campaign, says National&#39;s Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>National has delivered 70,000 postcards to every home in Invercargill, Timaru, Upper Hutt, Grey Valley, Wairoa and Matakaoa.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents and other members of the community can fill out the petition form on the back of the postcard and I will transmit these to the Government.</p>
<p>&quot;Wide-spread school closures have ripped the heart out of education in many communities. The Government would be making a big mistake to assume that sullen acceptance by these communities means agreement with what has happened.</p>
<p>&quot;These communities have lost control of their destiny. Successful and strongly supported schools have been closed and long-standing relationships between schools and families have been broken, and parents of the future have lost their choices.</p>
<p>&quot;I urge everyone to fill out the postcard because a strong signal to the Government will stop Labour&#39;s plans to close schools in another 10 communities this year.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a follow-up to National&#39;s website <a href="http://www.skools.co.nz">www.skools.co.nz</a> , which provides information for parents, teachers and students about the network review and provides the opportunity for feedback from the affected communities,&quot; said Mr English.</p>
