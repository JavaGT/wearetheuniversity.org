<p>School Closures Cynical Penny-pinching</p>
<p>Education Minister Trevor Mallard&#39;s arrogant and cynical penny-pinching has taken a turn for the worse highlighted by his announcement last night that six Northland schools are to be closed, ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents, students and teachers will be devastated. Through Labour&#39;s cruel network reviews, Mr Mallard is ripping the heart out of Northland communities - which have had strongly-supported well-performing schools,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister claims that network reviews are upsetting for him - but his crocodile tears won&#39;t wash with Northlanders. The grim reality is that teachers will be forced to reapply for their jobs, children&#39;s education will be disrupted, and schools will lose some community support.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard constantly shows scant regard for the wishes of rural communities, who have begged for a stay of execution - despite claiming in Opposition that only Labour was `watching out for the interests of small rural communities and the needs of small rural schools&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;It now appears that excellent ERO reports, strong community support and growing rolls matter little to this arrogant Minister, whose prime motivation is to save money - regardless of the best interests of rural communities.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s savage approach to closing schools shows that it&#39;s out of touch with provincial New Zealand. ACT accepts schools will, from time-to-time, close or merge. But that decision must be made by the communities affected - not by a know-it-all government that prefers bullying heartland New Zealand, rather than consulting it,&quot; Miss Coddington said.  </p>
