<p>MEDIA RELEASE<br>For Immediate Use</p>
<p>Ongoing Funding Confirmed for New Drug Research at The University of Auckland</p>
<p>The longstanding relationship between Pfizer and the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences at The University of Auckland has been reaffirmed with the announcement of a renewed research contract that will extend the work of the Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre into the field of antibiotic discovery.</p>
<p>Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences Dean Peter Smith said the continuation of funding was an acknowledgement of the University and New Zealand’s research excellence.</p>
<p>“This extended contract is a demonstration of the international community’s confidence in our work. With this relationship with Pfizer assured for another ten years, the University will make a major contribution to antibiotic development and the treatment of infectious disease.”</p>
<p>The continuing contract is valued at approximately NZ $4 million a year, and has provisions to help the University expand research capacity at the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences.</p>
<p>“This partnership will enable New Zealand to make a significant contribution to the global fight against infectious disease,” Professor Smith said.</p>
