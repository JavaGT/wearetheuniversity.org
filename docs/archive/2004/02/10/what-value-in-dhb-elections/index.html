<p>What Value In DHB Elections?</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Health Spokesman Heather Roy today agreed with Dame Susan Devoy&#39;s questioning of the value of District Health Board elections and said that, with DHB elections to be held this October, these questions are very timely.</p>
<p>&quot;Dame Susan&#39;s comments - as she announces her retirement from Auckland DHB - are similar to those of Canterbury DHB member Erin Baker, who last year questioned the role of Board members,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;Both say the real power lies with Health Minister Annette King and the Health Ministry. While voters are told they are electing people onto DHBs to represent their interests locally, the reality is that members are actually elected to implement Government policy.</p>
<p>&quot;This is Ms King&#39;s central control in the guise of regional responsibility. Labour has already changed the way DHB members are elected, by rushing through the STV At-Large voting system - with only cursory consultation - and abolishing local ward representation.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, only `stars&#39; like Erin Baker and Susan Devoy will be elected. Local people with good skills, but who are not well-known regionally, will find it almost impossible to be elected - it doesn&#39;t really matter though; this arrogant Government is committed to central control, and this is just the way Labour likes it,&quot; Mrs Roy said.  </p>
