<p><strong>Friday, 13 February 2004, 9:59 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Proportion of huge student debts growing</p>
<p>The latest student loan scheme report released by the Inland Revenue Department shows that the proportion of student loan borrowers is increasing, with over 500 extra borrowers having loans over $40,000 since the last quarterly report.</p>
<p>&quot;Student debt has more than doubled under the Labour government and the big scary loans of many thousands are not going away&quot; said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association. &quot;As living costs make up a bigger proportion of bigger student loans, it&#39;s clear that borrowing for rent and food is forcing students into multi thousand dollar debts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Students could avoid getting into such large debts if government deliver on their promise to increase access to living allowances,&quot; said Fitzsimons. &quot;A living allowance for all students is the best way to get massive student debts under control.&quot;</p>
<p>The student loan scheme quarterly report shows that recent changes to the loans scheme have not fixed New Zealand&#39;s huge student loan problem.</p>
<p>&quot;Debt is set to grow even more this year when Labour&#39;s fee rises kick in. With big fee rises in many areas, expect to watch the big debts balloon and the problems associated with debt get even worse.&quot;  </p>
