<p>MECA Settled at last!</p>
<p>At meetings across the country this week, members of the Association of Staff in Tertiary Education (ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa) from six Polytechnics and Institutes of Technology, voted overwhelmingly in favour of ratifying a multi-employer collective agreement that will cover all their sites.</p>
<p>ASTE National President, Lloyd Woods said today, “This is a major achievement for ASTE and all of our members who have participated in what has been a long drawn out process. We are all very pleased with the outcome as it proves that it is possible and beneficial to negotiate common conditions across a number of employers”</p>
<p>He went on to say that despite the fact that the process had taken 23 days of face to face negotiations, significant strike action and mediation to reach a satisfactory outcome, members believed it was worthwhile. “We are part of a national teaching service and our conditions of work and rates of pay should be negotiated in a way that reflects this”, Lloyd Woods said</p>
<p>He added that he hoped the Employment Relations Act would be amended to ensure that multi-employer bargaining becomes the norm rather than something workers have to fight for before they can even begin talking about what will be in their collective agreements.</p>
<p>ASTE believes that these employers having gone through this process will now see the benefits of a collective approach.</p>
