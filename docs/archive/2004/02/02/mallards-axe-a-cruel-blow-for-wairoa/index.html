<p>Mallard&#39;s Axe, A Cruel Blow For Wairoa</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman and buddy MP for Wairoa Deborah Coddington today accused Education Minister Trevor Mallard of waging a bitter war upon rural communities, following his announcement that nine Wairoa schools will effectively be closed.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister&#39;s decision is a cruel blow for Wairoa. Schools are an integral part of what brings communities together,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;Turiroa School board chairman Ken King is right to call Mr Mallard&#39;s attempts to consult with the Wairoa community `little more than a PR exercise&#39;. The Minister has ridden roughshod over the wishes of parents, students and teachers - and closed their schools.</p>
<p>&quot;East Coast MP Janet Mackey and Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia have failed to stand up for the community they purport to represent. Sadly, Labour MPs have a nasty habit of representing their caucus&#39;s decisions to the electorate, rather than vice versa.</p>
<p>&quot;Last night&#39;s decision will bring dire consequences. Teachers will be forced to reapply for their jobs, children will have their education disrupted, and schools will inevitably lose some of their community support.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT accepts that schools will, from time-to-time, close or merge. But that decision must be made by the communities affected - not by a Minister whose prime motivation is to save money,&quot; Miss Coddington said.  </p>
