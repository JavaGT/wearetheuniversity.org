<p><strong>Friday, 20 February 2004, 2:04 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Victoria University defends its graduates</p>
<p>Victoria University graduates, regardless of ethnicity, gender, age or any other demographic characteristic, have all been awarded their qualifications because of their ability to succeed in their chosen programme of study. “Victoria University of Wellington utterly refutes any suggestion that its Mâori alumni have not met the standard required to graduate,” said Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stuart McCutcheon.</p>
<p>“All students must meet the standard set within each individual course that, collectively, enables the qualification to be awarded.” “All our alumni have earned their qualifications by meeting the same rigorous standards.</p>
<p>“Universities undergo comprehensive quality assurance procedures at individual course, programme and institution-wide levels. This includes international and national benchmarking and expertise to ensure that standards are applied at the appropriate level. Victoria University of Wellington does not apply standards to students on any basis other than performance in required coursework.</p>
<p>“All students must meet entrance requirements in order to enrol. We do recognise that students have different levels of preparation for university study and we provide a range of study assistance, mentoring, disability support, scholarships, pastoral care for international students, and other forms of support to enable students to succeed and achieve their true potential.”  </p>
