<p>Brash welcomes foreshore support</p>
<p>National Party leader Don Brash has welcomed the results of a study by Massey University showing that more than half of Maori support Crown ownership of the beaches, foreshore and seabed.</p>
<p>The poll of 1000 people by Massey University found that 57% of Maori, and 88% of non-Maori said they wanted the Crown to retain title to the foreshore and seabed, protecting access rights for all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders do not want separate titles and development rights for our beaches according to race, as Labour wants,&quot; said Dr Brash.</p>
<p>The survey also found that amongst Maori 78% agree the same laws should apply to all New Zealanders, and 61% support a firm time limit for resolving land claims.</p>
<p>&quot;This is consistent with all the feedback I&#39;ve had since my speech in Orewa. The fact that over half of Maori surveyed support National&#39;s position on the foreshore and seabed is yet another wakeup call for the Government.</p>
<p>&quot;This poll shows the Government has been listening to extremist groups rather than mainstream Maori. They have been captured by a radical fringe, rather than acting in the interests of all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;It is another illustration of how completely out of touch Labour is with ordinary New Zealanders, both Maori and non-Maori,&quot; said Dr Brash.</p>
