<p>Medical Staff Honoured For Teaching Excellence</p>
<p>Years of teaching excellence and clinical expertise have been recognised at the annual Academic Inauguration at the Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Otago.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Philip Bagshaw (Surgery), Dr Peter Moller (Rheumatology/Musculoskeletal Medicine) and Dr Philip Parkin (Neurology) received Teaching Gold Medals for their outstanding contributions to the life of the School over many years.</p>
<p>The Gold Medals were presented by Assistant Vice Chancellor Health Sciences, Linda Holloway, in the Rolleston Lecture Theatre, following the inauguration address by Vice Chancellor, Dr Graeme Fogelberg, and presentation of prizes for the 2003 academic year.</p>
<p>All three staff are well known for their longstanding enthusiasm for teaching, modesty regarding their achievements, and for the several awards they have each received from students as ‘best teachers’. Professor Bagshaw has lectured in surgery for over 20 years, Dr Moller has taught Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Medicine since arriving at the School in 1973, and Dr Parkin has taught Neurology for the last 15 years.</p>
<p>“Quality clinical teaching at the bedside is the cornerstone of excellence in medical education, and we are delighted to honour these three staff,” said the Dean Professor Ian Town.</p>
<p>Dr Peter Moller will retire from staff in April after over three decades lecturing at the School. He has been involved in a wide range of professional and educational initiatives in that time, including the introductory clinical course for 4th year students, the first Pharmacology course, serving on the editorial board of the NZMJ and Chairman of the Christchurch Medical Staff Association. He also received the NZ Order of Merit in 1996.  </p>
