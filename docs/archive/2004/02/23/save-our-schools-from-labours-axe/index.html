<p>Save Our Schools From Labour&#39;s Axe</p>
<p>Monday 23 Feb 2004<br>Deborah Coddington<br>Press Releases -- Education -- Save Our Schools</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today urged New Zealanders to voice their anger over Labour&#39;s school closures and said that, with the Government&#39;s popularity in free-fall, the time was ripe to save their children&#39;s futures.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s popularity is sinking like a stone - there has never been a more opportune time for Kiwis to stand up and protect one of their most fundamental rights - a parent&#39;s right to choose a quality education and a decent future for their children, Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;If enough of us take action, Labour may attempt to improve its woeful polling and reflect on its misguided decision to close over 300 schools in the next seven years. Education Minister Trevor Mallard could well reverse some, or all, of the 71 recently-announced closures.</p>
<p>&quot;It is time to stand up and be counted. I am calling on parents, teachers and students - anyone who is concerned about the quality of education in this country - to turn out en masse and force this beleaguered Government to revisit its decision to close hundreds of schools.</p>
<p>&quot;Tomorrow&#39;s march is a rare chance for local communities to stand up and fight for the future of their schools - and their children.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT will fight Mr Mallard&#39;s vicious school closures at every turn, and urges others to do the same. The Government has never been weaker. Its time to take action - for the sake of our children,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
