<p>INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS TO DELIVER FREE PUBLIC BIOTECHNOLOGY LECTURES</p>
<p>The public are invited to attend free lectures by New Zealand and international experts on biotechnology and bioentrepreneurship at The University of Auckland, beginning next week.</p>
<p>The public lectures are part of the &quot;Commercialising Biotechnology for Financial Success&quot; summer course, run by the University in conjunction with NZ Trade &amp; Enterprise (NZTE).</p>

In addition, it aims to provide people from a scientific background with a basic understanding of business principles, and to provide businesspeople with an understanding of the science that underpins emerging biobusiness ventures.</p>
<p>Each of the six evening sessions, spread over three weeks from January 20 to February 5, includes a free public lecture, half an hour of networking, and a tutorial for enrolled participants. The venue is the Old Government House Lecture Theatre, 3A Symonds Street, Auckland.</p>
