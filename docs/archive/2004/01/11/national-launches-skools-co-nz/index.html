<p><strong>Sunday, 11 January 2004, 11:56 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National launches SKOOLS.co.nz</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English is today launching a new web site aimed at helping communities that face the prospect of losing their local school under Labour’s network review.</p>
<p>“If Trevor Mallard was listening to communities around New Zealand they’d be telling him to ‘Stop Killing Off Our Local Schools’ (SKOOLS).</p>
<p>“It’s hoped the <a href="http://www.SKOOLS.co.nz">http://www.SKOOLS.co.nz</a> web site will become a useful resource for parents, teachers and students who want to know more about the network reviews, which threaten to close up to 300 schools.</p>
<p>“National shares community concerns about the impacts of school closures on smaller centres.</p>
<p>“We also question a process that forces good schools to close while allowing failing schools to remain open, and in some cases, expand.</p>
<p>“These communities have everything to fear because the Government has not been listening to them.</p>
<p>“The decisions are being made in Wellington, with little regard being given to the social consequences, not to mention educational outcomes.</p>
<p>“National believes parents and communities know what’s best for their children, they should be making the decisions - not the Minister from his ivory tower in Wellington,” says Mr English.</p>
<p>SKOOLS.co.nz is the latest in a series of successful web sites from the National Party, which has also been behind internet campaigns on the Qantas/Air New Zealand merger, the foreshore and seabed debate as well as the flatulence tax and leaky buildings crisis.</p>
