<p>New research shows debt nightmare for school leavers</p>
<p>Two thirds of 2003 school leavers are concerned about student debts before they even undertake tertiary study, according to new research released today by the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>The costs of study, including fee levels and living costs, were a major influence on the school leavers decisions about whether to undertake tertiary study, and what or where to study.</p>
<p>&quot;This research shows that costs are a huge worry for young people about to undertake tertiary study,&quot; said Fleur Fitzsimons, NZUSA Co-President. &quot;It also shows that student debt and high fees are especially unfair for Pasifika students and those from poorer schools.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s hard enough to make big decisions about where to live and what to study, without the added burden of thousands of dollars of debt,&quot; said Fitzsimons. &quot;The Labour Government&#39;s continuing love affair with the unfair loans scheme is placing huge pressure on school leavers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Government sanctioned fee rises under the fee maxima system will make fees and loans even larger for this group of young people,&quot; said Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government need to show their commitment to young people contemplating entering tertiary education in 2004 by reducing fees and introducing a living allowance for all students,&quot; said Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>Nearly six hundred seventh formers from fifteen schools throughout the country participated in the survey.  </p>
