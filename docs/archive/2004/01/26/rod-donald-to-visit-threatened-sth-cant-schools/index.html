<p>Media Advisory<br>Rod Donald to visit threatened Sth Canterbury schools</p>
<p>Green Party Co-leader Rod Donald will visit six schools in South Canterbury tomorrow (Tuesday, January 27) that Education Minister Trevor Mallard is threatening to close.</p>
<p>The schools include:</p>
<p>Salisbury Primary, South of Timaru.<br>Watlington Intermediate, Timaru<br>Marchwiel Primary, Timaru<br>Pleasant Point High School<br>Timuka Primary School<br>Woodbury Primary School, near Geraldine</p>
<p>&quot;The Green Party is very sceptical of Mr Mallard&#39;s motives for closing down rural and provincial schools,&quot; said Mr Donald. &quot;The minister has failed so far to produce a shred of evidence to justify any of the schools he has closed in the face of opposition from the community.</p>
<p>&quot;The reviews are more about saving money so he can spend it in Auckland than improving educational outcomes for children. The closures totally contradict the government&#39;s own regional development policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Before Christmas, Mr Mallard refused to answer my parliamentary question on why he is closing schools in South Canterbury so I&#39;ll visit them myself to find out what&#39;s really going on,&quot; said Mr Donald.</p>
<p>&quot;On behalf of the Green Party I will be offering to support South Canterbury communities in the fight to keep their local schools.&quot;</p>
