<p>Brian Connell<br>National Commerce Spokesperson</p>
<p>26 January 2004</p>
<p>Saddam found, Parker still missing!</p>
<p>&quot;Otago deserves better representation on the Project Aqua debate,&quot; warns Brian Connell, MP for Rakaia and Spokesman for Commerce. &quot;They are being poorly represented by the &#39;Invisible Man&#39; himself, David Parker.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Project Aqua - if it goes ahead - is going to have a huge impact on the Otago and Canterbury regions. Where is the Otago MP when all this is happening? No one knows! Does he support it fully? No one knows!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever there&#39;s a hint of controversy or that his constituents might argue with Labour policy, David goes to ground. Finding Saddam was child&#39;s play compared to locating David when he has to risk offending someone by taking a stand!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When the Resource Management (Waitaki Catchment) Amendment Bill was debated before Christmas, David was out of there faster than a long-tailed cat in a roomful of rocking chairs!</p>
<p>&quot;At last week&#39;s Project Aqua meeting in Oamaru, Pete Hodgson and Marian Hobbs had the courage to front up and debate the issues. As for David - rumour says he was there but that he didn&#39;t dare say anything. Otago deserves an MP who will take a stand, defend it and represent Otago properly.&quot; &quot;As for the Greens, I&#39;m a little cynical about their sudden determination to protect Otago in David&#39;s absence. They couldn&#39;t even be bothered running a candidate there last election, so forgive me for thinking this is cheap political opportunism rather than a genuine concern for the area.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I oppose Project Aqua myself and I&#39;m pleased to see the Greens do too - although I suspect their reasoning is based less on commercial realities than on their normal hostility to commercial developments!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a sad day for Otago when the Greens have a better articulated policy than the local MP! David has to start listening to his constituents and carry their views to Parliament. Whether he supports Aqua or opposes it, he can&#39;t straddle the fence forever!&quot;</p>
