<p><strong>Monday, 26 January 2004, 10:11 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association">New Zealand University Student&#39;s Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Fleur Fitzsimons<br>NZUSA Co-President</p>
<p>Less student debt equals more teachers</p>
<p>Trevor Mallard&#39;s claims that he is on top of the shortage in secondary teachers are unconvincing, say the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>&quot;While some teaching students have been lucky enough to get scholarships, many others are facing ten per cent fee rises this year due to a loophole in the new fee maxima,&quot; said Fleur Fitzsimons, NZUSA Co-President.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn&#39;t wash for government to act concerned about a lack of teachers and allow National Party-size fee increases at Wellington and Dunedin Colleges of Education,&quot; said Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>All four colleges of education raised their fees under the governments new fee maxima policy.</p>
<p>&quot;The governments fee maxima policy has failed teaching students and lead to more student debt and even longer loan repayment times for these students.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear that student debt is wreaking havoc with the New Zealand workforce, if this government was serious about fixing the teaching shortage, they would lower fees and introduce a living allowance for all students&quot; said Fitzsimons.</p>
