<p>New Zealand could fall victim to bird flu</p>
<p>Green MP Sue Kedgley said today that the deadly bird flu virus sweeping through South East Asia should be a warning of the significant health risks of rearing birds in unsustainable, over-crowded and unhygienic conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;While our chicken flock is relatively free of disease, if the bird flu managed to reach New Zealand it could easily sweep through our intensively-reared flocks in the same way as Asia because we also raise chickens in overcrowded conditions,&quot; said Ms Kedgley, the Green Health spokesperson.</p>
<p>&quot;The bird flu can run rampant through chicken factory farms where tens of thousands of birds are cramped into sheds, and New Zealand has many farms like this.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to face up to the fact that intensive poultry farming is unsustainable and poses a health risk and switch to alternative free-range and organic ways of raising poultry.</p>
<p>&quot;To make matters worse, these birds are force-fed antibiotics to help prevent diseases that can sweep through factory farms. Already, 50 per cent of some chicken flocks are contaminated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria that are enormously resilient and hard to eliminate,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley said the latest outbreak of the avian flu demonstrates the foolishness of allowing poultry imports into New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders should take some comfort in the knowledge that, so far, we have wisely resisted allowing the importation of chickens into New Zealand despite considerable pressure in the past.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand would face a huge risk to both our health and to the poultry industry if we were to open the poultry market to international imports. Instead, we should encourage the organic and free-range poultry market that uses sustainable and less-intensive ways of rearing chickens,&quot; said Ms Kedgley.</p>
