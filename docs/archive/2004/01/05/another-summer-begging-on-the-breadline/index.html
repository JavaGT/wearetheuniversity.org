<p>Another summer begging on the breadline</p>
<p>Green MP Nandor Tanczos says the Government has condemned students to yet another summer spent begging on the breadline.</p>
<p>The Green Tertiary Education spokesperson was commenting on reports that the Students&#39; Association of the Waikato Institute of Technology had opened a foodbank to feed students unable to find work and ineligible to receive Work and Income assistance over the summer.</p>
<p>Nandor said foodbanks have become a regular feature of university life since the National Government scrapped the Emergency Unemployment Benefit (EUB) in 1998.</p>
<p>Despite then-opposition Tertiary Education spokesperson Steve Maharey saying it was &quot;mean-spirited attack on students&quot; and promising to repeal the decision in 1998, Mr Maharey said in the last session of parliament before the summer recess that &quot;the Unemployment Benefit Student Hardship was the emergency unemployment benefit, in practice.&quot;</p>
<p>Nandor said that clearly Mr Maharey had forgotten to liase with StudyLink and Work and Income, who were denying students access on the basis of the 1998 decision. &quot;Unless there is regulatory or legislative change, Mr Maharey&#39;s words will be meaningless.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The student support system is awash with inequities. Student allowance payments are less than the unemployment benefit, and parental income-testing applies. These are some of the flaws that make it financially more attractive to be unemployed than to seek an education,&quot; said Nandor.</p>
<p>Nandor said he had been made aware of a number of students who enrolled in university summer courses, not intending to complete or even attend them, just to qualify for the living component of the student loans scheme. &quot;Their debt grows and their academic record is tarnished, just because the Government wants to keep sitting on its record surplus, like a old hen camping out on an unfertilised egg.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Government wants to grow a better society, it needs to stop being miserly and invest in people,&quot; said Nandor. &quot;Students would be a good place to start.&quot;  </p>
