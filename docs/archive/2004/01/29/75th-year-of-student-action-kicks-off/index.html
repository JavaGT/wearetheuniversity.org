<p>75th year of student action kicks off in Wellington</p>
<p>The seventy fifth year of student action in New Zealand kicks off with the New Zealand University Students&#39; Association (NZUSA) Conference in Wellington this week.</p>
<p>&quot;NZUSA was formed in 1929 and we intend to recognise great student campaigns and activists through the years, &quot; said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of NZUSA. &quot;Over the last seventy five years students have had a huge impact on the politics and culture of this country, and NZUSA has been instrumental in this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This conference will begin the celebration of the history of our organisation,&quot; said Fitzsimons. &quot;We&#39;ll also be looking forward planning campaigns and actions for 2004 to put real pressure on the Government to deliver on their promises to increase access to student allowances.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ve been waiting too long for Labour to deliver meaningful change to the unpopular loans scheme,&quot; said Amanda Hill, Conference Spokesperson and President of the Victoria University Students Association. &quot;Our claim to the Human Rights Commission is a ground-breaking challenge to these unfair policies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ll also be carrying on the proud student tradition of taking to the streets to fight for students. A living allowance for all students is top of our list of demands and we have the full support of the New Zealand public,&quot; said Hill.</p>
<p>A student cardboard city will be created at Parliament Grounds at 4 pm Friday to draw attention to the plight of the two thirds of tertiary students who are not entitled to an unemployment benefit if they can&#39;t find work over summer.  </p>
