<p>School Closures: Christchurch Next?</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today urged Christchurch principals, boards of trustees, teachers, parents and students to fight any attempts by the Labour Government to implement a round of network reviews in the area - a precursor to school closures.</p>
<p>&quot;Education Ministry officials recently met with representatives from schools within the Christchurch area to discuss the schools&#39; future structure. The Ministry has denied a review is imminent, but schools have reason to fear such an outcome,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;Education Minister Trevor Mallard has shown an insatiable appetite for closing schools - he plans to close over 300 in the next seven years. Despite Education Ministry denials, a review of Christchurch schools appears inevitable.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry is currently reviewing the future of 168 New Zealand schools. It begs the question: where are the remaining schools going to come from? A safe bet would be on Christchurch.</p>
<p>&quot;Christchurch people should remain vigilant for Mr Mallard&#39;s creeping school closures. Communities must stand firm against this Labour Government&#39;s misguided culling of schools. If they don&#39;t, schools will simply vanish, never to return,&quot; Miss Coddington said.  </p>
