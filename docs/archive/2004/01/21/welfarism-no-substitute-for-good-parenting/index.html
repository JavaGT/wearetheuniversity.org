<p>Welfarism No Substitute For Good Parenting</p>
<p>New Zealand First is calling on the Government to make reducing welfarism a priority for 2004.</p>
<p>“Whilst there must be an umbrella to meet genuine and deserving need, welfare policy cannot continue neglecting to assist beneficiaries becoming independent of the state,” said social services spokesperson, Bill Gudgeon.</p>
<p>“Our welfare system has itself become a sickness that degrades people and denies the opportunity to develop individual and collective talents and potential.</p>
<p>”This Labour-led administration and its 300 social policy analysts continue to fail to understand that its policies of dependency are further impoverishing both the recipients of benefits and the country as a whole.</p>
<p>“Most of the 400,000 beneficiaries would choose opportunity over a benefit any day. The dole encourages people to be neither progressive nor ambitious. The system undermines personal responsibility and denies dignity,” said Mr Gudgeon.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First challenges the Government to provide the educational and employment opportunities to allow New Zealanders to be independent of mother state.</p>
<p>“We also challenge the Government to ensure families take greater responsibility for the deeds of their children and to ensure that good parenting skills are taught to all our students,” said Mr Gudgeon.</p>
