<p>&#39;Drugged driver&#39; study meaningless and risky</p>
<p>Green MP Nandor Tanczos said today that plans by police to trial driver drug-testing were both ill-conceived and unworkable.</p>
<p>The Waikato Times reported this afternoon that police will commence a trial by June to test drivers for drugs at checkpoints in regions where they consider a problem exists of people driving under the influence of drugs. People identified as driving under the influence of drugs would be charged.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greens support driver impairment testing for alcohol and other drugs such as cannabis,&quot; said Nandor, the Green spokesperson for Drug Policy. &quot;However, the police obviously haven&#39;t thought this issue through well enough.</p>
<p>&quot;Any result of the study would be meaningless as police don&#39;t currently have the technology to test whether a driver is impaired by cannabis.</p>
<p>&quot;Superintendent Steve Fitzgerald admitted police have little evidence that this problem actually exists in New Zealand and was relying on anecdotal information - yet they&#39;re prepared to go ahead with trials even though their method of testing will be totally subjective and will be hard to prove in court.</p>
<p>&quot;The police haven&#39;t even worked out what threshold should be set to determine if a driver was &#39;incapable of having proper control&#39;, as the traffic law states.</p>
<p>&quot;Drug tests currently available can only prove if someone has used cannabis at some point in the past, and there is nothing to indicate if a driver was actually impaired at the time they were stopped.&quot;</p>
<p>Nandor said he supported keeping impaired drivers off the road but would resist any attempts by the police to use the trial to charge people with other cannabis offences.</p>
<p>&quot;I will be seeking an assurance from the Minister of Police that they will not be using this trial to conduct &#39;fishing expeditions&#39; for cannabis possession,&quot; said Nandor.</p>
