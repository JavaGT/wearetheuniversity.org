<p><strong>Tuesday, 20 January 2004, 10:15 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Dr Lynda Scott MP<br>National Party Health Spokeswoman</p>

<p>New bid to hide health policy failures</p>
<p>National Party Health spokeswoman Lynda Scott is concerned that serious illness may go undiagnosed because of the latest bid to hide the Government&#39;s failing health policies.</p>
<p>She&#39;s responding to reports that the Auckland District Health Board plans to reduce the waiting times for hundreds of ear, nose and throat patients by referring them back to their GPs.</p>
<p>&quot;The simple fact is that these patients were referred to the specialist because their GP has real concerns about their condition.</p>
<p>&quot;The problems are not always life threatening, but often they can have a dramatic impact on a person&#39;s quality of life,&quot; says Dr Scott.</p>
<p>&quot;But instead of being dealt with, by the appropriate health professional, those who&#39;ve already faced long waits are being sent back to their GP.</p>
<p>&quot;In many cases this policy will simply delay the inevitable.</p>
<p>&quot;This will come at tremendous cost to the patient, who will have to pay again to visit their GP. Many are already faced with time off school or work.</p>
<p>&quot;Children will lose their hearing and the elderly will remain deaf under this plan,&quot; says Dr Scott.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s yet another ploy to hide health policy failures, similar to the Government move to dump thousands of people from the surgical waiting list.</p>
<p>&quot;Those who can&#39;t afford private treatment continue to suffer - it&#39;s hardly first world healthcare,&quot; says Dr Scott.</p>
