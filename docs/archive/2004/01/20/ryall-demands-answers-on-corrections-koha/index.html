<p>Hon Tony Ryall MP National Party Corrections Spokesman</p>

<p>Ryall Demands Answers On Corrections Koha</p>
<p>National Party Corrections spokesman Tony Ryall is calling for a full accounting of the $417, 652 spent by the Corrections Department on &#39;koha&#39; in the past five years.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m demanding a full detailed explanation about where that money has gone.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;d be particularly interested to find out how much of that &#39;koha&#39; was given away during the Department&#39;s consultation process with Maori over the regional prisons programme.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;d be just as keen to see what the Department got for it,&quot; he says. &quot;This money is on top of the hundreds of thousands of dollars paid out for &#39;cultural advice&#39; on RMA applications.</p>
<p>Figures released today show that Corrections made up a third of the total &#39;koha&#39; payments in the past five years, peaking under Labour in the 2002/03 year.</p>
<p>&quot;National is concerned that these cheques are being handed out with little or no accountability.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the taxpayer deserves to know what return they&#39;re getting on their investment, especially when the funding is coming from tight budgets like those within Corrections,&quot; Mr Ryall says.</p>
