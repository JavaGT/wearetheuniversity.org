<p>Schools Close, Despite Excellent ERO Reports</p>
<p>Wednesday 28 Jan 2004<br>Deborah Coddington<br>Press Releases -- Education</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today slammed Education Minister Trevor Mallard&#39;s decision to close five Upper Hutt and Stokes Valley schools, describing the latest round of closures a disgrace.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard&#39;s decision - announced last night - is disgraceful. Without exception, these schools have recently received excellent Education Review Office reports - not that it makes one iota of difference to this cold-hearted Minister,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;The closure of these academically successful schools - at the same time that failing schools remain open - doesn&#39;t make any sense. The communities served by these schools have every right to feel angry.</p>
<p>&quot;Cost cutting appears to be the only explanation for this recent cull. The wishes of parents, students, teachers and boards of trustees don&#39;t seem to factor into the Minister&#39;s equation.</p>
<p>&quot;By sucking money from provincial New Zealand, to pour into new Auckland schools, Mr Mallard is robbing Peter to pay Paul - and leaving Peter with fewer options for his children&#39;s education.</p>
<p>&quot;What is truly frightening is that these closures are merely the tip of the iceberg - Labour plans to close over 300 schools in the next seven years. Sanity must prevail - the Minister should end the network review process before it&#39;s too late, and decent schools vanish forever&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
