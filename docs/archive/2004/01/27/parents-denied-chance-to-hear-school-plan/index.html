<p><strong>Tuesday, 27 January 2004, 12:37 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Bill English MP National Party Education Spokesman</p>
<p>27 January 2004</p>
<p>Parents denied chance to hear school plan</p>
<p>National Party Education spokesman Bill English is appalled that the Government is poised to deny parents the opportunity to hear about the future of their school first hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard is running scared over school closures.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr English is commenting ahead of meetings scheduled in Upper Hutt tonight, including one in Stokes Valley, which is closed to parents unless they&#39;re on the board.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard knows that anger is growing, and that&#39;s why he&#39;s shutting the community out of these meetings.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is about to announce large scale school closures in Upper Hutt, Stokes Valley, Timaru and Invercargill.</p>
<p>&quot;These closures will affect thousands of families, but the Minister is refusing to deal with them face to face,&quot; Mr English says.</p>
<p>&quot;Where emotions are running high, in places like Invercargill and Stokes Valley, the meetings have been closed. In Upper Hutt, where there has been less of a fuss, the meeting is open.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister is losing his nerve. Parents should be encouraged by the fact that he is unable to face them because of the pressure they have put on the Government.</p>
<p>&quot;These closures will leave long lasting scars because they have been forced on communities and because they have no educational benefit.</p>
<p>&quot;The minister has lost his appetite for angry parents, and that&#39;s a sign they should keep at it with letters petitions and demonstrations,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
