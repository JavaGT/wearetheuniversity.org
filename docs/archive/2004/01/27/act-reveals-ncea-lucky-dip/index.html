<p>ACT Reveals NCEA Lucky Dip</p>
<p>Tuesday 27 Jan 2004 Deborah Coddington Press Releases -- Education</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today exposed the flaws in the New Zealand Qualifications Authority&#39;s delivery of NCEA results by revealing that one student inadvertently received the exam papers of two other students.</p>
<p>&quot;Commonsense tell us that this would not be an isolated case. Recent reports have highlighted a myriad of problems associated with the release of NCEA results,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been reports of students spending hours trying to access the NZQA website to see their results; teachers and students unable to finalise classes and timetables due to late results; and parents and employers scratching their heads over the new grading system.</p>
<p>&quot;Education Minister Trevor Mallard is responsible for this mess. He rushed through the NCEA with nowhere near enough planning and now it&#39;s students, parents, and teachers who are forced to pick up the pieces.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard cannot guarantee students will receive the marks they have earned - yet that&#39;s the most basic, fundamental requirement you&#39;d expect after spending the year trying to achieve the best possible results.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT is the only party that has consistently opposed the NCEA from day one. ACT is the voice of parents and students who didn&#39;t want this new qualification, and we opposed its shoddy and substandard implementation.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s time to give our schools the choice of dumping the NCEA, and adopting internationally-recognised external exams. It&#39;s also time Mr Mallard sorted himself out, and start acting like a competent Education Minister for once,&quot; Miss Coddington said.</p>
