<p>Official papers confirm Labour is failing Maori</p>
<p>National Party Maori Affairs spokeswoman Georgina te Heuheu says a leaked report out today confirms the Labour Government is failing Maori. &quot;Despite all the talk and all the poorly focussed hand-outs - Maori are still falling behind in key areas.&quot;</p>
<p>Reports today say the leaked Social Development Ministry papers show - among other things - that the gap between Maori and Pakeha life expectancy is growing. The report also highlights growing gaps in early childhood education and university degree status.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is pouring millions of dollars into so-called &#39;Capacity Building&#39;, so where are the results?</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s nothing here for the Government to celebrate.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of the successes came from areas beyond its reach or initiatives put in place before Labour&#39;s time.</p>
<p>&quot;Maori employment for example, has been helped along by a buoyant world economy and high commodity prices.</p>
<p>&quot;And while the Government crows about the numbers now engaged in gaining tertiary qualifications, there&#39;s a question mark hanging over the economic value of some courses.</p>
<p>&quot;Four years ago this week Helen Clark launched &#39;Closing the Gaps&#39; amid much fanfare. The name has changed but the programme continues to this day.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is that this Government&#39;s agenda is failing. It&#39;s generating resentment and suspicion.</p>
<p>&quot;With these results as a back-drop, Helen Clark like so many Maori, has nothing to celebrate this Waitangi Day,&quot; says Mrs te Heuheu.</p>
