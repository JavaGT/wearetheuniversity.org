<p><strong>Monday, 14 June 2004, 11:17 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Govt lets tertiary institute off the hook - again</p>
<p>&quot;The country&#39;s largest tertiary institution Te Wananga o Aotearoa has failed its second performance audit yet the Minister is refusing to take more than just remedial action,&quot; says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>Papers released to Mr English show Te Wananga o Aotearoa did not meet 16 requirements in a performance audit - including failing to provide enough seats and tables for students in one class.</p>
<p>The wananga, which was established in 1993, has more than 20,000 equivalent full-time students and teaches to degree level.</p>
<p>The audit, carried out between July and September 2003, looked at the head office operation in Te Awamutu, six campuses and two outposts.</p>
<p>It showed the university failed to meet 16 quality requirements, including:</p>
<p>* Not demonstrating quality management systems were in place.</p>
<p>* Lack of document control.</p>
<p>* Not demonstrating it had appraised staff performances.</p>
<p>* Resources not available for students before the delivery of training.</p>
<p>The audit says some students were completing a third of an 18-week course without resources while a July intake of the Applied Social Services programme had no classrooms allocated, insufficient tables and chairs and no access to computers for the completion of assignments.</p>
<p>In 2001, the wananga also failed an audit by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority on 32 counts.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has not been taking quality at the wananga seriously. It should be restraining the growth or stopping it growing until it meets all quality standards.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been allowed to drift along for a couple of years without proper monitoring. Students are paying and not getting what they should.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister should be forced to personally answer to all of those students if, at the next audit later this year, the wananga fails to show a significant improvement,&quot; says Mr English.  </p>
