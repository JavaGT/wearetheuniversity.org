<p>Association of University Staff - Media Release<br>Thursday, 24 June 2004</p>
<p>Academic journal launched</p>
<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) has launched an electronic journal, The New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy - Nga matauranga hikohiko o Aotearoa, which is intended to provide a forum within which issues concerning tertiary education in Aotearoa/New Zealand can be identified, discussed and debated.</p>
<p>The journal&#39;s Executive Editor, Neville Blampied, says that since &quot;Learning for Life&quot;, in 1989, tertiary education in New Zealand has experienced fifteen years of constant re-examination and review - the Green paper, the White paper, the four reports of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission - as well as many other policies and proposals.</p>
<p>&quot;Shifts in policies have had major effects on students, on staff and on the character and operations of tertiary education institutions themselves, sometimes for the better, often for the worse,&quot; said Mr Blampied. &quot;Policy development and implementation have run well ahead of analysis, critique and evaluation.&quot;</p>
<p>AUS has supported the development of the new journal because it is committed to improving and sustaining a quality higher education sector for New Zealand, and because part of its mission is to help formulate policy and assist union members in their role as critic and conscience of society.</p>
<p>The first issue of the Journal features articles by former AUS National President, Dr Grant Duncan, The Tertiary Education Strategy and the will to know, and an investigation of university research by Auckland University of Technology academic, Keith Rankin, entitled Where Gift and Market Economics Meet.</p>

<p>The next issue will be published in the last quarter of 2004, and is planned to have a focus on the Performance-Based Research Fund and its future implications and effects.</p>
