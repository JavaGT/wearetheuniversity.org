<p><strong>Friday, 25 June 2004, 11:18 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Auckland_Business_School">University of Auckland Business School</a></strong></p>
<p>Douglas Myers Support Lifts Business School Past $25 Million Target</p>
<p>A million dollar donation from Douglas Myers has taken the University of Auckland Business School past its initial fundraising target of $25 million for its world-class business school project.</p>
<p>The Government has agreed to match donations from the private sector dollar-for-dollar up to $25 million under its Partnerships for Excellence programme. The donation from Mr Myers - one of New Zealand&#39;s most successful businessmen - means the Business School expects to have drawn down the full amount from the Government within a few weeks.</p>
<p>The Business School is seeking to raise a further $25 million from the private sector.</p>
<p>Explaining his reasons for the donation, Mr Myers paid tribute to University of Auckland Vice-Chancellor Dr John Hood.</p>
<p>&quot;John has brought high aspirations to The University of Auckland. New Zealand&#39;s biggest university in its major city should have a well funded business school that can develop young New Zealanders to be able to compete to global standards. To maintain New Zealand&#39;s high living standards New Zealand must train and retain world class businesspeople.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Hood says it is fitting that Mr Myers&#39; donation has taken the Business School past the $25 million mark.</p>
<p>&quot;Douglas Myers was one of the original group of leading Auckland businessmen who challenged the University several years ago to lift the standard of New Zealand business education, prompting the world-class business school project.</p>

<p>&quot;He has long been an effective champion for quality business education, as evidenced by this most generous support.&quot;</p>
<p>Dean of the Business School, Professor Barry Spicer, says the Business School shares Mr Myers&#39; vision for high quality business education.</p>
<p>&quot;We are delighted to receive this support from one of New Zealand&#39;s most successful businessmen and entrepreneurs. His support will help ensure the next generation of business leaders contribute fully to the nation&#39;s economic future.&quot;</p>
<p>The Business School embarked on its project in 2001, aiming to transform itself from a leading Australasian institution into a truly world class centre, excelling in the basic disciplines of business and economics, and providing leadership to meet the challenges of New Zealand&#39;s enterprise creation and growth.</p>
<p>The funds raised will be spent on programmes and staff, and a new building scheduled for completion in 2007, although parts of the facility will be available for student and staff use before then.  </p>
