<p>A Lifetime In Politics: The Memoirs of Warren Freer</p>
<p>VUP are delighted to publish A Lifetime In Politics: The Memoirs of Warren Freer.</p>
<p>A Lifetime in Politics will be launched at Parliament on Tuesday 29 June 2004 by the Prime Minister (who inherited Freer&#39;s Mt Albert safe Labour seat in 1981).</p>
<p>It&#39;s a very personal account of the changing life in Parliament in NZ 1940-81 and this is written very much in his own voice: conversational and chatty. It&#39;s also a direct, personal account of the Fraser &amp; Kirk Governments and offers frank comment on the Lange, Douglas government.</p>
<p>In 1955 Warren Freer spent five months travelling in Asia, and was the first western politician to visit communist China - against the instructions of Labour leader Nash, but with the blessing of National prime minister Holland. This experience led to a life-long passion for Asia, which he visited many times, and a strong commitment to working for New Zealand&#39;s foreign trade interests.</p>
<p>Warren Freer was close to Norman Kirk and Minister of Trade and Industries in his cabinet. He writes in gripping detail about the Labour Party&#39;s rise to electoral success under Kirk, the innovations of his government, and his tragic early death in office.</p>
<p>A Lifetime in Politics: The Memoirs of Warren Freer gives a personal insight into politics of his era in a way that no other book has done. A valuable contribution to New Zealand&#39;s political and social history, it is also an accessible and engaging life story.</p>
