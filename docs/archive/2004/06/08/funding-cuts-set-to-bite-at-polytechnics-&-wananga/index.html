<p>Funding cuts set to bite at polytechnics and wananga</p>
<p>Polytechnics and wananga should be preparing for significant reductions in government funding, says National&#39;s Education spokesman, Bill English.</p>
<p>Figures obtained by Mr English show that Budget announcements on community education funding will see polytechnics and wananga lose millions of dollars in funding this year.</p>
<p>The Government has cut the community education funding rate by $700 per fulltime student, from $5,700 to $5,000.</p>
<p>Mr English says Education Minister Steve Maharey has finally realised that institutions have been over-funded for running non-assessed, low-cost courses.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister ignored exponential growth until it was too late, and now he has to haul it back.</p>
<p>&quot;Some polytechnics and wananga have used these courses as cash-cows to prop-up less profitable courses.</p>
<p>&quot;Polytechnics and wananga will lose millions if Mr Maharey follows through on his promise to cap community education enrolment numbers.&quot;</p>
<p>Community education enrolments have jumped from 85,000 in 2000 to 461,000 in 2003, with a subsequent jump in funding from $12.6 to $104 million.</p>
<p>&quot;It is unlikely the Government will allow some polytechnics and wananga to spend anything like last year&#39;s levels on community education.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a good opportunity for polytechnics and wananga to get back to basics - providing good quality vocational education the economy so badly needs,&quot; says Mr English.  </p>
