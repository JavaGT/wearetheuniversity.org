<p>School Computer Schemes Unethical – NZ First</p>
<p>Schemes whereby parents are having to pay $500 for their child to receive their schooling in high-tech computer classrooms are unethical, says New Zealand First education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly.</p>
<p>“Fundamental to our education system is the principle of equal opportunity and these schemes undermine that principle.</p>
<p>“How would it be if students were excluded from the school swimming pool unless their parents paid certain capital costs? How would it be if students were excluded from using paints in the classroom because their parents could not afford the school ‘donations’? The public would be outraged. The principle is the same as these computer schemes.</p>
<p>“This government has severely penalised private providers in early childhood and compulsory education because it does not believe the children of the rich should have more than the poor. Yet when state schools create a situation of gross inequity it is doing nothing.</p>
<p>“The Minister must act to prevent this activity or all his other policy positions will be inconsistent and hypocritical,” said Mr Donnelly.</p>
