<p>Margaret Mahy to announce winner of Bell Gully National Schools Poetry Award</p>
<p>Famed children’s writer Margaret Mahy will present this year’s Bell Gully National Schools Poetry Award, to be announced at Victoria University in August 2004.</p>
<p>Any student in Year 12 and 13 enrolled at a New Zealand secondary school is encouraged to submit a poem. Glenn Colquhoun, recent winner of the International Institute of Modern Letter’s (IIML) Prize in Modern Letters, will judge the competition.</p>
<p>The winner will receive a $500 cash prize; a $500 book grant for their school’s library; a year’s membership to the New Zealand Book Council; and subscriptions to leading literary journals Landfall and Sport. Entries for the award close on 18 June 2004.</p>
<p>“A good poem celebrates the possibilities inherent in words, explores the mysteries and paradoxes of language, and as it does this, connects us to the world with a wonderful and almost mathematical certainty,” says Margaret.</p>
<p>“We need young writers to explore and re-explore the world for us, to enlighten us with their imagery and with their jokes too. This poetry award certainly provides them with the encouragement of recognition and I look forward to reading the prize winning poems.”</p>
