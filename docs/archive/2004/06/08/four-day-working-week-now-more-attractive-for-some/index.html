<p>John Key MP National Party Deputy Finance Spokesman</p>
<p>08 June 2004</p>
<p>Four-day working week now more attractive for some</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s narrowly targeted &#39;Working For Families&#39; package will make a four-day working week more attractive for thousands of Kiwis, while the vast majority will miss out,&quot; says National Party Deputy Finance spokesman John Key.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s not because these families will be rolling in new-found cash, but because the Government is providing almost no incentive for them to work on the fifth day. It makes a mockery of Labour&#39;s catch-cry that this Budget will &#39;make work pay&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Under the Government&#39;s &#39;Working For Families&#39; package a single income family earning $60,000 with two kids living in a Wellington suburb is only about $2,000 better off than an equivalent family earning $38,000.</p>
<p>&quot;If both families are paying off a student loan, the family earning $60,000 is less than $200 a year better off.</p>
<p>&quot;That means if you&#39;re earning between $25 and $30 an hour and those conditions apply, you can cut back to a four-day a week and lose almost nothing because of Government top-ups.</p>
<p>&quot;In other words, a hard-working mum or dad earning $25-$30 an hour has little financial reason to work more than four days a week,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
<p>&quot;While some working parents may want to spend more time at home, Labour&#39;s policies will do nothing to help them get ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government is forcing more middle income families to turn to the state for assistance.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is penalising too many New Zealanders with a narrow package that benefits only one in five households.</p>
<p>&quot;While a few will benefit, there&#39;ll be plenty of losers.</p>
<p>&quot;But the real loser will be our economy. At a time when we should be encouraging more people into the workforce. Labour&#39;s making it easier, and indeed financially viable, for more of them to stay at home,&quot; says Mr Key.</p>
