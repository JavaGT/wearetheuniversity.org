<p>Bill English National Education Spokesman</p>
<p>9 June 2004</p>
<p>New programme beats feel-good school reports</p>
<p>Bland, feel-good school reports will soon be a thing of the past, says National MP Bill English.</p>
<p>Commenting today on the launch of the Asttle programme, a new assessment tool for schools, Mr English said too many primary school reports say nice things rather than provide useful information about what a child needs to do better.</p>
<p>&quot;As well as the benefits for schools, Asttle can provide all the information a parent might want to help their child. Parents and children will be able to take individualised tests at home, or access, in real time, a child&#39;s progress at school.</p>
<p>&quot;Relentlessly positive school reports hide problems and weaknesses.</p>
<p>&quot;If parents don&#39;t know what skills their child needs to learn, then how can they help?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr English says the programme is another step along the way to breaking down the traditional view in schools that information about education is dangerous.</p>
<p>&quot;Teachers used to be worried that information would be used to criticise them.</p>
<p>&quot;But attitudes are shifting as parents and teachers learn that more information means better learning.</p>
<p>&quot;I support government funding for the development of this tool, and the professional development for teachers to use it to increase a student&#39;s achievement.&quot;</p>
