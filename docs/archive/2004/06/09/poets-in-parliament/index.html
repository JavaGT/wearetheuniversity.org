<p>Media Advisory</p>
<p>Poets in Parliament</p>
<p>Green MP Mike Ward is teaming up with Victoria University&#39;s International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML) to host an event promoting local poetry and art in the workplace.</p>
<p>&quot;Art should be experienced at all levels of life, so the space that a lot of people spend most of their week is an obvious candidate for more culture,&quot; said Mike, the Green Party&#39;s Arts and Culture Spokesperson.</p>
<p>&quot;Offices such as the one hosting this event do have their decorative embellishments, but all workplaces should be enriched by relevant and engaging aesthetics. I dream of a time when art and artists are part and parcel of the lives of all New Zealanders everyday.&quot;</p>
<p>Poems by Airini Beautrais and Morgan Lawrence-Bach have been painted on canvas by Mike and the resulting artworks will be unveiled on the night.</p>
<p>Airini, who graduated in 2004 with a BSc in Ecology and Biodiversity, and Morgan, who will complete a BA Hons in English Literature this year, attended the first Writing the Landscape workshop offered by the IIML at Victoria in 2001.</p>
<p>The IIML is a non-profit literary activist organisation based in the United States of America. Victoria University was chosen to be its New Zealand headquarters and the Institute opened in March 2001. There are a number of co-centres at major universities in the US.</p>
<p>The poets will give a reading of their work and speakers will include Mike and well-known poet and Institute tutor Dinah Hawken.</p>
<p>What: Poets in Parliament. When: 6.00pm - 7.30pm, Wednesday, 16 June. Where: Green Party parliamentary office, 14th Floor, Bowen House, cnr Lambton Quay &amp; Bowen St.</p>
