<p>Nationwide campaign for grandparenting of international student fees launched</p>
<p>Students are today launching a nation-wide campaign for grandparenting of international student fees at all public tertiary institutions in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The international student protest actions at Waikato and Otago Universities this week have sent a strong message to those institutions and the government: international students will not put up with even higher student fees,” said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).</p>
<p>“The government should require all institutions to introduce grandparenting of international student fees to ensure that international students have certainty about the fees they will be required to pay.”</p>
<p>“The national campaign for grandparenting of international student fees will include petitions, letters to institutions and forums on campuses. Further protest action is likely if institutions do not commit to introducing grandparenting of international student fees.”</p>
<p>“International students will be holding a conference at Lincoln University in early August to discuss how the campaign for grandparenting of international student fees can be won,” said Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>Grandparenting refers to the policy of charging a set fee for the duration of an international student’s study for their qualification. It allows international students the ability to budget more accurately for their qualification costs before they make their final decision in regard to where they study.</p>
