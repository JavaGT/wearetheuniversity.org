<p>Hillcrest High Beats Old Rivals In Mooting Final</p>
<p>Hamilton&#39;s Hillcrest High School has beaten arch rivals Tauranga Girls&#39; College in the final of the increasingly popular Waikato University School of Law secondary schools mooting competition.</p>
<p>The event was held last night in the High Court, Bridge St, Hamilton.</p>
<p>Mooting pits teams against each other in debates on points of law, similar to those argued in appeal cases in the courts.</p>
<p>Tauranga Girls&#39; won the final last year but this year Hillcrest came out the victor in debate over a teacher being deregistered after being seen viewing material on the Internet. Laura Hablous from Hillcrest won the best individual mooter award.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven teams contested this year&#39;s competition.</p>
<p>&quot;Mooting provides an interesting introduction to the law and gives students an insight into some of the skills required by lawyers. Our competition also gives secondary teachers a way of introducing students to legal issues,&quot; says the School of Law&#39;s coordinator of competitions Christina ter Haar. &quot;The standard of mooting competence was particularly high this year, perhaps because as the competition matures more schools are taking advantage of the opportunity to moot and gaining in experience.&quot;  </p>
