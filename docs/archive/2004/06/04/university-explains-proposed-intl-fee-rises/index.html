<p>Waikato University explains proposed international fee rises</p>
<p>Waikato University strongly appreciates and supports its international<br>students and has valid reasons for the proposed international fee<br>increases in 2005. The university has to cover costs, says the<br>university&#39;s international director Lynette Muter. The increases are due<br>to be discussed at a university council meeting on Wednesday 9 June.</p>
<p>Ms Muter also stresses that only a small number of students have been<br>affected by high fee increases relating to a government policy change,<br>and that a hardship fund is in place to support students who qualify for<br>assistance. Students applying for hardship would need to have been<br>enrolled at the university prior to 2003. Students enrolled in<br>degree/diploma programmes in 2003 were given a &quot;fee increase holiday&quot;<br>for A semester 2004 as a gesture of goodwill.</p>
<p>Ms Muter explains that from 2002 onwards there have been annual<br>international tuition fee increases to compensate for the higher costs<br>of academic and pastoral support, the government&#39;s introduction of a<br>compulsory levy for export education providers, compliance costs and<br>operational and capital costs incurred as a result of enrolling<br>international students at the university. &quot;The Education Act 1989<br>requires that international fees should cover the costs of specific<br>provision for international students plus any marginal costs applicable<br>where international students occupy places on mainstream courses.&quot;</p>

<p>There has also been a commercial need to bring the university&#39;s fees in<br>line with its New Zealand competitors, given that lower fees can be<br>equated with low quality. The effect on students has been exacerbated by<br>a strong New Zealand dollar over the last two years and the introduction<br>of compulsory travel and medical insurance by government in January<br>2004.</p>
<p>A major factor behind some of the very steep rises quoted for a small<br>number of students has been the introduction of charging on an EFTS<br>(equivalent full-time student) basis rather than on a flat per course<br>tuition fee basis. &quot;Unfortunately the students are comparing individual<br>degree paper costs prior to the change, with a similarly numbered or<br>level paper after the change to credit points, but this is not a fair<br>comparison,&quot; says Ms Muter. &quot;Some students are caught in the changeover<br>because they are already part way through their qualification under the<br>old regulations, and for this reason the Vice-Chancellor set up a<br>hardship fund in 2003.&quot;</p>
<p>To date six students have qualified for assistance under the fund&#39;s<br>criteria out of 16 applications considered by the hardship committee.</p>
<p>&quot;Students in 2005 will still be able to apply to the hardship fund if<br>they qualify for assistance as set out in the letter available from the<br>International Centre Reception,&quot; says Ms Muter.</p>
<p>In respect of Bachelors Degrees and Graduate Diplomas, excluding Waikato<br>Management School programmes, next week&#39;s council meeting will consider<br>an international tuition fee increase of between 3.2% and 6.7%. The fee<br>increase introduced this year, in the B semester, for new students in<br>the Waikato Management School (WMS) is proposed to be extended to all<br>WMS students for 2005. The Language Institute is recommending no change<br>for 2005.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a strong commitment to providing quality education and care to<br>our international students and this is achieved by improving services to<br>them,&quot; says Ms Muter.</p>
