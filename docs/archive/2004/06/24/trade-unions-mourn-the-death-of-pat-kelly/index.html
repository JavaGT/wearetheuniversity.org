<p>Trade Unions Mourn the Death of Pat Kelly</p>
<p>The Labour movement has lost one of its most dedicated and extraordinary characters with the death of Pat Kelly, Council of Trade Unions president Ross Wilson said today.</p>
<p>Pat Kelly, a former official of the Drivers Union, the long-time secretary of the Cleaners Union and president of the Wellington Trades Council during the days of the Federation of Labour, died this afternoon.</p>
<p>“Pat dedicated his working life to fighting for the rights of his fellow workers,” Ross Wilson said. “He was a real character of the trade union movement.”</p>
<p>Alongside his dedication to unions, Mr Kelly was also widely involved in social movements such as opposition to the war in Vietnam, the campaign against apartheid in South Africa, anti-nuclear protests and the peace movement.</p>
<p>Mr Kelly was in Wellington Trades Hall when his best friend and fellow union organiser, Ernie Abbot, was killed there by a bomb 20 years ago. Mr Kelly organised the funeral and led a march through the city in memorial to his friend.</p>
<p>Mr Kelly had been retired for some years but his daughter, Helen, is currently general secretary of the Association of University Staff and vice president of the CTU.</p>
