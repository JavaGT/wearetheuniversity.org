<p><strong>Wednesday, 2 June 2004, 1:41 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Judith Collins MP</p>
<p>National Party Family Spokeswoman</p>
<p>02 June 2004</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time for parents to take back the child discipline debate,&quot; says National Party Family spokeswoman Judith Collins.</p>
<p>&quot;Any sensible person knows that beating their children, or any child for that matter, is unacceptable. But surely the vast majority of parents are still best placed to know what&#39;s right when it comes to disciplining their kids.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems heavy handed for this Government to be considering a law change to target a minority of bad parents, when it will have a profound effect on the majority of good parents.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents have rights too and it&#39;s about time these were recognised,&quot; says Ms Collins.</p>
<p>She is responding to Otago University research that suggests smacking young children causes anti-social behaviour, and impairs academic achievement.</p>
<p>&quot;After putting this issue on the table in the first place, the polls have been telling the Labour Government to put its controversial PC agenda on hold.</p>
<p>&quot;Why else would the Government be spending $10 million on a three-year anti-smacking campaign which doesn&#39;t once mention the word &#39;smacking&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;No wonder parents are confused about how, when and why they should discipline their children,&quot; says Ms Collins.</p>
