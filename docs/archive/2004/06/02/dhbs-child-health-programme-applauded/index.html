<p>DHB&#39;s Child Health Programme Applauded</p>
<p>New Zealand First’s health spokesperson Barbara Stewart has applauded the Waikato District Health Board’s commitment to a research programme aimed at improving the health of children in Waikato schools.</p>
<p>“The two-year programme providing children at 65 schools with healthy living messages and incorporating healthy policies into schools may also mean the eventual return of free milk to schools in less affluent areas.</p>
<p>“In these days of less activity and more fast food, the incidence of obesity is an international problem and this sort of programme is a very worthwhile step towards dealing with it on a local level, said Mrs Stewart.</p>
<p>“The DHB’s initiative will benefit children in 65 schools for the first two years and subsequently, if the results of research are positive, to the entire Waikato population.</p>
<p>“The possibility of a return to free milk for schools is also good news and it is to be hoped that local companies will rise to the occasion and sponsor the programme to provide both milk and fruit. Such generosity would make a very valuable contribution to the welfare of the community,” said Mrs Stewart.</p>
