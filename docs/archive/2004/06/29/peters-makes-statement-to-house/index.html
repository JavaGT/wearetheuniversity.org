<p><strong>Tuesday, 29 June 2004, 2:20 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Media Release<br>29 June 2004</p>
<p>Peters Makes Statement To House</p>
<p>Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal statement to the House.</p>
<p>Allegations were made against me during my absence from New Zealand last week.</p>
<p>Those allegations are baseless and ridiculous and I immediately instructed my legal counsel to take action, seeking damages and costs from those organisations and individuals who promulgated those allegations.</p>
<p>Accordingly, papers were lodged in the High Court in Auckland today seeking damages and costs from Television New Zealand, Radio New Zealand, Yvonne Dossetter, Ken Shirley MP and David Carter MP.</p>
<p>Those who would publish or repeat such allegations either do not know me or know nothing of what I have achieved in my political career.</p>
<p>My only other comment is to say:</p>
<p>&quot;Who steals my purse steals trash; ’tis something, nothing;<br>’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands;<br>But he that filches from me my good name<br>Robs me of that which not enriches him,<br>And makes me poor indeed. “</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
