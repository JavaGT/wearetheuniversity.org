<p>Free condoms to be commended, not condemned</p>
<p>Green MP Nandor Tanczos congratulated student organisers of Edgewater College&#39;s school ball today for offering a free condom with each ticket and called on other school ball organisers to show a similar commitment to keeping young people safe.</p>
<p>Nandor, the Green Party&#39;s Youth Affairs spokesperson, said he was disappointed that moral indignation has forced Edgewater College into a &#39;condom recall&#39;, saying that New Zealand had to take practical steps to reduce its unacceptably high teenage pregnancy rate.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s sad that New Zealand teenagers still have to deal with a head-in-the-sand attitude,&quot; said Nandor. &quot;Some people seem to think that the best way to avoid teenage pregnancy is simply not to talk about it.</p>
<p>&quot;Supplying condoms at a school ball isn&#39;t an invitation for them to all have sex - some teenagers need no encouragement anyway. It was simply a creative idea to help students avoid an unplanned pregnancy or STD that could affect them for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#39;s remember that the handouts also included advice on saying no to sex.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand&#39;s teen pregnancy rate is ranked third out of 119 industrial nations, showing a willingness for young people to have sex even without contraception.</p>
<p>&quot;Good on Edgewater&#39;s students for taking a sensible approach to this problem, given that we all know that many young people do have sex, including on the night of their school ball.</p>
<p>&quot;Edgewater&#39;s student-run Peer Sexuality Support Team has a much better handle on the situation than the adults, who seem to have forgotten what they themselves were doing when they were teenagers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Headmaster Allan Vester has nothing to apologise for - in fact, he should be commended for supporting young people taking practical steps to confront an issue that affects them.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope other schools support their students in making their school ball experience is as safe and enjoyable as possible,&quot; said Nandor.  </p>
