<p>Politics Alive And Well At Victoria</p>
<p>The weekly policy-setting forum of the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) came alive yesterday with a plethora of motions pushing VUWSA policy further right on some issues that it has been for some time.</p>
<p>Student Representative Council (SRC) requires a quorum of 50 of the over 18000 students of Victoria to be present and voting. Between 50 and 65 students were present throughout the meeting.</p>
<p>VUWSA President Amanda Hill said that “it was great to see real debate – although the small group moving the motions rarely took the microphone to support them – and it is refreshing to see students taking an interest in what is happening both on their campus and in the world around them”</p>
<p>Among the policies to be passed were: The condemnation of the lack of consultation on the Library’s Collection Appraisal Project A motion of condolence to Auckland University on the appointment of current Victoria Vice-Chancellor to a similar position Support for tax cuts for the 33% tax bracket Condemnation of any move to reintroduce the death penalty Support for the continuation of the anti-nuclear policy.</p>
<p>“Any policy can be revoked with a similar motion at SRC, which gives VUWSA a great deal of flexibility in its policy” Hill said. “It is pleasing to see such a change in perspective from many of the right-wing groups, from discounting the SRC forum as an undemocratic crank, to actively taking part in it”.</p>
