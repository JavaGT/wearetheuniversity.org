<p>Victoria University Students Support Tax Cuts</p>
<p>Thursday 3 Jun 2004</p>
<p>Rodney Hide - Press Releases - Taxation</p>
<p>ACT New Zealand Finance Spokesman Rodney Hide today applauded Victoria University students for passing the following motions into the Victoria University Student Association&#39;s (VUWSA) policy at the Student Representative Council on Monday June 2, 2004:</p>
<p>· That VUWSA support tax cuts as the most effective means to help students deal with their debt problems;</p>
<p>· That VUWSA denounce communism;</p>
<p>· That VUWSA support one standard of citizenship, as advocated by Don Brash and ACT;</p>
<p>· That VUWSA support capitalism as the most effective societal structure to help students;</p>
<p>· That VUWSA thank Richard Prebble for his contribution to ACT, Parliament and New Zealand.</p>
<p>President of ACT on Campus at Victoria University Michael Collins said: &quot;The fact that students support tax cuts and free-market capitalism shows that young people today are acutely aware that New Zealand&#39;s future is dependent on a strong long-term economy that will only be delivered through these structures.</p>
<p>&quot;This follows hot on the heels of a similar motion passed at Auckland University, calling for tax cuts, earlier this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Support for `one law for all&#39; demonstrates that students are frustrated by the continual political correctness favoured by the current Labour regime. Students are affected by `positive&#39; discrimination more than most sectors of society,&quot; Mr Collins said.</p>
<p>&quot;The motions passed reflect a growing view that enough is enough, and that students are not prepared to put up with discrimination of any sort any longer,&quot; Mr Hide said.</p>
