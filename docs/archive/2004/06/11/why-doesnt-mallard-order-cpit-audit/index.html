<p><strong>Friday, 11 June 2004, 12:47 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Why doesn&#39;t Mallard order CPIT audit?</p>
<p>Education Minister Trevor Mallard should be consistent and order an audit into allegations of a conflict of interest at Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology, says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>The Minister has ordered an audit into allegations of a conflict of interest at Cambridge High School, saying it would be irresponsible not to follow them up.</p>
<p>&quot;A comparison of the conflict at Cambridge High School and the allegations issued at Christchurch Polytechnic shows that the Minister is applying different standards,&quot; Mr English says.</p>
<p>&quot;The principal of Cambridge High, Alison Annan, is accused of using public money to benefit her private business, an international college.</p>
<p>&quot;Senior staff members at CPIT, including former Christchurch Mayor Vicki Buck, are directors of a private software company which has received more than $5 million of public money as part of a deal with CPIT.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Mallard has taken high-profile, personal steps to secure an inquiry into the case of Cambridge High but has sat on his hands over CPIT.</p>
<p>&quot;He has to explain why he is so motivated about one apparent conflict of interest involving Cambridge High and not at all interested in the apparent conflict involving Christchurch Polytech,&quot; Mr English says.  </p>
