<p><strong>Tuesday, 1 June 2004, 2:55 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>

<p>New Zealand First law and order spokesperson Ron Mark today called for the Chinese students involved with the illegal Cuba Street casino to be given heavy fines and sent home on the next plane.</p>
<p>At the same time, Mr Mark warned the public that assuming the offenders will be deported after their convictions was little more than wishful thinking because of the soft approach by immigration authorities.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First has long been concerned with the amount of crime being imported by way of our open door immigration policy.</p>
<p>“This casino racket is just the latest in a string of crimes being committed by those privileged enough to be allowed to learn here,” said Mr Mark.</p>
<p>He also described the casino operation as the tip of the iceberg when it came to organised Asian crime.</p>
<p>“We have been approached by senior members in the Chinese community who have expressed concern that the use of such gambling dens is widespread and is threatening the good name of New Zealand’s long term Chinese community.</p>
<p>“The problem is, even when these offenders are caught and rightly served with deportation orders, the Deportations Review Tribunal often overturns the orders and lets these undesirables stay in the country.</p>
<p>“For those of you saying ‘send them home’, don’t hold your breath”, concluded Mr Mark.</p>
