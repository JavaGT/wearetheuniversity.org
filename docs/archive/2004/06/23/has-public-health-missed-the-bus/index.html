<p>Has public health missed the bus?</p>
<p>One of the aims of the New Zealand Transport Strategy is to &quot;protect and promote public health&quot;, but a group of experts in Auckland argue that health is still a marginal consideration in transport planning and funding.</p>
<p>At a debate at The University of Auckland&#39;s School of Population Health this evening , experts will question whether public health has marginalised itself by being insufficiently involved with transport planning or whether transport planners marginalise health as a consideration in their strategy.</p>
<p>The debate will bring together academics, planners, and industry specialists from the transport and health sectors at the University&#39;s Tamaki Campus.</p>
<p>The evening will be facilitated by Warren Lindberg, Public Health Planner for the Northern District Health Board Support Agency.</p>
<p>Speakers include:</p>
<p>* Virginia Hope - Environmental Health Strategist and Medical Officer of Health * Alistair Woodward - Head, School of Population Health, The University of Auckland * Robin Kearns - School of Geography and Environmental Science, The University of Auckland * Sandra Coney - Auckland Regional Council * Tim Hazledine - Department of Economics, The University of Auckland * Stephen Selwood - General Manager, Transport Policy, Automobile Association of New Zealand * David Craig - Department of Sociology, The University of Auckland * Martin Dawe - Director, Health and Safety Development * Chris Freke - Manager, Transportation, Manukau City Council * Jenny Dixon/Elizabeth Aitken-Rose - Department of Planning, The University of Auckland</p>
