<p>Midwives And Women Celebrate 100 Years At AUT’s, Faculty Of Health</p>
<p>To celebrate the 100 years of midwifery registration in New Zealand, a fourteen panel, travelling photographic exhibition, will be on display at AUT’s Faculty of Health on the North Shore from Monday 21st –28th June.</p>
<p>Born –Midwives and Women Celebrate 100 Years was launched in parliament on May 5th, 2004 (International Midwives Day) and celebrates that historical legislative commitment to women and their babies. This touring exhibition is travelling throughout New Zealand and gives a snap shot view of what Midwifery in New Zealand has been and has become.</p>
<p>As part of the Auckland launch, the Faculty of Health will host an opening ceremony (open to the public) on Monday 21st June 5.30pm –7.30pm. This exhibition invites viewers into the hearts and minds of midwives, sharing the celebration of this important occasion.</p>
<p>The exhibition features stories from midwives selected by their colleagues, which are representative of the wide variety of settings in which midwives work. As these stories unfold we are given an insight into the remarkable development of the midwifery profession in Aotearoa/New Zealand and the place of midwives within the communities in which they work.</p>
<p>Woven throughout stories are comments from mothers and fathers who have experienced the services that midwives offer.</p>
<p>AUT’s Faculty of Health offers a three-year undergraduate programme, BHSc (Midwifery) and registration as a Registered Midwife with the Nursing Council of New Zealand. Opportunities also exist for postgraduate studies, including Postgraduate Certificate, Postgraduate Diploma, Master of Health Science, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and Doctor of Health Science (DHSc).</p>
