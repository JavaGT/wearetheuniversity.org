<p><strong>Tuesday, 22 June 2004, 11:21 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Minister must get to grips with CYFS</p>
<p>National Party MP Katherine Rich is asking what it takes to set the alarm bells ringing at CYFS after a baby, whose two siblings had already been removed from their mother&#39;s care, was left fighting for his life with head injuries.</p>
<p>&quot;My heart sinks when I hear about these awful stories. CYFS really needs a Minister who&#39;s prepared to get stuck in and sort it out for the sake of all our vulnerable kids.</p>
<p>&quot;All the warning signs were there. The alarm bells should have been sounding, given that two of the woman&#39;s children had already been removed from her care.</p>
<p>&quot;When it comes to a child&#39;s life, I&#39;d like to think that social workers would err on the side of caution.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Rich says first and foremost, responsibility lies with the parents, but CYFS has been at the centre of too many horror stories in recent times.</p>
<p>&quot;All New Zealanders expect far better,&quot; says Mrs Rich.</p>
<p>&quot;Where are the results from the extra millions of taxpayer dollars that has gone into CYFS?&quot;</p>
<p>In October last year after the damning Baseline Review found &#39;deep and systemic problems&#39; at CYFS, the Government announced an extra $120 million for the service over four years.</p>
<p>&quot;But answers to parliamentary questions released just last month show thousands of phone-calls are still going unanswered.</p>
<p>&quot;Those calls are all potential notifications and they are all potential tragedies,&quot; says Mrs Rich.  </p>
