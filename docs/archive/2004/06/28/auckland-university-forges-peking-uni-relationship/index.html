<p>Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences forges relationship with Peking University</p>
<p>The University of Auckland&#39;s Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences has formed a close graduate teaching and research relationship with counterparts from China&#39;s top university.</p>
<p>Senior officials from Peking University were in Auckland this week to formalise the relationship, which will see the two universities working together on issues relating to Asian health, as well as drug development and immunology research.</p>
<p>Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences Dean Professor Peter Smith says the new relationship is an acknowledgment of the quality of research taking place at both institutions and would be beneficial to both countries.</p>
<p>&quot;This agreement provides us the opportunity to expand our research focus, particularly in the area of Asian health, which will become more important with New Zealand&#39;s changing demographics. It also means the Faculty can build its graduate teaching links with staff and students from China,&quot; says Professor Smith.</p>
<p>The Vice President of Peking University Health Science Center, Professor Yang Ke, will be in New Zealand with other colleagues from the University in November to attend an International Asian Health Conference at Auckland&#39;s School of Population Health.</p>
