<p>Hon Bill English</p>
<p>National Education Spokesman</p>

<p>Polytechs face huge funding cuts</p>
<p>The Government&#39;s policy to cut enrolments in community education courses by 30% will mean significant funding cuts for polytechs says National education spokesman Bill English.</p>
<p>Acting Tertiary Education Minister, Margaret Wilson confirmed the 30% reduction at select committee last week.</p>
<p>&quot;But when asked how, she couldn&#39;t give me an answer,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>Funding for community education courses grew from $13 million in 2000 to an estimated $115 million this year.</p>
<p>In the Budget the Government announced it wanted to cut funding for community education by $144m over the next three years. So far they have cut the funding per student, which will save about $40 million over three years.</p>
<p>The cut in enrolments will add to the losses polytechs already face with another $80 million in reduced funding over the next three years.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is vacillating over whether to negotiate funding cuts or force them on polytechs across the board,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
<p>&quot;The blow-out was caused by a handful of polytechs but these cuts punish everyone for the actions of a few.</p>
<p>&quot;These cuts will be serious for some polytechs with large community funding enrolments and they are likely to resist the policy.</p>
<p>&quot;This is yet another episode that undermines the credibility of the Government Tertiary Education Strategy which is a mess of the Government&#39;s own making.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government has spent millions of dollars on developing the Tertiary Education Commission which was supposed to &#39;steer&#39; the sector, but clearly it has failed in its mission,&quot; says Mr English.</p>
