<p><strong>Monday, 28 June 2004, 1:14 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>28 June 2004</p>
<p>PM to give Paterson Oration at Victoria University</p>
<p>New Zealand Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Helen Clark, is to give the John Paterson Oration at Victoria University&#39;s Pipitea Campus in downtown Wellington today (June 28).</p>
<p>The speech is an Australia and New Zealand School of Government (ANZSOG) event. Victoria University is a foundation member, along with the New Zealand and Australian Federal governments, three state governments and nine leading Australian universities.</p>
<p>The event is named after Dr John Paterson, a senior Australian public servant, who died in February last year. The inaugural Paterson Oration was given by Australian Prime Minister, the Hon John Howard, in Sydney last year.</p>
<p>The School offers a Master of Public Administration (Executive) degree to about 120 senior public servants from both countries each year. It has a small teaching complement of outstanding academics based in Melbourne as well as staff drawn from the contributing universities.</p>
<p>The first group, which started the programme last year, will spend a week at Victoria undertaking a course with an Australian staff member, while the second group, who began studying this year, is undertaking a policy course with a Victoria staff member in July.</p>
<p>Pro Vice-Chancellor, Professor Matthew Palmer said the University was delighted to host the Paterson Oration and was committed to its involvement in ANZSOG.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr John Paterson was one of Australia&#39;s most esteemed public servants, providing governments from across the political spectrum with practical solutions to long-standing problems, ensuring delivery of a better public service. That focus on intellectual rigour and a creative approach to complex policy issues is at the heart of the programmes that both ANZSOG and Victoria&#39;s own School of Government offer.</p>

<p>&quot;The State Sectors in both countries have experienced major reforms since the 1980s and Victoria has a long-standing history of educating public servants. In addition to our involvement in ANZSOG, we have also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the New Zealand State Services Commission to provide a strategic direction for public sector education.</p>
<p>&quot;Victoria&#39;s academics, both within our own School of Government and elsewhere in the University, have a wealth of leading edge state sector policy and research knowledge. That status was confirmed when Victoria&#39;s academics topped the Performance-Based Research Fund exercise as the best researchers in the political science, international relations and public policy subject area.&quot;</p>
<p>Victoria&#39;s School of Government is based in the University&#39;s Pipitea Campus, in the heart of the Capital&#39;s political, legal and commercial district.</p>
