<p>Màori Scholars&#39; Works And Taonga To Be Housed Together<br>At Waikato University Library</p>
<p>Two highly respected sons of Tainui, the late scholars Pei Te Hurinui Jones and Emeritus Professor Bruce Biggs, were individually brilliant.</p>
<p>Pei Jones was a noted Ngàti Maniapoto leader, writer and interpreter who, for example, translated Shakespeare into Màori. Professor Biggs, also of Ngàti Maniapoto descent, has been described as &quot;the most influential figure in academic Màori studies in the 20th century&quot;.</p>
<p>Together they were also brilliant, with Professor Biggs completing Nga Iwi o Tainui, a Màori-language traditional history of the Tainui tribes, which Pei Jones begun compiling in the 1920s. The book was published in 1995 to national acclaim.</p>
<p>Now a new room, Mahi Màreikura, at Waikato University&#39;s library will house a joint collection of their works and taonga, including manuscripts, whakapapa scrolls, patu and kakahu. The room will be open for students, scholars and the public. Pei Jones&#39; works and taonga have been donated to the university on behalf of the Jones family by his son Brian, while Waikato University has itself purchased works of Professor Biggs.</p>
<p>The official opening of Mahi Màreikura, at 10.30am Monday 5 July on the library&#39;s level three, will be attended by the Màori Queen, Dame Te Atirangikahu, whànau and iwi representatives.</p>
<p>Tom Roa, a senior lecturer in the university Màori department, says: &quot;Mahi Màreikura will be an important new resource for students and scholars. It will also be a monument to the personal and professional relationship between these two Tainui giants.&quot;</p>
