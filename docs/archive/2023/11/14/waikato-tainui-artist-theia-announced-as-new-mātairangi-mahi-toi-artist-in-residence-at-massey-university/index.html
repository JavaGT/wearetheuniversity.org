<p><strong>Theia</strong>, who this year won the coveted <strong>Taite Prize</strong> for ‘<strong>Best Independent Album’</strong> with her reo Māori project <strong>TE KAAHU</strong>, will be officially welcomed with a pōwhiri on to <strong>Te Rau Karamu Marae</strong>, <strong>Massey University Pukeahu campus</strong> on <strong>November 15</strong>.</p>
<p>The following night, on <strong>November 16</strong>, she will perform an intimate <strong>TE KAAHU</strong> show for students and staff from <strong>Toi Rauwhārangi College of Creative Arts</strong>. There are also a small number of tickets available for members of the public. Click here for more info.</p>
<p>The <strong>Mātairangi Mahi Toi Residency</strong> was created by <strong>Toi Rauwhārangi</strong> in partnership with the office of the <strong>Governor General</strong> to support the development of Māori and Pacific visual arts and creative practices. Previous recipients of the residency include <strong>Troy Kingi</strong>, <strong>Horomona Horo</strong> and <strong>Lindah Lepou</strong>.</p>

<p>Through the generosity of the office of the <strong>Governor General</strong> artists were able to live and work in a house in the grounds of Government House. This year the college has partnered with <strong>Te Whare Hera</strong> to be able to continue the residency and provide a Māori artist with a paid opportunity to reside in Wellington and take full advantage of the world class facilities and resources available to them at <strong>Toi Rauwhārangi College of Creative Arts</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Theia</strong> is an enigmatic artist who effortlessly straddles the two worlds of her riot-pop namesake and her award-winning reo rangatira project, <strong>TE KAAHU</strong>. Both projects reflect her artistry and demonstrate a sharp wit and poetic beauty set to different sonic landscapes. Where her <strong>Theia</strong> bangers challenge and confront social injustices; <strong>TE KAAHU</strong> explores themes of spirituality, whakapapa and the environment.</p>
<p>Her catalogue in reo Pākehā has drawn a loyal fan base across the globe, receiving critical acclaim from the likes of <strong>Pigeons &amp; Planes</strong>, <strong>Rolling Stone</strong>, <strong>Clash</strong> and <strong>Billboard Magazine</strong>. Her songs have earned her a multitude of nominations at the <strong>New Zealand Music Awards</strong>, the <strong>Waiata Māori Music Awards</strong>, the <strong>George FM Awards</strong>, as well as commercial radio play in NZ, Australia, and Asia, alongside local chart success.</p>
<p><strong>TE KAAHU</strong> has also seen local and international success. Alongside being awarded the <strong>Taite Prize for Best Independent Debut</strong>, in the last 18 months <strong>TE KAAHU</strong> has been a finalist in the <strong>Rolling Stone NZ Awards</strong>, the <strong>AMAs</strong>, the <strong>APRA Maioha Award</strong>, the <strong>Waiata Māori Music Awards</strong>, and the <strong>Student Radio Network Awards.</strong> <strong>Theia</strong> has also toured <strong>TE KAAHU</strong> in Canada, performing at the iconic <strong>Calgary Folk Music Festival</strong> and <strong>Folk on the Rocks</strong> in Yellowknife.</p>
<p><strong>Theia</strong> is excited to take up the residency and is looking forward to completing her debut <strong>Theia</strong> album and writing new waiata for <strong>TE KAAHU</strong> during the residency. “I’m honoured to join in the legacy of <strong>Mātairangi Mahi Toi</strong> for 2023/24 as both a proud young Waikato woman and a passionate composer and performer.”</p>
<p>News of the residency comes on the back of the critically acclaimed <strong>GIRL IN A SAVAGE WORLD Tour,</strong> which brought <strong>Theia</strong> and <strong>TE KAAHU</strong> together for the first time on the same stage. Although now officially over, <strong>Theia</strong> has just announced that she will present one final show for Auckland friends and fans, with an intimate performance at <strong>Freida Margolis</strong> in <strong>Grey Lynn</strong> on <strong>December 3</strong>. Only a few tickets remain for this show. Click here.</p>
