<p>Filling in for Barry this week. It&#39;s been lovely to see Christmas decorations starting to go up around campus. If you are involved with exam marking, I hope you are coping with the increased workload.</p>
<p>National branch presidents’ hui. Nicole, Andy and I attended the national branch presidents hui in Wellington last Thursday and Friday, and discussed goals for next year. With the upcoming National-Act-NZ First Government, it&#39;s quite likely the tertiary sector will face cutbacks. Also discussed was the pay equity campaign (see below for how you can get involved), and the need for the new Government puts staff at the heart of any tertiary sector funding review. On top of these, academic and professional collective bargaining is starting again next year. By recruiting your colleagues and building connections with your local community allies - such as your students, local MPs, community organisations, and faith groups - we can gain strength and influence these changes.
There was also a good reminder that we need a mix of light-hearted events along with activism. Stay tuned for news on that.</p>

<p>Branch Planning Day Your Branch Committee will be running Branch Planning Day in early December to plan out projects and priorities next year. If you&#39;d like to get more involved with the branch, please get in touch.</p>

<p>Trouble with open-access publishing. Earlier this year, the entire editorial boards of two companion neuroimaging journals resigned<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5</a>. The 42 researchers were protesting against what they thought to be excessive article-processing charges (APCs) for authors publishing in the journals, which are run by Dutch publishing giant Elsevier. Who should pay for open-access publishing? APC alternatives emerge <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03506-4">nature.com</a></p>
