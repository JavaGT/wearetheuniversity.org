<p>I wanted to let you know that from this week onwards, there are likely to be a number of stories in the media based on an Employment Court case, which the University of Auckland is defending.</p>
<p>I do not intend traversing the claim and counter claim which this case hinges on, but I do want to remind everyone once more of the ways in which we provide support for staff to keep themselves safe.</p>
<p>Our Staff Risk Intervention Team (SRIT<a href="https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/central-services/staff-risk-intervention-team.html">https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/central-services/staff-risk-intervention-team.html</a>) is available to support anyone experiencing harassment from an external or unknown source. This team are also able to draw upon a Staff Support Specialist and offer social media monitoring which can include email quarantine support. There is also personalised support and guidance for anyone who would like to understand more about digital or physical safety measures<a href="https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/human-resources/support/support-for-staff-experiencing-external-harassment.html">https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/human-resources/support/support-for-staff-experiencing-external-harassment.html</a> that they can take.</p>
<p>We remain committed to the safety and well-being of our staff, and if you or any of your colleagues have concerns at any time, then it’s important you talk to your line manager or Human Resources partner so that we can help you.</p>
<p>I am determined that the University will be open and transparent with our community on these challenging issues, and while it may be some time before I am able to further discuss the matters at hand, I commit to doing so in the future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I would ask that we continue to live out our core institutional value of respect for others as the judicial process unfolds.</p>
<p>Ngā mihi nui</p>
