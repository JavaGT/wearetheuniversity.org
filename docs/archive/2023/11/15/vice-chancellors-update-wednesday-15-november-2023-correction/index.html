<p>World University Rankings</p>
<p>Academic reputation and employer reputation are important components in how the University is perceived. Two of the leading world rankings are running reputation surveys to assess this.</p>
<p>I encourage all staff to participate in the QS World University Rankings 2025 Reputation Surveys by nominating your academic and employer contacts who can vouch for the University of Auckland’s academic excellence and the success of our graduates. You can learn more about the QS World University Rankings 2025 Reputation Surveys<a href="https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/article/qs-world-university-rankings-reputation-surveys">https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/article/qs-world-university-rankings-reputation-surveys</a> and submit your nominations by visiting the ResearchHub. The nomination period closes on Thursday 30 November.</p>
<p>In addition, the Times Higher Education (THE) Global Academic Reputation Survey is underway, allowing participants to vote for the University of Auckland as well as other world-leading universities. Invitations to take part in this survey are sent directly to academic staff members from THE in November.</p>
