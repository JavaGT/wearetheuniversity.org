<p>Save the date. The branch committee wishes to invite members to an end of year celebration. We have settled on 3pm-5pm, Tues 12 December at OGH. We will confirm these details by email invitation. It would be great to see members there after the year that we have had.</p>
<p>We have a three-legged government. TEU’s national office has worked to provide information as to what to expect, given the announcements of the coalition agreements (details here<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/app?q=%2Bproject%3Anational-act-nz-first-coa-216035%20">https://www.documentcloud.org/app?q=%2Bproject%3Anational-act-nz-first-coa-216035%20</a>) and ministerial appointments.</p>
<p>Penny Simmonds (National, Invercargill) is Minister of Tertiary Education, but she is outside cabinet. She is a graduate of U Otago and was the chief executive of the Southern Institute of Technology (1997-2020).</p>
<p>Brooke van Velden (ACT, Tāmaki) is the Minister of Workplace Relations and Safety. According to Wikipedia, she studied economics and international trade at the University of Auckland and she graduated with a conjoint BA-BCom in 2016.</p>

Education</p>
</li>
<li><p>Replace the Fees Free programme with a final year fees free policy with no change before 2025.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Amend the Education and Training Act 2020 such that tertiary education providers receiving taxpayer funding must commit to a free speech policy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From the New Zealand First/National agreement:
Employment and Immigration</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Strengthen obligations on Jobseeker work ready beneficiaries to find work and make use of sanctions for non-compliance with work obligations and consider time limits for under-25s.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Improve the Accredited Employer Work Visa to focus the immigration system on attracting the workers and skills New Zealand needs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Commit to moderate increases to the minimum wage every year.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ensure Immigration New Zealand is engaged in proper risk management and verification to ensure migrants are filling genuine workforce needs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Investigate the establishment of an “Essential Worker” workforce planning mechanism to better plan for skill or labour shortages in the long term.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Commit to enforcement and action to ensure those found responsible for the abuse of migrant workers face appropriate consequences.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Address and provide solutions for the long-expressed concern of the OECD into the lack of focus in New Zealand Immigration Policy.
Education</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stop first year Fees Free and replace with a final year Fees Free with no change before 2025.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Maintain the Apprenticeship Boost scheme.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Refocus the curriculum on academic achievement and not ideology, including the removal and replacement of the gender, sexuality, and relationship-based education guidelines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
