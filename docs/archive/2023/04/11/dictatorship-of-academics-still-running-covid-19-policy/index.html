<p><strong>Tuesday, 11 April 2023, 5:44 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“A dictatorship of unelected academics is still running what remains of the Government’s Covid-19 policy, imposing significant costs on New Zealanders for little benefit, and showing reckless disregard for working people and businesses,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“These academics can work from their laptop at home. They don’t have to leave the house to earn a buck and they don’t care what costs they’re imposing on workers and small businesses with the advice they’re giving to the Government.</p>
<p>“Modelling from Covid-19 Modelling Aotearoa published this afternoon makes no reference to outcomes in countries which have already dropped isolation requirements and says &quot;There is significant uncertainty as to the impact of a change in the COVID-19 isolation policy on transmission’ because ‘firstly the current behaviour of people with COVID-19 is not well known and secondly the change in behaviour in response to the policy change is difficult to predict.&quot; They don’t have a clue about two critical pieces of information.</p>
<p>“By listening to a coterie of Covid experts and ignoring real New Zealanders, it seems Chris Hipkins is no different to Jacinda Ardern after all.</p>
<p>“Other countries like the UK, Australia, Singapore, France, Spain, Greece and Portugal introduced voluntary isolation periods a long time ago.</p>
<p>“Today, during the preamble to his post-Cabinet press conference, Hipkins forget to announce that isolation periods will remain the same for the next two months. The Prime Minister had to be reminded by a journalist. That sums up just how little the Government cares about the costs it is imposing on New Zealanders.</p>

<p>“Modelling from Covid-19 Modelling Aotearoa published this afternoon makes no reference to outcomes in countries which have already dropped isolation requirements and says &quot;There is significant uncertainty as to the impact of a change in the COVID-19 isolation policy on transmission.&quot; They have little idea about the two pieces of information fundamental to the modelling.</p>
<p>“Retaining a seven-day mandatory Covid isolation period makes New Zealand a global oddity. It’s a kind of Hermit Kingdom redux, 2023 edition, where Labour keeps treating adults like kids and putting costs on the economy like money is no object.</p>
<p>“Not only is the isolation requirement draconian and out of touch, but it is also ineffective. Nobody knows the true compliance rate, least of all the Government. We suspect mandatory 7-day isolation is counterproductive. If the rules are too strict, people who cannot afford to follow them will not, and there will actually be more transmission than an approach based on personal responsibility.</p>
<p>“ACT said last February that people who isolate with a positive test should be able to leave isolation with a negative test. <a href="https://actnz.nationbuilder.com/r?u=wLjlmEt85aWOap8U3xAJnDDtR_pH8_e4pfeduoOfA8K4qZrOCg6XkdqZJ70w73s_DaZTvOctNDhWhAKhMSp29Mttq36ymUSqyQzql1Bf-JA&e=752ed10e9ed7db3a7867d6b86ebadc6c&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=dictatorship_of_academics_stil&n=2">Modelling last August</a> showed ACT was correct, a test-to-freedom policy would deliver “a 40% reduction in the number of cases infectious at release and hours infectious post-release.”</p>
<p>“In the 14 months since last February the rest of the world has moved on. In the U.K. isolation has been voluntary since last September. Australia’s National Cabinet ended mandatory isolation requirements last October. Singapore’s Government decommissioned its Covid website in February, they’re really moved on.</p>
<p>“The current advice on the main Singapore Health website says “If there is a need to go out while symptomatic, or if asymptomatic but tested positive for COVID-19, we should exercise social responsibility – minimise social interactions, wear a mask, avoid crowded places, do not visit vulnerable settings such as hospitals and nursing homes, and do not have contact with vulnerable persons, such as the elderly.”</p>
<p>“It’s long past time for the New Zealand Government to treat citizens like adults again and issue similar advice. The alternative is a worst of all worlds scenario where the Government treats adults like children, the few who do comply pay high costs, and those who don’t keep the virus circulating.</p>
<p>“The fact the Government has sat on this, month after month, shows reckless disregard for the people of New Zealand. They are happy to impose high costs with little benefit, and take their sweet time getting around to fixing it. Covid isolation should have been made voluntary today.&quot;</p>
