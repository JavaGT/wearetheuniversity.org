<p><strong>Sunday, 16 April 2023, 3:08 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Kieran McAnulty’s statements today on the intersection between the Treaty and our democracy are confusing and concerning, National’s Justice spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>“The Local Government Minister conceded on TVNZ’s <em>Q&amp;A</em> this morning that the co-governance arrangements in the Three Waters reform moved away from a one person, one vote sense of democracy, but claimed the Treaty required it.</p>
<p>“National does not believe that honouring the Treaty requires abandoning the concept of equal citizenship.</p>
<p>“Mr McAnulty said there ‘are provisions that we have in this country that wouldn’t stand up to a purely academic democratic framework, but that’s not how we work in New Zealand’.</p>
<p>“The examples he used were ridiculous – the governance arrangements for two rivers following Treaty settlements and the existence of Māori seats.</p>
<p>“Māori seats are consistent with democracy because they are proportional to the population.</p>
<p>“Labour is taking a very different approach regarding water - and its proposed RMA replacement - decisively moving away from proportionality and an equal standard of citizenship, in reforms that affect every New Zealander.</p>
<p>“With the Canterbury Regional Council (Ngāi Tahu Representation) Act they have extended this approach to the electoral system, giving Māori disproportionate voting rights in that region.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister needs to clarify immediately why his Government has moved away from an equal standard of citizenship, and he should ask New Zealanders if they agree.</p>

<p>“One of the founding principles of the National Party is equal citizenship. We recognise Māori have rights and interests in water, but do not accept that 50/50 co-governance is required to give effect to that.</p>
<p>“There is plenty of room for consultation with iwi over matters of particular concern to them, but it cannot accommodate a shift away from equal voting rights and an equal say for all New Zealanders in major decisions affecting our lives.”</p>
