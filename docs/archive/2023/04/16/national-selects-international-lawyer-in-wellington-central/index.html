<p><strong>Sunday, 16 April 2023, 3:04 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>International lawyer, human rights expert and diplomat Dr Scott Sheeran has been selected by local party members as National’s candidate in Wellington Central for this year’s General Election.</p>
<p>“I’m deeply thankful to our local party members for putting their faith in me to campaign strongly in Wellington Central to elect a National Government,” says Dr Sheeran.</p>
<p>“I love Wellington and want it to be a city where people thrive and prosper. If I earn the opportunity to become an MP, I’ll be focused on the issues that matter most to people here, especially reducing the cost-of-living.</p>
<p>“Labour is spending $1 billion more per week than National was, yet Wellingtonians have little to show for it but higher costs and worse outcomes in health, education, transport and crime.</p>
<p>“Homeowners in Wellington are being forced to find hundreds of dollars more per week to cover rising mortgage repayments as rates are hiked to fight inflation and Labour’s economic mismanagement. Renters, including students, are also struggling, with their median weekly rent up $200.</p>
<p>“Wellingtonians rightly celebrate our innovative, creative and vibrant city but without action on the cost-of-living crisis, we’ll lose the people and opportunities that make this city so incredible. I’m standing for National because it’s the only party with a plan to grow our economy and lower the cost-of-living, with the ability to deliver on it.</p>
<p>“I’ve spent many years living and working around the world, but I’ve always considered Wellington home. It’s where my family home is, it’s where my wife and I want our kids to grow up, and it’s where I want everyone to have the chance to thrive.”</p>
