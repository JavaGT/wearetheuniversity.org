<p><strong>Thursday, 20 April 2023, 10:15 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National will increase the penalties for those who obstruct major thoroughfares, like the anti-road activists who once again blocked key roads in Wellington, causing significant disruption this morning, National’s Transport spokesperson Simeon Brown says.</p>
<p>“It is utterly unacceptable that anti-road activists are once again obstructing Wellington’s State Highways and tunnels, causing major disruption to thousands of commuters and businesses.</p>
<p>“Wellingtonians are rightly furious as they face long delays and are forced off buses because roads are blocked.</p>
<p>“National has proposed legislation to introduce a new offence which will increase the penalty for people engaging in this behaviour to a maximum penalty of up to two years in prison, a fine of $20,000, or both. This is in line with what other countries have had to do following this type of highly disruptive behaviour.</p>
<p>“This will apply to a person who, without reasonable excuse, enters, remains on, climbs, jumps from, or otherwise trespasses on a major bridge, tunnel, or road and causes damage or seriously disrupts or obstructs vehicles or pedestrians.</p>
<p>“This means that if the route is closed or traffic is diverted as a result of the conduct, and if there is no reasonable excuse like an accident or having a permit, then there will be greater consequences than exist under current laws.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t stop people from protesting, but it makes it crystal clear that if you blockade a motorway, you will face consequences.</p>
<p>“Not only is such conduct annoying to commuters, but it is also downright reckless and dangerous.</p>
<p>“This bill will send the appropriate signal to deter such unacceptable behaviour.”</p>
