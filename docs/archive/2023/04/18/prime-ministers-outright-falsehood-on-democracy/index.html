<p><strong>Tuesday, 18 April 2023, 12:31 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister Chris Hipkins’ statement on our electoral system show his Government is being deceitful in its constitutional changes, National’s Justice spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>Mr Hipkins told RNZ’s <em>Morning Report</em>: “There’s absolutely no change to the principle of one person one vote. Our elections are still going to be one person, one vote for councils, for general elections.”</p>
<p>“This is demonstrably not the case,” Mr Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>“Last year Labour passed the Canterbury Regional Council (Ngāi Tahu Representation) Act, which clearly moves away from the principle of one person, one vote.</p>
<p>“Under the Canterbury Act, the people of Canterbury elect 14 councillors. Everyone gets a vote – Māori, Pakeha and everyone else. And then something extraordinary happens: Ngāi Tahu appoints two more councillors, with no voting and no election.</p>
<p>“One person, one vote has been abandoned in Canterbury.</p>
<p>“Labour MPs made it clear during the passage of the Canterbury Bill that it was intended to be the first of many across our local government sector.</p>
<p>“Former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern never justified or even spoke about the Bill. The current Prime Minister now pretends it doesn’t even exist.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister needs to correct the record, and then he needs to explain why he thinks ‘one person, one vote’ is no longer appropriate for Canterbury.</p>
<p>“National has promised to repeal the Canterbury Regional Council (Ngāi Tahu Representation) Act and will restore equal voting rights for all New Zealanders.”</p>
