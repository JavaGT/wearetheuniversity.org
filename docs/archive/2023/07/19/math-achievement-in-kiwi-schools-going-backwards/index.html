<p><strong>Wednesday, 19 July 2023, 6:28 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>New data shows Kiwi students are doing worse in maths than they were four years ago, National Education spokesperson Erica Stanford says.</p>
<p>“Achievement data released this week shows that just 42 per cent of Year 8 students are meeting curriculum expectations in maths, with a significant drop in achievement for girls, Pacific and Māori students.</p>
<p>&quot;It also shows that our most vulnerable students in low decile schools are an appalling two and half years behind in their learning compared to their peers in high decile schools.</p>
<p>“This is an utter failure from a Labour Government that is spending over $5 billion more on education and still presiding over worsening achievement.</p>
<p>“Learners from lower socioeconomic backgrounds depend on a good education to afford them every opportunity to change their circumstances and lead the lives they want.</p>
<p>“Sadly, Labour’s misguided approach to education has only made things worse for these students.</p>
<p>“Not only is achievement going in the wrong direction, but school attendance has fallen to an unprecedented low.</p>
<p>“What Labour is doing is not working. Currently, their only strategy appears to be dumbing down the curriculum and making tests easier.</p>
<p>&quot;Without a vision for the future, Labour is robbing hundreds of thousands of Kiwi kids of the world-class education they deserve.</p>
<p>“A National government will tackle our falling standards with our plan to <em>Teach the Basics Brilliantly</em> so every student has the same opportunity to live the life they want.”</p>

<p>A National government will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that primary and intermediate students spend an hour on average on reading, writing, and maths every day.</li>
<li>Set minimum requirements for what schools must teach every year in reading, writing, maths and science.</li>
<li>Implement regular standardised assessment with clear reporting to parents.</li>
<li>Deliver better training and more tools to support teachers.</li>
</ul>
