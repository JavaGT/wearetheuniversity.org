<p><strong>Friday, 7 July 2023, 11:43 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>An eye-watering $10 million bill for temporary back office staff at the Ministry of Education is unacceptable and demonstrates Labour&#39;s tolerance of wasteful spending, National’s Education spokesperson Erica Stanford says.</p>
<p>“In 2022 the Ministry of Education spent more than $10 million dollars on contractors to fill temporary positions despite the Ministry employing an extra 1,500 staff since 2017.</p>
<p>“This is a shameful use of taxpayer money that speaks to a culture of waste that has developed under Labour.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#39;s worse is almost all of this spending was on backroom roles that have nothing to do with the Ministry&#39;s core role of supporting schools to provide a world-class education to Kiwi kids.</p>
<p>“More than $2.8 million was spent on admin staff, $1.7 million on advisors and more than $820,000 on personal and executive assistants.</p>
<p>“The use of contractors to fill roles should only ever be a last resort to cover essential positions and this excessive use of contractors is clearly unacceptable while Kiwi households are having to tighten their own budgets.</p>
<p>“Schools are crying out for more resources to give students the education they deserve, but despite more than $5 billion of extra spending in the last six years, the money just isn&#39;t making it to teachers and students on the front line.</p>
<p>“A National government would ensure every taxpayer dollar spent improves outcomes for New Zealanders and every young person receives a world-class education that gives them opportunities to lead a successful life.”</p>
