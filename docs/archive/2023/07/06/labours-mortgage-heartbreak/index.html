<p><strong>Thursday, 6 July 2023, 2:51 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>New polling shows Labour’s economic mismanagement is wreaking havoc on New Zealanders, with tens of thousands being forced to consider selling their home, National’s Finance spokesperson Nicola Willis says.</p>
<p>HorizonPoll’s <em>Banking Monitor</em> released today shows that 11 per cent of those surveyed - equivalent to nearly 150,000 Kiwis with a mortgage - will ‘most likely’ or ‘definitely’ have to sell a residential property in the next 12 months because of higher interest rates.</p>
<p>“This poll shows that Labour’s economic mismanagement is shattering the Kiwi dream of homeownership.</p>
<p>“Recent first-home buyers are being hit hard – with one in four of those surveyed under the age of 35 expecting they will ‘definitely’ or ‘most likely’ have to sell in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>“Labour’s inability to control its own spending has pushed up interest rates. It is spraying money around with reckless abandon, and Kiwis are paying the price.</p>
<p>“As New Zealanders are re-fixing their mortgages on far higher rates, it’s like a bomb going off and they are being caught in the blast.</p>
<p>“Prime Minister Chris Hipkins had an opportunity to provide tax relief in his Budget, but failed to act, ignoring those struggling to pay the bills.</p>
<p>“Labour has found billions of dollars for its unwanted Three Waters reforms and for more Wellington consultants yet claim it can’t find a cent for tax relief.</p>
<p>“National will reduce income tax, bring discipline to government spending, stop adding new costs, fix worker shortages, and focus the Reserve Bank on controlling inflation.”</p>
