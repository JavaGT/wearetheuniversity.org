<p><strong>Monday, 24 July 2023, 2:15 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The new Justice Minister’s first action should be to abandon Labour’s target to reduce the prison population by 30 per cent, National’s Justice spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>“This Government’s soft approach to crime has failed, and the new Minister’s priority has to be reversing the 33 per cent increase in violent crime we have seen under Labour.</p>
<p>“That starts with removing the target of reducing the prison population.</p>
<p>“Whoever the new Justice Minister is would do well to consider the suite of law-and-order policies that National has announced to keep Kiwis safer.</p>
<p>“National will ensure that there are serious consequences for serious crime. National will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit the sentence discounts that judges can apply</li>
<li>Restore Three Strikes</li>
<li>End the taxpayer funding of cultural reports</li>
</ul>
<p>“Labour’s target to reduce the prison population, combined with no restrictions on judges’ ability to reduce sentences and taxpayer funding of written cultural reports, has weakened the consequences convicted criminals face.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders are sick of hearing excuses for criminal offending that inflicts harm on victims and terrorises communities.</p>
<p>“Not only does Labour need to be tougher on crime, but they also need to be tougher on the causes of crime.</p>
<p>“School attendance and achievement are appallingly low, fewer prisoners receive proper rehabilitation and thousands of children are growing up in motels.</p>
<p>“A National government will restore law and order by making public safety the top priority of the criminal justice system.”</p>
