<p><strong>Monday, 24 July 2023, 11:20 am</strong><br><strong>Speech: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><em>New Zealand First Convention</em><br><em>Rt. Hon Winston<br>Peters</em><br><em>2pm Sunday 23rd 2023</em><br><em>Mt Smart<br>Stadium</em><br><em>Eastern Lounge</em></p>
<p>Ladies and<br>Gentlemen. Thank you for being here, at New Zealand<br>First’s campaign launch.</p>
<p>81 days before Election<br>Day, 69 days before Early Voting begins and 64 days before<br>Overseas Voting starts, we meet here on a mission to save<br>our country.</p>
<p>No doubt you’re thinking to yourself<br>‘what’s in it for me?’. Given the other party slogans<br>already out there, and one in particular, that is a very<br>good question.</p>
<p>This election must be about the<br>economy. Because every issue inevitably comes back to what<br>we must do and how we pay for it. And there’s the rub,<br>because so many of the political promises of other parties<br>being made have no chance of ever being kept.</p>
<p>Why?<br>Well, if those parties have never delivered what they<br>campaigned on in better times, they certainly won’t<br>deliver on them in troubled times.</p>
<p>Remember Henry<br>Ford’s words – ‘You can’t build a reputation on what<br>you’re going to do’. Henry Ford built cars that ordinary<br>people could afford. Right? All manner of politicians today<br>are promising you a faster horse.</p>
<p>The critical issues<br>for this election are our economy and cost of living crisis,<br>our broken health system, our lack of law and order, our<br>failing education system, and the cost of housing and<br>rentals.</p>
<p>But if these five areas of crisis are not<br>enough already, our very democracy is at risk from a rising<br>tide of racism and separatism, that has given birth to<br>secret social engineering that you were never warned about<br>and most certainly never agreed to.</p>

<p>What’s the<br>evidence for this? It’s the Prime Minister’s bonfire<br>after he got the job - but the bonfire was for the paper<br>back copies of Labour’s books, whilst they are saving the<br>hard bound copies for after the election.</p>
<h2>Vehicle<br>Change</h2>
<p>It is clear that a great majority of New<br>Zealanders, including many Labour voters, don’t want more<br>of the same. They are hard up against it, with rising costs<br>everywhere, and no money left over after buying the<br>essentials.</p>
<p>This majority rightfully expect to have a<br>voice, yet Wellington is clearly not listening. New<br>Zealanders are sick of all the changing definitions of<br>economic and personal income security, and a vacuous goal of<br>‘wellbeing’, whatever that means. They know that they<br>are forgotten New Zealanders slogging it out in difficult<br>jobs and they ask – “where is the promise, where is the<br>hope, where is the commitment that if we work, save, and be<br>good citizens then tomorrow will be better for<br>us”.</p>
<p>And remember many of New Zealand’s present<br>day well off started as workers. Very few of them inherited<br>their wealth, and malignant envy is no way to level up<br>society. There must be rewards for sweat, tears, sacrifice,<br>and savings. Many of us, and them, do remember from personal<br>experience what poverty smells, tastes, and feels<br>like.</p>
<p>Our country’s economic and social malaise did<br>not happen overnight, but it’s got dramatically worse in<br>just 33 months.</p>
<p>Too many of our young have no memory<br>of when our country was a world leader, in health and<br>education, and house ownership, and personal income the envy<br>of nearly every other country. Let’s be honest, we have<br>not delivered for them what our parents delivered for<br>us.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, if we don’t change<br>direction we are certain to end up where we are going -<br>down. So, be careful about the promises politicians make in<br>this campaign, and ask this question – if their policies<br>work, then why didn’t they work the last time they had<br>power? Remember, ‘if you’re in the desert a mirage can<br>be fatal’.</p>
<p>The next government must have real<br>answers for problems economic and social, and not some<br>ideological experiment where you and our country are the<br>guinea pigs. Please ask, when and where did their policies<br>ever work?</p>
<p>New Zealand has not paid its way since<br>1972. We must have policies in 2023 to grow, earn, and pay<br>our way in to the future. Not overnight because that is<br>impossible but improving year on year as other first world<br>nations, once way behind us, now way ahead of us, have<br>done.</p>
<h2>New Zealand’s Gifted Inheritance</h2>
<p>We<br>have the resources, and we work the second longest hours in<br>the OECD, so it can’t be the worker’s fault. The fault<br>line of failure leads to Wellington, and we are going to<br>have to fix that right here, right now.</p>
<p>How few<br>commentators said a year ago that New Zealand is heading for<br>a recession? Less than the fingers on one hand. Not strange<br>really because most of these touted experts work for banks,<br>foreign owned banks - and fake confidence is the reason for<br>their existence.</p>
<p>Today many commentators say we are<br>‘broke’. But what they never say is we’re broke of<br>ideas and polices to fix this country’s economy, and<br>dramatically improve our national income and social<br>performance. And what some of these experts don’t like, is<br>being reminded that when we were number one in the world<br>most of the politicians then had never been to university.<br>They gaslight such success as “nostalgia”.</p>
<p>Longing<br>for a past that they say is no longer possible. Well, we say<br>it is possible again - but not with your<br>policies.</p>
<p>That’s why when we look abroad, we see<br>countries that have modernised following the script that<br>once made us a world leader. Once poor countries like<br>Singapore, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Ireland and an Island<br>called Taiwan, transformed their economies to become wealth<br>creators, maximising added value before exporting,<br>maximising IT to assist wealth creation, providing great<br>health systems and educating their people to the max, and<br>knowing they could only get there with high wage economies -<br>as we once did.</p>
<p>And they all have three more<br>features:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have taxation policies that assist<br>businesses and workers, not unfairly hinder<br>them,</li>
<li>They have disciplined populations, many with a<br>police ratio to population less than ours, but far less<br>crime, and</li>
<li>They regard their people as human capital<br>where expenditure is necessary investment, not wasteful<br>cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so did we once, when Parliament was<br>full of practical people, not university union politicians<br>who wouldn’t know a real worker if they fell over one, and<br>don’t know how to fill out a simple ‘profit and loss’<br>account, or ‘pecuniary interest form’.</p>
<p>If you want<br>to know who are the most forgotten people in New Zealand<br>today, it is the kiwi worker – and New Zealand First has<br>always cared for them.</p>
<h2>New Zealand’s Broken Health<br>System</h2>
<p>When we formed New Zealand First 30 years ago,<br>one of our founding principles was ‘that expenditure on<br>health, was an investment’ - our country’s human capital<br>needed to be healthy, and if sick, medically treated as fast<br>as possible.</p>
<p>In the next three years we are going to<br>set up a single health system – where need, not race, is<br>the priority.</p>
<p>To do that, we’re going to<br>reprioritise government expenditure, provide funding<br>increases for primary health care, and reassign wasted<br>resources to urgently deal with hospitals and waiting<br>lists.</p>
<p>We are going to stop $29 billion plus on<br>Auckland Light Rail which will not work, and spend it on<br>items like Emergency Departments and residential care for<br>the aged. And we are also going to use savings from wasteful<br>pet projects to get the specialist medical staff, so that<br>our medico-patient ratios are again first world, not third<br>world.</p>
<p>And we know that we will only get essential<br>frontline staff if we pay them properly – and pay them<br>properly we will.</p>
<p>And as a remit at our conference<br>yesterday said, Pharmac was set up so politicians could<br>dodge being held accountable. New Zealand First believes<br>that New Zealand has long had inferior first world<br>pharmaceutical delivery. All first world international<br>comparisons prove that, we are at the bottom of the OCED for<br>access to medicines, and the eight plus years delay to get<br>approvals is simply a national disgrace.</p>
<p>All the other<br>political parties believe in the Pharmac model, we don’t,<br>because we don’t believe in fobbing off political<br>responsibility.</p>
<p>So we are going to take money from<br>wasteful expenditure, to provide innovative lifesaving<br>medicines quickly, and provide timely access to patients to<br>developed high cost treatments.</p>
<p>We are going to<br>provide the new model an extra $1.3 billion on top of the<br>present $1.2 billion “existing underbudget”.</p>
<p>New<br>Zealand First is the “Health Party”.</p>
<h2>New<br>Zealand’s Failing Education System</h2>
<p>There is much<br>going wrong with our education system.</p>
<p>Education<br>Minister Tinetti was recently crowing about student<br>attendance rising to 60%. It didn’t occur to her, for that<br>to happen the best schools must be at least 90% and the<br>worse schools for attendance at 30%. That’s 60,000 plus<br>truant pupils in any given day, a tsunami of educational<br>failure at a personal and national level and billions of<br>wasted taxpayers’ dollars.</p>
<p>New Zealand First’s<br>policy is to fix that, as common-sense politicians once did,<br>as long ago as 1877 when they made education<br>compulsory.</p>
<p>We will not get back to having a leading<br>economy without first fixing our education system.</p>
<p>We<br>were at the very top of the education world once. And we<br>didn’t get there with some of the stupid education<br>policies we have today.</p>
<p>But once we have properly<br>trained our young, we must pay our workforce competitive<br>incomes to keep them here.</p>
<p>New Zealand taxpayers are<br>paying a fortune to train too many young people who then go<br>overseas and benefit, for free, some foreign<br>economy.</p>
<p>New Zealand First has nothing against an<br>“OE” (Overseas Experience).</p>
<p>But New Zealand First<br>is most certainly against “OF” – that is, a skilled<br>workforce “Overseas Forever”.</p>
<p>New Zealand First is<br>the “Education Party”.</p>
<h2>Taxation – Towards An<br>Export Power House</h2>
<p>It is said that there are only two<br>things certain in life - “death and taxes”.</p>
<p>If we<br>look at our once great past, and today’s ‘small country<br>economic world leaders’, they have one thing in common -<br>they are export power houses - like New Zealand once was.<br>Iceland, Norway, Finland, Singapore, and Ireland are small<br>countries maximising added value before exporting,<br>maximising IT, maximising education, and ensuring that they<br>pay their workforce high wages.</p>
<p>And we must again<br>follow that prescription with taxation policies that assist<br>that outcome.</p>
<p>That’s why we are going to bring in<br>tax incentives, to promote added value before exports, IT,<br>and productivity.</p>
<p>That’s why we are going to ensure<br>that the tax income brackets are adjusted to inflation. That<br>is New Zealand First’s policy.</p>
<p>We know we can both<br>lower taxation on business and give higher wages for<br>workers, with our polices to rapidly double our Gross<br>National Product.</p>
<p>And for those that say it can’t be<br>done, we point to countries like Singapore to refute their<br>myopic ideological mindset. We will announce details over<br>the next two months.</p>
<p>In this cost of living crisis, we<br>are going to Exempt Basic Foods, like fresh food,<br>vegetables, meat, dairy, and fish, from GST.</p>
<p>We<br>challenge the tax purists, to explain why other First World<br>countries can do this, and we can’t.</p>
<p>New Zealand<br>First is the “Sound Economics Party”.</p>
<h2>Law and<br>Order</h2>
<p>Three days ago in Auckland, sadly, two innocent<br>victims lost their lives, police officers were injured, and<br>ten others were hospitalised. The offender was shot by the<br>police - a tragedy for his family.</p>
<p>What’s going<br>wrong with law and order in this country is best described<br>by the Police Commissioner’s comment who said that the<br>offender - ‘had not breached his Home Detention<br>conditions’.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, he got hold of a<br>shotgun and right there was a massive breach. And if we<br>can’t understand as a country what constitutes illegal<br>behaviour, then we are destined to see it repeated over and<br>over again.</p>
<p>But even worse, how did someone sentenced<br>for choking someone almost to death receive just five months<br>home detention?</p>
<p>How was he able to get home detention<br>and access to a firearm if he was assessed as being “a<br>threat to others”?</p>
<p>Our courts are failing us with<br>these soft sentences that put community safety last, and<br>offender’s rights and excuses first.</p>
<p>These judicial<br>failures need an inquiry - just like all those police<br>officers who now have to be stood down and questioned just<br>because they did their job and shot someone who was shooting<br>at innocent people and them.</p>
<p>We want justice and<br>common sense returned to our country.</p>
<p>New Zealand<br>First’s says anyone who is a threat to the safety of our<br>community shouldn’t be on our streets.</p>
<p>Ladies and<br>gentlemen, the other parties are shouting ‘law and<br>order’, much like a drunk person leaning against an<br>evening lamppost at night – for support not illumination.<br>All the other parties on the right, had a policy of ‘catch<br>and warn’, and on the left, have a policy of ‘catch and<br>release’.</p>
<p>They have a record of having frozen police<br>budgets, closed over thirty police stations, and cutting<br>frontline police numbers.</p>
<p>How is that being ‘tough<br>on crime’?</p>
<p>Only one Party has a record of investing<br>in our police – New Zealand First. We got a massive<br>increase in frontline police numbers, not once but twice,<br>when we were in government. And on law and order we are the<br>only party whose promises you can trust – not on what we<br>say but on what we have done.</p>
<p>New Zealand First<br>will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Designate gangs as terrorist organisations<br>– like Western Australia and Queensland;<br>and</li>
<li>Establish a dedicated gang prison to minimise<br>prison recruitment of non gang members.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most<br>importantly, to address the causes of crime we have policies<br>to address real needs – such as enforcing compulsory<br>education, making housing including public housing<br>affordable for ordinary families, make health care available<br>for people who need it, and getting people, who have spent<br>years on the dole, back to work.</p>
<p>And something else.<br>Crime, whether its “gang collar, blue collar or white<br>collar”, we will treat the same. New Zealand First is the<br>only party that has had the courage over the decades to<br>expose white collar crime when the rest would<br>not.</p>
<p>Remember the vitriol that has come our way from<br>the establishment when we said white collar crime is going<br>on and we are going to prove to you what is happening –<br>and prove that to you we did.</p>
<p>New Zealand First is the<br>“Law and Order Party”.</p>
<h2>The Attack On Our<br>Democracy - Separatism</h2>
<p>The first New Zealand election<br>was in 1854, Māori voting was added in 1867, and women got<br>the vote in 1893.</p>
<p>As Abraham Lincoln said,<br>“Democracy is government of the people, by the people, for<br>the people”. That means one person, one vote, and every<br>vote of equal value.</p>
<p>Secretly, before 2020 and after,<br>the Labour, Greens, and Māori Party have launched a<br>full-scale attack on the essence of<br>democracy.</p>
<p>Ordinary Māori want safe affordable homes,<br>ready access to health care, educational escalators for<br>their young, and first world wages. That is what all<br>ordinary New Zealanders want, and it’s those four policies<br>that New Zealand First is committed to delivering on – no<br>matter what race you are, what church you are, what gender<br>you are.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in her insightful speech Casey<br>Costello set out the numerous racist attacks on our<br>democracy.</p>
<p>And the revisionists agenda is to force all<br>government and quasi-government agencies into<br>compliance.</p>
<p>Ordinary Māori never asked for any of<br>this. Only the elite Māori have.</p>
<p>There is no historic<br>justification for them, which is why they have set out to<br>re-write and reconstruct history.</p>
<p>To get to where<br>these politicians want to take us, they deal in lies,<br>including these four claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>That European<br>arrival ruined the peaceful paradise of Māori,</li>
<li>That<br>the Treaty saw Māori begin a partnership with Queen<br>Victoria,</li>
<li>That the Treaty was not about Māori<br>ceding sovereignty,</li>
<li>That the Treaty meant Māori<br>‘self-government’</li>
</ul>
<p>Stop for a moment and ask<br>yourself, whether you’re Māori or non-Māori, can any of<br>those four statements be remotely true?</p>
<ul>
<li>Every Iwi<br>history of the inter-tribal wars makes the ‘Māori Garden<br>of Eden’ a complete myth. Look at the local Māori history<br>here.</li>
<li>If no one in Britain or the UK or the whole<br>British Empire was in partnership with the Crown on the 5th<br>of February 1840, then how could it be constitutionally true<br>that Māori were, two days later?</li>
<li>The fact is Māori<br>ceded sovereignty to the Crown when they signed the Treaty.<br>The Chiefs back then said so, as did many leading Māori<br>later, including Sir Apirana Ngata, Sir Maui Pomare, and Sir<br>Peter Buck. Yet today’s elite power-hungry Māori and<br>their cultural fellow travelers deny history and<br>fact.</li>
<li>All Māori Iwi pre-1840 and well after, were<br>under the control of their ‘Tino Rangatiratanga’. That<br>means their Chief’s word was gospel. If there was back<br>then co-government, which Chief’s word, if different, was<br>gospel?</li>
</ul>
<p>The elite’s argument does not stand<br>the slightest scrutiny. And every ordinary Māori knows<br>it.</p>
<p>New Zealand First is the “One Standard of<br>Citizenship Party”.</p>
<h2>Social<br>Engineering</h2>
<p>Behind closed doors a small unelected<br>cabal of opinionated virtue signallers want to “integrate<br>gender content into the curriculum”. They want to stop the<br>science curriculum being about physics, chemistry, and<br>biology, but include sexual and gender education. They have<br>no authority to be doing this. They never ever asked<br>you.</p>
<p>This election is about stopping them.</p>
<p>The<br>government has no place in the nation’s bedrooms - so why<br>are our school children, from age five, now being taught<br>about ‘relationships, gender, and sexuality’?</p>
<p>New<br>Zealand First is going to restore education and stop<br>indoctrination.</p>
<p>New Zealand First is the “Common<br>Sense Party”.</p>
<h2>Caring For Seniors</h2>
<p>In our<br>country are about 890,000 people who are seniors, who<br>receive Super and enjoy the tens of thousands of shopping<br>benefits, plus free travel, that comes from the Gold<br>Card.</p>
<p>When over the years every political party has<br>attacked seniors and changed the law to harm their incomes,<br>one party alone has defended seniors.</p>
<p>In past times of<br>economic difficulty, the seniors have been the first one the<br>other parties have attacked.</p>
<p>New Zealand First will<br>makes sure, as in the past, they don’t succeed.</p>
<p>New<br>Zealand First is the “Standing Up For Seniors<br>Party”.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the last two days the<br>media have gone back to their 30-year-old question –<br>“who are you going to go with?” How many times must we<br>tell them that our record means we will never go with<br>parties that have racist policies. The last Party other<br>political parties want to talk to before Election Day is New<br>Zealand First, and the first Party they want to talk to -<br>the day after.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most<br>critical election in our lifetime.</p>
<p>Under MMP you have<br>two votes. One for a local electorate political Party<br>candidate, the other for the political Party of your choice;<br>the Party Vote. New Zealand First is asking for your Party<br>Vote - to keep them honest.</p>
<p>New Zealand is at an<br>inflection point and a change in government is critical. But<br>it must be for a much better government and not just<br>‘it’s our turn now’. You’re entitled to ask them<br>“your turn to do exactly what?”</p>
<p>And one thing that<br>the last three years has proven is that certainty, common<br>sense, and experience, is critical to good government. On<br>their own the Labour Party has proven an utter<br>mess.</p>
<p>And looking across the political divide ask<br>yourself this question, “Is this their first rodeo?”<br>Because for many it is. They have never had a Minister<br>inside of Cabinet. They will need our certainty, our common<br>sense, and our experience.</p>
<p>New Zealand First is a<br>Party for ordinary New Zealanders. We understand the<br>economic challenges and we don’t have extremist policies<br>that have never worked in the history of any<br>country.</p>
<p>New Zealand First is the insurance voters<br>need to avoid an ideological lurch in either<br>direction.</p>
<p>We are a Party that for thirty years has<br>put New Zealanders First. Certainty, Common Sense, and<br>Experience is desperately needed in New Zealand now, and<br>even more so after this coming election.</p>
<p>It’s with<br>that in mind that we ask you to get ready, to make a<br>commitment, right here right now, to save our<br>country.</p>
<p>If you do, the future is<br>certain.</p>
<p>Democracy will prevail.</p>
<p>But it is<br>‘Now or Never’.</p>
<p>We oppose racist<br>co-government.</p>
<p>We oppose their Three Waters take<br>over.</p>
<p>We oppose our country’s name being<br>changed.</p>
<p>We oppose separatism in policy and in<br>law.</p>
<p>We oppose this insidious woke agenda being driven<br>by an elite cabal of social and ideological<br>engineers.</p>
<p>We support policies - based on need, not<br>race.</p>
<p>We support the rule of law - where everyone is<br>equal before it.</p>
<p>We support the right of free speech -<br>and that means we support the right of New Zealanders to<br>say, ‘I disagree’ and not be mandated out of<br>existence.</p>
<p>We support the right of New Zealanders to<br>disagree with government policy and not be punished for<br>it.</p>
<p>And we are never going to work in Parliament with<br>any political party whose policies threaten those<br>fundamental rights.</p>
<p>We have watched over the last<br>three years Labour and its cohorts taking our country away<br>from us.</p>
<p>That’s why we are asking you to Party Vote<br>New Zealand First.</p>
<p>We’ve got the polices, the grit,<br>the experience, and the courage to stop them and rebuild New<br>Zealand.</p>
<p>We are asking you to join us,<br>and,</p>
<p>“Let’s Take Back Our<br>Country”.</p>
