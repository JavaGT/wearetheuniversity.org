<p>Instead of creating an appeal fund and one-off lotto draw, the Labour Government could tax the billions of dollars banks have made in unearned, excess profits and use the money to support people.</p>
<p>“Has the Government heard of tax? It’s simple: tax the banks; don’t work with them to set up an appeal fund,” says Green Party finance spokesperson Julie Anne Genter.</p>
<p>“The profit made by the Government’s chosen appeal fund partner, Westpac, hit a record $1.1 billion last year.</p>
<p>“While Westpac and other foreign-owned banks are generating record profits, thousands of families are being forced to make impossible choices about whether to pay the bills or put food on the table.</p>
<p>“Lotteries and gambling disproportionately also harm lower income communities.</p>
<p>“Launching the appeal fund, the Prime Minister said the Government was ‘giving wealthy people the opportunity to contribute’. There is a simpler opportunity: tax them fairly.</p>
<p>“The money we need to support each other is already there. An excess profit tax would be a simple and effective way to unlock the resources we need to support the people who need it the most.</p>
<p>“A 10% levy on the banking sector’s record profits would raise over half a billion dollars which could be used to support people.</p>
<p>“There are only political choices standing in the way of building the Aotearoa we need. Today the Government has made the wrong choice,” says Julie Anne Genter.</p>
