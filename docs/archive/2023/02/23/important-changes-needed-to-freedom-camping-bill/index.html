<p><strong>Thursday, 23 February 2023, 5:00 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National has pulled its support for the Self-Contained Motor Vehicles Legislation Bill until the Government treats all responsible freedom campers fairly, National’s Tourism spokesperson Todd McClay says.</p>
<p>“The Bill, as drafted, restricts freedom campers unless they have a fixed toilet in their vehicle. But the problem is not the type of toilets campers have – it’s whether or not they use them.</p>
<p>“Unless it’s re-drafted, this measure will unfairly punish the many responsible New Zealanders who have suitable non-fixed facilities, and use them regularly. It will impose unreasonable costs and unnecessarily restrict recreational activities.</p>
<p>“National supports stronger regulations for freedom camping. However, Labour’s decision will unfairly penalise almost 70,000 responsible campers, without stopping those who are polluting campsites.</p>
<p>“This legislation has been poorly drafted and needs fixing. Labour should not misuse its Parliamentary majority to pass a poorly-written law that will unfairly restrict thousands of responsible campers.</p>
<p>“Under this proposed law, a camper with a fixed toilet who doesn’t use it will not be breaking the law, yet a camper who uses a non-fixed toilet will be fined. This is crazy.</p>
<p>“Freedom campers should have to have a suitable toilet, and use it. Those who don’t, should be prosecuted.</p>
<p>“It’s disappointing that the new Tourism Minister, Peeni Henare, has rejected National’s offer of assistance, thereby potentially criminalising tens of thousands of responsible Kiwi campers.</p>
<p>“A National Government will make sure freedom camping is fair, and environmentally sustainable without unnecessary regulation and cost. We will propose changes in Parliament to Labour’s poor Bill.”</p>
