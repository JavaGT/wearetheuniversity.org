<p><strong>Tuesday, 21 February 2023, 10:54 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions">New Zealand Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand Council of Trade Unions was joined today by working people across the country to submit on a bill designed to provide additional protection for employees in small businesses.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_129964/health-and-safety-at-work-health-and-safety-representatives">The Health and Safety at Work (Health and Safety Representatives and Committees) Amendment Bill</a> would allow workers in small businesses greater access to health and safety representatives and committees.</p>
<p>Currently, small businesses of fewer than 20 workers in a low-risk sector do not have to hold elections for health and safety representatives. The bill makes it mandatory for all businesses to hold elections if workers request this.</p>
<p>The NZCTU strongly supports the intention of the Bill.</p>
<p>NZCTU National Secretary Melissa Ansell-Bridges said the Bill would help employees have a better say in their workplaces’ health and safety practices.</p>
<p>“It’s crucial that health and safety outcomes are improved in small businesses. By bringing stronger Worker Engagement, Participation, and Representation (WEPR), we can improve the wellbeing of thousands of working people.”</p>
<p>Ansell-Bridges said many workers in small industries did not feel safe speaking out about health and safety.</p>
<p>“These workers are often in closer proximity to management and are less likely to be represented by a union. This means there are fewer avenues of support available. This Bill will help remedy that situation.</p>
<p>“All businesses have a responsibility to deliver good health and safety outcomes regardless of their size.”</p>
<p>The NZCTU supports the additional recommendations in the Public Service Association’s submission, including a statutory register of health and safety representatives, and legislative support for ‘roving health and safety representatives.’</p>
