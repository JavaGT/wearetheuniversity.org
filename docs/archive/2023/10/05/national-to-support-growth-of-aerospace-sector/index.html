<p><strong>Thursday, 5 October 2023, 2:20 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>A National government will support the growth of New Zealand’s nascent aerospace sector, recognising its potential to boost New Zealand’s economy, National Leader Christopher Luxon says.</p>
<p>“National is committed to rebuilding the economy, bringing down the cost of living, and delivering tax relief so that New Zealanders can get ahead. High-tech, high skills sectors such as aerospace offer an incredible opportunity to lift wages and help grow the economy.</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s commercial aerospace industry employs 12,000 people and contributes $1.7 billion to the economy. New Zealand is one of only 11 countries with active launch-to-orbit capability, with Rocket Lab launching more than 30 times from the Mahia Peninsula.</p>
<p>“National is ambitious for New Zealand’s space and advanced aviation industries, which are already delivering benefits through employment, research, international connections and prestige.</p>
<p>“Space also has the potential to drive greater interest in science and technology among school students and help reverse the slide in New Zealand’s education outcomes.</p>
<p>“However, New Zealand faces the real risk of losing its hard-won competitive advantages in aerospace due to excessive bureaucracy and increasing competition from other countries, including Australia.</p>
<p>“That’s why National is today announcing our plans for space and advanced aviation in New Zealand with our Unleashing New Horizons policy.”</p>
<p>National will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Appoint a Minister for Space to promote space and advanced aviation in New Zealand and improve the performance of regulators</li>
<li>Establish an annual Prime Minister’s Space Prize for the top school student in aerospace-related subjects to help boost interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths education</li>
<li>Welcome highly-skilled migrants to work in aerospace with fast-track visas including a pathway to residency</li>
<li>Establish two dedicated testing zones for space and aerospace, in addition to the site at Kaitorete near Christchurch</li>
<li>Improve satellite data procurement and sharing between government agencies so we’re not wasting taxpayers’ money by paying for the same sets of satellite images more than once.</li>
</ul>

<p>“National knows how important a growing economy is to bring down the cost of living, and to underpin every New Zealanders’ standard of living. Another three years of reckless spending by a Labour-led government would be disastrous for the economy.</p>
<p>“People who want change should go out today and give their party vote to National to get a government that will manage the economy well so every New Zealander can get ahead.”</p>
