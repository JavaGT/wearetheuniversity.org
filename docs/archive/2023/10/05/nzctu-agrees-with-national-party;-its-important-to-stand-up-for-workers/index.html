<p><strong>Thursday, 5 October 2023, 4:30 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions">New Zealand Council of Trade Unions</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Nicola Willis has today agreed with NZCTU analysis that shows less than 0.2% of New Zealand households will receive the advertised $252 a fortnight rate claimed by National.</strong></p>
<p>NZCTU President Richard Wagstaff also agreed with Willis, in her belief that the NZCTU must stand for working people.</p>
<p>“That is exactly why we won’t back anyone who wants to strip away Fair Pay Agreements from hundreds of thousands of New Zealand’s lowest paid workers.</p>
<p>“We won’t support anyone who wants to reintroduce 90-day trials – something the Treasury has shown doesn’t work and leads to insecurity and exploitation. We won’t support people who don’t support increases in the Minimum Wage”.</p>
<p>“We won’t support a tax plan that is balanced by taking $2 billion from 350,000 low-income New Zealanders on benefits. We won’t back a plan that relies on making thousands of public servants redundant and cutting essential public services. We won’t back a plan that takes $2 billion out of climate change action and puts it in the pockets of landlords.”</p>
<p>Wagstaff said he would love to see the National Party deliver policies and programmes that would genuinely support working people across New Zealand.</p>
<p>“But their proposed policies for the government would instead make life harder for working people right across Aotearoa.”
