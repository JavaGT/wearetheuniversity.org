<p>External harassment of staff. The VC reported this week that in 2021 the University commissioned an independent safety and security audit and report that has now been submitted by Quantum Security Services, and that their recommendations for reducing risk and keeping staff safe from external harassment online have now been accepted. Read more about the report and actions taken here<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/notices/2023/quantum-report-staff-facing-external-harassment.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/notices/2023/quantum-report-staff-facing-external-harassment.html</a>. For good reasons, we remain agnostic. We will consult with those of our members who have direct experience and invite confidential communications from members with a direct interest in any aspect of this issue.</p>
<p>Ms Information. Relatedly, we encourage members and staff generally to view the documentary on the abuse, harassment (and worse) to which TEU member and colleague Siouxsie Wiles has been subjected for doing her job: meticulous science shared in the public interest during the COVID years. Siouxsie now says that the vilification “is worse than it has ever been… Jacinda Ardern, Kate Hannah [ex-UoA, now of the Misinformation Project], and I are the three most hated people in the country right now.” The documentary is called Ms Information. Trailer: Siouxsie The Movie | A Documentary by Gwen Isaac<a href="https://www.siouxsiethemovie.co.nz/">https://www.siouxsiethemovie.co.nz/</a>. It was part of the film festival in August and is going on general release at some cinemas around the country on the 26 October. There will be a screening at the Rialto in Newmarket next week (17:45 Tues 17 October) with Q+A with the director.

<p>Working Students Aotearoa. A group of students based at UoA called Working Students Aotearoa (WSA) has reached out to your UoA TEU Branch Committee. They are interested educating and supporting students in exercising their rights as workers, discussing union organising strategies and normalising union membership. It is great to see students being proactive in employment rights and the branch committee is liaising with them on how to best support their endeavours. If you are a student who is interested in joining, or know someone who would be interested, email: <a href="mailto:workingstudentsaotearoa@gmail.com">workingstudentsaotearoa@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>Messing up a good thing. The Participatory Science Platform (PSP), which was funded by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), aimed to help three different communities – South Auckland, Taranaki and Otago – engage in science. But it has been quietly canned. A few insiders know why but they aren’t saying.

<p>Inaugural lecture. TEU member Professor Frédérique Vanholsbeeck&#39;s inaugural lecture, What is a real physicist?, will focus on the physics behind monitoring bacteria viability using fluorescence and microfluidics as well as understanding osteoarthritis using optical coherence tomography. She will also explain why physics and science are fun. 17 October, 6.30-7.30pm in Building 303, PLT1/G20.</p>

<p>Reminders:</p>

<li>Pay Equity. The TEU pay equity claim for administrative and library staff is active. This claim has the potential to affect as many as 900 UoA staff members. We are now moving into a new phase of the claim, where member involvement is very important. If you’ve received an email from TEU administrator Lucy Fowler about your role, make sure you’ve replied! If you are interested in more information, email Nicole or Lucy:  <a href="mailto:nicole.wallace@teu.ac.nz">nicole.wallace@teu.ac.nz</a> or <a href="mailto:lucy.fowler@teu.ac.nz">lucy.fowler@teu.ac.nz</a>.</li>
<li>TEU office hours.  Our organisers, Nicole and Andy, will be running open office hours on the City Campus every Friday from 10am till 2pm, in the TEU Office, Room 417, Level 4 of the Fisher Building (Building 804, 18 Waterloo Quadrant).
