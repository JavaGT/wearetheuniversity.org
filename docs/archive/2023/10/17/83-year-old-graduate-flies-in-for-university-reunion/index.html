<p><strong>Tuesday, 17 October 2023, 9:57 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>An 83-year-old is travelling from Canada to attend a weekend of 150th anniversary alumni celebrations at his former university in Christchurch. Dr John Gray, who lives in Victoria, British Colombia started studying at what is now Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury (UC), in 1959 - 64 years ago.</p>

<p>Initially a theology student, Dr Gray planned to become a minister, but he ended up graduating with a master’s degree and then a Diploma in Clinical Psychology.</p>
<p>“My time at UC had a huge impact on my life,” he says. “If had stayed on my original path I probably would have been a parish priest somewhere. But my vocational goals changed, and my studies set me up for a different career. I also met my wife Elizabeth while we were both students. We still have wonderful friends who we studied with in the Clinical Psychology programme.”</p>
<p>Dr Gray left New Zealand in 1966, a year after graduating, and went on to carve out a distinguished career in the field of mental health in Canada. He usually makes a return visit to New Zealand every two years but decided to come back earlier than planned so he could join the upcoming University of Canterbury Alumni and Community Weekend, 27 - 29 October.</p>

<p>“I’m getting a little bit older, and my brother and lots of my friends are here, so I thought, ‘Why not come back sooner?’,” Dr Gray says.</p>
<p>He remembers having a lot of fun during his years as a UC student. “It was so different from my time at high school in Whanganui. It was exciting and a challenge and there was a lot of learning - more than just book learning.</p>
<p>“I was in College House hall for three years and it was a great experience, very social. We had meals together and we had fresher days. There were lots of sporting activities.”</p>
<p>Dr Gray says studying at UC opened his mind to new possibilities and he enjoyed the challenging practical work experiences he had during his Clinical Psychology diploma.</p>
<p>UC Amokapua | Assistant Vice-Chancellor Engagement Brett Berquist says the Community and Alumni Weekend is one of many events celebrating the University’s 150th anniversary this year and will be a great chance for people to reunite with classmates and friends.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to welcome back alumni from abroad, like John, as well as from across NZ. In particular, we invite the Christchurch community to take a look at the many events we have planned - lectures, lab tours, booths explaining our research into the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, music, and, most importantly, good food.”</p>
<p>Graduates and members of the community are encouraged to register for any of the nearly 50 events over the weekend. The weekend will wrap up with a community picnic at the University.</p>
<p>Dr Gray is now retired but his career in Canada included being the director of a psychiatric hospital and director of the British Colombia mental health service. As a volunteer, he was the President of the Schizophrenia Society of Canada and the Secretary General of the International Association of Gerontology.</p>
<p>He still swims and goes walking regularly and returns to Aotearoa regularly to attend the New Zealand Masters Games.</p>
<p>UC’s Alumni and Community Weekend is being held at the Ilam Campus from Friday October 27 to October 29. All activities are free but most require registration.</p>
