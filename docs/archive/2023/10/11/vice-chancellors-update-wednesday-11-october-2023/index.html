<p>This week is Macawa ni Vosa Vakaviti – Fijian Language Week, and the theme this year is ‘Me vakabulabulataki, vakamareqeti, ka vakaqaqacotaki na vosa vakaviti’, which means ‘Nurture, preserve and sustain the Fijian language’.</p>
<p>I would like to acknowledge the impact and concern caused by recent events in Israel and Palestine. The University has students and staff from Israel, Palestine and the wider Middle East region, who will rightly be concerned about their communities and whānau. A reminder that staff affected by the conflict can contact the Employee Assistance Programme <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/policy-hub/people-culture/employer-employee-responsibilities/employee-assistance-programme-eap-guidelines.html">EAP</a>, and that support for students is available from Te Papa Manaaki Campus Care<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/students/student-support/personal-support/te-papa-manaaki-campus-care.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/students/student-support/personal-support/te-papa-manaaki-campus-care.html</a>.</p>
<p>Completion of Quantum Report action points</p>
<p>In 2021 the University commissioned an independent safety and security audit and report. That report, prepared by Quantum Security Services, made a number of recommendations for reducing risk and keeping staff safe from external harassment online. I am pleased to confirm that all of the recommendations have now been completed. You can read more about the report and actions taken here<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/notices/2023/quantum-report-staff-facing-external-harassment.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/notices/2023/quantum-report-staff-facing-external-harassment.html</a>.</p>
<p>Taumata Rau Conversations</p>
<p>Next week the University is hosting the first in a series of panel conversations on issues relevant to Auckland and the wider country. The first event, at 5.30pm on Tuesday 17 October, will explore the future of the health system in Aotearoa New Zealand. It will be followed on Tuesday 24 October with a discussion on the country’s national and cyber security. You can learn more and register for the events on the website here<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/public-lectures/2023/taumata-rau-conversations.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/public-lectures/2023/taumata-rau-conversations.html</a>.</p>
<p>Polling booth on campus</p>
<p>A reminder that staff and students who wish to lodge their vote before election day on Saturday can do so at the polling booth located on Level 3 of the Kate Edger Information Commons, above the Quad. It is open today, Thursday and Friday from 10am to 4pm.</p>
