<p><strong>Monday, 9 October 2023, 9:56 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>As the University of Canterbury (UC) celebrates its 150th year, two historians will investigate medieval links in modern Ōtautahi Canterbury via a 600-year-old document.</p>
<p>The Canterbury Roll is a five-metre-long 15th century genealogical text. Created nearly six centuries ago, it was subsequently modified on a number of occasions in the course of the English civil war known as the Wars of the Roses.</p>
<p>Created in the late 1420s to early 1430s and purchased by the University of Canterbury in 1918, the Canterbury Roll remained difficult to access until its publication as a digitised edition by Canterbury University Press in 2017. Since then, it has become the focus of the Canterbury Roll Project, a joint venture between UC and Nottingham Trent University in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>On Monday 16 October, a free, livestreamed Tauhere UC Connect public lecture will focus on two strands of the ongoing investigation into the Roll, presented by two UC historians.</p>
<p>UC historian Dr Madi Williams (Ngāti Kuia, Ngāti Kōata) will explore concepts of place, space, and identity in Te Ao Māori (the Māori world) and the medieval world. Using the Roll as an example, she will discuss the synergies and divergences between these two worlds and their conceptions.</p>
<p>“These synergies can contribute to a new way of approaching the study of medieval history in New Zealand,” Dr Williams says.</p>
<p>UC historian Dr Chris Jones will examine the way the Roll has opened new doors on the exploration of similar documents in the United Kingdom. Much of this new scientific analysis has been carried out in partnership with Nottingham Trent University, and in 2022 it saw the team working on the Roll receive the UK’s Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education in Advancing Cultural Heritage Science.</p>
<p>“At the same time, new work is emerging on the significance of the Roll as a cultural artefact,” he says. “This ranges from re-assessments of how it was used to its treatment of Biblical history.”</p>
