<p>Staff satisfaction survey. The BusinessDesk has picked up on the troubling staff satisfactions survey results from a few months ago: Low staff satisfaction results<a href="https://businessdesk.co.nz/article/law-regulation/law-school-staff-unhappy-in-latest-survey">https://businessdesk.co.nz/article/law-regulation/law-school-staff-unhappy-in-latest-survey</a> (paywalled), or at least those specific to the Law School. These revealed that only 15% of staff in that faculty feel free to speak “without fear of any negative impact”.  We are aware of these results and will follow up with delegates and members in that faculty. However, as you realise, the survey results across the university highlighted a variety of worrisome issues. Freedom to speak is one element but so are workloads, advancement, communications, and managerial styles. Indeed, when members report not feeling free to speak without fear of repercussion, it is often tied to concerns about these other issues.</p>
<p>Progress in the disability space. Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington have released their refreshed Te Ara Taupuhipuhi- Disability Inclusion Action Plan 2023-2025<a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/about/governance/equity-diversity-and-inclusion/disability-inclusion">https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/about/governance/equity-diversity-and-inclusion/disability-inclusion</a>. These plans are recent requirements by the TEC and are having an observable positive impact on the rates of disability disclosure. VUW’s rate of students disclosing a disability was 10% of domestic enrollments in 2022. The University of Auckland attained an 8% student disclosure rate in 2022. This is in line with the national average rate of domestic student disclosure, and double our rate in 2019.
There are improvements in the staff space too: 6% of staff at the University of Auckland now feel comfortable disclosing a disability to the employer<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/equity-at-the-university/about-equity/a-safe--inclusive-and-equitable-university/disability-action-plan/disability-action-plan-annual-report.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/equity-at-the-university/about-equity/a-safe--inclusive-and-equitable-university/disability-action-plan/disability-action-plan-annual-report.html</a>. This is double the rate of staff disclosures from 2019, and while we still have improvements to make, a positive sign for both our workplace and the sector.</p>
