<p>On the election.

<p>Are you aware of the Achievement Relative to Opportunity policy?  If you have had circumstances that may have had a significant impact on your workplace participation, this policy is intended to “ensure a fair and equitable evaluation of achievement when personal circumstances have affected staff members’ participation in the workplace.”  These circumstances could be carer responsibilities, health and disability issues, cultural or community obligations, or unforeseen personal events.  Why might this be important to you?  “Employment-related decisions including appointments, access to career development and progression, and promotion will take into account the quality and impact of the individual’s achievements relative to the opportunities available to them and the effect personal circumstances may have had on those achievements.” If this policy might be of assistance to you, you can find the details at: <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/policy-hub/university-governance/equity/achievement-relative-opportunity-policy-procedures.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/policy-hub/university-governance/equity/achievement-relative-opportunity-policy-procedures.html</a></p>

<p>Did not see that coming. Student rent for university accommodation is going up by 8%: Te Waha Nui <a href="https://tewahanui.aut.ac.nz/culture/university-of-auckland-students-launch-campaign-against-campus-rent-hike">aut.ac.nz</a> and Auckland Uni students slam 8% accommodation rent hike <a href="https://www.1news.co.nz/2023/10/19/auckland-uni-students-slam-8-accommodation-rent-hike/">1news.co.nz</a>. We are also aware that Resident Advisors, live-in students who provide a variety of services to other students in UoA accommodation including pastoral care, have received new individual employment contracts. Having done the arithmetic, they believe that the employer is offering them worse terms than last year.</p>
<p>Ms. Information, reviewed. Branch committee member Christiane Rupp went to a screening and came away deeply impressed. “This incredible 2023 documentary directed by Gwen Isaac had its first screening this week at the Rialto. It captures the fear, misinformation, and anger that swept and divided the country during the Covid-19 pandemic while showcasing the independent voice of our colleague, microbiologist and science communicator Siouxsie Wiles fighting for the wellbeing of others. In doing so, Siouxsie became a punching bag for conspiracy theory movements across Aotearoa. Siouxsie is so much more than a successful scientist; she is ahead of her time, a leader. The real-world impact of her academic work is evident beyond Aotearoa’s borders. Siouxsie needs and deserves support from all of us. It is unacceptable that the harassment and threats she is still getting are not always taken seriously by those who could and should be there to support her. Don’t miss Ms. Information. It is in cinemas from 26 October.”</p>
<p>Humans of the BC. Prior to our recent AGM, Maribel Caballero (Group Services Team Leader for Business School – Graduate School of Management) stepped forward to serve as our branch Treasurer. She introduces herself: “I am a GenXer, and learned to be independent at a young age, and resourceful too especially during the hard times in our country. I am self-taught tech-savvy.  I love Matcha Green Tea and autumn is my favourite season...leaves falling, different shades and colours…sitting in a park/garden reading a book with a cuppa.”</p>
<p>The revolving door: politics, lobbying, politics. We already have co-governance: the elected government and the paid corporate lobbyists.
