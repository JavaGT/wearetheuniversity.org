<p>Semester Two examinations are now underway, and I want to start by acknowledging and thanking the many staff members across the University, notably the Assessment Services team, who have helped organise a busy exam schedule.</p>
<p>Taumata Rau Conversations</p>
<p>It was a privilege to host the second of our Taumata Rau Conversations on Tuesday evening, where we heard from some of the country’s leading cybersecurity experts on the risks and potential impacts of modern cyber threats in the context of New Zealand’s national security strategy. It followed the inaugural event last week on the future of the health workforce in Aotearoa New Zealand. You can read more about the two Conversations on our News pages here<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2023/10/18/taumata-rau-conversation-where-next-for-health-workforce.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2023/10/18/taumata-rau-conversation-where-next-for-health-workforce.html</a> and here<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2023/10/26/cybersecurity-taumata-rau.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2023/10/26/cybersecurity-taumata-rau.html</a>.</p>

<p>Celebrating Research Excellence</p>
<p>Congratulations also to all our researchers honoured at the 2023 Celebrating Research Excellence presentation last week. The theme of this year’s event was ‘Hīkina kia Tutuki, Rise to Meet the Challenge’, and it recognised outstanding work from doctoral candidates to the most senior researchers.

<p>End of Year Closedown</p>
<p>The University will close on Friday 22 December 2023 and re-open on Wednesday 3 January 2024. For most staff, this means the last day of work will be Thursday 21 December 2023 with the first day back to work being Wednesday 3 January 2024. As per usual practice, the HR system will automatically deduct your leave for the closedown period. Now is a good time to start thinking about applying for any other leave outside of this closedown period in agreement with your manager. More information is available on the staff intranet here<a href="https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/human-resources/your-hr/leave/christmas-new-year.html">https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/human-resources/your-hr/leave/christmas-new-year.html</a>.</p>
