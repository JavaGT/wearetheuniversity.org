<p><strong>Monday, 2 October 2023, 11:13 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Free_Speech_Union">Free Speech Union</a></strong></p>
<p>An internal University of Auckland survey has once again confirmed concerns that the Free Speech Union has raised for several years: academic freedom is under fire in New Zealand. This is a serious issue, but our leaders have their hands in the sand. We must be willing to face &#39;groupthink&#39; and denounce its proponents, says Jonathan Ayling, Chief Executive of the Free Speech Union.</p>
<p>&quot;Today, <em>BusinessDesk</em> journalists Victoria Young and Oliver Lewis reported very low scores on a range of issues in a survey leaked to them. Responding to the statement, &#39;I feel able to respectfully voice my views without fear of any negative impact&#39;, <strong>only 15%</strong> of academic staff in the law school agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;The summary of the University of Auckland survey itself notes &#39;Academic staff responses are unfavourable and statistically unfavourable in regards to respectfully voicing their view.</p>
<p>&quot;Inexplicably, the Tertiary Education Union, the outfit responsible for representing university staffs&#39; interests and voices, refused to comment on these results. A university spokeswoman claimed &#39;the survey results for the Law School reflect broad trends across the university.</p>
<p>&quot;These results are even lower than the results from this year&#39;s Free Speech Union Academic Freedom Survey, where <strong>only 46%</strong> of staff across all eight universities agreed they felt free to question received wisdom and state controversial and unpopular opinions.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Many responses in that survey referred to a &#39;climate of fear&#39; and a large number mentioned concerns about job security of barriers to promotion for expressing the &#39;wrong&#39; views. Across every metric, responses indicate academics feel less free than they did last year.</strong>   
 </p>
<p>&quot;Freedom in the university sector is stagnating, and its leaders either don’t know or don’t care. We need to pay attention and do something- our future is far more bleak without solutions, as disruptive or unexpected as they may be, that move us forward.&quot;
