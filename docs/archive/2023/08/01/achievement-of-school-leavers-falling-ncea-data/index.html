<p><strong>Tuesday, 1 August 2023, 3:57 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Ministry of Education data shows the percentage of school leavers attaining NCEA Level 2 has consistently fallen since Labour came to power, National’s Education spokesperson Erica Stanford says.</p>
<p>Last year, just 75 per cent of school leavers attained NCEA Level 2 or above– down from 81 per cent in 2017. Māori school leavers fared even worse with just 59 per cent attaining NCEA Level 2 or above – a drop of more than 10 percentage points.</p>
<p>“Since Labour came to power, the educational achievement of our high school students has plummeted, erasing years of improvement under the last National Government,” Ms Stanford says.</p>
<p>“According to the OECD, NCEA Level 2 is the minimum qualification young people need for successful labour-market participation. Sadly, the Labour Government’s misguided approach to education has meant an increasing number of students not reaching this level.</p>
<p>“Education has the power to change lives, but we won’t lift achievement in New Zealand by continuing to do the same things that are taking us backwards.</p>
<p>“Lifting achievement and keeping students engaged in education starts with ensuring that young people can do the basics brilliantly, and that is what National is focused on.</p>
<p>“A National Government will ensure every child receives a world-class education so when they leave school, they can lead the life they want.”</p>
<p>National’s plan to Teach the Basics Brilliantly will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that primary and intermediate students spend an hour on average on reading, writing, and maths every day.</li>
<li>Set minimum requirements for what schools must teach every year in reading, writing, maths and science.</li>
<li>Implement regular standardised assessment with clear reporting to parents.</li>
<li>Deliver better training and more tools to support teachers.</li>
</ul>
