<p><strong>Tuesday, 8 August 2023, 11:00 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>New analysis reveals that young people who are behind in maths go on to earn significantly less than their peers, National’s Education spokesperson Erica Stanford says.</p>
<p>“Every numeracy level attained equates to a nine per cent increase in future earnings, according to a report from the Royal Society commissioned by this Government.</p>
<p>“Based on average wages, that is equivalent to roughly $7,000 per year or $320,000 over a working life.</p>
<p>“Sadly, recent National Monitoring Study of Student Achievement data shows that just 42 per cent of Kiwi students in Year 8 are tracking to the curriculum level.</p>
<p>“The study also showed that the achievement of students in low decile schools is a shameful two and a half years behind their peers in high decile schools.</p>
<p>“A National government will tackle our falling standards and ensure every student has every opportunity to succeed and live the life they want.”</p>
<p>National’s plan to Teach the Basics Brilliantly will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that primary and intermediate students spend an hour on average on reading, writing, and maths every day.</li>
<li>Set minimum requirements for what schools must teach every year in reading, writing, maths and science.</li>
<li>Implement regular standardised assessment and clear reporting to parents.</li>
<li>Deliver better training and more tools to support teachers with teaching the basics.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Labour has made nothing but hollow promises in education. In his five years as Education Minister, Chris Hipkins presided over falling achievement, rock-bottom attendance levels, and growing inequalities between students in low and high-decile schools.</p>
<p>“Education has the power to change lives, but we won’t lift achievement in New Zealand by continuing to do the same things that are taking us backwards.</p>
<p>“National is committed to ensuring that 80 per cent of children are at or above the expected curriculum level for their age in reading, writing, maths and science by 2030.</p>
