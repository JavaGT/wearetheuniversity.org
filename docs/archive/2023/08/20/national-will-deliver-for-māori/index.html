<p><strong>Sunday, 20 August 2023, 1:39 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Māori should send Labour a strong message that it’s time for a change of government, National’s Māori Development spokesperson Tama Potaka says.</p>
<p>“Labour has no genuine record to run on when it comes to improving the lives of Māori over the past six years.</p>
<p>“Whānau Māori up and down the country are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis thanks to Labour’s economic mismanagement and failure to address soaring inflation.</p>
<p>“There are now 30 per cent more Māori on a benefit than when Labour came into office.</p>
<p>“Under Labour, around half of all Māori children are not attending school regularly, and one in four Māori students leave secondary school without any qualifications.</p>
<p>“This is a national embarrassment and a major indictment on Prime Minister Chris Hipkins as former Education Minister.</p>
<p>“Labour has also failed Māori on housing with Māori making half the 25,000 applicants on the Social Housing waitlist, which has quintupled since Labour took office 2017.</p>
<p>“The majority of people waking up in emergency housing and cars each day are also Māori.</p>
<p>“This is despite Labour’s $1 billion Whai Kāinga Whai Oranga Māori housing programme, which has delivered just 63 houses.</p>
<p>“National has a proud record of delivering for Māori. Under the Key/English government, more Māori kids were in school and achieving NCEA. National has settled nearly 70 per cent of all Treaty settlements.</p>
<p>“Voters have a clear choice this election. Chris Hipkins’ Coalition of Chaos or a strong and stable National government that will rebuild the economy, reduce the cost of living, and deliver better health and education for all New Zealanders.”</p>
