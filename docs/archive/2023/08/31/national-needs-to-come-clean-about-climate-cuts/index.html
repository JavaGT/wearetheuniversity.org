<p><strong>Thursday, 31 August 2023, 1:18 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The National Party needs to come clean about the impact of its plan to raid the climate budget and cancel $2 billion of investment in action to cut emissions.</p>
<p>“National’s plan to rip billions of dollars out of climate action in a climate emergency is dangerous and grossly irresponsible,” says the co-leader of the Green Party, James Shaw.</p>
<p>“National’s so-called ‘climate dividend’ is a sleight of hand designed to slow climate action. It’s climate denial dressed up as a tax cut. That’s it.</p>
<p>“I find it insulting, frankly, to the thousands of people who dedicate their lives to fighting for faster climate action. For the National Party to co-opt the language of climate action to justify delay is appalling.</p>
<p>“National’s plan is a climate change turbo-changed perfect storm of tax cuts for property speculators, rising rents and house prices, and climate inaction.</p>
<p>“On the very same day National said it planned to rip billions of dollars out of climate action, its coalition partner, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidseymourACT/videos/1300975477477348/">the ACT Party, said “there’s no point” reducing emissions</a>.</p>
<p>“National and ACT are as unscientific as they are dangerous - and they have proven themselves to be utterly out of touch with the needs of the people they claim to represent.</p>
<p>“I cannot think of a greater danger to our country than a National and ACT government. They are disingenuous, harmful and acting in bad faith.</p>

<p>“If National is going to play fast and loose with our future, they need to come clean about exactly what they are planning to cut from the climate budget.</p>
<p>“In the two years since I helped set it up, the Climate Emergency Response Fund has allocated over $4billion into action to reduce emissions, all of which has been raised directly from our biggest polluters.</p>
<p>“We already know National wants to double the price of catching the bus or train for people on the lowest incomes. What else is on the chopping block?</p>
<ul>
<li>New walking and cycling routes</li>
<li>Investment in clean, affordable renewable energy</li>
<li>Community energy projects</li>
<li>Improving the pay of bus drivers</li>
<li>Action to ensure the transition to a low carbon future is fair and equitable</li>
<li>Cutting emissions from carbon-intensive process heat</li>
<li>Māori climate action</li>
<li>Low- and zero-emissions buses</li>
<li>Reducing emissions from waste</li>
<li>Decarbonising freight transport</li>
</ul>
<p>“I set up the Climate Emergency Response Fund so money raised from our biggest polluters could be recycled into climate action. I will fight every step of the way to make sure National does not get its hands on it,” says James Shaw.</p>
