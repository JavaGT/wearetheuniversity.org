<p><strong>Sunday, 6 August 2023, 2:12 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour’s new fantasy of building light rail to Auckland’s North Shore, on top of the as-yet unclear plans to link the CBD to the airport, means the cost of its light rail plans will double to almost $60 billion, National’s Transport spokesperson Simeon Brown says.</p>
<p>“This is yet another desperate announcement by a Labour Government that has failed to deliver one major new transport project in their entire six years in office.</p>
<p>“Labour promised light rail to Mt Roskill by 2021 but has yet to deliver a single metre of track, even after spending more than $140 million on consultants.</p>
<p>“After six years of reports, promises, studies, consultations and announcements, Labour admitted this week it hasn’t even finished a business case for light rail to the airport. Transport Minister David Parker has no idea which route it will take. Aucklanders cannot ride on your ghost train Mr Parker.</p>
<p>“Rather than make those decisions, Labour is now promising to extend light rail to the North Shore. Labour has no idea how the plans will be funded, leaving a nearly $60 billion hole in its transport policy.</p>
<p>“When in government, National will look closely at the proposed tunnels across the Waitematā Harbour, as a second harbour crossing is a critical part of Auckland’s future.</p>
<p>“While Labour talks big on transport in Auckland, National has a track record of delivery. National delivered the Waterview Tunnel, Victoria Park Tunnel, electrified the Auckland rail network and started the City Rail Link.</p>

<p>“National has announced a significant transport plan for Auckland which builds on the success of the Northern Busway with busways planned for the North West, East, and a connection between the Airport and Botany, linking in with the existing rail network at Puhinui.</p>
<p>“National is supportive of additional vehicle lanes to Auckland’s North Shore to create a more resilient harbour connection.</p>
<p>“While Labour makes endless announcements, National delivers.”</p>
