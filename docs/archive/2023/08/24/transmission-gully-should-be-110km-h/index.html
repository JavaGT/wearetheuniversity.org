<p>“Motorists on Transmission Gully should be able to travel at the speed the road was engineered for,” says ACT’s Transport spokesperson Simon Court.</p>
<p>“Written Parliamentary Questions answered by the Minister of Transport confirm that Transmission Gully was engineered with a speed limit of 110 km/h in mind, but in order for this to be approved it needs to undergo a ‘speed management review’ from Waka Kotahi, who currently have no plans to undertake one.</p>
<p>“Labour has put seven times the length of New Zealand under speed management review in the past few years, but all they seem to want to do is lower limits.</p>
<p>“This is the rare example of a piece of modern roading infrastructure that can speed up Kiwis’ journeys. Waka Kotahi should be actively trying to have it used to its full potential.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t need to be this way. The Waikato Expressway is a great example of a road that supports a thriving economy and healthy communities - safe, efficient and with a 110km/h speed environment.</p>
<p>“ACT will keep standing up for Kiwis who have places to be and stuff to do. We need the country to grow, not go slow.”</p>
