<p>Tēnā koutou katoa</p>
<p>Medical Academics. The TEU, including member representative Jane Alsweiler, and the employer’s representatives met in mediation yesterday to try to resolve the disagreement about the employer&#39;s obligations under the Medical Academic Collective Agreement. The union’s position is that the employer is obliged to pay the increases agreed for other Academic staff members. The employer&#39;s position is that Medical Academic members are also required to accept other conditions that Academic members have accepted.</p>
<p>If the employer&#39;s position is correct, Medical Academic Staff will be required to accept terms and conditions which they have not negotiated and agreed in ordinary collective bargaining; for example, the removal of retirement gratuity for future members, or the future removal of any other terms and conditions for existing members.</p>
<p>This issue will now be going to the Employment Relations Authority. Members under this agreement should have received an email yesterday from our organiser, Nicole. If you have any questions, please contact her at <a href="mailto:nicole.wallace@teu.ac.nz">nicole.wallace@teu.ac.nz</a>.</p>
<p>Kāpuia kia tapatahi | Strong education and training together. A reminder that we think it worthwhile for members to attend pre-election meetings in local electorates and ask candidates for their views on the state of tertiary education. Parties appear to be giving the issue little concern, even though seven of our eight universities are forecasting deficits, staff salaries are not keeping pace with increases in the cost of living (and we risk a brain drain), and students are stressing more about survival than about studying. The TEU (with other education unions) has released the latest BERL report which reveals how comparatively poorly tertiary education is funded relative to members of the OECD [Aotearoa education spending out of step | Tertiary Education Union – Te Hautū Kahurangi o Aotearoa <a href="https://teu.ac.nz/news/aotearoa-education-spending-out-of-step/">teu.ac.nz</a>] This issue needs foresight on the part of politicians and warrants foregrounding in advance of the election.

<p>Relatedly: Free Voter Conversation Workshops. The NZ Council of Trade Unions is running free 1 hour online workshops for anyone who wants to learn how to have more effective conversations around voter turnout this election. For more info and to register go to <a href="https://election-conversations.lilregie.com/booking/attendees/new">https://election-conversations.lilregie.com/booking/attendees/new</a><a href="https://election-conversations.lilregie.com/booking/attendees/new">https://election-conversations.lilregie.com/booking/attendees/new</a>.</p>
<p>And more. TEC has released a 1 July 2023 Cabinet paper from Jan Tinetti on Risks to higher education capability or national provision<a href="https://tec.govt.nz/assets/Ministerial-papers/C-23-00625-Tertiary-Provision-and-Capabilities-in-Universities.pdf">https://tec.govt.nz/assets/Ministerial-papers/C-23-00625-Tertiary-Provision-and-Capabilities-in-Universities.pdf</a> due to proposed university cuts. Agencies identified no critical research capability concerns, and no areas where national provision is being completely lost (there is detailed analysis on pp. 6-8). Approval was sought for the Ministers of Education and Finance to make short-term changes to funding to enable collaboration in the delivery of at-risk provision.</p>
<p>The crisis deepens. VUW only slightly adjusts its plan to become smaller: &#39;Devastated&#39;: Victoria University axes 229 jobs and six courses <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-nz/news/national/devastated-victoria-university-axes-229-jobs-and-six-courses/ar-AA1h20pH?ocid=entnewsntp&cvid=1604060a2f8a4e0196bdfb6a0e944a1c&ei=8">msn.com</a> and Te Pūkenga is to slash further: 200 roles to go at Te Pūkenga following restructure process | Stuff.co.nz<a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/300974335/200-roles-to-go-at-te-pkenga-following-restructure-process">https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/300974335/200-roles-to-go-at-te-pkenga-following-restructure-process</a>.</p>
<p>Annual General Meeting. Next week, we have our AGM: 1pm, next Tuesday 26 September in 801.204 (Law School).  Lucy Fowler has sent a calendar invitation, along with nomination forms.  Please attend. And there will even be an opportunity for last-minute decisions to stand for the Branch Committee.  Members can stand for any role for which they feel suited and to which they can apply their energies, including as a member at large. Every branch role is up for relection every year. It is a one-year commitment. The branch committee meets monthly.  This is necessary work in the service of our members. We are organised, thorough, and focussed.</p>
<p>Endorsements and University committee elections. We received multiple requests for endorsements for the various upcoming committee (and Council) elections. In most cases, we had one TEU member seeking endorsement for one available position.  In some cases, we had more than one candidate seeking endorsement for a single opening on a committee/Council. It was the Branch committee’s position that we should endorse a single candidate, even if (as in these cases) both were excellent, in order to avoid later vote splitting which could result in neither being elected. Our Whip, Jennifer Frost, will be writing to all those who sought endorsement, announcing the results of our deliberations. Before voting is announced, we will advise members of our endorsements.</p>
<p>Consultation on the creation of Māori seats on Auckland Council. Members who live in Auckland may be interested in this consultation process initiated by Te Kaunihera o Tāmaki Makaurau / Auckland Council, who will decide in October 2023 whether to introduce Māori seats for the 2025 local elections. “This is about how Māori are represented in Auckland, and how Aucklanders are represented by their governing body. Before deciding, the council would like to hear and consider the views and preferences of Māori and the wider public of Auckland. Auckland Council currently has a set number of 20 elected general ward councillors (seats) with no provision for elected Māori seats.” You have two days more to comment at: <a href="https://akhaveyoursay.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/maori-seats/survey_tools/feedback-form">https://akhaveyoursay.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/maori-seats/survey_tools/feedback-form</a></p>

<p>Reminders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay Equity. The TEU pay equity claim for administrative and library staff is active. This claim has the potential to affect as many as 900 UoA staff members. We are now moving into a new phase of the claim, where member involvement is very important. If you’ve received an email from TEU administrator Lucy Fowler about your role, make sure you’ve replied! If you are interested in more information, email Nicole or Lucy:  <a href="mailto:nicole.wallace@teu.ac.nz">nicole.wallace@teu.ac.nz</a> or <a href="mailto:lucy.fowler@teu.ac.nz">lucy.fowler@teu.ac.nz</a>.</li>
<li>TEU office hours.  Our organisers, Nicole and Andy, will be running open office hours on the City Campus every Friday from 10am till 2pm, in the TEU Office, Room 417, Level 4 of the Fisher Building (Building 804, 18 Waterloo Quadrant). Drop in for advice or to catch up on TEU activities.</li>
