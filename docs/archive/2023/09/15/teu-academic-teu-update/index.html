Day of Action: Kāpuia kia tapatahi | Strong education and training together. We thank members who turned out for our stop-work meeting. We thank our colleagues from AUT, Unitec, and Massey U (Albany) who travelled to be in solidarity. We note that ours was one of many events, at the same time across the country. All the other events were highly successful, according to reports received from branch leadership in other workplaces. Unfortunately coinciding with a more official but less well attended meeting (on the election, science and innovation), our meeting drew a crowd that filled most of the large theatre. We began with our TEU karakia but immediately picked up the live stream from VUW, at which National President Julie Douglas, National Secretary, Sandra Grey, and Jan Tinetti (Minister of Education) all spoke of the parlous situation confronting universities, their staff and their students. Switching to local, in-person discussion, candidates Camilla Belich from Labour, Chloe Swarbrick from Greens attended, spoke to their party positions and answered questions. A surprise arrival was Oscar Sims, Labour candidate for Auckland Central who we also gave the floor to speak. Takutai Tash Kemp from Te Pāti Māori confirmed but then was a late withdrawal. Right-of-centre parties were invited but could not be bothered with us, apparently.  We placed empty seats, symbolic of their absence. We then had a 30+ min Q&amp;A with members. Members spoke to the politicians with courtesy but also with deep anguish. The angst in the sector is real and it is deep.   We will have to continue to fight to get our message across. It is a legal requirement that we now note: Authorised by Sandra Grey, 204 Willis Street, Wellington.</p>

<p>After the stop-work meeting, Branch committee member Tamsin Kingston wrote: “Yesterday evening I went to a local business association &#39;Meet the Candidates&#39; meeting in Onehunga. Inspired by the passion I heard at our paid union meeting yesterday, I asked a question regarding how their parties were going to address the tertiary sector funding crisis.  Their answers were pretty bland (they only had 1 minute to answer) but interesting just the same.  Some were clearly better informed than others.  At the networking afterwards I was able to speak to the Green Party and ACT Party candidates and a Labour minister.  It was great to be able to directly address something that the ACT candidate had stated as a problem with tertiary education (she said that they would reduce the numbers of non-teaching staff) - she now understands what non-teaching staff do!  It was also good to get a chance to speak about the crisis of funding that is facing the tertiary sector directly with people who may have a significant influence on our futures.  I strongly encourage members to take up opportunities like this to interact with politicians and convey the importance of funding tertiary education appropriately.” That is great advice from Tamsin: Please find and attend local meet-the-candidates meetings in your electorate. Ask questions. Interrogate the candidates. Lay down the wero.</p>
<p>As an aside, in pre-meeting conversation, I asked our MP guests to estimate what proportion of current MPs have a tertiary degree. They thought that almost all do. So then I asked: so why do they not see the importance of tertiary education such that it is on the agenda during the campaign? Guess how they responded?  Answer below*.</p>
<p>New Zealand funds public education at a rate 25% lower than OECD average - A new report<a href="https://teu.ac.nz/news/aotearoa-education-spending-out-of-step/">https://teu.ac.nz/news/aotearoa-education-spending-out-of-step/</a> jointly commissioned by TEU, NZEI and PPTA shows tertiary education funding has not kept up with other public expenditure, with countries like Canada and the UK, or even with the OECD average. This shows a long-term failure to value education. Julie Douglas, TEU National President, says, “While we would have liked the current government to do more, the right’s track record is worse and, if elected, National’s tax plan will result in even less money for education. If voters want a world-class education system, we must demand better from all the political parties.” Authorised by Sandra Grey, 204 Willis Street, Wellington.</p>
<p>Medical Academics.  You should now have received an update on the situation with your remuneration from Nicole. There will be more updates on this next week.</p>
<p>Annual General Meeting. We have set our AGM for 1pm, 26 September in the Law School (801.204).  Members should have received an invitation from Lucy Fowler today. Confirmation details will follow, and Lucy Fowler will send a calendar invite soon with nomination forms.  Please consider standing for the Branch Committee.  See previous weeks&#39; Updates for details of the various roles and branch structure. Members can stand for any role for which they feel suited and to which they can apply their energies.  Every branch role is up for re-election every year. It is a one-year commitment. The branch committee meets monthly.  If you are interested in being involved with the work of the Branch Committee but not yet confident enough to pursue a named role, consider standing as a member at large. These members join the Branch Committee without a specific portfolio of work. It can be a useful way to learn how the branch operates.</p>
<p>Suffrage Day. The TEU will also be holding a special pay equity event on Suffrage Day, 19 September, from 12.30 – 1.30pm in the Federation Room of OGH. Women have had the vote in NZ for 130 years; now it’s time to stand for fair pay! The TEU will be launching our Pay Equity member videos. Come and hear colleagues from across the country speak to their experiences and chat about the claim, all over some food. All staff under the pay equity claim are invited, including non-members. All other members welcome, especially if you work closely with those staff who are under the claim.</p>
<p>Congratulations.  Heartfelt congratulations to local TEU members who have been awarded recognition for their sustained, high-quality scholarship.</p>

<p>Reminders:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pay Equity. The TEU pay equity claim for administrative and library staff is active. This claim has the potential to affect as many as 900 UoA staff members. We are now moving into a new phase of the claim, where member involvement is very important. If you’ve received an email from TEU administrator Lucy Fowler about your role, make sure you’ve replied! If you are interested in more information, email Nicole or Lucy:  <a href="mailto:nicole.wallace@teu.ac.nz">nicole.wallace@teu.ac.nz</a> or <a href="mailto:lucy.fowler@teu.ac.nz">lucy.fowler@teu.ac.nz</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>University committee elections. Members will have received email from our Whip, Jennifer Frost. We encourage members to run for committees and roles as they see fit. Our endorsement of a candidate has proved to be highly beneficial to candidates.  And candidates’ endorsement implies a familiarity with TEU policies as they might relate and bringing a union ethos to the role.  If you need more time to submit materials to Jennifer, please notify her of your intent today and get materials through over the weekend or early next week.</p>
</li>
<li><p>TEU office hours.  Our organisers, Nicole and Andy, will be running open office hours on the City Campus every Friday from 10am till 2pm, in the TEU Office, Room 417, Level 4 of the Fisher Building (Building 804, 18 Waterloo Quadrant). Drop in for advice or to catch up on TEU activities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I thought they would say: because it is not a vote-getter like lower taxes, cutting fat, or some other talking point. But the response was: because once graduated and gainfully employed, most tend to think of themselves as “self-made”, not taught.</p>
