<p>E ngā mana, e ngā reo, e ngā mātāwaka. Tēnā koutou katoa i runga i te kaupapa whakahirahira o Te Wiki o te reo Māori. Welcome to Māori Language Week 2023.</p>
<p>We are celebrating this year’s theme, Kia Kaha Te Reo Māori: Making the Language Stronger, with a series of events and activities across the University<a href="https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/news-events-and-notices/news/news-2023/09/te-wiki-o-te-reo-maori-2023.html">https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/news-events-and-notices/news/news-2023/09/te-wiki-o-te-reo-maori-2023.html</a>.

<p>New role for Professor Pene Mathew</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce that Professor Pene Mathew, Dean of Law, has been appointed as Human Rights Commissioner and President of the ACT Human Rights Commission in the Australian Capital Territory. In this important and exciting role, Pene will be working with human rights in a practical, impactful way for the benefit of residents of the Territory, the first Australian jurisdiction to adopt a Human Rights Act.</p>
<p>Pene will start in her new position in late October 2023, at which time Professor Warren Swain will take on the role of Acting Dean of Law. I would like to acknowledge and thank Pene for her outstanding leadership of the Law Faculty over her tenure.</p>
