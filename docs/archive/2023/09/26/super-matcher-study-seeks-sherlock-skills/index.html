<p>Do you have Sherlock Holmes-style powers of observation and razor-sharp attention to detail?</p>
<p>You could be a ‘super-matcher’; a phenomenon being studied by Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury Psychology Lecturer Dr Bethany Growns.</p>
<p>Super-matchers are a very small percentage of the population who are innately gifted at comparing or matching complex visual patterns; something that forensic scientists train for many years to do.</p>
<p>“We have found that there are rare individuals in the general population who are extremely accurate in pattern-matching – also known as visual comparison,” Dr Growns says. “One example is fingerprint-matching where people are asked to decide if two fingerprints are from the same person or different people.</p>

<p>“Our research has shown that some people are highly accurate in this task across a range of different complex visual patterns. We think only about 2 to 3 per cent of the population have this type of innate skill.”</p>
<p>Dr Growns has created a quick online test to identify super-matchers and she is keen for as many people as possible to take the test and find out if they have super skills.</p>
<p>Dr Growns says little is currently known about what makes super-matchers so skilled at pattern-matching and more research is essential to help find out what makes them so unique.</p>
<p>“We think there are people out there that are naturally gifted with this psychological ability. We don’t really understand why yet, but it might have a specific genetic or neurological component.”</p>
<p>She says people vary widely in their visual comparison skill – the ability to compare or ‘match’ stimuli side-by-side – particularly forensic evidence like fingerprints, toolmarks or shoeprints. Forensic evidence can play a very influential role in court, but it has also resulted in wrongful convictions around the world where innocent people have been convicted of crimes they didn’t commit.</p>
<p>Dr Growns says the results of her recent studies challenge the long-held belief that forensic scientists’ abilities are solely the result of years of experience and training. She believes it could be possible for super-matchers to work within the criminal justice system in the future to reduce some of the errors that might result in wrongful convictions.</p>
<p>Dr Growns is the lead author of a recent <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology</em> journal article describing the results of two studies where 124 participants were tested on their matching ability of fingerprints, firearms, faces, toolmarks, shoeprints and artificially generated patterns.</p>
<p>The results show that pattern-matching ability is a “generalisable, reliable, and stable cognitive skill”. Some people outperformed others in pattern-matching tasks regardless of experience, training or practice.</p>
<p>Dr Growns says research investigating individual differences in pattern-matching is only just beginning to emerge.</p>
<p>“We believe there are important factors to investigate in developing a more comprehensive understanding of pattern-matching as a cognitive ability.</p>
<p>“The results will have important implications for forensic science – particularly the importance of developing standardised tests that could be used to recruit new high-performing forensic trainees.”</p>
