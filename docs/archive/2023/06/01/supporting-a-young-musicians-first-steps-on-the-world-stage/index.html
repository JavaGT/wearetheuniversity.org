<p><strong>Larissa Kent</strong>, aged 25, from Havelock North is thrilled to have been awarded a Kia Ora Foundation Patricia Pratt Scholarship to attend one of the most prestigious music academies in the world.</p>
<p>“I’m so excited to be studying at SFCM, and incredibly grateful for receiving this scholarship to help me get there. Attending SFCM will provide incredible learning opportunities and I am honoured to be accepted into César Ulloa’s studio, one of the world’s finest voice teachers. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity made possible by receiving the Kia Ora Foundation Patricia Pratt Scholarship and I cannot wait to embark on this adventure and to continue sharing my passion for this magnificent art form!”</p>
<p>Larissa graduated in 2022 with a Bachelor of Music with First-Class Honours in Classical Voice Performance from the University of Auckland where she learnt from Swedish mezzo-soprano Catrin Johnsson. For her master’s degree she will participate in a two-year intensive programme consisting of voice lessons, vocal coachings, opera scenes productions, stagecraft, and other collaborative work, as well as many performance opportunities.</p>

<p>Larissa’s vocal coach Rachel Fuller says, “Her high level of musicianship is apparent in her singing with a wonderful sense of legato, attention to details and style, refined ensemble skills and a great desire to find expressive colours in her sound. Larissa is an exceptional talent, with a glorious young voice of enormous potential – and a determination to match.”</p>
<p>Two further scholarships have been awarded to the 2022 Kia Ora Foundation Patricia Pratt Scholarship recipients, <strong>Bethany Angus</strong> and <strong>Felicity Tomkins</strong>, to enable a second year of study.</p>

<p>Bethany Angus is studying towards a master’s degree in cello performance at the Royal Conservatoire The Hague in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The Royal Conservatoire is one of the top institutions in the world for early music, a particular passion for Bethany, who as well as being a cellist, is an accomplished keyboardist and plays as a casual harpsichordist with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.</p>
<p>For her master’s project, Bethany is writing a guide to baroque cello playing aimed at classical players who would like to explore the baroque style in more depth but may not have access to a baroque cello or high-level teaching.</p>
<p>Having enrolled in the summer semester, Felicity Tomkins’ second-year scholarship will enable her to complete the Artist Diploma in Opera Vocal Performance at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music (CCM) in August this year.</p>
<p>Highlights of Felicity’s first year at CCM included being the soprano soloist in Mahler’s 4 Symphony with the CCM Chamber Orchestra and an immersion course in Germany for six to eight weeks as part of a new initiative for Artist Diploma students. After she completes her studies, Felicity will debut with the Cincinnati Opera company.</p>
<p>The Kia Ora Foundation Patricia Pratt Scholarship is funded by the Kia Ora Foundation, established in 1997 by Aotearoa New Zealand-born philanthropist Annette Campbell-White in memory of her mother, Patricia Pratt, to help outstanding young New Zealand musicians continue their musical development at a renowned international music school or conservatorium for up to two years. The scholarships are awarded for classical music performance, including vocal or instrumental performance or conducting.</p>
<p>Applications for the 2024 Kia Ora Foundation Patricia Pratt Scholarship open on 1 November and close on 1 March. Further details are on the scholarship’s page on the Universities New Zealand – Te Pokai Tara website.</p>
<p>The scholarship is administered by Universities New Zealand along with around 40 others worth more than $2 million.</p>
