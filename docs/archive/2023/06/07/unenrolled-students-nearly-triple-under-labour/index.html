<p><strong>Wednesday, 7 June 2023, 9:44 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The number of students unenrolled from school has nearly tripled under Labour, National’s Education spokesperson Erica Stanford says.</p>
<p>“When Labour took office in October 2017, the number of students on the non-enrolled list was 3,274. By the end of March 2023, the number had jumped to 9,205.</p>
<p>“These are students that have completely disengaged from school, with most not attending for more than 20 school days.</p>
<p>“Data provided to National also shows a dramatic increase in the time it takes to re-engage these students.</p>
<p>“In March 2017, the average number of days to re-engage a student in Auckland was 84. In March 2023, it was 183 days.</p>
<p>“This is devastating. Not only are half of students not attending school regularly, but this Government is demonstrably failing New Zealand’s most-vulnerable students who depend on a great education and the opportunities it will afford them.</p>
<p>“While tomorrow the Education Minister will be defending her own actions at Parliament’s Privileges Committee, it must not be forgotten that Labour is failing to deliver in education.</p>
<p>“Right now, our kids are not going to school, achievement levels are plummeting, and more and more schools are choosing to ditch NCEA Level 1 altogether because they have no confidence in the Government’s NCEA change package.</p>
<p>“Labour has no plan for the future and is robbing hundreds of thousands of Kiwi kids of the world-class education they deserve.</p>
<p>“Rather than excuses and empty classrooms, a National government would restore excellence to the heart of the education system by teaching the basics brilliantly so every student has the same opportunity to live the life they want.”</p>
