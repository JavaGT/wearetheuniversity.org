<p><strong>Friday, 30 June 2023, 10:29 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour’s price hike at the fuel pumps this weekend will cause problems beyond the 29-cent spike, National’s Finance spokesperson Nicola Willis says.</p>
<p>“Not only will Kiwis be hit by the $15 extra to fill up the tank of an average car, the price hikes will likely hit sausage rolls, bread, butter - and other basic food items that Kiwi families are already struggling to pay.</p>
<p>“Labour is ripping off this band-aid policy in one painful swoop. The Government has had months to unwind their knee-jerk policy solution, but it all comes crashing down tomorrow.</p>
<p>“The damaging follow-on effects of the price hike will likely be felt across the wider economy and hit household budgets hard.</p>
<p>“Worse, the inflationary impact will come at time when the recession is hitting home. We can expect this pain at the pump to damage inflationary expectations and keep interest rates high.</p>
<p>“There will be a slump from the pump and New Zealanders can look forward to a Black Saturday thanks to Labour’s inept economic management.</p>
<p>“National would address the underlying drivers of inflation by restoring discipline to Government spending; helping Kiwis cope with living costs by delivering income tax reductions of at least $960 per year for an average income earner.</p>
<p>“National will help drive New Zealand out of recession by backing businesses to grow.”</p>
