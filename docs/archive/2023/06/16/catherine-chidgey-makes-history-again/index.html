<p><strong>Friday, 16 June 2023, 5:05 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Multi-award-winning writer Catherine Chidgey’s new novel, <em>Pet</em>, has shot to number one on the New Zealand bestseller list after only two days on sale.</p>
<p>The chilling psychological novel, set in a Catholic primary school in the 1980s, is followed on the bestseller list by another Chidgey page-turner, <em>The Axeman’s Carnival</em>, making her the first ever New Zealand writer to simultaneously take the number one and two positions.</p>
<p><em>The Axeman’s Carnival</em> has been continuously in the top 10 since publication in October 2022 and won the $64,000 Jann Medlicott Acorn Prize for Fiction at the Ockham New Zealand Book awards. Chidgey won the same prize in 2017 for <em>The Wish Child</em>, the first time a writer has won the prize twice.</p>
<p>Newsroom’s Steve Braunias revealed that the last time an author came close to Chidgey’s double-bestseller pole position was in 2013 when Eleanor Catton’s <em>The Luminaries</em> was number one, and her previous novel <em>The Rehearsal</em> at number three.</p>
<p>Catherine Chidgey and Eleanor Catton are both published by Te Herenga Waka University Press.</p>
<p>The Press’s publisher Fergus Barrowman says he is thrilled to see Catherine’s spectacular success continue 25 years after the publication of her first book.</p>
<p>“Catherine has been a major literary talent right from her 1998 debut novel <em>In A Fishbone Church</em> which won Best First Book at the New Zealand Book Awards.</p>
<p>“It’s an honour to publish both Eleanor and Catherine, and to see such gifted writers taking the top three bestseller positions.</p>

<p>“This is testimony to the value of Te Herenga Waka–Victoria University’s long-term support for New Zealand writing and publishing. “</p>
<p>Chidgey’s <em>Pet</em> will be published internationally next month and is receiving early praise, with the US Crimereads.com calling it: ‘the most anticipated crime fiction of summer 2023’. Booklist US critic Merle Jacob stated: ‘lovers of Donna Tartt’s <em>The Secret History</em> will want to read this compelling novel by an award-winning New Zealand author.’ In the UK, <em>Pet</em> was selected as July’s Book of the Month in <em>The Bookseller Preview</em>.</p>
<p>Chidgey’s previous titles also received international accolades_. In a Fishbone Church_ won the Commonwealth Writers’ Prize (South East Asia and South Pacific), the UK Betty Trask Award and was longlisted for the Orange Prize; her second novel <em>Golden Deeds</em> was a Notable Book of the Year in the <em>New York Times Book Review</em> and a Best Book in the <em>LA Times;</em> her 2020 novel, <em>Remote Sympathy</em>, was shortlisted for the DUBLIN Literary Award and the Jann Medlicott Acorn Prize for Fiction, and was longlisted for the Women’s Prize for Fiction.</p>
<p>Catherine Chidgey is currently writing <em>The Book of Guilt</em> - her ninth novel.</p>
