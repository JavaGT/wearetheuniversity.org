<p><strong>Friday, 16 June 2023, 11:27 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Education Minister must delay changes to NCEA Level 1 that are due to be implemented next year, National’s Education spokesperson Erica Stanford says.</p>
<p>“Students have become the collateral damage in Labour’s changes to NCEA, which have been an utter shambles from the get-go.</p>
<p>“The Labour Government’s decision to push ahead with Level 1, but delay Levels 2 and 3 was politically driven by an under-fire Education Minister trying to save face as schools across New Zealand reject the changes.</p>
<p>“This staggered introduction means Kiwi students will have to sit both new and old standards, creating a misalignment that will negatively impact their learning.</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s largest high school, Rangitoto College, has already said it will do away with Level 1 altogether and introduce its own diploma to ensure a logical and coherent learning programme for students.</p>
<p>“Despite high-profile schools pulling out of the refreshed NCEA, Education Minister Jan Tinetti revealed this week that she hasn’t even bothered to ask for advice on delaying the changes.</p>
<p>“The sector is sending a resounding message to the Government that they have no confidence in these changes that will only make things worse.</p>
<p>“This is embarrassing for Labour, and it couldn’t be clearer that the only option is to pause the shambolic roll-out of the NCEA Change Programme and listen to schools and principals.</p>
<p>“Unlike Labour, National is aspirational for children. National won’t force schools into a change programme they are unprepared for, which could jeopardize learning.</p>
<p>“New Zealand students deserve a world-class education that sets them up for success, and parents have a clear choice this election. A Labour Government that has spent $5 billion more on education while children are going backwards, or a National government that will ensure every child has the skills they need in reading, writing and maths through our Teaching the Basics Brilliantly policy.”</p>
