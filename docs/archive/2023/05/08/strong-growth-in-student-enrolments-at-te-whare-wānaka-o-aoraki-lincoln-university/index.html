<p><strong>Monday, 8 May 2023, 10:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>The number of students choosing to study at Te Whare Wānaka o Aoraki Lincoln University has increased again in 2023, continuing the University’s strong growth trajectory since the pre-COVID era (2019).</p>
<p>As of 1 May, 3,288 students were enrolled at Lincoln, up 16% from 2,843 at the same time last year. The University expects its total 2023 enrolments to approach 4,000 students by the end of the year.</p>
<p>While international student numbers have returned to 62% of pre-COVID levels, the University has experienced strong domestic growth since 2019. The number of domestic students currently enrolled, at 2,534, is 57% higher than the 2019 number of 1,613.</p>
<p>The Lincoln University halls of residence are filled to capacity in 2023, including 64 newly refurbished self-catered units brought on-stream for the 2023 cohort.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Grant Edwards said the strong growth signals Lincoln University’s increasing influence in shaping the future of the land-based sector in Aotearoa and globally.</p>
<p>“Our world-class education programmes position our students to contribute directly and consequentially to industry when they enter employment, and our graduate employment rate of 85% is consistently the highest of all the New Zealand universities.</p>
<p>“Increasingly the research we undertake at Lincoln is leading positive and impactful change in the land-based industries in an era where all sectors of society are demanding the application of more efficient and sustainable production practices that safeguard the environment and intergenerational wellbeing.</p>

<p>“And underpinning everything we do at Lincoln University is our outstanding student experience, where our students begin their journey to lifelong success within a thriving and inclusive student community and a vibrant, diverse and enriching campus environment.”</p>
<p>Also contributing to the strong popularity of Lincoln University’s education programmes is the University’s fees waiver scheme.</p>
<p>First introduced in 2020 amid pandemic-related restrictions, the scheme has been extended to cover postgraduate study options until the end of 2024.</p>
<p>The fee waivers aim to help meet a growing demand for experts in the food, fibre, and environment management sectors, with the fees-free options including postgraduate certificates and diplomas, as well as taught master’s degrees and the taught component of research master’s programmes.</p>
<p>The most popular programmes for students attending Lincoln University in 2023 are the Bachelor of Land and Property Management and Bachelor of Commerce (Agriculture).</p>
<p>Programme Director for the Bachelor of Land and Property Management, Professor Graham Squires, said the popularity of the programme reflects New Zealanders’ high interest in property matters, in both a personal and professional capacity.</p>
<p>“The reputation of our Bachelor of Land and Property Management is underpinned by the quality of the programme and our high-profile and highly regarded teaching staff, as well as our strong industry connections. The programme is accredited for five main industry bodies, which is a drawcard for those in the industry or anyone seeking employment in the sector.</p>
<p>“Our close engagement with the property sector enables us to provide valuable practical experience, and the employment rate from the programme is extremely high, at pretty much 100%.”</p>
<p>Professor Squires expects the growth in domestic student numbers will soon be matched by the emerging international market for real estate/property studies.</p>
<p>“Skilled practitioners in the land and property management sectors will continue to be highly sought-after and well-rewarded going into the future, both nationally and internationally.”</p>
