<p>Labour’s Budget spends an eye-watering amount, yet achieves nothing for most New Zealanders, National’s Finance spokesperson Nicola Willis says.</p>
<p>“In Budget 2023, Grant Robertson has taken his spending up to $137 billion – $61 billion more since Labour came to office, and equivalent to $28,000 more in spending every year for every Kiwi family.</p>
<p>“But New Zealanders will rightfully be asking themselves: have we got $28,000 worth of value from this spending? The answer is clearly no.</p>
<p>“The cost-of-living crisis continues to rage on, interest rates are through the roof, hospital waiting lists are longer, and educational achievement is going backwards.</p>
<p>“According to Treasury, Labour’s addiction to spending will cause interest rates to remain higher for longer. Grant Robertson’s economic mismanagement means Kiwis are on the hook for thousands of dollars a year in higher mortgage payments for years to come.</p>
<p>“The Budget should have delivered meaningful tax relief for New Zealanders – but it didn’t.</p>
<p>“Labour are spending on poorly thought-out economic Band Aids - but still haven’t done anything to address the drivers of skyrocketing mortgage costs and inflation. In fact, this Budget just added to them.</p>
<p>“National will fix the economy by stopping wasteful spending and providing tax relief. A strong economy and disciplined government spending will lift incomes, deal with the cost-of-living crisis, and allow us to afford the public services Kiwis deserve.”</p>
