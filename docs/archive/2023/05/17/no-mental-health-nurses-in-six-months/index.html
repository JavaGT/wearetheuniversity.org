<p><strong>Wednesday, 17 May 2023, 12:00 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>No mental health nurses have arrived in New Zealand in the last six months, National’s Mental Health and Suicide Prevention spokesperson Matt Doocey says.</p>
<p>“For more than a year, Labour ignored the pleas from National and the health sector to urgently add nurses to the straight the residency pathway.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is short at least 4,000 nurses across the health sector, including at least 400 mental health nurses.</p>
<p>“Despite other countries like Australia and Canada offering these essential workers more attractive immigration pathways, Labour dragged its feet and as a result no mental health nurses have arrived in the country this year.</p>
<p>“The lack of mental health nurses is a critical issue, causing burnout for our current frontline staff and longer wait times for New Zealanders in need.</p>
<p>“It beggars belief why Labour refused to act on the nurses shortage and now vulnerable New Zealanders are paying the price.</p>
<p>“Just last month, a mental health patient was forced to wait 94 hours in the emergency department for an inpatient bed to become available, with staffing shortages being cited as a key reason.</p>
<p>“While Labour fail to act, a National government will deliver more nurses. We will provide an incentive for up to 1,000 overseas nurses to relocate to New Zealand by paying them up to $10,000 to help with their move. National will also retain more of our homegrown nurses by offering to pay student loan repayments in return for a five year bonding agreement.</p>
<p>“Our health sector needs more nurses to urgently arrive on our shores. Labour has failed, but National will deliver.”</p>
