<p><strong>Thursday, 9 March 2023, 3:09 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The next National Government will unlock investment in purpose built ‘Build-to-Rent’ rental housing in New Zealand, National’s Housing spokesperson Chris Bishop says.</p>
<p>Build-to-Rent developments typically consist of multi-unit residential developments within walking distance of key transport links. The developments are professionally managed, with great amenities and offer residents a variety of lifestyle options as well as unique security of tenure to tenants.</p>
<p>“Build-to-Rent developments are an important part of housing markets in countries we like to compare ourselves to, but remain rare in New Zealand,” says Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>“If National is elected to govern this year, we will move quickly to make two legislative changes to help make Build-to-Rent developments get off the ground in this country.</p>
<p>“We will do this by amending the Overseas Investment Act to give greater certainty for institutional investors to invest in New Zealand’s Build-to-Rent market. We need both domestic and international capital to help us house Kiwis.</p>
<p>“It is nuts that retirement homes, rest homes and student accommodation have an easier ride through the Overseas Investment Act than Build-to-Rent developments. We will make sure they are treated the same.</p>
<p>“National will also change the Income Tax Act to ensure that Build-to-Rent developments are eligible for depreciation deductions like other commercial buildings.</p>
<p>“Labour has talked a big game on Build-to-Rent for years but has failed to take the necessary action to get the sector going. Labour’s humiliating U-turn last year reintroducing interest deductibility for new Build-to-Rent developments was a good step forward, but further changes are required and the next National Government will get them done.”</p>
