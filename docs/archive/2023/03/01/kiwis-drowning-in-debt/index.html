<p><strong>Wednesday, 1 March 2023, 12:47 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour’s mismanagement of the economy is leaving more Kiwis drowning in debt, National’s Finance spokesperson Nicola Willis says.</p>
<p>“Today’s debt arrears data from Centrix confirms that thousands more New Zealanders are falling into debt trouble, crushed by the cost-of-living crisis, high inflation, and higher interest rates.</p>
<p>“Approximately 430,000 Kiwis are now behind on debt repayments, including mortgages, credit cards and Buy Now Pay Later accounts.</p>
<p>“Nearly 1 in 10 Kiwis with a personal loan are now in arrears – the highest level since the data started in 2017.</p>
<p>“This data is an indictment on a Government that has stoked inflation by pumping up spending, choking off immigration and adding costs in every direction.</p>
<p>“Even while Kiwis drown in debt the Government has refused to reduce taxes by bringing discipline to its own spending, instead forging ahead with pet political projects like the $30 billion Auckland Light Rail Project and record spending on consultants and policy advisors.</p>
<p>“It’s incredibly concerning that – with a recession forecast for later this year – hundreds of thousands of Kiwis are already in financial trouble.</p>
<p>“National once again urges the Government to reduce the growing tax burden on hard working Kiwis and let them keep more of what they earn.</p>
<p>“National would adjust tax brackets for inflation; bring discipline to Government spending; stop adding new costs; fix worker shortages and focus the Reserve Bank on meeting a low inflation mandate.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile Labour offers the same old play book: spend, spend, spend, and tax, tax, tax with hard working New Zealanders paying the ever-higher price.”</p>
