<p><strong>Wednesday, 22 March 2023, 6:05 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>A National Government will rewrite the New Zealand Curriculum to ensure every child has the basic skills they need in reading, writing, maths and science to set them up for further education and for life, National Leader Christopher Luxon says.</p>
<p>Mr Luxon will announce <em>Teaching the Basics Brilliantly,</em> the first part of National’s education policy in the Hutt Valley on Thursday.</p>
<p>“Education is critical for unlocking a better future for all New Zealanders and equipping the next generation with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed,” Mr Luxon says.</p>
<p>“A world-class education system is essential for driving social mobility, helping break cycles of poverty, and giving every child the chance to live the life they want.</p>
<p>“We cannot have world-class incomes and living standards without a world-class education system.</p>
<p>“But the current state of education in New Zealand is alarming. Achievement has been in decline for the last 30 years and a recent NCEA pilot exposed just how far achievement has fallen, with a staggering two-thirds of students unable to meet the minimum standard in reading, writing and maths.</p>
<p>“National will not allow this to continue. National will make sure every child leaving primary and intermediate school can master the basics so they can succeed at high school and lead fulfilling lives.</p>
<p>“Today I am announcing National will rewrite the New Zealand Curriculum to detail the non-negotiable knowledge and skills that primary and intermediate schools must cover each year in reading, writing, maths, and science.</p>

<p>“At the moment, one curriculum level can span several school years which makes it difficult to identify and help children who are falling behind.</p>
<p>“Evidence shows children’s abilities are often underestimated and therefore the looseness in the New Zealand Curriculum means some Kiwi kids are learning the building blocks of reading, writing and maths later than they should.</p>
<p>“The curriculum also adds a significant workload for teachers who are constantly having to work out what to teach and when.</p>
<p>“We need a lot more than Labour’s curriculum refresh. We must be more ambitious for our children.</p>
<p>“If New Zealand wants to turn around declining achievement and ensure every child makes consistent progress, we need a curriculum that provides clear and detailed guidance to teachers and parents on what students should be learning each school year.</p>
<p>“National will deliver that and give every child the opportunity to succeed.”</p>
