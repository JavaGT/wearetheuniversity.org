<p><strong>Thursday, 16 March 2023, 4:33 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Education Minister Jan Tinetti has conceded that after five years of a Labour Government there has been no improvement in the achievement levels of primary school students, National’s Education spokesperson Erica Stanford says.</p>
<p>“Today in Parliament, the Minister was forced to admit – after more than five years of Labour – achievement levels of Year 8 students have not improved at all.</p>
<p>“This a shocking statement from a Minister whose Government is spending an extra $5 billion on education every year but has failed to deliver any improvement in education outcomes.</p>
<p>“The Minister’s main job is to ensure that kids leave school with the skills they need to succeed.</p>
<p>“Instead, the only thing that Labour can point to after five years in government is a waffling strategy document that fails to explain what concrete steps they will take to turn around our falling standards, and hasn’t even been implemented yet.</p>
<p>“Data from the National Monitoring Study of Student Achievement (NMSSA) shows that just 45 per cent of Year 8 students were meeting curriculum expectations in maths, 35 per cent for writing and 20 per cent for science.</p>
<p>“This is simply not good enough.</p>
<p>“Our children deserve better than a Government that is considering making tests easier to avoid a bad headline.</p>
<p>&quot;We need a serious plan to deliver kids an education with the basics they need to succeed, not more excuses. National will be laser-focused on lifting student performance and making sure that resources are making it out of Wellington offices and making it into classrooms.”</p>
