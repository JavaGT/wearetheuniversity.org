<p><strong>Tuesday, 12 December 2023, 10:52 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Peace_Action_Wellington">Peace Action Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>“The Minister of Foreign Affairs’ speech outlining a new approach for<br>New Zealand should be ringing alarm bells for anyone concerned about<br>preventing a war in our region,” said Peace Action Wellington member<br>Valerie Morse.</p>
<p>“Winston Peters claims to be interested in multilateralism, but what he<br>advocates for is closer relationships to the US empire and its<br>aggressive posturing in the South Pacific. He intends ‘reinvigorating<br>defence engagement’ with the United States and other Five Eyes partners<br>which translates to signing up to AUKUS, the multibillion dollar weapons<br>deal between the US, Australia and the UK with disastrous results for<br>peace in our region.”</p>
<p>“New Zealand troops already participate in two enormous war planning<br>exercises led by the US: RIMPAC (‘the Rim of the Pacific’) naval<br>training held in Hawai’i with 25,000 troops, and Talisman Sabre,<br>land-based combat training held in Australia involving 30,000 troops.<br>The NZDF is already highly integrated with US forces.”</p>
<p>“There are the existing Washington and Wellington Declarations, defence<br>cooperation agreements between the US and New Zealand. There is the Five<br>Eyes partnership that includes technical and staff sharing between<br>intelligence agencies.”</p>
<p>“It is also extraordinary that Peters’ claims to be interested in<br>multilateralism while he engages in obstructing international<br>institutions like the World Health Organisation. This is straight out of<br>the US far right playbook. He is interested in tearing down genuine<br>multilateralism in favour of the US-led order.”</p>

<p>“His speech makes oblique references to ‘illegal invasions’ while he<br>refuses to call for an immediate ceasefire in the mass atrocity that is<br>Israel’s war on Gaza, and the decades-long illegal occupation of<br>Palestinian lands. Instead he makes milquetoast statements calling for<br>‘measures’ towards a ceasefire while thousands more people are murdered<br>by a relentless bombing campaign.”</p>
<p>“The United States is the greatest threat to global peace and security<br>bar none. Its sole interest is in maintaining US economic domination. It<br>is not interested in democracy or peace when those conflict with its own<br>economic interests.”</p>
<p>“The US engagement in the Pacific is driven by its fear of China. It is<br>fueling an arms race in the South Pacific, and billions of dollars are<br>spent buying weapons that should be used to address real problems<br>including climate change and healthcare.”</p>
<p>“Closer alignment to the US will see billions funneled to US weapons<br>dealers and a more dangerous region. New Zealand should instead be a<br>regional leader for a South Pacific weapons-free zone with an aggressive<br>disarmament strategy to rid the entire area of the seeds of conflict.”</p>
