<p><strong>Wednesday, 27 December 2023, 7:01 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“ACT finished 2023 delivering good news for small businesses. That’s just the beginning of a new business-friendly environment ACT will create,” says ACT’s Small Business spokesperson Laura Trask.</p>
<p>“ACT Deputy Leader Brooke van Velden, in her capacity as Workplace Relations Minister, has already widened the availability of 90-day trials to all businesses and repealed ‘Fair Pay’ Agreements. That’s real change in only her first few weeks as a Minister. ACT’s coalition agreement also commits to reforming health and safety law and regulations.</p>
<p>“As a small business owner myself, I know the death by a thousand cuts that occurs when a Government piles on regulation after regulation – each one costing more productivity and money.</p>
<p>“Reinstating 90-day trials gives employers certainty and employees opportunities. Young or low-skilled workers, or people who have been out of work have the most to gain from being employed on a trial basis.</p>
<p>“Since Labour has been in Government it has become tougher to hire employees, more expensive to keep them, and materials have exploded in price.</p>
<p>“Small businesses are the backbone of New Zealand’s economy. If New Zealand is to have a thriving and productive economy, we need to make it a better place for small business to operate in. ACT is committed to doing that.”</p>
