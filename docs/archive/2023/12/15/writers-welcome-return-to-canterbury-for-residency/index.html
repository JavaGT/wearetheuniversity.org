<p><strong>Friday, 15 December 2023, 10:04 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>Acclaimed author Nic Low (Ngāi Tahu) returns to the University of Canterbury to take up one of two Ursula Bethell Writers in Residence placements.</p>
<p>The 2024 residency will be a step back into familiar territory for Low, who was an undergraduate in the English Department at Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury (UC) 20 years ago.</p>
<p>He says it will be a privilege to return to the department early next year and start writing his fourth book. “I took some good steps towards becoming a writer when I was at UC. I learned to love the craft of words, and while studying post-colonial writing I started to understand how the exercise of power is tied up with the stories we tell.</p>
<p>“I&#39;ll be working on a novel about a group of Māori soldiers who, heading home through London after World War 1, decide to rob the British Museum. The idea is to write a literary heist novel that explores how we think about taonga as living ancestors, and the legacy of colonial museums. I guess I’m interested in who gets to keep what they stole, and why,” Low says.</p>
<p>Ōtautahi’s reputation for live comedy and theatre was a key attraction for award-winning author Pip Adam, who will take up the Ursula Bethell residency in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Christchurch, Adam now lives in Wellington but is excited to be returning to Christchurch for her tenure.</p>
<p>“I have loved coming to the Word Christchurch Festival the last few years and getting a glimpse of the thriving writing and arts communities there. I&#39;ve been looking a lot at humour and theatre recently, so one thing that particularly attracted me to Ōtautahi was the live comedy and theatre happening in the city, which looks amazing,” she says.</p>

<p>“I think being a bit &#39;lost&#39; in a new city and having to relearn things that I take for granted is always good for my writing. It makes my brain work in different ways which helps me think differently about my work.”</p>
<p>During her residency, Adam will work on a new novel that explores the ways humour is weaponised.</p>
<p>“It&#39;s kind of fuelled by all the times I&#39;ve been told I need to &#39;lighten up&#39; or that it&#39;s &#39;just a joke&#39;. I have written a bit toward the novel but I&#39;m really looking forward to challenging what I&#39;ve written and being open to the possibility of starting over.”</p>
