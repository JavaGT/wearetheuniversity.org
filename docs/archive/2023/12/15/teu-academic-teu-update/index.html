<p>Tēnā koutou katoa</p>
<p>End of year celebration. It was great to see old members, new members, colleagues, comrades at our end-of-year social gathering on Tuesday.  We have had a long year, and it was great to see friendly faces with happy voices, senses of humour, intelligence and wit. Noel spoke about the year that was and the year ahead, and Jennifer and Paul ran an excellent quiz (with a union theme). I’ve already forgotten who won.</p>
<p>Our take on 2023. We love what we do. We are all professionals with a strong commitment to public higher education. We value our academic freedom and insist on being able to exercise it.  No one works harder than academic and professional staff to ensure that students succeed and that their degrees and diplomas are earned and valued.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This year may have been long and challenging –what with bargaining and COVID; the sight of most other universities in Aotearoa resorting to cutting staff jobs in the face of financial difficulty; the rise of ChatGPT et al and the commensurate decline of academic integrity; the election of a coalition government which has been eager to show who is boss …</p>
</li>
<li><p>TEU members have made valuable contributions to larger university matters, on issues as diverse as the Curriculum Transformation project, Health and Safety, workload, and academic standards.</p>
</li>
<li><p>But we have to sustain our kaupapa: working to grow local union membership, delegate networks, and activism; standing with those in precarious positions; empathising with those struggling with illness or nonwork issues; supporting members in dealings with managers and HR; protecting those whose workload is seen to have few limits; etc...</p>
</li>
<li><p>Few things worry our senior management and HR more than a self-organised union workforce that is growing in number, in determination, and in strength.  Our branch grew to over 1500 members in 2023, and growing further must be a high priority in 2024. We will be here long after they have gone. Please continue to have discussions in your workplace that encourage non-members to see the material and social benefits that TEU membership offers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This was a year during which our employer oversaw regression rather than progress in some important areas. We reported last week on The 2023 Gender pay gap - The University of Auckland<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/equity-at-the-university/equity-information-for-staff/gender-equity/gender-pay-gap.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/equity-at-the-university/equity-information-for-staff/gender-equity/gender-pay-gap.html</a> which shows a GPG of 10.8% --more than two percentage points worse than the national average. But we should not forget the 2023 Employee Experience Survey<a href="https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/human-resources/university-culture-values/staff-surveys.html">https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/human-resources/university-culture-values/staff-surveys.html</a>. Inter alia, the survey revealed that only 32% of academic staff and 57% of professional staff (47% combined) think their workload is reasonable. What’s more, only 38% see any evidence of steps to ensure that workloads become more manageable.  More staff are not satisfied with their advancement opportunities than are satisfied. Nonbinary staff, rainbow staff and staff with disabilities each report even more negative experiences. Despite the active indigenisation of the university, workload satisfaction has declined for Māori staff to 33% and their belief in the purpose and aspirations of the university are down 12 percentage points. Less than half of Pacific staff feel their workload is reasonable, less than half feel energised to “go the extra mile,” and only 36% are satisfied with their advancement opportunities.  What’s more, we now work in an environment in which fewer than half of us (49%) feel that we can respectfully voice our opinions “without fear of any negative impact”. And it is much worse in some faculties.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can the TEU contribute to turning some of these sorry statistics around? We believe so. But we need to be invited to engage, or our membership needs to demand a place at the table.  Our employer prefers to marginalise and ignore us.  But increased strength --in number and voice-- will make this harder to do.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Branch Planning Day. Yesterday we had a branch planning day. We were very happy to welcome a number of delegates and supportive members from outside the branch committee.  We had a productive day, discussing the items noted above, as well as others (bargaining will resume in 2024). We co-opted two new members to the Branch committee: Koro Tawa and Brent Burmester, both from the Business School. We are very happy to have them join us. The branch and I also agreed that I would return to the co-Presidency (Academic) until the next AGM.</p>
<p>The Siouxsie Wiles case is not just about Siouxsie Wiles.  Earlier this week, an open letter, initiated by our colleagues Nicola Gaston, Virginia Braun, Cate Macinnis-Ng, and Helen Petousis-Harris and co-signed by 120 members of staff urged of the Council of the University of Auckland to provide immediate assurances regarding the safety of our colleagues engaged in their work for the university. (More details and the letter itself: More than 100 University of Auckland academics sign letter complaining of unsafe workplace - NZ Herald<a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/more-than-100-university-of-auckland-academics-sign-letter-complaining-of-unsafe-workplace/WKMJEFQSHFD3BC4BGXOI5XFYXY/">https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/more-than-100-university-of-auckland-academics-sign-letter-complaining-of-unsafe-workplace/WKMJEFQSHFD3BC4BGXOI5XFYXY/</a>). As of this morning, Council has not responded –or even acknowledged receipt of the letter.</p>

<p>Results of the 2023 Council, Senate, and committee elections. Congratulations to all the successful candidates. And commiserations to those who were not elected. There is next time.

<p>Academic staff, Israel-Palestine, and academic freedom. An open letter is circulating online within New Zealand universities on the impact of the Gaza-Israel horrors on academic freedom here and elsewhere.  The letter Open Letter on Academic Freedom - Google Docs<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pUJDs4B9l34NZr_orDLk3cHrfMRawM_aLrulDSWmg70/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pUJDs4B9l34NZr_orDLk3cHrfMRawM_aLrulDSWmg70/edit</a> is focussed primarily on the defence of academic freedom and states, in part, that such freedom “is an internationally recognised and legislative entitlement needed for teaching, learning, and research, particularly on contentious and contested topics. We stand together in condemning organisations that have sought to undermine this freedom in relation to the current situation in Israel and Palestine and we express our full solidarity with and support for educators and researchers who have faced attempts to inhibit and limit their scholarship on this topic.” Members are invited to read and add signatures if they wish.
