<p>Fair pay agreements are crucial in a variety of workplaces because, without them, employers can systematically drive wages ever lower. More than 200,000 workers (in transportation, education, food industry, inter alia) have benefitted recently and directly from fair pay agreements.  The incoming government, not surprisingly, wants to remove them. Please indicate your desire that wages and pay increase, not decline, by signing the petition run by the CTU -- Keep Fair Pay Coming - Together<a href="https://www.together.org.nz/keep_fair_pay_coming?utm_campaign=fpa_petition&utm_medium=email&utm_source=together">https://www.together.org.nz/keep_fair_pay_coming?utm_campaign=fpa_petition&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=together</a> -- and then share on social media.</p>
