<p>As we near the end of the year and the summer break, I am writing to share important news.  Both the news of our 5th placing in the 2024 QS Sustainability Ranking and the release of our inaugural Gender Pay Gap report are milestones that reflect, on the one hand, Waipapa Taumata Rau excellence – and on the other, where we must continue to strive to be excellent in all we do.</p>
<p>A big welcome to Education and Social Work Faculty staff who are making the much-anticipated move to the City Campus. We are thrilled to welcome you and your community to the City Campus. More information about the move can be found here<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/notices/2023/the-epsom-move.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/notices/2023/the-epsom-move.html</a>.</p>
<p>QS 2024 Sustainability rankings: 5th in the world, 1st in Oceania
Just months after being ranked 68th in the 2024 QS World University Rankings, Waipapa Taumata Rau has been ranked fifth in the world for sustainability and first in Oceania.</p>
<p>This is the second year the QS organisation has highlighted the role universities play in taking action to tackle the world’s greatest environmental, social and governance issues. Our fifth place has been assessed against 1403 tertiary institutions worldwide, while our first place in Oceania ranks us at the top of 46 institutions in New Zealand, Australia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>Congratulations to everyone across our academic and professional staff who have contributed to our sustainability work.</p>
<p>You can read more about the rankings on the News pages here<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2023/12/05/university-excels-in-2024-qs-sustainability-rankings.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2023/12/05/university-excels-in-2024-qs-sustainability-rankings.html</a>.</p>
<p>Gender Pay Gap Report 2023
Today, we publish the inaugural Gender Pay Gap report, part of our commitment to equity for staff.</p>
<p>The report shows an overall Gender Pay Gap (GPG) of 10.8 per cent, against a national average of 8.6 per cent. The report details gender pay gaps for academic and professional staff and those with and without permanent roles at the University. It also outlines the plan to include gender and ethnicity intersections in next year’s annual report.</p>
<p>The Pro Vice-Chancellor Equity, Professor Cathy Stinear, finalised the Gender Pay Gap Report in collaboration with the People and Culture portfolio. A sustainable plan for annual gender pay gap reporting has been developed, and next year’s report will include gender-ethnicity intersections. Key drivers of pay gaps, including the distribution of genders in senior roles and gender effects on performance pay, will be investigated and reported next year.</p>
<p>This report honours a commitment to Taumata Teitei - Vision 2030 and Strategic Plan 2025, recognising that improving data and insights is a core component of a ‘high performing, diverse, equitable and inclusive community.’</p>
<p>The findings are not acceptable and make it clear that new approaches are needed to address the gap. With data providing a detailed understanding of these pay gaps, and what perpetuates them, we will make renewed efforts to address structural and systemic issues.</p>
<p>More information, including a link to this year’s report, is available on the News pages here<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2023/12/06/pay-gap-report.html">https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2023/12/06/pay-gap-report.html</a>.</p>
<p>I am proud of what we have achieved and would like to acknowledge your work in taking our institution forward, in your commitment to excellence, and your efforts to challenge us to keep striving to be the best we can be for all.</p>
<p>Finally, please ensure you have time to enjoy some end-of-year celebrations, and I hope that you are able to take a restorative and restful break after another busy year.</p>
<p>Ka pai</p>
<p>Ngā mihi nui
