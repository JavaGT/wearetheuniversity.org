<p>Runners lace up for Campus 5km fun run and walk series</p>
<p>Runners and walkers wanting to make good on their new year’s fitness resolutions can join a Monday evening 5km course on campus at the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>The University is partnering with local running club Hamilton City Hawks to host a series of 5km run and walk events on campus.</p>
<p>The University’s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Roy Crawford, is pleased to welcome the run/walk series onto campus and says it’s a great way to engage with the local community.</p>
<p>“The University of Waikato has one of the most picturesque campuses in the country, so we’re looking forward to showcasing our campus to the community.”</p>
<p>“As we look forward to celebrating our 50th events taking place on campus. The campus run will be one of many opportunities to show people how the University is a vibrant part of the community, and we hope to see members of the community at other events during the year.”</p>
<p>Professor Brendan Hicks, from biological sciences, is one of several keen runners on staff at the University who are looking forward to the run/walk series.</p>
<p>A member of the Hamilton Hawks since 1992, Professor Hicks sees the events as a great way for members of the community to meet new people and get moving at the same time.</p>
<p>“It’s also good for people who don’t know there are running clubs out there – we’re always keen to welcome new members,” he says.</p>
<p>Starting Monday 17 February and running through to 7 April, the 5km course will take place on and around the University’s campus, starting and finishing on the Village Green.</p>
<p>Hamilton runners and walkers will be familiar with other Hawks runs. During daylight saving the club organises the Eastside Tavern 5k along the Waikato River on Tuesdays and the Smith and McKenzie run in Chartwell on Wednesdays.</p>
<p>Registration for each event is from 5.00pm each Monday, 17 February to 7 April, with a race start time of 6.00pm for runners, and walkers starting any time after they’ve registered. A $5 entry fee gains entrance to the event and a glass of beer, cider, house wine or a non-alcoholic drink at Momento Lakes at the end. Spot prizes are awarded each The Campus 5km fun run and walk is in association with the Hamilton City Hawks running club, Momento Café and Good George, and the Waikato Students’ Union (WSU).</p>
