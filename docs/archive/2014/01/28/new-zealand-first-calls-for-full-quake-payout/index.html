<p><strong>Tuesday, 28 January 2014, 7:23 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is calling on the Government to make a full buyout of properties owned by Christchurch residents who were not insured or owned bare sections.</p>
<p>Spokesperson on Canterbury Earthquake Issues Denis O’Rourke has written to Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee in support of the Quake Outcasts Group.</p>
<p>The group represents residents who were uninsured or owned bare sections when the earthquakes struck Canterbury and have only been eligible for a 50 per cent payout.</p>
<p>“Many properties had only minor damage, but residents are being forced to sell and move because they live in government declared red zones,” Mr O’Rourke said.</p>
<p>“The least the Government can do is buy the properties at the 2007 valuation offered to other red-zoned residents.</p>
<p>“The Government’s inaction has pushed the group into court action over the legality of the red zoning.</p>
<p>“The Government’s treatment of these property owners has been cruel.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First urges the Government to make a decision without delay. People should not be left waiting, Christmas came and went, and they are still in limbo.</p>
<p>“Mr Brownlee needs to consider that many Christchurch residents are staring into an uncertain future, their lives have been disrupted, they are anxious, stressed, and now he is making them fight for rights.</p>
<p>“No wonder New Zealand is being reviewed for its human rights, after the group made a submission to the United Nations.</p>
<p>“This is a major embarrassment for New Zealand.</p>
<p>“It is high time that the Government did the right thing and must now offer 100 per cent of the 2007 value of the land concerned.”</p>
