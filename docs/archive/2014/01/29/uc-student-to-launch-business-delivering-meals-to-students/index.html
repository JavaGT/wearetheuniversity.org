<p><strong>UC student to launch business delivering meals to students</strong></p>
<p>January 29, 2014</p>
<p>A University of Canterbury (UC) student will next month launch a business delivering meals to students.</p>
<p>Stefan Warnaar will provide ingredients and recipes once a week to make five meals, serving four adults at a time, through his website <a href="http://www.myfivemeals.co.nz">www.myfivemeals.co.nz</a>.</p>
<p>His business concept has been supported and nurtured by UC Innovators, run by Dr Rachel Wright.</p>
<p>Warnaar says the Christchurch student food delivery service opens February 5 and deliveries will be made every Sunday. The food for individual meals will cost around $6.50.</p>
<p>&quot;We deliver with cooler bins to keep the meat refrigerated. Our food will be approved by health and safety regulations and delivery is free for all orders.</p>
<p>&quot;We will make a profit working on low margins and selling five meals at once. Food is a low margin business and so volume is key.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a similar service in parts of the North Island although ours is aimed at regular families and students who want to eat well and stay on budget.</p>
<p>&quot;As a student I found cooking dinner a chore, but I love eating good food. Our service means students don’t have to spend time menu planning, shopping or budgeting every week.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be helping out during university O-Week starting February 17 promoting My Five Meals.</p>
<p>&quot;By allowing students to choose five meals from a selection of ten makes it simple to plan for the week. We will use higher quality cuts of meat.</p>

<p>&quot;All orders between February 5 and March 9 will receive a free copy of the new UC Students’ Association cookbook <em>Your on Dishes</em>. A few of the meals in the cookbook will be available as options on My Five Meals.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to make it simple to enjoy delicious and healthy meals and deliver the best New Zealand meat and produce to students.</p>
<p>&quot;My Five Meals aims to be a replacement for the supermarkets, not an exclusive premium option. We believe our costs are similar or better than the supermarkets. Our food comes from a range of established food wholesalers in Christchurch.&quot;</p>
<p>UC Innovators manager Dr Rachel Wright says it was exciting to see students grow, create, develop and realise their business dreams and ideas.</p>
<p>&quot;It is great to see how Stefan has identified a need among his fellow students and has worked out a fantastic solution that has the potential to transform a large number of flats,&quot; Dr Wright says.</p>
