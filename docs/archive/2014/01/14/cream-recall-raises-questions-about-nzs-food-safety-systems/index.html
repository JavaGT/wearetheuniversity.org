<p><strong>Cream recall raises questions about NZ’s food safety systems</strong></p>
<p>Questions will once again be raised about New Zealand’s food safety systems after Fonterra recalled thousands of containers of cream, Labour’s Primary Industries spokesperson Damien O’Connor says.</p>
<p>“Labour is concerned this recall once again tests the credibility of our food safety systems.</p>
<p>“Fonterra appears to have used the appropriate testing systems which picked up the dangerous bacteria E.Coli and have taken precautionary action, as is appropriate.</p>
<p>“However the timing of food testing and the accuracy of information provided to companies such as Fonterra needs further scrutiny.</p>
<p>“The Government has been spending hundreds of millions of dollars through its Primary Growth Partnership fund, yet areas of food safety and science continue to be under-resourced and not up to international best practise.</p>
<p>“New Zealand farmers will be rightly disappointed with this recall.</p>
<p>“Labour has consistently called for the independence of the Food Safety Authority, which is currently within the Government’s super ministry, the Ministry for Primary Industries.</p>
<p>“A stand-alone agency would ensure every level of food production can be accurately and independently monitored.</p>
<p>“Fonterra is our biggest company, food production is our biggest export and New Zealand cannot afford mistakes that can further damage our international reputation,” Damien O’Connor says.</p>
