<p>New plan to establish elite teachers ignores biggest hurdle to student success</p>
<p>Creating a new elite group of “change principals” and “expert teachers” misses the biggest reason children do not succeed at school - New Zealand&#39;s high rate of child poverty and deprivation.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa President Judith Nowotarski says the Prime Minister’s announcement of $395 million for new principal and teacher roles and allowances does not address the key<br>underlying causes of student underachievement - inequity and poverty.</p>
<p>Judith Nowotarski says the sector should have been consulted on the best way to use the new funding to support student learning.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, we would like to see better support for students with special needs, a reversal of cuts to early childhood education, better professional development for teachers and school support staff, and extra assistance for students struggling with literacy and numeracy.</p>
<p>“NZEI has been working with the Ministry of Education for a long time to develop a career pathway that keeps expert teachers in the classroom and welcomes recognition of the importance of quality teaching and leadership.”</p>
<p>However, Mrs Nowotarski says members are concerned that aspects of the package -such as parachuting highly paid change managers into struggling schools - had not worked overseas and could increase competition rather than collaboration.</p>
<p>“Creating sustainable change requires genuine collaboration with teachers. With &quot;change principals&quot; the government is again imposing a failed overseas experiment and putting ideology ahead of what will really work for children’s education.”</p>
