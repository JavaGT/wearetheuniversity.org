<p>Conference to explore property for resilient communities</p>
<p>Property provides the foundation and resources for virtually every part of our daily lives, and it contributes enormously to economies world-wide as a valuable asset base. From this Sunday 19 January, 100 participants from as far away as the United Kingdom, South Africa and Finland will descend on Lincoln University to attend the 20th Pacific Rim Real Estate Society annual conference.</p>
<p>Hosted by the Faculty of Commerce at Lincoln University, the 20th Pacific Rim Real Estate Society (PRRES) annual conference, from 19 to 22 January 2014, is bringing together industry professionals and academics to network and discuss the conference theme Resilient Communities: Providing for the Future.</p>
<p>“The 22 February 2011 earthquake had a devastating impact on property in Canterbury, with almost 1,000 buildings partially or fully demolished in the Christchurch central business district and thousands of residential properties red zoned. The Canterbury region provides a unique stage for property professionals and academics from around the world to see first-hand the challenges and opportunities available as we recover,” says conference chair and Lincoln University’s Professor of Property Studies, Sandy Bond.</p>
<p>The conference theme will focus on the provision of buildings, neighbourhoods and communities that are resilient, sustainable, safe, and healthy. It also seeks to cover a wide-range of research areas including property development, investment, education, management, valuation, and property markets in urban, regional and rural settings. Some 85 academic papers are being presented at the conference.</p>

<p>The keynote speakers include John Baen, Professor of Real Estate from the College of Business, University of North Texas whose paper is titled “Catastrophic Interruptions of Normal Property Cycles: The Path to Recovery through Persistence, Collective Individual Spirits and Actions”. John was instrumental in establishing PRRES back in 1990 before it became a society and was the first Professor of Property at Lincoln University.</p>
<p>Other keynotes are Dr Terence Boyd, another former LU Professor of Property, presenting on Property market analysis: the key to looking forward”; and Neil Crosby, Professor of Real Estate, University of Reading, presenting on “What have property valuations ever done for us?”</p>
<p>“A key aspect to this conference is the friendly and welcoming environment that includes student participation through a postgraduate student-only day on the Sunday,” says Sandy. “Students have been invited to this mentoring session to present their research to other students and to faculty staff who provide valuable feedback to enhance the learning experience.”  </p>
