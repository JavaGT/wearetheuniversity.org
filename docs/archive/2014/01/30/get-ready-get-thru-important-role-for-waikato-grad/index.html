<p>When a natural disaster strikes, being prepared can make all the difference.</p>
<p>Thanks to a degree majoring in Earth Sciences at the University of Waikato, graduate Kelly Newell understands the dynamics of natural disasters and how they affect communities.</p>
<p>She is now using that expertise to prepare the Waikato for such events in her role as a Local Civil Defence Emergency Management Coordinator for the Waikato District Council.</p>
<p>“Within the council, my role is to build and maintain an emergency operations centre (EOC) that can be activated to respond to an emergency in the district. I also coordinate civil defence staff to be prepared to respond to emergencies and work in the EOC,” says Kelly.</p>
<p>In the community, Kelly encourages people living in the Waikato to be prepared for an emergency through individual household emergency plans and community response planning.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to assist our communities in responding to and coping with a disaster, and helping them to return to normal as soon as possible afterwards.”</p>
<p>Kelly’s journey before choosing Waikato University began at Ngaruawahia High School, followed by time in the Royal New Zealand Airforce.</p>
<p>“I thought about attending university for some time before I finally did it. It’s not an easy decision leaving full-time employment to go to university, but I’m really pleased I did it and have had no regrets.”</p>
