<p>Nanaia<br>MAHUTA</p>
<p>MP for Hauraki-Waikato</p>
<p>17 January 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Alcohol laws need further improvement</strong></p>
<p>Young people’s access to ready to drink mixes (RTDs) is too easy says Labour’s Hauraki –Waikato MP Nanaia Mahuta</p>
<p>Ms Mahuta says this needs to change after she attended a briefing with Police regarding an incident involving an intoxicated 9-yr old in Hamilton. Three people have been prosecuted for supplying a minor with alcohol without parental consent.</p>
<p>“There is no silver bullet to the problems involving minors gaining access to alcohol but prosecuting those who do supply will send a strong message to adults and communities that this is unacceptable.</p>
<p>“We were informed that while there is no’ quick fix’ to the increasing scourge of alcohol related incidents involving youth.</p>
<p>“It must be remembered that the Government did not accept Labour’s proposal to ban RTDs but this extreme incident is a timely reminder about the damaging effects of RTDs which have an alcohol content of up to 12 per cent.</p>
<p>“The whole incident has raised the need for parents to be diligent about the whereabouts of their children.</p>
<p>“In addition to this, we were advised that the Police worked collaboratively with CYFs to ensure the young boy at the centre of the incident, his sibling and mother were being supported through this process.</p>
<p>“The prosecution of three people will be a test case to see how effective a fine is in discouraging adults supplying minors with alcohol. This may well be an area of further reform.</p>
<p>“She said Labour continued to call for the full implementation of the Law Commission recommendations to improve alcohol law reform.”</p>
