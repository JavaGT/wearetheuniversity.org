<p><strong>Friday, 17 January 2014, 2:29 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga</strong><br>MP for Maungakiekie</p>
<p><strong>17 January 2014 Media Statement</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maungakiekie MP welcomes further assistance to Tonga</strong></p>
<p>“I welcome the announcement of further assistance to Tonga. This support is much needed and I acknowledge our Government’s commitment during this natural disaster,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
<p>The Government today announced it will supply 300 emergency shelter kits, assist the New Zealand and Tongan Red Cross with the provision of clean water on the islands of Ha’apai, and provide $300,000 to New Zealand non-government organisations working with partners on the ground.</p>
<p>An NZDF C-130 will deliver the relief that are urgently required by the Tongan authorities to Nuku’alofa this afternoon.</p>
<p>“It is great to see the package of support now totalling $500,000. I am also humbled by the outpouring of generosity from New Zealanders and local businesses like Matson, Centra Forklifts and Steelpipe who are assisting with containers of aid. These are local businesses supporting local people and their families in Tonga,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.</p>
<p>“The three containers of basic necessities, taking 100 drums each, were filled almost immediately. They depart for Tonga on Monday and will take two weeks to arrive. I am working with the Ha’apai Relief Committee on three additional containers, which will depart later in the week.</p>
<p>“The NZ Tongan community has rallied together en masse to support the relief efforts back home. Many have spent hundreds and even thousands of dollars, this is community in action at its finest.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
<p>Notes: The C-130 has a full load (including additional fuel so not to deplete Tongan fuel reserves), unfortunately there was no room for other goods that people may wish to send.</p>
