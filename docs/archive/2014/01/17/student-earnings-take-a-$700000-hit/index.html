<p><strong>Friday, 17 January 2014, 3:40 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students'_Association">Otago University Students&#39; Association</a></strong></p>
<p><em>For immediate release</em></p>
<p><strong>Student Earnings Take a $700,000 Hit</strong></p>
<p>Students in Otago struggled to find work during 2013 and that’s resulted in a $700,000 drop in earnings for the region’s students throughout the year. Figures released by the free student recruitment and placement service - Student Job Search – show that numbers were down in all key areas. </p>
<p>“Seeing such a big drop from 2012 to 2013 is disheartening for students, especially with the cuts to student support.” Says Ruby Sycamore-Smith, 2014 OUSA President. “Students want to work, and if the jobs aren’t there then it‘s going to make for another tough year.”</p>
<p>The figures show students earned $7,353,136 in 2013 down nine percent from $8,051,814 in 2012. Students placed in work and the weeks worked also took four and five percent reductions respectively, while the average earned per placement also decreased four percent from $1,848 to $1,766.</p>
<p>“The Dunedin North electorate has the third highest rate of part-time employment in New Zealand, and at the back bone of this are students.” Says Sycamore-Smith, “We’ll continue to promote the Student Job Search service in 2014, now let’s hope the economy picks up.”</p>
<p>Student Job Search is a free service for students and for businesses or individuals to list jobs from one offs to full time. More information can be found at <a href="http://www.sjs.co.nz">www.sjs.co.nz</a></p>
