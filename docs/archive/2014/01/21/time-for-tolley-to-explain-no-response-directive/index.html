<p><strong>Tuesday, 21 January 2014, 11:55 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Time for Tolley to explain no response directive</p>
<p>Claims that Government cuts have put pressure on police to save resources by not pursuing and prosecuting cases require an immediate response from Anne Tolley, Labour’s Police spokesperson Jacinda Ardern says.</p>
<p>Her comments follow concerns raised by Otago University law expert, Mark Henaghan, about reports that a neighbour of Dunedin man, Edward Livingstone, told police about threats made by Livingstone, yet the complaint was allegedly never followed up.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Henaghan has raised the wider concern that prosecutors and some police are being told not to pursue cases because of a lack of resources.</p>
<p>“While I have heard similar stories, finding evidence of what are allegedly verbal instructions is difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;What we do know is that the police are being asked to do more with less. They have fewer staff and vehicles, a smaller training budget, fewer support staff, and a number of stations have been closed.</p>
<p>&quot;In real terms, the Police budget has been reduced. It would be disturbing if that has resulted in management telling officers not to pursue cases.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time Ms Tolley acknowledged the impact her Government has had on the police force. It is an absolute neglect of her duties to cut the Police budget in real terms, and then claim the resulting fallout is operational and not her responsibility.</p>
<p>&quot;The buck has to stop somewhere. It&#39;s time for the Minister to front and answer some tough questions.&quot;</p>
