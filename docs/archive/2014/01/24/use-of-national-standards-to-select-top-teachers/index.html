<p>Disgust over use of National Standards to select “top” teachers</p>
<p>Reports today that National Standards will be used as the benchmark to select and review the performance of an elite group of expert teachers and principals has appalled educators.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa President Judith Nowotarski said National Standards data remained invalid and unreliable. An NZCER survey published last November found only 7 percent of principals thought they were robust.</p>
<p>“National Standards outcomes do not show the true educational progress of a student and are therefore an absurd and insulting way to identify great teachers.</p>
<p>“Linking large pay bonuses for teachers to narrow student outcomes in this way<br>risks ‘teaching to the standard’, as well as making unfair judgements about teachers of students with special needs or learning difficulties.”</p>
<p>Yesterday the Prime Minister announced the creation of financial incentives for<br>approximately 6000 teachers and principals, with the aim of raising student achievement – a move that fails to address the inequity and poverty that are the key cause of student underachievement.</p>
<p>Ms Nowotarski said this policy was clearly not thought through.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister has rushed to create ‘good news’ ahead of creating sound policy. He needs to come clean with the full details of this scheme,” she said.</p>
