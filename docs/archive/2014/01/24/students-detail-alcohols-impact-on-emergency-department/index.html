<p><strong>Summer Students detail alcohol’s impact on Emergency Department</strong></p>
<p>University of Otago, Christchurch (UOC), Summer Students will today (Friday) present the results of their research projects – including two about alcohol’s impact on the Christchurch Hospital Emergency Department (ED).</p>
<p>Every year about 45 students take part in UOC’s Summer Studentship programme. Students work on specific projects with senior researchers for 10 weeks over the summer period.</p>
<p>This year two students worked with UOC emergency medicine Professor Mike Ardagh to gather up-to-date information on alcohol and the ED.</p>
<p>They found:<br>• Alcohol contributed to almost a third of ED attendances during the Saturday 11pm – 8am Sunday shift.<br>• More than 80% of patients who were alcohol-affected group had been ‘binging’.<br>• The median number of drinks consumed was 14 standard drinks.<br>• Eighty-eight per cent of alcohol-affected patients had consumed drinks from an off-licence.<br>• Wine and beer bought from supermarkets accounted for 20% of all alcohol consumed before admission. Supermarkets were the source of 67% of all off-licence beer and wine.</p>
<p>The two students collected data between 15 November and 9 December 2013. Between them they spent two weeks at ED, 24/7.</p>
<p>Five per cent of admissions during this time (182 of 3619 people) attended with alcohol as a contributing factor.</p>
<p>Professor Ardagh says this detailed snapshot of the impact of alcohol on the workload of the Emergency Department is a very useful addition to our understanding. It shows the impact is even greater than was suggested by data routinely recorded by medical and nursing staff and it paints a picture of the drinking patterns leading to an Emergency Department presentation. Data of this sort should inform the development of local alcohol policies.<br>Study:<br><a href="http://img.scoop.co.nz/media/pdfs/1401/Summerstudentalcohol1.docx">Summerstudentalcohol1.docx</a></p>
