<p><strong>New field guide proves popular</strong></p>
<p>A field guide for New Zealand native plants was launched last week by University of Waikato ecologist Catherine Kirby, with support from the Environmental Research Institute.</p>
<p>The Field Guide to New Zealand’s Epiphytes, Vines and Mistletoes details 103 species of epiphytes (plants that perch on other plants), vines (climbing plants) and mistletoes (parasitic plants) over 261 pages. The introduction and nine chapters are accompanied by 320 photos, 123 taken by Catherine and the remainder contributed by a group of 43 photographers.</p>
<p>Developing the field guide was an interesting journey for Catherine who did everything herself, from compiling species descriptions through to the page layout. “I‘m grateful for the opportunity to craft this book from scratch. There have been so many people who have helped me along the way and it has been a great learning curve.”</p>
<p>Over 70 people attended the book launch, held on campus last Thursday 11 December.</p>
<p>Since October 200 books have been sold, including 60 on the night of the launch, which were proudly signed by the author. The field guide was printed by Print House Ltd in Frankton who are also managing orders through the Best Little Bookstore.</p>
<p>Director of the Environmental Research Institute, Professor Bruce Clarkson says this book is a good example of how to effectively communicate research results to the public.</p>
<p>“The field guide developed out of Catherine’s interest in epiphytes which emerged during and after her Master of Science thesis research. She has shown great tenacity to keep the project going on the side of her contracted research outputs over the last three years. The final product is a credit to her hard work and at this rate the book seems likely to sell out within six months, so there may be a need for a second edition,” says Prof Clarkson.</p>
