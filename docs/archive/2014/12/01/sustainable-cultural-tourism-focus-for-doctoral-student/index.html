<p><strong>Sustainable cultural tourism focus for doctoral student</strong></p>
<p>Research highlighting the significance of sustainable cultural tourism is the objective for University of Waikato PhD candidate Mei Cooper.</p>
<p>The distinction between tourism alone and sustainable cultural tourism – which prioritises the wellbeing of indigenous communities, cultural preservation and conserving the natural environment while providing economic returns to tribes – is important for Mei.</p>
<p>She says tourism can potentially exploit the natural environment and host communities, contradicting those values she holds important as a Māori woman researcher.</p>
<p>“But now I think we can turn that around and we can use tourism to determine our own future through sustainable cultural tourism.”</p>
<p>Mei – from Ngaruawahia - will be doing her bit to achieve that over the next three years as she completes her doctorate at the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>She is the recipient of a Te Kotahi Research Institute Doctoral Scholarship, worth up to $85,000, and is researching whether tribal investment in sustainable cultural tourism along the Waikato River will improve the tribal wellbeing of Waikato-Tainui.</p>
<p>She will also carry out case studies at Te Awamārahi, Tūrangawaewae and Maungatautari Marae, chosen for their location along the Waikato River.</p>
<p>“Tourism is one of New Zealand’s leading industries and plays a growing role in the New Zealand economy. Sustainable cultural tourism can help us regenerate our language and culture,” she says.</p>

<p>She says many Māori tourism ventures are simply investments in tourism businesses.</p>
<p>“I’m from Waikato-Tainui and a lot of our tourism investments are commercially driven, such as the Ibis and Novotel hotels in Hamilton and Auckland Airport,” she says.</p>
<p>“It should also be about the natural environment, our culture and the people. I want to provide a framework for Māori to develop a design that will work for them. Sustainable cultural tourism can provide employment at all different levels for the people and marae can be run like sustainable businesses.”</p>
<p>She wants her completed work to provide a guide for marae looking to investigate sustainable cultural tourism.</p>
<p>“This research will use a bottom-up approach working with Māori at grassroots level to design a structure unique to each marae. I want this research to be practical, easy to use and useful to all iwi and other indigenous people throughout the world.”</p>
<p>Mei is nearing the completion of her first year of her doctorate, studying through the Waikato Management School with guidance from the School of Māori and Pacific Development.</p>
<p>She is currently developing her project by working with government departments such as the Ministry of Tourism and Te Puni Kōkiri before visiting marae to carry out case studies.</p>
<p>“I am very lucky to have this scholarship and I want to contribute back to our people in any positive way,” she says.</p>
