<p><strong>Victoria University academic first in New Zealand to receive international fellow award for management consulting</strong></p>
<p>Victoria University academic, Stephen Cummings, is the first New Zealander to become an International Council of Management Consulting Institutes (ICMCI) Academic Fellow.</p>
<p>The award is a mark of distinction which recognises academics internationally who have contributed to the study and teaching of management consultancy. The fellowship was announced today by the Institute of Management Consultants (IMC) New Zealand.</p>
<p>Stephen Cummings is Professor of Strategic Management at Victoria University where he teaches strategy on both the undergraduate and MBA programmes. He has been instrumental in establishing a partnership between Victoria Business School and IMC New Zealand to bridge the gap between consulting and academia.</p>
<p>“It’s fantastic to see Professor Cummings acknowledged internationally for his outstanding contribution to the management consulting profession,” says IMC New Zealand Immediate Past President, Phil Guerin.</p>
<p>“IMC New Zealand exists to promote professional standards and codes of conduct for management consulting in New Zealand, and so it’s really important to have strong links with academics teaching those who will go on to work in the consulting industry, such as MBA students.”</p>
<p>He says IMC New Zealand and Victoria University regularly hold joint forums bringing together managers, consultants, lecturers and MBA students.</p>
