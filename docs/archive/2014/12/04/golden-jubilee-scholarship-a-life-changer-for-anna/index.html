<p><strong>Golden Jubilee Scholarship a life-changer for Anna</strong></p>
<p>Anna Caudwell describes being awarded a Golden Jubilee Scholarship from the University of Waikato as a life-changing experience.</p>
<p>“I was over the moon when I heard I’d got the scholarship,” she says. “It’s probably the happiest I’d ever been. It’s life-changing and such a great opportunity.”</p>
<p>Golden Jubilee Scholarships were awarded for 2015 as part of the University&#39;s 50th anniversary. They were given to 10 school-leavers who demonstrated a high level of academic excellence, leadership potential and community citizenship.</p>
<p>More than 200 students applied for the scholarship, which is worth up to $40,000, and as part of the programme, scholars will have opportunities to develop leadership skills through a tailored leadership programme.<br>From Otaki, Anna is a year 13 boarder at Feilding High School and is looking forward to starting at Waikato next year.</p>
<p>“I’m ready for the next phase of my life, new experiences, meeting other people and getting into economics and accounting.”</p>
<p>Before being awarded the scholarship, Anna had been looking at studying at either Waikato or Victoria universities.</p>
<p>“But once I heard I had the scholarship, I knew I was coming to Waikato.”</p>
<p>Anna is enrolled at Waikato Management School in a Bachelor of Management Studies majoring in accounting and economics. She plans to become a chartered accountant and work in New Zealand before eventually heading overseas.</p>

<p>While at high school, Anna held several leadership positions. She was the Manawatu Youth Ambassador (community volunteer) and treasurer on the school council. She was a prefect in the L J Wild House school hostel, a house officer, netball coach and tutor for accounting and statistics.</p>
<p>She says the experience gained from these positions helped her understand how to be a successful and effective leader while also helping those around her.</p>
<p>“These positions have taught me how to work effectively in a team, and also built my confidence enough to be able to work individually on certain projects. I have learnt to speak up with my opinions and ideas, but to also be quiet and respectful when somebody else is presenting theirs. I have become more aware of those and the problems of those around me and how to help and assist those in need.”</p>
