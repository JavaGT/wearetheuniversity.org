<p>22 December 2014 MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p><strong>Save Saddle Hill Petition Launched</strong></p>
<p>A petition to save the historic landmark of Saddle Hill from continuous quarrying has been launched by Dunedin South MP Clare Curran today.</p>
<p>The petition urges the Dunedin City Council (DCC) to appeal to the Environment Court for an urgent Stop Work Order on the quarrying of Jaffray’s Hill, the lower hump of Saddle Hill.</p>
<p>The petition also asks that the DCC engage with the Saddle Hill community in discussions over the future protection and ownership of the landmark.</p>
<p>“Saddle Hill is far more than just a hill. It is a landmark of significant cultural and historical importance, woven into local tales and legends. According to Māori legend, Saddle Hill is the final resting place of the Taieri taniwha. What’s more, Saddle Hill is one of only two areas in Otago that Captain Cook named himself on his Voyage of Discovery,” Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>“But all of this is under threat, as the ridgeline that makes it so unique looks to be increasingly volatile due to continuous quarrying,” said Clare Curran.</p>
<p>“This petition was one of the outcomes of a standing-room only community meeting I held earlier this month. Saddle Hill residents need an answer. The protracted legal process -which saw the Environment Court declare that no consent for the digging exists, a decision subsequently overturned by the High Court- has left a cloud of uncertainty as to the landmark’s future,” Clare Curran said.</p>

<p>“I have launched this petition in order to provide a voice for Saddle Hill residents and the wider community. The DCC needs to front up and take action on this matter. The Council has the ability to request an urgent Stop Work Order to temporarily protect the landmark from further quarrying,” Clare Curran said.</p>
<p>“But community engagement is crucial. And that’s why the petition calls for more long-term discussions between the DCC and Saddle Hill residents. By signing this petition, a clear message will be sent to the DCC that Saddle Hill must be protected,” Clare Curran said.</p>
