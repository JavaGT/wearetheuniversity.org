<p>Canterbury summer student numbers surging</p>
<p>December 10, 2014</p>
<p>University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says it is heartening to see more than 1000 students enrolled in the university’s summer courses.</p>
<p>``This means we are now well ahead of last year’s numbers at a similar time. I hope this is an indication of growth in enrolments for 2015. An increase in first-year students this year showed the University is on track for future growth,’’ Dr Carr says.</p>
<p>``The summer courses are important to us because they allow some students to complete their degrees and other students to catch up or get ahead. With over 2000 post graduate students and 1000 summer school students, no longer can it be said the University is only a two semester institution. Our research goes on year round and more than ever our students are on campus year round.</p>
<p>``We have always known that rebuilding student numbers would not be a one-year project and further efforts will be required in this area as we strive toward our first post-quake operating surplus by the end of 2017. The overall numbers of students in 2014 are largely in line with budget expectations and the University is committed to providing students with world-class learning opportunities.</p>
<p>``The Government investment in the University of up to $260 million has signalled a period of significant development on campus. We are all proud of this achievement and of all the work that has been done over the past four years to get the University to where it is today.</p>

<p>``Applications to enrol for new to UC international students have increased substantially compared with this time last year. Not all the applications will turn into enrolled students, but there is a renewed level of interest from international and first year domestic students.</p>
<p>``We will not know the exact number of students for next year until about the first week of March, but signs are promising.</p>
<p>``We have graduated more than 12,000 students and enrolled more than 10,000 new students since the earthquakes. Nearly a third of our students have gone on to study at postgraduate level at UC or at universities around the world. We are in the top three universities in New Zealand for student course and programme completion rates, retention within study and progression to higher levels of study.</p>
<p>``UC has retained its position in the top three per cent of the world’s universities and we are the first New Zealand university to have a five-star rating from the international university ranking research company QS.’’</p>
<p>Dr Carr says an exciting highlight planned for 2015 will be the start of construction of the university’s $212 million new Rutherford Science and Innovation Centre as well as $145 million of work that has already begun on completely remediating or replacing engineering facilities including a completely new structural engineering laboratory and laboratories for chemical and processing engineering.</p>
<p>``We’re looking forward to a fantastic 2015 and an increase in student enrolments. Canterbury is such a great place for students. There is something extra special right now about Christchurch and Canterbury,’’ Dr Carr says.</p>
<p>The total number of students enrolled in 107 courses is 1033, which is more than at the same time last year and the year before.</p>
