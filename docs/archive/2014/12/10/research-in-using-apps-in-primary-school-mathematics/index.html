<p><strong>Important funding for research in using apps in primary school mathematics</strong></p>
<p>Nearly $200,000 has been granted by the Teaching and Learning Research Initiative (TLRI) to support a research project on how to improve teaching and learning of primary mathematics through the use of applications (apps) on mobile digital devices. The research is run by Dr Nigel Calder and Dr Carol Murphy, both Senior Lecturers based at the University of Waikato’s Tauranga Faculty of Education. A partnership has been established with Tahatai Coast Primary School, Papamoa and Te Akau Ki Papamoa Primary School. Glen Storey, Monique Storey and Rebekah Whyte are the teachers involved as co-researchers.</p>
<p>By investigating the influence of using apps on students’ mathematical learning, a framework can be constructed to evaluate and inform teaching decisions about the use of apps to improve students’ conceptual understanding. The outline will then support teacher professional learning and development in mathematics pedagogy.</p>
<p>The main outcome aims at identifying the best practice which then can be introduced to schools and teachers initially in the Bay of Plenty and Waikato before being presented nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>The Teaching and Learning Research Initiative seeks to improve the links between educational research and teaching practices to improve outcomes for learners.</p>
