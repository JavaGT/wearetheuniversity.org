<p><strong>Future looks bright after scholarship win</strong></p>
<p>He lives and breathes software development and with a Golden Jubilee Scholarship from the University of Waikato, Nicholas Humphries is soon to start a Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) specialising in software engineering.</p>
<p>The University awarded 10 Golden Jubilee Scholarships for 2015 as part of its 50th anniversary. The scholarships were given to school-leavers from throughout New Zealand who demonstrated a high level of academic excellence, leadership potential and community citizenship.</p>
<p>More than 200 students applied for the scholarship, which is worth up to $40,000. As part of the programme, scholars will have opportunities to develop leadership skills through a tailored leadership programme.</p>
<p>Nick found out he’d been awarded the scholarship when he returned home from a four-day tramp. His dad, who got the call while Nick was away, kept it a secret until he returned home so the rest of the family was there to see his reaction.</p>
<p>“I knew something was up when we got home because the house was overly clean and everyone was looking a little suspicious,” says Nick. “When they told me, I had to do a double-take and was very overwhelmed, ecstatic and in disbelief. I don&#39;t think my excitement calmed down for quite a few weeks, in fact it is still there.”</p>
<p>And while Hamilton will be a big change from Te Anau, Nick says he is looking forward to making the move north.</p>
<p>“Coming from small-town Te Anau, it will be exciting to meet more like-minded people. I’m especially looking forward to the culture at Waikato University as it is so different to here. I look forward to next year and a huge thank you to Waikato uni for this amazing opportunity.”</p>

<p>Becoming a software engineer has been an aspiration of Nick’s for most of his time at Fiordland College, where he is the head boy.</p>
<p>“My interest in this area began in a year 8 computer studies class where I learnt that computers use a computer language to function. From there I started creating websites, teaching myself Java from YouTube tutorials, and eventually getting to the stage now where I can develop professional websites and mobile applications for both Android and iOS.</p>
<p>Along with teaching students the more technical side of computers, Nick also helps older members of his community with their computers, and earlier this year he created an app to assist New Zealanders quit smoking. This app was the Supreme Winner in the ‘It’s My Life’ competition.</p>
