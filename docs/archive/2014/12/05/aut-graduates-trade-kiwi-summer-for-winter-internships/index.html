<p><strong>AUT University graduates trade Kiwi summer for winter internships</strong></p>
<p>The kiwi summer is on hold for 10 AUT University graduates as they trade swimsuits for business suits and make the switch to working life inside a global organisation in the USA.</p>
<p>The soon-to-be graduates from a range of degree programmes have been hand-picked by companies based in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The graduates will take up residence from January 2015 in businesses that align with their area of study, including Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Westpac Americas in New York and Paramount Recording Studios in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The AUT interNZ International Scholarship Programme, now in its second year, is the first programme of its type for a New Zealand University. It is designed to help transition and fast-track graduates into the world of work through full immersion in a new market and culture.</p>
<p>AUT University’s Vice Chancellor Derek McCormack says: “We saw the need to create more opportunities for New Zealand’s young achievers to tune and expand their capability through the experience of working and living in a global market and different culture. We started the <em>AUT interNZ</em> programme in the United States – a significant world market – with the aim of extending it to other parts of the world.</p>
<p>_“_Through the <em>AUT interNZ</em> programme our graduates have a unique opportunity to develop both their technical and soft skills in ways that are sure to be attractive and beneficial to employers anywhere in the world,” says Mr McCormack.</p>

<p>Each scholarship includes an eight to 12 week placement with an industry host, return travel to the destination city, a 12-month US visa, travel and health insurance, plus an allowance for basic living costs.</p>
<p>The 2015 <em>AUT interNZ</em> industry host partners are:<br>• Westpac Americas, New York<br>• Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, New York<br>• Play Ruby USA, New York<br>• Red Antler, New York<br>• Public Restaurant<br>• AvroKO Hospitality Group, New York<br>• Zolfo Cooper, New York<br>• Paramount Recording Studios, Los Angeles<br>• Booktrack @ Kiwi Landing Pad, San Francisco</p>
<p>Last year, nine AUT interNZ scholarships were awarded. Two-thirds of the 2014 recipients are still in the US making the most of their one-year US visa through extensions to their internships or working in their industry sector.</p>
