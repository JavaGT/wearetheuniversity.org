<p><strong>Ron Mark MP</strong></p>
<p>Spokesperson for Defence<br>18 DECEMBER 2014  </p>
<p><strong>Brownlee’s Misplaced War on Acronyms</strong></p>
<p>The beleaguered Minister of Defence who reportedly cannot tell an RFL (required fitness level) from an AWQ (annual weapons qualification) has declared war on military acronyms while proving the proverb about those in glass houses.</p>
<p>“We feel sorry for the Minister at New Zealand First, so our MPs who are ex-military are offering to help him tell the difference between an ANZAC frigate and an OPV (Offshore Patrol Vessel),” says New Zealand First Defence Spokesperson Ron Mark.</p>
<p>“Perhaps he asked to go to the LAV but instead of a lavatory was taken out to a Light Armoured Vehicle. It seems a bit OTT (over the top) and inefficient to write in full Australia and New Zealand Army Corps each time ANZAC is used.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t he also the Minister responsible for CERA (Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority) and such things as LURP’s (Land Use Recovery Plan) and RRZ’s (Residential Red Zones)?</p>
<p>“In Parliament, he is also quick to use GDP (Gross Domestic Product) or to talk about the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development).</p>
<p>“Then again he is also a Minister of Defence who openly admits he doesn’t know what the NZDF (New Zealand Defence Force) gets up to.</p>
<p>“Our brave men and women frankly deserve a Minister of Defence not silliness over acronyms.</p>
<p>“So here are three for you Minister and I suggest you look them up; WIA, CASEVAC and KIA.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First knows elements of the Army are preparing for an Iraqi deployment in late February/early March and rumour has it that an advance party has left to undertake a recce (reconnaissance) in Iraq.</p>
<p>“As our young men and women take Christmas leave, it is absolutely shameful their Minister and Prime Minister are not allowing them to be open with their own families,” says Mr Mark.</p>
