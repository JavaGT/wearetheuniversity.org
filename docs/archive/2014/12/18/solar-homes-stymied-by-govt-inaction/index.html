<p><strong>Solar homes stymied by Govt inaction</strong></p>
<p>Government inaction is allowing the big power companies to discourage the nascent solar power sector, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>Green Party MP Gareth Hughes launched a petition today calling on the Government to empower the Electricity Authority to act as an independent umpire that will set fair, reasonable buy-back rates for solar power generation.</p>
<p>“Establishing an independent umpire to set a fair buy-back price would assist the thousands of Kiwis wanting to go solar, making it easier for families to generate their own clean power and to receive a certain price for it,” said Green Party energy spokesperson Gareth Hughes.</p>
<p>“We can support clean solar energy without subsidies, by simply empowering the Electricity Authority to set a fair and reasonable buy-back rate.</p>
<p>“Small-scale solar is growing fast, up a phenomenal 330 percent over the last two years. However savage cuts to the buy-back rate paid by Meridian and Contact Energy will stop this fast-growing sector in its tracks.</p>
<p>“It is hard for prospective solar investors to make long-term investments in solar panels when the power companies can change the buy-back terms with only 30 days’ notice.”</p>
<p>Meridian and Contact Energy recently announced a dramatic 50-70 percent cut in the rate they buy excess solar power from homes and businesses.</p>
<p>“Meridian and Contact have used their market power to act unfairly towards those who are investing in solar,” said Mr Hughes.</p>

<p>“It is time the Government broke the monopoly behaviour of our power companies and established an independent umpire to set a fair rate for buying surplus energy from small-scale producers.</p>
<p>“A simple, empowering law change is all that’s needed,” said Mr Hughes.</p>
