<p><strong>University of Canterbury signs substantial contract to redevelop engineering precinct</strong></p>
<p>December 3, 2014</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury today signed a substantial contract with Hawkins Construction for the first major redevelopment of the campus’s engineering precinct in more than 40 years.</p>
<p>The construction project, Canterbury Engineering the Future (CETF), will start immediately to ensure New Zealand’s best College of Engineering retains and improves its world ranking.</p>
<p>Engineering is the University of Canterbury’s most recognised discipline with civil and structural engineering currently ranked 19th in the world by the QS world university rankings. Civil engineering at the university is ranked third in the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>The CETF project will expand and fully modernise the College of Engineering, with work scheduled to be completed by the start of the 2017 academic year. The project will strengthen and refurbish three of the buildings which make up the University’s Engineering precinct, namely mechanical engineering, civil and natural resources engineering, and electrical and computer engineering.</p>
<p>The old chemical and process engineering wing will be demolished, the current core of the complex will be expanded and a new chemical and process engineering wing and the structural engineering laboratory will be built.</p>
<p>Although the buildings of the College of Engineering were damaged during the earthquakes, in addition some were old and not entirely fit for modern purpose. The university proposes to substantially refurbish and redevelop 18 buildings compromising over 40,000 square metres of space which make up the engineering precinct to ensure the University remains at the forefront of research and teaching well into the 21st century.</p>

<p>The University of Canterbury is spending in excess of $145 million on the revamp of the engineering facilities on campus over the next three years, following support from Government for up to $260 million for two major programmes of work in science and engineering.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says the campus redevelopment is intimately linked with one of the most exciting large scale citywide programmes of work in the history of New Zealand. It will attract more students and researchers to come and study and work here and we will be in a very strong position to provide increased highly skilled workforce and expertise for the city, the region, the nation and the world.

<p>“Our world status in engineering is in part due to the amazing pedigree of innovation and quality teaching, and partly because of the opportunities the Christchurch rebuild has offered for ground-breaking research as well as our expertise in power supply safety and energy sustainability, smart sensors for the city, human interface technologies, robotics, materials technologies, engineering project management, geotechnical engineering and information technology.</p>
<p>“Engineering at Canterbury is perfectly placed in a city reinventing itself and our graduates and staff have all the skills required to be deeply involved in the future of the city. This is an exceptional opportunity for us and we plan to ensure our local community gains the maximum benefit from our presence. It is not surprise that the 2014 engineering intermediate class is the largest in the history of the University and the number of students in the College is back to pre-2010 levels.</p>
<p>“Not many engineering faculties in Europe and North America have transitioned to 21st century learning and research environments and this investment would put New Zealand at the forefront for engineering education.</p>
<p>“We have a great track record of engineering at UC but having all our facilities modernised will really make a difference. This will enable us to carry out teaching, learning and research in facilities fit for the 21st century. The flexibility of our teaching spaces will be a feature of our state of the art modernisation,” Dr Carr says.</p>
<p>Hawkins chief executive Geoff Hunt says this project is significant for the university community and his company.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have been appointed as main contractor on this important project. For us, long-term relationships always deliver more for everyone involved, and collaboration consistently ensures stronger solutions. We have worked alongside the University for the last four years and we have seen how a common understanding can provide responsive services that are tailored to exceed the university’s objectives.”</p>
