<p><strong>What’s more important - diet or exercise?</strong></p>
<p>A free nutrition symposium hosted at Massey University’s Albany campus on Thursday poses the question: Which is more important – diet or physical exercise?</p>
<p>It is the latest in a series of nutrition symposia translating nutrition research findings into useful, accessible information for people interested in health, nutrition, food and wellness.</p>
<p>Dietitian Miriam Mullard will outline core components of effective weight loss programmes. She says it’s a matter of setting up a sustainable, tailored and integrated approach to lifestyle change.</p>
<p>“People have a variety of reasons why they need to be careful with their diets – some may have allergies or intolerances, others may have weight management issues, and be either underweight or overweight. There is so much conflicting advice out there, so a tailored approach to food is necessary,” she says.</p>
<p>Sport psychology lecturer Warrick Wood will reveal how harnessing motivation can influence physical activity. He says regular exercise has more than just a physical effect on people.</p>
<p>“There are more than just physical benefits to exercising. If you’re exercising with a group of other people – in team sports or training for an individual event – there’s the socialisation aspect, and the encouragement you receive from the group as you strive for your exercise goals,” he says. “It is important that we prescribe an integrated programme that is aligned to the goals of the individual.”</p>

<p>Keynote speaker Professor Jim Hill from the University of Colorado will discuss balancing the energy equation, and the ins and outs of weight management. Associate Professor Rosanne Kruger will present the hypothesis behind hidden fat and its associated consequences from the Women’s EXPLORE study currently underway, with Master of Science nutrition and dietetics student Richard Swift outlining preliminary data from the study on the effect of physical activity on body composition in women with normal BMI (Body Mass Index).</p>
<p>Senior lecturer in human nutrition Dr Pamela von Hurst says the symposium speakers offer a timely range of topics worth considering as we head into the summer season.</p>
<p>“At this time of year people are looking towards Christmas and the holidays, and considering what changes they will make to their eating and exercise habits. There will be nuggets of information, based on strong research, that people can really use. We’re looking forward to hearing what everyone has to say.”</p>
<p>The Energy Balance Symposium is free to attend, and starts at 3.15 pm on December 4 at the Sir Neil Waters Lecture Theatre, Gate 1, Albany campus.</p>
