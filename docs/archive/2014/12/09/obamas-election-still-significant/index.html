<p>Obama’s Election Still Significant</p>
<p>The election of the first black President of the United States came about because enough of the US population consider themselves one nation.</p>
<p>“Barack Obama’s election did not come about through a pathway of separatism,” New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters told a Māori Ward Public Forum in New Plymouth last night.</p>
<p>“The American civil rights movement did not demand separate institutions, they kept their eye on the prize they wanted. They wanted to bust down the doors and enter the best institutions – the hospitals, the universities and professions.</p>
<p>“Like them, New Zealand First believes in one set of institutions, one law and one set of systems in the 21st century, regardless of our backgrounds,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr Peters said Māori would not get the four fundamental things they wanted – decent housing, healthcare, education and jobs with First World wages – while they were sidelined by the demands of “radicals” and the new Māori middle class with their sugary saccharin of principles and beliefs.</p>
<p>Mr Peters said Māori did not want separatism. This was clear in the fact that the Māori Party only got 1.32 per cent of the vote in the General Election.</p>
<p>On the other hand, after the election New Zealand First had four MPs with Māori in their background, an MP with a Tongan background and one from India.</p>
<p>“We picked them on talent and ability, not race,” he said.</p>
<p>A pathway of separatism would be disastrous for New Zealand and even more disastrous for Māori, Mr Peters said.</p>
