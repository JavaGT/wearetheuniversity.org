<p>The University of Canterbury mechanical engineering car in action last year  </p>
<p>The University of Canterbury mechanical engineering students’ formula car is about 25 percent faster than last year when it was ranked the top rookie team in the competition.</p>
<p>The Canterbury car has been shipped to Melbourne for the international university design, build and Formula SAE race car competition which runs for four days from Thursday.</p>
<p>Team Principal and PhD mechanical engineering student Tim White says they were one of the few teams last year that started and finished in every event.</p>
<p>``Our target this year is to finish in the top three in every event, which is pretty much unheard of for a team in only its second year. The car this year is much faster, lighter and there’s been a huge step-up in the aerodynamics.</p>
<p>``Last year we won the inspired engineering trophy but it will be a lot tougher competition this year with 26 teams from countries such as India, Japan, South Africa, Poland, South Korea and Australia.</p>
<p>``Last year’s car reached 100km in well under four seconds and it had a top speed of 140 kilometres per hour but we have made big improvements right across the board this year and it’s not just about top speed.</p>
<p>``We have to put a business case and pitch our design methods as well as explain costings. We are put through our paces in various other areas including the main endurance race on the last day which requires intensive handling.’’</p>

<p>A team of 23 University of Canterbury students will be at the competition supporting the car in a Team New Zealand yachting style-operation. The team features two women including an aerodynamicist.</p>
<p>White says the governing body of the organisation, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), has extensive safety requirements. Rules of the competition allow and encourage innovation more than any other form of motorsport anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Industries seek out graduates that have been part of Formula SAE teams throughout their degrees. These graduates are considered far more workplace ready than others.</p>
