<p>Canterbury e-learning professor recognised</p>
<p>December 7, 2014</p>
<p>A University of Canterbury professor of e-learning with an outstanding international research reputation has been recognised for her contribution to the New Zealand education system.</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury’s College of Education expert Niki Davis has been promoted to the rank of Distinguished Professor. A major thrust of her research and development is e-learning, including distance education, as her research extends across the globe.</p>
<p>``My research in teacher education and professional development extends beyond e-learning with theoretical models to inform change in education and training, including simultaneous renewal of teacher education and schools.</p>
<p>``Additional projects with leading New Zealand researchers have informed professional and staff development in higher education, including the first set of system-wide scenarios in the world for tertiary education.</p>
<p>``Changes are under way in the education system. Plans are in place for an education communication highway network with $211 million already committed to deliver a funded package of fast, quality connections with uncapped data to schools.</p>
<p>``Teachers can use technology to enhance and facilitate students’ access to the language they are learning and communicative activities that are in line with current understanding of how languages are best learned.</p>
<p>``Many schools in New Zealand have ample technology available in the classrooms and the increased connectivity and uncapped data will be welcome. In research led by Dr Julie Mackey and in collaboration with principals, I am looking at New Zealand school principals and how they can effectively lead e-learning to improve student success.</p>

<p>``Language learners in New Zealand can finally join their counterparts in other countries in having full access to the benefits of streamed video and sound, podcasting, blogging, social media and access to cloud computing and open educational resources.</p>
<p>``Online materials are accessible anywhere, even on mobile devices and some educators are using this to flip their classrooms and free up class time for interaction.</p>
<p>``Some of the young people who people our classes learn to use technology quickly and many are enthusiastic about using digital tools for learning. But their native talent is unschooled and often overestimated.</p>
<p>``Even the most tech-savvy students need teachers who can help them learn the subject at hand. Those who do not have access to technology outside school and those who have special educational needs or who are English language learners will often need even more support.</p>
<p>``Language learning continues to work in the same way regardless of the technology available. The idea that you need to experience input in the target language and have ample opportunity to use the language for real communication still holds, which is expertly modelled for us by my colleague Associate Professor Una Cunningham.</p>
<p>``Computers are great at this and give tireless feedback, but this is not in tune with current thinking on how we learn languages. Let us not lose sight of our goals in our enthusiasm for technology-enhanced learning.’’</p>
