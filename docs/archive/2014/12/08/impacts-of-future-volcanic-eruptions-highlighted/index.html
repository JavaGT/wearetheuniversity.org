<p>Impacts of future eruptions from New Zealand’s caldera volcanoes highlighted by UC expert</p>
<p>December 7, 2014</p>
<p>A future eruption from one of New Zealand’s caldera volcanoes can be expected to cause considerable physical, social and economic damage to New Zealand, an international expert and University Canterbury volcanologist says.</p>
<p>The university’s Dr Tom Wilson told an international volcano conference in Taupo yesterday that while such eruptions have a very low annual probability, the consequences would be considerable.</p>
<p>The Taupo conference was hosted by the University of Canterbury and GNS Science.</p>
<p>Dr Wilson told scientists from all over the world that his team’s research had investigated the impacts from an eruption from one of the eight caldera volcanoes in the Taupo volcanic zone, from coastal Bay of Plenty to Lake Taupo.</p>
<p>``Large areas of the central North Island will be devastated by direct hazards, such as pumice and thick volcanic ash which is a fragmented rock and magma produced by volcanic eruptions. These thick volcanic ash fall and pyroclastic density current deposits will require large-scale evacuation and will result in severe economic impacts in affected regions.</p>
<p>``A crucial consideration is the duration of the disaster. On-going eruptions will cause further damage and disruption to response and recovery. And then the unconsolidated deposits readily remobilise by wind and water which will likely require considerable on-going management for communities.</p>

<p>``For example, rivers will be swamped with volcanic sediment potentially for decades. However, there will also be large areas of the central North Island which will be immediately useable or able to be rehabilitated for viable primary production over short time periods. It is essential we maximise the speed and quality of recovery of these areas to reduce the overall impacts on New Zealand.</p>
<p>``Our research is based on analysis of the impacts from pyroclastic fall and other hazards from recent large eruptions. I presented our impact assessment model of a future Taupo volcanic zone. We outlined the likely damage and disruption to the built environment, critical infrastructure and primary industries such as agriculture and forestry. I also spoke about the recovery and restoration rates to primary industry land-use.’’</p>
<p>The team of University of Canterbury volcanologists has an outstanding record among international research areas. Professor Jim Cole, one of the organisers of the Taupo conference, has won many awards and accolades for his outstanding international volcanic research.</p>
<p>The Canterbury research work is highly relevant as a large portion New Zealand’s national electricity grid is sited only a few kilometres away from active volcanoes - Ruapehu, Tongaririo and Taranaki.</p>
<p>One of the biggest documentary television channels in the world, Discovery, has screened a documentary about a University of Canterbury giant catapult volcanic research project which demonstrated how drag varies as spinning rock and magma fly through the air from a volcano.</p>
<p>More than 500 students studied geological sciences this year, including 140 postgraduate students.</p>
