<p>Visions of a vegetarian New Zealand</p>
<p>A vegetarian New Zealand is seen as contradictory to our national identity but may create a kinder society, according to Victoria University of Wellington research.</p>
<p>Maddie Judge, who will graduate next week with a PhD in Psychology, examined mind-sets surrounding vegetarianism and veganism, including one study that asked participants to imagine a meat-free society in 2050.</p>
<p>A large proportion of those surveyed viewed this future as conflicting with our interests as an agricultural nation and inconsistent with New Zealand’s perceived national identity.</p>
<p>The predicted negative outcomes include economic decline (due to the loss of animal-related industries), environmental degradation (as a result of an increase in animal populations) and a malnourished population (due to the perceived inadequacy of plant-based diets).</p>
<p>Although many viewed plant-based future societies negatively, Maddie was surprised by the large number of positive views that it would reduce dysfunction and increase warmth in society.</p>
<p>“People also referred to more individual changes as a result of widespread plant-based diets—seeing a utopian society where people are peaceful, caring and communal. It’s quite interesting to see these variations.”</p>
<p>The study also focused on the language used to describe vegetarians and vegans in social interaction, and attitudes toward non-meat eaters.</p>
<p>Maddie found that vegans who described their veganism as simply a ‘personal choice’ in online discussions were described in positive terms, but vegans who discussed moral reasons were portrayed as ‘militant’ or ‘extreme’.</p>

<p>The research also found that women tended to be more positive towards vegetarians and vegans than men, and attitudes toward vegetarians tended to be more positive than those toward vegans.</p>
<p>“This might be due to the advocacy—often vegetarianism is framed in dietary terms, whereas veganism is framed more as something to do with values and a concern for nonhuman animals. This may make veganism a little more challenging to the dominant perspective,” says Maddie.</p>
<p>The results of her research led Maddie to explore other ways New Zealand could promote positive messages for vegetarianism and veganism.</p>
<p>“Perhaps plant-based diets could be framed by emphasising the potential positive effects on society, and relating to Kiwis concerns for nature, animals and other humans.”</p>
<p>This study was conducted at Victoria University of Wellington, under the supervision of Dr Marc Wilson and Professor Tony Ward from the School of Psychology.</p>
<p>Maddie will graduate with a Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology on Thursday 11 December.</p>
