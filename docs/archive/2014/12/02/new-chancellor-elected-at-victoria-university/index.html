<p><strong>New Chancellor elected at Victoria University</strong></p>
<p>Neville Jordan, CNZM, was elected Chancellor of Victoria University for 2015 at a meeting of the University Council held yesterday.</p>
<p>Mr Jordan was appointed to the University Council by the Minister of Tertiary Education in June last year. He is a Wellington investor and adviser in science and technology and executive chairman of his company, Endeavour Capital.</p>
<p>Mr Jordan has a background in electronics engineering and is a Distinguished Fellow of the Institution of Professional Engineers of New Zealand. He founded MAS Technology Ltd in 1975, a telecommunications microwave company that he successfully listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. His awards and accolades include the Governor-General’s Supreme Award for Exporting and induction into both the New Zealand Hi Tech Hall of Fame and the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame. Mr Jordan was also President of the Royal Society of New Zealand from 2006–2010 and Wellingtonian of the Year in 2012.</p>
<p>Mr Jordan succeeds Ian McKinnon, CNZM, QSO, JP. Mr McKinnon has had a long and successful tenure on the Victoria University Council including a term as Pro-Chancellor beginning in 2005 followed by a five year term as Chancellor beginning in 2010. Mr McKinnon did not stand for re-election as Chancellor but will remain a Council member until his term expires in 2016.</p>
<p>At the same meeting, Peter Walls, ONZM, was elected Pro-Chancellor for 2015. Dr Walls, a musician and consultant in the arts, was elected by alumni to the University Council in 2013. He was chief executive of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra 2002-2011. Prior to that he was Professor of Music at Victoria (1994—2002) where he had taught since 1976, initially in the Department of English and then (from 1978) in the School of Music. He was made Emeritus Professor in 2006. He was deputy chair of the NZSO board 1996—2002 and a board member of the Health Sponsorship Council 2008—2012.</p>

<p>Dr Walls is deputy chair of Chamber Music New Zealand and a member of the Advisory Board of Victoria University Press and Rattle Records. He is a member of the Music Advisory Committee of the Lilburn Trust. He replaces Graeme Mitchell who has served the University well as Pro-Chancellor for the past two years. Mr Mitchell will also remain a member of Council.</p>
<p>The Chancellor is the Chair of the University Council and responsible for providing leadership to the Council in its development and implementation of its governance responsibilities, including in the area of strategic direction.</p>
<p>The Chancellor is also the ceremonial head of the University presiding over occasions such as graduation. The Chancellor is elected at the Council’s December meeting and holds office for one year but is eligible for re-election. The Pro-Chancellor is the Deputy Chair of the Council.</p>
