<p><strong>Monday, 15 December 2014, 11:54 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/AUT_University">AUT University</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>New Zealanders gambling less, but problem gambling rates unchanged and associated harm substantial</strong></p>
<p>According to the largest New Zealand gambling study in the last 15 years, approximately 23,500 adults are problem gamblers and a further 60,500 adults are at significant risk of developing serious problems.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted by AUT University, and funded by the Ministry of Health as part of the National Gambling Study (NGS). It investigated gambling and gambling-related harm in 6,251 adults.</p>
<p>Lead researcher Professor Max Abbott says, “While there are a substantial number of people with serious gambling disorders, a much larger number experience gambling-related harm, both through their own gambling and through the gambling of others in their families and communities. Collectively, these harms constitute a major public health challenge.”</p>
<p>“Whereas around 84,000 adults are problem or moderate-risk gamblers, approximately 386,000 report gambling-related arguments in their household and 430,000 indicate they are going without something needed or not paying bills because of gambling. Slightly fewer people – 258,500 – said they had been affected by another person’s gambling. Financial impacts were most common, followed by relationship breakups, family stress, loss of trust and frustration, anger and resentment.”</p>
<p>The study found weekly or more frequent participation in casino gambling, use of electronic gaming machines (EGMs) and some other forms of continuous gambling (activities with frequent cycles of play) were strongly associated with gambling problems. Participation in multiple forms of gambling and high expenditure were further risk factors.</p>
<p>According to Professor Abbott, two findings stand out. Firstly, despite substantial reductions over time in frequent gambling involvement, participation in multiple forms and inflation-adjusted official gambling expenditure, problem gambling rates have stayed much the same during the past decade.</p>
<p>Secondly, Maori, Pacific Islanders and some other social groups are much more greatly affected. Pacific Island males are over four times more likely to be problem or moderate-risk gamblers than males in the total population. Maori and Pacific Island females are about twice as likely to be problem or moderate risk gamblers.</p>
<p>Professor Abbott observes that these ethnic differences in problem gambling prevalence are but the tip of the iceberg of gambling-related harms in these groups, and that they have been found in all surveys conducted over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>Other groups at high risk included people living in the most deprived neighbourhoods, males, younger people and those who had low educational qualifications or were unemployed. People of non-Christian religions and other (non-mainstream) Christians were also at high risk.</p>
<p>Professor Abbott comments, “Other research shows that EGMs and TABs are heavily concentrated in the most deprived neighbourhoods. High exposure to more ‘toxic’ gambling forms, combined with socioeconomic inequality and other vulnerabilities, are the major drivers of gambling-related harms.”</p>
<p>He adds that some high risk groups remain under-represented among clients in gambling counselling services, and that more can be done to remedy this. “Gambling harm reduction requires the underlying contributing factors to be addressed.”</p>
<p>Study participants will be reassessed in subsequent years, to examine changes in gambling behaviour over time and identify factors involved in problem onset and recovery.</p>
<p>Approximately $2.0 billion is lost to gambling annually in New Zealand. A significant number of people are harmed by the gambling of others, causing substantial personal distress, social destruction and economic strain.</p>
<p><strong>About the survey</strong><br>The survey investigated gambling participation and gambling-related harm, assessing changes since the previous national gambling surveys were carried out.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted by AUT University and the National Research Bureau in 2012.</p>
<p>It was funded by the Ministry of Health as part of the National Gambling Prevalence and 12 Month Incidence Study (NGS).</p>
<p><strong>Key findings of the survey:</strong><br>• Annual gambling participation rates fell to 80 per cent in 2012, down from 86 per cent in 1999.</p>
<p>• An increased number of people said they had never gambled (14 per cent).</p>
<p>• Fewer people gamble weekly or more: 22 per cent according to the current survey, down from 48 per cent in 1991.</p>
<p>• 6 per cent of people participated in continuous gambling forms weekly or more, down from 18 per cent in 1991.</p>
<p>• Lotto was found to be the most popular form of gambling, with 62 per cent of adults taking part in the past year, followed by raffles (47 per cent), Instant Kiwi (33 per cent), bets with friends and workmates (15 per cent), pub and club EGMs (14 per cent) and betting on horse and dog races (12 per cent). Ten per cent or less took part in other activities.</p>
<p>• A desire to win prizes or money was the most commonly cited reason for taking part in various gambling activities, peaking at 91.6 per cent for Lotto. Entertainment was also frequently mentioned – the leading driver of card game participation at 72.2 per cent; while gambling as an interest / hobby was a key reason for participation in card games (26.1 per cent), horse/dog race betting (22 per cent) and short-term speculative investments (30.1 per cent).</p>
<p>• Reasons given by those who had not gambled in the past 12 months included moral and religious reasons (43.1 per cent), having no interest in gambling (31.3 per cent), the view that gambling is a waste of money or not a priority (29.1 per cent), and poor chances of winning / the perception that gambling was too risky (14.4 per cent). 9.4 per cent refrained because they couldn’t afford it, and 7.9 per cent because gambling is addictive / they have seen people in trouble as a result of gambling.</p>
<p>• It is estimated that 3.6 per cent of all New Zealand adults (including the 20 per cent who did not gamble) indicated loss of control in relation to gambling. 3.1 per cent felt guilty about their gambling, 2.5 per cent chased losses, 1.8 per cent reported being criticised because of their gambling, 1.8 per cent felt they might have a problem with gambling, 1.4 per cent said gambling had a negative effect on their health, 1.3 per cent said they needed to gamble more to get the same level of excitement and 1.1 per cent said gambling had caused financial problems.</p>
<p>• It is estimated that 0.7 per cent of adults are current problem gamblers experiencing significant problems, and a further 1.8 per cent are moderate-risk gamblers, experiencing some gambling-related harms and at risk of developing more serious problems.</p>
<p>• A further 5 per cent are estimated to be low-risk gamblers, mostly experiencing few gambling-related harms. However, they are at somewhat greater risk than the general population of moving into the moderate-risk and problem gambling categories</p>
<p>• 60 per cent of problem gamblers were hazardous drinkers, 71 per cent smoked weekly, 47 per cent reported other recreational drug use, 33 per cent said they were in fair or poor health, and 46 per cent were assessed as having a high or very high probability of experiencing psychological distress.</p>
<p>• 52 per cent of problem gamblers and 28 per cent of moderate-risk gamblers said they wanted help to stop or reduce gambling. These rates are much higher than for adults generally. One in a hundred adults said they had tried to get help to stop or reduce gambling at some time and 42 per cent of these people had tried to do so in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>• A third of adults said they know at least one person that they think currently has, or previously had, a problem with gambling.</p>
