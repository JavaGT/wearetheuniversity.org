<p>New scholarship for Pacific students</p>
<p>Pacific people with leadership potential are being encouraged to apply for a new University of Waikato scholarship funded by the estate of the late Morrinsville accountant and farmer Edna Money.</p>
<p>The Edna Money Future Pacific Leaders’ Scholarship will provide support for students to achieve academically and develop leadership skills through a tailored leadership and personal development programme.</p>
<p>Three scholarships will be offered each year for students undertaking fulltime study. The scholarships are worth $6000 per year for up to three years.</p>
<p>They are being funded from a $1 million bequest from the estate of Edna Money, who died last year aged 94.</p>
<p>She was a Morrinsville farm owner, accountant and philanthropist and is thought to be one of New Zealand’s first female qualified accountants.</p>
<p>The bequest has become part of the University’s Endowment Fund with the interest earned funding the scholarships.</p>
<p>Senior Policy Advisor Pacific, Elena Fa’amoe-Timoteo says the financial support offered by the scholarships will be hugely beneficial to the scholarship recipients but the leadership programme will<br>provide much wider spin offs.</p>
<p>“Having that tailored leadership and personal development programme will help Pacific students develop as leaders and that will benefit entire communities for many years to come,” she says.</p>
<p>Applicants should be New Zealand citizens or permanent residents, of Pacific Island descent and enrolling at the University of Waikato for the first time in 2015.</p>
<p>Scholarship applications are open until 3 November and more information, including how to apply, is available at:</p>
