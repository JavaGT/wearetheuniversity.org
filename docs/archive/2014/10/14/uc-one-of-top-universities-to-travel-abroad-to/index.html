<p>UC one of top universities to travel abroad to</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury (UC) has been named as one of the top universities worth travelling abroad for by website FlipKey.com.</p>
<p>UC tourism researcher Dr Girish Prayag says it not surprising that UC features highly on the “must” visit campuses around the world.</p>
<p>“Besides academic interest, the UC campus provides a physical and social space that stimulates students’ curiosity, creativity and conviviality.</p>
<p>“The use of physical space and landscaping on campus are certainly points of differentiation compared to other campuses in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“At UC the wide open spaces encourage social interactions among students through events or just ‘hanging’ out with friends. The campus is also a tourist attraction for Christchurch. It engages all the five senses as one would expect of tourist experiences. Given the assets of this campus, the UC ‘site’ must be communicated to a wider target market audience to capitalise on the link that exists between education and tourism,” he says.</p>
<p>FlipKey notes that studying abroad is extremely popular and fulfilling, and being able to receive education from a top university can provide academic and personal growth for students.</p>
<p>“International students are not only drawn to the possibility of studying in New Zealand but also the opportunities to travel and experience the place.”</p>
<p>FlipKey also notes that outside of academic interests, the top universities worth travelling to also feature jaw-dropping architecture, flawless grounds and must-see attractions.</p>
<p>“The UC campus is a landmark for Christchurch that must be signposted for both the international student market and visitors.</p>
