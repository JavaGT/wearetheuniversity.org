<p><strong>University of Canterbury students making the most of health and recreation facilities</strong></p>
<p><strong>October 30, 2014</strong></p>
<p>Most University of Canterbury students are making the most of opportunities to connect with campus life, through involvement in clubs and the use of health and recreation facilities, according to a major survey of students’ health and well-being.</p>
<p>All students were surveyed on behalf of the University of Canterbury Students’ Association (UCSA) and more than 2950 students responded, giving information about their health and well-being, an important consideration for enhancing students’ experience.</p>
<p>A total of 62 percent or 1759 students made use of the campus Health Centre. Of these, more than 90 percent reported they were satisfied with the care they received.</p>
<p>About 13 percent of those who responded took advantage of the university’s special dental care offer. A high proportion of students, 85 percent, were satisfied with the dental care they received. The UCSA provides a subsidised dental care programme - just $25 for a complete dental check-up.</p>
<p>About 13 percent of those students who responded to the survey indicated that they make use of counselling services. Around three quarters of these were satisfied with the care they received.</p>
<p>Most of the student respondents said they use the Rec Centre, about two or three times a week. A large proportion (77 percent) thought the equipment was of a good standard.</p>
<p>Over half (56 percent) of responding students indicated that they belong to at least one of the 140 clubs on campus, demonstrating that clubs are important part of student life and engagement.</p>

<p>UC Students’ Association president Sarah Platt says the results of the survey show just how much students enjoy their time at the university in a unique environment since the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes.</p>
<p>``We’re excited already about 2015 which will definitely be the best yet for students since the earthquakes. The campus is well into the rebuild and positive improvements can be seen every day.</p>
<p>``The UCSA is all about students. We do everything we can to make their time at UC the very best it can be and that doesn&#39;t stop with just social events. We also provide academic advocacy and advice, and financial assistance.</p>
<p>``The student experience we have at UC sets us apart from other universities around New Zealand and our clubs on campus are a big part of that,’’ Platt says.</p>
