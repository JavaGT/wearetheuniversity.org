<p><strong>Wellington’s most iconic Mo mowed for Movember</strong></p>
<p>Wellington’s favourite mustache is gone!</p>
<p>Lorenzo Bresolin, The Great Food Race Judge and bearer of one of New Zealand’s most spectacular Mo’s has shaved it off all in the name of Movember and men’s health. (See the video of Lorenzo’s shave-down here: <a href="http://nz.movember.com/news/view/?id=7657">http://nz.movember.com/news/view/?id=7657</a>)</p>
<p>Movember begins next month as Mo Bros take action by changing their appearance through the growth of a new moustache for the 30 days of Movember, and in doing so become walking, talking billboards for men’s health.</p>
<p>Bresolin’s main motivation to get involved was losing his father to cancer and a lot of encouragement from a friend.</p>
<p>“I’ve been affected by the loss of my father, so it’s great to be able to help out,” says Bresolin.</p>
<p>“The removal of such a well-endowed moustache is a pretty good way to kick start the campaign, and I was happy to donate it to the cause,” he said.</p>
<p>Bresolin knows his way around Wellington, with famous restaurants Duke Carvells, Scopa and the impending opening of The Bresolin, and he believes that Wellington is without a doubt the facial hair capital of the world.</p>
<p>“I’ve just been through Germany, Italy and other European cities and seen that the beard and the Mo are very prolific everywhere at the moment, but Wellington has a particular local style.<br>“We’ll have our work cut out to convince all those hirsute Wellingtonians to shave off all that hair and re-grow it for Movember,” said Bresolin.</p>

<p>Supporting this theory is Brendan ‘Bundy the Barber’ Blake who owns and runs local barbershop Boar N Blade. Bundy and convinced Bresolin to get involved.</p>
<p>“I would have to say Wellington is definitely the front runner and home to some of the best beards and moustaches in New Zealand,” says Blake.</p>
<p>It’s right up there with the rest of the world,” he laughs.</p>
<p>Blake’s involvement in Movember is also a personal one having being diagnosed with testicular cancer in May this year.</p>
<p>“I was really lucky I caught it early I had it removed and so far I am all clear,” says Blake.</p>
<p>“So this cause is really close to home and it&#39;s a great opportunity to do my bit for an amazing charity and movement.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see the ‘she&#39;ll be right’ attitude less and less these day&#39;s. I think the modern day male isn&#39;t as stupid to be frank. They’re becoming more pro-active and thats the way it should be - it&#39;s awesome.”</p>
<p>Wellingtonians aren’t to worry though as Bresolin guarantees his Mo will definitely be coming back bigger and better.</p>
<p>“It’s my trademark! I can’t imagine life without it,” he said.</p>
<p>Movember New Zealand Country Manager Robert Dunne says it’s such a great opportunity for Movember to have Lorenzo onboard.</p>
<p>“With Lorenzo signed up we’re hoping his fundraising efforts will influence all Wellington’s moustache growers to go shave off their beloved Mo’s and take up the challenge.”</p>
