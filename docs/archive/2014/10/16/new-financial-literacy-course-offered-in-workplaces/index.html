<p><strong>New financial literacy course offered in workplaces</strong></p>
<p>To celebrate Money Week 2014, a new online version of the Fin-Ed Centre’s Money Smarts course, called Money Smarts @Work, is being offered in workplaces for the first time.</p>
<p>Frenzi Group, one of New Zealand’s leading hospitality companies, is offering the financial literacy programme to staff members to help them better manage their finances.</p>
<p>Fin-Ed Centre director Dr Pushpa Wood says the new, cost-effective course is in keeping with the centre’s tradition of identifying financial literacy needs in the community.</p>
<p>“Money Smarts @ Work is a short online course that fills a need – people are time poor, but learning some basic financial skills can really make a long-term difference to people’s lives. Our aim is to provide convenient choices to people who want to improve their money management skills and are self-motivated to take action.”</p>
<p>The course is fully online so participants can complete it in their own time. It is designed to provide a basic understanding of some of the principles, tools and techniques necessary for personal financial management. The content includes goal setting, budgeting, saving, debt management and protecting assets.</p>
<p>The course only costs participants $49, but Frenzi Group is heavily subsiding the costs for their staff.</p>
<p>&quot;Frenzi Group believes that smart financial management is just as important in our personal lives as it is in business, so we’ve worked with Massey University’s Fin-Ed Centre to make this short, flexible online course available to staff so they can gain additional skills in managing their finances,&quot; says Frenzi director Roy Thompson.</p>
<p>Dr Wood says the course was trialled with a number of employees to ensure the content was relevant and engaging and ready to be launched in Money Week.</p>
<p>“We are really delighted that Frenzi Group, has decided to offer the course to their staff. We look forward to getting feedback from the participants and hope to see the programme roll out in other workplaces around the country.”</p>
