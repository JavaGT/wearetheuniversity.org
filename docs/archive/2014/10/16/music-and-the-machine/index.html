<p>Musical machines and robots will take over Victoria University of Wellington’s Hub this Friday.</p>
<p>Following the success of last year’s event, the Sonic Arts and Engineering Showcase brings together 20 collaborative installations designed by students from Te Kōkī New Zealand School of Music (NZSM) Sonic Arts programme and Victoria’s Faculty of Engineering Electronics courses.</p>
<p>A number of these projects feature the ability to respond mechanically and sonically to changes in their immediate environment.</p>
<p>A particular highlight of the showcase will be ‘Striker&#39;, a three-armed mechanical drum-playing instrument, that is able to predict where and how loud to play the drums in response to incoming musical events.</p>
<p>There has recently been an increasing overlap and growing potential for collaboration between NZSM and Electronics courses at Victoria, with a particular focus on interactivity and new ways of involving the audience.</p>
<p>The showcase will demonstrate the advanced skills of Victoria’s Sonic Arts and Engineering students and highlights the innovative projects that have exercised both the creative and technological parts of their brains, says NZSM Senior Lecturer Michael Norris.</p>
<p>“These skills will stand Victoria’s students in good stead in the cutting-edge technology careers of tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Sonic Arts and Engineering Showcase 2014</strong></p>
<p>When: Friday 17 October, 12–4.30pm</p>
<p>Where: Level 2, The Hub, Victoria University, Gate 3, Kelburn Parade, Kelburn, Wellington</p>
