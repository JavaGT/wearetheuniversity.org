<p><strong>Speaker on rise of the health bots</strong></p>
<p>An expert on surgical robotics and innovation will be visiting from the United States this month.</p>
<p>Ex-patriot Kiwi, Dr Catherine Mohr is a University of Auckland Hood Fellow, and will be giving several lectures on campus.</p>
<p>Surgery has changed rapidly in the last 10 years with the advent of surgical robots and the increase in minimally invasive surgical techniques.</p>
<p>Dr Mohr will talk about these changes in surgical practice, the technologies that underlie them, and what we might see in the future as new technologies such as earlier diagnostics, advanced imaging and regenerative medicine bring disruptive changes to healthcare around the world.</p>
<p>This year’s ‘World Class New Zealand Award’ winner, Dr Mohr is Vice President of Medical Research at Intuitive Surgical, where she evaluates new technologies for incorporation into the next generation of surgical robots.</p>
<p>She is also a consulting Assistant Professor in the department of Surgery at Stanford School of Medicine and on the Medicine and Robotics Faculty at Singularity University.</p>
<p>She has published numerous scientific papers, is the recipient of multiple awards and a frequent speaker at national and international conferences.</p>
<p>In an academic seminar at the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, Dr Mohr will talk on ‘When Healthcare becomes Invisible’, and will discuss the history of society’s views of health care, looking ahead 25 years to see where we might be going with the advent of regenerative medicine, genomics and direct gene manipulation.</p>
