<p><em>The 12th Annual Frank Sargeson Memorial Lecture</em></p>
<p><strong>Knowing Your Place - Catherine Chidgey</strong></p>
<p>Novelist and short story writer, Catherine Chidgey, will address the idea of place in her writing at this lecture. She will consider the ways in which the real world impinges on the imaginary, and explore some of the tricks a writer can use to make an imaginary place seem real.</p>
<p>Catherine’s novels have been published to international acclaim. They have been selected as books of the year by <em>Time Out</em> magazine (London), the <em>New York Times Review of Books</em> and the <em>Los Angeles Times.</em> The <em>Herald</em> notes that “Chidgey could tackle any subject and produce something wonderful”. Her awards include the BNZ Katherine Mansfield Award, the International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML) Prize, and Best First Book in both the Commonwealth Writers’ Prize (Asia-Pacific region) and the New Zealand Book Awards. In 2003 the <em>Listener</em> voted her best New Zealand novelist under forty. Catherine is a literary adviser to the Sargeson Trust and teaches creative writing at the University of Waikato. She is currently completing her fourth novel.</p>
