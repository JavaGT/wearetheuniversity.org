<p>UC and CPIT launch new degree programme</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury (UC) will launch its new Master of Health Sciences and Bachelor of Nursing joint initiative with Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (CPIT) today (13 October).</p>
<p>The new programme gives the opportunity for students who already hold a degree to gain two further qualifications in just two and a half years.</p>
<p>Head of the School of Health Sciences, Professor Philip Schluter, says that the collaboration with CPIT on the programme is a new and exciting step for the School.</p>
<p>“The partnership with CPIT will provide an entry pathway into nursing and will, for the first time in New Zealand, graduate nurses who have undertaken masters level study,” he says.</p>
<p>Students will be fulltime UC Master of Health Sciences (MHealSc) and part-time Bachelor of Nursing (BN) students for the first two years, after which they will be fulltime CPIT students for the remaining part of the programme. A part-time MHealSc option is also being developed.</p>
<p>“The masters qualification will equip students with the advanced academic skills and knowledge should they wish to progress towards a doctoral degree. It will also help build the research base within the nursing profession,” he says.</p>
<p>Having completed the MHealSc/BN programmes, graduates will be eligible to gain employment as nurses in New Zealand. The MHealSc will give graduates a thorough academic knowledge which may be beneficial to employment and career progression.</p>
