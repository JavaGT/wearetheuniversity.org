<p><strong>Young UC researchers’ work recognised</strong></p>
<p>Two University of Canterbury (UC) academics have been named the inaugural recipients of the University of Canterbury’s Early and Emerging Career Researcher Award.</p>
<p>Dr Brendon Bradley (Civil and Natural Resources Engineering) and Dr Daniel Stouffer (Biological Sciences) received the award for their outstanding contribution to research at UC so early in their careers.</p>
<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) Professor Steve Weaver says that Dr Bradley and Dr Stouffer showed exceptional talent in their respective fields, producing ground-breaking research that has real world applications.</p>
<p>“Brendon and Daniel are both inspiring future research leaders and this award recognises their contributions to their respective fields both nationally and internationally,” says Professor Weaver.</p>
<p>Dr Bradley is an earthquake engineer whose research speciality is the prediction of earthquake-induced ground motions and seismically-induced losses to infrastructure, while Dr Stouffer is a theoretical ecologist whose primary research focus is the study of complex species-species interaction networks.</p>
<p>Both Dr Bradley and Dr Stouffer were recently awarded prestigious 2013 Rutherford Discovery Fellowships, each receiving $800,000 over five years to help them further their research.</p>
<p>“It feels fantastic to be recognised as one of the emerging career researchers at UC and I am very much looking forward to what is to come in the following years with my research,” says Dr Stouffer.</p>
<p>Dr Bradley has helped produce more than 60 high impact journal articles and 101 conference papers in his four years at UC. Dr Stouffer has 25 peer-reviewed articles and one book chapter since 2005.</p>
<p>“Both researchers are highly regarded both within New Zealand and internationally. They both have very bright careers ahead of them,” says Professor Weaver.</p>
