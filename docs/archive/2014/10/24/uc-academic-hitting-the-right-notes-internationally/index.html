<p><strong>UC academic hitting the right notes internationally</strong></p>
<p>A University of Canterbury (UC) composer and music teacher has hit the right notes by being elected to the Executive Committee of the International Society of Contemporary Music (ISCM).</p>
<p>Head of the School of Music, Associate Professor Glenda Keam, is the first New Zealander to be appointed to the Executive Committee ISCM and is the only non-European member of the committee.</p>
<p>The 92-year-old organisation supports the development of music internationally, and encourages networking of composer organisations and sharing of music between cultures and nations.</p>
<p>Professor Keam says she is very pleased and honoured by her appointment.</p>
<p>“It feels important to continue to represent this part of the world, and bring a greater understanding of New Zealand culture and its situation to ISCM as an organisation and to the individuals that constitute the ISCM.”</p>
<p>During her two-year term, Professor Keam hopes to represent the voice of Aotearoa and the Pacific region.</p>
<p>“The organisation has its roots in continental Europe and, as such, it is musically and historically rich, but there are often situations where a perspective from the other side of the globe is useful. We do things differently here, and it’s good to offer that perspective,” she says.</p>
<p>“The increased opportunities to build connections and gain greater understanding of what is happening musically in other countries means that I can help instigate and support creative links with other universities and creative organisations.”</p>
<p>Professor Keam is spearheading plans to bring the ISCM World New Music Days in 2020 to Auckland and Christchurch.</p>
<p>“I am very excited about this possibility - our city will be significantly transformed and it has a remarkable story to tell.”</p>
<p>Professor Keam has also been President of the Composers Association of NZ (CANZ) for the past seven years, CANZ is the national member of ISCM.</p>
