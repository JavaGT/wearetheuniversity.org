<p>Tim Barnett, Labour General Secretary and Returning Officer for the process, said today:</p>
<p>“Our leadership election process is a wonderful expression of party democracy, involving all Party members, all 7 affiliates and all 32 Labour Members of Parliament. It is a rigorous test of leadership qualities. Its’ outcome will be crucial to our Party’s single-minded determination to learn from our election result and regroup for victory in 2017”.</p>

<p><strong>BRIEFING NOTE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Examples of other political parties using Electoral Colleges to elect their Leader</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand Labour’s electoral college, which has extended the power to choose a leader to party members and affiliated bodies as well as to MPs, was modelled fairly closely on the procedures of the British Labour Party, and the Australian Labor Party has since adopted a similar model.</p>
<p><strong>UK Labour Party</strong></p>
<p>• Each nomination for leader must be supported by 12.5 per cent of the Labour MPs in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>• There are three <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/electorate">groups</a> of voters:</p>
<p>1. Labour members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom">House of Commons</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament">European Parliament</a></p>
<p>2. Individual members of the party</p>
<p>3. Individual members of affiliated organisations, such as trade unions and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_society_(Labour_Party)">socialist societies</a>.</p>
<p>• Each of the groups or sections contributes one third (33.33 per cent) of the total votes and were counted using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">Alternative Vote</a> system.</p>
<p>Over the next 5 years, this system will be reformed so that all eligible voters will be members, affiliated supporters and registered supporters.[1]</p>
<p><strong>UK Conservatives</strong></p>
<p>They have a two stage process. A leadership contest can be initiated either by the incumbent leader resigning or by the Parliamentary Party passing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_of_no_confidence">vote of no confidence</a> in the present leader. Either way a leadership election is called and the incumbent is barred from standing in it.</p>
<p>If two candidates stand, then the election immediately proceeds to a ballot of all members of the party. If more than two candidates stand, then MPs first hold a series of ballots to reduce the number to two.</p>
<p><strong>Australian Labor Party</strong></p>
<p>Eligible members and Federal Parliamentary Caucus members all have a vote, with each grouping constituting 50% of the voting strength of the College,</p>
<p><strong>Canadian Conservative Party</strong></p>
<p>The leader is selected by a system in which each of the party&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riding_association">riding/electorate associations</a> was allocated 100 points, which were allocated among candidates in proportion to the votes that he or she received.</p>
<p><strong>Canadian Liberal Party</strong></p>
<p>Since 2009 leadership elections have been conducted according to a weighted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Member_One_Vote">One Member One Vote</a> system in which all party members and registered sympathisers/supporters cast ballots but in which they would be counted so that each <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_(Canada)">riding</a>/electorate had equal weight.</p>
