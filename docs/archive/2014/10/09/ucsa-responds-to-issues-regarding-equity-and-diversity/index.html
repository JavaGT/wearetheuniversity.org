<p><strong>Thursday, 9 October 2014, 4:11 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury_Students_Association">University of Canterbury Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>UCSA responds to issues regarding Equity and Diversity on campus</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury Students’ Association is committed to ensuring all students and staff feel they belong while living, learning and teaching in their university community. We want all UC students to thrive and excel in their studies and it is our responsibility to ensure all students feel they belong in our community. We acknowledge that in light of the recent ENSOC Roundie 500 a number of students and staff were upset. As a result, an environment of belonging on campus was not promoted and the UCSA acknowledges that.</p>
<p>The UCSA President, Sarah Platt and the Executive take its responsibility to advocate for all students seriously. “The Executive has had extensive discussions around campus culture and acknowledge that we can do better.”</p>
<p>We have engaged with ENSOC, FEMSOC, concerned students and the University of Canterbury around the identified issues. Through a thorough process of consultation, the UCSA believe the following planned actions championed by the 2014/15 Executives will help strengthen our commitment to representing all student diversity, including culture, religion, gender, ability, age and sexual orientation, and to supporting equality in theory and in practice.</p>
<p>1. Establish a UCSA Student Equity and Diversity Advisory Committee (SEDAC) that will be chaired by the UCSA Executive representative on UC Central Equity and Diversity Advisory Committee (CEDAC).</p>
<p>2. Continue our education program with our 130 affiliated clubs, including the use of social media, conflict resolution and cultural competency.</p>

<p>3. Review our club affiliation policy and the UCSA constitution to ensure that it is in line with best practice around diversity, inclusivity and tolerance.</p>
<p>4. Organise an international student forum in conjunction with UC (planned for early next week).</p>
<p>5. Continue to play a key role in the organisation of Diversity Week in 2015.</p>
<p>Working towards an inclusive and tolerant campus is an ongoing process that the UCSA is committed to. We encourage students and the wider community to engage and help us ensure students feel respected, free to voice their opinions and know they can do so without harassment or marginalisation.</p>
<p>“We believe the University of Canterbury is an amazing place to live, learn and grow and students, clubs, staff and the wider community play an important role in enhancing the student experience. We are committed to the role we can play in ensuring University of Canterbury students and graduates are prepared to make a positive difference in the world.”</p>
