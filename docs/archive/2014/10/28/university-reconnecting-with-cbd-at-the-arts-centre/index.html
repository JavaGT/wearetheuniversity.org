<p><strong>The University of Canterbury reconnecting with CBD at the Arts Centre</strong></p>
<p><strong>28 October 2014</strong></p>
<p>The University of Canterbury will build on and strengthen its connections with the central city, leasing the Chemistry Building in the Arts Centre for at least the next eight years.</p>
<p>The building will provide student learning in classics and music, including increased opportunities for music performances. The University’s valuable James Logie memorial art collection of more than 350 Greek and Roman artefacts will also be held and displayed in the building, increasing opportunities for public access.</p>
<p>The move demonstrates the university’s commitment to the central Christchurch rebuild and it emphasises the historic link between University and central Christchurch, Vice-Chancellor Rod Carr says.</p>
<p>“This shows our determination to be part of the central city’s rebuild, and reminds us of our historical connections with it. Locating classics and music at the Arts Centre enables the university to engage more effectively with the city’s local and international arts scene.</p>
<p>“More performance opportunities will be enabled for music students on and off site and our students will pump added energy through the cultural heart of Christchurch,” Dr Carr says.</p>
<p>“This demonstrates, in a very tangible way, the University’s recognition of the value of a strong College of Arts both on and off campus, and across the city. This is a way UC can reconnect with the city, and the city with us, as well as adding value to the arts sector in Christchurch and support the city’s cultural renewal in the heart of the city.</p>

<p>“In particular, the classics and music departments will have an ideal environment for greater collaboration with the Arts Centre, the Canterbury Museum, and the Art Gallery, and other key parts of the Christchurch cultural and educational community,” Dr Carr says.</p>
<p>The space freed up on the Ilam campus will also then be available for short term decanting and storage for other departments.</p>
<p>The Chemistry Building in the Arts Centre is due to be handed over in April next year for a fit out, which will take up to five months.</p>
