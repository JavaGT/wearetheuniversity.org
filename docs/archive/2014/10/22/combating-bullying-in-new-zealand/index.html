<p>Combating bullying in New Zealand  </p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington’s Accent Learning is rolling out a new bullying prevention programme for schools—a first for the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The programme originated in Finland and is called KiVa, which means ‘kiusaamista vastaan’ or ‘against bullying’.</p>
<p>It has proven successful in many schools across Northern Europe where they have seen both a reduction in bullying and an increase in learning achievements. In New Zealand it will initially be will be offered to primary schools.<br>Designed for year two to ten students, KiVa is based on current evidence around what works in preventing bullying, and offers a continuing education programme to school principals and teachers.</p>
<p>The programme focuses on three distinct groups: the bully, the victim and bystanders. It also involves a commitment from the wider school community.</p>
<p>“The beauty of this programme is that it focuses heavily on prevention,” says Deidre Vercauteren, Education Manager at Accent Learning.</p>
<p>“It’s not just a reaction to problems—it works in the background to reduce the number of bullying incidents.”</p>
<p>Accent Learning provides support and professional development to primary and secondary teachers in the lower North Island.</p>
<p>Professor Christina Salmivalli and Dr Virpi Pöyhönen from Finland’s University of Turku, were commissioned by the Finnish Ministry of Education to develop KiVa, spent a week with Accent Learning staff training them to implement the programme in New Zealand classrooms.</p>
<p>Victoria’s School of Education will complement the introduction of KiVa into New Zealand schools by conducting evaluation studies to measure its effectiveness.</p>
<p>The School’s research has already revealed that 94 percent of New Zealand teachers and principals recognise that bullying is a serious problem and that we need to do something about it, says Professor Vanessa Green from Victoria’s School of Education.</p>
<p>“It has also shown that most teachers have not been trained in how to deal with bullying.”</p>
<p>“The KiVa programme provides schools with a systematic method for dealing with bullying issues as they arise and, most importantly, a step-by-step process to follow in order to prevent bullying.”</p>
