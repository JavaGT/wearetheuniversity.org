<p><strong>Wednesday, 22 October 2014, 4:38 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Driving Down Wages through Record Migration</p>
<p>The National government is using uncontrolled migration as a crude device to drive down wages and lower living standards, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“Minister of Immigration Michael Woodhouse quibbled over terminology, and refused to adequately answer questions on numbers in Parliament today,” says New Zealand First Member of Parliament Ron Mark. “It was a poor show and reinforces our belief that National is content with a record level of migration.</p>
<p>“How is Auckland supposed to plan given a significant number of the people who come to New Zealand will settle in our biggest city?</p>
<p>“With net migration at the highest ever figure of 45,400, the government should be building thousands of houses a year just for new New Zealanders, but in fact, they have only built five houses for everyone.</p>
<p>“An urgent debate is needed on how many people New Zealand needs – we must ensure there are benefits for our country and not adverse effects. We must have a plan.</p>
<p>“Just last month the British Labour Party admitted that open-door immigration in the UK had undercut workers’ wages and lowered living standards.</p>
<p>“The party also admitted it had covered up a string of damaging reports about the impact of mass immigration,” says Mr Mark.</p>
<p>“Uncontrolled migration is forcing Kiwis into queues for hospital beds, housing and jobs. It’s unfair on New Zealanders.”</p>
