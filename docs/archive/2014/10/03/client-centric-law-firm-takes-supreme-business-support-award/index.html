<p><strong>Client-centric law firm takes 2014 Supreme Business Support Award</strong></p>
<p>A radical shift designed to put clients at the centre of its business has earned law firm Minter Ellison Rudd Watts the Supreme Award at the 2014 AUT University Business School Excellence in Business Support Awards. Winners were announced at a gala dinner held at the Langham Hotel, Auckland last night</p>
<p>In response to the global financial crisis, Minter Ellison made big changes aimed at growth, finding ways to better serve its client base and identifying new business opportunities.</p>
<p>“Minter Ellison Rudd Watts has a clear long-term vision that defines its strategy well. The entire business revolves around a philosophy to “Listen, Care, Deliver”, which is essential to excellence in business support. Although an established firm in New Zealand, in recent years it has embarked on growth and change strategies and the results clearly reflect a dynamic, successful firm,” says awards evaluator AUT Accounting Lecturer Gillian Craig.</p>
<p>Minter Ellison also won the ‘Auckland Centre for Financial Research Business $20M-$100M T/O’ category award. Winners of all the category awards are listed below.</p>
<p>“Business cares about business support, because excellent support behind the scenes from firms like Minter Ellison makes for successful business outcomes at the front end,” says AUT University Dean of Business and Law, Professor Geoff Perry. “This year the standard of entries across the 11 categories was impressive, which confirms that the business support sector continues to make a significant and valuable contribution.”</p>
