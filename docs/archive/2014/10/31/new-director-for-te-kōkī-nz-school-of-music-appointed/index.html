<p><strong>New Director for Te Kōkī New Zealand School of Music appointed</strong></p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Deborah Willis has announced the appointment of Euan Murdoch as the new Director of Te Kōkī New Zealand School of Music (NZSM).</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have someone of Euan’s experience to take on the role of Director of Te Kōkī New Zealand School of Music. One of the key strengths of the School is its strong and successful links with the local music community. I’m confident that this will continue to flourish under Euan’s leadership.”</p>
<p>Mr Murdoch is currently Chief Executive of Chamber Music New Zealand, a position he has held since 2006. Chamber Music New Zealand (CMNZ) is the country’s premier chamber music organisation and presents over 250 events each year nationwide, including the national Chamber Music Contest for young musicians. Under his leadership, CMNZ has been revitalised and transformed to become one of New Zealand’s foremost arts leadership organisations. Prior to that he was Interim Director at the NZSM for a year and previously Head of School of Music at Victoria.</p>
<p>In 2013, Mr Murdoch was awarded a Winston Churchill Memorial Fellowship. He was also invited to be a judge for both the Asia Pacific Chamber Music Competition in Melbourne and the St Martin in the Fields Chamber Music Competition in London. His opinions, ideas and expertise as an Arts leader are sought after both within New Zealand and internationally.</p>

<p>Mr Murdoch says NZSM must continue to establish an international profile through high-quality inter-disciplinary research, teaching and learning programmes. “Te Kōkī New Zealand School of Music must also champion and advocate for the essential place of music in our daily lives.”</p>
<p>The activities of the NZSM were transferred from Massey University to Victoria University in July this year.</p>
<p>The NZSM was ranked first in New Zealand for music research in the most recent national assessment of tertiary institutions. Its staff are professionally active musicians, as jazz and New Zealand Symphony Orchestra performers. Artists in residence include the New Zealand String Quartet.</p>
<p>Mr Murdoch will begin his appointment on 26 January 2015.</p>
