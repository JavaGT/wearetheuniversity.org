<p><strong>NZ Diversity Survey - benchmarking workplace diversity</strong></p>
<p>AUT University’s New Zealand Work Research Institute (NZWRI) has released a report on diversity in New Zealand workplaces.</p>
<p>The report, based on data collected from business owners and employers between November 2013 and August 2014, is available at: http://<a href="http://www.workresearch.aut.ac.nz/nzdiversitysurvey">www.workresearch.aut.ac.nz/nzdiversitysurvey</a></p>
<p>Professor Tim Bentley, Director of the NZWRI, led the research in collaboration with the EEO Trust and the Chamber of Commerce, Northern.</p>
<p><strong>Key findings</strong></p>
<p><strong>Important diversity issues</strong><br>The diversity issues most commonly perceived as important to organisations were: wellbeing, ageing workforce and flexibility. For many of those issues, organisations had a policy or programme/initiative in place, particularly for bullying and harassment (more than 80% of organisations). But less than 40% of organisations had a policy or programme relating to the ageing workforce.</p>
<p><strong>Most common diversity practice</strong><br>Flexible work arrangements including teleworking were the most common diversity practice, with approximately 60% of respondents’ organisations having staff members that telework at least one day a week.</p>
<p><strong>Female representation</strong><br>On average females held just under half of leadership and governance roles, but in both cases the proportion of female representation decreased with increased organisation size.</p>

<p><strong>Disability and accessibility</strong><br>Nearly 75% of respondents reported that their organisations were accessible for people who live with disabilities, a figure that improved as organisation size increased.</p>
<p><strong>Ethnic minority representation</strong><br>Less than 40% of respondents’ organisations had ethnic minority representation within their leadership or decision-making teams, with representation more likely in larger organisations.</p>
