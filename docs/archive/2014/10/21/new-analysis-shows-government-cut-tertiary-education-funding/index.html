<p><strong>New Analysis Shows Government Cut Tertiary Education Funding</strong></p>
<p>New analysis done by the Green Party today shows the Government has made cuts to funding of tertiary education since 2008.</p>
<p>Figures compiled by the Parliamentary Library show that between 2009 and 2015 Government funding to Tertiary Institutions dropped by 4 percent, adjusting for inflation and increases in funded places.</p>
<p>“The Government is forcing students to pay higher fees because they are not adequately funding tertiary institutions,” Green Party tertiary education spokesperson Gareth Hughes said today.</p>
<p>“We should be increasing the affordability of tertiary education, not putting it further out of reach of many students.</p>
<p>“On top of their cuts to Postgraduate Student Allowances this Government is cutting overall funding and making it harder for New Zealanders to study at a tertiary level by ramping up fees even higher.</p>
<p>“High fees are a barrier to participation and lead to years of debt for many students.</p>
<p>“Tertiary Education is both a public good and a way to address New Zealand’s low labour force productivity.</p>
<p>“High fees load too much of the cost on students who can’t afford them.</p>
<p>“The Government shouldn’t be shifting more of the cost of Tertiary Education onto students in an attempt to get into surplus,” said Mr Hughes.</p>
