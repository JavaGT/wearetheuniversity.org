<p><strong>Former Waikato Uni student receives top rugby award</strong></p>
<p>University of Waikato alumnus and Waikato Rugby Union player Whetu Douglas received high recognition recently for his outstanding role in rugby.</p>
<p>The former Gisborne Boys’ High School student was awarded the Aaron Hopa Memorial Trophy at the Waikato Rugby Awards last Thursday for his outstanding contribution to team culture within the Waikato ITM Cup team.</p>
<p>Whetu says it was a privilege to receive the award.</p>
<p>“It was an honour to receive the trophy, especially when you take a look at some of the names that have received the award previously. Now it is a matter of living up to the expectations of those names and the trophy in the years to come.”</p>
<p>Whetu was a Hillary scholar at University, which is an all fees paying scholarship designed to foster leadership potential in students while they study and pursue their discipline in sport or the arts.</p>
<p>While at University, Whetu was part of Te Tohu Paetahi, a total Māori immersion programme before undertaking a conjoint degree in arts and sport and leisure.</p>
<p>Whetu hopes to again secure the number 6 jersey in the Waikato ITM team, and hopefully progress to Super 15 honours in the coming seasons.</p>
