<p><strong>New Writer in Residence for Victoria University</strong></p>
<p>The Victoria University of Wellington/Creative New Zealand Writer in Residence for 2015 is novelist and essayist Dr Tim Corballis.</p>
<p>Tim receives $50,000 and a writing room at Victoria’s International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML).</p>
<p>The award represents something of a welcome back to Victoria for Tim, who won the Adam Foundation Prize in 2000 for his Master of Arts thesis which became his first novel, <em>Below</em>. He has subsequently published two other novels—<em>Measurement</em> and <em>The Fossil Pits</em>.</p>
<p>Tim also held the Randall Cottage Writers’ Residency in 2003 and the Creative New Zealand Berlin Writers’ Residency in 2005 to 2006.</p>
<p>He recently completed a PhD at The University of Auckland on aesthetic theory in the context of the Antipodes and he sees this theoretical work as closely informing all of his creative practice.</p>
<p>Next year, Victoria University Press will publish Tim’s latest book, a pair of novellas.</p>
<p>Professor Damien Wilkins, the Director of the IIML, says he is excited about the appointment.</p>
<p>“Tim is an ambitious, adventurous writer with a powerful intellect and a restless imagination. It will be fascinating to see how his forays into essays and other critical thought impact on his fiction.”</p>
<p>During his time as Writer in Residence, Tim will be focusing mainly on a new novel, a piece of speculative fiction using time-travel to explore contemporary issues.</p>
<p>Tim says that the money, resources and time to write as part of the residency will be a rare luxury.</p>

<p>“Perhaps more important—and even rarer—is the fact of being plucked for a year from the writer’s usual isolation, and being given colleagues and a place within the intellectual life of the University.”</p>
<p>Tim lives in Wellington with his partner, Ingrid Horrocks, who is also a writer, and their twin daughters.</p>
<p>Previous recipients of the Victoria University of Wellington/Creative New Zealand Writer in Residence include Elizabeth Knox, Maurice Gee, Jack Lasenby, Jenny Bornholdt and Patricia Grace.</p>
