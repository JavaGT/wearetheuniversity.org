<p>Peeni Henare<br>Māori Caucus Chairperson</p>
<p>29 October 2014</p>
<p><strong>The Māori Party can’t have it both ways over labour laws</strong></p>
<p>The Māori Party has to fess up over its voting record on the Employment Relations Amendment Bill, says Labour’s Māori Caucus.</p>
<p>“It’s simply not good enough to oppose the bill at the same time as they helped speed up its progress through Parliament, Māori Caucus chairperson Peeni Henare says.</p>
<p>“The Māori Party is caught by its own confidence and supply agreement with National which means it has to vote on procedural motions ensuring the bill becomes law.</p>
<p>“Last night it voted twice to stop the debate of this iniquitous piece of law making at the committee stages.</p>
<p>“This is a bill which affects thousands of Māori workers. It takes away their rights and breaks down the provisions of work place bargaining.</p>
<p>“For decades Māori have played a key role in our union movement. They must have the protection that the National Party with the help of the Māori Party is now trying to remove, “says Peeni Henare.</p>
