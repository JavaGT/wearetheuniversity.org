<p><strong>Thursday, 15 May 2014, 12:54 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato">University of Waikato</a></strong></p>
<p>Research Institute Scholarships on offer at Waikato University</p>
<p>The University of Waikato is offering 12 highly prestigious Research Institute Scholarships for masters and doctoral students.</p>
<p>Each of the Research Institutes at the University are offering a doctoral scholarship worth up to $85,000 for three years. This includes tuition fees and scholarship instalments over the tenure.</p>
<p>They are also offering a masters scholarship worth $12,000, which includes a fees component of $3,500.</p>
<p>The Institutes offering the scholarships are the Environmental Research Institute (ERI), the Institute for Business Research (IBR), the Institute of Professional Learning (IPL), the National Institute of Demographic and Economic Analysis (NIDEA), Te Kotahi Research Institute (TKRI), and the Wilf Malcolm Institute of Educational Research (WMIER).</p>
<p>Professor Kay Weaver, the University of Waikato’s Pro Vice-Chancellor (Postgraduate Research), says the scholarships will provide applicants with the opportunity to propose and work on a wide range of high level projects with some of the University’s highest calibre academics and research supervisors.</p>
<p>“Our Research Institutes house some of our top international researchers who have attracted a significant amount of research funding for their projects. We are looking for the brightest and best students to come and work alongside them,” she says.</p>
<p>“It’s an ideal opportunity for students to learn from, and work with, world-changing researchers who are leading the way with new ideas. It is also an opportunity for students to test and showcase their own ground breaking research ideas in the supportive and innovative Research Institute<br>environment.”</p>
<p>The Research Institutes undertake world-class research in environmental science, demography and economic analysis, business and leadership, professional learning and development, education, and Māori and indigenous development.</p>
<p>Applications for the Research Institute Scholarships close 30 June. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.waikato.ac.nz/research/scholarships">www.waikato.ac.nz/research/scholarships</a>.</p>
