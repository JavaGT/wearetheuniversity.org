<p><strong>Thursday, 15 May 2014, 5:13 pm</strong><br><strong>Speech: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong><br>New Zealand First Leader<br>15 May 2014</p>
<p><strong>Budget in Reply Speech<br>Thursday 15 May, 4pm</strong></p>
<p>Speaking on behalf of the fastest rising political party in New Zealand, New Zealand First says that in this National Party Budget –</p>
<p>CRONIES GET CAKE - KIWIS GET CRUMBS.</p>
<p>This Budget is exclusively for members of the National Club - there is little for the people.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take the heat off Judith Collins.</p>
<p>Where is the practical economic strategy to address the weaknesses of the economy and growing inequality?</p>
<p>Shameful inequality in New Zealand is clear and deeply troubling.</p>
<p>This Budget will benefit National’s cronies.</p>
<p>Everyone from Balclutha to Beijing now knows the best Blue Chip investment to make in New Zealand is a donation to the National Party.</p>
<p>The weakness of the economy is there for anyone who lifts the engine bonnet to see what is really happening with the engine.</p>
<p>Despite the best terms of trade in decades we still have a chronic balance of payments deficit that the Budget pretended was not there.</p>
<p>Where is the action on the fact that we have not had a balance of payments surplus for years?</p>
<p>CRONIES GET CAKE- KIWIS GET CRUMBS</p>
<p>Over the period between the end of 2008 and 2013 Australia’s economy grew 13%.</p>
<p>Singapore grew over 28%.</p>
<p>And New Zealand grew 8%.</p>
<p>You call that a rock star economy!</p>
<p>Under this Government, New Zealand is heading to rock bottom.</p>
<p>So there is a small, highly contrived, budget surplus – like some backdoor bookkeeper’s balance.</p>
<p>Look at the facts.</p>
<p>When National came into Government, crown debt was $10 billion – now it is $60 billion.</p>
<p>Six times the increase in debt – from the brilliant money trader and the economic genius from Dipton!</p>
<p>Which begs the real question - how was this so called surplus generated?</p>
<p>If this was a private company the auditors would be in jail!</p>
<p>Lots of smoke and mirrors - all sorts of cuts and devices have been used.</p>
<p>We have a massive problem with hundreds of rotting school class rooms – there have been scores of cuts in crucial public service areas such as conservation and bio-security.</p>
<p>And what of forgotten Christchurch?</p>
<p>Worst of all, what sort of Government holds back money from the Christchurch rebuild to manipulate a surplus?</p>
<p>You don’t have to tell the people of Christchurch facing another terrible winter - they know that they are being sacrificed so the Government can boast about its books.</p>
<p>Tell the Christchurch people whose homes are flooded every time it rains that the fiddled books are more important than their lives.</p>
<p>Holding back on the vitally needed money to rebuild Christchurch to generate the so called surplus amounts to a crime against our own people.</p>
<p>The facts are clear – the Government has jacked up the numbers from an insurance deal when AMI was taken over.</p>
<p>AMI was turned into Southern Response Earthquake Services and there the fiddling started.</p>
<p>The proceeds from this sale amounted to $252 million which was placed in government bonds rather than settle insurance claims.</p>
<p>A government deal with Southern Response requires them to put surplus cash on its books into government bonds as well.</p>
<p>This has been boosted by money coming in from reinsurance companies – also going into government bonds.</p>
<p>How much? They now hold over half a billion in government bonds.</p>
<p>The interest on the bonds alone equals the surplus.</p>
<p>Bill English boasted about it today.</p>
<p>So – behold – the books balance!</p>
<p>Let these economic gurus from the National Cronies Club go and tell the Christchurch people in broken homes, begging for relief, what is happening to their relief.</p>
<p>UNDER NATIONAL CRONIES GET CAKE - KIWIS GET CRUMBS</p>
<p>And what about jobs?</p>
<p>Where in this Budget is there a real – measurable action plan for jobs?</p>
<p>There are still almost 150,000 unemployed.</p>
<p>And if you add those who want to work but who have become under employed, or just given up trying, the number is more like 250,000.</p>
<p>Unemployment is our single biggest problem.</p>
<p>Kiwis can’t get jobs but tens of thousands of foreign students and immigrants are given work visas.</p>
<p>UNDER NATIONAL CRONIES GET CAKE- KIWIS GET CRUMBS</p>
<p>Where is the action plan in the Budget for the cost of living?</p>
<p>Over half those employed in New Zealand had no pay increase last year.</p>
<p>Wages are stagnating.</p>
<p>But costs are going up.</p>
<p>The electricity sector is generating price hikes and gouging the public without restraint.</p>
<p>Another cold winter for pensioners and low income families.</p>
<p>UNDER NATIONAL CRONIES GET CAKE - KIWIS GET CRUMBS</p>
<p>Where in the Budget is the plan for halting the fire sale of New Zealand?</p>
<p>The Budget does nothing to counter the loss of our productive asset base.</p>
<p>Much of our prime agricultural land has gone into foreign ownership.</p>
<p>Many New Zealand workers have ended up as cheap labour for overseas investors to exploit.</p>
<p>Why is there no action?</p>
<p>BECAUSE UNDER NATIONAL CRONIES GET CAKE - KIWIS GET CRUMBS</p>
<p>Where is the admission that the housing crisis is due to National’s incompetence?</p>
<p>For almost six years National has allowed, indeed promoted, a housing crisis by blatantly ignoring all the underlying causes.</p>
<p>Everyone with a brain knows that tens of thousands of Auckland houses have been gobbled up by overseas buyers – it’s been a bonanza for foreigners.</p>
<p>Foreigners come here with no restrictions – no requirements - no taxes. Come one come all.</p>
<p>Treasury predicts migration to go up to over 41,000 people a year.</p>
<p>National have been behaving like the “fifth column” that is actually working for foreigners and not their own citizens.</p>
<p>What we have seen is National’s utter madness in the face of the facts on foreign buyers of our housing stock.</p>
<p>And of course they do not want facts – they much prefer dogma.</p>
<p>REMEMBER, UNDER NATIONAL CRONIES GET CAKE - KIWIS GET CRUMBS</p>
<p>Where is there a real infrastructure plan that goes beyond building more motorways?</p>
<p>The Budget has done nothing significant for infrastructure.</p>
<p>Auckland has a deep infrastructure deficit thanks to rapid population growth and decades of underinvestment in public transport.</p>
<p>The Budget could have grasped the nettle and committed to the Auckland City Rail<br>Link - but that would have required vision.</p>
<p>But no, as usual, National has taken the easy way out and kicked this vital project into the long grass.</p>
<p>Why is there no plan to promote regional growth?</p>
<p>Why does this Government keep breaking the heart of the heartland?</p>
<p>Yet again there is nothing substantial or meaningful in the Budget for the regions.</p>
<p>They produce export wealth and in return get exploited!</p>
<p>WHO BENEFITS? CRONIES GET CAKE - KIWIS GET CRUMBS</p>
<p>The 2014 Budget has been weighed in the balance and has been found wanting<br>It is shallow – and empty.</p>
<p>New Zealand deserves better - and after 20 September New Zealand First will ensure we get a real economic strategy for the challenges our country faces.</p>
<p>We are going to go back to the glory days of New Zealand in the past to give you a better New Zealand of the future.</p>
<p>We neither believe in blanket socialism or neo-liberal economics.</p>
<p>We do not believe in selling our land to foreign interests and we believe that state owned assets should be held in trust for the people.</p>
<p>The Government’s role is to protect and defend the people - to be guardians of the country’s resources.</p>
<p>It must help the people reach their potential through sound and enlightened health, education, housing and employment policies.</p>
<p>They all say it – but New Zealand First acts on it.</p>
<p>We also believe in special obligations to the old and the young – society’s most vulnerable.</p>
<p>We believe in one law for all – irrespective of ethnic background.</p>
<p>Not the crumbs of tokenism from the Cronies Club Tables!</p>
<p>We believe that Maori needs are the same as all New Zealanders. They need good education, housing, health facilities and most of all they need good paying jobs.</p>
<p>New Zealand First believes that we must train, skill, educate and employ our own people first.</p>
<p>There’s no excuse for the hiring of cheap labour from overseas when so many are on the unemployment scrap heap back here.</p>
<p>On the issue of foreigners speculating on housing in New Zealand – we’ve had the courage to say it for years but successive governments have refused to act.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s economy suffers from not having a practical plan for its people.</p>
<p>Blind ideology is not a substitute.</p>
<p>The current economic vision is simply the Auckland housing bubble, increased immigration creating consumer demand, the staggered Christchurch rebuild, and milk powder to China.</p>
<p>We cannot survive without a much more diversified economy.</p>
<p>National should hang their heads in shame.</p>
