<p>Christchurch flood victims cut out of Budget 2014</p>
<p>Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee is ignoring the facts by denying that the Christchurch earthquakes have exacerbated flooding, Green Party Christchurch spokesperson Eugenie Sage said today.</p>
<p>The Earthquake Commission, City Council and other studies have concluded that the earthquakes caused land damage to residential land, riverbeds and the bed of the estuary which has exposed residents in parts of Christchurch to more frequent and more severe flooding than previously.</p>
<p>“Budget 2014 should have recognised and responded to the increased flood hazard problem. It should have set aside funding to buy out householders affected by flooding,” Ms Sage said.</p>
<p>“The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) and Minister Brownlee need to tackle flooding in Christchurch as part of CERA’s strategic priorities.</p>
<p>“Residents should not have to suffer repeated inundation of their homes and properties with no option but to stay put and endure or somehow pay for alternative accommodation.</p>
<p>“Normally flooding issues would be dealt with by local councils but not in this case given the earthquake related land damage.</p>
<p>“There needs to be a partnership between central Government and the Christchurch City Council and ECan.</p>
<p>“The Minister charged with earthquake recovery must take this issue seriously and put resources into solving it, given the human misery caused by the flooding,” Ms Sage said.</p>
<p>“The Green Party has proposed a Blue Zone offer that would enable those householders worst affected by flooding the chance to be bought out on a voluntary basis rather than the compulsory buyout which has occurred in the residential Red Zone.”</p>
