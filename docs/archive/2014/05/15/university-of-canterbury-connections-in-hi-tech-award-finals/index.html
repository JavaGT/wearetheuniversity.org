<p><strong>University of Canterbury connections in NZ Hi Tech award finals</strong></p>
<p>May 15, 2014</p>
<p>Three University of Canterbury connections are involved in the New Zealand Hi-Tech Awards to be announced in Christchurch tomorrow night (Friday).</p>
<p>They are university graduate New York-based Guy Horrocks, co-founder of the world’s first iPhone app company, Polar Bear Farm, academics Professor Phil Butler and Associate Professor Anthony Butler who head a university spin-out company Mars Biomaging, and Craig Nevill-Manning will act as a judge.</p>
<p>Horrocks has received attention from Apple and helped pioneer the jailbreak market - the only way to get an app on cellphones before Apple launched the iTunes App Store. Horrocks also worked on the 2012 US elections with CNN and TIME magazine. Unlimited magazine named Horrocks as one of the top influencers in New Zealand to watch in 2013. His company, Carnival Mobile, is a finalist in the Hi Tech software product award.</p>
<p>Mars Bioimaging, which uses 3D imaging to improve the treatment of diseases, is a finalist in the company of the year and hardware product of the year.</p>
<p>University of Canterbury computer science graduate and UC Honorary Doctor Craig Nevill-Manning is Director of Engineering for Google in New York.</p>
