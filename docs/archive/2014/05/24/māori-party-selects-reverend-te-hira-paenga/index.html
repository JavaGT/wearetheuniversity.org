<p><strong>Māori Party Selects Reverend Te Hira Paenga as Te Tai Tokerau candidate</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Saturday 24 May 2014</strong>  </p>
<p>The Māori Party is delighted to welcome into their team of Election 2014 candidates, Rev Te Hira Paenga; of Ngāti Hine, Ngāti Kahu ki Torongare, Ngāti Rangi, Te Māhurehure, Ngāti Konohi, Ngāti Rangi, Te Whānau ā Ruataupare ki Tūpāroa.</p>
<p>“Te Hira is at the forefront of a new generation. He will be the first graduate of kōhanga reo, kura kaupapa Māori and wharekura to enter into Te Whare Miere – and we know he will carry out that responsibility with great honour and respect” said Rangimarie Naida Glavish, President of the Māori Party.</p>
<p>“Māori are a very youthful population. The median age of Māori was 23.9 years in the 2013 Census. Te Hira brings with him the vigour of youth and the passion of a preacher, to respond to the urgent needs of an electorate that needs an MP who will front up to the people, and listen to their concerns, their priorities and most of all their dreams” said Charles Joe, Māori Party chairperson for Te Tai Tokerau electorate.</p>
<p>“He has told our electorate team that his first task for the 2014 General Election will be the mobilisation and activation of rangatahi Māori and we will all be there right behind him”.</p>
<p>“I’m really excited about the opportunity to be the best servant I can for the people of the North” said Rev Te Hira.</p>
<p>“My vision for Te Tai Tokerau comes from the vision we share as a whānau – to focus on doing all that we can to improve wellbeing, to nurture creativity, foster excellence and encourage self-determination”.</p>

<p>“Those are the kaupapa that drew me to the Māori Party ten years ago – and they are kaupapa I will be proud to uphold on behalf of my tupuna and in the interests of all our tamariki and mokopuna. I can’t wait to begin”.</p>
