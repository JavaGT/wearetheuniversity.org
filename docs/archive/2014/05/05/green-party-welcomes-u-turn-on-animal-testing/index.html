<p>Green Party welcomes U-turn on animal testing</p>
<p>The Green Party welcomes the National Government’s U-turn on animal testing of legal highs, Green Party MP Mojo Mathers said today.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Key has finally ruled out animal testing on legal high products.</p>
<p>“During the passage of the Psychoactive Substances Act, National voted against a Green Party amendment that would have ruled out the use of data from animal testing of legal highs,” said Ms Mathers.</p>
<p>“Their failure to support my amendment at that time meant that it was likely that animals were going to be subjected to cruel tests.</p>
<p>&quot;Animal toxicology testing involves very high levels of suffering. There was no need for these particular tests as there are non-animal testing alternatives that give as good, or better, results.</p>
<p>“This move will see non-animal tests being used more widely and will drive further development of non-animal tests.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to thank the tens of thousands of people who have campaigned tirelessly against animal testing of recreational drugs. It is public pressure that has convinced the government to change its mind.</p>
<p>“This is a victory for animals and for the wider New Zealand public.</p>
<p>“Animals shouldn’t have to suffer or die for the sake a legal high, and it is great to see that National have accepted that,” Ms Mathers said.</p>
