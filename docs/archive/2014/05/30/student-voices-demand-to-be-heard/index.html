<p><strong>Friday, 30 May 2014, 2:28 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students'_Association">Otago University Students&#39; Association</a></strong></p>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p><strong>Student Voices Demand to be Heard</strong></p>
<p>Students have told the Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) which issues they want energy focused on in this year’s general election. The annual referendum showed students are still feeling the financial pinch, and proved there is overwhelming support for student voices to be heard on the Otago University Council.</p>
<p>“It makes sense that we want our voices heard; students are the primary reason for tertiary education,” said Ruby Sycamore-Smith, OUSA President. “There is no stakeholder group with more incentive to speak up for education quality as well as efficient and effective universities to ensure the best possible outcomes for students.”</p>
<p>The results backed up previous years’ votes showing students overwhelmingly support a universal student allowance in response to harder times and greater hardship students are enduring to get an education.</p>
<p>“The OUSA has a fundamental concern with student welfare. Financial hardship creates constant stress for too many students, so it’s no surprise that our students have reaffirmed our existing policy of supporting a Universal Student Allowance,” said Sycamore-Smith.</p>
<p>But in a move that may surprise those who have been to a flat dinner in the past, there was overwhelming support for the removal of goods and services tax (gst) from fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>“It’s not all mince pies and sausage pasta down here; the majority of students are health conscious group and actively take steps to try make their lives better,” said Sycamore-Smith. ”Supporting the removal of gst from fruit and vegetables would certainly make it easier to add these to the flat shopping list.”</p>

<p>The OUSA will campaign for all three positions this general election.</p>
<p><strong><em>Student Bar</em></strong><br>“Some might assume that investigating a student bar would be a slam dunk proposal to the student body, but we know opinion is mixed.” said Sycamore-Smith.</p>
<p>“It is generally accepted that it’s safer for students to be drinking on or closer to campus in a safer more controlled environment. The North Dunedin area has lost a number of historically famous pubs. This is not about buying The Cook; it is about responding to a genuine health and safety problem and taking good advice on appropriate responses.”</p>
<p><strong><em>Legalising Marijuana</em></strong><br>“What students believe should not be taken for granted or stereotyped,” said Ruby Sycamore-Smith. The OUSA supports the decriminalisation of marijuana from past votes but the OUSA wanted to see if the impact of legislation changes that made synthetic substances illegal had had an impact on the demand for legalising marijuana.</p>
<p>“The vote shows students aren’t strongly pro-legalising marijuana which goes against the typical media portrayal of students. It really is great to know student opinions on such contentious issues, it’s that student voice gives us direction in the areas we should be focusing our attention.”</p>
<p>“Overall the referendum results shows that voting matters. Our ambition for this coming election is that Every Student Votes. Nothing can be assumed; every vote counts.”</p>
