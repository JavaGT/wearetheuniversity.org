<p><strong>Four University of Canterbury students win Todd Awards</strong></p>
<p>May 30, 2014</p>
<p>Four University of Canterbury students are among 10 New Zealand university students to receive Todd Awards for Excellence in universities.</p>
<p>The awards support projects that promote excellence and encourage the development of new concepts, technology or research which will benefit New Zealand. The Todd Foundation Awards for Excellence (Universities) are granted in a field of study which is likely to benefit New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Canterbury students to receive awards were Sophie Hunt, Jin Bum Hong, Nathaniel Gunby and Joshua Smaill.</p>
<p>Sophie Hunt is investigating how global environmental changes will affect native species decline and invasive species spread. Hong is evaluating the security of network systems to protect businesses, especially small businesses, from cyber threats.</p>
<p>Gunby is researching coating materials including resistance to wear and tear, fabricating microelectronic devices and reducing glare in optics. Smaill is investigating an essential micronutrient for plants and an important component in fertilisers.</p>
<p>University of Canterbury’s Professor Lucy Johnston, Dean of Postgraduate Research and convenor for the awards committee says to have four of the 2013 awardees from the University of Canterbury was an outstanding achievement and testimony to the high quality of innovative research being carried out by Canterbury thesis students. The success in 2014 follows that in 2013 where three of the eight awardees were from Canterbury.</p>
