<p>Safe Rebuild Canterbury and Hazel Armstrong’s lifelong commitment honoured</p>
<p>Tonight in Auckland is the tenth anniversary of the Safeguard Health and Safety awards, awards which recognise individuals and organisations which have made workplaces safer.</p>
<p>The CTU is delighted that long term health and safety activist, Hazel Armstrong, has tonight been awarded, at the Safeguard New Zealand Workplace Health and Safety awards, the Countdown Lifetime achievement award.</p>
<p>“Hazel has made a phenomenal contribution to the health and safety landscape in New Zealand. Hazel’s commitment to health and safety from a worker perspective is what has made her truly effective. She possesses an exceptional depth of expertise and awareness as a result of her work in the union movement, initially as a health and safety advocate with the Engineers Union before later coming to work at the CTU,” CTU President Helen Kelly said. “Now, as a lawyer specialising in ACC and health and safety, she continues that commitment.”</p>
<p>“She has been a tireless advocate for improved health and safety for more than 20 years. This year Hazel has been appointed as one of three members of the independent Inquiry into forest safety,” Kelly said.</p>
<p>“Safe Rebuild Canterbury is an award winning health and safety initiative. Winner of the ‘Engagement’ category. This project involves a tripartite approach to health and safety – involving the CTU, Business NZ and Central Government, with the parties working together to provide effective training and education on health and safety in traditionally hard to reach small to medium sized businesses involved in the reconstruction of Canterbury. The Canterbury reconstruction project continues to face lots of challenges so it is very positive that there is this forum for parties to raise these challenges and seek solutions,” Kelly said.</p>
