<p><strong>University of Waikato VC announces retirement</strong></p>
<p>University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford will retire at the end of 2014, completing 10 years in the role.</p>
<p>Professor Crawford announced his retirement at the University’s Council meeting on 28 May. He is only the fourth Vice-Chancellor the University has had in its 50 years.</p>
<p>The University’s Chancellor, Rt Hon Jim Bolger, has paid tribute to Professor Crawford, saying he helped the University of Waikato consolidate and then shine on the world stage. “Under Professor Crawford’s leadership, we have seen our University move into the top 2% of universities around the world, including being named in the Top 50 of the young universities in the world, and in the Top 50 in terms of our international outlook.”</p>
<p>Mr Bolger says Professor Crawford has played a key role in focusing the University on an excellence agenda and delivering teaching and research outcomes that help address major issues facing the world today. “Throughout his tenure Professor Crawford has emphasised the importance of having excellent staff and providing them with world-class facilities so that they can compete successfully on the international stage.”</p>
<p>“As an organisation we celebrate our 50th anniversary this year. Professor Crawford should feel proud that he has moved us to a mature position – one on which a new Vice-Chancellor can continue to build.”</p>
<p>Mr Bolger says the University of Waikato Council will begin immediately the process to recruit a new Vice-Chancellor, but this search will not impact on the business of the University. “We have great staff here who work tirelessly to ensure the University delivers excellence in teaching and learning. That work will continue as we embark on the search for a new leader.”</p>
<p>Professor Crawford says he is proud to have led such an innovative and committed organisation. “It really has been an honour and a privilege. I am constantly amazed by the talent and expertise we have at the University of Waikato. It means we are able to make a difference – in the way we educate and encourage our students, in the research we conduct, and to the region and nation.”</p>
<p>&quot;I am also indebted to the Chancellor and members of Council for their strong support throughout my time at the University.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Crawford says leading an organisation with more than 12,000 students, nearly 2000 staff and that contributes nearly $1 billion to the national economy will be an attractive prospect for a new Vice-Chancellor.</p>
<p>Professor Crawford retires from the University of Waikato on 31 December 2014.</p>
