<p>Education Spokesperson<br>29 May 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>McSchool comes to Wellington</strong></p>
<p>The Government should be ensuring all schools are properly funded rather than pumping up to five times more into a proposed new Caribbean-style international franchise charter school in Porirua, Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>“Northgate College will teach five- to seven-year-olds and be run by the Trinidad and Tobago-based Davidic Centre Trust. As a charter school, it will receive much more funding than students in nearby state schools.</p>
<p>“That is simply unfair.</p>
<p>“The Trust says it wants its pupils ‘to grow up with a holistic understanding of the world and their place in it’. Surely we want that for all our kids.</p>
<p>“Importing multinational chains will not create the quality education system Kiwi parents want and deserve for their children.</p>
<p>“Having schools compete against each other for resources is a recipe for disaster in our education system. It is also a waste of time and energy which could be better spent teaching our kids.</p>
<p>“Education Minister Hekia Parata has refused to rule out mergers if the rolls of neighbouring state schools fall after a charter school has opened in the area.</p>
<p>“The five already established charter schools received an extra $9 million over four years in this year’s Budget. These charter schools already receive up to $40,000 per student per year – over five times what local state schools operating in the same areas get.</p>
<p>“Rather than back winners, Hekia Parata must ensure that every school has the resources it needs to give their students the best possible education,” Chris Hipkins says.</p>
