<p>John Key wants beneficiaries to come to Christchurch and camp out  </p>
<p>John Key’s plan to pay beneficiaries to move to Canterbury if they have a job offer is flawed says Ruth Dyson, Labour’s Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson said today.</p>
<p>“Unemployed Kiwis can definitely do with some help, but it is wrong that local unemployed people are not being offered additional support to get into a paid job as well.</p>
<p>“Local jobs for local people is an effective way of better supporting our families and our businesses, but the Prime Minister has overlooked Cantabrians in this package.</p>
<p>“The second challenge that has not been met by Mr Key is the desperate shortage of housing in Canterbury, says Ruth Dyson.</p>
<p>“Where are these people, coming into the region to take up paid work, going to live? There is an increasing shortage of affordable rental properties, more people moving in from overseas to take up work, and more Cantabrians moving out of their homes for repairs or rebuild.</p>
<p>“ There is just nowhere for these new people that the Prime Minister is paying to come to Canterbury, to live. That is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>“ While the basis of the idea of better support for those on benefit to move into paid work is excellent, I want to see Canterbury people helped first and our housing crisis resolved before adding to these problems.”</p>
