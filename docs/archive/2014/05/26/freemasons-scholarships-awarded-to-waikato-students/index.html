<p>Freemasons Scholarships awarded to Waikato Students</p>
<p>Four University of Waikato students have been awarded scholarships totalling $28,000 in the latest round of Freemasons scholarships.</p>
<p>Karen Houghton (PhD in microbiology) received $10,000, Anthony Baker (Master of Business Management), Lindi Engelbrecht (Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)) and Alana Scott (Bachelor of Business Management) each received $6000.</p>
<p>In total, 30 students from New Zealand’s eight universities were presented with Freemasons scholarships totalling $208,000. Sir Ray Avery GNZM - pharmaceutical scientist, inventor and social entrepreneur – awarded students their scholarships in Parliament’s Legislative Council Chamber on 20 May.</p>
<p>At the presentation, Sir Ray stressed how important it was to rally talented people.</p>
<p>“No one is as clever as all of us. All great leaders mobilise the skills of everyone into powerful tools to overcome the impossible.”</p>
<p>Freemasons Grand Master John Litton congratulated parents and families of the scholarship</p>
<p>recipients. All recipients are actively involved in volunteering and supporting people in their networks and communities and achieve consistent excellent academic results.</p>
<p>“As Freemasons, we see one of the benefits of education being a greater tolerance of other people’s views and opinions. Already you have shown this to be so,” says Mr Litton.</p>
<p>For the last 36 years, Freemasons New Zealand - through The Freemasons Charity - has funded nearly $4.42 million in scholarships to 1051 students. Its privately funded university scholarship programme is one of New Zealand’s largest.</p>
