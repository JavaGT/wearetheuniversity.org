<p><strong>Monday, 26 May 2014, 9:09 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National selects Hamish Walker as Dunedin South candidate  </p>
<p>The National Party has selected Hamish Walker as its candidate for Dunedin South for the 2014 General Election.</p>
<p>“Dunedin South backed National’s return to Government in 2011 and National is making strong progress for Dunedin families,” said Regional Chair Ele Ludemann.</p>
<p>“Hamish will work hard to win the trust and support of Dunedin South communities. He will be a strong voice for Dunedin if elected on 20 September.”</p>
<p>Mr Walker is a born-and-bred Dunedinite. He attended John McGlashan College and holds a Diploma in Television and Film from Otago School of Media. His family ties to the city stretch over 160 years.</p>
<p>After completing his studies in Dunedin, he moved to Auckland, completed a degree in accountancy, and in 2012 started his own property management business, which is now being franchised.</p>
<p>Alongside his successful business career, Mr Walker has been a youth mentor for young people suffering Type One Diabetes, and lives with the condition himself. He is also a keen sportsman, and is a first class rugby referee who has refereed games around the world.</p>
<p>“Dunedin is my home and I am passionate about the city where I was born and grew up,” said Mr Walker.</p>
<p>“I’ve returned to Dunedin to run because I want Dunedin to be a place more people want to move to and have a family, a place where more students want to stay on when they finish their studies.</p>
<p>“I will be a strong and passionate voice in John Key’s National Party for the people of Dunedin South if elected in September.”</p>
