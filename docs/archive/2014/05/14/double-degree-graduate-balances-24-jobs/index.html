<p>Olena Khytko  </p>
<p>Most students don’t leave university with a six-page CV.</p>
<p>But most students haven’t worked more than 24 part-time jobs while also completing a double degree over four years.</p>
<p>Olena Khytko is graduating this week from Victoria University of Wellington with a Bachelor of Laws and Bachelor of Commerce majoring in Economics. She admits she hasn’t had a normal student lifestyle but says she wouldn’t change a thing about her study years.</p>
<p>Olena learnt about the different work roles through Student Job Search, and was able to be employed in a wide variety of sectors including hospitality, administration and research.</p>
<p>“The amount of work experience I have gained throughout my studies means I have a job straight out of university and I don’t have a student loan.”</p>
<p>After graduation, Olena will be moving to San Diego to continue working as a legal assistant for BIS2, a visual software company. After she is admitted to the bar, she will join their legal department and take up a graduate role as legal counsel.</p>
<p>Olena’s advice to students is to take advantage of every opportunity being offered.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel like I have missed out on any aspects of student life. I always managed to make time for all my other interests.”</p>
<p>Not only did Olena do paid work, she also volunteered for specialised animal rescue. This included helping out in Christchurch after the February 2011 earthquake.</p>
<p>Olena’s future ambitions include working across all aspects of the law, before possibly joining the police, which is something she has always wanted to do. Her ultimate dream is to become Police Commissioner.  </p>
