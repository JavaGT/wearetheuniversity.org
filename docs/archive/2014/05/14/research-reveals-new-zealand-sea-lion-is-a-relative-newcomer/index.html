<p><strong>Research reveals New Zealand sea lion is a relative newcomer</strong><br><strong>Embargoed until 11am Wednesday 14 May 2014</strong></p>
<p>The modern New Zealand sea lion is a relative newcomer to our mainland, replacing a now-extinct, unique prehistoric New Zealand sea-lion that once lived here, according to a new study led by University of Otago researchers.</p>
<p>A team of biologists from the University of Otago estimates that this prehistoric mainland sea-lion population became extinct as recently as 600 years ago, and was then replaced by a lineage previously limited to the waters of the cold subantarctic.</p>
<p>The Marsden-funded study, carried out by Otago Zoology PhD student Catherine Collins, and led by Professor Jon Waters, set out to investigate changes in the New Zealand sea-lion population since human settlement.</p>
<p>Ms Collins says they were startled to identify a previously unknown sea-lion lineage that dominated South Island shores until just a few hundred years ago.</p>
<p>“It is estimated that the mainland sea-lions became extinct between 1300 and<br>1500AD, soon after Polynesian settlement, and midden remains suggest they were hunted extensively. The extinction apparently created an opportunity for the subantarctic lineage to colonise New Zealand’s mainland,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>The team identified the extinct mainland sea-lion lineage using ancient DNA from prehistoric bones.</p>

<p>“We found that the extinct mainland population was clearly genetically distinct from the modern subantarctic population that arrived more recently,” she says.</p>
<p>The unexpected finding closely mirrors a prehistoric extinction-replacement event for yellow-eyed penguins, recently detected by the same team led by Professor Waters.</p>
<p>“Our findings demonstrate that our current sea-lion population is not a declining remnant of an original mainland population, but rather represents a new arrival from the subantarctic,” he says.</p>
<p>“Competition between the two lineages may have previously prevented the subantarctic lineage from expanding northwards to the mainland of New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Waters adds that all they know for certain about the attributes of this prehistoric sea-lion is that it was genetically distinct from the modern sea-lion lineage. He anticipates that future study of the prehistoric remains will lead to a greater understanding of its biology.</p>
<p>The team’s findings have been published today in the international biological<br>research journal <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.</em></p>
