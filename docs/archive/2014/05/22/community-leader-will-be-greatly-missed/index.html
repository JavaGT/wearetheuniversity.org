<p>Su’a William<br>SIO<br>Pacific Island Affairs Spokesperson</p>
<p>22 May 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Community leader will be greatly missed</strong></p>
<p>Members of the Pacific communities are today mourning the loss of Sione Liava’a, a passionate senior Tongan community leader from South Auckland, who leaves behind a strong legacy as a Pacific advocate.</p>
<p>“Sione was a lovely, gentle and kind man who dedicated his life to serving his community. He did not seek positions to satisfy any personal or egotistical pursuit, rather he sought to work in unity with all cultures and ensure Pacific people contributed our fullest potential to the decisions of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>“He was a passionate advocate for education and served on numerous organisations either as the leader of ex-students association from his former home in Tonga, a Pacific parents’ school committee member, or as a trustee on the Board of the Auckland Grammar School.</p>
<p>“He will be remembered by many from the old Manukau City Council days as a strong and sensible advocate who served first as a member of the Manukau City Safer Community Council and then for two terms on the Pacific Islands Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>“Sione received a QSM last year for his community work. He fully deserved that recognition.</p>
<p>“More recently he was a paid up member of the Labour party who wanted to encourage his beloved Tongan community to participate fully in elections and fight for social justice for all. My colleagues and I will miss his warm smile and his wonderful kindness.</p>
<p>“Our sincere condolences and sympathies go to his wife Christine and his three adult children, whose education success he was immensely proud of.”</p>
