<p><strong>Thursday, 22 May 2014, 12:29 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National confirms Paula Bennett as Upper Harbour candidate</p>
<p>The National Party has selected Paula Bennett as its candidate for the Upper Harbour electorate at the 2014 General Election.</p>
<p>Mrs Bennett first became an MP in 2005, and in 2008 won the West Auckland seat of Waitakere, which she won again in the 2011 election, and was abolished in this year’s electoral boundary review.</p>
<p>“I’m grateful for the party’s endorsement to campaign for the support of Upper Harbour to become its first MP,” said Mrs Bennett</p>
<p>“It’s a big challenge to run in a new electorate but it’s a challenge I’m up for, and I’m looking forward to hitting the ground running when the campaign kicks off.”</p>
<p>The new electorate of Upper Harbour covers both West Auckland and the North Shore, and includes Massey, West Harbour, Hobsonville, Greenhithe and Glenfield.</p>
<p>“National has a strong record of working hard for both West Auckland and the North Shore and I’m glad to have a foot in both areas,” Mrs Bennett said.</p>
<p>“I’ll be campaigning on making sure the people of Upper Harbour enjoy the opportunities that come from a strong, growing economy like New Zealand’s.”</p>
<p>“I’m a proud member of a party that has steered this country through some very tough times over the past few years and we will continue to work hard to help people get ahead.”</p>
