<p>Budget announcements great news for Hunua residents</p>
<p>Last week’s Budget announcements are great news for local residents, says Andrew Bayly, the National party candidate for Hunua.</p>
<p>“We have around 20,000 local families who will be better off through cuts to ACC levies, and free doctor visits for children aged 13 and under will mean a better, healthier younger generation in our region,” Mr Bayly says.</p>
<p>“The children and families package will provide even more support for early childhood education for the 5,000 Under-5s that are our area’s future.</p>
<p>“Extending paid parental leave is another feature of the Budget, which will have a positive impact on our families. I am delighted that this National-led government is also focussing on tertiary education, with almost $80 million being put into reducing costs for tertiary courses in science and agriculture.</p>
<p>“My vision for our electorate is ‘Growing Hunua, Stronger Local Communities’, and this Budget goes a long way towards growing our district,” Mr Bayly says.</p>
<p>“Transport to and from Auckland gets a boost, thanks to a $375 million interest-free loan which has been dedicated to improving our local roading networks.”</p>
<p>Mr Bayly says other Budget announcements will mean benefits for locals from every part of the electorate.</p>
<p>“Whether you are from Beachlands, Clevedon, Pukekohe, Clarks Beach, Waiuku or<br>anywhere in between, the announcement that ACC is on track to cut levy costs, potentially offering big savings for close to 20,000 local families.</p>

<p>“Our rural landscape is close to my heart, and it is great news that there will be $25 million in funding to invest in research and monitoring and preventative measure for Kauri dieback, along with $20 million for freshwater management, including helping communities with wetland creation.</p>
<p>“The Franklin region has a large number of wetland areas and has been at the forefront of riparian planting. Kauri dieback is a significant issue – three different trees in the Wattle Bay area have been identified as carrying the pathogen, and although the Hunua Ranges so far appear to be disease-free, this funding is vitally important for the region.”</p>
<p>Mr Bayly says his vision of ‘Growing Hunua’ is underpinned by five key strategies: making sure Hunua’s voice is heard loud and strong at Auckland Council; ensuring our region, and our communities, get the infrastructure we need; having access to good health services, provided locally; promoting our growers, farmers and the equine industry; and creating an environment where our businesses can flourish to create local jobs.</p>
<p>“What makes our region is strong communities, communities that are self-supporting but that also provide support to each other. Last week’s Budget delivered for New Zealand – and it delivers for Hunua.”</p>
