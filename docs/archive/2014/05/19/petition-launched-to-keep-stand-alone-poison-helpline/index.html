<p><strong>Monday, 19 May 2014, 1:21 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>David</strong><br><strong>CLARK</strong></p>
<p>Associate Health Spokesperson</p>
<p>MP for Dunedin North<br>19 May 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Petition launched to keep stand-alone poison helpline</strong></p>
<p>Labour’s Associate Health spokesperson David Clark has today launched a <a href="https://labour.org.nz/SaveThePoisonsHelpline">petition</a> to keep the national poison centre crisis line separate from a proposed catch-all tele-health service.</p>
<p>The Government is looking to merge Poisonline, Healthline, Quitline, public immunisation advice, a depression initiative, plus gambling, drug and alcohol support services into a one-stop national phone service.</p>
<p>“Having a poison crisis line answered by generic 0800 health service operators is against world best practice and could cost lives.</p>
<p>“No one is against making savings when there is merit in doing so, but it makes no sense when that comes at a cost to the quality of service.</p>
<p>“The current stand-alone service, which receives over half of its $2.8 million funding from Otago University, has been operating successfully for 50 years.</p>
<p>“It has a world class data base that is updated constantly and regularly accessed by other countries’ poisons centres.</p>
<p>“When someone’s life is at stake, seconds are critical – they can be the difference between life and death.</p>
<p>“This process has been less than transparent.</p>
<p>“If Tony Ryall knows something that other countries don’t about best practice in cases like this, then he should let New Zealanders know.”</p>
