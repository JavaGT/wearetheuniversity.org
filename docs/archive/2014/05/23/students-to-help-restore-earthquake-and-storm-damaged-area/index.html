<p>More than 100 university students to help restore earthquake and storm damaged area</p>
<p>May 23, 2014</p>
<p>More than 100 University of Canterbury emerging student leaders will work with the Christchurch City Council this weekend to help restore the earthquake and storm damaged South Brighton Park area.</p>
<p>Emerging leaders’ spokesperson Rosie Bolderston says they will work on a number of projects including native tree planting, a river clean up, walkway maintenance and clearing up windfall debris after the storms that have hit the city in recent times.</p>
<p>&quot;We are keen to engage our students with the Christchurch community and provide service support where we can. Students will be given leadership experience working in teams to address community concerns and help to grow qualities to make a difference to the world around them.’’</p>
<p>The university’s Emerging Leaders&#39; Development Programme is a scholarship for first year students with a substantial leadership training component, including a three-day retreat, community service events and leadership forums.</p>
