<p><strong>Unique opportunity to hear influential experimental rock group</strong></p>
<p>A rare Wellington performance by experimental rock group Eye, featuring influential underground musicians, Peter Stapleton, Peter Porteous and Jon Chapman will launch the exhibition ‘<em>what is a life?’</em> by Kim Pieters at the Adam Art Gallery on Tuesday 27 May.</p>
<p>Eye formed in Dunedin in late 2003. The group performs improvised psychedelic drones, with the rock guitar and drums instrumentation augmented by analogue and digital electronics, shortwave radio, field recordings and Tibetan bells.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1990s, Peter Stapleton collaborated with Kim Pieters, who was very active as an experimental musician playing bass and providing vocals in New Zealand underground ensembles such as Dadamah, Rain, Flies inside the Sun, Pieters/Russell/Stapleton, DoraMaar and Sleep. Together they founded the Metonymic music label and began the Dunedin experimental music festival ‘Lines of Flight’ in 2000. Eye’s performance will be accompanied by the live projection of one of Pieters’ moving-image projections, a feature of many of their sound performances.</p>
<p>The individual members of Eye have an extensive history of involvement in New Zealand experimental music as musicians, writers, and music label and festival curators. Eye has been described by UK music writer David Keenan as performing “haunted electro-séances”. Their latest LP, <em>Winterwork</em>, has recently been released on Scottish label Nyali.</p>
<p>This is only the second time Eye has performed in Wellington and the first time at the Adam Art Gallery.</p>
