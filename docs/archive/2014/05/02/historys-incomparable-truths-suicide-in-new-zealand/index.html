<p>History’s incomparable truths: Suicide in New Zealand</p>
<p>Suicide is a major 21st century problem, but one with a much longer history.</p>
<p>Social historians, medical historians, and specialists in suicide studies face a common challenge in investigating the issue; a shortage of authentic experience.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s coronial inquests offer ways to answer the challenge. Professor John Weaver from McMaster University, Ontario is giving a free public lecture at the University of Waikato in May on the history of suicide in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Many of the patterns evident across the century reveal gender differences in respect to work, says Professor Weaver. “For example the ‘breadwinner ideology’, relationships, violence, and alcohol abuse.”</p>
<p>His talk titled ‘History’s Incomparable Truths: The Gender Gap and Self-Destructive Conduct, New Zealand, 1900-2000’, is based on a larger study where coronial records, newspaper reports and other sources were investigated to provide a close-up view of suicide within a much larger historical pattern and account of suicide statistics in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Professor Cathy Coleborne from Waikato’s History Programme says Professor Weaver has strong links with historians in New Zealand, and with colleagues at Waikato University.</p>
<p>“He’s written a powerful work of history which deserves to be read widely.</p>
<p>It tells us about the ways that historians can find out more about the sad histories of topics such as suicide and mental illness, and it puts these into a very powerfully conveyed cultural and social context.”</p>

<p>Professor Weaver has just co-published with McGill-Queen’s University Press in Canada, and Bridget Williams Books in Wellington, Sorrows of a Century: Interpreting Suicide in New Zealand, 1900-2000.</p>
<p>The book focuses on the vexed history of suicide for this nation.</p>
<p>Professor Weaver will give his public lecture on Wednesday 14 May at 6-7pm at the University of Waikato, His book, Sorrows of a Century: Interpreting Suicide in New Zealand, 1900-2000, will be on sale at the lecture.<br>Ends</p>
