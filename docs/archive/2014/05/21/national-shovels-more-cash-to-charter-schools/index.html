<p>National shovels more cash to charter schools</p>
<p>The National Government continues to tilt the playing field in favour of its charter schools experiment by pumping millions of dollars into them while state schools struggle to make ends meet, Labour&#39;s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>“This year&#39;s Budget shovels an extra $9 million over four years at the five newly established charter schools. That amounts to $6,000 per student per year on average based on their current enrolments.</p>
<p>“These charter schools already receive up to $40,000 per student per year – over five times what local state schools operating in the same areas get.</p>
<p>“No doubt Hekia Parata will soon be trumpeting what wonderful results these schools are delivering. I&#39;m sure if they received comparable funding, local state schools could deliver an amazing education too.</p>
<p>“Every New Zealand student deserves the opportunity to reach their full potential.</p>
<p>“Rather than tilting the playing field in favour of the select few attending charter schools, Labour will be focused on making sure every school is a great school and every student has the best education possible,” Chris Hipkins says.</p>
