<p><strong>Tuesday, 27 May 2014, 3:08 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/AUT_University">AUT University</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>AUT Professor of Diversity’s new book <em>Work &amp; Worship</em> to help businesses respond to minority religions in the workforce</strong></p>
<p>A new book written by AUT Professor of Diversity Dr Edwina Pio offers insights and advice to organisations with minority religions in their workforces.</p>
<p>“<em>Work &amp; Worship</em> offers a range of possibilities to the issues organisations contend with when dealing with a diverse workforce, in particular a workforce whose religion may be different from the norms of Western Christianity and an Anglo-centric worldview.”</p>
<p>Dr Pio says that while many organisations have taken steps towards greater inclusiveness for diversity in gender, there is still a very strong sacred and secular divide, which means that religion gets left out of diversity policies in organisations.</p>
<p>“The book gets organisations to ask some basic questions such as: Do we have a policy on diversity? How is it defined? Does it include religion? Should policy extend to dress code and food?”</p>
<p>Race Relations Commissioner Dame Susan Devoy spoke at the Work &amp; Worship book launch and has commended Dr Pio’s personal and academic contribution to fostering harmonious relations.</p>
<p>Dr Pio drew on focus groups with more than 200 people and information from the 2013 Census for <em>Work &amp; Worship</em>. The book focuses on five minority religions in New Zealand: Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus, Indian Christians and Zoroastrians.</p>
<p>In the 2013 Census, 46,148 people identified as Muslims, 19,191 as Sikhs, 89,919 as Hindus and 24,585 Indian Christians, while 1.2 million New Zealanders identify with no religion.</p>

<p>“The extensive and robust research with both employees and employers indicates that visible expressions of religious diversity such as wearing a burkha or growing a beard, may mean underemployment or slow career progression for such individuals.”</p>
<p>“Adherence of one’s personal faith could mean the visible expression of one’s religion in the workplace whether it is through the wearing of the veil, the growing of a beard, the carrying of a kirpan (dagger), a computer screen which shows a god with the head of an elephant, or the display of a goddess with many arms.”</p>
<p>Dr Pio said the findings showed a need to develop a more sophisticated understanding of religious diversity here.</p>
<p>“The findings clearly indicate the need to develop a more sophisticated understanding of religious diversity in the workplace, in particular a world of cooperation, good faith and respect where organisations craft and implement policies and practices acknowledging the porosity between the sacred and secular.”</p>
<p>“<em>Work &amp; Worship</em> presents the privileges and obligations of working with a diverse workforce which organisations worldwide as well as in New Zealand have to contend with. What is shared by all these religious groups is a commitment to New Zealand and to live and work in a manner that respects the country, while also adhering to one’s personal faith.”</p>
<p>EEO Trust Chief Executive Bev Cassidy-Mackenzie says the book is important reading for employers, allowing them to understand the business benefits of workers who feel supported in their worship.</p>
<p>“In an increasingly diverse society our workplaces are being called on to accommodate the varied beliefs and practices of their employees. Professor Edwina Pio’s book <em>Work &amp; Worship</em> uses real case studies and contemporary research to offer practical advice on how to support religious adherence in the work environment.”</p>
<p>Edwina Pio is the first Professor of Diversity in New Zealand. She is based in the Management department at AUT University’s Business and Law School. Her newest book <em>Work &amp; Worship</em> investigates religious diversity and suggests how business leaders can script success in their policies and practices by taking into account the growing workforce of minority religions in their organisations.</p>
