<p><strong>Tuesday, 13 May 2014, 9:17 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Celebrating Victoria’s newest graduates</p>
<p>More than 2,220 students will mark the successful completion of their studies this week at six graduation ceremonies being held by Victoria University of Wellington.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Grant Guilford says graduation is a time to celebrate the culmination of many years of dedicated study, inspiration and achievement.</p>
<p>“A Victoria University degree is not gained lightly. I urge graduands not to underestimate the significance of their accomplishment or the depth of pride that their family, friends and teachers—both past and present—all feel in their achievements.</p>
<p>“During their studies at Victoria, our school leavers have matured into confident and knowledgeable young adults, while our adult learners have broadened their horizons and proved to themselves that they are capable of achievements their early circumstances did not allow.</p>
<p>“But as well as celebrating success, graduation week is also a chance to say thank you to parents, families, caregivers and friends for the immense contribution they have made to the milestone of graduation.</p>
<p>“I know that this week’s cohort of Victoria graduates will go on to make a valuable contribution to New Zealand and the world and I wish them every success in their future endeavours.”</p>
<p>During graduation week, 36 PhDs will be awarded, along with 2,509 degrees, diplomas and certificates.</p>
<p>Two honorary doctorates will also be awarded this week—award-winning author of The Luminaries Eleanor Catton will receive an honorary Doctor of Literature and public international law, human rights and criminal law scholar Professor Roger Clark will receive an honorary Doctor of Laws.</p>
