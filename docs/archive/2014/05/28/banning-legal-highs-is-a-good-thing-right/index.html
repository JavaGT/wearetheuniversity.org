<p><strong>Wednesday, 28 May 2014, 3:09 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Banning ‘legal highs’ is a good thing, right?</p>
<p>The recent law change to ban ‘legal highs’ has been widely discussed throughout New Zealand, but what are the implications? Two experts will discuss this controversial topic during a public debate to be held at Victoria University of Wellington next week.</p>
<p>Dr Fiona Hutton, a senior lecturer in criminology at Victoria, and Dr Paul Quigley, an emergency medical specialist and clinical toxicologist at Wellington Hospital, will discuss recent debate about ‘legal highs’ including whether they are harmful and whether or not they should be legally available.</p>
<p>Dr Hutton will open the session by talking about New Zealand drug policy and the notion of ‘robust research evidence’ for prohibition. Should we be doing things differently, and what are the implications for harm reduction?</p>
<p>With experience both on the frontline dealing with drug and alcohol related injury, and as a respected researcher on ‘legal highs’, Dr Quigley also has much to contribute on what should and should not be done to make a difference.</p>
<p>The New Zealand public is arguably more confused than ever about the best way to reduce harm associated with drug use. This presentation provides an opportunity to hear about the implications of recent government policy changes.</p>
<p>Event details:</p>
<p>Public debate on the banning of ‘legal highs’<br>Presented by Dr Fiona Hutton, a senior lecturer in criminology at Victoria University and Dr Paul Quigley, an emergency medical specialist and clinical toxicologist at Wellington Hospital<br>When: 4 June, 12–1pm<br>Where: McLaurin Lecture Theatre 102, Kelburn Campus, Victoria University of Wellington</p>
