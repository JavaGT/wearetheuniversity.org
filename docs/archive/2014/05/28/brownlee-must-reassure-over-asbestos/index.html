<p>Brownlee must reassure over asbestos</p>
<p>OIA attached</p>
<p>Gerry Brownlee must address the concerns around asbestos raised by Canterbury’s chief medical officer and get as much information as possible into the public domain rapidly to provide reassurance for Cantabrians, says Labour’s EQC spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
<p>“Gerry Brownlee is unable to confirm whether or not a review is under way. He needs to cut the bluster and get an investigation underway immediately.</p>
<p>“If it’s good enough for the chief medical officer for Canterbury to be concerned, it should be good enough for Gerry Brownlee.</p>
<p>“Labour has obtained a briefing note from EQC to Gerry Brownlee showing that in May 2013 EQC was aware that it had poor records for asbestos and no coherent strategy for testing. [Briefing note attached, see para 12]</p>
<p>“Nothing appears to have been done since.</p>
<p>“It is incredible that no one is able to say how many damaged homes may have created exposure to asbestos and that in some cases no processes were in place until last year.</p>
<p>“Labour has previously called for an asbestos register of affected houses in Christchurch.</p>
<p>“Gerry Brownlee is unable to provide a straight answer to the people of Christchurch on asbestos exposure. His approach is, as usual, far too combative to provide any answers. Cantabrians have had enough.</p>
<p>“Residents and rebuild workers have every right to be concerned that they may have been exposed to asbestos. They must be reassured as soon as they possibly can,” says Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
