<p><strong>Tuesday, 9 September 2014, 3:32 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>All Black-Samoa game a win for fans  </p>
<p>Confirmation that the All Blacks will play in Samoa next year is a win for the thousands of rugby fans who have been pressing for it to happen, Labour’s Pacific Affairs spokesperson Su’a William Sio says.</p>
<p>“The July match will be the first ever time that the All Blacks have played on Samoan soil. It will go down in history.</p>
<p>“Congratulations must go to the Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi for his tireless campaign that is finally coming to fruition.</p>
<p>“He has never missed an opportunity to share his rugby stories and his desire that the All Blacks play Manu Samoa on Samoan grounds.</p>
<p>“Congratulations are also in order for Tuifaasisina Bryan Williams and the numerous other advocates who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes to make this game a reality.</p>
<p>“Samoa, along with other Pacific nations, has given enormously to New Zealand, not least in the contributions from, among many, Frank Bunce, Michael Jones, Jerome Kaino, Keven Mealamu, Tana Umaga and Julian Savea to All Black rugby.</p>
<p>“I know there will be thousands travelling from New Zealand and around the Pacific to Samoa to watch this historic game. It will be rugby at its very best.</p>
<p>“May the best Pacific team win on the day,” Su’a William Sio said.</p>
