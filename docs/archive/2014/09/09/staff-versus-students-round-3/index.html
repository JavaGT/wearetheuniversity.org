<p>Staff versus Students Round 3</p>
<p>The annual OUSA &amp; University of Otago Community Food Bank Appeal<br>September 18th, OUSA Market Day on Campus</p>
<p>After two years it’s one round each as the University of Otago and the Otago University Students’ Association take on their now annual Dunedin Community Food Bank appeal.</p>
<p>“The Dunedin Community Food banks are in constant need of support and this is just one way students and staff can give a little to help those in need.” Said Ruby Sycamore-Smith, OUSA President. “It’s also a bit of fun seeing who can donate more out of the students and the staff!”</p>
<p>The OUSA will collect the cans at the OUSA Market Day this September 18th, with a Staff vs Students tally being recorded as the day progresses.</p>
<p>“In 2013 staff just beat the students but in 2012 students won resoundingly.” Said Sycamore-Smith. “Now it’s up to this year to see who CAN take the lead!”</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne congratulated the students for making this an important annual event.</p>
<p>“The score for students vs staff is all square and this is the all-important decider. I strongly encourage staff to rise to the challenge and give generously.</p>
<p>Of course, round three is a win-win as the more cans that are collected the better it will be for those in need of support from Dunedin’s food banks,” said Professor Hayne.</p>
<p>Any enquiries and early drop offs can be directed to the OUSA Student Support Centre.  </p>
