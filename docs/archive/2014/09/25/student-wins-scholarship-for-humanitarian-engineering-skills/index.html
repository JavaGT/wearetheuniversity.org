<p><strong>UC student wins scholarship for humanitarian engineering skills</strong></p>
<p>A University of Canterbury student is the only New Zealander to be awarded a scholarship that will utilise her engineering skills for humanitarian projects.</p>
<p>Second year natural resources engineering student Rebecca Forgesson has been awarded the Engineers Without Borders (EWB) Australia Challenge Scholarship.</p>
<p>She is one of only five young engineering students from Australasia to be awarded the scholarship, and is the only New Zealand student to receive it this year.</p>
<p>The EWB Challenge Scholarship recognises high-achieving and values-driven students who are passionate about applying their engineering skills to community development and poverty eradication.<br>Rebecca will now take part in the EWB Challenge Scholarship programme, which provides development opportunities for emerging leaders and a pathway to creating positive change through humanitarian engineering.</p>
<p>During the scholarship, students undertake a range of professional development programmes within the EWB organisation. The programme deepens students’ understanding of an engagement with humanitarian engineering and community development.</p>
<p>Rebecca says she is excited about winning the scholarship and is looking forward to the opportunities the programme will provide.<br>“It is an honour to be recognised by EWB as it is one of the most well-known humanitarian engineering organisations in the world, and an organisation I hope to continue to be involved with in the future.”</p>

<p>To be eligible for the scholarship Rebecca, along with UC students Harry Chapman, Charles Barnes and Alex Newman, took part in the EWB Challenge 2013. They designed a concept for a renewable, self-sustainable energy generation system for a small town in Timor Leste (East Timor).</p>
<p>“We had to consider energy requirements, cultural preferences of the community, budget and how the village would maintain the system.</p>
<p>“It involved researching and selecting the best option for the given brief, and my group selected a wind turbine that could be tilted up and down for maintenance and extreme weather.”</p>
<p>Rebecca hopes to use her skills and knowledge from her degree to design systems that ensure peoples’ basic human needs are met.</p>
<p>“Nearly one billion people in the world don’t have access to clean water, contributing to high illness and death rates.</p>
<p>“As an engineer, I hope to be able to help people gain access to a reliable clean water source through water supply design skills and knowledge that I will develop through my degree.</p>
<p>“Essentially, I want to be able to improve the quality of life of communities living in less developed countries. I want to make a difference with my engineering skills.”</p>
<p>The scholarship programme is coordinated by Engineers Without Borders (EWB) Australia, with the support of BHP Billiton Sustainable Communities.</p>
