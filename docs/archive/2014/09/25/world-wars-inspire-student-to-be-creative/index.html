<p>A Victoria University of Wellington student has used a family connection as inspiration for an entry in this year’s World of Wearable (WoW) Arts show.</p>
<p>In what started as a family project using his great-grandfather’s tools, Troy Stade has created, alongside his parents Martin de Ruyter and Karen Stade, a Bizarre Bra entry.</p>
<p>“My great-grandfather made trench art after World War II, which ignited a bit of a passion for my family.</p>
<p>“It’s been great to see our piece come together.”</p>
<p>The garment is made up of shells from spent bullets which are split in half and then welded and filed to create a petal.</p>
<p>“The petals are shaped like a poppy, which brings in a New Zealand connection,” says Troy, who is studying Law, Japanese and International Relations.</p>
<p>When creating the garment over the last summer break, a neighbour commented on the sounds coming from the Stade’s property.</p>
<p>“They said it sounded like we were fighting a war, with all the noise we were making–hammering and filing.”</p>
<p>Troy’s family, who are from Nelson, are long-standing supporters of WOW, having been to every show since the event began, and have tried to use this experience to help them put together an award-winning garment.</p>

<p>“We’re aiming to be the first Supreme winner of the Bizarre Bra section,” says Troy.</p>
<p>Although the former Nelson College student has been told he has “artists’ hands”, he doesn’t see himself as a particularly creative person.</p>
<p>“Like every boy growing up I enjoyed playing with Lego, but other than some after-school art classes I haven’t done much.”</p>
<p>But he can see how important it is for students to have a creative outlet, especially those studying law.</p>
<p>“Having this creative outlet is cathartic for me.”</p>
