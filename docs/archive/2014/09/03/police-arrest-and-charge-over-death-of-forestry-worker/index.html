<p><strong>Police arrest and charge over death of forestry worker Lincoln Kidd</strong></p>
<p>Today Levin Police have arrested and charged a man with manslaughter in relation to the death of Lincoln Kidd. Lincoln was killed when a tree was felled on him during a tree felling operation on 19 December 2013.</p>
<p>“All forestry employers should know that they are on notice.” CTU President, Helen Kelly, said. “Deaths in forestry are preventable. Employers who fail to ensure the health and safety of their workers should feel the full weight of the law. This prosecution sends an important signal that the criminal law applies in a workplace just as much as anywhere else” Kelly said.</p>
