<p>At least 15 new taxes under National</p>
<p>John Key is the last person to talk about creating taxes, presiding over a Government that has imposed at least 15 new taxes, Labour Leader David Cunliffe says.</p>
<p>“John Key tried a novel line in the debate last night claiming Labour will introduce five new taxes. That was a massive stretch because he tried to include taxes from other parties.</p>
<p>“The truth is that John Key’s Government has imposed at least 15 new taxes:</p>
<p>GST increase from 12.5% to 15%<br>Increased taxes on KiwiSaver<br>Compulsory student loan payment increase from 10% to 12%<br>Increased tertiary fees<br>The 2012 ‘Paperboy’ tax<br>Civil Aviation Authority fees rise<br>Additional fuel tax increase of 9 cents with annual CPI increases locked in for perpetuity<br>Road User Charges increased<br>New annual student loan fees introduced<br>Massive unnecessary ACC levy increases<br>Prescription fees increased by 66%<br>New online company filing fees imposed on businesses<br>Creeping expansion of the scope of Fringe Benefit Taxes - National tried to tax car parks and plain-clothes police uniforms<br>Lowering of Working for Families abatement threshold and increasing the abatement rate, taking money out of the pockets of families<br>Imposing a $900 Family Court fee  </p>
<p>“John Key was also wrong on capital gains tax. The CGT will not apply to the family home – including if the family home is owned through a trust<br>“The Prime Minister is being deliberately misleading. He knows that his sneaky tax increases, such as the rise in GST which he promised would not happen, have massively increased the cost of living for Kiwi families.</p>
<p>“Labour has a positive plan to put people first by creating a better and fairer New Zealand for all,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
