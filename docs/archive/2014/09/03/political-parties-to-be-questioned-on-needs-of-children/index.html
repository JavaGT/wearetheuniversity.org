<p>Political parties to be questioned on needs of children</p>
<p>Political party representatives will be asked to outline their policies in three key areas relating to the needs of children at a public forum being hosted this Friday by the University of Otago, Wellington (UOW).</p>
<p>The event has been co-organised by UOW’s departments of Paediatrics and Public Health, in collaboration with the Tick for Kids coalition.</p>
<p>Chaired by broadcaster Linda Clark, the forum panel will include National’s Paul Foster-Bell, Labour’s Grant Robertson, the Green Party’s Kevin Hague, United Future leader Hon. Peter Dunne, New Zealand First’s Barbara Stewart, the Māori Party’s Marama Fox and Internet Party leader Laila Harre.</p>
<p>Each will be asked to describe their policies on reducing child poverty and disparities in health among children, and improving support for children with disabilities.</p>
<p>UOW’s Head of Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Professor Dawn Elder, says the parties have been asked to share their views on some of the most pressing social and economic issues affecting the well-being of children in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“As children are our country’s future, we look forward to hearing what the main political parties have to say about their policies for children in these three important areas.”</p>
