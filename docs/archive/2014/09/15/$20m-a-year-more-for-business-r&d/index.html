<p><strong>Monday, 15 September 2014, 10:13 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>$20m a year more for business R&amp;D  </p>
<p>A re-elected National Government will invest $20 million a year more in business R&amp;D co-funding through Callaghan Innovation to further lift funding towards the new Business Growth Agenda target of 1 per cent of GDP by 2018, National Party Science and Innovation Spokesman Steven Joyce says.</p>
<p>&quot;Under National we have seen big growth in the number of innovative hi-tech companies investing heavily in R&amp;D to create more unique products and services that are in demand on the world stage,” Mr Joyce says.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen a 25 per cent lift in business R&amp;D activity in just two years, and this latest increase in funding will help lift it again, in a fiscally responsible way.”</p>
<p>The new funding will lift annual amounts available to Callaghan Innovation to incentivise Business R&amp;D from $142 million to $162 million (a 14 per cent increase), and it will translate to a $100 million a year increase in total business R&amp;D investment at the Callaghan Innovation R&amp;D Growth Grant subsidy rate of 20 per cent.</p>
<p>&quot;Lifting business R&amp;D support through Callaghan Innovation&#39;s comprehensive suite of research services, advice, and grants co-funding, is one of the hallmarks of this Government&#39;s Business Growth Agenda,” Mr Joyce says. &quot;It is a key part of our overall cross-government science and innovation investment, which has grown by more than 70 per cent over the last six years to a projected $1.5 billion a year in 2015/16.”</p>
<p>Other initiatives in National&#39;s Science and Innovation Policy include:<br>• Investigating the development of up to three new private sector Regional Science Institutes similar to Nelson&#39;s Cawthron Institute, and Wellington&#39;s Mallaghan Institute.<br>• Completing the rollout of the eleven National Science Challenges to tackle the biggest science-based issues facing New Zealand.<br>• Further boosting primary sector R&amp;D by establishing a Food Safety Science and Research Centre.<br>• Setting up four new Centres of Research Excellence at New Zealand universities.<br>• Implementing the Science in Society project to encourage school students in study science, technology, engineering and maths.<br>• Finalising the National Statement of Science Investments to help guide our next investments in Research and Development as we look to achieve our Government R&amp;D target of 0.8 per cent of GDP over time.</p>

<p>“National has an excellent track record on science and innovation,” Mr Joyce says.<br>“Through the toughest of times we have significantly increased New Zealand&#39;s expenditure in this area.</p>
<p>“Science and innovation is an investment in New Zealand&#39;s future and National will remain focused on both making that investment directly and encouraging private sector investment, on behalf of all New Zealanders.”</p>
