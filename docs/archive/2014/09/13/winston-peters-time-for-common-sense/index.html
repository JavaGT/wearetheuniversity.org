<p><strong>Saturday, 13 September 2014, 8:12 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><em>Levin Public Meeting<br>Saturday 13 September, 10.30am</em><br><em>Levin War Memorial Hall, Chamberlain St</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Time for Common Sense</em></strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to talk to you today.</p>
<p>Levin is one of those towns that has taken its fair share of knocks over the years - but New Zealanders are resilient people.</p>
<p>New Zealand First’s economic policy is that all New Zealanders should share in a well-balanced and thriving economy and that no region should be left behind.</p>
<p>At the outset of my talk today it is important to emphasize that New Zealand First has a strong commitment to regional development in areas such as the Horowhenua.</p>
<p>Our view is that New Zealand is more prosperous when the regions are thriving.</p>
<p>What is not working for towns like Levin and many others throughout New Zealand is having a completely unbalanced economy in which more and more resources are being sucked into Auckland’s bottomless pit at the expense of the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Relative to the rest of New Zealand, Auckland now has a disproportionate role and influence - it’s like London in the UK.</p>
<p>Auckland now consumes vast resources just to cope with basic infrastructure and housing needs, stretched by record net immigration of over 40,000.</p>
<p>So the Reserve Bank is running its monetary policy for Auckland not New Zealand – and everyone else ends up paying higher interest rates!</p>
<p>And because we also have a balanced, common sense, transport policy we would seriously look at electrifying the rail route between Wellington and Palmerston North.</p>

<p>We believe rail has a future in New Zealand and a regular passenger service through Levin to Wellington and Palmerson North would be a big boost for the town.</p>
<p>In comparison with the massive cost of motorway building, improvements to the rail network are very modest in cost.</p>
<p><strong><em>Our Policy Platform</em></strong></p>
<p>In the 2014 election New Zealand First is offering a platform of common sense policies that will bring real improvement to the lives of New Zealanders – now and for well into the future.</p>
<p>Our policies are based on reality – we are not buying into the myth and propaganda of the so called “rock star economy”.<br>A good place to start is with the facts.</p>
<p>140,000 Kiwis are officially unemployed – that is they do not even have one hour of work a week.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands more have given up and become discouraged so do not even appear in the unemployment statistics.</p>
<p>Half the workforce got no pay increase last year.</p>
<p>Government debt stands at $60 billion and is rising.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s overseas debt is a staggering $150 billion.<br>We have a chronic balance of payments deficit.</p>
<p>Dairy prices have fallen 50 per cent since the start of the year.</p>
<p>Home ownership rates are at their lowest since 1951.</p>
<p>Property values have risen on average 33 per cent in Auckland since 2011.</p>
<p>Large numbers of Kiwis families are under real pressure and stress thanks to the high cost of living relative to wages.</p>
<p>You get the picture?</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing rock star about the New Zealand economy.</p>
<p>In fact that expression is an insult to all those New Zealanders struggling to make ends meet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Foreign ownership</em></strong></p>
<p>Foreign buyers have been pushing house and land prices up, making it more difficult for Kiwis to own a house or farm.</p>
<p>Under National over a million hectares have gone into total or majority foreign control.<br>Foreigners are amassing a huge amount of New Zealand land in their portfolios.</p>
<p>New Zealand First will stop non-residents buying houses and land.</p>
<p>We will buy back farms and land sold to foreigners using the Cullen Fund and KiwiFund.</p>
<p>National has avoided collecting details on foreign sales – this is a deliberate attempt to hide the true picture from New Zealanders.</p>
<p>Overseas buyers have advantages over Kiwis – they can get much lower interest rates and have tax advantages.<br>Sales of multiple farms are nothing but corporate raids.</p>
<p>Most other countries don’t sell land to foreigners, so why do we?</p>
<p>New Zealand First is not xenophobic.</p>
<p>We oppose land going to US, UK, Canadians, Israel, Italy, Germany, China.</p>
<p>National tries to shut down public debate by accusations of xenophobia.</p>
<p>New Zealand First will halt and reverse the sale of our county.</p>
<p><strong><em>Taxation: GST off food and rates.</em></strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is committed to putting more money into the pockets of low income earners.</p>
<p>Under our policy, food will be GST free.</p>
<p>For an average family, the savings may well be the difference between a Mum or Dad having the money to travel to work or not.</p>
<p>GST is a tax that hits low income earners much more than the well off.</p>
<p>Lower income families spend most of their income on basic costs like food, rent, power and transport; higher earners still have money left over after paying for the basics.</p>
<p>Most food items in the supermarket will be GST-free.</p>
<p>This is a policy to ease the burden on people on lower incomes.</p>
<p>Residential rates will be GST free – a major reduction in the cost of living for New Zealanders.</p>
<p><strong><em>Seniors</em></strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is committed to keeping NZ Super at 65.</p>
<p>We will also:<br>• Negotiate a winter power discount.<br>• Provide three free doctor’s visits.<br>• Improve the benefits of the Super Gold card.</p>
<p>NZ Super is affordable, at net 4.1% GDP (ie after tax).</p>
<p>Three free doctor’s visits a year will keep people out of hospital – this is better for them and also less cost on our health system.</p>
<p>We’ve crunched the numbers, it won’t cost any more, as long as these regular visits keep 1 per cent of seniors out of hospital.</p>
<p>SuperGold Card carries many benefits – but it is under review by National.</p>
<p>New Zealand First will put a stop to so many older immigrants coming in.</p>
<p>So we have a great policy platform for the 2014 Election.</p>
<p>You know what to do 20 September.</p>
<p>It’s common sense.</p>
