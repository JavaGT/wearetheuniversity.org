<p><strong>Media Release<br>12 September 2014<br>Immediate Release</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Seymour, ACT Epsom Candidate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Internet Party Insults Students</strong></p>
<p>&quot;I sometimes wonder if the Internet Party is giving students an intelligence test,&quot; says ACT Epsom Candidate David Seymour</p>
<p>&quot;Do the Internet Party really think our generation cannot see that it is us who will pay for their election bribes in taxes? Perhaps they think we do not know that students become taxpaying graduates?</p>
<p>&quot;The Treasury predicts a massive government debt blow out (202% of GDP) by 2060, on current trends of demographics and expenditure.<br>&quot;That year happens to be when current students might hope to retire (See the Long-term Fiscal Outlook).</p>
<p>&quot;It’s insulting enough that students are being bribed with their own money. Worse is that overall government expenditure will go up further under the Internet Party and their left wing allies.<br>&quot;If there are no student fees we would expect more ‘lifers’ at University, and responsible students will pay for them too.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT is the only party taking the future tax burdens of current students seriously. We are the only party offering to reduce government expenditure.<br>&quot;Young New Zealanders should be the most concerned of all about election bribe spending.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT is the only party offerring low taxes, less nanny state and labour market policies that will give graduates a chance to get into the workforce to prove themselves in a job.&quot; said David Seymour</p>
