<p><strong>Monday, 8 September 2014, 1:54 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader<br>8 SEPTEMBER 2014  </p>
<p><strong>Calling National to Account on Supergold Card Trickery</strong></p>
<p>National is being sneaky and deceitful about its plans for SuperGold Card travel benefits, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“When New Zealand First exposed the threat to the SuperGold Card benefits Associate Minister of Transport Michael Woodhouse had the gall to deny this on TV One news, putting out a falsehood to thousands of Seniors,” says New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“He is playing the same game of trickery that Steven Joyce played in 2010.</p>
<p>“Mr Joyce, the master of the school payroll disaster Novopay, was caught out making a similar denial and had to backtrack.</p>
<p>“Right now, Mr Woodhouse needs to explain to SuperGold Cardholders what is being discussed behind closed doors between the government and local body transport authorities.</p>
<p>“This looks suspiciously like a deliberate attempt to disguise the reality of cutbacks.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First is calling on National to announce details of changes it is making to the SuperGold Card benefits before the election.</p>
<p>“National has frozen travel benefits for over three years while they undertake a review.</p>
<p>“We know National wants to wind back the free travel component because they are only interested in the bottom line, yet its annual cost would be a third of Novopay which National let spiral out of control.</p>
<p>“SuperGold Card benefits 630,000 Seniors yet National completely ignores the social and psychological benefits.</p>
<p>&quot;We should take nothing for granted with the SuperGold Card in National’s hands.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand First will not let the Government mess around with SuperGold Card which we founded in 2007.&quot;</p>
