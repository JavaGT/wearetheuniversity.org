<p><strong>Science Challenge 11 Funding a Breakthrough For Predominantly-Urban New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>The Government’s announcement of funding for Science Challenge 11 is welcome recognition that New Zealand is now predominantly an urban country, says the New Zealand Centre for Sustainable Cities.</p>
<p>“With 87% of New Zealanders living in cities, we need to think about the important scientific questions this raises”, says Professor Philippa Howden-Chapman, Director of the multi-disciplinary New Zealand Centre for Sustainable Cities which links all universities in New Zealand, NIWA and a number of research institutes.</p>
<p>The announcement on the Science Challenge <em>Building Better Homes, Towns and Cities</em> was made by Hon. Dr Nick Smith at the Building a Better New Zealand conference last week.</p>
<p>“Ensuring that we build sustainable, healthy and safe houses in towns and cities that integrate land-use and transport patterns to facilitate resilience is indeed a critical science challenge,” Professor Howden-Chapman says.</p>
<p>“The significant long-term funding for this important and innovative science challenge, which was high in the public’s ranking, is a real breakthrough.”</p>
<p>The New Zealand Centre for Sustainable Cities is funded by MBIE for a four-year Resilient Urban Futures and is linked to Health Research Council-funded _He Kainga Oranga/_Housing and Health Research Programme.</p>
