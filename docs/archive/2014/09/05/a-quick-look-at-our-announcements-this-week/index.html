<p><strong>Friday, 5 September 2014, 3:37 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>A quick look at our announcements this week</p>
<p>Only National is focused on the issues that matter this election.</p>
<p>Our clear plan for a stronger economy means we can support a cleaner environment, continue our commitment to rebuilding Canterbury, and invest more in major infrastructure for regional New Zealand while still balancing the budget and paying down debt.</p>
<p><strong>If you haven’t seen them yet, here’s just some of the policies we announced this week:</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Working hard to rebuild Canterbury</strong> – We have announced new arrangements to maintain the earthquake rebuild’s momentum by making CERA a departmental agency within the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and reviewing the special earthquake powers.<br>•<br>• <strong>Improving water quality</strong> – Investing $100 million over 10 years to buy and retire selected areas of farmland next to important waterways, while introducing a mandatory requirement to exclude dairy cattle from waterways by July 2017.<br>•<br>• <strong>Ultra-Fast Broadband to 80% of New Zealanders</strong> – Meaning a further 200,000 New Zealanders will have access to fast, more reliable broadband.<br>•<br>• <strong>Support children with special needs</strong> – Providing up to 800,000 more teacher aide hours.<br>•<br>This election is a clear choice between keeping our economy moving in the right direction with stable leadership, or a recipe of five new taxes and big increases in spending with a disorganised Labour-Greens-Dotcom coalition that would stall our economy.</p>
<p>Only a <strong>party vote for National</strong> can provide strong, stable government and keep New Zealand moving in the right direction.</p>
