<p><strong>Green Party Co-leader Russel Norman’s speech - Green Party 2014 election campaign close</strong></p>
<p>Russel Norman MP on Thursday, September 18, 2014 - 13:28</p>
<p>I became the Co-leader of the Green Party in 2006, eight years ago this June.</p>
<p>At that time we were sitting at just above 5 percent in the polls and only had six MPs in Parlia-ment.</p>
<p>I am enormously proud of the work Metiria and I have done to build our party into the stand-alone, third biggest party in New Zealand politics that we are today.</p>
<p>From humble beginnings we have transitioned from a party that used to hold its breath on elec-tion night, wondering if we&#39;d get to 5 percent, to a party heading into this election with a chance of winning the largest number of votes ever in an MMP election, outside of Labour and National.</p>
<p>I love our party. I love our independent and unique space in New Zealand politics.</p>
<p>Where once our mission was to be a catalyst for change that others in power adopted and imple-mented, now we stand on the cusp of being in Government with the opportunity to build a clean-er, fairer, smarter New Zealand ourselves.</p>
<p>Our success has been based on stable leadership, a united team and a crystal clear vision for a better Aotearoa.</p>
<p>Over the last three years, we&#39;ve led the opposition to National&#39;s agenda.</p>
<p>Because of the Greens, New Zealanders stood up to National&#39;s asset sales.</p>
<p>We collected the most signatures ever in a citizens initiated referendum, and we won, despite John Key doing everything he could to stifle New Zealanders&#39; democratic voice (and inevitably ignoring them completely).</p>
<p>Our opposition to the SkyCity deal, and our use of every trick in the book to hold up its construc-tion, has ensured no sod has been turned on National&#39;s convention centre, paid for from the pro-ceeds of problem gambling and human misery.</p>
<p>And our dogged advocacy for clean rivers has meant the issue is now high enough on the politi-cal agenda no party can feasibly ignore it.</p>
<p>These are just three of the many issues Green MPs have campaigned for, fought for, spoken out on, taken risks for.</p>
<p>We may have had only 14 MPs, but we have led the charge to end this National Government.</p>
<p>Stable leadership, a united team and a crystal clear vision for change - key ingredients for suc-cess, and qualities the Greens have in spades.</p>
<p>I want to take a moment to talk about our vision for change.</p>
<p>Because what I especially love about elections (apart from visiting dairy-free ice cream factories like we did this morning) is the generation of new ideas.</p>
<p>In fact my staff have been known to roll their eyes at my commitment to idea generation.</p>
<p>When they think a one or two page briefing paper will do, I want to write a book, or at the very least an essay.</p>
<p>When they say &quot;please Russel, just keep the speech short and sweet&quot;, I sometimes don&#39;t quite hear them (although don&#39;t panic, I have heeded their advice today)</p>
<p>Elections should throw up new thinking to help drive our country forward.</p>
<p>Because the dominant ideas of the last generation are no longer fit for purpose.</p>
<p>They have left our environment and too many of our people in trouble.</p>
<p>We need new thinking to take on the increasingly complex challenges we face as a country, and as a human race.</p>
<p>National has completely failed to grasp this.</p>
<p>When Finance Minister Bill English was asked recently what his one big idea was to boost the New Zealand economy, he drew a blank.</p>
<p>He could not come up with a single new idea to help our country improve and prosper.</p>
<p>National has no road map to a better New Zealand - no vision.</p>
<p>The Greens do.</p>
<p>Ours is a vision built around a very simple idea - that the only kind of economy that will deliver true and long-term prosperity is an economy that accounts for environmental limits and doesn&#39;t leave people behind.</p>
<p>So we&#39;ve put a plan together, and a blue print of how to get there - fully costed I might add, which is more than you can say for the other parties - National included.</p>
<p>We have a billion dollar plan to turn around child poverty and address inequality.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll ensure all our rivers are clean enough to swim in and our beaches free from oil</p>
<p>We&#39;ll protect the last remaining 55 Maui&#39;s dolphins then put in place measures to grow the popu-lation from there.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll tackle climate change as a priority, while ensuring New Zealanders are better off, by taxing polluters and returning the money to households and businesses in the form of tax cuts.</p>
<p>Just yesterday a major new report from leading global economists found investments to help fight climate change can also drive economic development and jobs, but time is running out to make the shift.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get on with it.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll partner with business to invest $1 billion into R&amp;D to spur clean innovation across our economy.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll put solar panels on thousands of homes and schools, reducing power bills and emissions.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll establish a Green Investment Bank to accelerate New Zealand&#39;s low carbon transition.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll secure 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll take money that&#39;s currently going on unnecessary motorway projects and spend it on world-class public transport instead, transforming the way New Zealanders get around.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll complete Auckland&#39;s City Rail Link by 2020.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the 21st century. Let&#39;s embrace the opportunities. We&#39;re New Zealand, this is our time.</p>
<p>For many people, this election will be the first time they vote Green.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve just heard from some of them, but I&#39;ve also spoken to nurses, farmers, labourers, academ-ics, bus drivers, teachers, tech business leaders - who&#39;ll be party voting for us this time, despite traditionally voting elsewhere.</p>
<p>To all those people - great to have you on board.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve led the opposition over the last three years and we&#39;re ready to lead in Government.</p>
<p>It&#39;s over to you now.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s make history. Let&#39;s take our country back.</p>
<p>Love New Zealand. Party Vote Green</p>
