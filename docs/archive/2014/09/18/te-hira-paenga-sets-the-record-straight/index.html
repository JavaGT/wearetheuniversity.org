<p>Te Hira Paenga sets the record straight</p>
<p>In recent days there has been much speculation about my campaign in Te Tai Tokerau. Some commentators have suggested that I should step down or endorse the Labour candidate in an attempt to stop the Internet Party riding on the back of the Mana candidate.</p>
<p>I too am concerned about the abuse of the Te Tai Tokerau seat to bring in people who have no affiliation to or concern for our electorate. Our people, particularly our rangatahi, are sick of the deals that have been made to try and gain political power.</p>
<p>From the time I was elected as the Māori Party candidate for Te Tai Tokerau, I have given my campaign 100 percent. I’ve knocked on thousands of doors, fronted up to countless public speaking events and whole-heartedly promoted the kaupapa of the Māori Party.</p>
<p>Our own polls tell us that the people of Te Tai Tokerau want a change, they want a change where Te Tai Tokerau gets a place at the table, and gains access to the resources that it needs to grow its stagnant economy.</p>
<p>So yes – there is a need to strategically vote in the electorate, in order to ensure that we remove the blot on our democracy, but let me state right now, clearly and for the record, the Reverend is keeping the faith.</p>
<p>Irrespective of all of the speculation that has been circulating, I have no intention of stepping aside and I call upon all Māori party supporters to stay true to the kaupapa and to give me two ticks in Te Tai Tokerau. Only the Māori Party can guarantee Te Tai Tokerau a seat at the table.</p>
