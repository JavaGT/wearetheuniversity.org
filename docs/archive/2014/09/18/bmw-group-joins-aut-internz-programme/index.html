<p><strong>Thursday, 18 September 2014, 12:27 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/AUT_University">AUT University</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>BMW Group joins AUT InterNZ Programme</strong></p>
<p>Eleven lucky AUT graduates will be winging their way to the United States early in 2015 to take up paid internships as part of the expanded AUT interNZ programme. Launched in 2013, the programme gives AUT graduates an opportunity to experience the changing world through workplace scholarships in US-based businesses.</p>
<p>This year, BMW of North America joins a group of industry-leading brands and will offer two six-month internships at its regional sales and distribution campus in New Jersey. This is the first partnership of its type for the Group with a university in the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>“BMW is tremendously proud to be supporting and involved with this engaging initiative which will benefit Kiwi graduates,” said the Managing Director of BMW Group New Zealand, Ms. Nina Englert.</p>
<p>“BMW already has a very strong recruitment operation here in New Zealand with 10 percent of our current workforce being interns, so it’s fantastic to be able to expand and enhance this opportunity to include international placements.</p>
<p>“It’s very rewarding to be able to help facilitate such aspirational opportunities and foster ‘on the job’ learning and development for AUT graduates at BMW of North America in New Jersey.</p>
<p>“It gives these graduates the chance to learn about a large multi-national organisation and it will be a privilege to have two successful AUT graduates working at the best-selling premium automotive brand in the world.”</p>

<p>In total eleven scholarships with be offered in 2015, with opportunities spanning a range of skills, sectors and businesses including Saatchi &amp; Saatchi New York, Paramount Recording Studios Los Angeles and Kiwi Landing Pad in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The programme, the first of its type for a New Zealand university, was created to provide graduates with a new opportunity to put their learning into action in a global context, recognising the benefits this would give each individual as well as future employers.</p>
<p>Last year, nine scholarships were offered, with six of the recipients remaining in market for the duration of their visas, having received extensions to their internships or work contracts.</p>
<p>The experience has been hailed a success by AUT’s US industry partners and by the 2014 scholarship recipients, who said they not only developed new life skills, but learnt how to work in a different marketplace and culture and had a clearer understanding of their future career goals.</p>
<p>AUT’s Vice Chancellor, Derek McCormack, believes that AUT’s InterNZs program, the only one of its kind in NZ, provides our students with cultural and global business knowledge that will influence what they do in their career and study.</p>
<p>“It is well understood that the experience gained and shared by New Zealanders from international travel has a positive impact on our business and the wider economy. The relationships formed and understanding of off-shore systems and the culture around decision making will ensure these AUT graduates can overcome some of the difficulties New Zealanders encounter when trying to attract international research and business funding.</p>
<p>“International research contracts and funding is important for the reputation of our universities and business sector. We, NZ, needs to attract more foreign investment to grow, our InterNZs program is one way we can do that.”</p>
<p>The AUT interNZ scholarship recipients receive return air travel and transfers to their destination city, US visa administration costs, travel and health insurance for the duration of their placement plus stipend towards living and accommodation costs.</p>
