<p><strong>PPTA Running a Desperate Campaign Against Partnership Schools</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The PPTA is misguided. Epsom is blessed with wonderful schools&quot; said ACT Epsom candidate David Seymour.<br>&quot;We believe that Epsom voters want good schools for their children, and for all children in New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Partnership Schools allow for passionate and talented educators to engage with kids who would otherwise fail.&quot;<br>&quot;One such Partnership School is the South Auckland Middle School. It is the brainchild of Alwyn and Karen Poole, who run independent Mt Hobson Middle School in this electorate&quot; said Mr Seymour.<br>&quot;Under the Partnership School model, they have taken their model of education from Remuera to Manurewa so that more children can attend a good school. It is sad that the PPTA feels threatened by such initiatives.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We know that the children going to the five partnership schools are thrilled with the advantages they get from these schools. I believe every child should be able to access a good school, but currently New Zealand is failing its most vulnerable students.&quot; said Mr Seymour.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very proud of our achievements through Partnership Schools Kura Hourua said Mr Seymour, ACT Candidate for Epsom.<br>“I look forward to going to Wellington to expand the partnership program and give the opportunity to attend better schools to more New Zealanders” said Mr Seymour.</p>
