<p><strong>Traditional treatment nets supreme award for Sealord smoked salmon</strong></p>
<p>Sealord Group’s Hot Manuka Smoked Salmon received a resounding thumbs up from both the professional panel of judges and the consumer judging panel at this year’s New Zealand Food Awards.</p>
<p>The 2014 Supreme Award winner is smoked in West Auckland the traditional way, over manuka wood.</p>
<p>Judge Ray McVinnie says the winners he liked most this year were steeped in tradition, but with a modern twist.</p>
<p>“I was very impressed with the way the best things seem to set the trends, not follow them,&quot; Mr McVinnie says. &quot;My favourite was a very contemporary product that referenced a very traditional one. The best food products always have some connection to tradition – people who are completely familiar with the rules before they break them often seem to make the best food — food that isn’t reliant on additives, or being part of a superficial food fad.”</p>
<p>Massey University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says the calibre of entrants this year was very high. The university, New Zealand&#39;s leading food science innovation, teaching and research institution, hosts the annual awards in Auckland, and has been involved since their inception in 1987, taking over stewardship of the awards in 1998.</p>
<p>“Each of the winners in this year’s New Zealand Food Awards has taken a thoughtful approach with their winning products,&quot; Mr Maharey says. &quot;They reflect New Zealand’s innovative nature, and the ability to add value to our fantastic primary products. It’s no wonder New Zealand is seen internationally as world leaders in food innovation, safety and quality.”</p>

<p>In the battle of the Islands, awards were evenly split between the North and South Islands. Auckland-based companies just nudged out Christchurch with the highest number of winners, with five companies represented - Durello Traditional Brazillian Foods, Lion Dairy &amp; Drinks, Pure Delish, Genevieve’s and Tommy &amp; James. Christchurch’s A.Verkerk Limited, Original Foods and J. Friend and Co keeping the Garden City flag flying.</p>
<p>The Tasman Bay/Nelson region also stepped into the limelight this year, with Chia Limited and Tasman Bay Food Group both winning their respective categories. Sealord Group boasts offices in Auckland and Nelson, and could arguably be representing both regions. Wins by Wellington-based Bohemein Ltd and Dunedin-headquartered Alpine Origin Merino Ltd managed to keep the main centres represented.</p>
