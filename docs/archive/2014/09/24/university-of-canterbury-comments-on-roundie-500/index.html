<p><strong>University of Canterbury comments on Roundie 500</strong></p>
<p>The University of Canterbury strongly disapproves of the actions of a number of individuals involved in the recent ENSOC Roundie 500 event.</p>
<p>It is very clear that these students acted inappropriately and in a sexist and racist manner and provoked complaints to the University by other students.</p>
<p>The Roundie 500 event is an ENSOC event, not endorsed by the University Students Association nor the University.</p>
<p>Some of those involved exercised very poor judgment in relation to some of the themes and costumes. The University will investigate the complaints received as a priority.</p>
<p>The University expects a high standard of conduct of all its students and holds all students to account for their behaviour. It is concerned that students have made ill-informed decisions about the circulation of photographs on social media that would reflect poorly on them now and in the future.</p>
<p>The University will continue to work with UCSA to educate students as to appropriate behaviour in relation to such events.</p>
