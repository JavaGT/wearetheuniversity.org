<p><strong>Sunday, 14 September 2014, 4:19 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Left hits “peak spending”</p>
<p>The Labour Party have decided to go for broke and heap more spending commitments on the Left&#39;s spending pile in a vain bid to turn around their flagging polling numbers five days out from the election, National Party Associate Finance spokesman Steven Joyce says.</p>
<p>“Their latest ‘idea’ today to create a new ‘investment fund’ from the dividends of state-owned enterprises is just another way of pre-committing money that has already been committed by Labour a few times over,” Mr Joyce says.</p>
<p>&quot;Dividends received by the Government from state-owned enterprises are already being used to pay for public services like education and health and to pay down debt. They can&#39;t just keep being spent again and again. On top of that, the so-called ‘strategic investment’ language is quite obviously code for spending money on experimental cleantech investments that have lost money the world over.</p>
<p>“When you strip it back, what Labour have come up with today is simply another $400 million in pre-committed spending – no more and no less. That takes their four year commitment to $19 billion, before you add on the Greens plan to spend at least another $12 billion, and Dotcom&#39;s plan to spend tens of billions more.</p>
<p>“On top of that you have to add all the uncosted pledges of the Labour Party – to pay higher student support, to pay more to ACC claimants, to re-establish the &#39;dole for artists&#39; scheme, and so on.</p>
<p>“This approach would push up interest rates for households and businesses and stall the economy – as we saw under the previous government six years ago when floating home mortgages were almost 11 per cent at the economy flat-lined.</p>
<p>“The Left&#39;s appetite for looking like Father Christmas to the voting public has no limit.</p>
<p>“The only thing we can be absolutely sure of in regards to Labour, The Greens and Dotcom is that if they win next Saturday&#39;s election we would very quickly become a much poorer New Zealand.”</p>
