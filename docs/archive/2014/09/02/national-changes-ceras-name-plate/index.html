<p><strong>Tuesday, 2 September 2014, 1:06 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National changes CERA’s name plate  </p>
<p>National is admitting defeat with its Canterbury rebuild plans - now accepting Labour’s plan to wind back the role of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (Cera) but announcing nothing else to help Cantabrians, says Labour Leader David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“In July when Labour announced its intention to restore full local democracy to Christchurch and begin the wind-up programme for Cera, National called our policy a ‘fizzer’.</p>
<p>“The Government is tired and has run out of steam. It has no fresh ideas. Having sat on its hands over the Canterbury recovery and allowed the rebuild to slide, the Government is now forced to adopt Labour&#39;s progressive positive policies.</p>
<p>“Downgrading Cera on its own will do little to help Canterbury. Just changing the location of the organisation and putting a new name plate on a new door is not going to kickstart the rebuild. It will just mean more bureaucrats in Wellington. And it won&#39;t build one more house.</p>
<p>“The announcement raises several questions:</p>
<p>“Is the Government winding down its commitment to Canterbury?</p>
<p>“Can the Government guarantee local democratic representation for Cantabrians?</p>
<p>“Have these proposals been agreed with the Christchurch City Council?</p>
<p>“Labour has a comprehensive package of policies that will kickstart the Canterbury rebuild: these include building 10,000 affordable homes, creating an earthquake court to urgently settle outstanding claims, returning democratic elections to ECAN and investing in innovative transport solutions for Christchurch such as Labour&#39;s $100m plans for commuter rail announced yesterday,” says David Cunliffe.</p>
