<p><strong>Tuesday, 2 September 2014, 12:27 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Greens announce unemployment policy</p>
<p>A Labour/Greens coalition would mean less flexibility, fewer jobs, and more roadblocks for businesses wanting to invest and grow, National Party Labour Spokesman Simon Bridges said today.</p>
<p>“Labour and the Greens plans to increase the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour and then to $18 an hour would cost thousands and thousands of jobs, especially in small businesses and across regional New Zealand,” Mr Bridges says.</p>
<p>“They would scrap the starting-out wage which would mean young people would be given less opportunity to get a foot in the door and gain the essential experience they need.</p>
<p>“They would scrap National’s successful 90-day trial legislation which would cost thousands of jobs, despite research showing that a third of employers who used the trial period would not have hired a new employee without it.</p>
<p>“They would pay government employees at least the living wage which creates disparities between government and the private sector employees doing a similar job, and tax those same private sector employees more to make it happen.</p>
<p>“They would scrap the changes made to protect the screen industry in New Zealand which would effectively put thousands of jobs and our $3 billion screen industry at risk.</p>
<p>“If you want to make people unemployed, a Labour/Greens coalition is the best way to go about it.</p>
<p>“Unlike Labour and the Greens, National understands that flexibility, choice and fairness in the labour market are critical for supporting a stronger and more productive economy. It helps create jobs, increase wages and encourages innovation,” Mr Bridges says.</p>
