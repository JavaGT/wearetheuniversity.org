<p><strong>Thursday, 4 September 2014, 2:12 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hon Tony Ryall</strong></p>
<p><strong>National Party<br>Health Spokesman</strong></p>
<p>4 September 2014 <strong>Media Statement</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>High quality health services a priority for National</strong></p>
<p>New Zealanders are receiving better, sooner, more convenient healthcare as a result of National’s strong economic and fiscal management, and a re-elected National Government will continue to make health a priority.</p>
<p>During a visit to CentralMed Health in Tauranga today, Health Spokesman Tony Ryall said National’s health policies reinforce the Party’s commitment to providing New Zealanders with high quality public health services.</p>
<p>“Good health is hugely important to New Zealand families. A strong public health service gives families peace of mind – knowing that the care they need will be there, when they need it,” says Mr Ryall.</p>
<p>“One of the benefits of building a strong economy is that the Government is able to invest in maintaining and improving our public services including the health sector.</p>
<p>“Even during tight financial times which have seen many countries freeze or reduce their health services, National has protected and grown our health service with average increases of around $500 million a year.</p>
<p>“We’ve focused on areas that really matter to New Zealand families and we’re making real progress – thousands more people are getting hip, knee and other elective operations, cancer patients are receiving their treatment sooner and people are being seen in emergency departments faster than ever before.</p>

<p>“Health services all over the world face the challenge of a growing and ageing population. Our plan is about better preparing our health system for these challenges.</p>
<p>“National is investing strongly in primary care, screening, early intervention and disease prevention to keep New Zealanders healthy. And we’re supporting people with long-term conditions to live independently in the community.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders want a health service that delivers results, not endless strategies and reviews which Labour is promising.”</p>
