<p>Tricky David should tell the truth about insurance</p>
<p>National’s Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesman Gerry Brownlee says Labour must end its dishonesty over the number of people yet to get clarity over their earthquake insurance claims.</p>
<p>“It’s sad that someone claiming to be positive in this campaign is knowingly twisting figures to his perceived advantage – it’s called old fashioned negative campaigning,” Mr Brownlee says.</p>
<p>“Claims of anything like 10,000 Christchurch property owners in some sort of limbo are an outrageous exaggeration and Mr Cunliffe knows it.</p>
<p>“Settlement of an insurance claim only occurs when a repair or rebuild has been completed and the keys are handed over, or a cash offer has been accepted and the cheque has been banked.</p>
<p>“It’s a fact that most Cantabrians whose homes were damaged are well on track to resolution of their insurance issues.</p>
<p>“Out of 170,000 residential dwelling claims, around 900 people don’t yet have an offer from a private insurance company, and around 3500 people are working with EQC to get clarity on how and when their properties will be repaired.</p>
<p>“EQC will complete most repairs and settlements early next year, and private insurers have achieved over 90 per cent resolution of their claims.</p>
<p>“We would all like Canterbury’s earthquake insurance issues to be completely resolved, but the reality is the ground shook for almost two years after 4 September 2010, over 13,000 times.</p>
<p>“Serious repair and rebuild work could not begin until we had a sustained period without significant shaking, and settling insurance issues has been underway in earnest since that occurred.</p>

<p>“The reality of Canterbury’s insurance situation is a long way from the doom and gloom Labour is trying to paint.</p>
<p>“After a great deal of patience and hard work from homeowners and insurers, all of whom I salute for their efforts, we’re actually nearly there.</p>
<p>“Labour is not campaigning truthfully or positively in Canterbury, and they need to be called on it,” Mr Brownlee says.</p>
