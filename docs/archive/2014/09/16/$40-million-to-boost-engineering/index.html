<p><strong>Tuesday, 16 September 2014, 11:53 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>$40 million to boost engineering</p>
<p>A re-elected National-led government will allocate an additional $40 million to further boost engineering places and double the number of engineering graduates to at least match OECD averages, National Party Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment spokesman Steven Joyce says.</p>
<p>The announcement is part of National&#39;s commitment to increase the availability of skilled people and meet the skills needs of innovative New Zealand companies so they can grow and succeed on the world stage.</p>
<p>&quot;We have dramatically improved the performance of the whole tertiary education system by focusing on results rather than just enrolments,&quot; Mr Joyce says. &quot;Now is the time to bring the same unrelenting focus to supplying the skills that our innovative hi-tech companies need.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Joyce says the new engineering commitment will build on the Government&#39;s previous investment of $52 million over four years in Budgets 2012 and 2013 to lift the number of engineering graduates at level five and above from New Zealand institutions by 500 by 2017.</p>
<p>&quot;This new investment of $40 million over four years will support our target of doubling the number of engineering graduates from around 900 a year to 1,800 a year.</p>
<p>&quot;This latest engineering investment, plus the three new ICT graduate schools we announced in Budget 2014, will go a long way to lifting the supply of skilled graduates needed for our booming high-tech industries.&quot;</p>
<p>Other announcements included in National&#39;s Tertiary Education and Skills Policy released today include:</p>

<p>• Increasing the number of Maori and Pasifika trades training places from 3,000 a year to 5,000 a year at a cost of $30 million over four years to boost the numbers of young Maori and Pasifika in the construction trades and in the primary sector.<br>• Setting a new target for upskilling our younger workforce by having 60 per cent of 25-34 year olds achieving a degree or diploma qualification by 2017.<br>• Setting up three new ICT graduate schools in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch by mid-2015 at a cost of $28.6 million over four years.<br>• Setting up a new &#39;rate my qualification&#39; survey so that students and institutions can see how employers rate their qualifications in the workplace.</p>
<p>&quot;These announcements continue the implementation of National&#39;s clear tertiary education strategy which has six key priorities: delivering skills for industry, improving outcomes for at-risk young people, boosting achievement for Maori and Pasifika, lifting adult literacy and numeracy, strengthening our research institutions, and improving the international linkages of our tertiary sector.</p>
<p>&quot;A re-elected National-led government will have an unrelenting focus on delivering on that strategy for the benefit of New Zealand&#39;s economy and society.&quot;</p>
