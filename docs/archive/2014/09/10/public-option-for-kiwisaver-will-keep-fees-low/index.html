<p>Public option for KiwiSaver will keep fees low  </p>
<p>A public option for KiwiSaver will reduce fees, saving KiwiSavers tens of thousands of dollars over the lifetime of their investment, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>KiwiSaver research company Canstar released a report today showing KiwiSaver fees are rising faster than inflation. Canstar says a few dollars in fee savings can add up to a substantial difference over the life of an investment, and your retirement savings.</p>
<p>“The Green Party is going to add value to people’s KiwiSaver scheme by reducing the fees and costs they face,” Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman said today.<br>“We are going to do to superannuation, what Kiwibank has done for banking.”</p>
<p>“A public KiwiSaver option will intensify competition in the superannuation industry driving down costs.</p>
<p>“A significant part of KiwiSavers’ savings is being eaten away by high and rising costs and fees. By offering a public KiwiSaver option, we can lower costs saving tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>“If these savings are reinvested, KiwiSavers’ nest eggs will be significantly higher, up to $142,000 higher in some cases ($64,000 in today’s dollars).”</p>
<p>The recommendation for a single default provider was made by the Government’s own Savings Working Group. The Savings Working Group estimates that a single large provider can reduce the costs of KiwiSaver by a factor of two-to-three. A 40 percent saving in costs and fees over the lifetime of a typical KiwiSaver will result in a bigger nest egg on retirement of anywhere from $23,000 to $142,000.</p>

<p>“The public fund can achieve significant fee and cost reductions through greater economies of scale. The fund can be managed by the Guardians of the $26 billion New Zealand Superannuation Fund while Kiwibank or the Inland Revenue Department can provide the front-end management of individual KiwiSaver accounts,” Dr Norman said.</p>
<p>“Like Kiwibank, the public fund will be New Zealand owned, managed in an arm’s length, commercial way, in the interests of the New Zealand economy.”</p>
