<p>Tracey Martin MP<br>Spokesperson for Education</p>

<p><strong>Close Whangaruru Charter School Now</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First is calling on Minister of Education Hekia Parata to keep her word and close the Whangaruru partnership school now for the sake of its students.</p>
<p>“The Minister has stated in parliament again and again that these schools would be ‘more’ accountable than state schools because of the contracts they would have to sign,” says New Zealand First Deputy Leader and Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“The Whangaruru contract online shows that the school must have a minimum of 70 per cent registered teachers. However, the staff record that our offices have shows that only one of the nine staff has a current practicing certificate.”</p>
<p>“The school’s students are being short changed by the National Government – a government that continues to pretend that it cares for our challenged students.</p>
<p>“It has finally realized that Novopay might perform better in government hands, than in the private sector. When will it come to a similar conclusion about the education system – and shut down charter schools. It can start with Whangaruru.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First calls on the Minister to do this immediately and place the students with registered teaching staff so they can receive the education they deserve,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
