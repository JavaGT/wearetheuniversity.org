<p>Ruth Dyson<br>Canterbury Recovery Spokesperson</p>
<p>1 August 2014</p>
<p><strong>Plenty of options, asset sales not one of them</strong></p>
<p>Labour will vigorously oppose short term solutions to plug Christchurch City Council’s funding shortfall – including asset sales – which leave the city worse off financially and strategically in the long term, Labour’s Canterbury Recovery spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.</p>
<p>Responding to a report into the Christchurch City Council’s finances which raised a sell-off of some of the city’s assets as a possibility, Ruth Dyson said Labour MPs were committed to working towards real long term solutions for the city.</p>
<p>“The Cameron Partners’ report offers some new information into the financial challenges Christchurch is facing and provides a number of options to tackle them.</p>
<p>“Labour has already committed to reviewing the initial cost sharing arrangement negotiated by Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee and former Mayor Bob Parker.</p>
<p>“We now need to work together to discuss options for securing the long term financial stability of the Council. Consideration must be given to the priorities of residents, the timing of any commitments and sources of Council income.</p>
<p>“Labour MPs are committed to contributing to solutions which leave our city as a healthy and welcoming place where people want to live and visit. We know that a range of solutions will be on the table and more may come out of community discussions,” Ruth Dyson says.</p>
