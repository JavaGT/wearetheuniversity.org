<p><strong>Friday, 1 August 2014, 4:01 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party">The Maori Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Founding Māori Party Co-leaders give their total support to the new line-up</p>
<p>In an historic week for New Zealand politics, departing Māori Party founding leaders give their unreserved support to the new generation of Māori Party candidates.</p>
<p>“Absolutely outstanding” is how Tariana Turia and Dr Pita Sharples describe the Māori Party candidates contesting the seven Māori seats this election.</p>
<p>“The party’s future is in great hands. We have a dynamic and committed group of candidates who are ready to serve our people”, says Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“We have an incredibly dedicated group of candidates who understand, and embody the kaupapa of our party and the importance of maintaining an independent Māori voice in Government.”</p>
<p>“The Māori Party candidates broadly reflect who we are as a people”, says Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>“We have youth represented by Te Hira Paenga in Te Tai Tokerau and Marama Fox in Ikaroa Rāwhiti; we have experienced political thinkers such as our Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell in Waiariki and Chris McKenzie in Te Tai Hauāuru; astute entrepreneurs like Susan Cullen in Hauraki Waikato and Ngaire Button in Te Tai Tonga and people grounded in their communities like Rangi McLean in Tāmaki Makaurau.”</p>
<p>Mrs Turia says, “The last few weeks have been a watershed time for our party. Pita and I are committed to supporting our Party into the future, but it’s time that we stepped back and allowed the next generation of leaders to come through.</p>
<p>“Te Ururoa will steer our waka into the future. He is a great leader, a steady hand, and a much loved colleague to both of us. We know that our new team under his leadership has a huge amount to contribute to our people .”</p>
<p>ENDS.</p>
