<p><strong>Soloist opportunity for young violinist</strong></p>
<p>Second year music student Brigitte Balzat is the first violinist to win first prize at the annual Waikato University Concerto Competition final last Friday night.</p>
<p>The Hillary Scholar has been playing violin since the age of nine, and comes from an extremely musical family of nine, all of whom play an instrument.</p>
<p>Britta has secured herself a guest soloist spot with the Opus Orchestra on their September tour for winning the concerto competition.</p>
<p>“I’ve never played with an orchestra before so I’m really excited about it and looking forward to the opportunities it might bring,” she says.</p>
<p>Britta performed a Henri Vieuxtemps piece, concerto no. 5 in A major op.37, with her mother, Vivian Balzat accompanying her on the piano.</p>
<p>She is enrolled in a Bachelor of Music under the performance stream and is relishing her time at University with the music programme.</p>
<p>She says that one of the main reasons for choosing Waikato was the reputation of the music programme and the high calibre of staff here.</p>
<p>Five music students progressed through to the final after a preliminary competition. The four other finalists were: Jacky Siu (cello), Lauren Grout (flute), Alex Geary (violin) and Alex Swale (cello).</p>
<p>Lauren Grout was runner up on the night with her flute concert by Carl Nielsen.</p>
<p>The adjudicator for the night was Read Gainsfor, who has performed widely in the USA, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa as solo recitalist, concerto soloist and chamber musician.</p>
