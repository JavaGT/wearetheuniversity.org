<p>Parliament too soft on rural crime</p>
<p>“New Zealand needs to take stock theft seriously, If Parliament had extended ACT&#39;s successful 3 strikes for violent crime to protect farm animals the cruelty of rustling the Cornwall Park theft of sheep would never have happened” said Dr Jamie Whyte.</p>
<p>&quot;It takes rustling in a city park for the media to report what is a daily occurrence on our country&#39;s farms. Once National was the farmer&#39;s party and would have responded to the rapidly growing problem of stock theft. Today a National-lite government has adopted Labour&#39;s soft on crime approach and is more concerned about the welfare of the thieves.</p>
<p>Parliament needs to get a reality check. Rustling and burglary are increasing because they are crimes that pay. Organised stock thefts can earn rustlers hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>It is time we sent professional burglars and rustlers, often they do both crimes, to jail.</p>
<p>3 strikes has dramatically reduced violent crime and will do the same for the often cruel crime of rustling.&quot; Said ACT Leader Dr Jamie Whyte.</p>
