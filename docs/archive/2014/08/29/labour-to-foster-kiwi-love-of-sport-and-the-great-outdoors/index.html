<p><strong>Friday, 29 August 2014, 4:07 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour to foster Kiwi love of sport and the great outdoors</p>
<p>A Labour Government will promote physical activity, back our top athletes and help foster Kiwis’ love of the great outdoors by upgrading tramping and camping facilities.</p>
<p>Trevor Mallard today released Labour’s sports and recreation policy which will bring back a focus on physical activity.</p>
<p>“Physical activity is an essential part of a healthy lifestyle. We believe the Government can and should play a leadership role in encouraging people to be active because it not only brings personal benefits but saves health dollars at a national level.</p>
<p>“Labour will promote outdoor recreation by upgrading huts, tracks, camping grounds and other visitor facilities. We will also support new outdoor recreational activities such as walking and cycling trails.</p>
<p>“We will continue to invest in community sport to boost participation and help our local clubs thrive. And we will encourage more collaboration between club and school sport to help bridge the transition from primary to secondary school and onto tertiary education.</p>
<p>“Labour will look into school returning to early finishes on Wednesdays to facilitate mid-week sport. And we will work with regional sports trusts to share best practice and assist with training.</p>
<p>“We will also build on the Rugby World Cup volunteer base by giving those who help in the sport and recreation sector the chance to upskill.</p>
<p>“A Labour Government will also back our top athletes by increasing the focus on pre-elite athlete identification so our pool of high performance athletes can grow.</p>
<p>“Sport and recreation is an ingrained part of the Kiwi psyche. At the grassroots level it helps bind our communities and at the top level it lifts our national pride.</p>
<p>“Labour is committed to fostering a strong sport and recreation sector, and a healthy, active nation,” Trevor Mallard says.</p>
