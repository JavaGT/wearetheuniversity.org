<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader</p>

<p><strong>FONTERRA DEAL SIGNALS WARNING FOR FUTURE OF NZ DAIRYING</strong></p>
<p>Fonterra’s new deal with a Chinese infant food maker signals New Zealand may be losing control of its dairying future, says New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.<br>“Fonterra’s announcement of a joint venture with Beingmate two days ago was launched with the usual ballyhoo and unquestioned acclaim, but it has warning bells all over it,” he told a breakfast meeting of North Harbour Rotary today.</p>
<p>“Fonterra is doing the reverse of two large Chinese state companies, Mengniu-Yili (building a plant at Glenavy in South Canterbury) and Yashili (building a processing plant in Pokeno).</p>
<p>“The Chinese of course know what they are doing and for that they have my respect.</p>
<p>“Why doesn’t Fonterra add value to New Zealand raw material, create jobs in New Zealand, and establish New Zealand as the world-class centre for the development, production and marketing of world class Infant Formula to the world?</p>
<p>“Why are we allowing Chinese companies to enter New Zealand, mix/blend imported milk powder from their Chinese operations with New Zealand dairy powders and trade off Brand New Zealand back in China, claiming it’s made in New Zealand and is a product of New Zealand?</p>
<p>“Why are they using transfer pricing, and inter-company trading to undercut New Zealand-owned companies who are trying to trade and use the China-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement to our advantage, and opening the doors for Chinese companies to set up in New Zealand and use the FTA to China’s advantage.</p>

<p>“While Fonterra denied the China deal was linked to the botulism scare, the announcement came exactly a year after Fonterra and the government said the scare was a false alarm.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters pointed to the “worsening issue of sovereignty and market Brand New Zealand being determined by Chinese officials as to which industrial dairy plants they will recognise.</p>
<p>“In a few year’s time where dairying is concerned, it will not be in control of its own destiny.</p>
<p>“We will be developing raw-based material, sell it as a commodity at the lowest end of its value and be letting Chinese owned and controlled companies add value and earn valuable export earnings, which New Zealand companies should be earning.</p>
<p>“Where does NZTE, MFAT, and MPI stand while all this is going on?“</p>
