<p><strong><em>Address to the National Party Campaign Launch</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Vodafone Events Centre, Manukau</em></strong></p>
<p>Kia ora, and warm Pacific greetings to you all.</p>
<p>Thank you for your welcome.</p>
<p>It’s great to be with you today in Manukau.</p>
<p>Haven’t we seen some tremendous entertainment this afternoon?</p>
<p>It’s fantastic to see young people so full of life.</p>
<p>Doesn’t it feel great to be launching National’s election campaign here in the heartland of South Auckland?</p>
<p>We’re the party that’s working for New Zealand.</p>
<p>We’re the government that’s delivering results.</p>
<p>The economy’s growing.</p>
<p>Wages are rising.</p>
<p>Benefit numbers are dropping.</p>
<p>Crime rates are falling.</p>
<p>More elective surgery is being done in public hospitals.</p>
<p>And this year, after all we’ve been through as a country, I’m proud to say that the Government’s books will be back in the black.</p>
<p>On top of all that, my sense is that New Zealand has become a much more assured and more optimistic country.</p>
<p>A multicultural and more vibrant country – one that’s increasingly comfortable in its own skin.</p>
<p>I think back to 2008, when every month a net 3,000 people were leaving New Zealand for Australia.</p>
<p>Do you know what that figure was last month?</p>
<p>It was 80.</p>
<p>Rather than a stadium full of people leaving for Australia, it’s now more like a busload.</p>
<p>Because people know in their hearts and in their heads that New Zealand is moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>So the choice in this election is clear.</p>
<p>It’s between strong and stable leadership that’s delivering the benefits of a growing economy.</p>

<p>Or a group of parties that can’t agree with each other.</p>
<p>It’s between policies that are getting real results for New Zealand families.</p>
<p>Or a reversal of everything that’s working.</p>
<p>A choice between a government careful with your money.</p>
<p>Or parties whose election promises already add up to $28 billion and who want to tax you more to pay for them.</p>
<p>I know what I choose.</p>
<p>But I have to tell you that under MMP anything is possible.</p>
<p>Despite being low in the polls, it’s still possible for Labour to cobble together a government with the Greens, Dotcom and others, because that’s how the maths might work.</p>
<p>So everyone who wants National to lead the next government has to get out there on September 20 and party vote National.</p>
<p>They should have total confidence in doing that.</p>
<p>I lead a government that knows what it’s doing, and knows where it’s going.</p>
<p>I’m unashamedly positive for New Zealand.</p>
<p>I back New Zealanders to get ahead.</p>
<p>In the next 27 days I’m going to keep doing what I’ve done for the last six years – be relentlessly focused on what’s best for New Zealand.</p>
<p>I think we’ve got a great future ahead of us but we can take nothing for granted.</p>
<p>In 27 days from now, New Zealanders have the chance to lock in our plan for another three years.</p>
<p>In doing so, they’ll be voting for higher wages, more jobs and more growth.</p>
<p>Today is the official start of our campaign.</p>
<p>We’ve already announced some of our election policies.</p>
<p>These reinforce the approach we’ve always taken – supporting the most vulnerable, helping families, and staying tough on people who don’t follow the rules.</p>
<p>We’re cracking down on gangs that do so much harm.</p>
<p>We’ve set a target to reduce the crime rate even further.</p>
<p>We’ve released a policy I feel very strongly about, because it affects so many families at a difficult time.</p>
<p>We know the anguish people go through when their loved ones are in their final days and weeks – and we want to do our best to support them.</p>
<p>So we’ve made a commitment to increase funding for hospices by $20 million a year.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget – we’re the Party that funded the breast cancer drug Herceptin and, as a result, 1,100 women have got this treatment.</p>
<p>We’re also committing more to education.</p>
<p>We’re putting aside $350 million to build nine new schools in Auckland, with three earmarked for here in South Auckland.</p>
<p>Education is a huge focus for this government, and for me personally.</p>
<p>It’s the real opportunity we have to achieve generational change in the fortunes of New Zealand children and families.</p>
<p>We’re already seeing clear progress.</p>
<p>More kids are leaving school with at least NCEA Level 2, and I’m pleased to say the biggest lift in achievement has come from Pasifika students.</p>
<p>But we’re doing a lot more.</p>
<p>Earlier this year I announced a $359 million package of policies to do two things – to keep the best teachers in the classroom, and to get principals and teachers working together to raise student achievement across the board.</p>
<p>Because that’s what makes the biggest difference for our young people.</p>
<p>That, and getting them into work.</p>
<p>Under this government, the number of teenagers who are not working and not in education is heading towards a record low.</p>
<p>We’re working hard to expand the training opportunities available for young people, including Trades Academies and more apprenticeships.</p>
<p>Teen parents and other young beneficiaries now have a responsible adult alongside them.</p>
<p>That person makes sure they are in education or getting a job, have the support they’re often lacking from a parent, and are paying their bills.</p>
<p>And I can tell you that since 2009, the number of teen parents on a benefit has dropped by 40 per cent.</p>
<p>We’re going to announce more policies this election.</p>
<p>And you know from National that everything will be carefully considered and fiscally prudent.</p>
<p>Taken together, our policies won’t come anywhere near the big spending that Labour and the Greens have committed to.</p>
<p>I think New Zealanders can see that for what it is.</p>
<p>The country has yet to post a surplus but already our opponents are promising the earth to get elected.</p>
<p>They haven’t learnt from the past.</p>
<p>In its last five years, the previous Labour government increased its spending by 50 per cent.</p>
<p>The pressure this put on the economy helped drive mortgage rates up to almost 11 per cent.</p>
<p>That was tough for home owners.</p>
<p>But that’s not all.</p>
<p>Under the previous Labour government, house prices rose faster in New Zealand than in any other developed country.</p>
<p>In fact house prices doubled over Labour’s nine years.</p>
<p>No wonder home ownership is now more difficult for young Kiwis.</p>
<p>National values home ownership.</p>
<p>That’s because it provides stability for families, strength for communities and security in retirement.</p>
<p>So it’s important for young people to get their foot on the ladder, and into their first home.</p>
<p>We’ve been tackling this issue head on.</p>
<p>For a start, can I tell you that one of the best ways the Government can support more New Zealanders into home ownership is by helping to keep interest rates lower for longer.</p>
<p>We&#39;re doing that by carefully controlling our spending and sticking with sensible monetary policy.</p>
<p>We are also working to increase the amount of land available for new houses, and to get those houses built.</p>
<p>We’re setting up housing accords with local councils to free up more land.</p>
<p>We’ve already signed accords with Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington, Western Bay of Plenty and Tauranga.</p>
<p>And the latest figures show building activity up 16 per cent over just one quarter.</p>
<p>There are also other things the Government is doing to help people get into their own home.</p>
<p>So this is my announcement today – if we have the privilege of being re-elected, we will double government support for first home buyers, and over the next five years we’ll help 90,000 New Zealanders into their first home.</p>
<p>What’s more, we’ve carefully designed our policy to get more new homes built in an affordable price range – just like they used to be.</p>
<p>There are three sets of changes we’re going to make.</p>
<p>First, the existing KiwiSaver first home deposit subsidy will get overhauled and renamed HomeStart.</p>
<p>At the moment, first home buyers who’ve been in KiwiSaver for at least three years can get $1,000 towards their deposit for every year they’ve been a member, up to a maximum of $5,000.</p>
<p>That’s if their annual income is under a certain level, and they are buying a house under a certain price.</p>
<p>Under the new KiwiSaver HomeStart Grant a lot more people are going to become eligible for this help.</p>
<p>That’s because we’re going to raise the house price limits right across the country.</p>
<p>The existing limits simply don’t reflect the prices that first home buyers face when they’re trying to get into the market.</p>
<p>In Auckland, for example, the house price limit will be raised from $485,000 to $550,000.</p>
<p>Other areas with relatively high house prices – like Hamilton, Tauranga, the Wellington region, Nelson, Christchurch and Queenstown – will have a new threshold of $450,000.</p>
<p>And the threshold for the rest of the country will rise to $350,000.</p>
<p>Our changes mean an estimated 90,000 people will get a HomeStart Grant over the next five years – that’s 40,000 more than currently forecast.</p>
<p>For people buying an existing home, the maximum HomeStart Grant will continue to be $5,000 – or a total of $10,000 for a couple who are buying their first home together.</p>
<p>But we’re going to double that amount for those who are buying or building a brand new home.</p>
<p>People who are buying a <em>new</em> home will be eligible for a HomeStart Grant of up to $10,000 – or a total of $20,000 for a couple.</p>
<p>That’s for a very good reason.</p>
<p>We want housing companies to be building new houses and apartments that are more affordable.</p>
<p>It’s simple economics.</p>
<p>If housing companies know there are first home buyers with the ability and desire to purchase a new home, they’ll meet that demand.</p>
<p>So the number of new, affordable houses will increase – and that can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>The second change we’re going to make is to the KiwiSaver first home withdrawal scheme.</p>
<p>Currently, anyone who’s been in KiwiSaver for at least three years can withdraw money from their account to use as a deposit on a first home.</p>
<p>We’re going to let them take more out of their account, if they want to, so they can raise a bigger deposit.</p>
<p>First home buyers will now be allowed to withdraw the Government’s annual contribution to their account – up to $521 a year – as well as their own contributions.</p>
<p>That will make quite a difference, because every bit helps when you’re building a deposit.</p>
<p>The final change we’re introducing is to the Welcome Home Loans scheme, which allows many first home buyers to get a government-guaranteed loan with a ten per cent deposit.</p>
<p>Again, their income has to be under a certain level, and they have to be buying a house under a certain price.</p>
<p>We’re going to make those criteria the same as for the HomeStart Grant.</p>
<p>That means a lot more first home buyers will be able to get a loan from the bank – backed by the government – to buy their first home with a ten per cent deposit.</p>
<p>Let me put this all together for you with an example.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine a couple are both earning $40,000 a year – they might, for example, be living here in South Auckland.</p>
<p>They’ve been in KiwiSaver for five years, and are looking to buy a first home that’s under the price limit.</p>
<p>Under our changes, they could together withdraw up to $29,000 from their KiwiSaver accounts, and get either a $10,000 or $20,000 HomeStart Grant, depending on whether they’re buying an existing or a new home.</p>
<p>In total, that means a deposit after five years of almost $40,000 – or almost $50,000 if they are buying new.</p>
<p>That would be enough on its own to get a Welcome Home Loan for a house costing up to $400,000 or up to $500,000 if new – depending, of course, on their ability to service the mortgage.</p>
<p>Our changes will give a lot more people the confidence that if they join KiwiSaver, and keep saving, they can put together a deposit on their first house.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that most of that deposit will be their own savings.</p>
<p>We want to help people into their first home, but they have to help themselves first.</p>
<p>All these changes I’m announcing today will take effect from 1 April next year, if we are re-elected.</p>
<p>Not too long after that, the first people to benefit from these changes will be unlocking the front door of their own home for the first time.</p>
<p>The new policy will cost $218 million over the next five years.</p>
<p>That means we’re doubling the current programme, to help thousands more people every year to own their own homes.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>New Zealanders have a clear choice this election.</p>
<p>They can stay with the party that’s working hard and providing strong, stable government with a clear and positive direction for New Zealand.</p>
<p>Or they can choose one of the opposition parties, knowing that if they pick one, they’ll get two or three more thrown in.</p>
<p>I think New Zealanders are aspirational for their future.</p>
<p>I think they value the opportunities, growth, stability and fairness that a National government brings.</p>
<p>So every day for the next 27 days – alongside National’s excellent MPs and candidates – I will be out there working hard to let New Zealanders know about our plan.</p>
<p>That plan is working for New Zealand.</p>
<p>It’s working for more jobs, higher pay, safer streets, healthier kids, higher achievement, and more investment under our stable, proven leadership.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, join me in talking to New Zealanders about National’s plan.</p>
<p>Let’s get out there and make our voice heard.</p>
<p>Let’s campaign hard.</p>
<p>Let’s party vote National.</p>
<p>ends  </p>
