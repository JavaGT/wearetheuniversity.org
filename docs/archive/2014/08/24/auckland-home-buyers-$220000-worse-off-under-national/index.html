<p><strong>Sunday, 24 August 2014, 3:25 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Auckland home buyers now only $220,000 worse off under National  </p>
<p>New home buyers in Auckland are on average $228,400 worse off when buying a home now than when National came to power, and National’s meek deposit policy does nothing to make housing more affordable says the Green Party.</p>
<p>“Since National came to power in 2008 the median house price in Auckland has risen by $228,400. Today’s announcement is a meek band aid solution to a much more serious problem,” said Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman.</p>
<p>“National chucking a few dollars at deposits does almost nothing to offset the massive increase in the average house price under their watch.</p>
<p>“While first home buyers will no doubt welcome any additional support, the reality is that it is a drop in the bucket. First home buyers will still be over $220,000 behind where they were in 2008 due to average price increases</p>
<p>“The only real difference to the current KiwiSaver policy is some home buyers will get up to $5000 more for a mortgage to buy an expensive new home. That extra subsidy doesn’t even touch the sides of offsetting the $228,400 increase in the median house price in Auckland.</p>
<p>“A few thousand dollars more for a deposit doesn’t address the much bigger issues of mortgage servicing and the lack of supply of genuinely affordable houses.</p>
<p>“This policy is underwhelming. If you are ineligible for the Home Start grant, all National is offering you is a few hundred dollars more a year, of your own savings, to go towards a deposit on increasingly expensive houses.</p>

<p>“National’s announcement does nothing to actually make houses more affordable or increase the supply of affordable homes.</p>
<p>“In Government, the Green Party will take real steps to assist with home affordability. We will introduce a capital gains tax (excluding the family home) and place restrictions on foreign investors to dampen housing speculation.</p>
<p>“We will increase the supply of affordable house by undertaking a programme of state building affordable houses and state houses.</p>
<p>“Our Progressive Ownership policy will allow low income families to &#39;rent-to-own&#39; government-built houses at an affordable price.</p>
<p>“The Green’s policy addresses the real drivers of housing affordability and will deliver for those New Zealanders who have been priced out of the market under National.”</p>
