<p>National applies band-aid to housing crisis</p>
<p>The Government’s flagship housing announcement is a band-aid approach that will push up prices rather than solve the housing crisis, says Labour Leader David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“House sales to first home buyers have collapsed as a direct result of the Government’s failed housing policies, and now they are offering up a sticking plaster.</p>
<p>“If this is the best they can come up with after six years of denial and delay, they don’t deserve to be in government.</p>
<p>“They refuse to actually build the many thousands of extra houses that are needed. And they refuse to tax speculators.</p>
<p>“All they are offering is some help with a deposit for a few thousand extra home buyers, and letting people borrow their own retirement savings, when tens of thousands of Kiwi families are afflicted by the housing crisis.</p>
<p>“That will not even offset the higher deposit requirements under this government’s loan to value ratios (LVRs).</p>
<p>“The fundamental problems are lack of supply of housing, planning rules that constrict development, and unrestricted speculation.</p>
<p>“Unmet demand is driving house prices through the roof, and instead of addressing the fundamental problem now National wants to spend $218 million of taxpayers’ money to fuel demand even more. It will drive prices even higher.</p>
<p>“Labour will fix the housing crisis by building 100,000 affordable homes for first home buyers. Labour will also remove the current tax preference for speculators, and issue a National Policy Statement under the RMA directing Councils to increase the supply of new housing,” said David Cunliffe.</p>
