<p><strong>Sunday, 24 August 2014, 8:17 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Plan to help thousands of first home buyers get a deposit</p>
<p>National values home ownership because it provides stability for families, strength for communities, and security in retirement.</p>
<p>This afternoon I had the privilege of launching National’s 2014 election campaign in Manukau and announcing our plan to help thousands of lower and middle income first home buyers get into a home of their own.</p>
<p>The changes to KiwiSaver I announced today will help about 90,000 lower and middle income first home buyers over the next five years – 40,000 more than would be helped under current policies.</p>
<p>The three major changes are:</p>
<p>• Replacing the KiwiSaver first home deposit subsidy with a KiwiSaver HomeStart Grant, doubling the support for buying a new home and increasing the house price limits;</p>
<p>• Enabling larger KiwiSaver First Home Withdrawals by including the member’s tax credit, meaning first home buyers will now be able to withdraw all of their KiwiSaver savings except the $1000 kick-start;</p>
<p>• Expanding eligibility for Welcome Home Loans by aligning the house price caps with the new KiwiSaver HomeStart Grant.</p>
<p>National values home ownership because it provides stability for families, strength for communities, and security in retirement.</p>
