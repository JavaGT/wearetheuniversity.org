<p><strong>Sunday, 24 August 2014, 1:53 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Delivering better housing for New Zealanders</p>
<p>National will continue its programme of reform to the housing sector to increase the number of new affordable homes and ensure fit-for-purpose social housing for New Zealanders most in need, National Party’s Housing Spokesman Dr Nick Smith says.</p>
<p>“We have been working hard over the past three years to address New Zealand’s housing challenge,” Dr Smith says.</p>
<p>“We are speeding up consent processes and increasing land supply through our Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas legislation, with agreements reached with five councils to date. We have removed tariffs and duties on building products to reduce costs through increased competition.</p>
<p>“We are reining in what infrastructure local councils can charge residential developers through development contributions. We are investing heavily in building industry skills and boosting productivity in the sector. We are carefully managing the economy to keep interest rates lower for longer.</p>
<p>“We announced today an expansion of support for first home buyers with KiwiSaver HomeStart. This package of assistance for first home buyers will help tens of thousands more New Zealanders achieve the dream of owning their own home.</p>
<p>“It is the combination of all these measures that will deliver lasting results.</p>
<p>“National is in the process of overseeing a major shift from state housing to social housing this term. In the next term, we will build on the our innovative approach we have taken to deliver housing that better meets the needs of people most in need for as long as they are in need.</p>

<p>“We have integrated needs assessments with the Government’s wider social support services, extended income-related rent subsidies to community housing providers and introduced reviewable tenancies. Our aim is to grow a more diverse social housing sector.</p>
<p>“National will continue our good record in improving housing affordability and helping those most in need.”</p>
