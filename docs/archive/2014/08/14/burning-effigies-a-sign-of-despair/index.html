<p>Burning Effigies a sign of despair. The left needs to re-think</p>
<p>This campaign is bitter. People are burning effigies of the Prime Minister, holding Nuremberg-type rallies and destroying billboards.</p>
<p>But why is it bitter?</p>
<p>There are two common reasons for bitterness in disputes. One is genuine and passionate disagreement. Although that often engenders mutual respect, it also often creates hostility.</p>
<p>That cannot be the cause of the heat in this election campaign. Rarely have we had such a National-lite government.</p>
<p>This National government has happily accepted the agenda of the previous Labour party government. They are content to sustain Working for Families, Interest Free Student loans, and race-based legal privilege. They have actually increased government spending, even beyond Helen Clark’s massive increases between 2005 and 2008.</p>
<p>There is little in this National government for a left wing supporter of Helen Clark’s government to object to.</p>
<p>The real reason for all the heat and fury is the fact that National’s strategy has been electorally brilliant. By moving to the left, they have given their left-wing opponent’s nowhere to go, except the fringes of nutty policy and personal vindictiveness.</p>
<p>John Key has succeeded by becoming National-lite in the same way that Clark succeeded by becoming Labour-lite.</p>
<p>That is why the only serious opponent of the National Party, oddly enough, is ACT.</p>
<p>Of course, ACT will enter a confidence and supply agreement with National, at a minimum. Maintaining John Key as the Prime Minister is by far the most important immediate outcome of this election. The alternative is unthinkable.</p>

<p>But the electorally advantageous moves National has made are not in the long-term interests of New Zealand. Electoral success is not always promoted by the best policies. Often it is promoted by pandering to common misconceptions and a bias in favour of the status quo.</p>
<p>National-lite has not much improved public policy in New Zealand. We are still over-regulated and over-taxed. And, on account of that, we are still underperforming relative to our potential.</p>
<p>ACT can make that argument.</p>
<p>But Labour, the Greens, NZ First, the Conservatives and Internet-Mana cannot. They are all committed to doing even more of what National has got wrong. More regulation, more taxes, more unsustainable government spending and more corporate welfare.</p>
<p>How can they seriously criticise National? They basically agree with their direction. All they can do is promote xenophobia, make obscene chants and deface billboards.</p>
<p>National’s move to the left has pushed these parties into looney-land.</p>
<p>ACT is the only serious alternative for people who know that public policy in New Zealand can be improved.</p>
<p>ends</p>
