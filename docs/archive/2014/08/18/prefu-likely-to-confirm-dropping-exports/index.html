<p>PREFU likely to confirm dropping exports</p>
<p>National’s economic management will be put under the spotlight in tomorrow’s PREFU given clear signs the so-called rock star economy has fallen off the stage, with plummeting prices for raw commodity exports, Labour’s Finance spokesperson David Parker says.</p>
<p>“Under National, New Zealand has become ever more reliant on raw commodities such as milk and logs while non-primary manufacturing exports and other industries struggle.</p>
<p>“Overall exports have fallen from 33 per cent of GDP to 29 per cent of GDP under National, a far cry from their promise of increasing exports to 40 per cent of GDP.</p>
<p>“Analysts will be checking tomorrow&#39;s Treasury forecasts to see how much further exports are now predicted to fall.</p>
<p>“John Key and Bill English can&#39;t blame the GFC or the Canterbury earthquakes for taking New Zealand backwards in exports as a proportion of our economy. It is their mismanagement that is to blame.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile too much capital continues to go into housing speculation rather than productive investment. We will never get rich selling houses and farms to each other or to foreigners.</p>
<p>“John Key and Bill English will produce yet another projection that has them limping back into surplus for the first time in six years, compared to Labour’s nine surpluses in a row.</p>
<p>“When re-elected, Labour will continue where we left off - running surpluses - because sound fiscal management is important. But good economic management is about more than fiscal management.</p>
<p>“Our Economic Upgrade plan will diversify our economy and boost exports through a focus on investment, innovation and industry. We will increase investment through universal KiwiSaver and use a capital gains tax (excluding the family home) to direct it to productive businesses and jobs.</p>
<p>“We will boost innovation through research and development tax credits and tax incentives to encourage investment in new technology.</p>
<p>“We will support crucial industries through upgrade plans for sectors such as forestry, manufacturing and ICT.</p>
<p>&quot;The choice this election on economic management is clear. More of the same or a much-needed upgrade,” David Parker says.</p>
