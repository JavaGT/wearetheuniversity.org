<p>5th August 2014</p>
<p><strong>Students give free transport plan a green light</strong></p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) President Sonya Clark welcomed the release of the Green Party’s Student Transport policy today, saying it is “a leap forward in addressing the cost of transport for tertiary students.”</p>
<p>The Green Party released their Green Card policy today, which would grant all tertiary students and apprentices in New Zealand free off-peak travel on buses, trains and ferries, through a ‘Student Green Card’.</p>
<p>Clark welcomed the move, stating, “This is a long overdue provision that recognises the importance of access to higher education for our communities and economy and begins to address the financial hardship of tertiary students.”</p>
<p>“Students are the only group in society expected to borrow in order to meet their living costs. Transport makes up a huge part of living costs and making it more affordable goes a long way to help students struggling to make ends meet.”</p>
<p>Welfare Vice President Rick Zwaan said, “VUWSA has been campaigning for Fairer Fares on public transport in Wellington for several years so it’s great to see politicians listening to students and responding with policy.”</p>
<p>“We would like it to go further and provide for on-peak travel as well, as students don’t get to choose when they have lectures. This proposal in its current form would still create barriers for students who have class early in the morning. A third of students at Vic travel during peak time so we need concessions for them too.”</p>
<p>“Now we just need more parties to come on board to make it a reality.”</p>
<p>“This is an issue which requires cross-party support, and we look forward to seeing that happen this election” concludes Zwaan.</p>
