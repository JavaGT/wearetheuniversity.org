<p>University to be new home of large NZ sculpture</p>
<p>August 5, 2014</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury will soon be the new home of a large sculpture of national significance which was once displayed in the centre of Christchurch and then held in Blenheim for more than 15 years.</p>
<p>Andrew Drummond, one of New Zealand’s most important senior artists, created the work which was purchased by the ANZ Bank in May 1995 and was originally displayed in their Hereford Street Branch in Christchurch. It was eventually transferred to Blenheim in January 1999 where it has been ever since.</p>
<p>The ANZ Bank has donated the Drummond piece, Energy Device, to the University of Canterbury which will be displayed on campus in the James Hight building.</p>
<p>Drummond was senior lecturer in sculpture at the university and his works are held in every major public collection in New Zealand. His piece Energy Device was made in 1995 and its main components are two branches of European beech joined in a twisted copper cone filled with wax.</p>
<p>University of Canterbury arts collection curator Jamie Hanton says five Drummond pieces are already held at the university and the latest addition strengthens the collection.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re grateful to have been chosen by the ANZ Bank to be the proud new home of this piece. Adding this piece reflects a period of time where Drummond was in a position to greatly influence to a generation of sculpture students as a lecturer at the university’s Ilam School of Fine Arts. This work has value as a teaching resource in relation to New Zealand’s environmental history,’’ Hanton says.</p>

<p>Professor Paul Millar, Head of the School of Humanities and Creative Arts, welcomed that latest acquisition to the university’s arts collection.</p>
<p>``It’s great to display this sculpture as a tangible reminder of one of the many great New Zealand artists that have been associated with the University of Canterbury School of Fine Arts over the years, on whom the school’s reputation is founded,’’ Professor Millar says.</p>
