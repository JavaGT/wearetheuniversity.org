<p>Another kick in the guts to Canterbury from National associate</p>
<p>John Key is failing to stand up for Cantabrians as another high-profile National associate kicks Cantabrians in the guts, Labour’s EQC spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove says.</p>
<p>“John Ansell, the advertising man behind National’s controversial 2005 campaign, said this morning that: ‘God is obviously a member of the National Party where [sic] as he um flattened the people’s republic of Christchurch and that created the economic growth that the Nats are now boasting about.’ ([<a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/audio/player/20146529%20from%203:10%5D">http://www.radionz.co.nz/audio/player/20146529%20from%203:10]</a>(<a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/audio/player/20146529">http://www.radionz.co.nz/audio/player/20146529</a> from
3:10))</p>
<p>“That is absolutely disgraceful and hurtful to all those Cantabrians who have been toughing it out for the last four years.</p>
<p>“This comes on top of Cameron Slater calling earthquake victims ‘scum’. What have Cantabrians done to deserve these attacks?</p>
<p>“The challenge for the Prime Minister is to show leadership and condemn Mr Ansell’s comments and those of Mr Slater, however so far his silence is deafening.</p>
<p>“Mr Key may claim Mr Ansell doesn’t have direct links to the National Party anymore, as he does with Mr Slater, but that’s not good enough. John Key must show leadership and condemn the comments. That’s what New Zealanders expect from a Prime Minister,” says Clayton Cosgrove.</p>
