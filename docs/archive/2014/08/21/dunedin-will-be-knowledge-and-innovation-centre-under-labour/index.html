<p>David<br>CUNLIFFE</p>
<p>Labour Leader</p>
<p>21 August 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Dunedin will be a knowledge and innovation centre under Labour</strong></p>
<p>Dunedin will become a knowledge and innovation centre under a Labour Government that will back local businesses, support technology initiatives and fund dynamic regional projects, Labour Leader David Cunliffe says.</p>
<p>“Nowhere has the National Government’s short-sightedness been more apparently than in its decision to gut Invermay. AgResearch’s facility provides invaluable contribution to the productivity of our livestock farmers.</p>
<p>“Labour will keep Invermay open as a fully functioning agricultural science research centre. We will continue to back Invermay both as a productivity driver for our agricultural sector and the heart of cutting edge science in Otago.</p>
<p>“Labour will also support innovation and technology initiatives such as the Start Up space which I am visiting today.</p>
<p>“A Labour Government will create 3000 more jobs in Otago by the end of our first term through our Economic Upgrades for forestry, manufacturing, fisheries, information technology and small businesses.</p>
<p>“And local projects such as reopening and upgrading parts of the Hillside workshop will be able to access funding through our $200 million Regional Development Fund, aimed at supporting local projects which provide an economic step-change for their regions.</p>
<p>“Labour will also reverse years of neglect by the National Government which has allowed the Dunedin Hospital deteriorate to such an extent that operations have had to be cancelled.</p>

<p>We will invest at least $250 million into a rebuild which will begin in our first term.</p>
<p>“And our health policy will make it easier for Otago’s 32,000 over 65-year-olds and 30,000 kids under 13 to stay healthy though free GP visits and prescriptions. Pregnant women and low-income earners will also benefit.</p>
<p>“A Labour Government will help Dunedin become one of our best and brightest cities,” David Cunliffe says.</p>
