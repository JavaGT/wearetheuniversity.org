<p>Huge Number of Immigrants Puts Pressure on</p>
<p>New Zealand cannot deal with almost 800 people settling here every week - it is just not common sense, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“The government should hang its head in shame over today’s immigration figures with 140,000 Kiwis out of work and a housing crisis in Auckland,” says New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“The pressure on housing, jobs, our hospitals, schools and our welfare system from a near record 41,000 people settling here in the past year is unbearable and will squeeze these services for hardworking New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“This increase is related 67,984 work visas (up 3100) and nearly 90,000 student visas (up 4800) making the plight of Kiwi job seekers even worse.</p>
<p>“When the National government gave foreign students work rights they increased job competition and allowed ‘study” to be used as a means to permanent residency.</p>
<p>“Where is the export education policy now when it is our economy that is paying for foreign students to work here?</p>
<p>“The government is not monitoring immigration at all – it has an open door policy and its contributing to the fastest rate of population growth for over a decade.</p>
<p>“This is all about the economy trying to progress on the basis of consumerism and production.</p>
<p>“All the hype about a rock star economy was largely about the consumptive growth that goes with an increasing population</p>
<p>“There has been no real expansion in health, education and infrastructure to match this rapid population increase - belatedly the government has talked about building new schools just as the election campaign begins.</p>
<p>“No thought or planning has been given to the potential social and cultural consequences of this massive influx</p>
<p>“National’s irresponsible, unfocused immigration policy has taken no account of either the quantity or quality of immigrants – and New Zealanders, old and new, will pay a heavy price for this,” Mr Peters says.</p>
