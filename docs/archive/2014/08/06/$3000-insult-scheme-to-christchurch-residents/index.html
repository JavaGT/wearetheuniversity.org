<p><strong>Wednesday, 6 August 2014, 1:00 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>$3000 Insult Scheme to Christchurch Residents</p>
<p>The investigation of beneficiaries who took cash to work in Christchurch but did not show up to their jobs comes as no surprise to New Zealand First, says Spokesperson for Social Policy/Welfare Asenati Lole-Taylor.</p>
<p>“Social Development Minister Paula Bennett’s claims that the $3000 to Christchurch scheme was a win-win for beneficiaries and the Canterbury region has proven to be completely false,” says Mrs Lole-Taylor.</p>
<p>“This clumsy policy is becoming a burden to taxpayers, Christchurch employers and the beneficiaries themselves.</p>
<p>“Communities in Christchurch have told me that this scheme is an insult to them because bringing people from other parts of the country depicts local residents as unwilling or incapable of doing the work themselves.</p>
<p>“We would not have this mess if the Government had focussed on generating employment for the 16,000 people who already do not have a job in Christchurch.</p>
<p>“It is a reflection of policy failure that the Government is recruiting from other parts of the country and overseas for the Christchurch rebuild.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First believes in giving priority of jobs to the people of Christchurch.</p>
<p>“The Christchurch economy can and should be strengthened through its local workers,” says Mrs Lole-Taylor.</p>
