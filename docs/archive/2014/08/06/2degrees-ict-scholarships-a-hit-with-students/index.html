<p><strong>2degrees ICT Scholarships a hit with students</strong></p>
<p>Four University of Waikato students are the recipients of 2degrees ICT Scholarships worth $5000 each.</p>
<p>Christopher Beckham and Matti Thorley-Symes (Bachelor of Computing and Mathematical Sciences), and Alena Choong and Steven Crake (Bachelor of Engineering (Hons)) were presented with their scholarship certificates on July 24 at a morning tea at the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Operations) Anna Bounds said the 2degrees scholarships were a “great outcome that has come from a consistent period of good collaboration, hard work and attention to detail between the University of Waikato and 2degrees”.</p>
<p>“It’s not just about the University having a mobile phone contract with 2degrees. It’s about them investing in our young people, who are the workforce of the future and could potentially be employed by 2degrees.</p>
<p>“This is a great example of how vendors and service providers are building capability in New Zealand’s workforce. This is the first time these scholarships have been offered and there’s been a great deal of support for the partnership, from staff, alumni and students.”</p>
<p>2degrees Chief Sales Officer Scott Taylor says the ICT scholarships are just the start, and hopes to look at more scholarships, internships and joint research opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a fantastic partnership with the University. In our business we’re very reliant on ICT (Information and Communications Technology) services and this is a great opportunity to support up-and-coming students in this field. We’re very proud to be able to support them.”</p>
<p>The students were all very appreciative of their scholarships.</p>
<p>“We’re so stoked,” says Matti. “This really helps us with our study costs so we can just concentrate on our study. We’re all incredibly grateful to 2degrees. It’s really cool that they’ve created these scholarships to support students.”</p>
<p>In March 2013, 2degrees won a contract to provide all mobile voice and data services to the University, providing mobile services to over 450 connections, as part of a long-term partnership. This enables students to utilise the latest technology and learn anywhere, anytime.</p>
