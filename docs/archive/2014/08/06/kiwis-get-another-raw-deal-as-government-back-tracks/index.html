<p>Kiwis get another raw deal as Government back tracks on ACC levies</p>
<p>National is pinching money from the back pockets of Kiwis, taking cash it doesn’t need through ACC levies to create the illusion of a surplus, Labour’s ACC spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway says.</p>
<p>“The Government has ignored the Accident Compensation Corporation&#39;s recommendation that levies on Kiwi workers and businesses be cut by $658 million next year, instead cutting them by a lesser $480 million as indicated at the Budget.</p>
<p>“ACC levies cannot be used for any other purpose. National is over-taxing every New Zealand worker and the money will just sit in the bank doing nothing.</p>
<p>“That’s an incredible abuse of the Government’s power to demand revenue from its citizens.</p>
<p>“The vehicle safety rating system is nothing more than a tax on people who can’t afford flash cars. A levy reduction of a few hundred dollars is not going to inspire anyone juggling the cost of weekly bills to go out and spend thousands on a new car.</p>
<p>“Labour will make sure ACC provides fair treatment and fair compensation in return for a fair levy,” Iain Lees-Galloway said.</p>
