<p><strong>Sunday, 31 August 2014, 11:17 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National&#39;s dirty politics hurts everyday New Zealanders</p>
<p>National&#39;s alleged involvement in dirty politics makes it appear that the Government is looking out for its mates instead of everyday New Zealanders, the Green Party believes, after new allegations that one of John Key&#39;s senior Ministers may have been aware of attempts to undermine the Serious Fraud Office&#39;s investigations into finance company collapses.</p>
<p>&quot;The tens of thousands of New Zealanders who lost their savings in the finance company collapses will be shocked at allegations that one of John Key&#39;s senior Ministers was &quot;gunning&quot; for the head of the Serious Fraud Office who were holding those companies to account,&quot; said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>&quot;John Key&#39;s government should have been 100 percent focused on justice for the everyday New Zealanders who lost out in the finance company collapse.</p>
<p>&quot;If the allegations are true, any attempt to undermine the SFO investigations would appear to be an example of National backing their mates over the everyday New Zealanders who lost out in the finance company collapses.</p>
<p>&quot;If the allegations prove true, it would indicate that there is one rule for the National Party and their friends and another for everyday New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;It is essential for our democracy and economy that the Government provides a level playing field for all and upholds the law in the same way for all.</p>
<p>&quot;Backing winners and giving preferential treatment to individuals, if ture, erodes our democracy and business confidence.</p>

<p>&quot;The Greens will clean up politics by holding a Royal Commission of inquiry into all of the allegations of National&#39;s dirty politics in order to restore the public’s faith in a fair and even handed Government that treats all people and businesses fairly.</p>
<p>&quot;We will ask the Royal Commission to provide advice on new rules to strengthen our democracy so future Government&#39;s can&#39;t engage in the dirty politics we have seen under National.</p>
<p>&quot;The only way to clean up politics is to change the Government. A new Government with the Greens in it will commit to a Royal Commission and commit to cleaning up our political system that National has eroded.&quot;</p>
