<p>Labour: Promoting sustainable tourism</p>
<p>Ensuring New Zealand’s clean, green status continues to be an international tourism benchmark and reviewing MBIE’s oversight of the tourism sector will be on the radar under a Labour Government.</p>
<p>Releasing Labour’s Tourism policy today, spokesperson Darien Fenton said tourism was vital to New Zealand’s economy and protecting and promoting its 100% pure brand was essential.</p>
<p>“For every dollar spent in key international markets our economy benefits tenfold, which is why funding marketing campaigns to attract overseas visitors is so important.</p>
<p>“That means walking the talk and ensuring the country is the clean, green destination we promote it to be through sound policies in overlapping areas.</p>
<p>“It also means the sector must have top level recognition and support from government, something that has been lacking since oversight of tourism was passed to the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment.</p>
<p>“Labour will look at how well MBIE is actually serving our tourism industry and work with stakeholders to ensure their needs are being met, and we’ll collaborate with the industry to implement the Tourism 2025 strategy.</p>
<p>“Domestic tourism won’t be neglected. A Labour Government will create career pathways and decent work, including certified labour standards, to build a sustainable tourism career stream for New Zealanders wanting to work in the industry.</p>
<p>“We will also:<br>Continue to support tourism-focused research so that New Zealand remains a global leader in policy development<br>Streamline compliance costs and move towards a ‘one-stop shop’ approach for inspections<br>Ensure there are pathways for students into the tourism industry through high-quality, focused and relevant training programmes  </p>
<p>“A tourism industry that is environmentally, economically, culturally and socially sustainable will be strengthened under a Labour Government,” Darien Fenton said.</p>
