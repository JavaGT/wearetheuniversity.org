<p>Young Māori boost annual job figures</p>
<p>The Māori Party welcomes the news that more than 15,000 more Māori were employed in the last year and well over half of these workers are rangatahi. The Household Labour Force survey results recently released shows 10,000 more Māori youth (15 – 24 years old) have been employed in the last year.</p>
<p>“The employment inequities between Māori and non-Māori are still unacceptable but it’s encouraging to see a significant rise in the number of young Māori in paid work. The statistics are going in the right direction,” says Māori Party Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell.</p>
<p>“Over the last six years in Government, the Māori Party has made jobs and training a key priority. We’ve set a foundation to build on from the success of Community Max, Māori Affairs cadetships, the He Toki ki te Rika Trade Training programme and the additional investment of 3000 places through Māori and Pasifika Trades Training. These initiatives have also contributed to the steady changes we need to be making in our communities - creating real jobs to put food on the table, and creating a better future for whānau.</p>
<p>“The Māori unemployment rate has also dropped to 11 percent (down from 12.8 percent last year) - the lowest it’s been for seven years. We recognise there’s a long way to go but we’re confident that by expanding the Māori and Pacific Trades Training Scheme as well as looking at creative partnerships between iwi, tertiary providers and industry we can continue to grow the number of Māori in paid employment,” says Mr Flavell.</p>
