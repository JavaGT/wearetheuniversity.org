<p>ACT Leader Dr Jamie Whyte</p>
<p>11 August 2014</p>
<p><strong>Politics is an advance auction sale of stolen goods?</strong></p>
<p>The American journalist, H L Menken said that all election campaigns soon become an “advance auction sale of stolen goods”.</p>
<p>As John Armstrong noted in his Herald column today, this election is no exception. All the parties of the left are busily trying to buy votes with taxpayers’ money. The Greens are the worst. Labour isn’t too far behind. Even National has promised $1.5 billion of extra annual spending.</p>
<p>Armstrong say all the parties should come clean about their “fiscal plan”, as the Greens have promised to do before the election.. But he errs when he say it is incumbent upon ACT to do so to. We have already done so.</p>
<p>In May we produced an Alternative Budget, which can be found <a href="http://www.act.org.nz/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=12727&qid=2186184">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>“We are the only party planning to cut government spending – specifically, on middle-class welfare, such as interest-free student loans, and on corporate welfare of the type dispensed by MBIE. These savings would allow us to cut the top rate of income tax to 24% next year. We could also cut the company tax rate to 20% next year and to 12.5% by 2020. This would benefit all New Zealanders by dramatically increasing the rate of economic growth.”</p>
<p>“ACT is the only party that is not living down to Menken’s low expectations of politicians.’ Said Dr Whyte.</p>
