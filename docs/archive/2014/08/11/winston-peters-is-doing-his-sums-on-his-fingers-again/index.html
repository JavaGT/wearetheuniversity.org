<p>Winston Peters is doing his sums on his fingers again</p>
<p>Press release: ACT New Zealand<br>August 11, 2014. 3:15pm</p>
<p>“If proof were needed that Winston Peters is making policy on the fly his promise that $1000 deposited in a Kiwi Saver account at birth would accumulate over time to pay for a University degree sheets it home,” said Dr Jamie Whyte ACT Party leader today.</p>
<p>“If Mr. Peters had spent ten minutes checking out the Retirement Commission’s web page he would have learnt the best return from the &#39;Winston’s buy the baby vote scheme&#39; would be 3 percent a year.</p>
<p>&quot;That means by the time recipients are 24 the &#39;thousand dollar baby bonus&#39; would be worth just $2,000. The whole idea is just a bonus to the fund managers.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no way Winston’s buy the baby vote bonus will pay for university,” said Dr Whyte.</p>
<p>“With current inflation it will probably buy their first beer.”</p>
