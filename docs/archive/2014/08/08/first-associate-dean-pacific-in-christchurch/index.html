<p><strong>FIRST ASSOCIATE DEAN PACIFIC IN CHRISTCHURCH</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First Spokesperson for Pacific Island Affairs Asenati Lole-Taylor is pleased to see positive leadership by the University of Otago in announcing their first Associate Dean Pacific for Pasifika health sciences students in Christchurch.</p>
<p>“I would like to congratulate Dr. Kiki Maoate on his appointment to the new position,” says Mrs Lole-Taylor. “He has gained valuable experience in his career as a specialist paediatric surgeon in the Canterbury region and across the Pacific, and I am sure he will have plenty to teach our young students coming through.</p>
<p>“It is very encouraging when busy professionals like Dr Maoate make time to give back to their local communities by sharing their wealth of experience.</p>
<p>“I am sure he will be a fine leader like his father, the late Sir Terepai Maoate, former Prime Minister of the Cook Islands.</p>
<p>“I would like to offer my best wishes and full support to Dr Maoate as he embarks on this journey to lead our Pasifika students toward academic success,” says Mrs Lole-Taylor.</p>
