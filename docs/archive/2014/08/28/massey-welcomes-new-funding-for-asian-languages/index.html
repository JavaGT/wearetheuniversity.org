<p>Massey welcomes new funding for Asian languages</p>
<p>An announcement that the Government will invest $10 million over five years to increase the provision of Asian language teaching in schools has been welcomed<br>by Massey University’s College of Humanities and Social<br>Sciences Pro Vice-Chancellor.</p>
<p>Distinguished Professor Paul Spoonley says Education Minister Hekia Parata’s announcement yesterday is important in preparing young New Zealanders to be<br>leaders in the new global economy.</p>
<p>“Given the need for New Zealand to trade into non-English speaking countries, the ability to speak a range of languages has become a priority,” he said.</p>
<p>“The history of New Zealand in providing language teaching in schools is patchy, partly because it hasn’t been seen as a priority and partly because New<br>Zealanders don’t have a strong history of multilingualism<br>in their own homes and communities. That’s now changing, with significant non-English immigrant communities. But much more needs to be done.”</p>
<p>Ms Parata’s statement says the money will be used to create a contestable fund where schools can apply for funding to establish new Mandarin, Japanese or<br>Korean language programmes, or expand or enhance existing Asian language programmes.</p>
<p>Professor Spoonley says his college’s School of Humanities – which offers Japanese, Chinese, Spanish and French language programmes at its Manawatū and Albany campuses, and by distance learning – is keen to work both with the Government and with schools to encourage languages as an important part of<br>the curriculum with both personal and national benefits.</p>
