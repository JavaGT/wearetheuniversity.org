<p>The Wellington campus is home of the School of Art and the School of Design, the latter ranked by global design organisation Red Dot as 4th best in the Asia/Pacific. It is also where New Zealand’s oldest and most respected journalism school is based, and where you can see a state-of-the-art design facility offering digital sound, animation and filming suites, as well as the campus’ own Digital Fabrication Laboratory and Open Lab enterprises.</p>
<p>As part of Open Day activities, information sessions for distance learners, international students and Māori and Pasifika support networks, as well as sessions on cultural and sporting activiities and student welfare will be run in the morning and afternoon.</p>
