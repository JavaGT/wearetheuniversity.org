<p><strong>Wednesday, 20 August 2014, 1:06 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Public talk on global sustainability</strong></p>
<p>How human pressure is changing the planet is the topic of the only Wellington public lecture being given by Professor Yuan T Lee, President of the International Council for Science, during his visit to New Zealand.</p>
<p>The free public lecture is being presented by Victoria University of Wellington, in partnership with Universities New Zealand – Te Pōkai Tara.</p>
<p>In his talk on 5 September, Professor Lee will outline why a deep transformation to global sustainability is needed, beginning immediately with dramatic reductions in human footprint, population growth and consumption.</p>
<p>“We already know enough to act. The unprecedented threats we face dictate that we must have the fierce urgency of now. It is time to go all out,” he says.</p>
<p>During his distinguished career, Professor Lee has received numerous awards and honours, including the United States National Medal of Science and Faraday Medal and Prize from the Royal Chemical Society of Great Britain.</p>
<p>In 1986, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his seminal contribution to the development of reaction dynamics—a new field of research in chemistry at the time.</p>
<p>Professor Lee is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the science academies of many other countries, and has received Honorary Doctorates from 40 universities around the world.</p>
<p>He has contributed to the International Council for Science for over 20 years and was appointed President in 2011.</p>
<p>Professor Mike Wilson, Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Science at Victoria, says it is a great honour to have someone of Professor Lee’s calibre in Wellington to share his unique insights into global sustainability.</p>
<p>Professor Lee is visiting New Zealand for the 31st General Assembly of the International Council for Science, taking place in Auckland between 25 August and 3 September, and the associated World Science Week New Zealand.</p>
