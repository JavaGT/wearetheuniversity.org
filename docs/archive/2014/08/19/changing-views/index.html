<p><strong>Changing views</strong></p>
<p>When reading a book or watching a film or television show, many of us expect to be taken on a journey involving a character who changes. But where does this desire to see a transformation come from?</p>
<p>Professor Damien Wilkins will explore this question in his inaugural lecture titled “No hugging, some learning: writing and personal change”, and says his goal is perhaps to see some change of thinking by both the optimists and cynics in the audience.</p>
<p>“I want people to think what the other possibilities are when reading a story.</p>
<p>“It’s just as bad to be artificially cheery as it is to be artificially disillusioned.”</p>
<p>The lecture’s title borrows from the TV show <em>Seinfeld</em>, whose writers tried to avoid clichés associated with sitcoms, where “someone learns something and there is hugging at the end of each episode.</p>
<p>“It’s a cathartic release for viewers–seeing the nasty person turn nice or whatever—but the writers of <em>Seinfeld</em> wanted to do something different.</p>
<p>“But once you have that idea that change is a bit lame, what do you write about? In literature, how can you save the precious notion of transformation from this naffness?”</p>
<p>As part of the free public lecture, Professor Wilkins will discuss New Zealand author Dennis McEldowney’s 1957 memoir, <em>The World Regained.</em> “I chose this book because I think it’s a New Zealand classic which is little read.</p>
<p>“Dennis shows us one way of dramatising change which takes into account both pain and joy. It’s a very beautiful book.”</p>
<p><em>The World Regained</em> gives Dennis’ account of a life-saving operation for his congenital heart condition.</p>
