<p>Regional issues top agenda for election debate</p>
<p>Wellington regional issues, from the flyover to extending the airport, will be in the spotlight at an election debate at Massey University’s Wellington campus<br>tomorrow.</p>
<p>Candidates from across the city and the political spectrum will attempt to address the question of how best to support regional economic growth during the<br>Wellington Employers’ Chamber of Commerce General Election Debate 2014 on August 20.</p>
<p>Many of the city’s business and governance leaders will be attending the event.</p>
<p>Wellington Central MP Grant Robertson of Labour will be joined by Green Party candidate for the same electorate James Shaw, National Party Hutt South candidate Chris Bishop, Ohariu MP Peter Dunne of United Future and Internet Party chief executive Vikram Kumar for the debate, which will be moderated by Massey University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey.</p>
<p>Candidates will answer questions from a panel of Wellington business and media identities as well as from the audience during the debate.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce president John Milford says the questions are likely to focus on Wellington regional issues such as; the Basin Flyover, local government amalgamation, runway extension, earthquake strengthening, the region’s infrastructure and the Living Wage.</p>
<p>“This debate is purposely Wellington focused _ we absolutely, positively believe in our capital city and want to hear from the candidates – many of whom are likely to make it into Parliament – on what they’d do to support growth.”</p>
<p>The debate, in association with Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, is on at the theatrette at Entrance D, Buckle St, of Massey’s Wellington campus from 5.30pm to 7.30pm on Wednesday August 20<br>.<br>ends</p>
