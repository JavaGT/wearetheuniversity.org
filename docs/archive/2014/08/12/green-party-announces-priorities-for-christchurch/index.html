<p>Green Party announces priorities for Christchurch</p>
<p>The Green Party has today announced its plan for a fairer, smarter and more democratic Canterbury rebuild, with a focus on smart transport solutions, restoring local democracy, and keeping Christchurch’s assets.</p>
<p>The plan sits across all of the Green Party’s priorities this election for a cleaner, fairer and smarter New Zealand.</p>
<p>The key policy points in the Green Party’s Greener Christchurch plan are:</p>
<p>1. A $462 million investment in smart transport solutions for Christchurch over five years, including establishing Canterbury Transport - a single body responsible for transport across Greater Christchurch, as well as investing in safe cycling and public transport</p>
<p>2. A commitment to remove any pressure on the Christchurch City Council to sell strategic assets by putting a new stadium on hold and a more flexible approach to the cost-sharing agreement</p>
<p>3. A commitment to restoring local democracy by holding regional council elections at ECan in 2015, removing the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority’s emergency powers, and returning power to the Christchurch City Council</p>
<p>4. Greening the rebuild with $20 million allocated to progressing the Avon-Otakaro River Park and $15 million for climate change adaptation.</p>
<p>“The Green Party is committed to a greener, fairer, smarter and more democratic Canterbury rebuild,” Green Party Christchurch spokesperson Eugenie Sage said today.</p>
<p>“We will prioritise smart transport solutions, a greener rebuild, a return of local democracy, and projects that put the needs of Christchurch people first.</p>

<p>“The National Government has got its priorities for Christchurch wrong.</p>
<p>“For Christchurch, three more years of National will see asset sales, increasing transport woes and a lack of democracy.</p>
<p>“It’s time for a change of leadership and decision-making style. With our policies, we’re providing the people of Christchurch with a clear choice.</p>
<p>“It’s time to give someone else a go. Gerry Brownlee and National have had their chance.</p>
<p>“Leaving National in charge of the rebuild is putting Christchurch assets and the city’s long-term wellbeing at risk. We don’t have to sell Christchurch’s future.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t be the rebuild versus assets. There’s a deep irony in the idea that to rebuild a city you have to lose assets that make a city great.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, Christchurch residents are facing the daily effects of the earthquakes - congested roads, cold houses, and an ever-changing city as Christchurch rebuilds.</p>
<p>“The Green Party has already committed $60 million to warm up Christchurch homes with insulation and clean heating solutions. Christchurch will also gain from our other election priorities through cleaner rivers, thriving kids and smarter jobs,” said Ms Sage.</p>
<p>“Today we’re announcing a $462 million investment in smart transport solutions for Christchurch over the next five years,” said Green Party transport spokesperson Julie Anne Genter.</p>
<p>“A big investment in walking and cycling, and buses and trains will have a massive impact on Christchurch’s congestion problems.</p>
<p>“We will make cycling and public transport safe and great again in Christchurch. It’s time to rebuild Christchurch’s proud history of being an easy city to get around.</p>
<p>“We will also create Canterbury Transport - a single body responsible for transport strategy, planning and delivery across Greater Christchurch - to ensure a coordinated approach to transport as the city rebuilds,” said Ms Genter.</p>
<p>“In Government, the Green Party is committed to help Christchurch become a better, more resilient and sustainable city”, said Ms Sage.</p>
