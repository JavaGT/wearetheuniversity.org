<p><strong>Chris Bishop</strong></p>
<p>National Candidate for Hutt South</p>
<p><strong>Media Release</strong></p>
<p>12 August 2014</p>
<p><strong>Recycling facility boost for local jobs</strong></p>
<p>The Government&#39;s $4 million investment into a new plastic recycling facility to be built in Lower Hutt will help create local jobs and better protect the environment, says National Candidate for Hutt South Chris Bishop.</p>
<p>&quot;I welcome the smart investment into Flight Plastics as another example of the National-led Government backing our local exporters,&quot; says Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>The grant is funded from the Waste Minimisation Fund, and follows an extensive feasibility study undertaken in 2011.</p>
<p>&quot;Flight Plastics is a great example of the types of innovative industries we can build in the Hutt. The plant is a world-class facility capable of producing fully compliant and safe food packaging from recycled PET plastic,&quot; says Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of exporting masses of plastic waste to Asia, we&#39;ll be able to process thousands of tonnes of waste right here in Lower Hutt – reducing waste and creating jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;Upgrading our transport links, building on the work of Callahan Innovation and rolling out ultra-fast broadband will help encourage more investment into high-tech manufacturing in the Hutt,&quot; says Mr Bishop.</p>
<p><strong>About Flight Plastics:</strong></p>
<p>Flight Plastics manufactures plastic food packaging for New Zealand and international food production companies, including key exporters such as New Zealand King Salmon and Cadbury. Flight Plastics has approximately 200 employees. In 2012 the company’s revenue was approximately $20 million, 70 percent of which was export revenue.</p>
