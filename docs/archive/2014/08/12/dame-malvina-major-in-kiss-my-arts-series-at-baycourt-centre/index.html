<p>Dame Malvina Major in Kiss my Arts series at Baycourt Centre</p>
<p>Internationally renowned opera singer Dame Malvina Major will speak about how the voice functions as part of the 2014 Kiss my Arts series. The presentation will include DVD examples that highlight what a performer is asked to do in an opera production: while maintaining vocal excellence, the performer must also deliver the languages and acting skills required of the role.</p>
<p>Dame Malvina Major is a Senior Fellow in Music at the University of Waikato and has had an outstanding international career. She has had major opera roles all over the world before returning to New Zealand to teach and perform throughout the country. In the 2012 Queens Birthday Honours she received The New Zealand Order of Merit. She actively gives back to the community through the Dame Malvina Major foundation which was first formed in 1992 to support the training of young New Zealand artists.</p>
<p>The Kiss my Arts series is a collaboration of The University of Waikato and Baycourt Community and Arts Centre in Tauranga. Each creative conversation is designed to inform, engage and explore various aspects of the arts.</p>
<p>Thursday 14 August, 5.30pm at Baycourt Community and Arts Centre. Entry is by gold coin donation.</p>
