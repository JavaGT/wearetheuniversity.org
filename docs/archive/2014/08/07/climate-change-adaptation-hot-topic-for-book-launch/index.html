<p>Climate change adaptation hot topic for book launch</p>
<p>Climate change and ways to prepare for the worst effects of natural hazards are hot topics in a newly-published book featuring the work of international and New Zealand researchers being launched on at Massey’s Wellington campus.</p>
<p>Adapting to Climate Change, which is co-edited by Professor Bruce Glavovic, the EQC Chair in Natural Hazards Planning at Massey’s School of People, Environment and Planning, will be launched on Thursday August 14.</p>
<p>The book identifies lessons already learned from past experiences of natural hazards through case studies of severe storms, sea-level related hazards, droughts, heat waves, wildfires, floods, (including the 2004 Manawatū floods) earthquakes and tsunami, in North America, Europe, Australasia, Asia, Africa and small island developing states.</p>
<p>Professor Glavovic says the book draws upon the work of experts from around the world, including New Zealanders, who are involved in wide-ranging research, teaching, professional development and community service on matters related to reducing disaster risk, building community resilience and adapting to climate change.</p>
<p>This work includes the University’s membership of the New Zealand Climate Change Centre - an initiative with the country’s Crown Research Institutes as well as the University of Canterbury and Victoria University.</p>
<p>The Centre’s goal is to “enhance the capacity of New Zealand, both domestically and in partnership with other countries to anticipate, mitigate and adapt to climate change.”</p>

<p>Professor Glavovic says the Centre provides a forum for Massey to participate with key players in dialogue and shape the climate change research agenda in New Zealand and help “bridge the science-policy-practice gap”.</p>
<p>It also encourages greater engagement on climate change between research organisations and the Government and internally within Massey.</p>
<p>Professor Glavovic will be joined at the launch for a discussion about how communities can plan</p>
<p>for and adapt to climate change by one of the New Zealand contributors to the book Michele Daly from GNS Science.</p>
<p>Adapting to Climate Change co-edited by Professor Glavovic and Gavin Smith is being launched at the Museum Building of Massey University’s Wellington campus at 5.30pm on Thursday August 14.</p>
