<p><strong>AUT celebrates Winter Graduation</strong></p>
<p>AUT University is celebrating its Winter Graduation this week as 2,428 students receive their qualifications at one of five ceremonies over the next two days. As well as the graduands, the next two days will be a time for celebration for proud friends and family to relish academic success.</p>
<p>The make-up of AUT’s 2,428 graduands is 664 Postgraduate, of which 45 are Doctorate and 335 are Masters and 1,764 Undergraduate graduands.</p>
<p>Analysis in several countries including New Zealand has identified that by far the greatest economic return from investment in university comes not from research and innovation but from graduates. It is graduates who take knowledge into industry, into the workplace and into places of innovation and entrepreneurship. They also take new ideas into the community, into the whānau, into the home, into the committee room, benefitting civil society, building social cohesion and creating culturally richer lives.</p>
<p>AUT’s winter graduation is being held on Thursday, 7 August and Friday, 8 August. Prior to the first ceremony on Thursday, our graduands take part in a graduation procession from Albert Park, along Queen Street, through the Auckland CBD, finishing at the Aotea Centre where the ceremonies will take place.</p>
