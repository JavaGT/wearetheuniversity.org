<p><strong>Sunday, 3 August 2014, 1:48 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National selects Christopher Penk as Kelston candidate  </p>
<p>The National Party has announced that Christopher Penk will be its candidate for the Kelston electorate at the 2014 General Election.</p>
<p>“Christopher has a genuine will to serve. As a resident of Kelston, he understands the issues that matter most to its residents at this election and will make an outstanding local MP,” said Northern Regional Chair Andrew Hunt.</p>
<p>Mr Penk said he was honoured to be selected and would be running a strong campaign to win more party votes for National in the seat.</p>
<p>“National’s plan for a stronger economy with more jobs, better public services in health and education, more support for families, and safer communities is delivering for Kelston communities. I’ll be working tirelessly to ensure we can keep New Zealand heading in the right direction.”</p>
<p>National re-opened selection for the Kelston electorate after the decision by List MP Claudette Hauiti to retire from politics at the election.</p>
<p>“I also want to acknowledge Claudette for the work she has done to date as a National MP in the Northern Region,” said Mr Hunt.</p>
<p>As the National Party List has already been selected, Mr Penk will enter National’s List at the position of 68. Placing him, as an electorate candidate, ahead of other candidates not standing in seats, but behind other electorate candidates.</p>
