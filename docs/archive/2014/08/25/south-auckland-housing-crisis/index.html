<p>Su’a William<br>SIO</p>
<p>Pacific Affairs Spokesperson<br>25 August 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>South Auckland housing crisis</strong></p>
<p>National’s HomeStart package is nothing more than a political stunt designed to beguile South Auckland voters, said Labour’s Pacific Affairs spokesperson Su’a William Sio.</p>
<p>“Few working Pasifika and Maori workers in South Auckland will be able to buy their own home under this scheme given the hard economic conditions many are currently facing.</p>
<p>“As long as National has no plans to reduce high unemployment and increase low wages, this is nothing more than political trickery.</p>
<p>“We’ve already seen from Dr Lisa Marriott’s research released last week, that the economic circumstances for low income New Zealanders are continuing to go backwards over a range of indicators including tertiary education, employment and incomes.</p>
<p>“The government may not believe there’s a housing crisis but everyone that is working at the coal face of the community in South Auckland knows there’s a housing crisis.</p>
<p>“People living in cold, concrete floored garages, or sleeping in cars are not signs of a brighter future National promised in the last election. In the last 8 years Pasifika home ownership has fallen to 18.5% while Maori home ownership also dropped to 28.2% for the same period.</p>
<p>“People can only afford and sustain regular payments on a mortgage or market rents when people are in full-time permanent jobs earning high incomes, not casual or part-time work on minimum wage.</p>
<p>“Labour’s answer to the housing crisis is far more comprehensive and realistic – it’s about building more affordable homes, creating more jobs, higher incomes and the best start for our children including educational opportunities and healthcare,” said Su’a William Sio.</p>
