<p><strong>Monday, 25 August 2014, 4:24 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour’s culture of science and innovation</p>
<p>Labour will create a culture of science and innovation in New Zealand that will be the envy of the world, says Labour’s Innovation, Research and Development spokesperson Megan Woods.</p>
<p>“Labour believes that good science lies at the heart of a modern society and a modern economy, helping New Zealanders lead healthier lives, have better education as well as creating new businesses with high-value jobs</p>
<p>“When Labour invests in science, research and development, it’s not just to increase corporate balance sheets, it is to increase pay packets. We want to create a culture of science and innovation.</p>
<p>“We will do this through key policies including:</p>
<p>• A research and development tax credit at the rate of 12.5%.<br>•<br>• An increase in our public science spend to link New Zealand to the OECD average over time and as fiscal conditions permit.<br>•<br>• Post-doctoral fellowships for recent PhD graduates, so they are supported into research careers in New Zealand instead of overseas.<br>•<br>• Increasing bonded scholarships in areas of identified teaching shortages, including science and mathematics.<br>•<br>• ‘Garage Grants’ to enable and support entrepreneurs in transforming their clever idea into something big.<br>•<br>• ‘X prizes’ for New Zealand, developed &amp; run by the Chief Science Advisor and the new role of Chief Technology Officer.</p>
<p>“The role of government is to lay the foundations to establish the environment in which science, innovation and great design will flourish.</p>
<p>“Labour will work with schools, universities, crown research institutes and businesses to help create a genuine culture of science and innovation,” says Megan Woods.</p>
