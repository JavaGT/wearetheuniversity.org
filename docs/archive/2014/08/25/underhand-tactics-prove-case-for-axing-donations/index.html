<p>Underhand tactics prove case for axing donations</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/10418869/Schools-are-pushing-donation-boundaries">Revelations</a> that schools are using underhand tactics to coerce donations from cash-strapped parents further highlights the need for Labour&#39;s plan to increase funding so they aren&#39;t dependent on contributions from parents, Labour&#39;s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>“By law New Zealand children are guaranteed a free school education, but government funding simply hasn&#39;t kept up with the cost of delivering that.</p>
<p>“Labour&#39;s plan to give an extra $100 per student per year to schools that don&#39;t ask for donations will go a long way to addressing that issue.</p>
<p>“Over the past year we&#39;ve seen schools resort to all sorts of tactics to get money out of parents; from shaming those who don&#39;t pay through the use of kids’ bag tags, through to banishing kids whose parents don&#39;t pay to the school hall.</p>
<p>“Now we have revelations that schools are asking parents to sign a declaration agreeing to pay the donations as a condition of enrolment. That&#39;s just not on.</p>
<p>“I can understand why schools are doing this, they&#39;re desperate for the money.</p>
<p>“Education Minister Hekia Parata has her head buried in the sand when she insists that schools get enough funding to deliver the curriculum. They simply don&#39;t.</p>
<p>“Even Bill English acknowledged the huge pressure parents were under to make donations, yet under his watch the problem is getting much worse.</p>
<p>“Free public education has always been a priority for Labour and our commitment to tackling parental donations is another clear demonstration of that,” Chris Hipkins says.</p>
