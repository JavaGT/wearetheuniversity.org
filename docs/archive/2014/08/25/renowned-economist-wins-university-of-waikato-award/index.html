<p><strong>Media Release</strong></p>
<p><strong>Renowned economist wins University of Waikato award</strong></p>
<p>One of New Zealand’s best-known economists will receive a Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Waikato next month.</p>
<p><strong>Esteemed career in finance</strong><br>The University says Dr Arthur Grimes’ career has been one full of commitment and passion and his contribution to public policy has been immense.</p>
<p>In 1979 Dr Grimes graduated from the University of Waikato with a Bachelor of Social Sciences with first class honours, before heading off to work at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand as a research officer.</p>
<p>By 1984 he’d packed his bags for the UK and the London School of Economics (LSE) where he completed a Master of Science with distinction in economics and embarked on his PhD. He won a number of awards at LSE, most notably the Sayers Prize for a Distinguished Thesis in Monetary Economics and the Robert McKenzie Prize for Outstanding Performance in a PhD.</p>
<p>Dr Grimes returned to the Reserve Bank, working his way up to chief economist and playing a major part in the revision of the Reserve Bank Act.</p>
<p>He left the Reserve Bank in 1993 to become chief economist at the National Bank of New Zealand and then Chief Executive at Southpac. In September last year he completed a decade on the Reserve Bank Board as Chair and non-executive director</p>
<p><strong>Sidestep into academia</strong><br>Dr Grimes sidestepped neatly into academia when he became director of the Institute of Policy Studies at Victoria University in 1998, where he stayed for four years promoting and analysing public policy issues, chairing policy groups and supervising postgraduate study.</p>

<p>He’s currently Senior Fellow at Motu Economic and Public Policy Research Trust, an adjunct professor at the University of Auckland (and was formally an adjunct professor at Waikato), chair of the Hugo Strategy Panel and a member of the Financial Markets Authority Board.</p>
<p>Dr Grimes says he is honoured to receive a Distinguished Alumni Award. “My training at the University of Waikato as a social scientist, majoring in economics, gave me excellent preparation for my subsequent studies at the London School of Economics and for my roles in each of the public, private and research sectors. I am delighted and honoured to have come full circle with this award.”</p>
<p>Over the years Dr Grimes has secured three Marsden Grants and published more than 60 refereed journal articles. In 2005 he was awarded the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research Economics Award recognising excellence in economics that relate to New Zealand’s economic welfare, and last year he was awarded the NZ-UK Link Visiting Professorship to the University of London.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says Dr Grimes’ achievements are widespread. “His contributions to public policy, academia and fostering a positive research community make him a very worthy recipient of a Distinguished Alumni Award.”</p>
<p><strong>Distinguished Alumni Award</strong><br>The University of Waikato’s Distinguished Alumni Awards for 2014 will be presented on September 19 at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts.</p>
<p>This year, as the University marks its 50th anniversary, four alumni will be recognised with Distinguished Alumni Awards. The other recipients are adventurer, consultant and motivational speaker Jamie Fitzgerald; author and inaugural director of the Pacific Island Education Resource Centre Le Mamea Taulapapa Sefulu Ioane and CEO of Waikato-Tainui Te Kauhanganui Parekawhia McLean.</p>
<p>The Distinguished Alumni Awards celebrate and honour Waikato alumni who have made outstanding contributions in their careers and communities, taking into account excellence in the professional, cultural, creative and voluntary sectors.</p>
<p>All recipients receive a limited edition cast-glass figure created exclusively by award-winning local artist Di Tocker.</p>
