<p>Tate Land Agency Addresses Housing Crisis</p>
<p>New Zealand First’s plan for a state agency to buy and hold land is common sense, and will be effective into the future, says New Zealand First Housing spokesperson Denis O’Rourke.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First’s policy cuts to one of the core problems, while National fiddles as the dream of a home for most young Kiwis lies in ashes. Their announcement of KiwiSaver changes will not address the housing crisis which they deny exists.</p>
<p>“The crisis is fuelled by too many buyers, including foreign speculators, well-off Kiwis buying rental properties and red hot immigration levels. It is made worse by the lack of houses being built.</p>
<p>&quot;The National government has done nothing over six years - their figures on house building largely relate to post earthquake Canterbury.</p>
<p>“In New Zealand&#39;s very small economy, it is essential for the government to invest directly to ensure that the supply of smaller and more affordable homes are built in the numbers needed.</p>
<p>“National has ignored housing, leaving it to the profit making private sector. It has not worked.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First plans to have more affordable sections to be sold over 25 years, at 2 per cent interest for at least the first five years.</p>
<p>“Some such land must also be used for Housing New Zealand to build the tens of thousands of state rentals for people whose only option is to rent a home.</p>
<p>&quot;The government&#39;s chronic slothfulness in addressing all aspects of the housing crisis cannot be solved by knee-jerk electioneering announcements in the absence of a comprehensive housing plan,” says Mr O’Rourke.</p>
