<p><strong>Waikato University prepares for Kīngitanga Day</strong></p>
<p>The University of Waikato is gearing up for Kīngitanga Day next month - an annual celebration of the relationship between the university and the Kīngitanga.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato has had strong connections with the Kīngitanga and Waikato-Tainui since the university was founded in 1964 and it is this relationship that the university honours each year through Kīngitanga Day.</p>
<p>Professor Linda Smith, the university’s Pro Vice-Chancellor (Māori), says the calibre of speakers Kīngitanga Day attracts is testimony to the growing following the event has locally and nationally.</p>
<p>“Our relationship with the Kīngitanga and Waikato-Tainui, but also many other iwi across the country, has always been a fundamental aspect of this university,” says Professor Smith.</p>
<p>“And Kīngitanga Day is a great opportunity to strengthen and build on these relationships. It’s an opportunity to celebrate our distinctive heritage and history, and it’s also our chance to engage with the wider community.”</p>
<p>This year’s keynote speaker is Dr Lance O’Sullivan, who will speak on “Advancing Māori Health from the Flax Roots”. Named 2014 New Zealander of the Year, the Kaitaia-based GP is a passionate advocate for Māori health and a pioneer for equal healthcare in the community. Dr O’Sullivan is speaking at 9am in the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts concert chamber.</p>
<p>Throughout the day presentations and seminars take place with topics ranging from “Ngā Pakanga Whenua – The Flashpoints of War” and “Ngā Tohu o te Taiao – Use of Mātauranga and Science for Managing Mahinga Kai”.</p>

<p>There will be stick and poi demonstrations, food stalls, presentations, panels, workshops, exhibitions, performances and activities. No classes are scheduled on the day to give staff and students a chance to get involved.</p>
<p>Kīngitanga Day is on Thursday, September 18 and starts at 9am. Most activities are free and open to the public.</p>
