<p><strong>Reports: Aotearoa stands in solidarity with Palestine</strong></p>
<p>July 21, 2014<br><a href="http://fightback.org.nz/2014/07/21/reports-aotearoa-stands-in-solidarity-with-palestine/">http://fightback.org.nz/2014/07/21/reports-aotearoa-stands-in-solidarity-with-palestine/</a></p>
<p><em>Fightback supports the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement as a tactic to show solidarity with Palestinian resistance. The following reports are from demonstrations over the weekend from Fightback activists and supporters.</em></p>
<p>In <strong>Auckland</strong>, around 3000 people turned out on a miserably cold day to protest the latest Israeli attacks on Gaza. The rally heard speakers including John Minto from Mana, Roger Fowler from Kia Ora Gaza, Marama Davidson and Kennedy Graham from the Greens, and Mike Treen from Global Peace and Justice Alliance. Two young Palestinian girls also addressed the rally. A loud, vibrant march down Queen Street followed, with colourful banners, Palestinian flags and placards, and chants of “Free, Free Palestine”. The march ended at the US Consulate where protesters laid olive branches in memory of the victims of Israel’s genocide. The protest ended a song from Roger Fowler, “We are all Palestinians”.</p>
<p>In <strong>Christchurch</strong> over 200 people gathered outside the Cathedral after just a few days’ notice to stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine. The rally, organised by &#39;Canterbury for Justice in Palestine&#39; managed to raise $668 to go towards helping those in Gaza. Speakers included Martin &amp; Lois of CJP, Brian Turner from the NZ Palestinian Human Rights lobby, Pauline McKay the current CWS director, Michael Hosking – long-time activist for Palestine, and Ben Peterson speaking on behalf of UNITE union. The crowd then marched down Colombo street and through Cashel Mall with chants of “From the river to the sea Palestine will be free” - receiving many toots of support from passing motorists. Without any regard for the low temperatures, much of the crowd stuck around for half an hour after the end of the event to network and plan further actions and organising. The consensus was clear: only with justice for Palestine can we achieve peace.</p>

<p>In <strong>Wellington</strong>, 300 people attended a rally outside the Israeli Embassy. A number of Palestinians spoke on their experiences in Palestine and the Middle East recently, as well as speakers from the Wellington Palestine and the Wellington Boycott Divestment and Sanctions groups. Like the recent protests against the Batsheva Dance Company performances in Wellington, around 50 fundamentalist Christians were bussed down from Napier/Hastings to stage a counter protest on a parallel street to the pro-Palestine rally.</p>
<p>A crowd upwards of two hundred marched in <strong>Dunedin</strong>&#39;s CBD on Saturday bringing the usual flurry of shopping traffic to a halt as pleas were chanted to &#39;FREE FREE PALESTINE&#39;. The demonstrators were met at the cities heart, the Octagon, by representatives of the Greens, Mana Party, and the local Muslim community, where, in the downpour of rain, they joined in solidarity for the people of Palestine, showing their commitment to oppose the Zionist regime of Israel, demanding that not only the people of New Zealand, and it&#39;s Government, but also of the UN and International community, not stand by in silence as Israel continues its ethnic cleanse of the Palestinian people. The crowd occupied the Octagon for over an hour in communion, even with the presence of a lonesome four pro-Israel individuals holding placards with anti-Hamas slogans.</p>
