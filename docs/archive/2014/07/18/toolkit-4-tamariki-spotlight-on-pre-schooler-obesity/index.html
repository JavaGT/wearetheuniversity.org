<p>Toolkit 4 Tamariki: Spotlight on pre-schooler obesity</p>
<p>Waikato University clinical psychology student Julie Chatwin wants to talk to parents who have concerns that their pre-schooler may be an unhealthy weight.</p>
<p>Julie is completing her Master of Social Sciences concurrently with a postgraduate Diploma in Psychology (Clinical) and is looking to better understand how parents perceive a number of known risk factors for pre-schooler obesity as part of her research.</p>
<p>She points out that the prevalence of childhood obesity has been increasing markedly around the world, including in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The latest New Zealand Health Survey showed a concerning proportion of children are identified as being overweight or obese. I hope my research will be able to better inform the development of programmes that support families to enjoy a healthy lifestyle. In particular, how to encourage families to participate in these programmes,” says Julie.</p>
<p>The study is a spin off from Bodywise, which is a family focused programme to assist families to make changes towards a healthy lifestyle run by Sport Waikato and Waikids (Waikato DHB) for children aged 5 – 12 years old that have been identified as being an unhealthy weight..</p>
<p>“As there is increasing recognition of the need to address obesity in younger children, I worked with the Bodywise team to adapt the programme for pre-schooler parents, known as Toolkit 4 Tamariki,” Parents who are interested in participating will be interviewed in a semi-structured format. Julie will invite participants to share their story, and to complete a card sorting exercise.</p>
<p>“The card sorting exercise is hopefully a fun and interactive way to show how they would prioritize a number of risk factors for pre-schooler obesity.”</p>
<p>“Your child does not need to have been identified as being overweight or obese, it is only relevant that you (the parent(s)) has some concerns about their weight.”</p>
<p>The interview will take no longer than an hour and each participant will be given a $25 petrol voucher in compensation for attending the interview.</p>
<p>If you are interested in taking part in Julie’s research, she can be contacted at <a href="mailto:jls57@students.waikato.ac.nz">jls57@students.waikato.ac.nz</a> for more information.</p>
