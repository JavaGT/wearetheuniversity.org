<p>Extra funds a boost for Rimutaka kiwi</p>
<p>Greater investment into Rimutaka Forest Park to ensure the survival of its kiwi population will be welcome news for local families and tourists, says National Candidate for Hutt South Chris Bishop.</p>
<p>Mr Bishop&#39;s comments follow the Government&#39;s commitment of $70,000 to the Rimutaka Forest Park Trust to enable the Trust to treble the number of stoat traps to 7,000 hectares and help ensure a long-term sustainable population of kiwi.</p>
<p>&quot;The Rimutaka Forest Park is a magnificent area enjoyed by thousands of locals and tourists every year who tramp through its many walks and hikes, so it&#39;s great to see practical investment in the indigenous birdlife that makes the area so special,&quot; said Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders thrive on exploring our country&#39;s breath-taking outdoors. These funds are another practical step from the National Government to better protect our local natural outdoors for the community to enjoy.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m proud to be part of a team that&#39;s working hard to protect the iconic wildlife under threat today, rather than dreaming about resurrecting extinct birds,&quot; said Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>The $70,000 grant is from the Community Conservation Partnership Fund announced in March this year. It provides $26 million over the next four years to community organisations undertaking natural heritage and recreation projects. The Fund will support hundreds of projects on public and private land and is particularly focused on helping the survival of the large number of New Zealand’s threatened wildlife, like the kiwi.</p>
