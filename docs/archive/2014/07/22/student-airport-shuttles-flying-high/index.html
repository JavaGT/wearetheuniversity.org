<p>Student Airport Shuttles Flying High</p>
<p>The introduction of student priced shuttles between the university and the Dunedin International Airport are a raging success announced the Otago University Students’ Association today. Between January and June over 4500 students have used the OUSA promoted service operated by Airport Shuttles Dunedin Limited.</p>
<p>“We’re astounded by the success of the shuttles and we’re rapt that it’s made travel much easier and affordable for students.” said Ruby Sycamore-Smith, OUSA President. “The trial run in 2013 gave us a good idea of what we needed to do to make it run successfully, and now we’ve worked to tweak it with Airport Shuttles Dunedin it’s just getting more and more popular.”</p>
<p>Numbers have continued to climb over 2014 with the university holidays in April and June proving to be busiest periods with over 1000 students traveling in each of these months.</p>
<p>The relationship with the Airport Shuttles Dunedin Limited has meant students are guaranteed a price of $12 to the airport and $15 from the airport to Dunedin. Other shuttle services only reduce prices to that level if the student books with a number of other people at the same time.</p>
<p>“Because the OUSA sticks to its core business it gives us the freedom to facilitate commercial opportunities with trusted partners for the benefit of students without a conflict of interest due to our own activities”, said Ms. Sycamore-Smith.</p>
<p>“The OUSA has the marketing power to promote directly to our students who are always seeking the best price or the best services.” said Ms. Sycamore-Smith. “It’s great that as we grow our networks we’re having the chance to work with some amazing Dunedin people; from small businesses to large organisations that are really having an impact on the services we can provide to our students.”</p>
<p>Working with Airport Shuttles Dunedin is a result of the OUSA’s approach of working with professional providers to run services and events rather than taking on the full risk itself.</p>
<p>“It’s a cheaper and smarter way of doing business for us.” said Ms. Sycamore-Smith.</p>
<p>All tertiary students can use the online booking service the OUSA established at <a href="http://www.studentshuttles.co.nz">www.studentshuttles.co.nz</a>.</p>
