<p><strong>Marvelly’s songwriting debut a credit to her English studies</strong></p>
<p>Lizzie Marvelly recently released her songwriting debut extended play (EP), <em>Collisions</em> and credits her Massey English studies for contributing to her songwriting abilities.</p>
<p>The talented musician, once described by Prime Minister John Key as a ‘national treasure’ has been dividing her time between her Bachelor of Arts in English and Psychology, and her musical career.</p>
<p>“I’m hugely excited to release my first self-penned EP, Miss Marvelly says.</p>
<p>“Writing, co-writing and recording this EP has been an amazing two year journey of collaboration and experimentation.”</p>
<p>Internationally recognised, Miss Marvelly’s talent was discovered by entertainers Frankie Stevens and Sir Howard Morrison, her late uncle, when she was just 16 years old.</p>
<p>By 21, Miss Marvelly had two major international record signings, international tours and two top-ten albums in classical singing.</p>
<p>Now aged 25, she has evolved her musical style, more recently working with star producers Stuart Crichton (Delta Goodrem, Jamelia, Sugarbabes) and Lindsay Rimes (Reese Mastin, Stan Walker, Benny Tipene) and focusing on a lighter ‘pop’ sound.</p>
<p>Alongside this musical success, Miss Marvelly has also been focused on her studies, which she has nearly completed.</p>
<p>“I enrolled at Massey in 2010 and I am now two and a half papers away from finishing my degree. At the end of the year I should be on track to complete my Bachelor of Arts degree with a double major in English and Psychology.”</p>

<p>As a member of the High Performance Programme which also supports student athletes, Miss Marvelly has taken advantage of the additional support on offer to enable her to fit her studies around her international performance commitments.</p>
<p>“I became a part of the Massey High Performance Programme a few years ago, and it has helped me immensely. Previously I&#39;d had to withdraw from a few papers when my music commitments became too much, but as a member of the high performance unit I&#39;ve been able to manage my studies and my music so that I can do both.</p>
<p>“I love learning, and I&#39;ve really loved my time at Massey. As a full-time professional musician, I feel a real sense of pride and achievement in finishing my degree. I hope to be able to come back to continue studying at some point in the future.</p>
