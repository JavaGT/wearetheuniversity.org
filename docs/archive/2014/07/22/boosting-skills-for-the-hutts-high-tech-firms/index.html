<p><strong>Chris Bishop</strong></p>
<p>National Candidate for Hutt South</p>
<p><strong>Media Release</strong></p>
<p>22 July 2014</p>
<p><strong>Boosting skills for the Hutt’s high-tech firms</strong></p>
<p>National Party Hutt South candidate Chris Bishop today encouraged students to take up engineering careers using the National-led Government’s additional bridging courses, work placements, and scholarships resources.</p>
<p>The government launched today a new Education to Employment (E2E) initiative to grow enrolments at institutes of technology for students wanting to become engineering technologists and technicians.</p>
<p>“National has a great record having injected more than $50 million over the last few Budgets to grow engineering student numbers, today’s announcement is about promoting the opportunities now available for students,” says Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>“I’m fully behind Lower Hutt developing its high-tech hub to support the local economy and provide jobs.</p>
<p>“This push for more engineering skills comes on top of National’s $3 million new engineering school at WelTec’s Petone campus, the announcement of a new ICT graduate school in Wellington, and the large investment in commercial science research through Callaghan Innovation based in the Hutt.</p>
<p>“In addition, I’m the only Hutt South candidate supporting investment in critical infrastructure for local high-tech firms such as the Ultra-fast Fibre Broadband rollout and better transport links through the Petone to Grenada and Transmission Gully projects.”</p>
