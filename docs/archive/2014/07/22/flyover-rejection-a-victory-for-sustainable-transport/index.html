<p>Flyover rejection a victory for sustainable transport</p>
<p>The rejection of the proposed Basin Reserve flyover by a Board of Inquiry is a victory for sustainable transport in Wellington and paves the way for other alternatives to be given a fair hearing, Wellington Labour MPs Grant Robertson and Annette King say.</p>
<p>“Labour applauds the decision of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Board of Inquiry,” says Grant Robertson.</p>
<p>“The Flyover was the wrong solution for improving transport in Wellington. The proposal exaggerated the benefits of the flyover and failed to recognise the damage it would do to an historic part of the city.</p>
<p>“Other alternatives for improving traffic flow and supporting public transport were never given a fair hearing by the Transport Agency.</p>
<p>Annette King said Labour congratulated those who worked hard to oppose this project, including the local Mount Victoria community, the Save The Basin campaign and the Architecture Centre.</p>
<p>“Labour MPs have always opposed the flyover and we are delighted that the Board of Inquiry has acknowledged the concerns of the communities we represent.</p>
<p>“We now need to focus on ensuring there is a sustainable transport plan for Wellington,” Annette King says.</p>
<p>“Labour wants to see alternatives for the Basin Reserve considered as part of a wider plan that sees congestion reduction measures alongside better public transport,” Grant Robertson says.</p>
