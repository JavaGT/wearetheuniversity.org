<p>Surgical mesh inquiry a must says Labour  </p>
<p>Labour is calling on the Minister of Health to instigate an independent inquiry into the use of surgical mesh in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Growing international concern and actions by other health regulators over complications involving this product should have set off alarm bells,” Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“Thousands of women in the US and the UK have taken lawsuits against manufacturers of the mesh after suffering complications as a result of receiving implants.</p>
<p>“While figures show that between 2010 and 2013 more than 400 New Zealand patients lodged ACC claims for mesh-implant related injuries, the exact number of people experiencing adverse reactions is unknown.</p>
<p>“A petition heard by the Health Select Committee today must act as the catalyst for action.</p>
<p>“It is not good enough for sufferers to be fobbed off or pushed between district health boards and ACC.</p>
<p>“I introduced a bill to regulate medical devices in 2007. It has yet to get a second reading. That shows exactly how low on Tony Ryall’s priority list this issue is.</p>
<p>“The two women presenting the case today – Carmel Berry and Charlotte Korte – and the hundreds of other Kiwis who have suffered agonising post-op complications are owed an inquiry.</p>
<p>“Mr Ryall has the perfect opportunity today to put aside his blinkered political stance and take leadership of this issue,” Annette King said.</p>
