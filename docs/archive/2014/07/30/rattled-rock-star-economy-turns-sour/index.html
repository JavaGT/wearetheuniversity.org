<p>Rattled rock-star economy turns sour  </p>
<p>National’s “rock-star’’ economy is rapidly turning sour as milk prices take another dive, says Labour Leader David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“We sympathise with the farmers who will struggle to stay afloat with the announcement of a drop in the price of milk solids from $7 to $6 for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p>“Dairy is a critical part of our economy but the average price for whole milk powder has now fallen 38 per cent since February, wiping billions off the books.</p>
<p>“Today’s announcement will take a further billion dollars out of the economy. The reverberations will be felt throughout the country.</p>
<p>“Labour has been saying for months that National’s so-called rock-star economy has been built on vulnerable commodity prices and Canterbury insurance cheques.</p>
<p>“National is banking on milk and disaster.</p>
<p>“Labour has a complete package of costed policies that will support and enhance traditional industries while diversifying the economy.</p>
<p>“Our monetary policy will help keep interest rates and the dollar down – assisting farmers and other exporters.</p>
<p>“Our economic upgrade, based on investment, innovation and industry will encourage a journey from volume to value – in forestry, manufacturing and other productive sectors across our cities and regions.</p>
<p>“Our Capital Gains Tax and R&amp;D tax credits will help to move the economy from speculation to innovation.</p>
<p>“Labour has a far-sighted vision for a fairer, more prosperous and sustainable society. Our policies will deliver better jobs and higher wages, affordable homes and opportunities for all New Zealand families,’’ said David Cunliffe.</p>
