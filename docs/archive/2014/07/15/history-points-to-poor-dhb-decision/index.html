<p>History points to poor DHB decision</p>
<p>A damning Government-ordered <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Fraser+Health+Authority+hospitals+among+worst+Canada/10015074/story.html">review</a> has found Nigel Murray, due to take up the role of CEO at Waikato District Health Board next week, was in charge of one of the worst-performing Canadian health authorities, Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“A just released report prepared for the Canadian Ministry of Health shows several Fraser Health Authority hospitals in British Colombia, were the worst for patient safety and quality of care.</p>
<p>“It also found the authority was the only one in BC which failed to reach its budget for three straight years despite a bigger-than-average annual funding increase.</p>
<p>“Nigel Murray, who headed that authority, takes up the reigns at Waikato on July 21.</p>
<p>“Dr Murray is not new to controversy. He was involved in a lengthy dispute involving junior doctors in Southland in 2006-2007.</p>
<p>“Labour urged the DHB to hold off confirming Dr Murray’s Waikato appointment until this latest report had been released. It declined.</p>
<p>“I also sought information from the Ministry of Health and from Health Minister Tony Ryall as to the process around the appointment, but was given the brush off.</p>
<p>“Nigel Murray will be responsible for one of New Zealand’s biggest public hospitals plus an annual budget of over $1billion, and Waikato DHB is not without its own shortcomings. A recent report noted there were too many managers, poor communication between departments, and too-slow treatment of patients.</p>
<p>“The Board is aware of Dr Murray’s track record. It will now be accountable for any decisions he makes in the future.”<br>ends</p>
