<p><strong>Canterbury education student Hurring heading to the women’s Rugby World Cup</strong></p>
<p>July 15, 2014</p>
<p>New Zealand rugby player Haile Hurring heads to the World Cup in Paris with one eye on the rugby pitch and the other on her text books.</p>
<p>Hurring is a University of Canterbury education student who is balancing her degree studies with her rugby career. She was recently named in the Black Ferns World Cup team which opens its tournament campaign against Kazakhstan on August 1. Its other World Cup games are against Ireland and the United States.</p>
<p>Hurring says the university’s College of Education staff have been hugely supportive in helping fit her studies around rugby and her World Cup preparations.</p>
<p>“There’s always work to do. Lecturers like Stuart Wise and other staff have been fantastic in providing flexibility with assignment due dates so that’s been enormously helpful. It has been tough trying to balance my university studies with Black Fern commitments but, with help from my lecturers, I hope to do everyone proud on and off the field.</p>
<p>“I head back from Paris on August 20 and go straight in to a teaching placement for seven weeks. I’ve learned teaching is full on but I love it. I’ve certainly enjoyed meeting everyone in my class. My course mates have been so supportive, even with me being away.</p>
<p>“The flexibility shown by the University of Canterbury has given me the opportunity to train and reach the level I am at. My time at Canterbury has helped a lot with my off field preparation and contribution to rugby. I enjoy doing community work and visiting schools as being part of the Black Ferns.”</p>

<p>New Zealand has won the last four women’s Rugby World Cups which does put pressure on the team, Hurring says.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is a country that expects teams to do well and having done so well in the past people think we’re invincible but we’re not. A lack of resources put into our sport is allowing other countries to catch up but we certainly set high standards of ourselves and the bar has been set pretty high.</p>
<p>“I’ll be playing fullback or wing and our outside backs possess outright pace. Our girls are more confrontational so it’s great to have variety. We can definitely change our lineup to suit our game plan and what the opposition puts in front of us.</p>
<p>“We certainly won’t be taking any game lightly. Canada and Australia will be strong but others like Ireland and USA will also be teams to watch. We really want to build a good foundation leading into the finals,” Hurring says.</p>
