<p><em>Chris Tse performs a sustained and impressive conjuring act, summoning the wandering ghost of Joe Kum Yung out of the shadows cast by his murderer Lionel Terry and offering him a life and afterlife of his own. More urgently than any stone memorial,</em> How to be Dead in a Year of Snakes <em>returns a shocking episode from New Zealand’s past to us charged with questions of justice, empathy and tolerance that remain very much alive today.</em> <strong>Chris Price, Victoria University of Wellington</strong></p>
<p><em>Chris Tse’s haunting evocation of a murdered Cantonese gold-miner touched me deeply and remains with me. In lines of quiet strength, Tse lifts the silence spread over intolerance, injustice and lost hope and returns the miner’s ‘untethered’ spirit to its homeland.</em> – <strong>Stephanie de Montalk</strong></p>
<p><strong>1905 Murder of Chinese Gold Prospector Inspires Poet</strong></p>
<p>On a Sunday in 1905 – a year of the snake – a man ‘went hunting for a Chinaman’ on Haining Street, Wellington.</p>
<p>In his first full-length collection of poetry, Chris Tse revisits the murder of Cantonese goldminer Joe Kum Yung. By paying ‘proper respect’ to the many lives consumed by the crime, Tse gives a voice to the dead man and his tragic chorus, and allows us to reflect on the experiences of Chinese migrants of the period, their wishes and hopes, their estrangement and alienation, their ghostly reverberation through a white-majority culture.</p>

<p>In poems of quietly polished, resonant language and charged imagery, he circles the events of the murder and the viewpoints from which they could be seen or told and asks us to consider our collective responsibility to remember the dead and the injustices of our past. Tse’s flickering use of imagery, resonant language and flexible pronouns are particularly suited to the historic events he describes and the viewpoints he shifts through.</p>
<p><em>The world is full of murder /and words are usually / the first to go</em></p>
<p><em>The fantails see the whole of the sky / and fill the clouds / with their opinions.</em></p>
<p>Pondering the gap between then and now, Tse asks who owns the stories, what we should seek from the past, and what we should take forward to the future. In its remarkable lyric narrative, <em>How to be Dead in a Year of Snakes</em> is an unusually expansive first collection, and a welcome poetic addition to New Zealand literature.</p>
