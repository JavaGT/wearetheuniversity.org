<p><strong>Wednesday, 16 July 2014, 10:26 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Exhibition highlights Māori Deaf students’ experiences  </p>
<p>A different educational approach by Deaf Māori rangatahi will be showcased in a new exhibition as part of Māori Language Week celebrations.</p>
<p>Dr Anne Hynds from the School of Education at Victoria University of Wellington has been involved in the unique collaborative project “Ko wai au? Who am I?”, which arose from a need to better understand the educational experience of Māori Deaf and hearing impaired youth.</p>
<p>With only a handful of trilingual interpreter in New Zealand, Dr Hynds says it has been hard for the Deaf and hearing impaired in the Māori community to connect with their whakapapa.</p>
<p>The unique collaborative project saw students from Kelston Deaf Education Centre in Auckland step out of the classroom with a goal of developing a stronger connection to their whakapapa, using photovoice and narrative methods to explore te ao Māori (the Māori world), and what this meant to them, their community and future aspirations.</p>
<p>One of the students taking part in the project, Kahurangi Mackey (Tainui), wants the resulting exhibit to showcase her pride as Māori Deaf rangatahi.</p>
<p>“The exhibition gives others the chance to discover who we are, our iwi connections and where we are from.”</p>
<p>Her image depicts her in front of a mural along with another Māori Deaf woman, representing, she says, the past and the future.</p>
<p>She hopes the exhibition will encourage Māori youth to engage more with the Māori Deaf community and to help build connections within her community.</p>

<p>Fellow student Eric Matthews (Te Rarawa/Nga Puhi) has felt a strong desire to be on the same level as his Māori peers, and to understand what happens on a marae.</p>
<p>“This is something we wanted–a connection to our maunga, awa and iwi, and what they can give to us.”</p>
<p>Eric describes the photos as a way of showing Māori pride, and says they give a snapshot into the students’ lives. “We are really encouraging our own whanau to come along, so we can show them what we can do.”</p>
<p>This project has highlighted to the students that they can become strong advocates for Māori youth.</p>
<p>“In the future, our role will be to provide youth with support, to nurture relationships built and for both the Deaf and hearing Māori community to come together,” says Eric.</p>
<p>The student-led project allowed both Deaf and hearing impaired students to make their own decisions about how they learnt about themselves and their whanau.</p>
<p>The project has been invaluable and has seen the confidence of the students grow as they learnt more about themselves, says Dr Hynds.</p>
<p>“It enabled us as teachers to listen and learn from these students.”</p>
<p>Details<br>“Ko wai au? Who am I?” is open to the public, and can be viewed all day on Wednesday 23 July, as part of Te Wiki o Te Reo celebrations at Level 3, Ministry of Education, St Pauls Square, 45 Pipitea Street, Thorndon.</p>
