<p><strong>Green Party launches Solar in Schools policy</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party will help schools install solar and save money on their power bills by investing $20 million into solar PV systems in schools.</p>
<p>The $20 million is expected to:<br>• Help around 500 schools install solar over three years<br>• Result in 6.7MW of total installed capacity<br>• Achieve annual savings of $1.64m (exclusive of GST) over the 25 year lifespan of the panels installed<br>• Achieve total savings of $41m (exclusive of GST) over the 25 year lifespan of the panels installed<br>• Allow schools to invest in other areas of teaching and learning with the money saved<br>• Educate kids, staff, parents and the wider community about clean energy</p>
<p>“In the same way that households are paying too much for power, schools’ electricity bills are too high,” said Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman.</p>
<p>“Our Solar in Schools policy will allow them to save money on electricity - money which can be invested directly into teaching and learning instead.</p>
<p>“It’s effectively increasing schools’ operations budget, in a smart, green way.</p>
<p>“Smart Green Innovation is one of the Green Party’s top three election priorities and putting solar in our schools is part of that.</p>
<p>“Solar power is growing rapidly around the world and we want New Zealand schools to be part of the cutting edge of renewable electricity generation,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>Dr Norman and Green Party energy spokesperson Gareth Hughes launched the policy at Laingholm Primary School in West Auckland today.</p>

<p>Laingholm plans to install a10KW solar system, which will save it over $2,500 a year in electricity costs.</p>
<p>“A saving of $2,500 on electricity would enable me to double the amount of money I allocate in my budget to literacy,” said Principal Martyn Weatherill. “This policy will benefit the environment and improve student achievement.”</p>
<p>“Solar PV is one of the smartest, greenest forms of electricity generation available,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“We can reduce electricity demand by powering our schools with the sun that shines during the day.</p>
<p>“Solar in Schools has the added benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and educating students, staff and the wider community about environmental sustainability and clean energy.</p>
<p>“The National Party may have no plan to reduce power bills, but the Green Party has a comprehensive set of policies that will mean cleaner, cheaper power for all New Zealanders. This includes our kids,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>Solar in Schools builds on previous Green Party energy announcements, including NZ Power, which will create a single buyer and save families around $300 a year, and Solar Homes, which will help households install solar on their roofs.</p>
