<p><strong>Todd Barclay</strong><br><strong>Candidate for Clutha-Southland</strong></p>
<p><strong>Media Release</strong></p>
<p>24 July 2014</p>
<p><strong>More kids in Southland and Otago are achieving</strong>  </p>
<p>Clutha-Southland National candidate Todd Barclay says the Public Achievement Information for 2013 shows New Zealand children are doing better across the whole education system.</p>
<p>“These results show that moves by the National Government, and the work of those in the education system, are making a real difference for all of our kids,” says Mr Barclay.</p>
<p>“What National has brought in, is a yearly snapshot of how our education system is doing, from early learning, right through to leaving school.</p>
<p>“The information we are collecting is helping us to see where children are not doing as well, and where we need to invest more time, or resources, or funding.</p>
<p>“It is allowing us to work on improving the education system so every child has the best opportunity to succeed and go on to lead the life they want.</p>
<p>“Notably, I’m pleased to see that 83.6% (up 0.9% since 2011) of kids in Otago, and 81.2% (up 2.7% since 2011) in Southland are at or above the national standard for reading.”</p>
<p>The national average for reading is 78% (up 1.7% since 2011).</p>
<p>“For maths, 78.9% (up 2.4% since 2011) of Otago kids, and 76.3% (up 2.9% since 2011) of Southland kids are at or above the national standard.”</p>
<p>The national average for maths is 75% (up 2.4% since 2011).</p>
<p>“And for writing, 76.4% (up 1.1% since 2011) of Otago kids, and 71.7% (up 1.5% since 2011) of Southland kids are at or above the national standard.”</p>

<p>The national average for writing is 71% (up 2.6% since 2011).</p>
<p>“Since National came into Government we have been working hard to improve education for young New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“Hekia Parata has delivered nearly double the funding in early childhood education so more children are participating before they start school. In 2013, 98.4% (up 0.8% since 2011) of Otago children, and 97.2% (up 2.1% since 2011) of Southland children participated in ECE before starting school.”</p>
<p>Across New Zealand in 2013, 95.6% of children participated in ECE prior to starting school.</p>
<p>“We introduced National Standards so we can intervene earlier where children are falling behind and give them the support they need to raise achievement before they begin NCEA.</p>
<p>“Since 2011, the number of 18 year olds with NCEA Level 2, or an equivalent qualification, in Otago has also gone up from 80.8% to 83.9%, and in Southland from 72.9% to 77.4%.&quot;</p>
<p>Across New Zealand, this number has increased from 74.3%, to 78.6%.</p>
<p>“And National’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative will help keep good teachers in the classroom, and enable them to share their practices and creativity with other schools so our kids will benefit.</p>
<p>“National is working hard to ensure every child gets a good education is one of the most important things National can do to raise living standards, and build a more competitive and productive economy.”</p>
