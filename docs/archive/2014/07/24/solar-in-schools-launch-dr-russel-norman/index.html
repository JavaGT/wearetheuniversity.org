<p><strong>Solar in Schools launch – Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman<br>Laingholm Primary School</strong></p>
<p>Tēnā koutou Tēnā koutou Tēnā koutou katoa.</p>
<p>Papatuanuku te whaea, tēnā koe.<br>E te whenua, tēnā koe.<br>E te tumuaki, a Martyn, tēnā koe.<br>E ngā kaiako, tēnā koutou.<br>E ngā tamariki o tēnei kura, tēnā koutou.</p>
<p>No reira tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa.</p>
<p>It’s great to be here today.</p>
<p>Thanks to Laingholm School for hosting us - in particular Principal Martyn Weatherill and Madeleine Collins, to all the pupils and to the local community members who’ve come along.</p>
<p>Thank you for the warm mihi.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all of you for Laingholm’s Green-Gold Enviro school status. No mean feat and clearly the result of a lot of hard work.</p>
<p>And big congratulations to Oliver, William, Josh and the rest of the Year 6 kids who’ve been leading the solar project.</p>
<p>You will not regret choosing sun over nuclear, I can guarantee it.</p>
<p>Before I talk about why turning energy from the sun into electricity is a great idea, I thought I’d check…who knows what it is that members of parliament like myself do?</p>
<p>Hands up who has heard of the Beehive…</p>
<p>I know it sounds like somewhere where honey is made but it’s actually somewhere laws are made.</p>
<p>It’s the place down in Wellington where politicians like me spend most days, passing news laws, updating old laws and holding the Government to account for the stuff it does.</p>
<p>We do a lot of talking down there. And a lot of debating.</p>

<p>People often say if you could take all the hot air generated in Parliament and turn it into power we wouldn’t need to look at any other energy sources.</p>
<p>But no one’s quite figured out how to do that yet, so we’re here today to talk about a wonderful form of energy which we <em>do</em> need and which we should be using more of – the sun.</p>
<p>Right now sun is hitting rooftops right across New Zealand (although if this morning’s weather forecast is to be believed, it’s taking a holiday in some places).</p>
<p>Where the sun <em>is</em> shining, it’s a bit like a tap running, with no one collecting the water.</p>
<p>We’re wasting perfectly good, free power.</p>
<p>The Green Party agrees with Oliver, William, Josh and their team that we should be harnessing it instead, and using it to help run our schools.</p>
<p>Parents and teachers here today will know that power bills in New Zealand are too high – both in our homes and in our schools.<br>Last month I was at Peria School in the far North; it’s a great little school, where it was warm enough, even in June, for most of the kids to be in bare feet.</p>
<p>Despite only having 31 pupils, the school has been paying $900 a month for power.</p>
<p>That is years and years’ worth of pocket money - every month.</p>
<p>The school decided this was crazy, and has just installed 10KW of solar, which it hopes will save it up to $6,000 every year.</p>
<p>Solar is a great fit for New Zealand schools because the vast majority of their power usage is during the day, when the sun is at its peak.</p>
<p>If New Zealand schools can save money on power, thousands of dollars are suddenly freed up to put into other areas of teaching and learning.</p>
<p>At Peria School, they plan to hire a music teacher and upgrade the school pool with the money they’ve saved.</p>
<p>I understand Laingholm is considering using its savings for a playground upgrade.<br>Hands up who’d like an even cooler playground?</p>
<p>Getting energy from the sun rather than buying it from the big electricity companies is the difference between renting power and owning it.</p>
<p>And by helping save money, solar could mean schools don’t need to call upon parents to dip into their own pockets so much to raise extra funds.</p>
<p>But the gains are not all financial.</p>
<p>One of the best summaries I’ve seen of why solar is a great idea for schools came from the principal of Pegasus Bay School in Canterbury.</p>
<p>Pegasus has a ground-breaking goal of being zero carbon. It is fully powered by solar.</p>
<p>Its Principal Roger Hornblow said: “<em>Many people say we need to leave a better planet for our children - we say we need to leave better, more informed children for our planet</em>”.</p>
<p>He is so right. When children learn first-hand about clean energy and energy efficiency, they are leaning skills they will carry through the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>This equips them to be future guardians of papatuanuku in a way that I don’t think my generation necessarily was.</p>
<p>Solar has the added benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>New Zealand has always had a head start on this front, with a lot of our electricity already coming from renewable sources.</p>
<p>But we shouldn’t be complacent.</p>
<p>We have an opportunity to create an electricity system that emits no greenhouse gases at all.</p>
<p>Thanks to a solar revolution around the world, solar PV is now cheaper and more efficient than ever.</p>
<p>But New Zealand’s uptake of solar is still low by international levels.<br>In America, <a href="http://cleantechnica.com/2014/04/18/solar-summit-launches-us-solar-to-new-growth-spurt"></a>one home or business goes solar every four minutes<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/"></a>.</p>
<p>More than a million Australian homes now have solar installed - <a href="http://aefweb.info/data/Who_pays_for_solar_energy.pdf">more than one in 10 houses</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="http://industry.gov.au/Energy/EnergyEfficiency/GrantsFunding/SolarSchoolsProgram/Pages/default.aspx">a Federal Government initiative in Australia</a> has seen solar installed in more than 60% of Australian primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>These systems are now generating enough electricity to power the equivalent of 4,600 average households, every day.</p>
<p>So where is New Zealand in all this?</p>
<p>According to the solar industry, the Government has been “ambivalent’ at best about initiatives like solar in schools.</p>
<p>The Green Party is committed to getting New Zealand up to speed and switched on to solar.</p>
<p>Most parts of New Zealand are blessed with good sunshine hours.</p>
<p>It’s time to start tapping into this and turning it into cleaner, cheaper power.</p>
<p>That’s why we’re announcing today that if in Government, we’ll put $20m over three years into kick-starting a solar revolution in our schools.</p>
<p>The funding will help over 500 schools install enough solar to make a real difference to power bills and carbon footprints.</p>
<p>It will free up thousands of dollars per school per year– money which can go into exciting projects rather than to big power companies.</p>
<p>Solar panels have an average lifespan of 25 years, so schools with panels can enjoy free power for many years to come</p>
<p>The Green Party will also ensure that schools can sell any excess power they generate back into the grid during holidays and over the long summer break.<br>So they’re not only saving money while the school is open, they’re also <em>making</em> money while the school is closed.<br>Remember how I told you just before that we make laws in the Beehive?</p>
<p>We want to make laws so that New Zealand is smarter and cleaner.</p>
<p>Solar power is a great example of something that is smart and clean.</p>
<p>It will save schools money, educate our kids about clean power, and help put New Zealand on a path to a 100% renewable electricity system.</p>
<p>Congratulations again to Laingholm for making the decision to contribute to a greener, smarter future for New Zealand.</p>
<p>I look forward to getting into Government and helping many more schools do the same.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
