<p><strong>Ten scholarships on offer worth $40,000 each</strong></p>
<p>Students wanting to apply for a scholarship worth up to $40,000 at the University of Waikato have only a month left to do so.</p>
<p>As part of this year’s 50th celebrations, the University of Waikato is offering ten Golden Jubilee School Leaver Scholarships valued at $40,000 for up to four years.</p>
<p>The scholarships will be awarded to school leavers intending to study at the University of Waikato in 2015, and will be awarded on the basis of academic excellence, leadership potential and community citizenship.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says the purpose of the scholarship is to recognise and support high achieving students.</p>
<p>“This University recognises the importance of creating socially responsible, well rounded graduates who are known for critical thinking and are able to tackle global challenges,” he says.</p>
<p>The scholarships will provide support for students to achieve academic excellence in a programme of study at the University of Waikato, to develop leadership skills through a tailored leadership and personal development programme, and to foster community involvement and participation.</p>
<p>Students wishing to apply must be enrolled in a New Zealand secondary school in 2014, be enrolling at university for the first time in 2015, and have achieved NCEA Level 2 Certificate with Merit or Excellence or the equivalent through examinations such as the Cambridge International Examination (CIE) or the International Baccalaureate (IB) examinations.</p>
<p>Applications close 1 September. For more information visit <a href="http://www.waikato.ac.nz/50">www.waikato.ac.nz/50</a>.</p>
