<p>Two Kelston schools in ACC’s Mates and Dates pilot</p>
<p>“Local school children will directly benefit early from being involved in ACC’s Mates and Dates pilot programme against sexual violence” says National MP and Kelston candidate Claudette Hauiti.</p>
<p>“This is fantastic news for our community. It’s important our young people learn the skills they need to form healthy relationships based on respect, negotiation and consent.”</p>
<p>Kelston Girls’ College and Kelston Boys’ High School have been selected as two of nine secondary schools to trial the pilot which will see up to 2000 students nationwide taught relationship skills by specialist local facilitators over five weeks. The pilot begins in term three.</p>
<p>“Sexual violence has a massive impact on victims and their families and this Government is committed to driving lasting change in preventing sexual and dating violence,” Ms Hauiti says.</p>
<p>In 2012/13, ACC funded around $44 million towards sensitive claims – all of which relate to sexual violence.</p>
<p>“By focusing on the attitudes and behaviours of young people we can reduce the harm caused to our communities by sexual and dating violence,” Ms Hauiti says.</p>
<p>The pilot will be funded by ACC and provided by local facilitators. Rape Prevention Education will facilitate Mates &amp; Dates at Kelston Girls’ College and Korowai Tumanako at Kelston Boys’ High School.</p>
<p>The Mates &amp; Dates pilot programme has been developed with input from sexual violence sector representatives, interested community groups, government agencies and specialist academics, along with input from students, parents and teachers.</p>
