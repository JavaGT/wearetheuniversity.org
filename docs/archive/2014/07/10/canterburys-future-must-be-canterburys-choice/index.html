<p>David Cunliffe<br>Labour Leader</p>
<p>10 July 2014</p>
<p><strong>Canterbury’s future must be Canterbury’s choice</strong></p>
<p>A Labour Government will restore the right of Cantabrians to make their own decisions about the future of their communities, Labour Leader David Cunliffe says.</p>
<p>“For almost four years Cantabrians have had the right to determine what they want for their communities over-ridden by a law which gives extraordinary powers to the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority and the Earthquake Recovery Minister.</p>
<p>“It is past time that power was returned to the community. It is Canterbury’s future; it should be Canterbury’s choice.</p>
<p>“To help bring that about a Labour Government will immediately appoint a board of qualified locals with the relevant skills, expertise and community connections to govern CERA.</p>
<p>“Members will be tasked with overseeing the smooth transition of CERA and the return of its powers and responsibilities to appropriate and competent local organisations.</p>
<p>“It is expected that CERA powers will be fully transitioned by the expiry of the CERA legislation in 2016.</p>
<p>“Another important step to restoring democracy in Canterbury is to reinstate local body representatives to Environment Canterbury (ECan), a right denied residents since the sacking of the previous council in 2010, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“That could mean an election as soon as 2015.</p>
<p>“My team and I are also committed to working alongside Christchurch’s mayor and councillors to come up with a fair and sustainable solution to the city’s ballooning debt, largely a consequence of a government imposed cost-sharing arrangement.</p>
<p>“There will be no set restrictions on the options that can be negotiated in these discussions.</p>
<p>“Christchurch has been through some extremely tough times. Its people deserve a voice, and they deserve to be listened to. Labour will do that,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
