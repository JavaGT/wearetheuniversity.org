<p><strong>Tuesday, 8 July 2014, 10:25 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Get students thinking for you this summer</p>
<p>Talented students from Victoria University of Wellington will be brainstorming, problem solving and offering creative solutions to a host of businesses and organisations this summer as part of the University’s Summer Research Scholarships Programme.</p>
<p>Each year, the University partners with companies, government agencies and professional groups to provide a 10-week research placement for some of its top performing students, while also helping organisations tackle projects they don’t have the resources to do themselves.</p>
<p>Now in its sixth year, the programme encourages more students to continue on into postgraduate study, by giving them a stimulating and rewarding summer research experience.</p>
<p>Students who have completed at least two years of their undergraduate degree or are studying at honours or first year masters level at any New Zealand or Australian university are eligible to be Victoria summer scholars (students will be required to be enrolled at Victoria for study in 2015 prior to beginning their scholarship).</p>
<p>“These are senior students with sharp brains who can bring a fresh perspective and a whole lot of energy,” says Professor Charles Daugherty, Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Research).</p>
<p>“This is an ideal opportunity for businesses and organisations which have small research projects they want to do, but don’t have time or don’t know where to find a researcher.</p>
<p>“It works for both parties—businesses benefits from our students’ strong research and development skills while the students get a taste of practical problem solving in the workplace.”</p>

<p>An additional major benefit of the programme, says Professor Daugherty, is that it establishes research relationships between Victoria University and external partners that can grow into a long term collaborative research partnership.”</p>
<p>Victoria is offering 300 summer scholarships this year and many of them are available for partnerships with businesses or agencies wanting to get involved in the scheme. The external party pays half the scholarship, or $3,000, with the funds matched by the University.</p>
<p>Summer scholars have expertise in a wide range of areas including science and engineering, humanities and social sciences, commerce, architecture, education and law.</p>
<p>All students have an academic supervisor who works with the organisation and the student to ensure maximum benefit is gained from the research project.</p>
<p>Businesses or organisations interested in hosting a student researcher this summer should email <a href="mailto:summer-research@vuw.ac.nz">summer-research@vuw.ac.nz</a> by 15 August.</p>
