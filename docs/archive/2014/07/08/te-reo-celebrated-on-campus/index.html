<p>8 July 2014</p>
<p><strong>Te reo celebrated on campus</strong></p>
<p>Can you kōrero Māori? If not, July is the month to start as the nation celebrates Te Wiki o Te Reo Māori – Māori Language Week. As part of the celebrations, the University of Waikato is showing full support by running a number of activities for staff, students and the wider community.</p>
<p>The university’s Pro Vice-Chancellor Māori, Professor Linda Smith, says Māori Language Week is an opportunity for staff and students, from beginners to fluent speakers, to embrace and use the language.</p>
<p>“The university has a strong history in language revitalisation, and teaching and research excellence in the te reo Māori space. We are continually making sure that we are providing a culturally rich and diverse experience for all staff and students, and Te Wiki o Te Reo Māori provides us with the avenue to do that.”</p>
<p>On the Monday and Friday of Māori Language Week, the university will be hosting free te reo workshops which are open to the public. On the Wednesday, a public seminar will take place at the university’s Te Kohinga Mārama Marae, featuring Dr Jillian Tipene and Dr Roger Lewis.</p>
<p>Dr Tipene (of Te Rarawa and Ngāti Kahu descent) will be speaking on <em>Te Tuhirau i Rehu i Ringa: He Titiro ki te Whakamāoritanga o Ngā Tuhinga Tawhito (Translating Sacred and Sensitive Texts: An Indigenous Perspective)</em>. Dr Lewis’ topic will cover language revitalisation from an in-depth perspective.</p>
<p>Coffee cards will be distributed amongst staff and students encouraging them to order their coffee in te reo Māori, and a staff <em>Dress Your Space</em> competition will run during the week encouraging staff to label their reception areas, tea rooms and hallways with kupu (Māori words).</p>
