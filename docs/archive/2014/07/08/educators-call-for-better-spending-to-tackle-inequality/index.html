<p>Maori educators call for better spending to tackle inequality</p>
<p>9 July 2014</p>
<p>More than 200 Maori school leaders meeting in Dunedin this week have condemned the government&#39;s failure to invest in real solutions to improve outcomes for Maori students.</p>
<p>The delegates at the Kahui Whetu conference have called for $359m funding set aside for the Investing in Educational Success policy to instead be spent at classroom level.</p>
<p>They pointed to a need for better resourcing of special education, additional support staffing and a reduction in class sizes.</p>
<p>Delegates also spoke of a need to invest in teacher training that gives all teachers cultural skills to work with Maori students.</p>
<p>Speaking to the conference, NZEI Te Riu Roa President Judith Nowatarski said that the government&#39;s investment of $359 million in its Investing in Educational Success policy put money into the pockets of a few teachers and principals but would make little difference to children who are struggling.</p>
<p>Delegates at the conference questioned just how the IES funding would help Maori students.</p>
<p>&quot;Given IES is supposed to raise Maori achievement, why is it not going to directly to tamariki and kaiako Maori?&quot; asked Tiri Bailey, a Resource Teacher of Maori.</p>
<p>&quot;As teachers we rub up against inequality and poverty everyday. The government should be talking with us about solutions instead of adopting untried ideas from overseas,&quot; said Judith Nowotarski.</p>
