<p><strong>Massey students help North Shore men stay healthy</strong></p>
<p>Massey University nursing and dietetics students were out in force recently, helping more than 60 men at a free men’s health check, organised by the Waitemata Primary Health Organisation (PHO) and Age Concern.</p>
<p>The drop-in event at the Northcote Citizens Centre offered a ‘health warrant of fitness’ for men, including heart health, screening for diabetes, a free spot/mole check and a consultation with registered nurses.</p>
<p>Thirteen nursing students organised screening stations for height, weight, BMI and waist circumference, blood pressure and pulse, and blood sugar, while two Master of Dietetics students provided nutritional advice and information.</p>
<p>Senior nursing lecturers Sue Adams and Jenny Green also attended the afternoon, and Ms Adams says the event offered excellent practical experience for the students. “This is such a fabulous opportunity for nursing students to work with the public, alongside experienced registered nurses. The students all expressed how well they consolidated their clinical skills, and enjoyed connecting with a culturally diverse group of men attending the health check.”</p>
<p>Dietetic practice coordinator Reena Soniassy says it was fitting to have two male dietetics students helping with a mens’ health event. “Our students are regularly involved in these events, and it was great to have these young men representing the dietetics profession there.”</p>
<p>Waitemata PHO health promotion services manager Lorelle George says all the the students made a valuable contribution to the day.</p>
<p>“It was really good to have the Massey students involved with our Men’s Health event. They were an excellent addition. We couldn’t have done it without their help.”</p>
