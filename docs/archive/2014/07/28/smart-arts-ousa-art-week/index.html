<p>Smart Arts: OUSA Art Week</p>
<p>Otago University will be home to everything arty this week as the annual OUSA Art Week hosts a wide range of art events around campus and Dunedin.</p>
<p>“Each year we get more interest from both students and the Dunedin public, it’s great to see such a quirky and fun event growing.” said Ruby Sycamore-Smith, OUSA President. “This year we have 213 pieces from 58 artists in the exhibition, and Artist Writer Speed Dating is almost at capacity and will be double the size of last year’s.”</p>
<p>The week has different events happening every day, with the main attraction; the Student Art Exhibition and Sale open to the public and running all week long in the Union Hall.</p>
<p>“Every year the works are new and original, it feels like Christmas when all the works are delivered to the hall for installation!” said Ms. Sycamore-Smith. “However, there is always room for new ideas and projects in the coming years. Next year it would be great to get a street artist to transform one of the buildings on campus, however this project would need a lot of funding.”</p>
<p>Sixteen Dunedin art galleries are taking place in the City Gallery Crawl on Thursday where art lovers have the chance to take a walk around all the galleries which will be open late to show off their works.</p>
<p>There will be five new galleries involved this year and a full list available and downloadable map can be found at artweek.ousa.org.nz</p>
<p>“The City Gallery “Crawl” is always a popular event for students and the public, it helps to celebrate the local arts community.” said Ms. Sycamore-Smith. “This year we have also teamed up with the Hocken Library who will host the official start point at 5pm with refreshments, nibbles and a free shuttle from 5.30-6.30pm running into the CBD.”</p>

<p>Around campus there will also be a number of installations including award winning pieces popping up and making campus spaces even more interesting.</p>
<p>“University is a place for learning and exploring, and this week is about stopping and appreciating art and beauty in many forms.” Said Sycamore-Smith. “Whether you’re looking to start your collection or just take some time to appreciate someone’s work, it’s a great time to find something new that could really affect you.”</p>
<p>The week is proudly supported by long term partners the Blue Oyster Project Space which will be having an opening preview of The Optimists by John Ward and Sophie Bannan on Tuesday the 29th from 5.30pm.</p>
