<p><strong>New law internship is one of a kind</strong></p>
<p>Law students at the University of Waikato will have the chance to work on real cases as part of a new law internship programme – the first of its kind in New Zealand – established between the University’s Te Piringa – Faculty of Law, and the Police Prosecution Service (PPS).</p>
<p>Third- and fourth-year law students, who have completed the third year Crimes paper, are eligible to undertake the internship programme which runs during the University’s summer school period (November to February).</p>
<p>Wayne Rumbles, Senior Lecturer at Te Piringa – Faculty of Law, says the internship provides students with the chance to work on real police cases.</p>
<p>“This programme is unique in that it gives students real hands-on experience with a prosecutor, following a case, including spending time in court, and doing real work and submissions.”</p>
<p>Students in the programme spend six weeks working on a number of cases, under the guidance of a mentor, in a town or city within the central North Island. They then spend another six weeks writing a research paper following on from their case work.</p>
<p>Mr Rumbles says because of the unique opportunity and limited numbers, the internship is highly contested and may be expanded in the future.</p>
