<p>David<br>CLARK</p>
<p>Associate Health Spokesperson</p>
<p>31 July 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Poisons Centre 50 years; celebration or wake?</strong></p>
<p>The Government’s plan to roll a number of helpline services together looks set to proceed with disastrous consequences, Labour’s Associate Health Spokesperson David Clark says.</p>
<p>Latest reports suggest Australian company Medibank is the most likely provider.</p>
<p>“If Medibank wins the contract to supply helpline services, the 0800 Poison Helpline is likely to be put on life support. Its 50th anniversary in December may well turn into a wake.</p>
<p>“Medibank has indicated to existing providers that it intends to cherry-pick the easy helpline calls and refer the more difficult calls - or those from paramedics, ambulance officers and emergency departments - on to the National Poisons Centre.</p>
<p>“That will mean a dramatic reduction in the number of calls fielded by the National Poisons Centre and a reduction in staff numbers.</p>
<p>“A loss of staff will compromise the integrity of the National Poisons database since currently the same experts who update that are the ones who field the calls.</p>
<p>“If the database is not maintained to its present standard, it will become an unviable proposition.</p>
<p>“Otago University currently provides a heavy subsidy to the National Poisons Centre. It is hard to imagine them carrying more cost to support a lower quality model with the risks that represents.</p>
<p>“If the Government doesn’t intervene to remove the Poisons line from the amalgamation, we may end up with both a diminished service and higher costs.</p>
<p>“Every New Zealander has the right to expect timely health advice in an emergency.</p>
<p>“It is best practice to have a stand-alone service and New Zealand would be unique in the western world in doing away with a stand-alone service,” David Clark said.</p>
