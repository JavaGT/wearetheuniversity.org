<p><strong>Otago Volunteer Fair</strong></p>

<p><strong>University of Otago Central Library - The Link</strong></p>
<p><strong>Student Volunteer Fair for Goodness Sake</strong></p>
<p>OUSA and the University Volunteering Centre have joined to present the first annual Volunteer Fair in the University Link as part of a major campaign to raise awareness of volunteer opportunities on campus and in Dunedin.</p>
<p>“The aim is to showcase and elevate student enthusiasm for community engagement through volunteering.” said Kitty Brown, OUSA Project Coordinator. “It’s about giving students a chance to be involved with community and student organisations who are doing great things.”</p>
<p>In a lively fairground atmosphere students will have the chance to sign up to over twenty Dunedin community volunteer-involving organisations such as the Orokonui Ecosanctuary, Riding for the Disabled, and IHC. Student run groups Cancer Core, Choose Kids and Ignite will also be there to talk to students and encourage them to volunteer their time.</p>
<p>Both OUSA and the UVC already have hundreds of student volunteers on their databases and the Fair gives these and other students an opportunity to meet and connect with the organisations offering opportunities.</p>
<p>“We’re keen to raise the number of students volunteering in Dunedin.” said OUSA Project Coordinator Ms. Brown. “At the same time we’re interested in creating a valuable experience for student volunteers - something that will inspire them to develop beyond the possibilities of their conventional studies.”</p>
<p>UVC Coordinator Sze-En Lau said, “Today’s young people have a greater awareness of not just their ability but also their responsibility to contribute to positive social change. Community groups that work with student volunteers love their energy and creative ideas, especially in areas to do with social media and technology. So for goodness sake, come to the Fair and meet your community match!”</p>
