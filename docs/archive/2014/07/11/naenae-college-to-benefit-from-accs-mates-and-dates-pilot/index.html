<p>Naenae College to benefit from ACC’s Mates and Dates pilot</p>
<p>National Candidates Lewis Holden and Chris Bishop welcome the news that local students at Naenae College will directly benefit from being involved in ACC’s Mates and Dates pilot programme against sexual violence.</p>
<p>“This is fantastic news for our community. It’s important our young people learn the skills they need to form healthy relationships based on respect, negotiation, and consent”, says Mr Holden.</p>
<p>&quot;This Government is committed to preventing sexual violence and the physical, mental, and social harm it causes.”</p>
<p>Naenae College has been selected as one of the nine secondary schools to trail the pilot which will see up to 2000 students nationwide taught relationship skills by specialist local facilitators over five weeks. The pilot begins in term three.</p>
<p>&quot;Sexual violence has a massive impact on victims and their families, and this Government is committed to driving lasting change in preventing sexual and dating violence,” says Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>In 2012/13, ACC funded around $44 million towards sensitive claims – all of which related to sexual violence.</p>
<p>&quot;By focusing on the attitudes and behaviours of young people we can reduce the harm caused to our communities by sexual and dating violence,” said Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>The pilot will be funded by ACC and provided by local facilitators. Hutt Valley Youth Health Trust (VIBE) will facilitate Mates &amp; Dates at Naenae College.</p>
<p>The Mates &amp; Dates pilot programme has been developed with input from sexual violence sector representatives, interested community groups, government agencies and specialist academics, along with input from students, parents and teachers.  </p>
