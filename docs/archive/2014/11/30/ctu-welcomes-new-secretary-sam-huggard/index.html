<p><strong>CTU welcomes new Secretary Sam Huggard</strong></p>
<p>The union movement is welcoming newly elected CTU Secretary Sam Huggard who takes office from tomorrow, 1 December 2014, and is paying tribute to outgoing Secretary Peter Conway.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been a highlight of my career to work alongside Peter Conway. Peter has made a tremendous contribution to workers and their unions over almost 40 years and I know he will continue to do great work for the people of New Zealand,&quot; CTU President Helen Kelly said.</p>
<p>&quot;Peter has worked for a number of unions including the Canterbury, Westland, Nelson and Marlborough Clothing Trades Union, New Zealand Distribution Workers Federation, New Zealand Nurses Organisation as well as the CTU. In 2000 Peter came to the CTU as our Economist and Director of Policy, a role he held until his election in 2009 as CTU Secretary. In both roles he has won the respect, support and confidence of all those he has worked with including union members, officials, public servants, employers and politicians,” Kelly said.</p>
<p>&quot;Peter’s contribution has been outstanding and has included providing a strong and credible alternative voice on New Zealand’s economic strategy which recognises that all Kiwis can, and should, benefit from a balanced approach to economic growth. He led our work on the campaign for secure work recognising that despite a 24/7 economy, work and incomes have become very insecure for a huge number of Kiwi workers. Peter was instrumental in the CTU work on industry training. The list of Peter&#39;s contributions is long and extensive,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Helen Kelly said that the union movement is delighted to welcome Sam Huggard as the new CTU Secretary.</p>
<p>&quot;Sam is highly skilled and experienced and I know he will make a valuable and significant contribution to the CTU and represents the next generation of union leaders,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>“I feel incredibly humble and proud that the union movement has elected me as CTU Secretary, &quot; Sam Huggard said.</p>
<p>&quot;Every day unions are making a big difference in improving the lives of their members through supporting workers to win better pay and conditions and respect on the job,” said Huggard.</p>
<p>&quot;I am excited to join the CTU leadership team and I know that I have my work cut out for me. There are many issues I would like to progress, chief among them combating insecure work, protecting strong public services that New Zealanders expect and deserve and the need for a better pay rise for most New Zealanders,&quot; Huggard said.</p>
<p>&quot;I acknowledge the significant work of outgoing Secretary Peter Conway. He is a totara in our movement,” said Sam Huggard.</p>
