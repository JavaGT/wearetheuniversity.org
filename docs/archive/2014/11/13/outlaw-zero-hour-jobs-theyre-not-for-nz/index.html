<p><strong>Outlaw Zero Hour Jobs, They’re Not for NZ</strong></p>
<p>The dreadful British experiment with zero hour jobs is a lesson New Zealand must heed – we don’t want that experience here, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“We call on the government to outlaw these unfair contracts now while it is so focused on tinkering with employment law,” says New Zealand First’s Labour and Industrial Relations Spokesperson Clayton Mitchell.</p>
<p>“Fast food outlets in New Zealand are following their overseas counterparts and adopting ‘zero hour contracts’ where workers have to be available to work, but have no guaranteed hours.</p>
<p>“Zero hour employment has crept into New Zealand and will have devastating financial and social consequences.</p>
<p>“These contracts are despicable and cruel and designed to put workers at the beck and call of their employer. That has nothing to do with a fair society</p>
<p>“Tens of thousands of British workers are denied rental accommodation, because they have no regular hours and reliable income.</p>
<p>“In New Zealand we have a tough employment market where vulnerable workers are left with no choice but to take these contracts.</p>
<p>“The Government touted ‘fairness’ in the workplace when it cut tea breaks but this simply isn’t the case under these contracts.</p>
<p>“The balance may already be shifting too far away from the rights of workers,” says Mr Mitchell.</p>
<p>“The Government needs to stand by its assurances, outlaw zero contracts and fulfil its promise that it is ‘working for all New Zealanders’,” says Mr Mitchell.</p>
