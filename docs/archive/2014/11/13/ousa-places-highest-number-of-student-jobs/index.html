<p>OUSA Places Highest Number of Student Jobs</p>
<p>Otago University Students’ Association is thrilled to have the highest number of Student Job Search (SJS) placements in the country.</p>
<p>In 2013, there were a total of 23,400 SJS placements throughout New Zealand. OUSA had 4158, ahead of Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association with 3916.</p>
<p>SJS is consistently rated by students as one of the top three services that OUSA provides.</p>
<p>Despite the high number of jobs obtained, evidence of students struggling to make ends meet exists. OUSA provides a student Food Bank that is available for students. With 500 food parcels given out each year, there is a strong demand for this service.</p>
<p>“The number of students able to obtain jobs is high, however, many are still searching. In 2015 OUSA is hoping to work with local businesses to improve employment opportunities and develop better support systems for post-graduate students, particularly given the recent cut in post-graduate allowances,” says OUSA President-elect Paul Hunt.</p>
<p>Emergency funds are available through WINZ but OUSA believes they are something that most students do not know even exist and the process to obtain them is not as transparent as it could be.</p>
