<p>Memorandum of Agreement acknowledges important and enduring relationship  </p>
<p>The signing of a Memorandum of Agreement between Kōkiri Marae Seaview and Tū Kotahi Māori Asthma Trust and the University of Otago next week will formalise a relationship that began more than 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Since 1999, health and social services provider, Kōkiri Marae Seaview and Tū Kotahi Māori Asthma Trust have supported research and teaching at the University of Otago, Wellington, particularly helping researchers access Māori communities in the Hutt Valley community.</p>
<p>University of Otago, Wellington’s Associate Dean Māori, Bridget Robson, says the Memorandum is a timely acknowledgement of an enduring and collaborative working relationship that has been critical in ensuring research that is relevant to the Māori community and improves Māori health outcomes.</p>
<p>“University of Otago, Wellington is committed to conducting research that is relevant to Māori communities and leads to positive change. Kōkiri Marae and Tū Kotahi have been crucial partners in our research into key areas for Māori including oral health, housing, cancer and respiratory health. We’re excited about this formal acknowledgment of our relationship, and commitment to future opportunities.”</p>
<p>University of Otago’s Health Sciences Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Professor Peter Crampton, says the occasion will be a celebration of a key relationship that holds exciting opportunities to further strengthen the University’s Treaty responsiveness.</p>

<p>Tū Kotahi specialises in providing asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiolitis programmes to whānau living in the wider Hutt Valley. Tū Kotahi Board Chair Tata Parata says the MOA recognises the significant impact of the longstanding and meaningful relationship between the University of Otago and Tū Kotahi and Kōkiri Marae.</p>
<p>“It also acknowledges our joint commitment to ensuring appropriate processes are adopted when working alongside the Māori community that is being researched. Recent evaluations of Tū Kotahi’s services have recognised the high quality research studies undertaken over the years and the significant positive impact many of these studies have had on the Hutt Valley community.”</p>
<p>The signing takes place at 11am on Monday 17 November at Kōkiri Marae in Seaview. Attendees will include representatives from Kōkiri Marae and Tū Kotahi Māori Asthma Trust, the University, Capital and Coast DHB, Hutt Valley DHB and the community.</p>
