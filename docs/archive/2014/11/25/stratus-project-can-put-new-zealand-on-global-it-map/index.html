<p><strong>STRATUS project can put New Zealand on global IT map</strong></p>
<p>A University of Waikato cyber security research project has the potential to define New Zealand’s ICT industry and have a worldwide impact, a visiting expert says.</p>
<p>Aloysius Cheang is the Asia Pacific Managing Director for the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) and actively contributes to the University’s Cyber Security Lab as a member of its Industry Advisory Group.</p>
<p>He has been in the country giving public talks and having discussions about the ground-breaking STRATUS (Security Technologies Returning Accountability, Transparency and User-centric Services in the Cloud) project, a six-year, $10.6 million Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment-funded project which it is hoped will provide a significant boost to New Zealand&#39;s fledgling cyber security industry, along with creating tools which will return control of cloud-based data to users.</p>
<p>Mr Cheang says the STRATUS project is undertaking a comprehensive scope of cyber security work and “is something that will impact on the industry”</p>
<p>What is important, he says, is that its work is aligned with the rapidly growing cyber security industry.</p>
<p>“It is no good developing all these things if no one uses them.”</p>
<p>“This is an opportunity to define ICT for New Zealand and for a global audience to take notice of New Zealand technology.”</p>
<p>He says the country has the right environmental factors to support tech start-ups and projects such as STRATUS would only reinforce that.</p>

<p>At a speech to students, academics and members of the New Zealand Institute of IT Professionals, Mr Cheang says the cloud is now mainstream and surveys showed there had been a significant decrease in resistance to organisations using it.</p>
<p>“Organisations should adopt a cloud-first strategy when introducing new technology,” he says.</p>
<p>“Agility is one of the main reasons to go to the cloud. Businesses need to be agile.”</p>
<p>He says the CSA was dedicated to building trust in the cloud.</p>
<p>Since being launched in 2009, the CSA now has 60,000 members and 70 chapters worldwide, with 300 member organisations, including AT&amp;T, HP, Google, Microsoft, Dropbox, eBay, Amazon, Alibaba, Trend Micro, Universal Music, Paypal and Standard Chartered Bank.</p>
