<p>Trains Not Cyclists Vital for Gisborne And Hawke’s Bay Renaissance</p>
<p>New Zealand First is challenging the government to show it is serious about regional economic development by backing the Shortline Establishment Group’s advanced plans to re-establish the Gisborne to Napier rail link.</p>
<p>“Both Hawke’s Bay Regional Council and Gisborne District Council are doing what Government should be and that’s putting their regions first by backing the re-establishment of rail,” says Denis O’Rourke, New Zealand First Transport spokesperson.</p>
<p>“It speaks volumes that the Government is pumping $2 billion into commuter rail for Auckland and Wellington but cannot spare a fraction of that to help reinstate rail on the East Coast.</p>
<p>“That said, New Zealand First will support the government in common sense measures and we’re pleased to see it reported that the Shortline Establishment Group is getting better traction from discussions with Kiwi Rail and new Minister of Transport, Simon Bridges.</p>
<p>“There was a lot of spin about the line but the Shortline Establishment Group has found the existing line to be in basically good shape.</p>
<p>“That is very welcome news which could see trains running from Wairoa to Napier by the middle of next year and Wairoa-Gisborne by next December.</p>
<p>“Shortline Rail makes a lot of sense and will help the economic renaissance of Hawke’s Bay and Gisborne.</p>
<p>“In the United States, Short Lines are helping to restore rail connections to thousands of local communities and businesses. Short Lines also reinvest nearly 30 percent of their revenues back into infrastructure like repairing and maintaining track.</p>

<p>“It goes to show that big is not always beautiful when local and lithe can deliver.</p>
<p>“In concert with other projects, like the Ruataniwha water storage scheme, Shortline Rail on the East Coast could help turn the East Coast into the food equivalent of California’s Palo Alto.</p>
<p>“Given today’s immigration figures, we’ve got to give people a reason to live in the regions instead of just building more houses in Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington.</p>
<p>“Of course with the vast amounts going to commuter rail we’d like to see a funding pool created to promote Shortline Rail. Freight may not be as sexy as zipping people to Auckland’s Britomart but to provincial New Zealand it is about jobs and a future.</p>
<p>“That’s why New Zealand First would rather see freight on rail lines rather than a few cyclists on a trail down former rail lines,” Mr O’Rourke concluded.</p>
