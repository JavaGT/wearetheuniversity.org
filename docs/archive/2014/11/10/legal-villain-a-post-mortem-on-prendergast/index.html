<p>Victoria University of Wellington’s Faculty of Law is celebrating the launch of a biography of New Zealand’s infamous and second longest serving Chief Justice, James Prendergast.</p>
<p>The author of <em>Prendergast: Legal Villain?,</em> Dr Grant Morris, says Prendergast was best known for referring to the Treaty of Waitangi as a ‘simple nullity’.</p>
<p>“But during his lifetime, he was a highly respected lawyer and judge. He was arguably New Zealand’s dominant legal professional from 1865 to 1899.”</p>
<p>Acting Chief Justice Sir John McGrath, is launching the book at the Old High Court, where Prendergast spent much of his 24 years as a judge and Chief Justice. Sir John is a particularly apt choice, as he was Solicitor-General before becoming a judge.</p>
<p>Prendergast was Attorney-General for 10 years before becoming a judge, during which time the position was similar to that of today’s Solicitor-General.</p>
<p>“Prendergast’s good reputation began being deconstructed in the 1980s, when the Treaty of Waitangi returned to the centre of political life,” says Dr Morris.</p>
<p>“The more the Treaty has been celebrated, the more Prendergast has been condemned. My book asks the question: Who was this legal villain? Was he really a villain at all?”</p>
<p>Dr Morris is a Senior Lecturer at the Faculty of Law. His research and teaching interests include legal history, law and literature and alternative dispute resolution. He has a particular interest in the New Zealand legal profession from 1860 to 1900. He is the author of <em>Law Alive: The New Zealand Legal System in Context.</em></p>
<p>The biography of James Prendergast was made possible by a grant from the New Zealand Law Foundation.</p>
