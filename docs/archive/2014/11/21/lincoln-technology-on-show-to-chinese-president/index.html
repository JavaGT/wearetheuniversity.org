<p><strong>Lincoln technology on show to Chinese President</strong></p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping was among the dignitaries viewing cutting-edge agri-technology developed at Lincoln University to tackle global issues on his visit to Auckland today.</p>
<p>Lincoln University, and its 100 per cent owned subsidiary company Lincoln Agritech, were part of the Agri-Tech Industry Showcase hosting the President and accompanying Chinese officials, as well as Prime Minister John Key, and Ministers Nathan Guy and Steven Joyce.</p>
<p>Lincoln University Business Development Manager Dr Sam Yu said utilising precision agri-technologies could reduce the consumption of water and dramatically enhance efficient management of natural resources for better food production.</p>
<p>‘’Lincoln University has 136 years of experience in this area and a lot to contribute in this space,” Dr Yu said</p>
<p>“There is much that New Zealand can take advantage of in terms of spearheading efforts to tackle these global issues with a strong partner such as China.’’</p>
<p>“The ability to demonstrate and apply specialist knowledge and turn it into precision agricultural products for uptake is highlighted in the expo, and New Zealand is leading that charge in the world,’’ Dr Yu added.</p>
<p>Lincoln Agritech Chief Executive Peter Barrowclough showcased one of its most successful products, Irricad, a smart software tool able to optimise and generate cost effective and efficient solutions for irrigation and water management systems on vineyards, farms, and even small cities.</p>

<p>He said the software had been sold to over 60 countries, “and we would like to add China to the list.’’</p>
<p>He has just returned from a trip to the Yangling area for the China Agricultural Fair, where he saw the potential benefits of the product for the farmers there.</p>
<p>&quot;There are massive opportunities for Irricad to help local Chinese farmers to reduce their current water consumption by up to five times and increase crop productivity.&quot;</p>
<p>A strong Lincoln University presence was at the event with Vice-Chancellor Dr Andy West, North Island Business Development Manager Tony Moffat, International Operations Coordinator Patrick Yeung, and Professor of Food Science, Charles Brennan also in attendance.</p>
