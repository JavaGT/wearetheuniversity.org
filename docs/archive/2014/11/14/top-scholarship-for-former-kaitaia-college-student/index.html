<p><strong>Top scholarship for former Kaitaia College student</strong></p>
<p>A late night phone call can be a worrying thing for any parent.</p>
<p>But John Bell’s folks Allan and Amanda had nothing to worry about when he rang them at about 11.30pm recently.</p>
<p>The former Kaitaia College student had just learned he had been awarded one of only 10 Golden Jubilee Scholarships to the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think much about it after I had applied but I checked my email about 11pm one night and found out I had got it. I was stoked so I rang my parents at about 11.30pm to tell them. They were both sound asleep,” he says.</p>
<p>The Golden Jubilee Scholarships were awarded as part of the university’s 50th anniversary this year and are worth up to $40,000 each. They have been awarded to students who have demonstrated a high level of academic excellence, leadership potential and community citizenship.</p>
<p>John, who spent his final year of high school at Sacred Heart College in Auckland, will study towards a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) at Waikato.</p>
<p>“I always wanted to be in business,” he says.</p>
<p>“An old boy at school did a BMS at Waikato and he told me about it so we had a look. We looked at scholarships too. I didn’t really think I would have much chance but I wanted to give it a go.”</p>
<p>John – who represented Northland in rugby while at Kaitaia College and was at Sacred Heart on a rugby scholarship - says while he hopes to continue playing rugby at Waikato, his main priority will be study.</p>
<p>“I want to get high grades when I’m there.”</p>
<p>Given what he’s achieved so far, that shouldn’t be too difficult.</p>
