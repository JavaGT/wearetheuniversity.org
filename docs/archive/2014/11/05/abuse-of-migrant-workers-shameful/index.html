<p><strong>Abuse of Migrant Workers Shameful</strong></p>
<p>The government should hang its head in shame for failing the thousands of migrant workers who have been helping rebuild Christchurch, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“The finding that 16 Christchurch hire and construction companies have breached employment laws is appalling,” says New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“When the government issued work visas for so many migrant workers it should have also kept a close eye on their living conditions, their working conditions and their contracts.</p>
<p>“The National government has allowed open abuse of workers’ rights, and only acted after many complaints.</p>
<p>“This has placed great shame on New Zealand and its reputation as a fair and decent society.</p>
<p>“We should not be lowering our standards because these workers are less well-off and are forced to seek work in other countries, away from their homes and families.”</p>
<p>The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s Labour Inspectorate launched an audit of firms in May this year, says Mr Peters.</p>
<p>“This should have been on going from the first day a foreign worker was recruited.</p>
<p>“Sure, we can blame the employers for not keeping to our laws, but the government must take responsibility, as it issued the work visas.”</p>
