<p><strong>Figures show recovery passing many Kiwis by</strong></p>
<p>Rising unemployment in many regions and among Māori and Pasfika suggest the much-hyped economic recovery may have already passed many New Zealanders by, Labour’s Employment, Skills and Training spokesperson Grant Robertson says.</p>
<p>“While it is good news that unemployment overall has fallen, that only benefits those lucky enough to find work.</p>
<p>“Today’s figures pinpoint significant underlying issues in our economy which must be addressed.</p>
<p>“Figures showing 4100 more Māori and 800 more Pasifika are out of work highlights that many are missing out on the so-called ‘rock star’ economy.</p>
<p>“The number of 20 to 24 year olds not in employment, education or training has soared by 3000 in the past three months alone.</p>
<p>“This is the future workforce of New Zealand. It is a huge waste of their talents for these young people not learning or earning. They are facing bleak futures.<br>“The Government must do more to give these young people the skills they need to reach their full potential.</p>
<p>“As well as unemployment rising in most regions and among Māori and Pasifika, long-term unemployment has ballooned by 4700.</p>
<p>“CEOs of partially privatised energy companies are enjoying pay rises of hundreds of thousands of dollars while 43 per cent of workers didn’t get a rise in their wage rates in the past year. Many New Zealanders are rightly asking where their share of the economic recovery is,” Grant Robertson says.</p>
