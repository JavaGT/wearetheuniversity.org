<p>Contact&#39;s big solar buy-back drop bad news for Kiwis with solar</p>
<p>The Green Party are calling for a law change to establish an independent umpire to set fair and reasonable buy-back rates after Contact Energy announced, from today, new small scale solar and wind generators will receive 50 percent less for their exported energy</p>
<p>&quot;New Contact customers exporting small amounts of surplus solar or wind electricity to the grid from today will see their rates reduce from 17c to 8c which is a big drop,&quot; said Green Party Energy spokesperson Gareth Hughes.</p>
<p>&quot;The electricity companies have all the power in setting the terms, contract length and buy-back rate for exporting surplus energy and this decision will greatly increase uncertainty for Kiwi homes going solar.</p>
<p>&quot;It is high time New Zealand established an independent umpire to set fair and non-subsidised rates for surplus energy with greater contract certainty.</p>
<p>&quot;Power prices have risen at more than double the inflation rate since National took office and many Kiwis are looking to gain greater energy freedom by installing solar panels.</p>
<p>&quot;Solar generation has seen a 30 percent increase for the year ending 31 March 2014 and Contact customers planning on investing in solar will be feeling disappointed and powerless from this decision.</p>
<p>&quot;Feed-in tariffs or buy-back rates are the norm in many countries from Australia, Germany and the U.S.</p>
<p>&quot;My Electricity Industry (Small Scale Renewable Distributed Generation) Amendment Bill would empower the Electricity Authority to set a fair and reasonable buy-back rate for the thousands of Kiwis thinking of going solar.</p>
<p>&quot;The Green Party wants to make it easy for families to generate their own clean power and to receive a fair payment for it,&quot; said Mr Hughes.</p>
