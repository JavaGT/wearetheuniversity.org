<p><strong>Tuesday, November 18, 2014</strong><br><strong>Pregnancy survey needs more participants</strong></p>
<p>A research study at Massey University on the dietary habits of pregnant women is urgently seeking more participants.</p>
<p>Good nutrition during pregnancy is essential for both mother and baby, but little is known about what New Zealand women are eating at this vital time.</p>
<p>Master of Human Nutrition student Michele Eickstaedt says 290 women have completed the survey so far, but she still needs at least 160 more pregnant women in their final trimester – of any ethnic background in New Zealand – to do the anonymous online survey.</p>
<p>“We urgently need 160 pregnant women, aged 16 or over, to complete the survey within the next four weeks. This will enable me to then analyse the data and be able to report back in March 2015,” she says.</p>
<p>“We have such scant knowledge about what pregnant women are eating in New Zealand, and whether they are getting enough key nutrients, such as omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in their diets.”</p>
<p>Omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are found in the membranes of every cell of the human body. Their nutritional sources are a range of foods, including meat, poultry, fish, vegetable oils, and some vegetables.</p>
<p>Other studies have reported that modern diets in countries similar to New Zealand do not supply pregnant women with adequate amounts of these vital nutrients.</p>
<p>Dr Cath Conlon, a lecturer in human nutrition and one of the study’s supervisors, says health outcomes are the key. “These fatty acids are essential building blocks for almost every cell in the body. They’re really important for the baby’s brain development and growth, and they’re really important for the mother’s health as well. It’s a double whammy – good for baby, good for mum,” she says.</p>

<p>The study is looking for 450 pregnant women in total.The questionnaire takes 15 to 20 minutes to complete online or on hard copy, which can be posted out by request.</p>
<p>On completion of the survey, study participants will receive a link to the Ministry of Health’s guide <em>Eating for Healthy Pregnant Women</em>, and also go into the draw to win a copy of the book <em>If Only They’d Told Me: Babies, Sex and a Cup of Tea</em>.</p>
<p>Ms Eickstaedt says if participants want to receive a summary of the research findings, they can indicate that when they complete the survey. “This is such important information, and we are grateful to the women who give up their time to take part. Hopefully it will help other pregnant women in the future.”</p>
<p>The survey is available online until 20 December 2014.</p>
