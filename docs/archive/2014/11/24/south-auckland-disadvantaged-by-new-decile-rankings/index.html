<p>South Auckland disadvantaged by new decile rankings</p>
<p>New decile rankings have South Auckland schools at scores that show they are much more disadvantaged than the national average, says Labour’s Associate Auckland Issues spokesperson Louisa Wall.</p>
<p>“As a measurement of disadvantage it is alarming that the average score in South Auckland across the local board areas of Papakura, Manurewa, Mangere-Otahuhu, Otara-Papatoetoe and Maungakiekie-Tamaki was just over 400 compared to the Auckland region’s average score of 234.</p>
<p>“The increases were mostly reflective of a drop in household incomes and reflects the growing issue of inequality.</p>
<p>“NZEI President Judith Nowotarski said recently that National Standards results aligned almost perfectly with schools’ decile ratings and shows that the social determinants of education are by far the biggest factor in educational outcomes.</p>
<p>“The latest recalculation lists the Canterbury region as the least disadvantaged at a score of 166 and Tai Tokerau as the most disadvantaged region at a score of 314.</p>
<p>“Our decile funding system must be more sophisticated to meet the needs of those most in need.</p>
<p>“By contrast, the Government is committed to subsidizing private education through Charter Schools at the expense of existing schools.</p>
<p>“For new Charter Schools to be able to offer free uniforms and stationary will significantly affect the ability of South Auckland schools to match this offer.</p>
<p>“This doesn’t address the issues of disadvantage highlighted by the decile recalculation.</p>
<p>“The government is selling our families and children short by investing in education not based on need but ideology,” says Louisa Wall.</p>
