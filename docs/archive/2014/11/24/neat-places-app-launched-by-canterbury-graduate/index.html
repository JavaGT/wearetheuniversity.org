<p>New Zealand first neat places app launched by Canterbury graduate</p>
<p>November 24, 2014</p>
<p>A University of Canterbury graduate student has produced a nationwide app showing the best cafes, bars, restaurants, shops and events in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.</p>
<p>Marcia Butterfield this week launched the Neat Places website and smartphone app.</p>
<p>``For me, it started as a pipedream after the earthquakes. Now Neat Places (<a href="http://www.neatplaces.co.nz">www.neatplaces.co.nz</a>) is an operation that spans across four cities – Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin and Wellington,’’ Butterfield says.</p>
<p>``I have finally launched my nationwide guide showcasing many of the country’s best neat places after posting the site in Christchurch following the earthquakes.</p>
<p>Neat Places gained a strong following in Christchurch when locals were looking to see what places had opened and relocated. Now it has become a nationwide success. I had no intention of it getting this big, but I’m excited it has. Who knows what the future will hold.”</p>
<p>The new Neat Places website showcases the four cities and the places, people and events that make them unique. These include; fashion, food, nightlife, arts and culture and lifestyle.</p>
<p>``Rather than profiling a corner dairy or fish and chip shop, we’re showcasing businesses that are doing things a bit differently. These are the places people should know about but don’t.</p>
<p>``No other website offers users a curated selection of the best places and events in four major cities. The Neat Places app costs nothing to download and can be used to find businesses and redeem special deals.</p>
<p>``We also put a focus on employing graduates and students around the country to ensure they get valuable paid work experience.’’</p>
<p>Butterfield says nearly 500 places are already listed on the app and the numbers are growing steadily. National magazines are featuring Neat Places and use the website and pocket guides whenever they&#39;re in Wellington or Christchurch.  </p>
