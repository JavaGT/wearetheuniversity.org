<p>Schools standing strong over opposition to education plans</p>
<p>6 November 2014</p>
<p>Primary schools remain strongly opposed to the government’s Investing in Educational Success policy despite strong attempts by the Ministry of Education to sell the policy to them.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu contacted 70 percent of Auckland principals after the September General Election to hear their views about the Government’s IES policy. Fewer than 8 percent said they supported the the IES model.</p>
<p>Auckland Principal, Shirley Maihi, from Finlayson Park School says oppostion amongst principals remains strong.</p>
<p>&quot;From my point of view, the IES represents a lot of money that could better be spent on high needs or at risk students. And I don&#39;t want to see experienced people taken away from my school for two days a week leaving our school in a deficit situation.&quot;</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Judith Nowotarski says the Auckland result is in line with secret ballots held in schools in August, when 93 percent of principals and teachers rejected the policy.</p>
<p>&quot;What we are hearing is that the primary sector want collaboration that is genuine, grass-roots and driven locally by their students&#39; needs, rather than a top-down, one-size-fits all model.&quot;</p>
<p>In the latest results, 63 percent of principals were opposed to the IES while 25 percent were undecided or did not express a view.</p>
<p>Almost half the Boards of Trustees contacted in Auckland were opposed to the IES while another 39 percent were uncertain. Only ten percent of Boards indicated they were in favour of the policy.</p>

<p>Ms Nowotarski says that it’s clear that the changes made to the IES model since the Prime Minister’s announcement in January have done nothing to sway the primary sector.</p>
<p>“Minor changes such as different names of the roles, making release time more flexible and reducing the remuneration to the new roles has not changed the fundamentals of the IES.</p>
<p>The Auckland results are consistent with other regions. A recent poll by the Wellington Wairarapa Primary Principals Association, for example, found 94 percent of principals rejected the policy while only six percent voted in favour of it.</p>
<p>Auckland survey results:</p>
<p>70.5 percent of principals in greater Auckland were surveyed. That&#39;s 282 out of 400 schools</p>
<p>Principals in favour of IES 21 – 7.4%<br>Principals against IES 179 – 63.5%<br>Principals undecided or did not express view 72 – 25.5%<br>Boards of Trustees in favour of IES 30 – 10.6%<br>BOT against IES 138 – 48.9%<br>BOT on the undecided or did not express view 110 – 39%</p>
