<p>6th November 2014<br><em>- for immediate release</em></p>
<p><strong>Vision realised through gift to University</strong></p>
<p>An uncommon act of generosity was recognised at Lincoln University today.</p>
<p>Jim and Diana Howard had wanted for 10 years to have their 400 hectare Westoe farm, in the lower North Island, used to help train the next generation of farmers.</p>
<p>It was something they thought their region sorely needed.</p>
<p>Earlier this year they passed over ownership of the farm to the Lincoln-Westoe trust, set up to administer it, and gave Lincoln University exclusive use of the property to ensure that desire was fulfilled.</p>
<p>Today, to acknowledge their act, they became the first recipients of the new Lincoln University Vice-Chancellor’s Award.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Dr Andrew West called the farm a ‘’gift to the nation’’. He said it would be used for training as well as become a demonstration sheep and beef farm. The old Westoe homestead, with nationally significant gardens, would also be used for horticulture and arboriculture courses.</p>
<p>Mrs Howard said the farm had been in the family since 1884, and while her husband was born there, she had been on the farm for 51 years herself.</p>
<p>Their four children had no interest in taking over the reins and Mr Howard, when a district councillor, had become involved in a think-tank to find ways to revitalise the area.</p>
<p>He said it was slowly losing its population and in danger of becoming like a ‘’zombie town’’.</p>
<p>It had identified a lack of training in the farm sector for young people as an issue, and the idea came to him to use his farm for the purpose.</p>

<p>Mr Howard said until a chance conversation about Lincoln University’s need for a farm in warmer climes for sheep research was relayed to him a couple of years ago they had been hitting hit blind alleys in his efforts to make it a reality.</p>
<p>It had been the start of the process which had culminated in the award today.</p>
<p>‘’We just got lucky,’’ he said.</p>
<p>They had been to ‘’about half a dozen firms and providers’’. None could fulfil their wishes.</p>
<p>‘’We had just about given up.’’</p>
<p>He was glad to have Lincoln University on-board now. ‘’We couldn’t do it on our own.’’</p>
<p>The University’s vision for their farm was ‘’bigger and brighter’’ than they had imagined originally, he said.</p>
<p>He said the gifting was the other way around to the way it was described, as it enabled them to see their hopes realised.</p>
<p>Mr Howard said he would no longer have to worry about fixing the fences at Westoe, but he still did the gardening around the historic homestead, and is a member of the trust, so will be keeping a ‘’close eye on the place’.</p>
<p>The community, and their children, had been very supportive of their idea.</p>
<p>Mr Howard is an alumnus of the University, having done a Kellogg’s Rural Leadership Programme there ‘’many years ago’’, so it was ‘’nice to make that reconnection’’.</p>
<p>Dr West said when the opportunity arose for the farm the University ‘’leapt at it’’.</p>
<p>He described the award as celebrating and recognising the Howard’s ‘’incredible vision for supporting New Zealand and its primary industries’’.</p>
<p>It was a gift to the people, and the University would be custodians of the farm. It was a fantastic opportunity to ‘’provide meaningful pathways to people just leaving school’’.</p>
<p>He said the country did not have a sheep and beef demonstration farm, and it would be ready in less than two years.</p>
<p>‘’It is extraordinary what you have done for the nation,’’ he told the couple.</p>
<p>‘’We have to respect, recognise and celebrate a magnificent gesture.’’</p>
