<p>Leading NZ art figure appointed head of UC fine arts</p>
<p>November 6, 2014</p>
<p>A leading figure in the New Zealand contemporary art community, Aaron Kreisler, has been appointed University of Canterbury’s new Head of the Ilam School of Fine Arts.</p>
<p>Kreisler who takes up his new role in February, has been the curator at Dunedin Public Art Gallery, New Zealand’s oldest municipal art museum.</p>
<p>In his Dunedin role, he produced many key exhibitions including works by Ralph Hotere, who was a guest lecturer and artist-in-residence at Canterbury in 1984.</p>
<p>Kreisler, who has worked at Waikato Polytechnic and Massey University, has established a significant reputation in the New Zealand arts sector over the last couple of decades as a project manager, academic, art writer, critic and curator.</p>
<p>He has edited critically acclaimed books, contributed to public forums and important discussions about contemporary art and been the recipient of a number of major awards, including a Qantas Media Award for best review and best reviewer of the year.</p>
<p>Having worked in numerous roles in a range of institutions, from running small start-up art spaces to working in more established organisations, he has formed a strong understanding of the local and international arts community.</p>
<p>In more recent years this has seen him fostering stronger connections with leading figures in the international art scene, particularly in Asia-Pacific and Europe.</p>
