<p><strong>New opportunities with Chinese universities</strong></p>
<p>An agreement renewed today between New Zealand and Chinese universities will help pave the way for new collaboration opportunities between faculty and students in New Zealand and China including research partnerships, leadership development programmes and staff and student exchanges.</p>
<p>Universities New Zealand (formerly the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’ Committee) and the China Education Association for International Exchange (CEAIE) renewed their Agreement on Cooperation as part of the Joint Working Group meeting in Wellington today.</p>
<p>Professor Harlene Hayne, the Chair of Universities New Zealand and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Otago, says, “This new agreement will provide a framework for New Zealand universities to work more closely with the Chinese. It enables us to grow exciting new opportunities in university teaching, research and leadership for both academic staff and students.”</p>
<p>Universities New Zealand and the CEAIE will also work together to organise the fourth New Zealand China Higher Education Forum, to be held in China in October next year. The Forum will coincide with New Zealand being guest of Honour at their annual conference.</p>
<p>Forum topics have yet to be identified but Professor Hayne says they will focus on areas of mutual strength and in areas where we can help each other.</p>
<p>“New Zealand highly values its relationship with Chinese universities. This new agreement provides the opportunity to strengthen that relationship,” Professor Hayne said. “Collaborations between New Zealand and Chinese universities increase our mutual understanding, globalise our thinking, and provide a wide range of development opportunities for our academic staff and our students.”</p>
