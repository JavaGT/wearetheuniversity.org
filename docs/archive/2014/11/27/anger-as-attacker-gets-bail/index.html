<p><strong>Anger as Attacker Gets Bail</strong></p>
<p>Victims of crime need to be protected from the perpetrator – the victim&#39;s rights should supersede that of the perpetrator, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>&quot;On White Ribbon Day this week, we learnt of a case of violence against a woman going unpunished on grounds of insanity,&quot; says Corrections spokesperson Mahesh Bindra.</p>
<p>&quot;The Papatoetoe woman who was attacked in the street by an architecture student, is being re-victimised by a system that has given the attacker freedom.</p>
<p>&quot;It is unacceptable that the attacker&#39;s rights are more than that of the victim especially when the attacker was already recognised as suffering from a psychotic mental illness.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to do all we can to keep New Zealanders safe, including providing adequate care for those that need it.</p>
<p>&quot;Every New Zealander deserves to live in safety and those that breach it should be suitably punished.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First wants to tighten up parole laws. We want a review of bail and sentencing measures in order to address public concerns and expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government needs to ensure that victim&#39;s rights are paramount and every New Zealander protected,&quot; says Mr Bindra.</p>
