<p><strong>Thursday, 27 November 2014, 12:09 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Young entrepreneurs help create a better New Zealand</p>
<p>New Zealand’s next generation of social entrepreneurs will gather at Victoria University of Wellington this summer for an intensive enterprise accelerator programme called Live the Dream.</p>
<p>The programme supports several early stage youth-led ventures each focused on a social or environmental goal. Following a successful pilot last summer in Wellington, the 10-week programme will be hosted by Victoria’s School of Design and run by Inspiring Stories Trust.</p>
<p>Victoria science students Oliver Bone and Connor Boyle are members of a team that will use the programme to develop the social enterprise aspect of their organisation Grow Aotearoa—a hub that inspires people to care, share and work together efficiently and in an ecological manner.</p>
<p>This will be achieved through a centralised sustainability platform consisting of physical hubs located nationwide and an online hub. “We are working hard to implement simple effective initiatives that uphold the values of environmental sustainability and economic resilience,” says Connor.</p>
<p>The service that Grow Aotearoa will bring through Live the Dream is ‘Permablitz’—a series of community working bees in backyards or public green space that will bring neighbourhoods together to learn about efficient and environmentally sustainable methods of food production.</p>
<p>People will gain skills and resources to create thriving, abundant and easily maintained fruit and vegetable gardens, which will give high yields for very little work says Connor.</p>
<p>“But we aren’t just gardening,” says Connor. “We&#39;re making local organic food fun, exciting and engaging. Our Permablitz’s include awesome live music, shared feasts and quality education from some of the best experts in the country.”</p>
<p>It is free to participate in the programme, which starts on 1 December and involves guest speakers, workshops and mentoring from experts such as Professor Brad Jackson, Head of Victoria’s School of Government, who will advise teams on strategy and leadership.</p>
<p>Viclink, Victoria’s commercialisation office, is also hosting an entrepreneurship bootcamp, sponsored by BizDojo, to support six student teams as they work over the summer to turn their ideas or concepts into viable businesses. Collaborations are being planned with Live the Dream and will kick off later in the programme.</p>
