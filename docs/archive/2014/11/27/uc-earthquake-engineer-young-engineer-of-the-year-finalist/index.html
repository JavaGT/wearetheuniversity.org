<p><strong>Canterbury earthquake engineer a Young New Zealand Engineer of the Year finalist</strong></p>
<p>November 27, 2014</p>
<p>A prominent University of Canterbury engineer, who has tested and researched the impact of earthquakes, is a finalist in the Young New Zealand Engineer of the Year Awards tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Dr Brendon Bradley is an international research leader in several emerging fields of earthquake engineering including the analysis of earthquake-induced ground motions, in particular, during the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes.</p>
<p>Dr Bradley has tested the soil conditions beneath Christchurch and their influence on the earthquakes with the world’s largest vibration truck. He has also led the development of postgraduate research degrees in earthquake engineering.</p>
<p>His international reputation and the importance of his research is demonstrated by more than $2million in research grants he has received over the last four years including international funding from the US National Science Foundation and the Southern California Earthquake Centre (SCEC).</p>
<p>He has investigated the development of seismic hazard analysis and design ground motions for Lyttelton Port of Christchurch (LPC) as part of their $1billion redevelopment.</p>
<p>He has provided expert consultant input in seismic hazard analysis and design ground motions mitigations for several high important projects in Canterbury, including the Christchurch Justice Precinct and the redevelopment of Christchurch Hospital.</p>
