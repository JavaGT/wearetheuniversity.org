<p><strong>Thursday, 27 November 2014, 4:30 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Government Caught Out as Decile Review Reveals Rocketing Rate of Poverty</p>
<p>New Zealand First Deputy Leader and Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin says the latest decile review is telling a story that the government doesn’t want to admit – the appalling rate of poverty in this country.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Education’s figures reveal that next year, 8000 more students will be enrolled in low decile schools compared to this year,” says Ms Martin.</p>
<p>“What it shows is exactly what the teaching profession, the NGOs and New Zealand First has been saying – poverty is real and getting worse for children and families throughout New Zealand.</p>
<p>The response from Education Minister Hekia Parata is that the Government does not know why the recalculation has resulted in an unusual increase in the number of children in low-decile schools. “That beggars belief!” Ms Martin says. “It’s because these families are poor Minister! When will her government accept this reality?”</p>
<p>“New Zealand schools have produced outstanding academic results working in a complex and often underfunded environment and the latest decile ratings should be a wakeup call for the government.</p>
<p>“Mrs Parata has also announced that the government will investigate why this has happened. New Zealand First has the answer.</p>
<p>“Six years of a National government is what has happened to New Zealand and unless this government takes its head out of the sand this issue will only get worse.”</p>
