<p><strong>Thursday, 27 November 2014, 1:44 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University">Massey University</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Wednesday, November 26, 2014</strong><br><strong>Under embargo until 10.30pm (NZ time), November 26</strong><br><strong>Peter Schwerdtfeger awarded Rutherford Medal</strong></p>
<p>A world-leading authority in quantum chemistry and physics, Massey University’s Distinguished Professor Peter Schwerdtfeger is this year’s winner of New Zealand’s most prestigious science award, the $100,000 Rutherford Medal.</p>
<p>Professor Schwerdtfeger, originally from Germany, has been based at the University’s Albany campus since 2003. He is the seventh Massey scholar to be selected by the Royal Society of New Zealand to receive the award in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>“Distinguished Professor Peter Schwerdtfeger is one of New Zealand’s most brilliant and internationally sought-after scientists,” the Rutherford Medal selection panel says.</p>
<p>“His research has provided a deep insight into how atoms and molecules interact at the quantum level.”</p>
<p>Professor Schwerdtfeger works on fundamental aspects of chemical and physical phenomena in atoms, molecules and condensed matter. His approach to science is truly interdisciplinary, ranging from chemistry to physics, computer science and mathematics.</p>
<p>He says he is honoured to receive the Rutherford Medal.</p>
<p>“Rutherford, for me, is one of the giants in science. He’s in the same category as Einstein, Dirac, Schrödinger, and Heisenberg. When I went through school and university, the name Rutherford was everywhere. There’s the Rutherford atomic model, and there’s Rutherford scattering — and of course he was the first one to split the atom, and he discovered the proton. So the name — the person — Rutherford, means a lot to me. In that sense, I’m honoured.”</p>

<p>Born in Stuttgart, Germany in 1955, and now a New Zealand citizen, Professor Schwerdtfeger spent his early years studying subjects that interested him.</p>
<p>“I came out of school and didn’t know what to do, so I thought ‘maybe I’ll study chemistry’ so I went into chemistry, and then I did mathematics and physics – and because there were no student fees in Germany, you could study as long as you wanted. So I studied until I was 30, and by then I probably had four or five degrees.”</p>
<p>For seven years, while he was studying, he drove taxis at night to cover his living costs, finishing his final shift the day before he flew to New Zealand to take up a new position. He credits that experience with giving him a broader view of the world.</p>
<p>“I could write a book about my experiences, from taking a 14-year-old prostitute off the streets and putting a pimp behind bars, to saving people’s lives. It’s amazing what you experience as a taxi driver.”</p>
<p>This rich life experience may also have influenced the approach he has taken to his diverse research interests, which range from theoretical chemistry and physics, to computer science and mathematics, with applications in materials science, environmental chemistry and physics, high-pressure physics, atomic, molecular and solid-state physics, including quantum electrodynamic effects and electroweak interactions, thermodynamics of melting processes, and graph theory with fullerene structures.</p>
<p>He has had papers rejected from respected journals because the processes they outlined were deemed revolutionary, and the referees did not believe the results. These are now his most-cited papers. He has published more than 290 papers in international journals and books. His current h-index stands at 47 and he is the most highly cited chemist and physicist in the country at his age. His diverse interests in science are reflected in the different themes chosen in the seven Marsden grants he has received over the last 15 years.</p>
<p>Professor Schwerdtfeger is a passionate advocate for the role of fundamental and applied sciences in New Zealand universities.</p>
<p>“Basic, or fundamental science, is science for science’s sake. There are so many things we don’t understand in physics, chemistry and biological sciences, like how did we get the first molecules of life? Applied science is really important to me too. How can we solve the global warming problem, or the energy crisis we will face in the future?”</p>
<p>In 2013, he and a team of researchers including Dr Elke Pahl from Massey University solved the long-standing problem of why mercury is the only metallic element that is liquid at room temperature. Through calculations and computational simulations, they showed this is due to Einstein’s special relativity. Without this effect, the melting point of mercury would be 82C not -39 as observed.</p>
<p>Massey University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says Professor Schwerdtfeger epitomises Massey’s strategy of helping shape our nation and taking the best of New Zealand to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>“My warmest congratulations to Peter. He has proudly represented Massey University and New Zealand on the world scientific stage for many years. He has won numerous accolades for his inspirational work and, in taking out this year’s Rutherford Medal, he follows in the footsteps of many of Massey University’s finest scientists.”</p>
<p>Deputy Vice-Chancellor and College of Sciences Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Robert Anderson describes Professor Schwerdtfeger as “extraordinarily talented” and says his Rutherford Medal is “richly deserved”.</p>
<p>He has received many international grants, awards and prizes, including a James Cook Fellowship and the Hector Medal in 2001, the Alexander von Humboldt Research Prize and the Fukui medal in 2011, an elected fellowship into the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Sciences in 2012 (which restricts membership to 100 scientists worldwide, including a number of Nobel prize winners). He was made a Distinguished Professor in 2012.</p>
<p>Although he has received many offers to work overseas, Professor Schwerdtfeger says New Zealand is his home. “I’m very happy here. My kids didn’t want to leave, and my wife is also happy here. I have a research centre (the Centre for Theoretical Chemisty and Physics) here with a team that are absolutely world class. We’ve got top people who regularly publish in top international jounals. I think we are quite unique in this country.”</p>
<p>Distinguished Professor Schwerdtfeger is the seventh Massey alumnus to receive the Rutherford Medal in the past ten years. Previous Massey alumni recipients include: Distinguished Professor Margaret Brimble (former staff member, 2012), Professor Christine Winterbourn (graduate, 2011), Professor David Parry (staff member, 2008), Professor Edward (Ted) Baker (former staff member, 2006), Professor Sir Paul Callaghan (graduate, former staff member, 2005) and Professor David Penny (staff member, 2004).</p>
