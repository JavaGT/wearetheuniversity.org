<p><strong>Key shouldn’t take New Zealand to war</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister John Key should not seek to involve New Zealand in a conflict with the Islamic State, Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said today.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Key signalled this week that a New Zealand commitment to a campaign against the Islamic State in the Middle East could be for a long time, and pointed to the ten-year deployment of troops in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“New Zealand should not be dragged into an overseas conflict by John Key and our top military brass that there is no need to be involved in,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
<p>“Prior to the election, John Key played down the possibility that he would involve New Zealand in a Middle East conflict.</p>
<p>“Since the election however, the Prime Minister’s words and actions point towards his Government involving New Zealand in a conflict against tens of thousands of Sunni militants who control large swathes of Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>“There is no doubt that the Islamic State threat is a very real one to the people of Syria and Iraq, but that does not mean New Zealand should have any military involvement.</p>
<p>“At present there is an urgent need for humanitarian assistance as a result of the crisis in Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>“To assist the suffering of those involved in this conflict New Zealand can consider taking more refugees from this part of the world.</p>
<p>“We could do far more good by providing shelter and aid money to those displaced by conflict than joining a so-called global coalition against the Islamic State,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
<p>“John Key should not sign New Zealand up to a war where we don’t know what the exit strategy is or how participating could affect New Zealand’s own security.”</p>
