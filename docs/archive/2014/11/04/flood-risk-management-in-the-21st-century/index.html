<p><strong>The more we know, the more we don’t know: Flood risk management in the 21st century</strong></p>
<p>How do societies manage uncertain environmental risks? Why is flooding so hard to manage? And how can we make water proof buildings?</p>
<p>Professor Iain White, from the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, is an international expert in the field of environmental planning. His work takes an interdisciplinary perspective that aims to better understand the nature of environmental problems and how they can be addressed.</p>
<p>In his upcoming inaugural professorial lecture ‘<em>The more we know, the more we don’t know: Flood risk management in the 21st century’</em>, Professor White will provide insights into the difficulties in managing the risk of flooding and the new approaches to keeping water out of buildings.</p>
<p>“My work has been predominately conducted within large collaborative projects that include multiple disciplines and span national boundaries,” says Professor White.</p>
<p>He has been awarded research funds totalling over $2.5m from a variety of sources, including the European Union, various government departments and national research bodies, the private sector and the Asia Pacific Network.</p>
<p>“My most recent project has involved researching the possibility of making houses resilient to flooding, from the materials used, to the institutional barriers, to the views of residents. The project involved seven different countries and resulted in new national guidance written in partnership with government, industry and citizens,” he says.</p>

He holds a degree in Geography, a masters degree in Town and Country Planning and a PhD in Environmental Planning.</p>
<p>Professor Iain White’s inaugural professorial lecture ‘<em>The more we know, the more we don’t know: Flood risk management in the 21st century</em>’, will be held on Tuesday 18 November at 6pm in the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts. The lecture is free and open to the public. Inaugural Professorial Lectures are the University’s way of presenting new or newly promoted professors to the wider public.</p>
