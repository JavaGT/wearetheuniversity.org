<p><strong>Marsden funding success for Victoria researchers</strong></p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington researchers have received 25 prestigious Marsden Fund grants worth $12.1 million, the largest number ever received by the University.</p>
<p>The Marsden Fund supports research excellence, allowing New Zealand’s most talented researchers to explore ideas at the forefront of their disciplines. The Fund is administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand on behalf of the Government.</p>
<p>Victoria University researchers received 21.9 percent of total Marsden funding, securing 25 out of the 101 research projects funded nationwide (an increase from 21 awarded grants in 2013). The Victoria funding consists of 16 Standard grants and nine Fast-Start grants for researchers early in their careers.</p>
<p>Projects awarded funding range from research into security intelligence, vaccine development and sea ice to black holes, Māori legal traditions and solar cells.</p>
<p>In the humanities, nine projects in total were approved for Marsden Fund support with eight of those awarded to Victoria researchers (two of three Fast-Start grants and all six Standard grants) which, says Professor Deborah Willis, Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences, is an outstanding achievement.</p>
<p>“This success provides further evidence of the quality of Victoria’s established and early career researchers and of the humanities in general,” she says.</p>
<p>Other successful Victoria researchers include 13 staff in the Faculty of Science, two in the Faculty of Law, and one each in the Faculty of Engineering and Victoria Business School. There are also a number of researchers involved in Marsden funded projects led by other organisations.</p>

<p>Victoria University Provost Professor Neil Quigley says the results are confirmation of Victoria’s national leadership in a large number of fields, and of the outstanding quality of its academic staff.</p>
