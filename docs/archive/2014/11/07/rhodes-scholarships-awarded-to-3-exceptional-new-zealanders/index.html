<p><strong>Rhodes Scholarships awarded to three exceptional young New Zealanders</strong></p>
<p>Three outstanding young New Zealanders have been awarded a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship to undertake postgraduate study at the University of Oxford. The announcement was made by the Governor-General, Lt Gen The Rt Hon Sir Jerry Mateparae at Government House today.</p>
<p>The successful Rhodes Scholars elect are:</p>
<p><strong>Finn Lowery</strong>, 24, attended Auckland’s Rangitoto College and is currently studying towards his Bachelor of Laws with Honours/ BA at the University of Auckland. At Oxford he will study for his Masters of Public Policy in criminal justice and state security and their connection with social justice, which is his key area of interest. Finn worked as a legal intern for the UN International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague. He represented New Zealand as a member of the Men’s water polo team and coached junior teams.</p>
<p><strong>Hadleigh Frost</strong>, 19, attended Lincoln High School in Canterbury and is currently studying towards his BSc (Hons) at the University of Canterbury. At Oxford he will study for a Doctor of Philosophy in condensed matter physics (valuable for immediate applications to society such as computing, solar energy and medical scanning), exploring the theory of gravity and the missed mechanics that gauge theories and our attempts to quantise them. In 2012, Hadleigh won the inaugural Eureka! Sir Paul Callaghan Award for young science orators. He enjoys teaching and is a contributing editor for a student-led magazine.</p>
