<p><strong>Monday, 3 November 2014, 11:09 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Putting music research to educational use in the Pacific</p>
<p>BD-inFSMA lecturer from Victoria University of Wellington’s Te Kōkī New Zealand School of Music (NZSM), will use his research as an educational tool for local communities in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM).</p>
<p>Using sound recordings of traditional music, speeches, and stories from his previous and current research, Dr Brian Diettrich will help develop new resources.</p>
<p>“Music is integral to cultural identity, tradition, and heritage. This focus has generated a huge outpouring of commentary internationally,” says Dr Diettrich.</p>
<p>With the new resources and technology, students in Chuuk—one of the four states of the FSM—will develop a greater understanding and appreciation of local music and culture.</p>
<p>“Most schools in the region do not have resources to bring indigenous culture into classrooms, so projects like this in partnership with a local centre allows us to engage students with local knowledge.”</p>
<p>While Chuuk has a number of challenges in its educational system, including limited technology and resources, Dr Diettrich is hopeful that recent initiatives will allow him to make cultural content available for students.</p>
<p>“The technology will also enable us to connect with other schools in Chuuk, which is really helpful given that the state is comprised of 41 islands.”</p>
<p>These resources will be used in the new cultural centre and school currently being built in Chuuk, a community Dr Diettrich has been involved with for the past 15 years.</p>
<p>Dr Diettrich has seen an increased focus by Ethnomusicologists with making a difference and putting their research to use in the communities in which they work.</p>
<p>With a longstanding commitment to connecting research to educational outcomes in the Pacific, Dr Diettrich has previously taught as a music lecturer in the FSM, and recently has been working with the Akoyikoyi (‘Dawn Chorus’) Centre in Chuuk.</p>
<p>While in the FSM, Dr Diettrich will present aspects of his current research to students and staff at the College of Micronesia, which provides tertiary education in the nation.</p>
