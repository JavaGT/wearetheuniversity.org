<p><strong>No Dinner For Some War Veterans</strong></p>
<p>Some Kiwi war veterans cannot afford to put food on the table every day, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>The plight of war veterans has been raised yet again by New Zealand First with spokesman for Veterans’ Affairs Andrew Williams giving details in Parliament today.</p>
<p>While asking questions in the House, Mr Williams revealed that some veterans at the Mosgiel RSA, in Otago, can only afford to eat every second day and they are receiving food parcels.</p>
<p>“Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Michael Woodhouse, who lives in the area, responded that he would give specific cases his attention -I will hold him to account on this.</p>
<p>“As New Zealanders we must surely cringe when people who served their nation overseas are now struggling with everyday life.</p>
<p>“It is about time this Government stepped up and offered support.</p>
<p>“We have previously called for the Government to take up the case of veterans whose claims for extra allowances for disabilities have been denied.</p>
<p>“As has been pointed out they have been turned down because past records have been lost or misplaced.</p>
<p>“I hope that with the Minister’s promise to look at specific cases this will mean many vets will receive the allowances they are due,” says Mr Williams.</p>
