<p><strong>New Adam Art Gallery show connects histories of cinema and painting</strong></p>
<p>The interaction between major figures from the history of cinema and important contemporary artists lies at the heart of the Adam Art Gallery’s upcoming show at Victoria University of Wellington.</p>
<p><em>Cinema &amp; Painting</em> is a visually stunning exhibition that rethinks connections between film and painting. It proposes a history for cinema that links it to painting by identifying features both mediums share: colour, light, implied and real motion, and the play between flat surfaces and projective space.</p>
<p>Inspired by the PhD research of curator Michelle Menzies and developed with Daniel Morgan, a professor of film studies at the University of Chicago, the exhibition is the Gallery’s contribution to the 2014 New Zealand Festival programme.</p>
<p><em>Cinema &amp; Painting</em> features an international group of pioneering filmmakers—the Lumière Company (France), Jim Davis (USA), Oskar Fischinger (Germany), Len Lye (NZ/UK/USA), Hollis Frampton (USA), and Ken Jacobs (USA)—and historically significant artists such as William Fox (UK/NZ), Colin McCahon (NZ), and Anthony McCall (UK/USA). These are brought into play with a newer generation of artists, represented here by Judy Millar (NZ/Germany), Phil Solomon (USA), Diana Thater (USA), and Matt Saunders (USA/Germany).</p>
<p><em>Cinema &amp; Painting</em> offers unique opportunities to see historical gems, such as Len Lye’s suite of card stencils and Colin McCahon’s Fog drawings.</p>

<p>The exhibition also premieres a number of contemporary works including new work by Judy Millar, whose 3-D digital ‘paintings’ represented New Zealand at the 53rd Venice Biennale in 2011.</p>
<p>Curators Menzies and Morgan believe this exhibition is especially important given the digital revolution that has transformed the practice of, and our relationship to, image-making.</p>
<p>“We are trying to construct a history that brings together artists from different geographical locations and timeframes to establish a tradition that will make sense of our current moment.</p>
<p>“Digital processes in all kinds of image making have created ever more fluid and flexible surfaces and spaces. This exhibition sketches out a past for these practices in a way that lets us understand where they have come from and where they could go.”</p>
<p>The exhibition will be accompanied by a public programme, including talks by artists Judy Millar and Diana Thater, and rare film screenings.</p>
