<p><strong>Independent Taskforce to tackle education red tape</strong></p>
<p>ACT Leader John Banks welcomed today’s [<em>3 Feb</em>] announcement of an independent taskforce to tackle red tape in education.</p>
<p>“This taskforce is provided for in ACT’s Confidence and Supply Agreement with National. I am grateful to Hekia Parata for her support for a taskforce that can actually make a difference.” Mr Banks said.</p>
<p>“School leaders have said to me that they spend too much time on compliance. If they could spend less time on red tape they can spend more time on their students. ACT is keen to help.</p>
<p>“The Chair, Murray Jack leads an outstanding group of New Zealanders. They are some of our best thinkers on regulation, governance, and education.</p>
<p>“As Member of Parliament for Epsom, I am pleased that Tim O’Connor the Headmaster of Auckland Grammar has agreed to serve.</p>
<p>“This team has the potential to make life easier for other educational leaders and that is good for students.</p>
<p>“I am committed to seeing five out of five of our students succeeding. This taskforce can help achieve that objective.” Mr Banks said.</p>
