<p>Phil Twyford<br>Housing spokesperson</p>
<p>4 February 2014</p>
<p><strong>Govt housing segregation a mistake</strong></p>
<p>National has made a mistake with the Canterbury residential rebuild by segregating expensive and low-cost housing, says Labour&#39;s housing spokesperson Phil Twyford.</p>
<p>“The Government&#39;s announcement of a new 11.5 ha, 275-dwelling development at Hornby will concentrate low-cost housing in one development, while allowing a massive sprawl of expensive housing elsewhere in Christchurch.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour welcomes any sensible move to address the Christchurch housing crisis. But this is far too little.</p>
<p>&quot;After five years of leaving it to the market they are panicking over affordable housing now an election is around the corner. But this doesn&#39;t deal with the underlying problems driving rents and house prices through the roof. Their housing policy is a complete shambles.</p>
<p>&quot;Pepper potting is a classic Kiwi approach to housing but now mixed-income developments are international best practice. They work better socially and economically. They don&#39;t concentrate disadvantage but instead build healthier and more diverse communities.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s hands off approach has seen huge new residential development on the fringes of Christchurch but most of it is unaffordable to ordinary Cantabrians. Now they are panicking about the housing crisis as the election looms. Nick Smith has a rush of blood to the head and wants to build an estate made up entirely of low-cost housing.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour will take a more hands-on approach, ensuring mixed income communities, like that planned for New Brighton&#39;s revitalisation. Labour has also committed to building 10,000 affordable starter homes in Canterbury over four years.&quot;</p>
