<p><strong>Thursday, 6 February 2014, 11:31 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>A petition launched yesterday by Dunedin North MP David Clark was signed by more than 100 people in its first hour.</p>
<p>The MP says the petition gives everyday people a chance to support Invermay. He has appealed to Steven Joyce to listen to Otago and Southland.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce hasn’t listen to the appeals to save Invermay. He indicated that he is seeking more feedback but has received several detailed reports showing the flaws in the proposed restructure. If he won’t listen to them he should listen to the people of Otago”, David Clark said.</p>
<p>“The more the case is examined, the more it unravels. People are increasingly concerned the Government has a tin ear for the regions.</p>
<p>“Invermay is a real touchstone. For the sake of both regional and national interest, I hope Steven Joyce will put ideology to one side and examine the facts in this case.</p>
<p>“Experts inside and outside the organisation agree that the Invermay part of AgResearch’s restructure proposal doesn’t best achieve their strategic goals. Strengthening capability on the existing site at Mosgiel is a superior approach.”</p>
