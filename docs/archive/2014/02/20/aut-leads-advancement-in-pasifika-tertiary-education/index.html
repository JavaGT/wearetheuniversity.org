<p><strong>Thursday, 20 February 2014, 6:02 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/AUT">AUT</a></strong></p>
<p>AUT University has appointed Walter Fraser to the position of Head of Pasifika Advancement with effect from 14 April 2014.</p>
<p>The Head of Pasifika Advancement provides strategic advice and leadership to advance initiatives across the University that build on our growing success of Pasifika in education, employment and ethical and cultural understanding.</p>
<p>AUT has the highest number of tertiary Pasifika students in New Zealand studying Health, Information Technology and is the largest provider of Pasifika Business Studies. A particular priority is to transition more Māori and Pasifika students into Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). A major development is the AUT South Campus to meet this growing demand, in fact the largest tertiary demographic (school leavers aged 20-24) in NZ will be from South Auckland.</p>
<p>Walter will be joining AUT from the University of Auckland where he has held the positions of Director of the Centre for Pacific Studies and most recently, Director of Pacific Strategy and Engagement. He previously held the position of Registrar at the University of the South Pacific (USP) in Fiji. Walter graduated from the USP with a Bachelor of Arts in History, Politics and Administration, and has a post-graduate Diploma in Commerce.</p>
<p>As Head of Pasifika Advancement, Walter will play a key role in AUT continuing to build effective relationships with Pasifika communities and other key external stakeholders. Walter will also be working in partnership with AUT faculties and divisions to further encourage the access, success and advancement of Pasifika staff and students.</p>
