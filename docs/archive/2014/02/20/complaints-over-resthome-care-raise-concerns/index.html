<p>Complaints Over Resthome Care Raise Concerns</p>
<p>The issue of abuse of elderly residents in rest homes is a deep-seated problem, says New Zealand First, and the Government is not doing enough.</p>
<p>Spokesman for Health Barbara Stewart questioned Associate Minister for Health Jo Goodhew in Parliament after reported complaints over lack of care in Waikato and Coromandel rest homes.</p>
<p>“While the Minister said these complaints had been followed up swiftly we are concerned that she is not taking an overall view of the situation in rest homes.</p>
<p>“Indeed, she disagreed that lack of regulation and staffing intensified problems, instead staying it was not numbers but quality of care that counts.</p>
<p>“Yet the New Zealand Nurses’ Organisation says the industry lacks regulation and the Service and Food Services Workers’ Union believes lack of regulation and staffing are problems.</p>
<p>“The Minister should not be ignoring the views of organisations that have so many members working within the industry.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First will be watching to see if the new national clinical assessment tool the Minister speaks about leads to a healthier environment for our elderly,” says Mrs Stewart.</p>
