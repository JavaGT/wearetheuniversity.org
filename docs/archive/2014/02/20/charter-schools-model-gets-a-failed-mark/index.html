<p><strong>Charter Schools Model Gets A ‘FAILED’ Mark</strong></p>
<p>A Northland school, misled and let down by the backers of charter schools, is now struggling with the outcome, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>Spokesperson for education Tracey Martin says New Zealand First has sympathy for Te Kura Hourua O Whangarei Terenga Paraoa, the new Partnership School in Whangarei as the school appears to have been misled by the Government and the ACT Party.</p>
<p>“This school was known for the fabulous work they did with students who were disconnected from mainstream schooling. It enjoyed a close working partnership with other local schools.</p>
<p>“But the backers of charter schools seduced them and rushed them through the process to become a charter school.</p>
<p>“Now the school has discovered the so-called benefits fall well short of their expectations.</p>
<p>“They have also learned that as a charter school, set up by the National Government to bring competitive tension into education, they cannot expect to utilise other public education facilities.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First recognises the frustration for school’s seeking more flexibility and believes the legislation needs a rethink and indeed Te Kura Hourua O Whangarei Teranga Paraoa was considering this when they were pushed toward the new model.</p>
<p>“A re-write of the legislation around the special character provisions is the avenue the Government should have taken instead of sinking millions of dollars into the charter school model.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First will work with all stakeholders to stop this ridiculous competition which takes the focus away from the very students we are trying to assist,” says Ms Martin.</p>
