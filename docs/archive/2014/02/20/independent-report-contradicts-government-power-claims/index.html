<p><strong>Independent report contradicts Government power claims</strong></p>
<p>An independent report commissioned by the Government has delivered a body blow to claims that switching power companies means cheaper power, says Labour’s Energy spokesperson David Shearer.</p>
<p>“The report by Covec says consumer switching has a small effect on the level of competitiveness and ‘no significant effect’ on retail prices.</p>
<p>“That is completely at odds with what Energy Minister Simon Bridges has been crowing about for the past few months.</p>
<p>“All of this just confirms what Kiwi consumers already know - that their power prices continue to go up. Switching power companies may have short term impacts but it won’t fix a system that is dominated by power companies who want to maximise their profits.</p>
<p>“Simply tracking the cheapest electricity suppliers charges shows there were massive increases between February 2011 and February 2014 .</p>
<p>“The overall increase across the nation was $243 with Northland ,Taranaki, Nelson and Otago topping the list with increases of over $400 .</p>
<p>“The Electricity Authority is supposed to be the watchdog on power prices. They told a Select Committee ‘rising prices is not a good measure of whether a market is competitive or not.’</p>
<p>“If a competitive market is not about bringing down prices ,what is it for?, David Shearer says.</p>
