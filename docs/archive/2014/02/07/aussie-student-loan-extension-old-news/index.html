<p>CUNLIFFE</p>
<p>Labour Leader</p>
<p>7 February 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Aussie student loan extension old news</strong></p>
<p>John Key has got nothing out of his bilateral meeting with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott but a re-announcement of a previous Government’s decision on student loans, Labour Leader David Cunliffe says.</p>
<p>“John Key has tried to claim a win out of his meeting with Tony Abbott today in the form of agreement to extend student loans to children of New Zealanders who are long-term Australian residents.</p>
<p>“He is taking the New Zealand public and media for a ride. This decision was reached by the previous Labor Government in Australia and was announced in June. Murray McCully even welcomed it in a <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1306/S00176/australia-extends-student-loans-to-nz-residents.htm">press release</a> at the time.</p>
<p>“There has been no movement on the crucial areas of social welfare for New Zealanders in Australia, who are still treated as second class citizens.</p>
<p>“John Key has re-heated an old announcement in a desperate attempt to save face,” says David Cunliffe.</p>
