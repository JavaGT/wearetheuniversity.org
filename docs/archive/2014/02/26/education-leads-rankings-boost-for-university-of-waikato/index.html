<p><strong>Education leads rankings boost for University of Waikato</strong></p>
<p>A good start to the year for the University of Waikato has been given a significant boost with five subject areas assessed as being among the best in the world.</p>
<p>Of the five, four are ranked from 101-150 while Education claims a place among the top 50 in the world, with a ranking of 46.</p>
<p>The other subjects to receive a high ranking in the QS Subject Rankings are Computer Science and Info Systems, Economics/Econometrics, Law and Modern Languages.</p>
<p>It is the first time Modern Languages has featured in the rankings while both Economics/Econometrics and Education have improved their ranking on last year.</p>
<p>The QS Subject Rankings, released this week, assess 800 universities on the quality of 30 different subject areas.</p>
<p>They are generally considered among the most influential of university ranking systems and are based on academic and employer surveys, research citations for each subject area, the ratio of students to staff and the number of international students and staff at the university.</p>
<p>Aside from the subject rankings, the QS University Rankings and Times Higher Education (THE) rankings both place the University of Waikato in the top two percent of universities in the world. THE also ranks the University of Waikato as 46th best university under 50 years old.</p>
<p>The rankings come on the back of the University’s 50th anniversary celebrations this year, the final year it is eligible for inclusion in the best young universities rankings.</p>

<p>University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says the results are an acknowledgement of the hard work of staff in the subject areas and reflect a focus on continued improvement.</p>
<p>The Faculty of Education, in particular, has always been highly regarded and the global rankings have confirmed the quality of education within the faculty, he says.</p>
<p>“We are a young university but we are making a significant impact globally and that impact is now being acknowledged. However, we are not resting on our laurels and will continue to improve on what is already a world-class education at the University of Waikato.”</p>
