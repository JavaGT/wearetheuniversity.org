<p>Joyce’s arrogance can’t hide flawed reforms</p>
<p>Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce’s arrogant dismissal of criticism about his cuts to student, staff and community representation on university councils can’t hide a vindictive, ideological policy, Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Grant Robertson says.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce said on radio this morning that if he is upsetting so many people he must be getting something right on university governance.</p>
<p>“This kind of breath-taking arrogance can’t cover for that fact the policy is deeply flawed and does not have support in the community.</p>
<p>“The legislation proposed by the Minister is not being endorsed by most universities and our two biggest universities – Auckland and Otago – oppose the policy outright.</p>
<p>“Universities value having broad representation that reflects the community they serve. Steven Joyce has simply dismissed their views.</p>
<p>“The best he can say is that smaller councils will make quicker and better decisions. Yet there is no evidence to support his claim. If it were true, I look forward to the Minister proposing a reduction in the size of Cabinet from eight to twelve.</p>
<p>“This policy is based on ideology without evidence. It applies a narrow, outdated view of what is good governance that is not relevant to universities.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce is simply dealing to his critics by shutting them out of representation. Such high-handed dismissal is sadly becoming the Minister’s trademark,” Grant Robertson says.</p>
