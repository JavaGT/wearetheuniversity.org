<p><strong>Connecting with China by degrees</strong></p>
<p>A new initiative to encourage Chinese computer science students to study in New Zealand has won funding from the International Education Growth Fund held by Education New Zealand.</p>
<p>The funding, announced by Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Steven Joyce today will help increase the number of Information, Commmunication and Technology graduates and open the door for Chinese students to carry on with postgraduate studies in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Assistant Vice-Chancellor Operations, International and University Registrar Stuart Morriss says winning the funding is recognition of Massey’s standing and reputation in international education. It is is directly in line with the Government’s plans to boost New Zealand’s international education industry too, he says.</p>
<p>The programme will see students studying a four-year Bachelor of Information Science at Hebei University of Technology (HEBUT) spending their final year of study at Massey University. Over the first three years of their degree Massey lecturers will teach a range of degree-specific papers at HEBUT in English. Students will then complete their final year in New Zealand and will graduate with a Massey University degree.</p>
<p>“We have been working closely with HEBUT in Tianjin since 2008 to develop a new co-learning experience that benefits both countries, “ Mr Morriss says.”This initiative will enable Massey academics to work in China with prospective students before they come to New Zealand, and also enhance the students’ English skills before they come to New Zealand to complete their degree.”</p>

<p>Head of the School of Engineering and Advanced Technology (SEAT) Professor Don Cleland says the Bachelor of Information Science is the perfect place to start the programme, as multi-lingual ICT graduates will be in even higher demand as trade relations with China continue to strengthen.</p>
<p>“SEAT is excited by the opportunity to work with our Chinese partners, to explore combined delivery of ICT education to Chinese students,” he says. “Funding from Education New Zealand to support this development is greatly appreciated. If successful, this initiative will help address the skills shortage in NZ ICT businesses, will strengthen collaboration with China, and will contribute to internationalisation of Massey’s offering.”</p>
<p>Massey staff will travel to Tianjin in March to work through operational and logistical details, and it is expected that the first intake of students will commence in August 2014.</p>
