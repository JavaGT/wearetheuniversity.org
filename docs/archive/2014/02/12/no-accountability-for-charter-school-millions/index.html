<p>Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>12 February 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>No accountability for charter school millions</strong></p>
<p>Education Minister Hekia Parata needs to assure New Zealanders that charter schools can’t double-dip by claiming funding for their students and pass on the cost of their learning to state schools, Labour&#39;s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>“Hekia Parata confirmed today that charter schools will be able to ask existing state schools to teach kids on their behalf. However she couldn&#39;t say whether those charter schools will be required to reimburse the state schools for the cost of those lessons.</p>
<p>“Why should charter schools be allowed to claim funding for education the taxpayer has already paid for?</p>
<p>“The Government is throwing millions of dollars of taxpayer money at charter schools but the Minister doesn&#39;t seem to know or care how that money is being spent. That&#39;s just not good enough.</p>
<p>“It gets worse. If a charter school closes before the end of its contract, there is no provision for the taxpayer to recover the money it has already received in establishment costs.</p>
<p>“It’s just sloppy for the Minister to dish out millions for something she isn’t guaranteed she will actually receive.</p>
<p>“These schools are being funded at a much higher rate than existing state schools. One charter school is receiving funding per student five times that received for the average state school student.</p>
<p>“Hekia Parata should be able to answer the most basic questions about what that money is being spent on,” Chris Hipkins says.</p>
