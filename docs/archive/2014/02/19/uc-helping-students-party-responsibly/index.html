<p><strong>UC Helping Students Party Responsibly</strong></p>
<p>February 18, 2014</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury (UC) is committed to being a good neighbour to its local community and making sure that students are safe.</p>
<p>It has become a principal partner in a project titled “Good One”, a joint initiative to help deliver safer communities and minimise alcohol harm.</p>
<p>UC is working alongside the Accident Compensation Corporation, Police, the Health Promotion Agency, Canterbury District Health Board, Lincoln University, Lincoln University Students’ Association and the University of Canterbury Students’ Association.</p>
<p>The “Good One” campaign is a Canterbury party register and is designed to work with students to find out how they can be responsible party hosts and register their party with the Police.</p>
<p>The project aims to reduce alcohol related incidents and harm, increase access and distribution of information to enable the public to self-manage parties, and reduce disorderly behaviour.</p>
<p>Local police are supporting the new initiative. Riccarton Neighbourhood Policing Team’s Sergeant Steve Jones says the register provides a great opportunity for police to work constructively with students and the local community.</p>
<p>``Our experience has been that the majority of students are very receptive to information and support to help them ensure parties are safe.</p>
<p>``Planning ahead and identifying risks can make all the difference between a great celebration and one that hits the headlines for all the wrong reasons,” Sergeant Jones says.</p>

<p>UC Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says that the initiative is a tangible step forward in addressing the concerns of the public and neighbours.</p>
<p>``Ninety-nine percent of our students are well engaged community citizens. For that tiny minority who may cause problems, we are helping by giving them the tools to become better community citizens.</p>
<p>``We aren’t trying to stop students from enjoying themselves, but if they do want to socialise we want them to do it in a safe and responsible manner.</p>
<p>``This is also another tool we are giving to the community and will enhance and improve the positive relationships we have with our neighbours,” Dr Carr says.</p>
