<p><strong>Wednesday, 19 February 2014, 11:48 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sign Up To Help Labour Guarantee A Voice For Students</strong></p>
<p>As students around New Zealand arrive at university for orientation, the Labour Party is urging them to join a campaign to keep their voice on university councils.</p>
<p>“The National Party is removing the right of students, staff and other community groups to be represented on university councils,” Labour’s Tertiary Education Spokesperson Grant Robertson says.</p>
<p>“It follows the Government’s introduction of voluntary student association membership and is a further silencing of students who have been vocal critics of National’s policies.</p>
<p>“Labour is making a commitment to students that when we are elected to government we will ensure they are represented on university councils and have strong student associations.</p>
<p>“We believe having those who are involved in learning and teaching on the governing bodies of universities is a good thing and adds value to the decisions being made.</p>
<p>“Starting today at Otago University orientation week, we are asking students to sign up to a petition opposing National&#39;s attempts to silence students’ voices.</p>
<p>“We will be at every university over coming weeks to give students the chance to oppose the university council changes and make a submission against the legislation Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce plans to introduce.</p>
<p>“A strong response from students to National&#39;s proposals will send a powerful message that they will not accept their voices being silenced,” Grant Robertson says.  </p>
