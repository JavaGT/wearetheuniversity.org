<p><strong>New writing showcased in <em>Turbine</em></strong></p>
<p>Poetry, memoir and a tribute to artist Ralph Hotere feature in the 2013 issue of the online literary journal <em>Turbine</em> which is published by Victoria University’s International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML).</p>
<p><em>Turbine 13</em> showcases writing from established and emerging voices, including the latest graduates of the IIML’s Master of Arts in Creative Writing.</p>
<p>This year’s highlights include American poet Mary Ruefle’s <em>Long White Cloud</em>, which was inspired by her visit to New Zealand as an IIML international guest writer, and former IIML director Emeritus Professor Bill Manhire’s tribute to Ralph Hotere titled <em>Some Things to Place in a Coffin</em>.</p>
<p><em>Turbine</em> also features an extract from the first memoir to win the Adam Foundation Prize, Helena Wiśniewska Brow’s <em>Give us this day,</em> which will be published by Victoria University Press in October this year. The memoir tells the story of a Polish child who arrived in New Zealand in 1944.</p>
<p>There is also poetry from Iowa Writers’ Workshop graduate Sara Martin, who is currently convening a poetry workshop at the IIML.</p>
<p>An interview with 2013 Victoria University Writer in Residence Carl Shuker and extracts from the reading journals of last year’s MA in Creative Writing graduates, give fascinating insights into the writing process.</p>
<p>Among the previous contributors to <em>Turbine</em> is IIML graduate Eleanor Catton, whose novel <em>The Luminaries,</em> won the 2013 Man Booker Prize.</p>
