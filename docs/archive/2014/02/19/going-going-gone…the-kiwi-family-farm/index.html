<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters<br>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>19 February 2014</p>
<p><strong>Going Going Gone…The Kiwi Family Farm</strong></p>
<p>Young New Zealand farmers are a threatened breed as the foreign takeover of New Zealand land marches on, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“To allow one foreign company to buy 29 farms is a sin,” says Rt Hon Winston Peters, in reference to the sale of 13 Synlait Farms in Canterbury to a majority-owned Chinese company which was also allowed to buy the 16 Crafar farms.</p>
<p>“This is not foreign investment, it is the transfer of Kiwi wealth in wholesale quantities.</p>
<p>“Many of our family farms are disappearing. Young would-be farm owners are being priced out of ownership as foreigners are allowed to buy-up blocks of farms in one go.</p>
<p>“This Government clearly favours foreign ownership over ordinary New Zealanders and their dreams of doing well on the land.</p>
<p>“It is not a fair go for New Zealanders. There is no reason why these farms could not have been sold individually giving Kiwis a more competitive chance at ownership.</p>
<p>“It is false economics to suggest these sales can be of substantial benefit to New Zealand when profits will be channelled overseas.</p>
<p>“There’s an important point here too about guardianship of the land.</p>
<p>“No foreign owner understands our land as a Kiwi farmer does, and has done for decades. They have worked hard to improve their land and their farming know-how and the farms have passed through generations.</p>
<p>“The end of the treasured Kiwi farm, as the backbone of the economy, is nigh unless we say no to more farm sales to non-resident foreigners,” says Mr Peters.</p>
