<p><strong>UC aims to be one of the two universities in NZ long-term, QS says</strong></p>
<p><strong>February 27, 2014</strong></p>
<p>The University of Canterbury&#39;s overarching goal is to be among the top two universities in New Zealand over the long-term, says London-based QS rankings, which annually ranks more than 3000 universities in the world.</p>
<p>QS has just announced its rankings by subject which rates Civil and Natural Resources Engineering at the University of Canterbury (UC) 19thin the world.</p>
<p>It says in its latest global report that UC wants to reach standards equivalent to comparable Australian universities in research, teaching and learning and secure and maintain a ranking in the top 250 universities worldwide.</p>
<p>``The University of Canterbury enjoys an international reputation as a university that has a distinguished heritage, embraces and extols traditional values of academic excellence and takes singular pride in its strong research culture,’’ QS says.</p>
<p>``The University -  Business and Economics, Education, Engineering and Science and School of Law - is located in attractively landscaped grounds in the suburb of Ilam, 10 minutes’ drive from the city centre and an international airport.</p>
<p>``Lecture theatres, research centres, libraries, laboratories, studios, computer workrooms, halls of residence and a host of other student services and facilities are all located on campus.</p>
<p>``The University has an impressive profile in research, learning and advanced scholarship as is evidenced by its strong performance in recent Performance-Based Research Fund exercises.</p>

<p>``This fuels the University&#39;s resolve to continue with strong contributions to fundamental and applied research, with well-regarded postgraduate and research programmes and with strong research and collaborative links with other leading tertiary institutions and research organisations, nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>``The University&#39;s teaching programmes represent a heritage of solidly-grounded basic disciplines in the laboratory sciences, commerce, education, engineering, field sciences, forestry, humanities, information and communication technology, law, life sciences, social sciences and visual and performing arts.</p>
<p>``While reflecting a keenly felt university responsibility for stewardship of knowledge and providing regional access to a broad range of programmes, these generic disciplines are also foundational to the development of specialist teaching and research programmes in interdisciplinary fields and postgraduate study.’’<br>UC features among the world&#39;s elite (top 200) universities in 16 subjects in the latest QS world university rankings by subject.</p>
<p>Out of 3000 universities, UC is rated in the top 100 in History, Civil and Natural Resources Engineering, Geography, Law and Education.</p>
<p>UC is listed among the top 200 in Linguistics, Computer Science and Information Systems, Chemical Engineering, Psychology, Communication, Statistics and Operational Research, Modern Languages, Mechanical Engineering, Earth and Marine Sciences, Environmental Sciences and Sociology.</p>
<p>UC is currently ranked among the top three percent of universities in the world and is the only New Zealand university with a five star QS rating.</p>
