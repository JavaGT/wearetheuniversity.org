<p><strong>Everyone benefits from international students</strong></p>
<p>The value of international students to the regional and national economies has been highlighted in a new economic impact report.</p>
<p>The report, by consulting economist Dr Warren Hughes, covers the economic impact of the University of Waikato for 2013 and clearly illustrates the importance of tertiary institutions attracting international students.</p>
<p>The report shows that each international student enrolled at the University of Waikato generates $90,000 in annual sales revenue somewhere in New Zealand, with 77% of that revenue generated in Hamilton or the neighbouring Waipa and Waikato district council regions.</p>
<p>And every two international students studying for one year generates a job somewhere throughout the country, the report says.</p>
<p>“The 2543 international students currently studying at the University generated 1257 jobs somewhere in the New Zealand economy, with 894, or 71% of these jobs located in the Core Waikato area.”</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says the report shows just how important it is for New Zealand universities to continue to attract international students.</p>
<p>“We pride ourselves on how we look after our international students and a recent international survey showed more than 90% were happy with the Waikato experience,” he says.</p>
<p>“Aside from the economic benefits outlined in this report, international students contribute to the excellence of our research, teach us about other cultures and contribute to the diversity of the region.”</p>

<p>International students at Waikato generated $228.5 million for the New Zealand economy in 2013 with about half that figure from personal student spending on things such as living expenses, entertainment and recreation.</p>
<p>In total, international students provide nearly $87 million in regional GDP to the core Waikato region each year.</p>
<p>The report shows the University of Waikato is a “significant player” and “extremely important,” to the region’s economy, generating just under $800m in sales revenue for Waikato firms.</p>
