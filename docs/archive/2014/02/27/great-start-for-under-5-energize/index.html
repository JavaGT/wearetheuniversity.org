<p><strong>Great start for Under 5 Energize</strong></p>
<p>Pre-schoolers in the Coromandel electorate are benefitting from a new healthy nutrition and activity programme developed with $1.1 million of government funding, says Coromandel MP Scott Simpson.</p>
<p>Sport Waikato has used the money to create an Under 5 Energize Team to work alongside local early childhood centres to improve activity levels and food awareness. Around 130 childhood centres across the region are benefiting including facilities in Thames, Waihi, Ngatea and Paeroa.</p>
<p>“Health Minister Tony Ryall has already heard from teachers who have seen a marked difference in the types of food coming in with the children. Teachers at one school are now making platters with all the fruit coming in for all the kids to enjoy,” Mr Simpson said.</p>
<p>The Under 5 Energize programme was introduced as an extension to the wider Project Energize programme already running in Waikato. It’s part of the government’s ‘Healthy Families NZ’ strategy.</p>
<p>“Studies have shown this programme has resulted in fitter, healthier children who weigh less, run faster, and have a better handle on healthy nutrition than the national average. By extending the programme to our youngest kids we can develop those habits even earlier.”</p>
<p>“I would like to congratulate the staff, management and parents at childcare centres in the Coromandel for embracing this project as part of their curriculum,” said Mr Simpson.</p>
