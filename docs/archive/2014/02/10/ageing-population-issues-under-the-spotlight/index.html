<p><strong>Monday, 10 February 2014, 10:50 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Ageing population issues under the spotlight</p>
<p>The challenges brought by an ageing population will be the focus of a series of presentations to be hosted at Victoria University’s Institute for Governance and Policy Studies this month.</p>
<p>Professor Simon Biggs, Professor of Gerontology and Social Policy at Melbourne University, will speak about the creation of ‘age friendly’ workplaces and the value of older workforces, based on research conducted for the World Economic Forum. He will also focus on the damaging effects of ageism and abuse of the elderly, as well as offering insights into a new Australian research initiative into the social aspects of dementia.</p>
<p>“The challenge of population ageing is not simply a demographic shift; it also requires cultural adaptation to a situation that is historically unprecedented,” says Professor Biggs.</p>
<p>Professor Biggs will address how social policies can adapt to this challenge and ways that sustainability can be built across generational lines.</p>
<p>Professor Biggs has worked all over the world, including Trinity College Dublin and Harvard University. His work in the field of ageing is wide-ranging, including research on age-friendly cities and workplaces, the baby boom generation, and uses of adaptive technology in later life.</p>
<p>Before moving to Australia in 2010, Professor Biggs was Professor of Social Gerontology at Keele University and Director of the Institute of Gerontology, King’s College London. He has a number of continuing international links and has participated in European Union, Australian and Canadian government briefings on population ageing, dignity in later life and elder protection.</p>
