<p>Phil</p>
<p>TWYFORD</p>
<p>Auckland Issues Spokesperson</p>
<p>10 February 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Get with the programme Mr Key</strong></p>
<p>Len Brown’s offer to kick start the City Rail Link is a no brainer and the Government should grab it with both hands, Labour’s Auckland Issues spokesperson Phil Twyford says.</p>
<p>“The Mayor is only reflecting a desire by Aucklanders to see the rail project up and running as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“National’s refusal to move on the City Rail Link until 2020 is holding back Auckland’s growth and prosperity.</p>
<p>“Aucklanders know the project will double the number of trains on the network and unlock huge development in the central city.</p>
<p>“Precinct Properties, the owner of the Downtown centre, are even offering to start digging the first section of tunnel themselves.</p>
<p>“What would it take to get the Prime Minister to say yes? A working bee with thousands of Aucklanders hand-digging the tunnel with picks and shovels?</p>
<p>“If the Government has said it will fund the project 50:50, and Auckland Council is willing to front load its share to get it started, what is the downside for the tax payer?</p>
<p>“John Key and his Government will be a distant memory by his preferred start for the project of 2020.</p>
<p>“If he refuses to budge on this, then you have to wonder whether his high profile flip flop on the City Rail Link was more about political expediency than a genuine commitment to the project.”</p>
