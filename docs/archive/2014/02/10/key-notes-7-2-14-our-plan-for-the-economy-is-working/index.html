<p><strong>Key Notes: Our plan for the economy is working</strong>  </p>
<p>This week we welcomed some great news on the economy, and I visited Waitangi before departing for Australia to meet with Prime Minister Tony Abbott.</p>
<p>In Sydney today <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-25845.link">I welcomed confirmation</a> that long-term New Zealand residents in Australia would now have access to the Higher Education Loan Program for students.</p>
<p>At the Trans-Tasman Business Circle, Prime Minister Abbott and I spoke about New Zealand&#39;s close relationship with Australia and the importance of building a strong economy to create jobs and growth.</p>
<p>Household Labour Force Survey employment data released this week showed that our plan for the economy is working.</p>
<p>In the past year, 66,000 more people were employed - the strongest annual rise since 2006. Employment rose by 24,000 in the December quarter alone. Unemployment has dropped to 6.0 per cent, and is lower than in most OECD countries.</p>
<p>Our welfare reforms are also working. On average, 1500 people each week have been supported off welfare and into work since the reforms began. National&#39;s plan is to help more New Zealanders move from welfare into independence, and it&#39;s great to see this making a difference.</p>
<p>Wages are rising faster than inflation.</p>
<p>Unemployment for both Māori and Pasifika is down.</p>
<p>The rate for youth not in employment, education or training is the lowest since March 2009. There are 16,000 more 15-24 year olds in employment, education, or training than there were a year ago.</p>

<p>After several years of hard work, through the global financial crisis and the Christchurch earthquakes, New Zealand families are looking to the future with optimism.</p>
<p>While we are moving in the right direction, as a country we need to remain focused on encouraging investment, jobs, and growth.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
<p><strong>John Key<br>Prime Minister</strong></p>
