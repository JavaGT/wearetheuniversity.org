<p><strong>Bay benefits</strong></p>
<p>Benefits to the Bay of Plenty from a downtown campus in Tauranga could be massive, with the University of Waikato already pumping more than $8 million and 40 jobs into the region’s economy.</p>
<p>That’s from the 836 students studying in the Bay of Plenty in 2013 and the latest economic impact report into the University’s operations show student spending adds more than $8 million in value added (wages for employees, profits for business and taxes for government) to the region.</p>
<p>The actual figures are likely to be higher still, with the report assuming all Tauranga students live at home.</p>
<p>“This almost certainly underestimates the direct Tauranga impacts since some Bay of Plenty students will, in fact, live away from home,” the report says.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says the Bay of Plenty is an important part of the University.</p>
<p>“This report shows we are making a strong contribution to the Bay of Plenty,” he says.</p>
<p>“We are committed to the region and expect our presence in the Bay of Plenty to grow, providing more benefits for residents, students and the regional economy.”</p>
<p>Plans for a downtown campus in Tauranga are well developed and in August 2013, the Bay of Plenty Regional Council approved funding of up to $15 million to support the initiative.</p>
<p>The Bay of Plenty Tertiary Partnership was formed in 1998 by the University of Waikato and the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic. They were joined by Whakatane-based Te Whare Wānanga o Awanuiārangi in 2010 and Waiariki Institute of Technology from Rotorua in 2013.</p>

<p>The economic impact report, by consulting economist Dr Warren Hughes, shows overall the University of Waikato generated $938 million in revenue for the New Zealand economy in 2013, up from $860 million in 2012. This figure is expected to exceed $1 billion within two years.</p>
<p>The University generates more than 5200 jobs nationally and currently adds $474 million to the national GDP annually.</p>
