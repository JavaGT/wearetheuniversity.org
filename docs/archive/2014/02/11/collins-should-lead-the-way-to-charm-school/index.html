<p><strong>Tuesday, 11 February 2014, 1:50 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Judith Collins should lead by example and take herself off to the charm school ACC staff are being asked to attend, Labour’s ACC spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway says.</p>
<p>ACC has hired Auckland University of Technology to provide training and study for staff as part of a move to improve service delivery, build trust and confidence and enhance its reputation as “an employer of choice”.</p>
<p>“Ms Collins needs look no further than to herself to understand why staff development has become an issue.</p>
<p>“ACC’s cavalier and ruthless approach towards its clients is symptomatic of the leadership from its Minister.</p>
<p>“Given that the attitudes of staff reflect those at the top it is only right Judith Collins familiarise herself with the etiquette expected of the workers.</p>
<p>“Some $2 million has already been spent on consultants in an effort to fix the Corporation’s image. This latest scheme has so far cost $1.66 million.</p>
<p>“ACC has a bad reputation and fixing that will take a lot of work. But the answer doesn’t lie in wasting ACC levies on consultants and courses.</p>
<p>“It lies in putting a stop to home support cuts for injured Kiwis, not blocking legitimate claims, investing in prevention programmes and treating people fairly and with dignity.</p>
<p>“Labour is committed to repairing the damage National has done to ACC by focussing on providing fair treatment and fair compensation in return for fair levies.”</p>
