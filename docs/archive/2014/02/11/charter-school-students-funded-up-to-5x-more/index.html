<p><strong>Tuesday, 11 February 2014, 3:04 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Chris Hipkins<br>Education Spokesperson</p>
<p>11 February 2014</p>
<p><strong>Charter school students funded up to 5x more</strong></p>
<p>The Government is so desperate to ensure its controversial charter schools are a success, students are being funded at a rate up to five times the average of state school students, Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>“State and integrated schools received an average funding per student of about $7000 but charter schools receive funding of up to $40,000 per student. <em>(See details below)</em></p>
<p>“A hand-full of children are being funded at a much greater rate than the bulk of Kiwi kids.</p>
<p>“Education Minister Hekia Parata today failed to justify to Parliament why the Government is creating this inequality.</p>
<p>“Charter schools are deeply unpopular and there is no evidence to show they improve learning.</p>
<p>“Yet the Government is throwing money at them in an attempt to boost their chances of success.</p>
<p>“There is no doubt every state and integrated school in the country could dramatically improve their students’ results if their funding was increased to match that given to charter schools.</p>
<p>“Where is the value for money Minister?</p>
<p>“A Labour government would scrap charter schools, axe National Standards and end this Government’s war on teachers,” Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p><strong>Charter Schools receive up to 5 times the funding for state schools</strong><br>• Charter schools are receiving up to $40,000 per student in 2014 compared to average funding of around $7,000 per year for students in state and state integrated schools.<br>• Charter schools are guaranteed the same level of funding regardless of the number of students they enrol, unlike state schools who face funding cuts on a quarterly basis if their roll drops.<br>• Charter schools are guaranteed annual funding increases based on the CPI and Labour Cost Index, unlike state schools who aren’t guaranteed any annual funding increases.</p>
