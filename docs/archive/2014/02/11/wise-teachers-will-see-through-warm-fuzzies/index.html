<p><strong>Wise Teachers Will See through Warm Fuzzies</strong></p>
<p>Teachers are too wise to be deceived by the Government’s repeated attempts to curry favour with them says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>Deputy Leader and Spokesperson for education, Tracey Martin, says a government website hosting students’ memories of teachers who made a difference is just another attempt to make teachers feel good towards the Government.</p>
<p>“It is a cynical attempt to win the teacher vote, following years of attacks on the public education system.</p>
<p>“In an election year the Government suddenly wants to kiss and make up - expect to see more of these warm fuzzies towards teachers.</p>
<p>“Already they have found a massive $359 million of new money for bonus payments for a select few ‘lead’ teachers. What else will be used as election sweeteners?</p>
<p>“For the past five years the National Government has been beating up on dedicated professionals who go into schools each day and do their best for our kids.</p>
<p>“Time and again the Government has criticised teachers saying they are not being held to account for education outcomes, and they don’t care enough.</p>
<p>“How much of the education dollar was spent on this cynical attempt to now raise the morale of teachers they are guilty of demoralising in the first instance?</p>
<p>“Interestingly, the Government is sweet talking our education professionals as three Charter Schools open – schools which have no requirement to have fully registered teachers,” says Ms Martin.</p>
