<p>National selects Alfred Ngaro as Te Atatu candidate</p>
<p>The National Party has announced that Alfred Ngaro will be its candidate for the Te Atatu electorate at the 2014 General Election.</p>
<p>Mr Ngaro was selected by a meeting of local party members tonight.</p>
<p>“Alfred has been tireless in representing Auckland’s diversity, ensuring that all communities have a strong voice in Government. His experience makes him an outstanding candidate, and he will be a great representative for Te Atatu if elected in September,” said Northern Regional Chair Andrew Hunt.</p>
<p>“National won the party vote here last time and we’ll be working hard to do it again by getting all our supporters in Te Atatu out to vote.”</p>
<p>“I also want to thank Tau Henare for his dedication to the electorate as a List MP over the past nine years.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ngaro said he was honoured to receive the nomination and was looking forward to the challenge ahead.</p>
<p>“It’s incredibly humbling to be chosen to contest the seat for National and Te Atatu’s communities,” said Mr Ngaro.</p>
<p>“Under John Key’s leadership, this National-led Government is delivering real opportunities for West Aucklanders.</p>
<p>“We’ve been focussed on bringing more jobs and better public services to the region, and I am committed to ensuring that Te Atatu has a strong local voice in National at the election.”</p>
