<p><strong>Agreement opens doors</strong></p>
<p>Up to 40 additional Indonesian students could be benefitting from studying at the University of Waikato following the signing of a significant agreement in Jakarta recently.</p>
<p>On 15 May the University signed an agreement with Indonesia’s Ministry of Education and Culture which opens the door for up to 20 Indonesian postgraduate and 20 doctoral students to study in Hamilton.</p>
<p>The agreement was signed by University Chancellor, the Rt Hon Jim Bolger, Professor Supriadi Rustad from Indonesia’s Directorate of Higher Education, and Indonesia’s Minister of Education and Culture Mohammed Nuh.</p>
<p>University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says the agreement will bring long term benefits to both Indonesia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>“This is a significant partnership for the University of Waikato. We are increasingly focusing on our connections with ASEAN countries and Indonesia plays an important role in the Asia-Pacific region. It also aligns with our strategy to implement a comprehensive programme of internationalisation and will help us attract top quality students.”</p>
<p>The signing took place during a successful trip by a multi-disciplinary delegation from the University of Waikato, headed by Mr Bolger, Professor Crawford, faculty deans Professor Roger Moltzen (Education), Professor Bradford Morse (Law), and Professor Geoffrey Holmes (Computing and Mathematical Sciences) and South East Asia International Market Manager Elle Freestone.</p>
<p>While in Indonesia, the delegation also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Airlangga University and hosted an alumni event in Jakarta, attended by more than 100 people, to mark the University’s 50th anniversary. It was attended by about 60 alumni and friends.</p>
