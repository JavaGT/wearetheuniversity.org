<p><strong>Polytechnic financial results a National embarrassment</strong></p>
<p>Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce should hang his head in shame following the dismal financial results of our polytechnics, Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Maryan Street says.</p>
<p>“It is unsurprising that three years into a four year funding freeze, the finances of polytechnics are deteriorating.</p>
<p>“All but one of our institutes of technology and polytechnics are reportedly in worse financial shape than they were a year ago. Twelve out of a total of 18 reportedly failed to make the 3 per cent surplus required by the Government, and three of those ran deficits.</p>
<p>“Our tertiary institutions are being asked to do more and more with less and less.</p>
<p>“Over the past five years the Government has sucked more than $60 million out of institutes of technology and polytechnics. This comes at the same time as enrolments are falling.</p>
<p>“The pressure on our polytechnics is unsustainable. We cannot expect them to continue to exist on this current flawed business model. These institutions need help.</p>
<p>“If the Government is serious about filling skills gaps in our economy, then it should be looking to boost polytechnics and the courses they offer rather than consistently cutting them back.</p>
<p>“National should be supporting polytechnics so they become significant contributors to regional development. But unfortunately the regions have been left to wither and die under this Government.</p>
<p>“Labour will restore polytechnics to their previous role in skills development which maximises their regional opportunities and contribution to regional economic development,” Maryan Street says.</p>
