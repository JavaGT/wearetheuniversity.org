<p>Canterbury graduate carrying out artificial intelligence research at Stanford University</p>
<p>June 2, 2014</p>
<p>A University of Canterbury graduate and Fulbright scholar is carrying out substantial artificial intelligence research at Stanford University, looking at how robots make visual sense of the world.</p>
<p>PhD Student Sam Corbett-Davies has begun a wide-ranging thesis to see how robots learn about objects by watching humans use them. Speaking from Stanford, Corbett-Davies says his goal is to create a system that constantly watches YouTube videos, learning more and more about millions of objects as it observes humans interacting with them.</p>
<p>``We acknowledge we&#39;ll never be able to ship a robot that already knows about every object it will encounter. It will have to adapt to things it hasn&#39;t seen before. A natural way for a user to teach a robot about a new object is by demonstration, so we are trying to develop a system that allows this.</p>
<p>``This work could allow a household robot to learn to operate your dishwasher, or play Lego with your kids. The opportunities at Stanford are immense. This year I&#39;ve taken a class with Andrew Ng, founder of the Google Brain project, and sat in on research meetings with Sebastian Thrun, who led the development of the self-driving car and founded Google X, the Google lab behind the self-driving car and Google Glass.</p>
<p>``Stanford is a pretty incredible place, located in the heart of San Francisco’s Silicon Valley surrounded by Google, Facebook and Apple. Almost every day a big tech company is on campus to recruit students, start-ups are everywhere, and Stanford alumni won two Nobel prizes in the first month I was here.</p>
<p>``Unlike many of my peers I haven&#39;t been drawn into a start-up company, but I plan to intern at Google or Microsoft next summer. I will be here five or six years during which I&#39;ll work on around four projects which I will tie together in my thesis. I may return to Canterbury to lecture.</p>
<p>``I&#39;m really excited to see the emphasis the University of Canterbury and Christchurch have put on technology and innovation during the rebuild. It&#39;s a culture thing - I don&#39;t think the students of Silicon Valley are more brilliant than University of Canterbury students, they are just more ambitious and adventurous. The quakes brought out Canterbury&#39;s innovative spirit. If we can cultivate it we&#39;ll have a world-class technology hub in our beautiful backyard.’’</p>
<p>Corbett-Davies was one of three members out of the Canterbury mechatronics class of 21 to receive Fulbright scholarships last year, an impressive achievement for the department. He was also granted a JR Templin Trust Scholarship.</p>
<p>His supervising UC lecturer, Professor Geoff Chase, says Corbett-Davies was one of the top mechatronics scholars he had seen in the past 10 years.</p>
