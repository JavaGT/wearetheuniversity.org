<p>National selects Todd Muller as Bay of Plenty candidate</p>
<p>The National Party has announced Todd Muller will be its candidate for the Bay of Plenty electorate at the 2014 General Election.</p>
<p>Mr Muller was selected by a meeting of local party members tonight.</p>
<p>“Todd brings a depth of experience and knowledge of the issues facing regional New Zealand that will ensure he is a strong and effective voice for Bay of Plenty,” said Regional Chair Peter Osborne.</p>
<p>“Tony Ryall has served this electorate loyally for 24 years and left big shoes to fill, but I know Todd will work hard to earn the trust of Bay of Plenty communities.”</p>
<p>Mr Muller thanked local members for their confidence in him and pledged to run a strong campaign to ensure the re-election of a John Key National-led Government on 20 September.</p>
<p>“The Bay of Plenty is where I grew up, and have lived and worked much of my adult life. It’s a great place to live with many opportunities ahead if we stick to path we’re on under this Government.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be taking nothing for granted this election. I’ll be working hard over the coming months engage with our communities about National’s plan and the important issues for Bay of Plenty,” said Mr Muller.</p>
<p>“With the support of our communities, I’ll work hard to keep Bay of Plenty’s strong voice in John Key’s National Party.”</p>
