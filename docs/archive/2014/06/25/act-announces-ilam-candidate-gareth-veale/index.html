<p><strong>ACT announces Ilam candidate Gareth Veale</strong></p>
<p>ACT New Zealand<br>June 25, 2014, 4:25pm</p>
<p>ACT Leader Jamie Whyte is pleased to announce ACT’s candidate for Ilam.</p>
<p>“Our Ilam candidate will be Gareth Veale. Gareth has strong ties to this region and I’m glad he has agreed to do his best to grow ACT’s party vote in the area,” says Mr Whyte.</p>
<p>Gareth lives in Riccarton with partner Gemma. He has previously stood for ACT in Ilam in 2011 and in the Christchurch East by-election in November last year. He currently works in insurance, helping settle Canterbury Earthquake claims.</p>
<p>“ACT is the only party in New Zealand that goes into elections without bribing the electorate. ACT, through its staunch principles, promises a truly good future that is achievable,” says Mr Veale.</p>
<p>“I&#39;m looking forward to introducing Ilam and wider Christchurch to ACT&#39;s plans to introduce lower and flatter taxes and a three strike policy for burglary.</p>
<p>“In the Christchurch East by-election, I highlighted the staggering rates of burglary and ACT’s commitment to champion tougher penalties for burglaries. I look forward to meeting voters and highlighting the hypocrisy of other candidates at the public meetings.”</p>
<p>“National needs a reliable coalition partner so that New Zealand can retain a stable government that values freedom, choice, and personal responsibility. The best way to achieve this is by giving your party vote to ACT!”</p>
