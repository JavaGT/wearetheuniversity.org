<p><strong>Strong culture of volunteering helps students succeed</strong></p>
<p>Etta Bollinger came to Victoria University of Wellington to be a successful student, and Vic Volunteers like Phill White have helped her be just that.</p>
<p>Vic Volunteers is a 200-strong group of students and staff, who have been active across the University for 20 years. It began with just 46 volunteers in 1994, with a goal of helping eliminate some of the barriers faced by students with disabilities.</p>
<p>Today, the roles include note-takers, van drivers, walkers, and team leaders who work alongside the staff of Disability Services, who enable Victoria to provide for students with temporary and ongoing disabilities.</p>
<p>Phill, an English Literature and Media Studies student, got involved after a friend told him more van drivers were needed to transport students with disabilities. He put his hand up straight away.</p>
<p>“It’s a great opportunity to interact with other students, rather than just getting on with your own study.”</p>
<p>Born with cerebral palsy, Etta, who is studying German and Sociology, has found that Disability Services put support in place around her study experience, rather than focusing on her disability.</p>
<p>“It takes a lot of effort organising transport and pushing myself all day, and the volunteers allow me to maximise the amount of energy that I have on my study–the reason why I’m at Victoria.”</p>
<p>Although some students volunteer because they like helping others, the long-term benefits are huge says Disability Services Manager Rachel Anderson-Smith.</p>

<p>“When students volunteer for us they often get better grades, focus more in class, gain skills for their CV and it even helps them attend 8am lectures!”</p>
<p>She says the biggest barrier people with disabilities face is the attitude of others.</p>
<p>“Volunteers are renowned for creating good change. We like to think of our volunteers as 200 champions for disability inclusion and awareness and 200 voices against discrimination,” says Rachel.</p>
<p>“We know that when students with disabilities are supported, there is an increase in achievement rates which is comparable to their non-disabled peers.”</p>
<p>The volunteer programme continues to be successful because of the prolonged effort to follow best practice and to run a professional programme, using a formal recruiting process for volunteers and offering continued professional development.</p>
<p>“We are proud of the volunteer culture at Victoria; it has helped Disability Services to be a leading provider of disability advice, expertise and support.”</p>
<p>More than 1000 students at Victoria identify as having some form of disability, a figure that is increasing each year.</p>
<p>“As accessibility of education at Victoria has improved, there has been a steady growth of students with disabilities choosing to study here. It’s fantastic to see the number of volunteers also increasing across all campuses each year.”</p>
<p><strong>16–22 June is New Zealand National Volunteer Week, celebrating the theme “Naku te rourou nau te rourou ka ora ai te tangata–With your contribution and my contribution the people will live.”</strong></p>
