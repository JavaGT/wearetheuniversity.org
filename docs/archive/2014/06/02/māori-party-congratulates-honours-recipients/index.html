<p><strong>Māori Party congratulates Queen&#39;s Birthday Honours Recipients for 2014</strong></p>
<p>Maori Party MPs have congratulated the individuals, whanau, hapu and iwi who have been recognised in the Queen&#39;s Birthday Honours for 2014 for their exemplary contribution to Maori development.</p>
<p>“There is a clear theme of Maori excellence demonstrated through the leadership and inspiration we see in every sphere of enterprise, including education, health, arts, culture, te reo, sports and the judiciary” said Hon Tariana Turia. “Topping the list is Dame Justice Lowell-Goddard, believed to be the first tangata whenua appointed to the High Court; one of the first New Zealand women to be appointed Queen&#39;s Counsel, a former Chair of the Independent Police Conduct Authority, and an expert member of the UN Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to commend three new Companions– Professor Jonathan Mane-Wheoki; Distinguished Professor Hingangaroa Smith; and Dr Huirangi Waikerepuru said Dr Pita Sharples. &quot;Professor Mane-Wheoki was appointed head of Elam School of Fine Arts at the University of Auckland; is an art historian, architectural historian, cultural historian and curator. Professor Smith and Dr Waikerepuru have played a significant role in language revitaliation; with Graham being co-founder or the national Centre for Maori Development and Advancement of Research Excellence, and as CEO of Te Whare Wananga o Awanuiarangi. Te Huirangi has been a driving force behind Te Reo O Taranaki; a leading figure in two major Waitangi Tribunal claims; which resulted in the formation of the Maori Broadcasting Agency, and later Maori Television&quot;.</p>

<p>“Iwi and hapu leadership is recognised in honouring Riki Herengitana-Cherrington (ONZM) in helping establishing Murihiku Marae in the South” said Te Ururoa Flavell. “Rangitane Marsden (ONZM) has been Chief Negotiator for Ngai Takoto’s Treaty settlement, and is an active member of Te Hiku Forum. Haami Piripi (ONZM) has held significant leadership roles for Te Taura Whiri (2000-2007); as Chair of Te Rarawa, in promoting access to broadband (Nga Pu Waea), in repatriation work (Te Papa) and education. Bevan Taylor (MNZM) has been the Chair of Maungaharuru-Tangitu since 1992 as well as being a master carver.</p>
<p>“The unique contribution of women in advancing treaty settlements is notable this year through the honouring of Vanessa Eparaima and Rahera Ohia” saidi Mrs Turia. “Vanessa (MNZM) is Chair of the Raukawa Settlement Trust, director of CNI Iwi Holdings and the inaugural chair of Kakano Investments while Rahera Ohia (QSM) is CEO of Te Au Maro o Ngati Pukenga; having returned home after a successful public service career.</p>
<p>“Health and hauora champions are honoured in recognizing the contributions of Miri Hawiki (MNZM), Chair of the Muturangi Hauora Marae Trust**;** Dr Tony Ruakere (MNZM) who was Chief Advisor of Maori Health for the Ministry of Health; a foundation member of Tui Ora and Te Ora, the Maori Doctors Association, and a member of the Kaumatua Kaunihera o Te Atiawa and Heather Te Au Skipworth (QSM) the co-founder of Iron Maori; a campaign to foster physical and mental health through a Maori approach to the challenge” said Te Ururoa Flavell.</p>
<p>“There are also a number of individuals honoured this year for an outstanding contribution at a national level to education said Dr Sharples. We acknowledge the honour of MNZM awarded to Iria Te Whiu of Tauranga Moana; Waihaere Mason of Ngati Kuia and David Scott in the Hawkes Bay; to the National President of the Maori Women’s Welfare League (Kataraina O’Brien, ONZM) and in recognizing Andrew Thompson (ONZM), the current Tumuaki o te Kingitanga” said Dr Sharples. &quot;It does the heart good to see these talented individuals - and all of the others who are honoured this year - being recognised for the positive difference they make to our nation&quot;.</p>
