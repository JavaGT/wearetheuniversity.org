<p>New International Aviation Law Course on offer at Auckland Law School</p>
<p>A new course in international aviation law will be offered at the Auckland Law School next month, opening-up a world of opportunities for students.</p>
<p>The course is not offered at any other New Zealand universities and few overseas universities offer the subject in any depth.</p>
<p>It has been made possible through the sponsorship of Air New Zealand and will be taught by a Master’s graduate of McGill University’s Institute of Air and Space Law in Montreal – the leading university in this area of law. It will be supported by Air New Zealand’s corporate legal team with content and guest lectures.</p>
<p>Dean Andrew Stockley says a career in aviation law offers a wide range of interesting and challenging roles in a subject that transcends national boundaries.</p>
<p>“Aviation law affects not just airlines but also airports, air-freight, manufacturing, finance, insurance, regulatory functions and many other industries,” he comments.</p>
<p>“The partnership between Air New Zealand and the Faculty of Law represents an opportunity for the university to develop a prominent position in this fascinating and challenging area of legal study in this region.”<br>Air New Zealand’s General Counsel John Blair says Asia is now the fastest growing global aviation market.</p>
<p>“Aviation has been a catalyst for change in international social behaviours and global commerce. As a key piece of international transport infrastructure and one of the world’s more complex and dynamic industries, aviation also attracts substantial government and private interest.<br>“This makes aviation law a great area of legal study, particularly for students aspiring to a highly rewarding international career.”</p>

<p>Dean Stockley says the new field of study adds to the University of Auckland’s attraction as a location for international students and contributes to its strong reputation in legal education.</p>
<p>“This course offers students an opportunity to develop life-long personal connections in the aviation industry.”</p>
<p>An added bonus is an Air New Zealand subject prize package for the best two students in the course, who will each receive two return economy airfares to any of the airline’s destinations in New Zealand, Australia or the Pacific Islands.</p>
