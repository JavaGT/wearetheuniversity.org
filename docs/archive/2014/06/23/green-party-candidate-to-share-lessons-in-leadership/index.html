<p>Green Party candidate and ex-pupil to share lessons in leadership with Westlake Girls High School</p>
<p>Anne-Elise Smithson, an ex-pupil of Westlake, is looking forward to sharing her inspiring leadership journey with students at Westlake Girls’ High School on Monday 30 June, as a member of the 2014 Sir Peter Blake Trust Dream Team.</p>
<p>The topic of her speech is ‘empowering young women in leadership’.</p>
<p>Led by New Zealand’s Governor-General, Lt. Gen. The Rt. Hon. Sir Jerry Mateparae, the close to 300-strong Dream Team of leaders will be speaking to classrooms throughout New Zealand, in a bid to inspire young people in New Zealand to ‘make it happen’ – the theme of this year’s Sir Peter Blake Trust Leadership Week.</p>
<p>Anne-Elise will be sharing her thoughts with between 100 and 200 students on her journey to becoming a candidate in the general election, what she has learned during her career and the importance of having goals and dreams that you want to achieve, as well as the motivation and drive to make those dreams happen.</p>
<p>Anne-Elise Smithson is joined in the 2014 Dream Team by other high-profile leaders, including business leaders, Sir Ron Carter and Sir Eion Edgar, politician and TV personality Tamati Coffey, television psychologist Nigel Latta, scientist and inventor Sir Ray Avery, TVNZ presenters Rawdon Christie and Toni Street, ZB radio host Rachel Smalley, Air New Zealand Chief Pilot Capt. David Morgan, sporting greats Hamish Carter and Beatrice Paumuina and a wide-ranging list of New Zealand adventurers, CEOs and business leaders, doctors, politicians and community champions.</p>

<p>Sir Peter Blake Trust Leadership Week begins with the Trust’s annual Leadership Awards, on Friday 27 June, where the prestigious Blake Medal will be presented, along with six Sir Peter Blake Leadership Awards. Leadership Week concludes with Red Socks Day on Friday 4 July.</p>
