<p><strong>Wednesday, 18 June 2014, 11:04 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Provinces being hit hard by government policies</p>
<p>The overheated Auckland housing market and the Reserve Bank’s response to lift interest rates are causing massive damage to our provinces, Labour’s Finance spokesperson David Parker says.</p>
<p>“Leading economist Shamubeel Eaqub has called the latest rise in the official cash rate a ‘huge mistake’ that is punishing small town New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Auckland house prices have risen 20 per cent in real terms since 2007, with Canterbury prices up 13 per cent and Wellington up 7 per cent. Yet house prices in the rest of the country have fallen 21 per cent in real terms over the same period.</p>
<p>“Shamubeel Eaqub says it ‘scares the hell out of him’ that each OCR rise risks tipping the regions into recession.</p>
<p>“He also points out that ‘the gaps opening up in New Zealand are really big across geographical, race and education lines’.</p>
<p>“This is exactly what Labour has been saying.</p>
<p>“National’s policies have failed to rebalance the economy towards the productive economy and jobs.</p>
<p>“This failure is evident in figures out today that show despite being buoyed by our terms of trade being at a 40 year high, New Zealand still has a significant current account deficit of $6.3 billion (2.8 percent of GDP). And it is only forecast to get worse from here on.</p>
<p>“A Labour government will rebalance the economy towards the productive sector and breathe life back into our provinces.</p>
<p>“Labour will take the heat out of the Auckland housing market by taxing capital gains, clamping down on overseas speculators and building 100,000 affordable houses. We will also exempt first-time home buyers and the provinces from mortgage restrictions.</p>
<p>“Labour’s Economic Upgrade will create sustainable and well-paid jobs. We will foster conditions for industries to grow in through research and development tax credits.</p>
<p>“A Labour government will stop the growing inequality between Auckland and our provinces,” David Parker says.</p>
