<p><strong>Winter Lecture Series to look to the future</strong></p>
<p>How will we do business in the future? What will Hamilton look like in 20 years’ time? These, and other big questions, will be up for discussion at the University of Waikato’s Winter Lecture Series.</p>
<p>The future of business, online security, entertainment and our very own city will feature in a series of lectures each Wednesday in August. All lectures will have a forward-looking theme as the University celebrates its 50th anniversary and looks to the next 50 years and beyond. All lectures are free and open to the public.</p>
<p><strong>The city of the future</strong><br>Highlights of this year’s series includes a conversation with Neil Everson, the force behind the revitalisation of Hamilton, Ontario, from a so-called ‘steel-worker’ town to a dynamic and colourful city in which the businesses are clamouring to invest.</p>
<p>Protecting yourself and your family from online crime will be the topic of discussion for NetSafe Executive Director Martin Cocker, and University of Waikato alumnus and television presenter Jesse Mulligan will lead a panel discussion on the future of entertainment with Cambridge-based author Julie Thomas and The Wireless’ reporter and senior producer Megan Whelan.</p>
<p><strong>Welcoming the community</strong><br>University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford looks forward to the annual lecture series as an opportunity to welcome the community on to campus.</p>
<p>“One of our responsibilities, and privileges, as a university is to share knowledge and expertise with the community. Each year we have a range of interesting speakers and topics up for discussion, and this year will certainly be no different.”</p>

<p><strong>Future focus</strong><br>The series begins on Wednesday 6 August with ‘Its Business Time – What Will Business Look Like in the Future?’ Coming together to discuss the future of business, the role of iwi, and sustainable business practices will be 37 Degrees South independent director and alumnus Chris Insley, Raglan-based online retailer and director Steve Crowhurst, and business sustainability academics Professor Juliet Roper and Associate Professor Eva Collins, from Waikato Management School.</p>
<p>On 13 August cyber security comes into focus in ‘Don’t Get Bit-ten – How Safe Are You Online? Joining Martin Cocker on stage will be the University’s head of the new cyber-security lab Dr Ryan Ko and online law expert and senior lecturer Dr Wayne Rumbles.</p>
<p>Wednesday 20 August will see Jesse Mulligan chatting to Julie Thomas and Megan Whelan on all things entertainment – reading, writing, and news culture; while Associate Professor Geoff Lealand focuses on the future of viewing, film and film-going in ‘That’s Entertainment – What Does The Future of Viewing Look Like?’</p>
<p>Finally, our city is under the microscope on 27 August in ‘The City of the Future – What Can Hamilton Learn From The Others?’ Neil Everson, Acting General Manager of Planning and Development for the City of Hamilton, Ontario, joins us online from Canada with Hamilton property developer and Waikato alumnus Andrew Yeoman, of Yeoman Developments, and demographer Professor Natalie Jackson to examine what Hamilton will look like in the future, and what Hamilton can learn from other cities who have gone through a revitalisation process.</p>
<p>The Winter Lecture Series is held in the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts and lectures are free to attend. The lectures run from 6 – 7pm and the Opus Bar is open from 5pm.</p>
