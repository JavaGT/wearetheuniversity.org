<p>KING</p>
<p>Health Spokesperson<br>30 June 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Canterbury health services to get boost</strong></p>
<p>Labour is to invest in Canterbury’s health system to help people dealing with the ongoing health impacts of the earthquakes and their aftermath.</p>
<p>“Nearly four years on and people in Canterbury are still struggling with the after effects of the quakes,” Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“We are hearing reports of increasing numbers of young people being on suicide watch and mental health providers struggling to cope with the extra demand.</p>
<p>“That is why Labour is promising to invest $1million in local non-government mental health services and double the number of nurses working in the Canterbury District Health Board schools-based mental health team.</p>
<p>“Labour is also committing to investing $12.5 million for new health hubs in Rangiora and Akaroa, something the DHB has been left to pay for out of baseline funding despite extra and on-going costs following the earthquakes.</p>
<p>“We will also ensure that after hours GP services are available.</p>
<p>“The people of Canterbury want to get on with their lives. Having access to the health services they need is an essential part of that,” Annette King said.</p>
