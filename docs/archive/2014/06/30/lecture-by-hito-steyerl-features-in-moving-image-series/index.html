<p>“What do an empty bullet casing and the contemporary art museum have in common?” asks Berlin-based artist Hito Steyerl in her provocative video lecture <em>Is a Museum a Battlefield?</em>, which opens on Friday 4 Julyat the Adam Art Gallery.</p>
<p>Hito Steyerl is one of contemporary art’s most stimulating figures, known for writings and videos that pose challenging questions about the state of our world in the digital age, under the conditions of global capitalism.</p>
<p><em>Is a Museum a Battlefield?</em> was presented at the 13th Istanbul Biennial in 2013, soon after rioters protesting the erosion of public space staged major demonstrations in the city, events that deeply affected this headline art event.</p>
<p>“Steyerl’s approach to this highly politicised context makes intriguing viewing for audiences interested in questioning the social and political responsibilities of artists,” says Adam Art Gallery Director, Christina Barton.</p>
<p>The video installation will be launched at 5.30pm on Friday 4 July with a special screening followed by a discussion led by Christina Barton, together with art critic and commentator, Martin Patrick and Letting Space Director, Sophie Jerram.</p>
