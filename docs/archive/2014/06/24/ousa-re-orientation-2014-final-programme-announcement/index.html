<p>With two more music events including one in association with Radio One 91FM, the full timetable of events for the Otago University Students’ Association Re-Orientation has been announced today.</p>

<p>Friday 11th July sees popular Wellington band who are currently battling for the #1 spot on <em>TheAudience.co.nz</em> chart, Drax Project, dominate Starters Bar from 9pm along with local lads Summer Thieves, Auckland’s Dick Johnson, and Weird Together.</p>
<p>Radio One 91FM takes over Sammy’s on Saturday the 12th with a Radio One Club Night featuring well-known headliners and Ladyhawke support act She’s So Rad supported by local chart toppers Ha the Unclear, and Wellington rising star and Lorde favourite Race Banyon.</p>
<p>Along with the integral OUSA events that include Market Day, Clubs Day, the Dunedin International Food Festival is back for its winter session featuring all the best food from around the world brought to Dunedin by OUSA’s international clubs.</p>
<p>“With over 15 different stalls catering food from around the globe, the Dunedin International Food festival is one of the most popular events OUSA runs,” said Sycamore-Smith. “It’s a chance for Dunedin to get a taste of the cultures that reside in the city and also provides a really important income source for our international clubs.”</p>
