<p><strong>Police Stretched, Rural NZ Virtually Unpoliced Overnight</strong></p>
<p>Police Minister Anne Tolley must explain why rural police are left to face potentially dangerous situations alone, and at night, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“Police numbers are stretched so thin rural New Zealand is virtually unpoliced overnight – all there is is a sole off-duty officer who is required to respond to incidents that may be an hour’s drive away,” says Police spokesperson Richard Prosser.</p>
<p>“To have one off-duty officer on call to cover half the Waikato is beyond ridiculous, it’s insanity, and it’s going to get someone killed as a whistle-blower has pointed out,” Mr Prosser said.</p>
<p>“The government has made extraordinary claims about a reduction in crime to justify its massive $40 million cut to the police budget, which it has frozen for nearly six years.</p>
<p>“Fudging statistics and refusing to admit that people are not reporting crime because they know the police don’t have the resources to respond, is not the path of responsible Government.</p>
<p>“It’s a cynical manipulation of the facts in an attempt to make the books look good in election year,” he said.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First’s achievements include the recruitment of 1000 additional frontline police and we want to improve on this again.</p>
<p>“We want an end to sole-charge police stations, and to the single staffing of patrol cars at night. That means recruiting more officers, not closing stations and parking up cars.</p>
<p>“New Zealand should have at least the same number of police per capita as Australia,” says Mr Prosser.</p>
