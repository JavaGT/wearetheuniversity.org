<p>Funding hopes from award victory</p>
<p>A national titanium technology grouping, based at the University of Waikato, has won a major award at the second annual KiwiNet Research Commercialisation Awards.</p>
<p>Titanium Technologies New Zealand (TiTeNZ) - a collaboration between the University of Waikato, Tauranga&#39;s Titanium Industry Development Association (TiDA), Callaghan Innovation, GNS Science, the University of Auckland, and a number of industry partners – won the AJ Park Commercialisation Collaboration Award at a ceremony in Auckland in June.</p>
<p>TiTeNZ is a world leader in the development of titanium powder metallurgy and the Awards are the pinnacle of KiwiNet activities, designed to build awareness and inspire research commercialisation success.</p>
<p>Professor Brian Gabbitas from the Faculty of Science and Engineering hopes the award will lead to further funding for research into titanium and the development of more commercially-viable products. At the University of Waikato, titanium research is largely centred on the production of products from titanium or titanium powder through either extrusion or forging.</p>
<p>“We are working closely with South Auckland Forging Engineering and are manufacturing diving knives and components for deep sea diving apparatus,” he says.</p>
<p>The benefits of titanium are its strength and light weight and Professor Gabbitas says forging or extruding products cuts waste significantly compared to milling products from a solid piece of The use of titanium powder also cuts production costs significantly, he says.</p>
<p>Each partner involved in TiTeNZ is involved in different aspects of research, with further support from AUT also proving beneficial Professor Gabbitas says.</p>
