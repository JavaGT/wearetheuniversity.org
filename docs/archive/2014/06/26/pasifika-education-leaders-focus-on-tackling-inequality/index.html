<p><strong>Pasifika education leaders focus on tackling inequality</strong></p>
<p>26 June 2014</p>
<p>Tackling inequality will be a key focus of a two day fono in Auckland later this week where Pasifika education leaders will be looking at how recent Government education policies are likely to impact on Pasifika children.</p>
<p>At least 250 education leaders are taking part in the two day Leo Pasifika fono organised by NZEI Te Riu Roa.</p>
<p>National President Judith Nowotarski says inequality in education is a major concern in the Pasifika community and the leaders at the conference will be taking the opportunity to strengthen and raise their collective voice in this current education environment.</p>
<p>“It is vital that Pasifika children get fair and equitable access to culturally appropriate quality public education.</p>
<p>“We’ll be looking particularly at the challenges that face Pasifika children and their families and the government’s controversial $359-m Investing in Educational Success will be put under the spotlight.</p>
<p>“We have seen some real successes in Pasifika education and in innovative and relevant leadership, particularly in the early childhood sector.&quot;</p>
<p>But Ms Nowotarski says there is a real risk that the government’s drive towards competition, standardisation and data-driven accountability will have a negative impact on education for Pasifika kids.</p>
<p>Participants will take part in workshops focussing on connections and cultural intelligence, engaging with parent communities and growing Pasifika leaders.</p>
<p>Keynote speakers include Strategic Planning Adviser for the Tokelau Government, Lili Tuioti and Prof Toeolesulusulu Damon Salesa from Auckland University.</p>
<p>Ms Tuioti has had extensive experience in the education sectors in New Zealand and more recently in the Pacific Islands. Dr Salesa is a former Rhodes Scholar and currently professor at Auckland University’s Centre for Pacific Studies. He has written a number of books on the history of the Pacific and British and US empires.</p>
<p>The fono is being held at the Crowne Plaza in Auckland, 27-28 June.</p>
