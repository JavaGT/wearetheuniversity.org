<p><strong>Monday, 16 June 2014, 10:05 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour will protect homes from rockfall</p>
<p>A Labour government will protect Port Hills homes at risk of rockfall to avoid them being unnecessarily knocked down, Labour’s Canterbury Recovery spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.</p>
<p>“Labour will partner will the Christchurch City Council so families can stay in their homes. We will pay a 50 per cent contribution towards rockfall protection work to save houses wherever it is economical.</p>
<p>“A Labour government will allow Crown-owned land to be used for protection work which will help reduce costs. We will also ensure the value of protecting CERA-owned property is counted when the benefits of proposed protection work are assessed.</p>
<p>“We won’t be able to save every house. There will be homes where the cost of protection work is too high to justify the expense. But Labour’s plan will mean many families get to keep their homes.</p>
<p>“Our policy is cost-neutral and may even result in net savings for the Government and Council. What is spent on rockfall protection will be saved by not having to pay to buy-out at-risk homes.</p>
<p>“Labour puts people first. Our policy will give families certainty so they can get on with their lives,” Ruth Dyson says.</p>
