<p><strong>Victoria leads charge for child-safe batteries</strong></p>
<p>Innovative battery technology designed at Victoria University of Wellington could soon be helping to save the lives of young children all over the world.</p>
<p>Design lecturer Jeongbin Ok has hit upon a solution to minimise the damage of swallowing coin-sized, button cell lithium batteries, commonly found in electronic devices such as toys and remote controls, which can result in serious harm or death if not treated within two hours.</p>
<p>In collaboration with one of the world’s largest battery manufacturers, Mr Ok, who has qualifications in design and chemical engineering, has spent the last three years developing modifications to button batteries.</p>
<p>His invention involves applying a thin layer of highly concentrated food colouring to the surface of button batteries during production. The food colouring is activated by saliva.</p>
<p>“If a child swallows a battery it will immediately stain their mouth, so that caregivers know what has happened and can seek medical treatment immediately,” says Mr Ok.</p>
<p>To assess the viability of his invention, Viclink, Victoria’s commercialisation office, helped Mr Ok to identify a suitable partner, putting in place a joint development and licensing agreement. Mass production is expected to begin early next year.</p>
<p>“For Victoria University to be involved in a project that will have global implications for the safety of children is a great opportunity. I hope that once the product is commercialised it will become an industry standard,” he says.</p>

<p>Mr Ok is also working on new packaging technology to keep loose batteries secure and provide a safe way of disposing of used batteries.</p>
<p>His research has led to Victoria University being the only academic institution to partner in a national and global initiative, called The Battery Controlled, which is focused on preventing children from swallowing button batteries.</p>
<p>Mr Ok’s research has been conducted with support from the Consumer Product Safety Commission in the United States and Consumer Affairs New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>Some facts about button batteries</strong></p>
<p>• From 2011 until 2013, the National Poisons Centre received 175 calls regarding button battery-related child injuries.<br>• Sixty-three children were treated at Starship Children’s Health emergency department from March 2009 until February 2012.<br>• Children under six years old are at the greatest risk of swallowing button batteries.<br>• When a button battery gets stuck in a child’s throat, their saliva triggers an electrical current that can severely burn the oesophagus in as little as two hours.<br>• Symptoms may be similar to other childhood illnesses, such as coughing, drooling and discomfort.<br>• When X-rayed, the battery can be mistaken for a coin.<br>• Once burning begins, damage can continue even after the battery is removed.</p>
