<p><strong>Local Democracy Coalition Political Panel<br>Wednesday 4 June, 2.45pm<br>Tawa Room, Brentwood Hotel, 16 Kemp Street, Kilbirnie, Wellington</strong></p>
<p><em>Put the ‘Local’ Back Into ‘Local Government’</em></p>
<p>For the next few minutes please consider the two words ‘local’ and ‘government’.</p>
<p>Taken separately, we all know what these words mean but together, as part of a political expression and put in the local government context, somehow a sense of meaning has been lost.</p>
<p>Why? Because local government has been disconnected through a combination of resentful antipathy and an agenda of aggrandisement.</p>
<p>Many New Zealanders will remember the borough councils, the county councils and the city councils that served local communities for many years.</p>
<p>That was a time when the local councils had some connection with their communities.</p>
<p>Councillors were usually mature individuals who had run local businesses or organisations and were altruistic about giving something back.</p>
<p>They were not in it for the money.</p>
<p>They were in touch with the people who did not hesitate to ring them – usually to complain!</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, because of their geographic proximity, local communities felt that they knew them.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few decades and numerous amalgamations and so called reforms and local government is now an industry that spews out forests of reports, analyses, plans and excuses.</p>
<p>The current obsession with amalgamation is causing even more disconnection.</p>
<p>The so called Super City of Auckland has become a state within a state and more dysfunctional than the clutter of local bodies that were forced into this shotgun wedding.</p>
<p>Remember there was no grassroots support for a Super City.</p>
<p>It was imposed on the people by the dysfunctional leader of a dysfunctional political party.</p>
<p>But as important, the Prime Minister had, prior to the legislation bringing the Super City into effect, already made public his support for the concept.</p>
<p>Of equal importance, the people who came to comprise the Super City were never asked.</p>
<p>They did not get a vote.</p>
<p>They had this system imposed on them from above.</p>
<p>It was the very antithesis of local government democracy.</p>
<p>If you recall, the proponents of the Auckland Super City promised that the amalgamation, even though it was to be imposed without a vote, would bring rates down.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of thousands of Aucklanders that fell for that puffery and are now paying increased rates and regretting their naiveté.</p>
<p>And every day now, they are being subjected to central government propaganda that says that the only reason we have a housing crisis in Auckland is because_local government_ is failing to provide the supply of housing to match the demand.</p>
<p>That is an egregious, self-serving, central government fiction.</p>
<p>It enables central government to keep increasing demand whilst blaming local government for failing to meet supply.</p>
<p>Here is the point. Local government must take the people with it.</p>
<p>Why? Because it is theirs! They paid for it and are still paying for it.</p>
<p>They have the right to decide and the thought of a group of people machinating behind closed doors the future democratic state of Wellington local bodies is abhorrent!</p>
<p>But this modern National Government has never shown much understanding, appreciation or respect for the conventions, practices and institutions that underpin our democracy.</p>
<p>Local government is a fundamental element of our democracy and needs to be recognised as such.</p>
<p>Take the residents of Upper Hutt – why should they be sucked into a Wellington Super City if they see no value in it?</p>
<p>Will they get the chance to be properly informed on all aspects to this?</p>
<p>Will they get to learn both sides of the debate?</p>
<p>Will they then get the chance to make an informed vote on this?</p>
<p>We do not witness a clamour for amalgamation among ordinary citizens and ratepayers of the greater Wellington area.</p>
<p>In reality, is amalgamation actually about fulfilling the dreams of certain ambitious politicians rather than meeting genuine needs of residents?</p>
<p>Because, for example, how many people in Lower Hutt are actually demanding a super city? Are there any?</p>
<p>And what about Wairarapa?</p>
<p>There is a natural boundary called the Rimutakas.</p>
<p>There is no close community of interest between Wairarapa and Wellington.</p>
<p>They’ve even got their own rugby team - and they want to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a case for a greater Wairarapa Council – but that should be for the people of Wairarapa to decide.</p>
<p>This, after all is a freedom issue and the people should be free to choose.</p>
<p>The leaders of local government have a chance to show some leadership.</p>
<p>New Zealand First says it’s time to put the ‘local’ back into local government.</p>
<p>The attitude of ‘them and us’ has to change.</p>
<p>Keith Holyoake used to say when in doubt trust the people.</p>
<p>We urge you to ‘trust the people’.</p>
<p>And we urge you to accept their choice, whatever their choice may be.</p>
