<p>AUSA put up team for quiz show</p>
<p>Auckland University Student’s Association (AUSA) is excited to be taking part in the return of University Challenge.</p>
<p>The popular TVNZ show, based on the British show of the same name, pits teams from Universities around the country against each other in a challenging quiz show format.</p>
<p>As in the British show, teams will be asked individual starter questions. The team answering a starter correctly gets a set of &quot;bonus&quot; questions worth a potential fifteen points. Throughout the entire show the speed of the questions increases, putting participants under more pressure.</p>
<p>Teams consist of four members and a reserve, with each team representing a single New Zealand university. AUSA&#39;s team consists of Tim Hickey, Adam Clearwater, Isabella Coventry, Alistair Kendrick and Caitlin Smart.</p>
<p>‘We’re really excited to be putting forward a team of such fantastic students’ says Cate Bell, President of AUSA. ‘I’m sure that they’re going to do AUSA and the University proud’.</p>
<p>Students interested in being part of the team took part in a trial held under exam conditions.</p>
<p>AUSA was astounded by the number of students interested, with hundreds of students sitting the exam for a chance to represent the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>The team is now hard at work preparing for their chance on the national stage, although they’re keeping their preparation techniques secret to avoid tipping off the competition. ‘Throughout this process, AUSA has been really helpful for us,’ says Caitlin Smart. ‘They’ve helped us find spaces to practice in, organised resources, and have generally given us assistance in anything we need’.</p>

<p>“This competition is invaluable as a student-orientated event that showcases our best and brightest students,” says Cate Bell. “It is great to see students’ associations nationwide involved in its organisation. Such a strong level of student involvement leads to high participation rates and engagement with the student body. We are proud that students’ associations, with their direct link to students and effective student voice, have had the chance facilitate the show.”</p>
<p>The contest is taking place at Universities around the country over the Inter Semester break, between 30th June and 6th of July.</p>
