<p><strong>Demonstration dairy farm for Waikato: St Peter’s and Lincoln sign joint venture</strong></p>
<p>St Peter’s School, Cambridge and Lincoln University today announced a new joint venture that will replicate in the Waikato the hugely successful demonstration dairy farm that the University and its partners operate in Canterbury. The demonstration farm will be formed using St Peter’s existing dairy farm, which has as its boundaries State Highway One and the Waikato River, alongside the famous School itself.</p>
<p>St Peter’s Principal Steve Robb said “This joint venture gives our region another world class opportunity to study, learn and produce in this most significant industry for our country. St Peter’s is delighted to be involved with another top quality organisation which strives for excellence.</p>
<p>“Our school’s Founder had the foresight to surround the school with a dairy farm, and this is highly relevant to Agribusiness, which is the powerhouse of the region and of the New Zealand economy.<br>This Joint Venture will benefit all involved – our students, dairy farmers, future farmers, and businesses, as they develop their economic and environmental future.</p>
<p>“Our focus will be on the business of farming, with Agribusiness related courses through to tertiary level, building on our current excellent programmes in Agriculture/Horticulture years 10 to 13, and linked through our new Business and Entrepreneurial Centre, which is already underway this year.”</p>

<p>Lincoln University Vice-Chancellor, Dr Andrew West said “This represents a major boost to the Waikato because it will represent the realities of dairy farming in the region. This demonstration farm will provide leadership in how to farm dairy cows profitably, yet within the environmental limits set by the Waikato Regional Council. It will focus on farm performance and the associated integrity of dairy products arising therefrom. It will also inspire more young people to consider the land-based industry for a worthwhile career, a talent pool that this country urgently needs.</p>
<p>“The demonstration farm will target being in the top 3% of profitability and top 3% of environmental performance, yet while doing so will test whole new farming systems from which people can learn. Farmers are going to love this” said Dr West.</p>
<p>St Peter’s School, Cambridge and Lincoln University will now establish a governance committee that governs the farm and a management committee that focuses on optimising the farm’s dairying system.</p>
<p>Together the joint venture will seek commercial sponsors to fund demonstration activities and objective, scientific monitoring of the farm’s performance.</p>
