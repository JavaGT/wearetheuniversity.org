<p><strong>“Promise and Promiscuity” - Breeches, Bonnets and Balls</strong></p>
<p><strong>Penny Ashton on tour with Arts on Tour New Zealand</strong></p>
<p><strong>Playhouse Theatre, Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts, University of Waikato, Hamilton</strong></p>
<p><strong>Friday 4th July at 7.30pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Penny Ashton returns to Hamilton with her new show, &quot;Promise &amp; Promiscuity&quot;, on Friday 4th July</strong></p>
<p>A new award-winning musical show based very loosely on Jane Austen’s timeless classic novel “Pride &amp; Prejudice”</p>
<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a woman in possession of a theatre script…must be in want of an audience. Charmingly accomplished Penny Ashton (Hot Pink Bits, Good Morning, Heartland Kiwi Gold) mashes up the Beethoven, bonnets and big balls …with alacrity.</p>
<p>Follow the fortunes of Miss Elspeth Slowtree as she battles literary snobbery, her mother’s nerves and Cousin Horatio, all armed with superior wit, blushing countenance and generally being quite bright, you know…for a girl. Balls will be attended, crosses will be stitched and manners will be minded, all with not one ankle in sight.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton has stolen Miss Austen’s best lines to bring this musical to life with an authentic twist. As Elizabeth Bennett herself says: <em>“Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can.”</em></p>
<p>Featuring classical music reworked by Robbie Ellis and lyrics by Ashton, Promise and Promiscuity delivers Penny Ashton unchaperoned to the provinces......quite frankly, it’s promiscuous.</p>
<p><em>“…in the hands of Misses Ashton and Austen, this is an ‘attractive ball’ of a show.”</em> - NZ Herald</p>
<p>“<em>Promise and Promiscuity, as a self-penned poke at Pride and Prejudice, is the perfect vehicle for an actress at the height of her power, for Penny Ashton is a virtuosa of rare skill…..a treat not to be missed.”</em> – Robert Gilbert, Theatreview</p>
<p>“…<em>a textbook example of how to do a great one woman show</em>.” <em>CBC</em></p>
<p>“… <em>will please both Janeites and Jane-whos</em>?” <em>Winnipeg Free Press</em></p>
