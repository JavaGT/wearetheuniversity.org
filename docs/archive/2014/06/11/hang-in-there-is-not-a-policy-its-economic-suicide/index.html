<p>“Hang in There” is Not a Policy It’s Economic Suicide. Mamedov.!</p>
<p>Hang in there is not a policy. It’s National Party economic suicide. Last night’s panel meeting with Jami-Lee Ross gave Botany residents little hope for the immediate future except to expect more heavy trucks on the roads.!</p>
<p>Public transport has been totally ignored by the National government and never been effectively lobbied for by the present Botany MP says Tok Mamedov, Labour Party candidate for Botany.!</p>
<p>“Despite my opponent’s protestations at his meeting poor planning and lack of investment in South East Auckland is an inditement on the National government and its local body allies who have always been in favour of promoting Heavy trucking, congestion, social isolation and transport induced poverty.!</p>
<p>Mamedov says that Botany residents waste hundreds of hours a year sitting in trafc struggling to get to work and stripping thousands of dollars from their household budgets in petrol and car maintenance a year because of National’s reluctance to foster efcient and effective co-ordinated public transport systems.!</p>
<p>“Despite all of my opponent’s protestations and promises National has no policies, no plans and no inclination to lift Auckland’s public transport system into the 21st century. Last night’s meeting gave Botany no hope for a brighter future.!</p>
