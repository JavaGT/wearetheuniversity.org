<p>Associate Transport Spokesperson</p>
<p>11 June 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Under pressure minister forced to admit further delays</strong></p>
<p>Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has been forced to admit the timeline for implementing the Christchurch city transport plan has been pushed back once again, Labour’s Christchurch transport spokesperson Megan Woods says.</p>
<p>“After weeks of refusing to respond to questions, Gerry Brownlee today confessed there will be further delays in the implementation of ‘An Accessible City’ – the transport plan for Christchurch.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/transport/9341792/Transport-plan-for-an-accessible-city">In October last year</a>, the Minister signalled the implementation of the long overdue plan would be completed in December 2013 and construction work would be visible in early 2014.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/business/qwa/QWA_00716_2014/716-2014-dr-megan-woods-to-the-minister-for-canterbury">In February this year</a>, he argued the December date was a typographical error and it would be completed in May.</p>
<p>“But in responses to written questions released today, he has been forced to admit the plan will only be finalised later this month – six months later than initially heralded.</p>
<p>“While I understand there are processes that need to be worked through, it’s simply not good enough for the Minister to continue to publish timelines only to revise them once he realises the work isn’t progressing fast enough.</p>

<p>“This plan forms a vital part of getting Christchurch moving. Gerry Brownlee needs to stop coming up with excuses and take responsibility for the deadlines he is missing.</p>
<p>“Cantabrians are understandably frustrated with the level of personal disruption to their lives over the past three years.</p>
<p>“Everyone accepts the rebuild is a large undertaking but Cantabrians shouldn’t have to accept continuous delays at the highest level of Government that slow progress, and the smoke and mirrors used to justify them,” Megan Woods says.</p>
