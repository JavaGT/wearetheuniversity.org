<p>Iain<br>LEES-GALLOWAY</p>
<p>Associate Health (Aged Care) Spokesperson<br>11 June 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Tragedy should lead to action in aged care</strong></p>
<p>Labour is renewing calls for reform of the aged care sector following the tragic deaths of five Christchurch rest home residents.</p>
<p>The elderly women died following an outbreak of strep A at Bishop Selwyn Lifecare. Another is in hospital in a critical condition.</p>
<p>“While the Canterbury Health Board is working with the rest home owners to ensure other residents are safe, the incident will have left the families of those five women absolutely distraught,” Labour’s Aged Care spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway said.</p>
<p>“We owe it to them to do more than talk, and that means the Government making improvements across the aged care sector sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>“There have been numerous reports and reviews of the sector, all resulting in calls for better pay, minimum training levels and an industry-wide quality assurance system.</p>
<p>“Sadly this year’s Budget offered nothing for aged care.</p>
<p>“If we judge society by the value it places on our most vulnerable, then we also have to value their carers.</p>
<p>“Labour has been working closely with providers, unions, and industry training organisations to develop an aged care strategy, something we should have had before now.”</p>
