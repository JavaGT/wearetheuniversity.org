<p><strong>Wednesday, 11 June 2014, 4:57 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students'_Association">Otago University Students&#39; Association</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>OUSA Re-Orientation Week 2014</strong><br><strong>9-12 July &amp; 22 July</strong></p>
<p>The annual Re-Orientation timetable of events associated with the Otago University Students’ Association has been announced today, with tickets also on sale from today via the OUSA Main office.</p>
<p>“We’re working on creating another great line up for the Re-Orientation period that includes not just music events but food, clubs and even features one thousand special student priced tickets for the English Premier League game,” said Ruby Sycamore-Smith, OUSA President. “We’re excited to provide Otago students with another week of diverse and exciting entertainment with a flavour to suit all tastes.”</p>
<p>Student favourite <strong>Illuminate Paint Party</strong> is back with a new layout including being alcohol free and the team will be installing a new safety matting to the Forsyth Barr Stadium’s eastern slab.</p>
<p>“The event is hugely popular and we believe that it will once again be a massive event with students always ready for a great night out in the paint!” said Sycamore-Smith. “Due to the demand from students we’re happy to align with the franchise again in a safety and ticketing agent role.”</p>
<p>Along with the staple OUSA events that include <strong>Market Day</strong>, <strong>Clubs Day</strong>, the <strong>Dunedin International Food Festival</strong> is back for its winter session featuring all the best food from around the world brought to Dunedin by OUSA’s international clubs.</p>
<p>“With over 15 different stalls catering food from across the globe, the Dunedin International Food festival is one of the most popular events OUSA runs,” said Sycamore-Smith. “It’s a chance for Dunedin to get a taste of the cultures that reside in the city and also provides a really important income for our international clubs.”</p>
