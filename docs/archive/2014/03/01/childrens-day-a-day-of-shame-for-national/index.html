<p>Children’s Day a day of shame for National</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Key and his National Government should hang their heads in shame during Children’s Day tomorrow for their unwillingness to tackle child poverty, says Labour Leader David Cunliffe</p>
<p>“Children’s Day this year comes just days after the Government was forced to admit a stuff-up by Treasury resulted in the incomes of 300,000 low-income Kiwi households being understated by thousands of dollars each on average.</p>
<p>“It revealed National has been underestimating the number of Kiwi kids living in poverty by 20,000.</p>
<p>“National has done nothing to address child poverty. Its only answer has been a proposal to introduce performance pay for teachers. The Government fails to realise that children don’t leave their lives at the classroom door.</p>
<p>“Under Labour’s Best Start package, the parents of about 50,000 kids living in poverty will be $60 a week better off until their child turns three.</p>
<p>“This could make the world of difference to struggling families.</p>
<p>“Under Best Start, a Labour government will also increase free early childhood education for three to five-year-olds from 20 to 25 hours a week, build more childcare centres in needy areas, extend paid parental leave from 14 to 26 weeks and support vulnerable mums-to-be.</p>
<p>“Labour recognises that times are tough for Kiwi families who are yet to share the rewards of National’s much heralded economic recovery.</p>
<p>“Labour is committed to tackling child poverty and ensuring that all Kiwi kids get the very best start in life,” David Cunliffe says.</p>
