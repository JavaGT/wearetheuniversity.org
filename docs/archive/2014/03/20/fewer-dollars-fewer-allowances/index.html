<p><strong>Thursday, 20 March 2014, 2:48 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students'_Association">Otago University Students&#39; Association</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Fewer dollars, fewer Allowances</strong></p>
<p>After a tough year for student job hunters in 2013 which saw a $700,000 decrease in student earnings, the New Year has started off slow with a further small decline in income over the first two months of 2014 compared to 2013.</p>
<p>“We’re concerned that the impact of further reductions in student allowance availability will mean more students will need to work to make up the difference.” Said Ruby Sycamore-Smith, OUSA President 2014. “We see tertiary education and training as a right for all, there needs to be support for those who just simply don’t have the time to work on top of study.”</p>
<p>After three years of increases and a peak of $8.1 Million in earnings in 2012, 2013 saw a significant decrease in jobs and income earned by students.</p>
<p>“It is still early in the year, but if these figures are a continuation of the trends we saw last year we are concerned that fewer students are be able to find work when they need it.” Said Sycamore-Smith. “This is a great service which is free to both employers and students, it can cater for just about any job type, and if it’s seeing decreases in usage it is a real concern.”</p>
