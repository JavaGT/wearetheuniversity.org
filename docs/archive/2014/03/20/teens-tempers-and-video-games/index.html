<p>Is there any link between video games, aggressive behaviour and moral decision-making in teens?</p>
<p>A Massey University Master’s student is aiming to find out, and he’s looking for 40 North Shore-based participants aged 13-14 to help with his research.</p>
<p>“I’m looking at the connection, if any, between violent video games, moral decision-making and aggression in teenagers aged 13 to 14,” says Sam Payne.</p>
<p>“Video games these days are big sellers – and almost trade on their shock value. I want to find out if violence enacted against people in a virtual environment has any additional effect on the player of the game.”</p>
<p>Mr Payne’s supervisor, School of Psychology lecturer Dr Peter Cannon, says the study could provide valuable insights into teenagers’ brains.</p>
<p>“Mr Payne&#39;s research is valuable because we know that lots of teenagers regularly play violent video games, but we don&#39;t fully understand the effects that these games have on their aggression and moral decision-making. Teenagers’ brains are still developing, and this is particularly the case for the frontal cortex, which is involved in making everyday moral decisions,” he says.</p>
<p>Participants need to have a good understanding of English and will need to put aside 40 minutes to come to the Albany campus with a parent or guardian at a time that suits them. They will play a video game while having their facial muscle activity recorded, and undergo a couple of tests involving moral decision-making. All the data and information provided will remain confidential and anonymous, and all participants will receive a free Event Cinema movie ticket for their time.</p>
<p>Mr Payne will also provide access to a summary of the project findings to all participants.</p>
<p>For more information on the study, or to book a time, please contact Sam Payne by email: <a href="mailto:sampaynepayne@gmail.com">sampaynepayne@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>The project has been reviewed and approved by the Massey University Human Ethics Committee, Northern. Application 13/018.</p>
