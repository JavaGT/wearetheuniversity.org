<p><strong>Anti-racists outnumber white supremacists in CHCH</strong></p>
<p><em>Source: <a href="http://fightback.org.nz/2014/03/22/anti-racists-outnumber/">http://fightback.org.nz/2014/03/22/anti-racists-outnumber/</a></em></p>
<p>Over a hundred anti-racism protestors clashed with white supremacists led by Kyle Chapman Christchurch today.</p>
<p>Despite an attempt at tricking the count-protesters by changing at two hours’ notice the advertised location of the white-pride rally from New Brighton to Cathedral Square, over a hundred counter-protestors surrounded and outnumbered the 50 or so white supremacists, who were quickly drowned out by the chants of the anti-racism protestors, a number of whom had come from Dunedin, Wellington and Auckland to show solidarity with Christchurch anti-racist activists.</p>
<p>“The fact the racists need to hide their rally is a victory for us, and that they were stopped from preaching their hate” says Fightback member Ben Peterson.</p>
<p>Eventually the police had to escort the outnumbered white supremacists out of the square for their own safety.</p>
<p>“Obviously racism still exists, so it’s good that we stood up and shut them down today, however by chasing the white supremacists out of town doesn’t end racism, it’s much deeper than that in our society, we need to keep fighting to root it out,” says Fightback member Wei Son.</p>
<p>Over the course of the rally, organisers held a collection to raise money for the Refugee Council of Canterbury.</p>
