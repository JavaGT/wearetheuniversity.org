<p>David Cunliffe<br>Labour Leader</p>

<p><strong>Trust statement doesn’t get Hekia off hook</strong></p>
<p>Te Kohanga Reo Trust Board’s latest statement still leaves serious allegations of misuse of public money at Education Minister Hekia Parata’s door, says Labour Leader David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“The Minister should have insisted on a full review of trust subsidiary Te Pataka Ohanga when these matters came to light last year.</p>
<p>“Instead she set up an inquiry that failed to investigate the allegations of misspending, leading to a further waste of taxpayers’ money.</p>
<p>“The Minister tried to bury this information last week under cover of darkness with a hastily convened press conference at which she insisted there was no misuse of public money – a claim that has been widely ridiculed.</p>
<p>“The very next morning the Minister called in the Serious Fraud Office, doubtless having been told by her bosses that her management of the issue was shambolic.</p>
<p>“Ms Parata’s latest blunder comes on top of a procession of stuff-ups and high-handed pronouncements: performance-based funding for schools, larger class sizes, the Canterbury schools’ debacle, Charter Schools, and National Standards.</p>
<p>Labour welcomes moves by the trust to revamp their governance structure as a step towards regaining public confidence.</p>
<p>But this is no substitute for credible responses to critical questions that should have been answered months ago.</p>
<p>“No amount of bluster, bullying and passing the buck by the Minister over the alleged misspending gets her off the hook.&quot;</p>
<p>“Only her departure from this crucial portfolio will give Kiwis some hope that their children’s education and taxpayers’ hard-earned money are in safe hands,&quot; says David Cunliffe.</p>
