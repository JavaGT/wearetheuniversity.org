<p><strong>Maori Party Statement on Te Pataka Ohanga</strong></p>
<p>The Māori Party says it is extremely concerned about the alleged issues reported about Te Pataka Ohanga, and say it was the right thing to do to refer the matter to the Serious Fraud Office to investigate.</p>
<p>“The kohanga reo movement has been a key driver of Whanau Ora and Maori language revitalisation. It is a kaupapa that has been driven by Maori for Maori, in accordance with tikanga Maori, and it has touched thousands of our whanau across Aotearoa,” say Maori Party Co-leaders Tariana Turia and Te Ururoa Flavell.</p>
<p>“If there is any risk to the kaupapa of the kohanga reo then these issues need to be dealt with. If there is any doubt about the integrity of this kaupapa, then these issues must be put to rest, and swiftly.”</p>
<p>“Ministers Parata and Sharples did the right thing in referring the matter to the Serious Fraud Office. There is a huge public interest at stake. We as whanau all have a stake in this kaupapa, and we want to ensure it remains into the future. It’s time to open up and see what is going on.”</p>
<p>“This is a trying time for all of our whanau, but we must continue to be proud and have self-belief that we can address any challenges that we face,” say Maori Party Co-leaders.</p>
