<p>More than 100 Canterbury uni students to see latest quake-resistant buildings</p>
<p>March 30, 2014</p>
<p>More than 100 University of Canterbury (UC) civil engineering students will be taken into a construction site in Christchurch today to see innovative new seismic design technologies.</p>
<p>The final year civil engineering students year will see how new structures set the basis for earthquake engineering.</p>
<p>They will visit three new landmark inner city post-earthquake buildings – at 151 Cambridge Terrace, 53 Victoria Street, The Terraces and Knox Church on Bealey Ave.</p>
<p>Senior lecturer Dr Alessandro Palermo says the tour has been arranged with key structural engineering and construction companies playing important roles in the Christchurch rebuild.</p>
<p>``The students will see different technology for new buildings including base isolation which allow buildings to swing without sustaining any damage (similar to Te Papa Museum), sliding hinge joints for steel frames and concrete rocking columns.</p>
<p>``Although students have not started the second part of their course which deals with fundamentals of earthquake engineering, the purpose of the visit is to let them understand how a structure takes shape in the real world.</p>
<p>``It will inject passion, extra enthusiasm and motivation in the students for learning more about different materials.</p>
<p>``More importantly, this initiative creates a seamless interaction between the university and the post-quake construction industry. This is a vital key to success for UC and the Department of Civil and Natural Resources Engineering.</p>
<p>``These are the new generation of engineering students who will get to see exciting new developments in the city rebuild before they head out to launch their careers. There can’t be a better city in the world to be an engineer or engineering student right now that Christchurch as the city rebuild gains pace,’’ Dr Palermo says.</p>
<p>UC civil and structural engineering is ranked 19th among the top 3000 universities in the world, according to the latest QS rankings.</p>
