<p><strong>Wednesday, 12 March 2014, 9:55 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Government limits opportunity for Māori development  </p>
<p>The Government’s recent decision to cease funding for the only Māori Centre of Research Excellence – Ngā Pae o te Maramatanga – is a slap in the face for Māori research knowledge, said Labour’s Associate Research, Science and Innovation spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
<p>“It&#39;s clear the Māori Party have supported a funding decision which knee caps an institution that has grown the number of PhD graduates and research topics.</p>
<p>“Māori Innovation is key to enhancing and leveraging economic and social advancement.</p>
<p>“The Government cannot on the one hand talk about the huge contribution that Māori make to our country without supporting Maori knowledge and research capacity.</p>
<p>“This decision smacks of the short-sighted and narrow view of this Government led by Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce, which seeks to dismiss the value of Māori knowledge.</p>
<p>“A Labour government would support a centre of excellence for high quality Māori research to leverage the huge Māori economic base and to contribute to improved wellbeing outcomes.</p>
<p>“Labour is committed to growing New Zealand’s full potential as a nation and recognition of Māori knowledge is an important part of that goal,” Nanaia Mahuta says.</p>
