<p><strong>Maori Party congratulates newly announced Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples by the United Nations</strong></p>
<p>The Maori Party has congratulated Filipino indigenous leader and activist Victoria Tauli-Corpuz who has been named Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples by the United Nations.</p>
<p>“Vicky’s lifetime commitment and passion in her own country has been evident in the way in which she has supported the rights of indigenous peoples. Her ability to empathise, network and support other indigenous peoples across the world as well as working collaboratively and constructively with governments globally makes her an excellent choice,” says Maori Party Co-leader Tariana Turia.</p>
<p>“As an indigenous leader and activist, Victoria was among those who lobbied for more than 20 years before the United Nations General Assembly finally adopted on September 13, 2007 the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We mihi to her and look forward to working with her in the future,” says Dr Pita Sharples.</p>
<p>It’s expected that the formal appointment of Special Rapporteur mandate holders will be announced on March 28 during the last day of the 25th session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva.</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur will conduct thematic research on issues relevant to the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples, visit countries to observe and hear about the challenges faced by indigenous peoples and communicate with governments when human rights violations are alleged.</p>
<p>In 1996 Victoria Tauli-Corpuz founded Tebtebba, a non-government organization. She is also the convenor of the Asian Indigenous Women’s Network.</p>
