<p>Labour Leader</p>
<p>17 March 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Insurance industry drops ball on sum insured</strong></p>
<p>The insurance industry is overseeing a ticking time bomb with its move to sum insured leaving thousands of New Zealanders underinsured, which shows the need for a locally-owned company to raise standards, Labour Leader David Cunliffe says.</p>
<p>“The Insurance Ombudsman has today made it clear that in many cases insurance companies are not giving their customers an accurate idea of how much to insure their home for.</p>
<p>“The information sent to customers is too generic and, as the Ombudsman points out, is just plain wrong in some cases.</p>
<p>“Around 600,000 families could be underinsured. If their house burnt down they could be hundreds of thousands of dollars out of pocket.</p>
<p>“If there was another serious disaster families wouldn’t have the money to rebuild. At the moment sum insured is a ticking time bomb.</p>
<p>“The industry has insisted on moving to sum insured because it took a big hit after the Canterbury earthquakes. But it isn’t providing the information Kiwis need to make such a big decision.</p>
<p>“That’s not good enough. The industry needs to lift its game. That’s why Labour will introduce KiwiAssure - a KiwiBank-style insurance company that will raise standards and look after Kiwis first.</p>
<p>“Labour will closely monitor developments in the insurance industry, especially in Christchurch,” David Cunliffe says.</p>
