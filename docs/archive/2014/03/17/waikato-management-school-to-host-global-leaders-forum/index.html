<p><strong>Waikato Management School to Host Global Leaders Forum</strong></p>
<p>The move towards building a more entrepreneurial economy within New Zealand, and establishing stronger partnerships with important players in international markets, requires New Zealanders who understand how to lead in multi-cultural and multi-geographical environments, and can take their innovative products and services global.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato’s Management School has recognised this need for developing global leaders and will host a Global Leadership Forum targeting corporates in the Bay of Plenty, Waikato and South Auckland regions, as well as University of Waikato alumni and staff, on Monday 12 May.</p>
<p>Held at Claudelands Events Centre in Hamilton, this forum will provide participants with key insights designed to provoke, challenge, inform and inspire them with new perspectives for developing their leadership capability. There will also be ample opportunities to mix informally with keynote speakers, round table contributors and leaders in key industry sectors.</p>
<p>Featuring among the speakers is Unilever Europe President, Jan Zijderveld. Born in the Netherlands, Jan Zijderveld was educated in New Zealand, graduating from the University of Waikato with a management degree in 1987 before joining Unilever and embarking on his global career with this multinational consumer goods company. Also included in the line-up is Executive Director of Hawkins Construction, Jim Boult, who has been Director, Managing Director and Chairman of several substantial public and private companies; and Mai Chen, Founding Partner of Chen Palmer Public and Employment Law Specialists. Mai Chen is also best-selling author of <em>Public Law Toolbox</em> and was the inaugural Chair of New Zealand Global Women.</p>

<p>The programme will include an hour and a half round table discussion. Upon registration, participants will be invited to submit potential questions for this session which will involve a number of business leaders, including Kate Wilson (IP Strategist and Partner, James &amp; Wells), Mike Pohio (CEO, Tainui Group Holdings Limited), Neil Cowie (CEO, Mitre 10 NZ) and Neil Richardson (Businessman, Investor and Philanthropist).</p>
<p>“New Zealand is a country with a small market that is geographically quite distant from key economic centers. Because of these constraints New Zealand needs entrepreneurs with the leadership skills required to partner successfully with complementary businesses in key international markets,” says Waikato Management School Acting Dean Associate Professor, John Tressler.</p>
<p>“By holding this forum for the business people of our region we hope to build awareness of opportunities to partner internationally and encourage those who attend to further develop the required entrepreneurial and leadership skills to do this successfully”, he adds.</p>
