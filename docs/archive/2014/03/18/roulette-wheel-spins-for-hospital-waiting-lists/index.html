<p>Roulette Wheel Spins for Hospital Waiting Lists  </p>
<p>The Government is playing roulette with people’s health by spinning the wheel for hospital waiting lists, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“Today the media has highlighted a case of a woman who requires surgery, but she has been told she does not qualify for the waiting list,” says Spokesperson for Health Barbara Stewart.</p>
<p>“It is disheartening that the Government has set a test for the ‘level’ of need for surgery when clearly many thousands of people left off the waiting list are in dire need.</p>
<p>“In this case a woman has been told she only scored 60 out of 100 when 64 was needed to go on the waiting list.</p>
<p>“The many who do not win this game of roulette will be loaded up with painkillers and other drugs while waiting endlessly for surgery.</p>
<p>“While waiting to go on the waiting list their health will deteriorate and their quality of life will be compromised.</p>
<p>“By the time they get to surgery the toll on the health system’s dollars will be vastly more than if the surgery had been done much earlier.</p>
<p>“The National Government is using trickery to hide the true need.</p>
<p>“Even the medical profession is speaking out and questioning the management of the health system, pointing out that there is a hidden waiting list and saying doctors are frustrated by the constraints imposed by the Government’s targets,” says Mrs Stewart.</p>
