<p><strong>Key needs to get tips from China on restricting land sales</strong></p>
<p>John Key should get some tips on how China protects its economic interests through restricting land sales to foreign investors, Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman said today.</p>
<p>The Government has signalled to China it would be politically easier if it focused on leasing land in New Zealand rather than buying it outright.</p>
<p>“John Key knows that New Zealanders are growing increasingly concerned about the sale of both residential and farmland to overseas investors,” Dr Norman said.</p>
<p>“Earlier this month, Shanghai Pengxin, the company that bought the Crafar farms, was able to purchase another 4,000 hectares of farmland in South Canterbury.</p>
<p>“The Overseas Investment Office was happy to sign off this deal due to its importance to the Key Government’s China strategy.</p>
<p>“This failed economic strategy will see overseas investors being encouraged to purchase milk processing plants, farms and land so that they can control the entire value chain.</p>
<p>“John Key and National need to rethink their strategy and indeed look at how China successfully restricts land sales to overseas investors.</p>
<p>“It is not in New Zealand&#39;s long-term strategic economic interests to rubber stamp large-scale purchases of our farmland to overseas buyers whether they come from China, Australia or Sweden.</p>
<p>“A future Government involving the Green Party would look to progress legislation already drafted that would restrict foreign investors from purchasing New Zealand farmland.”</p>
