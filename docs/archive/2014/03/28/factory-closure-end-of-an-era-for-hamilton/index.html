<p>Factory closure end of an era for Hamilton</p>
<p>Today&#39;s closure of the Huttons factory in Hamilton is the end of an era which has provided incomes for generations of local families, Hamilton-based Labour MPs Sue Moroney and Nanaia Mahuta say.</p>
<p>&quot;The loss of these 120 jobs will hit the affected families and the Hamilton economy hard,” Sue Moroney said.</p>
<p>She said the region faced a bleak future under the current Government.</p>
<p>&quot;These job losses come on top of lay-offs announced at AgResearch&#39;s Ruakura campus, NZ Post, Huntly mines and Genesis Energy.”</p>
<p>Nanaia Mahuta said most of the Huttons staff were yet to find alternative employment.</p>
<p>&quot;Unemployment has remained high in the Waikato region and this closure will only add further pressure to the job market.</p>
<p>&quot;The region desperately needs a Government with a plan for economic development in heartland New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>Sue Moroney, who spearheaded a community initiative that looked for an alternative to the sale of the Huttons Factory to Hellars - which led to the closure - said it was disappointing the alternative bid wasn’t deemed acceptable to Goodman Fielder.</p>
<p>“That would have kept the factory operating,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Both MPs are working with FIRST Union to ensure the redundant workers are supported to find alternative work and get access to financial support.</p>
