<p><strong>Care Being Rationed as Staff Shortages Hit Healthcare</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First fears staff shortages are leading to the “rationing” of care in hospitals and other healthcare facilities.</p>
<p>“There are vacancies everywhere – we are very concerned about patient care being compromised,” says Health Spokesperson Barbara Stewart.</p>
<p>“Waikato District Health Board has 58 jobs listed on its website and Canterbury District Health Board has a list of 78.</p>
<p>“Less than a month ago more than 300 nurses working for the Southern District Health Board attended a stop-work meeting to discuss the lack of staff.</p>
<p>“Reports suggest there is ‘rationing of care’ in hospitals as the shortage of staff crisis worsens. Staff shortages are being accepted as normal and there is little active recruitment.</p>
<p>“Nurses and other healthcare employees are becoming overworked, they will become emotionally stressed as they worry about patient care and many will contemplate leaving the profession.</p>
<p>“Without adequate staffing, patients will not receive the standard of care that New Zealand prides itself in giving through our public health system.</p>
<p>“The Government is largely ignoring the plight of the healthcare sector and leaving it to struggle on – it’s time for the Minister to step up and confront the widespread issues,” says Mrs Stewart.</p>
