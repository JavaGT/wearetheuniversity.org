<p><strong>Super prices at supermarkets need explaining</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand’s supermarket duopoly needs to do some serious explaining as to why their fruit and vegetables are so pricey, Labour’s Consumer Rights spokesperson Carol Beaumont says.</p>
<p>“An Otago University <a href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/news/news/otago067315.html">report</a> shows Kiwi households are likely to be spending upwards of $2500 a year more on their fruit and veges if they buy them from a supermarket rather than their local market.</p>
<p>“Given ever increasing power prices and rising interest rates, there are not too many families that wouldn’t find an extra $49 a week in their pocket helpful.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately not everyone has access to a market, and the supermarkets know that.</p>
<p>“It’s past time for some transparency around pricing.</p>
<p>“Under this Government it seems the rewards are concentrated at the top. Lower down the food chain everyone else appears to be getting a raw deal.</p>
<p>“Supermarkets don’t have to wait for the Commerce Commission’s report to change their behaviour.</p>
<p>“They could start now - by bringing their fruit and vegetable prices into line with local sellers.”</p>
