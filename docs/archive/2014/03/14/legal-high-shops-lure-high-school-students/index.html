<p><strong>Friday, 14 March 2014, 3:14 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Legal High Shops Lure High School Students  </p>
<p>New Zealand First says the Minister of Police Anne Tolley has neglected the monitoring of legal high retailers and their customers.</p>
<p>Spokesperson for Social Policy/Welfare Le’aufa’amulia Asenati Lole-Taylor says many secondary school students are going into a legal high store in South Auckland during Polyfest, New Zealand’s premier secondary schools cultural festival in Manukau city.</p>
<p>“The numbers are alarming given that those under the age of 18 are not legally able to buy legal highs,” says Mrs Lole-Taylor.</p>
<p>“People are reporting seeing students entering the Heaven and Dreams legal high store on East Tāmaki Road in Papatoetoe, Auckland.</p>
<p>“The police have been informed about this but it is difficult for them to monitor these shops. The minister should give the police resources so they can monitor legal high retailers more effectively.</p>
<p>“The shop attracts students because it opens early.</p>
<p>“Many of these legal high shops are willing to sell to anyone. To discover that high school students are spending time in these stores shows the shop’s total disregard for the R18 restrictions under the Psychoactive Substances Act.</p>
<p>“Ultimately New Zealand First wants to see an outright ban on legal highs. Excited teenagers and easy access to legal substances is never going to be a good mix.</p>
<p>“We are well aware of the harmful physical and psychoactive effects of legal highs, and it is clear that nothing good can come from allowing legal highs to be sold in our communities.</p>
<p>“Legal highs are an unnecessary temptation for teenagers and we must keep these retailers accountable,” says Mrs Lole-Taylor.</p>
