<p><strong>Greens announce $1 million forestry award for building with hi-tech wood</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party in Government will put $1 million towards the cost of the first 10-storey or higher New Zealand building constructed with structural timber, Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman said today.</p>
<p>Structural timber is a relatively new construction technique for tall buildings with much of the technology developed here in New Zealand. These laminated timbers can be used as a smart, green alternative to the concrete and steel currently used for the load-bearing elements in high-rise buildings.</p>
<p>“We will create a $1 million award in government to encourage the wider uptake of structural timber in the building sector,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“The Canterbury rebuild presents a unique opportunity to use structural timber as a smarter, greener alternative to concrete and steel.</p>
<p>“The award is part of a bigger package of measures that will ensure forestry is our next high value export sector.</p>
<p>“Our exports of raw logs have surged while the local sawmilling and wood manufacturing industry has lost 4,000 jobs. Under National, we’ve seen a rapid simplification of our export base.</p>
<p>“This is not a smart way to run our economy.</p>
<p>“Rather than sending increasing amounts of low value-added raw logs overseas, the Green Party will encourage new technologies to be developed – such as structural timber – that will add value to our wood production and create good green jobs in New Zealand.”</p>

<p>Green Party forestry spokesperson, Steffan Browning, highlighted the high potential of structural timber buildings to lower carbon emissions and to add value to our log exports.</p>
<p>“Widespread adoption of structural timber in the building industry has the potential to substantially reduce the climate change impact of our building industry,” said Mr Browning.</p>
<p>“Timber buildings effectively become carbon sinks.</p>
<p>“Additionally, we can make our buildings lighter, stronger, and safer in an earthquake. St Elmo Courts is a six-storey structural timber building currently under construction in Christchurch and will be built to 180 per cent of the earthquake building code.</p>
<p>“Forestry can play a central part of a smarter, greener, more resilient economy.”</p>
