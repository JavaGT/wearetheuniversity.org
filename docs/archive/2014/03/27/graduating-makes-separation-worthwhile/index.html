<p>27 March 2014<br><strong>Graduating makes separation worthwhile</strong></p>
<p>Having her three-year-old son at her graduation will make the long separations Honiara had from him during her study all worthwhile.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato student will be graduating on 16 April at Claudelands Events Centre with a Master of Arts (Applied).</p>
<p>Honiara says leaving her son in Samoa with her parents and family whilst taking up a New Zealand Pacific Scholarship to study at the University of Waikato for two years wasn’t easy.</p>
<p>“When I left in 2012, he was only 10 months old, and being a single mother, it was excruciatingly difficult. During the time I was at Waikato, I would travel back and forth during my breaks just to see him, and the part I dreaded the most was leaving. It was heart-breaking!”</p>
<p>But Honiara says it was worth it.</p>
<p>“It motivated me to do well. I kept saying to myself, ‘you’re doing this for your son….your family and friends back home’, and it all paid off in the end.”</p>
<p>She says the support from her lecturers, work colleagues and Hamilton family was very helpful, especially returning to full-time study after many years.</p>
<p>“My close friends at Orchard Hall were always there to encourage and support me during tough times. Often I would turn up at my lecturers’ doors unannounced if I needed help with assignments and they would always make the time to see me and help me with whatever I was working on.”</p>
<p>Honiara says the highlights of her study were two of the course papers she completed on language teaching.</p>

<p>“I thoroughly enjoyed these courses as they focussed on the overall development of teaching skills and on the preparation and delivery of a series of purposeful and focussed language lessons for second-language speakers of English we had to teach.”</p>
<p>Also attending her graduation will be Honiara’s parents and sisters, her nephew, cousins and an aunty, all from Samoa, and relatives from Auckland, Hamilton and Wellington.</p>
<p>Honiara has now resumed her position as a Lecturer in Communication Studies in the Media &amp; Communications Department at the National University of Samoa. She says studying at Waikato University has enhanced her understanding of theory and practice in language teaching, and enriched her professional life.</p>
<p>“I absolutely enjoyed my two years at Waikato University and would recommend it to any colleagues who were thinking of pursuing further studies. And if given the opportunity to study again, I would go back to Waikato.”</p>
