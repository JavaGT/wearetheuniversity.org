<p>Student loan changes criminalising a generation</p>
<p>The Government’s new regime against student loan defaulters is nothing but a cheap gimmick which will do little to improve debt repayment, Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Grant Robertson says.</p>
<p>“Arresting defaulters at the border will simply put educated and skilled Kiwis off returning to New Zealand.</p>
<p>“It won’t result in a large increase in student loan repayments and the Government has admitted as much.</p>
<p>“This new law is turning what was a civil issue into a criminal issue and in the process criminalising a generation of Kiwis.</p>
<p>“The police have said they don’t have the resources to enforce these changes.</p>
<p>“If the Government is serious about student loan debt, it shouldn’t cut students’ access to student allowances, forcing them to increase their loans.</p>
<p>“Repaying student loans is already financially crippling for many people after the Government increased repayments to 12 cents in every dollar earned.</p>
<p>“Labour wants to encourage repayment of loans and for borrowers to meet their obligations, in a fair-handed way. Inland Revenue needs to be supported to work out payment plans with borrowers that are sustainable and actually see money paid back.</p>
<p>“All New Zealanders will benefit from that rather than the disingenuous gimmick that National has provided,” Grant Robertson says.</p>
