<p>UC to set up an architect in residence</p>
<p>March 7, 2014</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury will, for the first time, set up an Architect in Residence within its College of Engineering.</p>
<p>The residency has support from Sir Miles Warren’s Warren Architects Education Charitable Trust and from former graduate Jim Rutherford.</p>
<p>Professor Mark Davidson says the trust and Rutherford have been crucial in creating the new position.</p>
<p>``The Architect in Residence will provide a catalyst for developing more systematic and effective interaction between the architectural and engineering professions.</p>
<p>``More specifically, this unique initiative will provide important opportunities to broaden the education of our engineering students in an architectural context.</p>
<p>``The residency will also contribute to our education and research activities in earthquake engineering at the postgraduate level, where UC has considerable expertise and there is a need to further develop that specialist expertise in an architectural context,’’ Professor Davidson, head of civil and natural resources engineering, says.</p>
<p>Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Engineering Professor Jan Evans-Freeman says the residency is an exciting move for the Department of Civil and Natural Resources Engineering in particular.</p>
<p>``In their professional lives, architects and engineers work closely together and this will be an opportunity for us to foster those types of collaborations at a graduate level.</p>
<p>``We are also seeking to encourage architectural students from overseas to visit Christchurch and this appointment provides a direct link for them with the University.</p>
<p>``This is a time of optimism for engineering at UC. Our civil and structural engineering section has just been ranked 19th in the world among the top 3000 universities by the London-based ranking company QS.’’</p>
