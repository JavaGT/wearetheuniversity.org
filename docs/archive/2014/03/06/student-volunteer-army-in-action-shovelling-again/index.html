<p><strong>Student Volunteer Army swinging into action shovelling – again</strong></p>
<p><strong>March 6, 2014</strong></p>
<p>The University of Canterbury Student Volunteer Army (SVA) has mobilised into action, shovelling mud from this week’s torrential flooding.</p>
<p>SVA president Bridget Williams says they received a call for help today from the Heathcote Valley School.</p>
<p>``They called on us to help clear the streets and paths around the school in the Heathcote Valley so children could get to and from school.</p>
<p>``We’ve been out there today, in one of the hardest-hit parts of Christchurch, just as we did after the earthquakes three years ago. We’ve also had the school students helping us and we have been mentoring them too.</p>
<p>``We’re calling on anyone in Christchurch to help us tomorrow and over the weekend. There’s a lot of mud, rubbish and blocked drains from the storm that needs to be tidied up.</p>
<p>``It’s a big job but we’re keen to help the community and we’re also asking the Christchurch Polytechnic SVA to help us too.</p>
<p>If anyone is interested they can meet us at the University of Canterbury Students’ Association carpark at 9am tomorrow,’’ Williams says.</p>
