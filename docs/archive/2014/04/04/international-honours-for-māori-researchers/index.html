<p><strong>Māori Party celebrates international honours for Māori researchers</strong></p>
<p>The Māori Party congratulates the two Māori recipients of prestigious AERA Fellowships that are being presented in Philadelphia today to Professor Linda Tuhiwai Smith of Ngāti Awa and Ngāti Porou, and Distinguished Professor Graham Hingangaroa Smith of Ngāti Apa, Ngāti Porou, Ngāti Kahungunu and Kai Tahu.</p>
<p>The American Educational Research Association is the centre of a global network of education researchers, and Fellowships are awarded by expert practitioners to recognise sustained excellence in the field. University of Waikato Pro Vice-Chancellor Māori Professor Linda Smith and her husband Distinguished Professor Graham Smith, the CEO of Te Whare Wānanga o Awanuiārangi based in Whakatane, are the only two New Zealanders among 22 Fellows to be inducted this year.</p>
<p>“It is gratifying to see the work of our leading academics and scholars being recognised by their professional peers around the world,” says Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell.</p>
<p>“Both Linda and Graham are teachers and educators who have gone on to make outstanding contributions to developing kaupapa Māori research and education methodologies, so that research design and educational pedagogy reflect indigenous world views and help indigenous communities to achieve their own goals.”</p>
<p>“As academics, they have written seminal texts and papers, mentored a whole generation of outstanding students, and overseen research projects that have transformed communities across Aotearoa and around the world,” says Dr Pita Sharples.</p>

<p>“They are leading contributors to international forums and debates on indigenous theory and practice in research and education, and strategies for indigenous communities to regain control of their own destiny for future generations.”</p>
<p>“They have also devoted time and effort to support New Zealand’s national research bodies and professional associations including the Health Research Council, the Marsden Fund Council and the NZ Association for Research in Education,” says Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>“It is wonderful that their insight and passion has been recognised by their peers around the world. This emphasises really the crucial importance of the pioneering indigenous Centre of Research Excellence Ngā Pae o te Māramatanga which has consolidated and promoted their transformational approach,” says Co-leader Tariana Turia.</p>
<p>“The Māori Party certainly hopes the Minister of Tertiary Education takes note of the high esteem in which Professors Graham and Linda Smith are held, as reflected in these fellowships, and considers how their work can best be honoured in their homeland.”</p>
