<p>Grant Robertson - Labour MP</p>
<p>20 April 2014<br>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>MP to attend progressive politics conference</p>
<p>Labour MP Grant Robertson will attend the Progressive Governance conference in Amsterdam later this week.</p>
<p>“This conference brings together Social Democratic parties from around the world to discuss how progressive politics should work in the post global financial crisis environment.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a great opportunity to learn from other social democratic parties, and like minded commentators and academics, about how to meet the economic and social challenges facing our countries.</p>
<p>“The global financial crisis has put into stark relief the limitations of the neo-liberal economic model. Conferences like this are an opportunity to answer the question of what is the social democratic alternative. It is also a chance to share ideas for campaigning and building a strong movement for progressive change.</p>
<p>“The progressive governance network was launched in 1999 by Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and others to bring together centre-left political thinkers from around the world.</p>
<p>“The theme for this year&#39;s conference is ‘Making Progressive Politics Work’. It will include presentations from the likes of Jens Stoltenberg (former prime minister of Norway), the Ministers of Finance from the Netherlands and Finland, and leading thinkers including Will Hutton and Anthony Giddens.</p>
<p>“I will participate in a panel on the future of progressive politics,” Grant Robertson says.</p>
<p>Note: The costs for Grant Robertson&#39;s participation are being met personally and through contributions from the conference organisers.</p>
