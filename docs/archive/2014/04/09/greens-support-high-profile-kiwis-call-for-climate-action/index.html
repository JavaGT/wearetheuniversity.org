<p>Greens support high profile Kiwis’ call for climate action  </p>
<p>The Green Party fully supports a group of high profile Kiwi business people, lawyers, academics and commentators delivering a petition to parliament today calling for the Government to take the threat of climate change more seriously.</p>
<p>Wiseresponse, a group of over 100 high-profile New Zealanders, will hand the petition over at 1pm, calling for Parliament to carry out a cross-party assessment of the risks associated with energy and climate change, as well as four other key areas of concern.</p>
<p>The Green Party’s climate change spokesperson Dr Kennedy Graham will meet them.</p>
<p>“Wiseresponse has rightly identified climate change as a threat to New Zealand and our way of life. Any Government that does not take it seriously is failing to protect New Zealand,” said Dr Graham.</p>
<p>“The petition comes just days after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its report into the likely impacts of climate change in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The IPCC report was a massive wake up call, and so it’s great that we have this prominent group of New Zealanders calling on the Government to take the scientists’ warnings seriously.</p>
<p>“Like all Kiwis, the Green Party loves our country and we want to protect it from the worst impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>“As Wiseresponse points out, we cannot keep allowing economic development to come at the expense of our environment, when it’s the environment that underpins the economy in the first place.</p>
<p>“Taking climate change seriously and moving to a smarter, greener and more resilient economy is a huge opportunity – I hope National, and indeed all Kiwis, listen to the voices of these well-respected New Zealanders as they call for action to protect the Kiwi way of life.”</p>
