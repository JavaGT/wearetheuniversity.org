<p><strong>Board appointment for senior lecturer</strong></p>
<p>University of Waikato Screen and Media Studies senior lecturer Dr Gareth Schott has been appointed to the Government’s Film and Literature Board of Review for three years.</p>
<p>The board reviews publications that have been classified by the Office of Film and Literature Classification.</p>
<p>Publications include, but are not limited to, any film, video recording, DVD, CD Rom, disc, electronic or computer file, book, magazine, newspaper, photograph or sound recording.</p>
<p>The nine member board is appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister of Internal Affairs.</p>
<p>Dr Schott’s appointment comes on the back of two Marsden grants to study video gaming, including one to research video game classifications.</p>
<p>“My research to-date has aimed to support classification processes by more clearly distinguishing between the different experiences offered by games, compared to film. I have argued for the need to articulate those differences in experience more clearly when informing the public why games have achieved a particular age-restriction.”</p>
