<p><strong>Wednesday, 9 April 2014, 12:00 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Mayor’s jobs initiative shows up inactive Govt</p>
<p>Auckland Mayor Len Brown and the Auckland Council are to be congratulated for providing opportunities for young people to get into work, but it stands in stark contrast to the National Government overseeing spiralling youth unemployment, Labour’s Employment, Skills and Training spokesperson Grant Robertson says.</p>
<p>“Len Brown’s Youth Employment Traction Plan is a practical response to the one in five young Aucklanders who are not in work, and builds on the successful Youth Connections policy.</p>
<p>“The Council is showing leadership in taking on more cadets and graduates, and working with employers, as have other local authorities through the Mayors’ Taskforce for Jobs.</p>
<p>“This focus on getting young people into work or training stands in contrast to National which has overseen a huge increase in unemployed young people, particularly in the Maori and Pacific communities.</p>
<p>“There are now 72,000 young New Zealanders not in employment, education or training; 11,000 more than when National took office.</p>
<p>“It is the Government’s responsibility to ensure all young New Zealanders are given the support and opportunities to get into work and training. National has failed to make this a priority.</p>
<p>“A Labour government will make sure all young New Zealanders are in work, education or training by supporting schools, employers and training providers to work more closely together to ensure there is an appropriate transition from school for every student.</p>
<p>“Nothing less is necessary for the future of New Zealand,” Grant Robertson says.</p>
