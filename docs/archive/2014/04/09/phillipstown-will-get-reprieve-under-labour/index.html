<p><strong>Wednesday, 9 April 2014, 11:31 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Phillipstown will get reprieve under Labour</p>
<p>A Labour government will allow Phillipstown School to stay open, with a review after two years, Labour’s Associate Education spokesperson Megan Woods says.</p>
<p>“Hekia Parata has failed the Phillipstown community with today’s decision to close the school.</p>
<p>“It is disgraceful that even after the courts over-ruled her initial botched process, she has ploughed on with her pre-determined plan to strip this community of its local schools.</p>
<p>“The school’s merger has been decided without any real evidence that it is best for the community, or the teachers, parents and students.</p>
<p>“A Labour government would grant the school and the community’s request to allow the school to remain open, reviewing it once it had looked at population projections and other pertinent information.</p>
<p>“At the beginning of March, the school pleaded for more time to make its case. It is not good enough that the Minister refused to consider that request, despite the school having to close for the day due to the Christchurch floods. Let’s not forget that this community was only forced to go through this process again because of the Minister’s failure to follow the law.</p>
<p>“This is a local community that really wants and needs a local school. It deserves praise for standing up and fighting for what it believes in.</p>
<p>“This isn’t the first time Hekia Parata’s decision-making has been under serious scrutiny and it’s unlikely to be the last if she continues not to listen.</p>
<p>“Labour believes in real consultation and involving communities in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>“The next Labour government will not ride rough-shod over communities as Hekia Parata has done,” said Megan Woods.</p>
