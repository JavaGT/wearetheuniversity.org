<p>Climate change impacts tuatara population</p>
<p>A new study involving researchers from Victoria University of Wellington shows climate change could ultimately result in the extinction of a population of tuatara.</p>
<p>Dr Nicky Nelson, Dr Kristine Grayson and Susan Keall from Victoria’s School of Biological Sciences, in collaboration with the Department of Conservation and University of Western Australia, provide a case study of a natural population of tuatara on North Brother Island in the Cook Strait of New Zealand.</p>
<p>The research, published this week in the international scientific journal PLOS ONE, shows that as a result of warming temperatures, there is an accelerating decline in the proportion of adult female tuatara in the population.</p>
<p>“Our research reveals that as the male-bias in the population increases, female tuatara body condition, fertility rates and survival decline,” says Dr Nelson.</p>
<p>Projected temperature increases for New Zealand are expected to further tip the hatchling sex ratio towards males—owing to the pattern of temperature-dependent sex determination in tuatara where males hatch at warmer temperatures.</p>
<p>Dr Nelson says understanding the mechanisms underlying population declines is critical for preventing the extinction of endangered populations.</p>
<p>“If we understand the causes of decline for species, we can consider our options for management, particularly under the various scenarios for climate warming.”</p>
<p>Population viability models predict that without management, intervention or an evolutionary response the North Brother Island population will ultimately be made up entirely of males and become extinct.</p>
<p>The study demonstrates that the sex ratio in tuatara populations can be an underappreciated threat to long-term viability, particularly in populations that appear numerically stable.</p>
