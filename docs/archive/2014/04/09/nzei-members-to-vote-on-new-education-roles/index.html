<p><strong>NZEI members to vote on new education roles</strong></p>
<p>8 April 2014</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa wants the Government to produce the details of its $360-million “executive principal” and “expert teacher” package so it can discuss the proposals with members.</p>
<p>NZEI National Secretary Paul Goulter says teachers and principals are extremely cynical about the new package because it totally ignores the biggest problem in our education system – the one in four kids who live in poverty and the impact of that on New Zealand’s student success.</p>
<p>The National Executive met this evening to discuss the teachers’ and principals’ reaction to the proposal and the next steps after holding earlier meetings with members around the country.</p>
<p>“The feedback from our members has been very clear. They have seen no evidence that the proposal will lift student success.</p>
<p>“They are not happy about the process and lack of consultation.</p>
<p>“What happens now is that we expect the Government to make a claim to vary our teacher and principal collective agreements to allow for the introduction of the new roles.</p>
<p>“We will be taking the whole package back to our members so for the first time they can see the whole proposal.</p>
<p>“Our National Executive is asking our members to give a clear direction on whether they want negotiations to vary the collective agreements to commence or whether they want nothing to do with the new roles.</p>
<p>“Our members will decide those next steps at a series of paid union meetings to be held following the receipt of the Government’s claims.”</p>
