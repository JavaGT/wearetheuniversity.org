<p><strong>Wednesday, 2 April 2014, 4:07 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>David<br>PARKER</p>
<p>Spokesperson for Finance</p>
<p>2 April 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Labour fact check: Key’s twists and turns in speech</strong></p>
<p>John Key has yet again twisted the figures and selectively chosen his statistics, a fact check by Labour shows, says Labour’s Finance spokesperson David Parker.</p>
<p>“John Key has a long history of getting away with misstatements that range from an honest mistake to worse. Today Labour is calling him out with a list of the misrepresentations in his speech.</p>
<p>“Labour is determined to hold John Key and his spin doctors to account ahead of election year,” says David Parker.</p>
<p><em>Key: Over the past year, for example, 66,000 more people have got a job.</em></p>
<p>Over the past two years, unemployment has fallen by only 4000 (from 151 thousand to 147 thousand)</p>
<p><em>Key: Average weekly wages have gone up 2.8 per cent, compared to inflation of only 1.6 per cent.</em></p>
<p>Under the Labour Cost Index – the measure of wage rates, Salary and ordinary time wage rates increased by 1.6% - an zero increase in real terms.</p>
<p><em>Key: And the economy as a whole has grown 3.1 per cent – one of the faster growth rates in the developed world.</em></p>
<p>The annual growth rate is 2.7 per cent - Key is misleading the public by using the quarter-on-quarter annual growth rate. Annual year-on-year growth is a much more robust measure of growth as it covers a broader time period (a year, rather than three months). This is the measure that Treasury uses in its forecasts.</p>

<p><em>Key: We have had an on-going commitment to discipline around government spending and that will continue this year, next year and for as long as we lead the Government.</em></p>
<p>National has increased debt by $60 billion in office, the worst of any in government (in nominal terms) and the worst since Muldoon as a percentage of GDP.</p>
<p><em>Key: One way to illustrate our approach is this – in the last five years of the previous Labour government, new operating spending each budget averaged $2.7 billion a year.</em></p>
<p>Every year Labour posted large surpluses and paid down debt. National has yet to do this once, after more than five years in office.</p>
<p><em>Key: In the last five years of Labour, government spending in total went up 50 per cent.</em></p>
<p>In the last five years of Labour we introduced Working for Families, interest free Student loans and Kiwi Saver – all paid for out of growth. None of which National has repealed .</p>
<p><strong>Total Government expenses</strong></p>
<p>Labour:</p>
<p>$55.2b to $75.8b from Budget 2003 to Budget 2008: Increase of $20.6b (37 per cent)</p>
<p>National:</p>
<p>$75.8b to $91.0b from Budget 2008 to Budget 2013: Increase of $15.2b (20 per cent)</p>
<p><strong>Total Government Revenue</strong></p>
<p>Labour:</p>
<p>$57.0b to $81.5b from Budget 2003 to Budget 2008: Increase of $24.5b (43 per cent)</p>
<p>National:</p>
<p>$81.5b to $86.7b from Budget 2008 to Budget 2013: Increase of $5.2b (6 per cent)</p>
<p><strong>Net government debt (excluding Super Fund):</strong></p>
<p>Labour:</p>
<p>$17.6b to $10.3b from Budget 2003 to Budget 2008 (-43 per cent)</p>
<p>National:</p>
<p>$10.3b to $55.8b from Budget 2008 to Budget 2013 (+442 per cent)</p>
