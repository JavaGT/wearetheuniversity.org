<p>Ruth<br>DYSON<br>Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson</p>
<p>29 April 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT  </p>
<p><strong>The people of Christchurch deserve answers</strong></p>
<p>As the city of Christchurch faces its third destructive flood in less than two months its people want answers, says Labour’s Canterbury Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Ruth Dyson.</p>
<p>“Local residents are feeling really despondent and some are talking about being re-traumatised by the floods.</p>
<p>“It has to be a priority for the Council to now act over some of the suggestions that ratepayers and citizens have made over the past month in public meetings.</p>
<p>“So far the Council has not come back with any feedback on these suggestions.</p>
<p>“Today the Banks Peninsula has been hit by more slips, the Heathcote River has gain burst its banks and over 23 roads are closed.</p>
<p>“People have spent three years battling the aftermath of the earthquakes and they now have to deal with flooding. It is just too much for some people.</p>
<p>“The people of Christchurch need some resolutions.”</p>
