<p><strong>Canterbury postgraduate music student back from New York to give performances</strong></p>
<p>April 29, 2014</p>
<p>One of New Zealand’s most talented young musicians and University of Canterbury honours graduate student will return home next month to give a series of performances.</p>
<p>Bryony Gibson-Cornish, a Fulbright scholar, will give recitals in Christchurch and Auckland before returning to New York in September.</p>
<p>After graduating with first class honours from Canterbury, Gibson-Cornish moved to New York in 2012 to pursue a Master of Music degree at The Juilliard School. Chamber music is her passion and this year she will perform with Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra as its young soloist of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been studying and performing this last year and from September I’ll also be pursuing research through Juilliard’s prestigious scholastic distinction programme.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope to discover how baroque music practices such as improvisation can influence 21st century musicians in their interpretation and process of learning solo instrumental works by Johann Sebastian Bach.</p>
<p>&quot;`Before moving to New York I had two wonderful teachers in Stephen Larsen (viola) and Dame Malvina Major (voice) whom I studied with while at the Pettman National Junior Academy of Music and at the University of Canterbury, when I began my Bachelor of Music at 15.</p>
<p>&quot;I love that music is a universal language and that we are able to communicate our emotions through any given melody. I am also an adrenaline junkie – the exhilaration that I experience when performing is absolutely addictive.</p>
<p>&quot;I live on that buzz of being able to perform and share my music with others. All the hours of practice and rehearsal are worth it after a successful performance.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that New Zealand is an incredible place to be for a young musician for many reasons. Our small population makes the country a unique place for musicians to develop, because there are more professional opportunities for young people than in other countries.</p>
<p>&quot;Part of my musical upbringing involved playing in orchestras, particularly the NZSO National Youth Orchestra and the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra. I was also lucky enough to be the NZSO’s inaugural fellowship student in 2010 which gave me incredible insight into how an orchestra works.</p>
<p>&quot;I have had an incredible time here at Juilliard. It took a while to settle into living in New York City. But now I am very comfortable living here and I have been able to grow, as a musician and person, in ways I never thought possible.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the highlights have been playing in the Juilliard Orchestra and the historical performance ensemble, Juilliard415. It is exhilarating to play with such talented musicians.&quot;</p>
<p>Head of the University of Canterbury’s School of Music Dr Glenda Keam says she is delighted to hear of Gibson-Cornish’s continuing successes as a performing musician and as an academic studying performance practice.</p>
<p>&quot;Her musical talents were recognised from a young age while she was a student at Rangi Ruru Girls&#39; School and through her time at the School of Music here.</p>
<p>&quot;Many opportunities provided by Christchurch, such as performing in the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra from the age of 14, have contributed to a career path which now sees her studying and being a mentor at one of the great international music schools, The Juilliard School in Manhattan. I wish her all the best for her ongoing musical journeys.&quot;</p>
