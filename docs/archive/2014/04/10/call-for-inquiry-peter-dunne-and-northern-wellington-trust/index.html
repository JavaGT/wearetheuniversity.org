<p><strong>Green Party requests inquiry into Peter Dunne and Northern Wellington Trust</strong></p>
<p>Green Party MP Denise Roche today wrote to the Parliamentary Registrar of Pecuniary Interests requesting an inquiry into whether Peter Dunne should have included his involvement as chair of the Northern Wellington Festival Trust on the Register of Pecuniary Interests earlier than 2013.</p>
<p>The Associate Minister of Health, with responsibility for problem gambling services, Peter Dunne today admitted in the House that he had omitted to alert the Register of Pecuniary Interests of his involvement as chair of the Northern Wellington Festival Trust. The Northern Wellington Festival Trust seeks and receives funding for a Santa parade from pokie trusts.</p>
<p>“There is the potential for a conflict of interest when the Minister that oversees funding for gambling harm minimisation is also chair of an organisation that seeks pokie funding,” Green Party gambling spokesperson Denise Roche said today.</p>
<p>“Peter Dunne today admitted in parliament that he should probably have declared his interest in the Northern Wellington Festival Trust earlier than 2013.</p>
<p>“Mr Dunne needs to explain how - given he has been chair of the Wellington Northern Festival Trust for many years - it was only in 2013 that he considered it worthwhile putting this on the record.</p>
<p>“The Northern Wellington Festival Trust has received tens of thousands of dollars from pokie trusts.</p>
<p>“Mr Dunne has also actively campaigned in his electorate on the work he does with the Northern Wellington Festivals,” Ms Roche.</p>

<p>“He receives a direct benefit from his association with this organisation.</p>
<p>“Mr Dunne today stated that he welcomed scrutiny into his dealings with the Northern Wellington Festival Trust.</p>
<p>“As he is currently the Minister in charge of the gambling levy, the public health protections for problem gambling and involved in the regulation of the industry, it is important any dealing he has with organisations seeking pokie money are looked into properly,” Ms Roche said.</p>
