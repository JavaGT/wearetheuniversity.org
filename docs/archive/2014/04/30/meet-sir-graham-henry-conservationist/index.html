<p><strong>Meet Sir Graham Henry, conservationist</strong></p>
<p>Wildbase at Massey, New Zealand’s only dedicated wildlife hospital, will be getting a boost on Thursday night with an exclusive fundraising event in Auckland featuring Sir Graham Henry.</p>
<p>The Rugby World Cup-winning coach, who is also a Massey Distinguished Alumni winner, will speak about his experiences in a high performance environment before taking questions from the audience. Sir Graham is a committed conservationist and is generously donating his time to speak.</p>
<p>Massey University Foundation and Alumni director Ms Mitch Murdoch says Sir Graham and Lady Henry are both tremendous supporters of Wilbase at Massey. Lady Raewyn Henry is a Wildbase Ambassador with a strong interest in animals.</p>
<p>“We are so grateful to Sir Graham for donating his time, and helping Wildbase at Massey to achieve its plan to expand the hospital facilities and be able to help more wildlife,” she says. “This will radically improve the care and survival of wild patients and eliminate the need to turn patients away due to lack of space.”</p>
<p>The event starts at 6pm and is hosted at KPMG’s Viaduct Harbour offices. On-street parking is available.</p>
<p>Registration for the evening is $50 including GST, which includes complimentary drinks and canapes, and attendance is limited.</p>
