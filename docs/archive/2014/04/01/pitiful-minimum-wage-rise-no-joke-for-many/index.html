<p>Pitiful minimum wage rise no joke for many</p>
<p>The minimum wage rise taking effect today is too little and too late and will do nothing for working New Zealanders who rely on it, Labour Leader David Cunliffe says.</p>
<p>“The cost of housing, whether renting or buying, is now so out of kilter with the ability of low income families to pay the bills that another few dollars a week will go nowhere near making up the shortfall.</p>
<p>“The brutal reality for these workers is they are not getting their fair share and this is contributing to growth in income inequality and family poverty.</p>
<p>“That’s confirmed by the fact almost two-thirds of New Zealanders feel they are no better off or have gone backwards, in the six years National has been in government.</p>
<p>“Not only that, but in real terms median wages have dropped in many regions over the same period.</p>
<p>“National has also failed to address the lack of minimum wage protection for thousands of vulnerable contractors and cut the pay of young minimum wage workers.</p>
<p>“It had a chance to stick up for our lowest paid workers and help make a real difference to their lives and those of their children, but once again turned its back on them.</p>
<p>“Labour would do better – raising the minimum wage to $15 within its first 100 days in Government, followed by another rise in 2015. We would also address the lack of minimum wage protection for vulnerable contractors,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
