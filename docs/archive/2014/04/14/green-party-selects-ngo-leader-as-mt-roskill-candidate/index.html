<p><strong>Monday, 14 April 2014, 11:25 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Green Party selects high profile NGO leader as Mt Roskill candidate</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party has selected former Oxfam New Zealand Executive Director Barry Coates as its candidate for the Mt. Roskill electorate. Barry recently stepped down from Oxfam after ten years. He brings an enormous range of skills and experiences to his new role as a candidate.</p>
<p>Barry commented: “I am honoured to represent the Green Party in Mt. Roskill electorate. My aim is to provide Mt Roskill voters with the opportunity to party vote Green as the best way to achieve political change in this forthcoming election. I look forward to meeting people across this diverse electorate and explaining why a vote for Green is a positive vote for the issues they care about.”</p>
<p>“I am campaigning for the Green party vote at this election because we need a change of direction. The Green party has credible policies to create more jobs in a smarter economy, decent incomes, better education, better transport and affordable housing. Instead the Government has prioritised tax cuts for the rich and the interests of big business ahead of the welfare of the people of Mt. Roskill and other electorates. The voters of Mt. Roskill need a change of government.”</p>
<p>“There is support for the Green Party agenda in Mt. Roskill. The voters have expressed their concern over Government policies on asset sales, mining in unique environments, risky deep sea oil drilling, subsidies for fossil fuels, mass surveillance of New Zealand citizens and shady deals to promote socially-destructive gambling. We must protect our unique environment and take urgent action on climate change. The Greens offer a better direction and that’s what I will be talking to voters about.”</p>

<p>“The issues of small business and a new direction for our economy are crucial. The young people Mt. Roskill should have job opportunities in the growth sectors for the future. The Greens, as part of a coalition government, will take advantage of exciting new opportunities in the green economy and put in place the policies that create new jobs, build skills, add value to our resources and strengthen our green reputation internationally.”</p>
<p>“We need to reduce the burden on families who are struggling to afford the basics. Families should not have to pay for the price rip-offs we have seen in electricity, telecoms, finance, milk and food. We need better regulation of companies to ensure there is fair competition in our domestic economy.”</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br>Barry Coates was Executive Director at Oxfam New Zealand from September 2003 to March 2014. He has worked extensively in Asia and the Pacific, focusing on reducing poverty and supporting communities to have better lives. He has led international and New Zealand campaigns on climate change, international trade and social welfare.</p>
<p>Barry has been closely involved with political issues, giving evidence to Parliamentary Committees, advising Ministers and building public support for policy change. Barry has a degree in Economics, a Masters from Yale University and has experience of corporate strategy and sustainable business. Barry is a fourth generation Aucklander who lives in the Mt. Roskill electorate.</p>
