<p>The meeting will include a speech, a question and answer session for members, and the confirmation vote. It will be followed by light refreshments. Media are welcomed to cover the speech, in which Macbeth Dann will outline his ideas for the campaign, the issues he sees affecting the electorate, and his vision for change that benefits all the people of Ilam.</p>

<p>James Macbeth Dann Bio:</p>
<p>James Macbeth Dann was born and raised in Christchurch, as has lived here most of his life. He studied at Otago University in Dunedin, completing Biochemistry and Classics degrees, before returning to Ilam where he worked on a Masters in Cellular and Molecular Biology. He is currently researching a PhD thesis in endometrial cancer, which he will suspend to concentrate on the Ilam campaign.</p>
<p>Macbeth Dann has been a strong activist voice in the city, with a key role in the water rights movement that sprang up after the National government sacked the democratically-elected ECan council. Since the quakes, he has been a widely-read commentator on the recovery, featuring in the Christchurch Mail, the Press, the Herald and the Guardian UK. He is also keenly involved in the arts, and the transitional city movement, such as FESTA, Agropolis and Gap Filler, as well being a board member of contemporary arts space the Physics Room.</p>
