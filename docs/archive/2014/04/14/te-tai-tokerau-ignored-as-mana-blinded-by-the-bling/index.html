<p><strong>Te Tai Tokerau Ignored as Mana Blinded by the Bling</strong></p>
<p>The voice of Te Tai Tokerau is silent as the Mana Party makes a whole lot of noise about who it will form an alliance with.</p>
<p>As Mana falls apart because it is unsure whether it represents the poor or uber-rich, promises made by the party’s leader Hone Harawira at the 2011 by-election have not been kept, says Labour Te Tai Tokerau spokesperson Hadyn Edmonds.</p>
<p>Mr Edmonds says division within the ranks of Mana is emerging as it struggles with its rich vs. poor identity crises at a cost of those in Te Tai Tokerau.</p>
<p>“Labour&#39;s Te Tai Tokerau candidate Kelvin Davis remains firmly focused on the real needs of the region.</p>
<p>“The educational achievement of Maori students is still behind non-Maori in terms of success and Kelvin has a proven track record of making rapid gains in raising Maori achievement.</p>
<p>“There’s a housing shortage which has not been addressed and has become critical.</p>
<p>“Despite promises made by Hone Harawira at the by-election that it would be easy to create full employment by Christmas 2011 we are yet to see the results.</p>
<p>“It is time for creating real work opportunities in the north through strong economic development and not the false hope of more idle promises.</p>
<p>“Mana&#39;s mess is self-inflicted and the result of their leader going weak at the knees when he saw the dollar signs radiating in Kim Dotcom&#39;s smile,” says Mr Edmonds.</p>
