<p><strong>Monday, 14 April 2014, 12:29 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>David Cunliffe<br>Labour Leader</p>

<p><strong>Green light from Labour for cancer screening programme</strong></p>
<p>Labour Leader David Cunliffe has today committed to a national bowel screening programme, starting with extending the current service to the Southern and Waikato districts.</p>
<p>“Around 3000 New Zealanders develop bowel cancer each year and about 1200, or 100 a month, die from it.</p>
<p>“As Minister of Health in 2008 I pushed for the nationwide roll out of bowel cancer screening. Since then National has dragged the chain.</p>
<p>“It has said it will not make any decision on a national screening programme until the Waitemata pilot is completed and all monitoring and evaluation data has been analysed.</p>
<p>“But the results speak for themselves – more than 58,600 people completed a bowel screening test, more than 3200 went on to have a colonoscopy and cancer was detected in 129.</p>
<p>“If testing can prevent deaths there should be no prevaricating.</p>
<p>“Labour plans to begin the roll out next year, starting in Otago-Southland and the Waikato, areas which have a higher than proportionate bowel cancer death rate.</p>
<p>“Initially it will target those aged between 50 and 64, with a view to extending it to 74 in future in similar fashion to Labour’s breast screening campaign.</p>
<p>“The Waitemata programme will continue to screen 50 to 74 year olds.</p>
<p>“The cost across the three DHBs is $14 million a year from $2015/16.</p>
<p>“We will also set out an implementation plan to ensure the smooth roll out of the programme.</p>
<p>“Bowel cancer kills five times as many Kiwis each year than are killed on our roads. Screening results in at least a 15 per cent reduction in the death rate and can prevent 180 deaths a year.</p>
<p>“That’s why I am committed to getting this underway as soon as possible, and commencing a nationwide roll out within the first three years of a Labour Government,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
