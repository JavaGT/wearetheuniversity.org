<p>Charming but obscure Italian opera ‘Betly’ on stage</p>
<p>Voice performance students from the University of Waikato’s music programme will present a production of Donizetti’s opera comica Betly next Wednesday 9 April.</p>
<p>The one-act opera is a diverting love story and tells the tale of Betly, a flirtatious, winsome and strong-headed Swiss girl and Daniel, a young villager whom she is quite fond of but doesn’t reciprocate his ardent love for her.</p>
<p>Betly’s brother Max, who has been with the army for years steps in with a plan to unite the couple and get Betly to fall in love with Daniel.</p>
<p>Senior Lecturer in voice David Griffiths says that Betly is an utterly charming short opera with plenty of fine arias and ensembles to satisfy the discerning listener.</p>
<p>“The voice students have made a great effort to mount this production and it will be a most enjoyable evening&#39;s entertainment.”</p>
<p>Leading roles sit with versatile soprano Beverley Pullon (Betly) and young tenor Phillip ‘Akau (Daniel) and baritone Edward McKnight (Max), with our outstanding chorus of first and second year singers accompanied by Francis Cowan.</p>
<p>This is one of the first times Betly will have been performed and Beverley says that even though it is an obscure opera, like Donizetti’s best works, it contains an abundance of fresh melodic invention and graceful vocal writing.</p>
<p>“The opera is very comical and the recits will be sung in English so the audience can follow the story and enjoy the humour.”</p>
<p>Betly will be performed at the Dr John Gallagher Concert Chamber at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts at 7pm on Wednesday 9 April. Tickets are $5 on the door, or free for students with the relevant student ID.</p>
