<p>Upcoming Public Policy Lectures at Victoria University</p>
<p>Systems Change in the Manufacturing Sector: Innovation and Access to Technologies for Sustainable Development<br>Date: Friday, 11 April<br>Venue: The Treasury, 1 The Terrace, Level 5, Rooms 510-511<br>Time: 12:30pm - 1:30pm</p>
<p>Speaker: Dr Kira Matus, London School of Economics, Assistant Professor in Public Policy and Management</p>
<p>The sustainability of the industrial economic model of production and consumption is increasingly coming into question. This presentation will explore the development and dissemination of &#39;green technologies&#39; in the manufacturing sector, and how existing institutional arrangements, particularly those involving transnational actors, can be strengthened to improve the impact of innovation on sustainable development.</p>
<p>Dr Matus received her PhD in Public Policy from Harvard University in 2009 and is now the co-Director of the Harvard University Sustainability Science Program&#39;s &#39;Innovation and Access to Technologies for Sustainable Development project&#39; as well as Assistant Professor of Public Management at the London School of Economics.</p>
<p>Her research focuses on the application of innovative technology to address sustainable development. This includes exploring the potential of green chemistry as a so-called leapfrog technology, namely in the United States, India and China. She is also doing research on voluntary regulation, especially the role of standards and certification, in the development of green technologies. See here for more information on Dr Kira Matus.</p>
<p>We would like to acknowledge and thank The Treasury for their support in helping to make this public lecture possible. All welcome, RSVP&#39;s not required. Limited to 70 seats.<br>The Treasury Logo</p>
<p>A View From Paris: The 2015 Climate Agreement and Energy Sector Decarbonisation<br>Date: Tuesday, 15 April<br>Venue: Victoria University of Wellington, Pipitea Campus, Rutherford House, Ground Floor, Lecture Theatre Two (RHLT2)<br>Time: 12.30pm - 1.30pm</p>
<p>Speaker: Dr Christina Hood, Senior Climate Policy Analyst, International Energy Agency</p>
<p>A new international climate change agreement is currently being negotiated that will be applicable to all counties and have legal force. These negotiations are scheduled to conclude in December 2015 in Paris, France, which is also home to the International Energy Agency (IEA).</p>
<p>This presentation will draw on IEA analysis to present key technical and policy elements of the transition from today&#39;s fossil-fuel intensive to decarbonised energy systems: energy efficiency, carbon pricing, technology development, avoiding “lock-in” of high-emissions infrastructure and “unlocking” what has already been built. It will consider how the emerging structure of the new 2015 climate agreement could help (or hinder) implementation of these key elements, and some of the key questions for negotiators as they begin the drafting of the new agreement.</p>
<p>Dr Hood will also touch on the merits and demerits of oil and gas exploration and the plans for future exploration of fossil fuel resources within the &#39;transition&#39; period.</p>
<p>The IEA is an autonomous organisation which works to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for its 28 member countries and beyond. The IEA&#39;s four main areas of focus are: energy security, economic development, environmental awareness, and engagement worldwide.</p>
<p>All welcome, RSVP&#39;s not required. Limited to 150 seats</p>
<p>People, Productivity and High Performance<br>Date: Tuesday, 6 May<br>Venue: Intercontinental Hotel, 2 Grey Street, Lambton Rooms 1 &amp; 2<br>Time: 12.00pm - 12.30pm (light refreshments and networking) and 12.30pm - 1.45pm (presentation with Q&amp;A)</p>
<p>Keynote Speaker: Professor Deborah Blackman, Professor of Public Sector Management Strategy, University of NSW, Canberra and ANZSOG Visiting Scholar at Victoria University of Wellington.</p>
<p>As government budgets shrink and pressures on public services mount, the words &#39;performance&#39; and &#39;productivity&#39; are frequently heard. But do any of us find addressing problems of performance and productivity in our workplaces easy? And what do we mean by high performance at an individual, agency and whole of system level?</p>
<p>You are warmly invited to engage with two outstanding speakers from both sides of the Tasman to grapple with how we change the performance conversation, work out what our priorities are, and make the connection between motivation, management and a high performing state sector.</p>
<p>Professor Blackman&#39;s academic background is in human management and development as well as change management and organisational behaviour. A common theme of her work is managing knowledge to improve organisational effectiveness. She recently developed a new Performance Management Framework with the Australian Public Service Commission which focuses on achieving high performance in addition to extensively publishing in a range of international journals.</p>
<p>Moderator and second speaker: Jacki Couchman, Acting Chief Talent Officer, State Services Commission.</p>
<p>This event is jointly hosted by the Australia and New Zealand School of Government and the State Services Commission. There is no charge, but you do need to register for a ticket by Thursday, 1 May at the latest. The same lecture will be offered in Auckland on the 7th of May. See here for more information.</p>
<p>Globalization &amp; Sovereignty: How to Have Both?<br>Date: Thursday, 8 May<br>Venue: Victoria University of Wellington, Pipitea Campus, Government Buildings, Ground Floor, Lecture Theatre Three (GBLT3)<br>Time: 5.40pm-6.40pm</p>
<p>Speaker: Dr Inge Kaul, Associate Professor, Hertie School of Governance, Berlin, ANZSOG Visiting Scholar at Victoria University of Wellington</p>
<p>In this presentation, Dr Kaul will argue that effective public policy making today requires states to exercise &#39;smart sovereignty, i.e. sovereignty that combines the pursuit of national interests with respect for the policy making sovereignty of other nations and thus, fair and just international cooperation.</p>
<p>Dr Kaul is an advisor to various governmental, multilateral and not for profit organisations on policy options to meet global challenges. Inge&#39;s specialises in global public goods with much of her work looking at the international cooperation of financing public private partnerships, global governance, global issue diplomacy and the UN system reform.</p>
<p>Dr Kaul was the first director of UNDP&#39;s Human Development Report Office and later held the directorship of the UNDP&#39;s Office of Development Studies from 1995-2005. She is the author of numerous publications on international public economics &amp; finance and was the lead editor of the books Providing Global Public Goods: Managing Globalization and The New Public Finance: Responding to Global Challenges.</p>
<p>This lecture is co-hosted with the New Zealand Institute of International Affairs. Dr Inge Kaul&#39;s visit is made possible with thanks to The Australia and New Zealand School of Government Visiting Scholar Program at Victoria University of Wellington.

<p>Technocrats or Populists: Who Gained Influence During the Global Financial Crisis?<br>Date: Wednesday, 14 May<br>Venue: Victoria University of Wellington, Pipitea Campus, Government Buildings, GBLT4<br>Time: 12.30pm -1.30pm</p>
<p>Speaker: Professor Alasdair Roberts, Professor of Law &amp; Public Policy, Suffolk University, ANZSOG Visiting Scholar Program at Victoria University of Wellington</p>
<p>Before the crash of 2008, the liberalized global economy was regarded as a triumph of technocratic policy making. At first it seemed that the crash itself would undermine the credibility and influence of technocrats in central banks and other key institutions however events have not followed the path of earlier crises such as the Great Depression of the 1930&#39;s.</p>
<p>The global financial crisis has revealed the enduring power of technocrats and the limits of popular protest against the effects of neoliberal economic reforms.</p>
<p>Alasdair Roberts is the Jerome L. Rappaport Professor of Law and Public Policy at Suffolk University Law School, Boston, USA. He is the author of The Logic of Discipline: Global Capitalism and the Architecture of Government (Oxford University Press). Professor Roberts is a Fellow of the US National Academy of Public Administration and co-editor of the journal Governance.</p>
<p>All welcome, RSVP&#39;s not required. Limited to 85 seats. This lecture is made possible with thanks to the Australia and New Zealand School of Government Visiting Scholar Program at Victoria University of Wellington.  </p>
<p>Keeping Government Secrets in the Information Age<br>Date: Friday, 16 May<br>Venue: NZICA Conference Centre, Level 7, Tower Building, 50 Customhouse Quay<br>Time: 12.00pm - 12.30pm (light refreshments and networking) and 12.30pm - 1.45pm (presentation with Q&amp;A)</p>
<p>Speaker: Professor Alasdair Roberts, Professor of Law &amp; Public Policy, Suffolk University, ANZSOG Visiting Scholar at Victoria University of Wellington</p>
<p>Has the digital revolution made it easier or harder for governments to keep secrets? The controversies over WikiLeaks and the Snowden disclosures might make us think we live in a new age of transparency. The reality is more complicated. In many ways, technological change has actually complicated the task of monitoring government. We should not underestimate the capacity of governments to react forcefully against transparency initiatives that threaten vital state interests.</p>
<p>Alasdair Roberts is the Jerome L. Rappaport Professor of Law and Public Policy at Suffolk University Law School, Boston, USA. He is the author of Blacked Out: Government Secrecy in the Information Age (Cambridge University Press). Professor Roberts is a Fellow of the US National Academy of Public Administration and co-editor of the journal Governance.</p>

<p>State Sector Reform<br>Date: Friday, 20 June<br>Venue: Wellington Cathedral of St Paul, Fishes and Loaves Hall, Corner of Molesworth and Hill Streets, Wellington<br>Time: 12.30pm - 1.30pm</p>
<p>Speaker: Mr Iain Rennie, State Services Commissioner, State Services Commission</p>
<p>The role of the State Services Commissioner is to provide leadership and over-sight of the State services including:</p>
<p>a) Promoting the spirit of service to the community;<br>b) Promoting the spirit of collaboration among agencies;<br>c) Identifying and developing high-calibre leaders;<br>d) Working with State services leaders to ensure that the State services maintains high standards of integrity and conduct and are led well and are trusted;<br>e) Overseeing workforce and personnel matters in the State Sector;<br>f) Advising on the design and capability of the State Services;<br>g) Evaluating the performance of Public Service Leaders;<br>h) Supporting the efficient, effective and economical achievement of good outcomes by the State services; and<br>i) Promoting a culture of stewardship in the State services.</p>
<p>Over the last few years there has been a lot of diagnosis around the state of the public services. The diagnosis and debate is now over and it is time for the hard graft of implementation and change. The changes are about partnering opportunities with individual sectors, groups and unions; essentially a set of permissions for people to do things in different ways.</p>
<p>New Zealand has a strong tradition of ground breaking reform in public management and these reforms continue the push to be at the leading edge of innovation and excellence in State services.</p>
<p>All welcome, RSVP&#39;s not required. Limited to 100 seats. More details to follow in the next update.</p>
<p>Coalition Government: Reflections on the United Kingdom<br>Date: Tuesday, 1 July<br>Venue: Victoria University of Wellington, Pipitea Campus, Railway Station, Level One, Room RWW129 (Turn right when you come out the lifts or stairs, then right again)<br>Time: 12.30pm - 1.30pm</p>
<p>Speaker: Lord Griffiths of Burry Port</p>
<p>The UK General Election of May 2010 resulted in a hung parliament and, following negotiations between the Conservative Party (which secured the most seats but no overall majority) and the Liberal Democrats, the country&#39;s first coalition government since Churchill&#39;s War Ministry emerged. The &#39;first-past-the-post&#39; electoral system which still operates in the UK means that, unlike in New Zealand, coalition government is a rarity rather than the norm.<br>Few would suggest that the Conservatives and Lib Dems are natural bed-fellows, and their alliance took many observers by surprise. Yet, despite many tensions, and much vilification by its opponents, their administration remains intact four years later. Indeed, the Coalition now looks likely to hold together until the next General Election in May 2015, albeit that each party seems to be making strenuous efforts to separate out from government proposals the particular benefits due to them. It is clear that both are anxious to impress upon the public well-focused and separate profiles ahead of moving into campaigning mode - and that the next year is going to be a long one!</p>
<p>As a member of the UK&#39;s second chamber, the House of Lords, Lord Griffiths has been privileged to observe the coalition from close-up. In this lecture he gives his candid impression - as a member of the opposition Labour Party - of its working, achievements and weaknesses. He also assesses whether coalition government has been &#39;good&#39; for the UK and the likelihood of it becoming more common in the future.</p>
<p>All welcome, RSVP&#39;s not required. Limited to 37 seats due to the venue.</p>
<p>Leslie Griffiths, the Rev&#39;d the Lord Griffiths of Burry Port, has been a member of the House of Lords since 2004. He sits on the Labour benches and speaks on education, international affairs and a range of social and ethical issues. He was the President of the Methodist Conference in 1994-5 and an influential church leader in the two decades since. He helped to get the Christian Socialist Movement affiliated to the Labour Party and has twice given the prestigious Tawney lecture - in 1995 on &#39;The Survival of Hope&#39; and in 2002 on &#39;Multiculturalism&#39;. A prolific author, popular speaker and respected broadcaster, he has been senior minister of Wesley&#39;s Chapel at the heart of London since 1996. He is President of the Boy&#39;s Brigade and a Canon of St Paul&#39;s Cathedral.</p>

<p>The Challenge for Social Democracy: A Public Conversation<br>Date: Wednesday, 9 July<br>Venue: Victoria University of Wellington, Pipitea Campus, Rutherford House, Ground Floor, Lecture Theatre One (RHLT1)<br>Time: 5.30pm - 6.30pm</p>
<p>Speakers: Anna Yeatman, Professorial Fellow, Whitlam Institute, University of Western Sydney and Eric Sidoti, Director, Whitlam Institute, University of Western Sydney</p>
<p>In the past, Australia and New Zealand shared a robust and vital political tradition of what we might call a liberal republican version of social democracy - a vision of each of these states as a sovereign political association that is the embodiment of a public capacity to respond effectively to collective challenges. A vision that provides the conditions for equal and effective citizenship.</p>
<p>This talk will focus on why it is that this tradition has faltered and how it might be recovered. The argument will be that it is not so much the principles of social democracy that we need to invoke; rather we need to rediscover the argument for these principles in a way that responds to the terms of the present. All welcome, RSVP&#39;s not required. Limited to 300 seats.</p>
<p>Anna is political philosopher and author of many publications, the most recent of which is Feminism in the Technological Age (Australian Feminist Studies, 2014) and co-authored The Aporia of Rights: Explorations in citizenship in the era of human rights (Bloomsbury, forthcoming 2014).</p>
<p>Eric has been the Institute&#39;s Director since 2007. He has been actively engaged in public policy development and advocacy throughout his working life. This has included appointments as the Executive Director of the Human Rights Council of Australia, various roles for Amnesty International in Australia and as National Secretary of the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace.<br>The Whitlam Institute was established at the University of Western Sydney in 2000 as a research and education base that reflects the significance of progressive public policy initiatives Whitlam Institute logo</p>
<p>Other Items of Interest:<br>Renewable Energy Futures: Challenges for Law and Business<br>Date: Tuesday, 8 April<br>Venue: Victoria University of Wellington, Pipitea Campus, Old Government Buildings, Ground Floor, Lecture Theatre Three (GBLT3)<br>Time: 12:30pm - 1:30pm</p>
<p>Speaker: Dr Eric Martinot, Senior Research Director, Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies, Tokyo and Adjunct Teaching Associate, Victoria University of Wellington</p>
<p>Driven by a growing number of policies in over 120 countries around the world over the past 20 years, renewable energy has become mainstreamed. Over $250 billion was invested in renewable energy last year, about the same as global investment in conventional power generation. Wind power in China already produced as much electricity as nuclear. Scenarios and country policy targets show much higher shares of renewables worldwide in the future. A turning point is being reached and a new generation of regulatory frameworks and business models will need to evolve. This includes, for example, power market rules for distributed and peer-to-peer solar, contracts for power-demand flexibility, building materials standards and codes, and electric vehicle charging policies. Opportunities</p>
<p>Dr Eric Martinot is an internationally recognised writer, scholar and speaker on the subject of renewable energy. He has authored 70 publications on sustainable energy over the past 25 years. He was formerly a senior energy specialist with the World Bank, and holds a PhD in Energy and Resources from the University of California, Berkeley and a BS in Electrical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<p>Keeping Government Secrets in the Information Age<br>Date: Friday, 16 May<br>Venue: NZICA Conference Centre, Level 7, Tower Building, 50 Customhouse Quay<br>Time: 12.00pm - 12.30pm (light refreshments and networking) and 12.30pm - 1.45pm (presentation with Q&amp;A)</p>
<p>Speaker: Professor Alasdair Roberts, Professor of Law &amp; Public Policy, Suffolk University, ANZSOG Visiting Scholar at Victoria University of Wellington</p>
<p>Has the digital revolution made it easier or harder for governments to keep secrets? The controversies over WikiLeaks and the Snowden disclosures might make us think we live in a new age of transparency. The reality is more complicated. In many ways, technological change has actually complicated the task of monitoring government. We should not underestimate the capacity of governments to react forcefully against transparency initiatives that threaten vital state interests.</p>

<p>State Sector Reform<br>Date: Friday, 20 June<br>Venue: Wellington Cathedral of St Paul, Fishes and Loaves Hall, Corner of Molesworth and Hill Streets, Wellington<br>Time: 12.30pm - 1.30pm</p>
<p>Speaker: Mr Iain Rennie, State Services Commissioner, State Services Commission</p>
<p>The role of the State Services Commissioner is to provide leadership and over-sight of the State services including:</p>
<p>a) Promoting the spirit of service to the community;<br>b) Promoting the spirit of collaboration among agencies;<br>c) Identifying and developing high-calibre leaders;<br>d) Working with State services leaders to ensure that the State services maintains high standards of integrity and conduct and are led well and are trusted;<br>e) Overseeing workforce and personnel matters in the State Sector;<br>f) Advising on the design and capability of the State Services;<br>g) Evaluating the performance of Public Service Leaders;<br>h) Supporting the efficient, effective and economical achievement of good outcomes by the State services; and<br>i) Promoting a culture of stewardship in the State services.</p>
<p>Over the last few years there has been a lot of diagnosis around the state of the public services. The diagnosis and debate is now over and it is time for the hard graft of implementation and change. The changes are about partnering opportunities with individual sectors, groups and unions; essentially a set of permissions for people to do things in different ways.</p>
<p>New Zealand has a strong tradition of ground breaking reform in public management and these reforms continue the push to be at the leading edge of innovation and excellence in State services.</p>
<p>All welcome, RSVP&#39;s not required. Limited to 100 seats. More details to follow in the next update.</p>
<p>Coalition Government: Reflections on the United Kingdom<br>Date: Tuesday, 1 July<br>Venue: Victoria University of Wellington, Pipitea Campus, Railway Station, Level One, Room RWW129 (Turn right when you come out the lifts or stairs, then right again)<br>Time: 12.30pm - 1.30pm</p>
<p>Speaker: Lord Griffiths of Burry Port</p>
<p>The UK General Election of May 2010 resulted in a hung parliament and, following negotiations between the Conservative Party (which secured the most seats but no overall majority) and the Liberal Democrats, the country&#39;s first coalition government since Churchill&#39;s War Ministry emerged. The &#39;first-past-the-post&#39; electoral system which still operates in the UK means that, unlike in New Zealand, coalition government is a rarity rather than the norm.<br>Few would suggest that the Conservatives and Lib Dems are natural bed-fellows, and their alliance took many observers by surprise. Yet, despite many tensions, and much vilification by its opponents, their administration remains intact four years later. Indeed, the Coalition now looks likely to hold together until the next General Election in May 2015, albeit that each party seems to be making strenuous efforts to separate out from government proposals the particular benefits due to them. It is clear that both are anxious to impress upon the public well-focused and separate profiles ahead of moving into campaigning mode - and that the next year is going to be a long one!</p>
<p>As a member of the UK&#39;s second chamber, the House of Lords, Lord Griffiths has been privileged to observe the coalition from close-up. In this lecture he gives his candid impression - as a member of the opposition Labour Party - of its working, achievements and weaknesses. He also assesses whether coalition government has been &#39;good&#39; for the UK and the likelihood of it becoming more common in the future.</p>
<p>All welcome, RSVP&#39;s not required. Limited to 37 seats due to the venue.</p>

<p>The Challenge for Social Democracy: A Public Conversation<br>Date: Wednesday, 9 July<br>Venue: Victoria University of Wellington, Pipitea Campus, Rutherford House, Ground Floor, Lecture Theatre One (RHLT1)<br>Time: 5.30pm - 6.30pm</p>
<p>Speakers: Anna Yeatman, Professorial Fellow, Whitlam Institute, University of Western Sydney and Eric Sidoti, Director, Whitlam Institute, University of Western Sydney</p>
<p>In the past, Australia and New Zealand shared a robust and vital political tradition of what we might call a liberal republican version of social democracy - a vision of each of these states as a sovereign political association that is the embodiment of a public capacity to respond effectively to collective challenges. A vision that provides the conditions for equal and effective citizenship.</p>
<p>This talk will focus on why it is that this tradition has faltered and how it might be recovered. The argument will be that it is not so much the principles of social democracy that we need to invoke; rather we need to rediscover the argument for these principles in a way that responds to the terms of the present. All welcome, RSVP&#39;s not required. Limited to 300 seats.</p>
<p>Anna is political philosopher and author of many publications, the most recent of which is Feminism in the Technological Age (Australian Feminist Studies, 2014) and co-authored The Aporia of Rights: Explorations in citizenship in the era of human rights (Bloomsbury, forthcoming 2014).</p>
<p>Eric has been the Institute&#39;s Director since 2007. He has been actively engaged in public policy development and advocacy throughout his working life. This has included appointments as the Executive Director of the Human Rights Council of Australia, various roles for Amnesty International in Australia and as National Secretary of the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace.<br>The Whitlam Institute was established at the University of Western Sydney in 2000 as a research and education base that reflects the significance of progressive public policy initiatives Whitlam Institute logo</p>
<p>Other Items of Interest:<br>Renewable Energy Futures: Challenges for Law and Business<br>Date: Tuesday, 8 April<br>Venue: Victoria University of Wellington, Pipitea Campus, Old Government Buildings, Ground Floor, Lecture Theatre Three (GBLT3)<br>Time: 12:30pm - 1:30pm</p>
<p>Speaker: Dr Eric Martinot, Senior Research Director, Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies, Tokyo and Adjunct Teaching Associate, Victoria University of Wellington</p>
<p>Driven by a growing number of policies in over 120 countries around the world over the past 20 years, renewable energy has become mainstreamed. Over $250 billion was invested in renewable energy last year, about the same as global investment in conventional power generation. Wind power in China already produced as much electricity as nuclear. Scenarios and country policy targets show much higher shares of renewables worldwide in the future. A turning point is being reached and a new generation of regulatory frameworks and business models will need to evolve. This includes, for example, power market rules for distributed and peer-to-peer solar, contracts for power-demand flexibility, building materials standards and codes, and electric vehicle charging policies. Opportunities and challenges for law and practice in New Zealand will be explored</p>
<p>Dr Eric Martinot is an internationally recognised writer, scholar and speaker on the subject of renewable energy. He has authored 70 publications on sustainable energy over the past 25 years. He was formerly a senior energy specialist with the World Bank, and holds a PhD in Energy and Resources from the University of California, Berkeley and a BS in Electrical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<p>Rutherford House, Bunny Street Entrance Map of Pipitea CampusSystems Change in the Manufacturing Sector: Innovation and Access to Technologies for Sustainable Development<br>Date: Friday, 11 April<br>Venue: The Treasury, 1 The Terrace, Level 5, Rooms 510-511<br>Time: 12:30pm - 1:30pm</p>
<p>Speaker: Dr Kira Matus, London School of Economics, Assistant Professor in Public Policy and Management</p>
<p>The sustainability of the industrial economic model of production and consumption is increasingly coming into question. This presentation will explore the development and dissemination of &#39;green technologies&#39; in the manufacturing sector, and how existing institutional arrangements, particularly those involving transnational actors, can be strengthened to improve the impact of innovation on sustainable development.</p>
<p>Dr Matus received her PhD in Public Policy from Harvard University in 2009 and is now the co-Director of the Harvard University Sustainability Science Program&#39;s &#39;Innovation and Access to Technologies for Sustainable Development project&#39; as well as Assistant Professor of Public Management at the London School of Economics.</p>
<p>Her research focuses on the application of innovative technology to address sustainable development. This includes exploring the potential of green chemistry as a so-called leapfrog technology, namely in the United States, India and China. She is also doing research on voluntary regulation, especially the role of standards and certification, in the development of green technologies. See here for more information on Dr Kira Matus.</p>

<p>A View From Paris: The 2015 Climate Agreement and Energy Sector Decarbonisation<br>Date: Tuesday, 15 April<br>Venue: Victoria University of Wellington, Pipitea Campus, Rutherford House, Ground Floor, Lecture Theatre Two (RHLT2)<br>Time: 12.30pm - 1.30pm</p>
<p>Speaker: Dr Christina Hood, Senior Climate Policy Analyst, International Energy Agency</p>
<p>A new international climate change agreement is currently being negotiated that will be applicable to all counties and have legal force. These negotiations are scheduled to conclude in December 2015 in Paris, France, which is also home to the International Energy Agency (IEA).</p>
<p>This presentation will draw on IEA analysis to present key technical and policy elements of the transition from today&#39;s fossil-fuel intensive to decarbonised energy systems: energy efficiency, carbon pricing, technology development, avoiding “lock-in” of high-emissions infrastructure and “unlocking” what has already been built. It will consider how the emerging structure of the new 2015 climate agreement could help (or hinder) implementation of these key elements, and some of the key questions for negotiators as they begin the drafting of the new agreement.</p>
<p>Dr Hood will also touch on the merits and demerits of oil and gas exploration and the plans for future exploration of fossil fuel resources within the &#39;transition&#39; period.</p>
<p>The IEA is an autonomous organisation which works to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for its 28 member countries and beyond. The IEA&#39;s four main areas of focus are: energy security, economic development, environmental awareness, and engagement worldwide.</p>

<p>People, Productivity and High Performance<br>Date: Tuesday, 6 May<br>Venue: Intercontinental Hotel, 2 Grey Street, Lambton Rooms 1 &amp; 2<br>Time: 12.00pm - 12.30pm (light refreshments and networking) and 12.30pm - 1.45pm (presentation with Q&amp;A)</p>
<p>Keynote Speaker: Professor Deborah Blackman, Professor of Public Sector Management Strategy, University of NSW, Canberra and ANZSOG Visiting Scholar at Victoria University of Wellington.</p>
<p>As government budgets shrink and pressures on public services mount, the words &#39;performance&#39; and &#39;productivity&#39; are frequently heard. But do any of us find addressing problems of performance and productivity in our workplaces easy? And what do we mean by high performance at an individual, agency and whole of system level?</p>
<p>You are warmly invited to engage with two outstanding speakers from both sides of the Tasman to grapple with how we change the performance conversation, work out what our priorities are, and make the connection between motivation, management and a high performing state sector.</p>
<p>Professor Blackman&#39;s academic background is in human management and development as well as change management and organisational behaviour. A common theme of her work is managing knowledge to improve organisational effectiveness. She recently developed a new Performance Management Framework with the Australian Public Service Commission which focuses on achieving high performance in addition to extensively publishing in a range of international journals.</p>
<p>Moderator and second speaker: Jacki Couchman, Acting Chief Talent Officer, State Services Commission.</p>
<p>This event is jointly hosted by the Australia and New Zealand School of Government and the State Services Commission.

<p>Globalization &amp; Sovereignty: How to Have Both?<br>Date: Thursday, 8 May<br>Venue: Victoria University of Wellington, Pipitea Campus, Government Buildings, Ground Floor, Lecture Theatre Three (GBLT3)<br>Time: 5.40pm-6.40pm</p>
<p>Speaker: Dr Inge Kaul, Associate Professor, Hertie School of Governance, Berlin, ANZSOG Visiting Scholar at Victoria University of Wellington</p>
<p>In this presentation, Dr Kaul will argue that effective public policy making today requires states to exercise &#39;smart sovereignty, i.e. sovereignty that combines the pursuit of national interests with respect for the policy making sovereignty of other nations and thus, fair and just international cooperation.</p>
<p>Dr Kaul is an advisor to various governmental, multilateral and not for profit organisations on policy options to meet global challenges. Inge&#39;s specialises in global public goods with much of her work looking at the international cooperation of financing public private partnerships, global governance, global issue diplomacy and the UN system reform.</p>
<p>Dr Kaul was the first director of UNDP&#39;s Human Development Report Office and later held the directorship of the UNDP&#39;s Office of Development Studies from 1995-2005. She is the author of numerous publications on international public economics &amp; finance and was the lead editor of the books Providing Global Public Goods: Managing Globalization and The New Public Finance: Responding to Global Challenges.</p>

<p>Technocrats or Populists: Who Gained Influence During the Global Financial Crisis?<br>Date: Wednesday, 14 May<br>Venue: Victoria University of Wellington, Pipitea Campus, Government Buildings, GBLT4<br>Time: 12.30pm -1.30pm</p>
<p>Speaker: Professor Alasdair Roberts, Professor of Law &amp; Public Policy, Suffolk University, ANZSOG Visiting Scholar Program at Victoria University of Wellington</p>
<p>Before the crash of 2008, the liberalized global economy was regarded as a triumph of technocratic policy making. At first it seemed that the crash itself would undermine the credibility and influence of technocrats in central banks and other key institutions however events have not followed the path of earlier crises such as the Great Depression of the 1930&#39;s.</p>
<p>The global financial crisis has revealed the enduring power of technocrats and the limits of popular protest against the effects of neoliberal economic reforms.</p>
