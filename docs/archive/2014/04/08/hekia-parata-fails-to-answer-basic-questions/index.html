<p><strong>Hekia Parata fails to answer basic questions</strong></p>
<p>Education Minister Hekia Parata’s inability to answer even the most basic questions about her proposed new Executive Principal roles will have alarm bells ringing in school communities all around the country, Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>“Schools are already concerned if they have a great principal they could find them taken away from their school for two days a week.</p>
<p>“Hekia Parata’s failure to answer simple questions about what evidence underpinned this proposal will only increase their level of concern.</p>
<p>“Every good school principal will say it’s more than a fulltime job. How are these new ‘super principals’ supposed to continue successfully leading their own school and take on the challenge of ensuring student success at up to 10 other schools as well?</p>
<p>“Hekia Parata also couldn’t answer basic questions about the accountability mechanisms around the new roles and whether Boards of Trustees will have the final say over whether or not their school comes under the purview of one of these new super principals.</p>
<p>“School communities are all very different. Many in these communities fear they will have these new super principals imposed on them with little consultation – something they have come to expect from Hekia Parata and the current National government.</p>
<p>“I’m not at all surprised increasing numbers of parents, teachers and principals are raising concerns,” Chris Hipkins says.</p>
