<p>Student Cat Clinic Returns</p>
<p>Furry flatmates are well known in the world of Scarfies, but it’s flatmates of the feline variety that are set to get the treatment at the second annual OUSA and Otago Polytechnic Cat Clinic this Friday.</p>
<p>“The OUSA Cat Clinic is about making sure that the cats that might usually not get regular treatment have the basic check-ups and treatments they need.” Said Nali Lee, OUSA Welfare Officer. “There’s no doubt that pets are a big part of helping students relax in the stressful times, and this service means that those students can give a little love back at a cost they can afford.”</p>
<p>The clinic is a continuation from last year’s cat day which saw the Otago Polytechnic’s veterinary clinic check, deworm, vaccinate and microchip 60 cats in one day. The day is heavily supported by the Otago Polytechnic, SPCA, Virbac, Stockguard, and local veterinarians and nurses also come on board to donate their time.</p>
<p>“It’s a busy day, but we have a lot of help thanks to the kindness of the local community with vets and nurses from as far away as Mosgiel giving up time to help out.” Said Ms. Lee.</p>
<p>Stray cats have been an issue in Dunedin for a number of years, and the cat clinic has two approaches aimed at reducing the number of strays in the north end. Firstly the students’ association is pushing for more responsible ownership of pets by ensuring pets are registered and linked with a veterinarian in Dunedin, and secondly the clinic is offering discounted de-sexing at a later date.</p>
<p>“We realise the impact of strays in the North end and we’re hoping that by offering cheap desexing options we can continue to make more students take the step into responsible pet ownership.” Said Ms. Lee.</p>
