<p>**Press release: ACT New Zealand<br>**</p>
<p>Easter trading laws are outdated and in need of a major overhaul, said ACT leader Jamie Whyte today.</p>
<p>&quot;This weekend thousands of businesses will be closed, liquor sales will be banned, and countless Kiwis will be denied the right to work,&quot; said Mr Whyte.</p>
<p>&quot;Retailers are fed up. Consumers are fed up. Yet this nanny-statism continues, without any clear justification.</p>
<p>&quot;Laws that dictate when businesses can and cannot operate are a relic of Muldoonism. In the year 2014, the right to work and trade year-round should be a given.</p>
<p>&quot;Religious reasons for shutting down the country and banning liquor sales are no longer relevant to New Zealand&#39;s increasingly diverse society. No one who chooses to refrain from working or shopping is forced to do so.</p>
<p>&quot;Some businesses will ignore the law and open anyway - the state has never enforced these overcomplicated laws consistently. Other businesses who could open legally will close down, unable to afford inflated labour costs.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumers will find themselves in a time-warp, a return to the days of government paternalism.</p>
<p>&quot;If the government insists on robbing the economy of two days of productivity, there ought to be a good reason.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s time for a national conversation about our archaic Easter trading laws. ACT will be pushing for an overhaul.&quot;  </p>
