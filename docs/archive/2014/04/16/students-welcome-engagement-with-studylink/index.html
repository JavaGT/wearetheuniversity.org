<p>Students Welcome Engagement with StudyLink - Shows in Better Performance</p>
<p>16 April 2014</p>
<p>The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) has welcomed the improved performance from StudyLink in 2014. There is no doubt that getting their loans and allowances processed on time makes it easier for students to concentrate on being students.</p>
<p>“We are appreciative of how well StudyLink have listened to us. They have been responsive and adapted their practices in response to the feedback from students we have been able to provide,” said Daniel Haines, President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.</p>
<p>“In 2013 students faced significant problems and delays. Since then we have worked extremely closely with StudyLink. To their absolute credit, they have heard and heeded the student voice,” said Haines.</p>
<p>“We recommended setting a date to give students some certainty, we promoted the date to students, we recommended improvements to practices, including to systems, and everything that StudyLink could could manage within their resources was implemented.</p>
<p>“We realise that we could have been on the outside throwing stones and complaining, but students’ interests are better served by our getting involved and helping to make positive change. It is a credit to the Minister, Chester Borrows and Susan Kosmala and her team at StudyLink that they have been open to our approaches. It’s not the case with all agencies or Ministers.</p>
<p>“We, and StudyLink, are aware that there’s still work to do, and that implementing some of our suggestions are still works-in-progress. We are continuing to work closely alongside StudyLink, while they keep listening we know that we will continue to see improvements.”</p>
