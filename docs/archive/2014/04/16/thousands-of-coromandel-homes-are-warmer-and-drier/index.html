<p><strong>Wednesday, 16 April 2014, 11:26 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Thousands of Coromandel homes are warmer and drier</p>
<p>Scott Simpson MP is thrilled that thousands of people in the Coromandel are living in warmer, healthier homes now they’ve had insulation installed as part of two Government programmes.</p>
<p>“The insulation programmes Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart and Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes are helping to reduce health risks for many households in the Coromandel electorate,” Mr Simpson says.</p>
<p>“Warmer, drier homes are better for people’s health. And healthy people don’t end up spending time and money going to the doctor or taking days off sick.”</p>
<p>The 2013 Budget allocated $100 million over three years to Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes. The programme offers free ceiling and underfloor heating to 46,000 low-income households, particularly families with children and high health needs.</p>
<p>Scott Simpson MP says he would like to thank organisations in the Coromandel for their continuing support of the programme.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Who is eligible for Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes?</p>
<p>• The home owner or main tenant needs to have a Community Services Card and there must be children under 17 years, adults over 65 years or someone with high health needs living in your home.</p>
<p>• Landlords with eligible tenants will also qualify, although landlords may be asked to make a small contribution.</p>
<p>• You must live in a house built before the year 2000.</p>
<p>How do I apply for free insulation as part of the programme?</p>
<p>• You can find a list of insulation providers contracted to deliver the programme at <a href="http://www.energywise.govt.nz">www.energywise.govt.nz</a></p>
<p>• If you are a tenant, the insulation provider will help liaise with your<br>landlord.</p>
