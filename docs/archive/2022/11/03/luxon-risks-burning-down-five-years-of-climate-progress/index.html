<p>Chris Luxon’s plan to reopen new gas projects in the middle of the climate crisis is about as irresponsible as it gets.</p>
<p>Speaking on a visit to Taranaki, Mr. Luxon confirmed that a National Government would be committed to gas for “several decades.”</p>
<p>“Luxon is playing politics with our kids&#39; futures. New Zealanders and the planet deserve better,” says the Green Party’s spokesperson for energy and resources, Julie Anne Genter.</p>
<p>“The clock is ticking and people want faster, more radical action on climate change. They want their communities powered by clean renewable energy; warm, healthy homes; and the creation of thousands of new planet-saving jobs.</p>
<p>“To achieve this - and keep the climate healthy for future generations - we have to keep fossil fuels where they belong: in the ground. And yet, in the middle of a climate crisis, and at the very moment we need to accelerate efforts to cut climate pollution, Mr. Luxon announces a plan to put the gas burners on global warming.</p>
<p>It is hard to overstate how irresponsible this is. And for what? A few extra votes.</p>
<p>“Only last week, the historically conservative International Energy Agency made clear that relying on fossil gas as a transition fuel is not an option. To keep global warming to within 1.5 degrees, the report said, countries need to phase out fossil fuels.</p>
<p>“For years, fossil fuel companies denied the existence of the climate crisis. When that was no longer an option, the industry turned to promoting the myth that gas is a suitable transition fuel that will eventually lead to clean energy.</p>

<p>“It looks like the National Party’s climate policy - from Judith Collins to Chris Luxon - is on the same trajectory.</p>
<p>“Fossil fuels can have no place in our transition to a zero carbon future. Not only that but workers deserve certainty about a just transition.</p>
<p>“In Government, the Greens have taken more action to protect the climate than the last three decades of governments combined. But the pace of change is still too slow.</p>
<p>“In a strong position to shape the direction of the next Government, the Green Party will eliminate fossil fuels from our energy systems and lead a just transition to clean, renewable energy,” says Julie Anne Genter.</p>
