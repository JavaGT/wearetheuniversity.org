<p><strong>Friday, 11 February 2022, 10:27 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“MBIE advised the Government to go slower in raising the minimum wage and estimates thousands fewer jobs will be created as a result of its hike”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=cS9TqS4Q_p-ntHw6Br358S9yaYEmhrVXSntSf0iqfzh3B_Qxr0FrHAicTo6lPPHvYDB4YQZW3MUjuHcDg-DiN8smVUWrnEkQl3na4irn4Ds&e=752ed10e9ed7db3a7867d6b86ebadc6c&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=6_400_jobs_lost_min_wage&n=2">MBIE estimated that raising the minimum wage to $21.25 an hour, 5 cents more than Labour chose, would restrain employment growth by 6,400 jobs</a>.</p>
<p>“This move will mean businesses raise their prices or close, and more people are out of work and on welfare for longer. We just can’t afford that.</p>
<p>“Michael Wood argues the minimum wage increase will have a ‘stimulatory’ effect on the economy. Both MBIE and Treasury have repeatedly told the Government this is unlikely to happen:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=x7qo17qR1Kb0lLg85yQYfAbXTC6Z7wxyptuSZemzKnHW6MvSFOrjcviA_qc0F8nqNAG3LOUiayT8EBPO8PK_Su7xcEsrPaJMsEBiOmqN43GuNuahuHSmoa3CjExCg-e6tuajWEFTgYbaoJ4y55HAJilNopTOQ6to7vs6aTvdeXJJWpTVWt2XXw7uh4RLudN9&e=752ed10e9ed7db3a7867d6b86ebadc6c&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=6_400_jobs_lost_min_wage&n=3"><em>‘There is also an argument that lifting the minimum wage can result in increased overall consumer demand caused by minimum wage earners spending the additional money as they normally spend a high proportion, if not all, of their earnings. For this to happen, the increase in overall spending would need to be significant. As only a small number of people earn at or near the minimum wage (estimated to be 175.500 people or 9.2 per cent of all wage earners in the 2020 Minimum Wage Report), <strong>this effect is unlikely to occur in New Zealand</strong>.’</em></a></p>

<p>“Here’s the reality: Labour is raising the minimum wage by 6 per cent because inflation is running at 6 per cent.</p>
<p>“The Reserve Bank has printed – and Labour has borrowed and spent – tens of billions of dollars in the past two years. That money is moving around the economy and pushing up the price of everything.</p>
<p>“Border restrictions and Red traffic light restrictions mean less is being produced and business costs are higher. New rules and new taxes push up prices as well.</p>
<p>“Prices have gone up 5.9 per cent. Wages have gone up just 2.6 per cent. Kiwis can buy less with their money – they’re getting poorer.</p>
<p>“Inflation is at a 31-year high and Kiwis are being squeezed from every direction – at the checkout, at the petrol pump, and when they pay the rent.</p>
<p>“The only adequate response is a return to rational economics.”</p>
<p>ACT would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get borrowing and wasteful spending under control</li>
<li>Change the Reserve Bank legislation back to focusing on inflation only</li>
<li>Provide tax relief, cutting the 30 per cent tax rate to 17.5 per cent, giving the average worker an extra $2,000</li>
<li>Stop hitting businesses and productive people with new rules and taxes</li>
<li>Immediately allow all vaccinated, negative tested travellers into the country – New Zealanders, workers, students and tourists.</li>
</ul>
