Hybrid Working</h1>
<p><strong>Monday, 21 February 2022, 10:31 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology">Auckland University of Technology</a></strong></p>
<p>Once upon a time, in what feels like a lifetime ago, most workers spent their days commuting to and from an office or workplace outside the home.</p>
<p>Then the pandemic struck. More than two years on, many Kiwis now do their jobs in a combination of work from home (WFH) and work from office (WFO).</p>
<p>Covid has ushered in the era of hybrid working.</p>
<p>The benefits of hybrid working seem obvious – fewer long and expensive commutes, more time with family, and a chance to work across hours that suit the individual (with the boss’s OK).</p>
<p>But some recent overseas studies have highlighted the detrimental effects of hybrid working – including employees feeling isolated from their colleagues and a potential drop in productivity.</p>
<p>However, new findings from the AUT Wellbeing@Work study paint a much brighter picture when it comes to blending WFH and WFO.</p>
<p>The iterative study, led by AUT Business School Professor Jarrod Haar (Ngāti Maniapoto, Ngāti Mahuta), has been tracking the New Zealand workforce since February 2020.</p>
<p>Data from November 2021 show that:</p>
<p>Over one third (39%) of Kiwi workers are in the office full-time.</p>
<p>Just under 15% are full-time WFH (five days a week)</p>
<p>The rest (48%) are hybrid working, with most working 50-50 office/home.</p>
<p>This represents a huge growth in WFH, with most of the workforce no longer in the office full-time.</p>

<p>The research shows that hybrid working is no different than other forms of work (e.g., solely office or solely WFH), with no difference in employees’ work-life balance, levels of job stress, job performance, or levels of engagement at work.</p>
<p>The study also shows that hybrid workers are the happiest employees. They are also the most innovative.</p>
<p>In contrast, full-time office-based workers score the lowest in terms of innovation (solely remote workers land in the middle).</p>
<p>The study also sounds a note of caution for those only working remotely, finding that solely WFH is linked with the highest levels of work demands, loneliness, and turnover intentions (thinking about getting a new job).</p>
<p>Professor Haar says the evidence shows the hybrid workforce is the new normal – and that is to be welcomed.</p>
<p>“Hybrid workers clearly benefit from higher levels of trust from their managers and respond well to the independence and flexibility of hybrid working,” says Professor Haar, winner of the just-announced AUT University Medal, the top award for academics.</p>
<p>“However, employees working solely from home might suffer from a lack of clear-cut boundaries, as well as isolation and loneliness.”</p>
<p>The solution?</p>
<p>“Find a way to work from home and in the office,” says Professor Haar. “Your boss and your whānau will thank you for it.”</p>
