<p><strong>Thursday, 17 February 2022, 11:47 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>“The government’s Covid modelling being used to enforce restrictions on kiwis must be released in its entirety for public scrutiny,” says Winston Peters Leader of New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“How can the government ask us to ‘trust the science’ if we aren’t shown what the science is that is being used?”</p>
<p>“Transparency is even more important now given the phenomenally inaccurate nature of some of the recent models that had us threatened with fifty thousand cases by Waitangi Day.”</p>
<p>“The Covid Response Minister Chris Hipkins himself has said that he has ‘always been sceptical’ about the modelling and compared them to weather forecasts.”</p>
<p>“It’s astounding that the public should continue to be asked to believe the numbers without being able to see and analyse any assumptions, background science, criteria, or data being used.”</p>
<p>“The government has an obligation to release the entirety of this data they are using to enforce restrictions that are effecting so many kiwis’ lives.”</p>
<p>“We should not be continually subjected to dire predictions of catastrophic numbers and an overwhelming of our health system without it being either corrected or confirmed by the government,&quot; says Mr Peters.</p>
<p>“The latest data (as of 11am today) shows that only around 0.8% of all detected cases are in hospital – with zero in ICU. The government needs to answer how that compares with the modelling they have been using to take so many kiwis&#39; freedoms away.”</p>
