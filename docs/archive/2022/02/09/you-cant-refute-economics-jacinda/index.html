<p><strong>Wednesday, 9 February 2022, 3:08 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“The economists at Treasury have undermined the Prime Minister’s claim that the Government’s out-of-control spending has had no impact on rising prices”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“Last month, <a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=7EL176YFyxKF3ox3wD2rUare8I0bSkv63od33kHlNR5zUEytOZTUPESw__WcD9oS16gCiaQ_czoKje-jodP1MwU0FjTY-yEjTpuv26JoehxAMuqXNEiH4e8vd1CsIC-BfsLMa0xDpe6XkhUkRm596UWYBVmjzOq_Pwx0rPi5NC7gJ_-p35ZnVqSIiiL2Z2CGdmQAmOzL_N51rK3kHBY47Q&e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=can_t_refute_economics&n=2">Jacinda Ardern responded to a question</a> about whether government spending has led to higher inflation by saying, ‘I refute that, I absolutely refute that’.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=x7qo17qR1Kb0lLg85yQYfAbXTC6Z7wxyptuSZemzKnHW6MvSFOrjcviA_qc0F8nqMAK8WAGWyIPcZxaO8hw7yMIIh8SNZ9DQUsCyaj8Q8z7Bp9Io_VUsz68DcG2f2zb0gg_lB7uvwFvdC-Go8iLbbYDodoRULZnv5optl3JUP8zkbVbHwTjflyq7FygIli11&e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=can_t_refute_economics&n=3">However, advice provided by Treasury to the Finance Minister in October</a>, and obtained by ACT, says, ‘Increases in fiscal stimulus...have exerted inflationary pressures...by increasing aggregate demand’.</p>
<p>“That the Prime Minister is a communications graduate is no excuse for her ignorance – she has an army of bureaucrats to give her economic advice.</p>

<p>“Why can’t she just accept a basic economic truth? Inflation is the result of more money chasing fewer goods.</p>
<p>“The Reserve Bank has printed – and Labour has borrowed and spent – tens of billions of dollars in the past two years. That money is moving around the economy and pushing up the price of everything.</p>
<p>“Border restrictions and Red traffic light restrictions mean less is being produced and business costs are higher. New rules and new taxes push up prices as well.</p>
<p>“Prices have gone up 5.9 per cent. Wages have gone up just 2.6 per cent. Kiwis can buy less with their money – they’re getting poorer.</p>
<p>“Inflation is at a 31-year high and Kiwis are being squeezed from every direction – at the checkout, at the petrol pump, and when they pay the rent.</p>
<p>“The only adequate response is a return to rational economics.</p>
<p>ACT would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get borrowing and wasteful spending under control</li>
<li>Change the Reserve Bank legislation back to focusing on inflation only</li>
<li>Provide tax relief, cutting the 30 per cent tax rate to 17.5 per cent, giving the average worker an extra $2,000</li>
<li>Stop hitting businesses and productive people with new rules and taxes</li>
<li>Immediately allow all vaccinated, negative tested travellers into the country – New Zealanders, workers, students and tourists.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Jacinda Ardern is entitled to her own damaging opinions, but she can’t refute economics.”</p>
