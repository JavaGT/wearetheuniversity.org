<p>Two in three New Zealand adults support the government making public transport free for all users, according to the results of a new Horizon Research poll released today. The same poll found that 80 percent of adults support a permanent extension of half-price public transport for everyone, a finding that concurs with a recent 1News Kantar Public Poll.</p>

<p>“Affordable public transport is a key part of helping people to stay connected and to enjoy what our regions have to offer,” said Free Fares spokesperson Kate Day.</p>
<p>“Affordable public transport also reduces emissions. The Climate Change Commission recommended that the government reduce fares to encourage people to cut emissions by choosing public transport instead of private cars.</p>
<p>“The government has halved public transport fares and it is making a difference. One in three riders in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch used public transport more often in June and July because of the subsidy. As many as 15% of riders opted for public transport instead of private car.” (1)</p>
<p>“People are seeing their families more often, accessing healthcare and education, and enjoying recreation opportunities that used to be out of reach.”</p>

<p>“Free fares could make these benefits even more pronounced. Some New Zealanders - those aged 65+ with Supergold cards - already enjoy free public transport. The government has funded that scheme since 2008 and it has improved wellbeing and reduced trips by private car.</p>
<p>“We want to see more New Zealanders enjoy affordable public transport. The Free Fares coalition is calling on Transport Minister Michael Wood to make half-price public transport permanent for everyone. Given that polling shows 80 percent of adults support keeping half-price fares, it is the least they can do.</p>
<p>“We are also calling for free public transport for the groups that need it most: under-25s, tertiary students, Community Services Card holders and Total Mobility Card holders and their support people.</p>
<p>“Reducing fares is good value for money. Half-price public transport costs roughly one-tenth of the government’s cut to fuel excise tax and road user charges.(2)</p>
<p>“It is also critical that public transport is frequent and reliable, and that investment needs to happen along with affordable fares. In a climate emergency, we should use every available lever to reduce emissions.</p>
<p>“With four in five people wanting half-price fares to stay, and the benefits to wellbeing and the environment, the government should make half-price fares permanent. They should also go further by making public transport free for the groups that need it most.”</p>
