<p><strong>Sunday, 11 December 2022, 1:10 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Lawyer Angee Nicholas has been selected to stand for the National Party in the seat of Te Atatū in next year’s General Election.</p>
<p>“I’m thrilled to be selected as National’s candidate in the part of Auckland I call home and I can’t wait to get campaigning,” says Nicholas.</p>
<p>“As a local, I understand this community deeply and every day I see the effects of Labour’s economic mismanagement across Te Atatū. Families are struggling more than ever and the cost-of-living crisis will be my biggest priority if I earn the right to represent our community as its next MP.”</p>
<p>“I love this community and want to see it succeed. I believe our best chance to do that is under a Chris Luxon-led National Government that will address the cost-of-living crisis, crack down on the crime we see in Te Atatū and take New Zealand forward.</p>
<p>“Labour has taken West Auckland for granted for too long. People here are battling rising costs across the board, congestion and crime and want action and follow-through, not just announcements and promises with no delivery.</p>
<p>“Te Atatū is a diverse community that deserves a new voice to fight for its future as part of an energised National team. I’ll be working hard to be that voice.”</p>
