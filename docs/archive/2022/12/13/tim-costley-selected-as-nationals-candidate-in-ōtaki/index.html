<p><strong>Tuesday, 13 December 2022, 10:23 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Waikanae-based Tim Costley has been selected by local party members as National’s candidate in Ōtaki for the 2023 General Election.</p>

<p>“I’m incredibly aspirational for the Ōtaki electorate and I’m honoured to be given the opportunity to work hard for the support of our community as National’s candidate,” says Mr Costley.</p>
<p>“People in Horowhenua and Kāpiti are struggling thanks to a cost-of-living crisis fuelled by Labour’s economic mismanagement. Weekly rents in Horowhenua have increased by $180 under Labour, meaning a family paying the average rent has to find more than $9,000 extra every year. For families paying mortgages, it’s getting even worse with interest rates rising to try and keep a lid on rampant inflation. It’s clear Labour’s approach is taking us backwards.</p>
<p>“While National invested strongly in improving our roading infrastructure, people in our region have seen nothing but uncertainty and a lack of delivery from Labour when it comes to our roads. Projects like Ōtaki to North of Levin would be well underway if Labour hadn’t mucked us around.</p>
<p>“People in the Ōtaki electorate tell me they want a Government focused on the issues that matter to them like the cost-of-living crisis, and I know that a Chris Luxon-led National Government would do exactly that. I’m committed to working incredibly hard to deliver for our region as part of that team.</p>

<p>“I’m thrilled to hit the ground running to campaign for the support of our community and work hard to elect a National Government to take Ōtaki forward.”</p>
