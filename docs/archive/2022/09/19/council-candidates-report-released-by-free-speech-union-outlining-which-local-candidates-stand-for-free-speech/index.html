<p><strong>Monday, 19 September 2022, 1:43 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Free_Speech_Union">Free Speech Union</a></strong></p>
<p>A report collating hundreds of responses from local council candidates in each district across the country has been released by the Free Speech Union. This report will be a significant tool for the tens of thousands of supporters of the Free Speech Union, as they begin voting for candidates who will defend this basic freedom, says Jonathan Ayling, Spokesperson for the Union.</p>
<p>&quot;Kiwis deserve to know whether their political representatives will respect or harm their right to speak and believe. In the spirit of free speech, we have let the candidates speak for themselves on a number of key free speech issues, both nationally and in local government, alongside presenting our stance on these issues.</p>
<p>&quot;In making this report, the Free Speech Union sent a questionnaire to all candidates with emails published on council websites. We have also included in some regions cases of some candidates’ involvement on issues of free speech.</p>
<p>&quot;We asked each candidate 8 questions that outline whether they are free speech champions or the next cohort of censors shutting down local residents&#39; speech. In the introduction to the report, we unpack why we asked these questions, and why they indicate where these candidates stand on this important freedom.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe strongly in the right for politicians to hold and express their views openly. But to succeed in protecting and extending this basic freedom, we need to show them that they won&#39;t get away with shutting down the speech of others.</p>
