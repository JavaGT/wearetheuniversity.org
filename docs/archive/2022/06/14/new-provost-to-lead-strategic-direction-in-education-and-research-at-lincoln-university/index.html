<p>Renowned researcher in marine biosecurity and prominent member of the global academic community, Professor Chad Hewitt, has been appointed to a newly-created Provost position at Te Whare Wānaka o Aoraki Lincoln University.</p>

<p>Professor Hewitt’s aptitude for developing productive collaborative partnerships was also instrumental in his appointment.</p>
