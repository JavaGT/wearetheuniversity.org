<p><strong>Monday, 13 June 2022, 12:23 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>New Zealand should follow the United States’ lead and drop all pre-departure testing requirements for incoming passengers, National’s COVID-19 Response spokesperson Chris Bishop says.</p>
<p>“Australia did away with pre-departure testing weeks ago, and now the United States is following suit. The world is moving on, but New Zealand insists that anyone coming here must present a negative test before getting on a plane.</p>
<p>“Chris Hipkins admits the value of the pre-departure testing is now low and a month ago said that its ‘days were numbered&#39;.</p>
<p>“If the Government already thinks it has little value and plans to do away with it, why are we waiting until 31 July?</p>
<p>“Pre-departure tests made sense when we were pursuing elimination. But they make zero sense when we already have thousands of cases a day at home.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand businesses and tourism operators are crying out for support, and this is a simple, logical way to remove a barrier to coming here that is past its use by date.</p>
<p>“Kiwis can freely jump on a plane to Sydney but have to get a negative test before coming home, which is often costly, causes disruption to travel plans and makes short trips abroad significantly more complicated than they should be.</p>
<p>“A simple cost-benefit analysis would compel the government to do away with the tests right now.</p>
<p>“National has called for pre-departure testing to be abolished for weeks, and its time the Government came to the party.”</p>
