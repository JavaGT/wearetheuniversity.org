<p><strong>Wednesday, 12 October 2022, 2:43 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>Lincoln University has leaped one full level in the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings for 2023, also advancing its ranking from fifth-equal to fourth-equal out of the eight New Zealand universities.</p>
<p>In jumping to the 401-500 global band, Lincoln lifted its annual performance in four out of the five indicator categories, including a very significant increase of 8.3% in Citations, which represents the number of times the University’s academic research is acknowledged or cited by other researchers globally.</p>
<p>Lincoln achieved its highest world ranking of 24th (up from 28th in 2022) for the International Outlook category; a reflection of the University’s very strong connections with international students, research collaborations, industry partners, innovation hubs and other global networks.</p>
<p>The excellent 2023 result was welcomed by Vice-Chancellor Professor Grant Edwards, still in his first year at the helm of the University.</p>
<p>“As a specialist land-based university, Lincoln is focused on growing and strengthening our contribution to a prosperous and sustainable future for Aotearoa New Zealand’s primary sector and beyond, through our specialist education and research programmes.</p>
<p>“Lincoln University’s academic staff are high-quality researchers as well as teachers, who publish frequently in highly ranked peer-reviewed journals.</p>
<p>“Our distinctive and world-leading research programmes address many of the grand challenges facing the land-based sector, and our research outcomes consistently deliver innovative, practical and sustainable solutions to real-world problems.”</p>

<p>Lincoln graduates are the most employable cohort in Aotearoa [based on Post Qualification Outcomes Survey 2021], and their entry into their chosen career paths makes a positive, direct and immediate impact on the country’s food and fibre industries.</p>
<p>“Our 2023 world ranking, particularly our advancement relative to other institutions, clearly demonstrates that Lincoln University is delivering on our long-term strategy,” said Professor Edwards.</p>
<p>A record number of 1799 universities from 104 countries and regions participated in the 2023 THE World Rankings, making it the largest edition in the 19-year history of the rankings.</p>
