<p><strong>Sunday, 30 October 2022, 2:35 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Green Party has today <a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/excess_profits_tax">put forward proposals to ensure large corporations profiteering from high inflation are taxed fairly</a> and the money used to support people to make ends meet.</p>
<p>“An excess profit tax would be a simple and effective way for large corporations to pay their fair share, unlocking the resources all of us need to live with dignity, put a roof over our heads and food on the table,” says Green Party Finance spokesperson, Julie Anne Genter.</p>
<p>“Right now, as thousands of kids go hungry, supermarkets are raking in an excess profit of more than $1 million per day. As people struggle to pay the mortgage and their rent, Australian-owned banks are making record profits of over $6 billion. As tamariki go to sleep shivering, energy companies are generating eye-watering profits.</p>
<p>“And yet, having done nothing to earn it, nearly every dollar of excess corporate profit is going straight into the padded pockets of shareholders and corporate executives - rather being shared amongst all of us. This simply isn’t right.</p>
<p>“The Green Party does not accept large corporations making a killing in profits, while tens of thousands of families struggle to make ends meet. Our position is clear: when large corporations make excessive profits from a change in circumstances that affects us all, those benefits should be shared.</p>
<p>“We are committed to a fair and progressive tax system where the wealthiest pay their fair share so we can fund strong public services and ensure those with the least have enough to live on.</p>

<p>“Today, we have released a discussion document exploring how an excess profit tax could be designed - and how the additional revenue should be spent. We are also considering the alternative of raising company tax rates so that all profits are taxed more.</p>
<p>“Reflecting on a period of unprecedented growth in corporate profits, now is the time for a conversation about how we rebalance the tax system towards supporting the people who need it the most - and we invite all New Zealanders to have their say,” Julie Anne Genter.</p>
