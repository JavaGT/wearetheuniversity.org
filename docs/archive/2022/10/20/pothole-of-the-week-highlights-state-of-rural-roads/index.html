<p><strong>Thursday, 20 October 2022, 2:47 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National’s Pothole of the Week campaign is shining a light on just how bad New Zealand’s roads have become under Labour, and this includes our rural and regional roads, National’s Associate Transport spokesperson Matt Doocey says.</p>
<p>“The potholes around rural New Zealand are driving Kiwis crazy as our roads become billy-goat tracks. People are sick of the havoc this is causing their vehicles, and they’re telling us things are the worst they’ve seen them.</p>
<p>“The pothole photos are coming in from across the country and it’s not a pretty picture.</p>
<p>“From Cape Reinga in the Far North to Bluff in Invercargill, and all the rural and regional roads in between, the potholes are just dire.</p>
<p>“For people driving on rural highways, if a pothole causes serious damage to their vehicle in an area where there is limited cellphone coverage, they could be waiting hours for help.</p>
<p>“Kiwis are desperate to get the Government’s attention on this, using spray cans, taking a dip in the potholes and even some DIY concrete filling.</p>
<p>“While they should be repaired professionally, the frustration at the delay in pothole repairs is fair enough.</p>
<p>“It seems that Labour is so busy with their pet projects in Auckland and Wellington that they are missing out on doing the basics right in our regions.</p>
<p>“I could count on one hand the number of rural Kiwis in Canterbury and Southland who want to see up to $29.2 billion spent on Auckland light rail, but I don’t have enough hands for all the concerns about potholes.</p>
<p>“Transport Minister Michael Wood needs to fix our rural and regional potholes and stop wasting money on his pet projects.”</p>
<p>People can sign National’s petition at <a href="https://www.national.org.nz/fixthepotholes">national.org.nz/fixthepotholes</a> and send in their photos of potholes in their community via the National Party Facebook page.</p>
