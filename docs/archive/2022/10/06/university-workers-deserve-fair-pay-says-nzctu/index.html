<p><strong>Thursday, 6 October 2022, 2:14 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZCTU">NZCTU</a></strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand Council of Trade Unions stands in solidarity with the striking university workers today.</p>
<p>The strike, led by the Tertiary Education Union, Public Services Association, and E tū has seen 7000 people taking action.</p>
<p>NZCTU President Richard Wagstaff said the strike was a testament to the power of working people.</p>
<p>“These are academics, researchers, support staff. Every one of them deserves better pay, and better working conditions.</p>
<p>“These are the people who kept teaching all through the pandemic, facing extraordinary challenges and rising to meet them.</p>
<p>Wagstaff said the strike was the first of its kind in 20 years.</p>
<p>“This decision to strike was nearly unanimous at 87%. That’s across every university and every collective agreement. It’s time the universities listened to what their workers have to say.”</p>
