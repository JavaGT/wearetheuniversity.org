<p><strong>Tuesday, 24 May 2022, 10:18 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Green Party is calling for a Government COVID-19 Action Plan for schools, following expert advice about a possible winter COVID-19 peak.</p>
<p>“Where’s the plan? The Government needs to support schools and families so no one is left to muddle through winter by themselves,” says Teanau Tuiono, Green Party spokesperson for the COVID-19 response.</p>
<p>“Opening classroom windows as the outside temperatures plummet is not a good enough plan to keep children, young people, their teachers and whānau safe.</p>
<p>“We face a possible second COVID-19 peak over winter, at the same time as open borders bring new viruses into our communities. Communities need an expert-led plan to support children’s access to education, and protect children, school staff, and their families from COVID-19 and other winter respiratory infections.</p>
<p>“Our tamariki are growing and learning alongside severe threats to their wellbeing and that of their families.</p>
<p>“This generation is at risk of long-term harm to their health and wellbeing. We need a better approach as COVID-19 is still very much present in our communities. Now more than ever, with the risk of long COVID, we need to make sure support is equitable”</p>
<p>“Let’s not forget that as of last week we have now over 1000 COVID-19-related deaths. This pandemic is not over,” Teanau Tuiono says.</p>
<p>The plan should include:</p>
<p>· A stronger focus on indoor air quality - including ventilation, monitoring, and filtration. Relying on open windows is a stopgap measure and is insufficient for colder areas in winter.</p>

<p>· Require mask use in schools, in line with ‘red’ settings.</p>
<p>· Free N95s for teachers and students.</p>
<p>· Urgent steps to improve vaccine uptake against COVID-19 and the flu, and making sure kids are up to date with routine childhood vaccination - including catch up clinics in schools.</p>
<p>· Supporting staff and students to stay at home when they or their families are sick, with guaranteed sick leave for teachers until they are fully recovered.</p>
<p>· Supporting schools dealing with the impacts of long COVID and teacher shortages by increasing resourcing for relief teachers, and planning now for better teaching ratios long-term.</p>
<p>· Better planning to reduce transmission in schools while keeping them open as much as possible, for example, supporting large schools with timetabling changes that limit the risk of super-spreading.</p>
<p>· Clear and effective communication to parents - particularly on masks and vaccination.</p>
<p>· Ongoing reviews of the approach, so schools can learn from what’s going well and refine their plans if needed.</p>
