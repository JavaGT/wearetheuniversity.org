<p>If you are carrying a few extra kilos in weight, an extra apple or two per day might make a difference in boosting your immune system and helping ward off COVID-19 and winter illnesses.</p>
<p>New University of Otago, Christchurch research has identified, for the first time, exactly how much extra vitamin C humans need to ingest, relative to their body weight, to maximise their immune health.</p>
<p>The study, co-authored by Associate Professor Anitra Carr from the university’s Department of Pathology and Biomedical Science, has found that for every 10 kilograms of excess weight a person carries, their body needs an extra 10 milligrams of Vitamin C daily, which will help to optimise their immune health.</p>
<p>“Previous studies have already linked higher body weight with lower vitamin C levels,” says lead author Associate Professor Carr. “But this is the first study to estimate how much extra daily vitamin C is actually needed for people, relative to their body weight, to help maximise their health.”</p>
<p>Published in the international journal <em>Nutrients</em>, and co-authored with two researchers from the USA and Denmark, the study combined results from two earlier major international studies.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Carr says its novel findings have important implications for public health internationally- particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic – as vitamin C is an important immune-support nutrient and vital in helping the body protect itself from severe viral illnesses.</p>

<p>Although no studies have been carried out as yet specific to dietary intake for Covid-19, Associate Professor Carr suggests these findings could potentially help heavier people better protect themselves from such illnesses.</p>
<p>“We know obesity is a risk factor for getting COVID-19 and that obese patients are more likely to struggle to fight it off once infected. We also know that vitamin C is essential for good immune function and works by helping white blood cells fight infection. The results from this study therefore suggest that increasing your vitamin C intake if overweight might be a sensible response.</p>
<p>“Pneumonia is a major complication of COVID-19 and patients with pneumonia are known to be low in vitamin C. International research shows that vitamin C decreases the likelihood of people getting pneumonia and decreases the severity of it, so finding the right levels of vitamin C to take if you are overweight may help to better support your immune system,” says Associate Professor Carr.</p>
<p>The study determined how much vitamin C is required for people of higher body weight compared to a starting base weight of a 60 kilogram person consuming the average New Zealand dietary vitamin C intake of 110 milligrams per day, which most people achieve from a balanced diet. In other words, someone weighing 90 kilograms would need to take an extra 30 milligrams of vitamin C to achieve the optimal goal of 140mg/day; while someone weighing 120 kilograms would need at least an extra 40 milligrams of vitamin C daily to achieve the optimal 150mg/day.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Carr says the easiest way to increase daily vitamin C intake is by upping the consumption of vitamin C-rich foods such as fruits and vegetables or by taking a vitamin C supplement.</p>
<p>“The old saying of ‘an apple a day keeps the doctor away’ is actually useful advice here. An average-sized apple contains 10 milligrams of vitamin C, so if you weigh 70 to 80 kilograms, achieving the optimal amount of vitamin C your body needs could be as easy as eating an extra apple or two to give your body the extra 10 to 20 milligrams of daily vitamin C it needs. If you weigh more than this, then perhaps an orange, which contains 70 milligrams of vitamin C, or a kiwifruit with 100 milligrams, may be the easiest solution.”</p>
<p>However, she says for those who dislike eating fruit, have restricted diets such as people with diabetes, or struggle to access fresh fruit and vegetables due to financial barriers, taking a vitamin C supplement is a great alternative.</p>
<p>“There are a large variety of vitamin C supplements available over-the-counter, most are relatively cheap, safe to use and easily accessible from a local supermarket, pharmacy or online.</p>
<p>My advice for those who choose to get their vitamin C from a multivitamin, is to check the exact amounts of vitamin C per tablet, as some multivitamin formulations may only contain it in very low doses,” says Associate Professor Carr.</p>
