<p><strong>Saturday, 1 January 2022, 8:07 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“As we enter another year – ACT has some New Year’s Resolution ideas for Jacinda Ardern and her Government,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“Firstly, start listening.</p>
<p>“The Government has too many policies that divide people and divide wealth. It should dump them. Instead, we need policies that unite New Zealand behind good ideas to create wealth.</p>
<p>“The Government proved last year it was capable of listening on one issue – it scrapped the highly unpopular cycle bridge in Auckland.</p>
<p>“Here are some other things the Government should dump:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three Waters Reforms, complexity and division with questionable benefits</li>
<li>Fair Pay Agreements, compulsory unionism that will kill productivity growth</li>
<li>Another public holiday, paid for by employers</li>
<li>Scrapping interest deductibility on property investors mortgages</li>
<li>The COVID eradication response, failing despite the Government’s denials</li>
<li>Firearms reforms, alienated licenced firearm owners but did nothing for gun crime</li>
<li>Zero Carbon Act, an overcomplicated way of reducing emissions</li>
<li>Commercial property law changes, shaking confidence in the rule of law</li>
<li>Significant Natural Areas, confiscation for improving your property</li>
<li>Live Export Ban, an enormous economic cost based on faulty assumptions</li>
<li>Car Tax, impractical, inequitable, and won’t reduce carbon emissions on gram</li>
<li>Oil &amp; gas ban, destroying investor confidence in New Zealand</li>
<li>National Policy Statement on Freshwater, one-size-fits all and practical nowhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>“Those are just a few examples where the Government should listen to New Zealanders, back down from its ideological stance and do what’s right.</p>
<p>“ACT has plenty of positive policies the Government can replace these with, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Epidemic Response Unit to govern the response to COVID professionally and collaboratively</li>
<li>Student Education Accounts, so parents are in charge of the education budget</li>
<li>30-year infrastructure funding and planning partnerships to get infrastructure built in each region</li>
<li>Private insurance on new builds instead of costly council building inspections and get homes built</li>
<li>A Regulatory Responsibility Act to ensure law making consults and considers peoples’ rights</li>
<li>A Mental Health and Addictions agency to ensure the mental health dollar is efficiently spent</li>
<li>ACT’s alternative budget would cut taxes, and start repaying debt by 2025</li>
<li>Electronic income management for welfare, so the kids get the benefits</li>
<li>Gang injunction orders and tougher asset forfeiture laws, so organised crime doesn’t pay</li>
<li>A four-year term with independent select committees, so law making is sober and considered instead of rushed and reckless</li>
<li>A straightforward climate policy that links our emission levels to our competitors’</li>
</ul>
<p>“It’s a New Year and time for some new thinking. Here’s hoping Labour finally starts listening.”</p>
