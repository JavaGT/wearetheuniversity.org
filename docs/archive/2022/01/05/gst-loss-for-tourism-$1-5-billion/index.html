<p><strong>Wednesday, 5 January 2022, 8:02 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“New Zealand has taken a massive hit from our closed borders, with a loss of $1.5 billion in GST,” says ACT’s Tourism spokesperson James McDowall.</p>
<p>“While the loss of GST only tells part of the sad story of tourism and hospitality in 2021, it is $1.5 billion that can never be reinvested into the sectors or the economy at large.</p>
<p>“What we need this year from Tourism Minister Stuart Nash is clarity and certainty about the future of the industry.</p>
<p>“Tourism operators have done it tough. At the end of last year Nash told them it could be another 12-months before the borders open. Then he said there were “a whole lot of variables.”</p>
<p>“Tourism operators just want some certainty. Nash needs to come up with a plan. If Kiwis can return from Australia this month, is it really going to take another 12-months to open up to the rest of the world?</p>
<p>“Nash’s comments came as we record the lowest tourism expenditure since 2011, the COVID response and pandemic has sent tourism back a decade.</p>
<p>“The Tourism Satellite Account released in December show a reduction in tourism expenditure of $15.6 billion, the lowest direct value of tourism to GDP on record- a $7.7 billion reduction, the lowest number of people employed in tourism on record since 2000 and a $4.1 billion reduction from international student expenditure (for short term students).</p>
<p>“This year we need a plan to rebuild the sector. Tourism operators have been through hell and it’s time the Minister gave them some certainty.”</p>
