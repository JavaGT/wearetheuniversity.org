<p>“Papers presented to Cabinet by Workplace Relations Minister Michael Wood showed he tried to inflict even more pain on Kiwi businesses, with a much higher proposed minimum wage increase,” says ACT’s Small Business spokesperson Chris Baillie.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=cS9TqS4Q_p-ntHw6Br358S9yaYEmhrVXSntSf0iqfzhym9LxqheG56VeJHF6sfphsTXoyOB-i_p8cdiGeCuzGvrdcMhV85h5WBHpNyKCSExI1eNRBnmzElXwObzGJ1CoRUqi5jPpbiA3V6xJopSvag&e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=michael_wood_tried_to&n=2">The Cabinet Paper shows</a> Wood wanted a minimum wage of $21.40, his second option was $21.25, and in the end he only got $21.20. Presumably his colleagues could see how ludicrous his proposal was and shot it down.</p>
<p>“This shows the Minister’s fundamental lack of understanding of how small business works, as MBIE’s advice stated “With the recent lockdowns and continuing economic pressures on businesses, there is a risk that the additional wage costs may result in employers increasing prices, reducing workers’ hours, their staffing levels, or, for some vulnerable businesses, ceasing trade.”</p>
<p>“Inflation is at a 31-year high and Kiwis are being squeezed from every direction – at the checkout, at the petrol pump, and when they pay the rent.</p>
<p>“The Reserve Bank has printed – and Labour has borrowed and spent – tens of billions of dollars in the past two years. That money is moving around the economy and pushing up the price of everything.</p>
<p>“The only adequate response is a return to rational economics.”</p>
<p>ACT would:</p>
<p>• Get borrowing and wasteful spending under control</p>
<p>• Change the Reserve Bank legislation back to focusing on inflation only</p>
<p>• Provide tax relief, cutting the 30 per cent tax rate to 17.5 per cent, giving the average worker an extra $2,000</p>
<p>• Stop hitting businesses and productive people with new rules and taxes</p>
<p>• Immediately allow all vaccinated, negative tested travellers into the country – New Zealanders, workers, students and tourists.</p>
