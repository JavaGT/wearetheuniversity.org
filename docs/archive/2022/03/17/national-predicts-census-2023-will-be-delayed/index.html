<p><strong>Thursday, 17 March 2022, 4:33 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Government will announce a delay of the next Census until 2024, predicts National’s Statistics spokesperson Michael Woodhouse.</p>
<p>“Over the last few months, I have asked Statistics Minister David Clark a number of Written Parliamentary Questions about his confidence in the preparations for Census 2023. His answers have been evasive and vague.</p>
<p>“Minister Clark denies expressing concern about Statistics NZ’s ability to successfully undertake Census 2023, however my sources indicate the opposite, and that he has asked for a Cabinet Paper to be prepared listing options for a delay.</p>
<p>“Despite a material increase in personnel costs, Stats NZ are concerned about their ability to recruit the many staff required to support the Census, given the difficulty sourcing skilled staff.</p>
<p>“I believe the Government won’t risk the embarrassment of a similar debacle to the one they oversaw in 2018, six months out from the election, and will announce the delay until 2024.</p>
<p>“In order to avoid the costs of recruiting the hundreds of team leaders, and thousands of Census takers which will commence around November, I expect this announcement to be made around July or August this year.</p>
<p>“The Government will predictably use Covid-19 as an excuse, but the real reason is their failure to plan ahead and a lack of motivation from the Minister to ensure a successful Census.”</p>
