<p>“The Government is increasing dependency on welfare with increases to the benefit while businesses struggle to get ahead and employ more people,” says ACT’s Social Development spokesperson Karen Chhour.</p>
<p>“On Friday, benefits will increase by an average of $20 a week. Instead of seeing benefits as the solution, Labour needs to get to the root of poverty by growing the economy and fixing our education system.</p>
<p>“Labour is making it harder to employ people and easier to remain on a benefit.</p>
<p>“Small businesses are being stung with minimum wage increases that outstrip productivity, so-called ‘fair pay’ agreements that will bog businesses down in red tape, a new tax to pay for employment insurance, more sick leave that will cost businesses $1 billion, and another public holiday that will cost them $450 million. No wonder so many business owners are giving up.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, we have 266,736 people who’ve been on a benefit for more than 12 months – an increase of 63,786 since 2017.</p>
<p>“Slowly but surely, Labour is transforming welfare in a way that will increase dependency by making benefits more generous and removing obligations on welfare recipients.</p>
<p>“Welfare should be about helping people get back on their feet, not allowing them to abuse the system and depend on the state. Welfare should not be a lifestyle choice.</p>
<p>“Almost 188,000 adults are receiving the Jobseeker benefit, yet we have severe labour shortages in many sectors that are not being addressed.</p>
<p>“What does it say about Jacinda Ardern&#39;s Government’s attitude towards the value of work that thousands more New Zealanders are now at the mercy of Government handouts.</p>
<p>“We need to be encouraging these New Zealanders back into the labour market, not incentivising them to stay on welfare.</p>
