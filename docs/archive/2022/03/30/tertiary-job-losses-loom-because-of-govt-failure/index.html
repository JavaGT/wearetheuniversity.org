<p><strong>Wednesday, 30 March 2022, 4:05 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Government urgently needs to get international students into the country to prevent looming job losses in the tertiary sector, National’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Penny Simmonds says.</p>
<p>“Universities and polytechnics are currently considering staff redundancies as a way of coping with declining enrolments this year.</p>
<p>“Labour is allowing 5000 international students into the country next month - but universities and polytechnics can only access 2150 students, or 43 per cent, with the remainder of students heading to high schools, Private Training Establishments and English language schools.</p>
<p>“This will do little to ease the urgent staffing issues facing the sector.</p>
<p>“Given that student visas are currently taking Immigration New Zealand three months to process, students applying in April won’t be processed in time for semester two, putting further stress on our valuable tertiary teaching staff.</p>
<p>“On top of that, international research now shows New Zealand is falling out of favour with international students, being ranked last among the major English-speaking education destinations in a survey of more than 10,000 people from 93 countries.</p>
<p>“And the effects are obvious - according to the Ministry of Education in 2019, New Zealand had about 22,000 fulltime international students paying total tuition fees of $562 million. The figures for 2021 and 2022 are estimated to be 70 per cent of that 2019 figure.</p>
<p>“The Government must explain what the rational is for limiting international student numbers, our fourth biggest export earner, when the border is reopening.</p>
<p>“It is appalling that this Government has allowed international education in this country to decline to this level. We must act urgently to prevent further deterioration in this sector and that means not restricting international student numbers coming here.”</p>
