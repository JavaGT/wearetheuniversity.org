<p><strong>Sunday, 31 July 2022, 1:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>A National Government will restore the basic principle that all New Zealanders have equal voting rights, National’s Justice spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>“It’s astounding that any party should have to make such a promise – given most Kiwis take equal voting rights for granted – but that basic principle is being undermined by the Labour Government.</p>
<p>“On Wednesday, Labour and the Greens are set to vote for the third reading of the Canterbury Regional Council (Ngāi Tahu Representation) Bill. The legislation removes both equal voting rights in that region, as well as the basic principle of democratic accountability.</p>
<p>“The Bill will give Ngāi Tahu the right to appoint two councillors. Since Māori will have had an equal vote in the appointment of the other 14 councillors, this arrangement gives Ngāi Tahu voters extra voting power.</p>
<p>“Since the Ngāi Tahu appointments are permanent, the normal rules of accountability do not apply. The universal principle that politicians are better behaved when they know they can be thrown out at the next election, will not apply for these councillors in Canterbury.</p>
<p>“Once this Bill is passed this week, against strong opposition from National, we can be sure that other regions will try to follow.</p>
<p>“Labour members on the Māori Affairs Committee are still trying to resurrect the Rotorua District Council (Representation Arrangements) Bill, which would move away from equal rights for the Rotorua District Council.</p>
<p>“This is anti-democratic and divisive.</p>

<p>“This morning on Q&amp;A, when quizzed on whether co-governance in Three Waters gave Māori disproportionate power, the Prime Minister’s only response was that “democracy is democracy”.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders don’t need meaningless blather from the Prime Minister. They need a resolute defence of basic democratic principles.</p>
<p>“Equal voting rights and accountability at the ballot box are basic principles and National will restore them if returned to office in 2023.”</p>
