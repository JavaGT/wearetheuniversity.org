<p><strong>Monday, 25 July 2022, 6:22 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology">Auckland University of Technology</a></strong></p>
<p>COVID-19 exacerbated existing labour market disparities between NZ European and Pacific Peoples – particularly for Pacific women, those under 30, and those living in Auckland.</p>
<p>New research by AUT’s NZ Work Research Institute (NZWRI) shows how the COVID-19 pandemic and associated policy responses affected the labour market outcomes for Pacific Peoples relative to NZ Europeans.</p>
<p>Commissioned by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), <strong>The Pacific workforce and the impact of COVID-19</strong> report found:</p>
<p>Pre-pandemic ethnic disparities between NZ European and Pacific are prevalent in terms of job-entry wages after a period of non-employment (known as “wage scarring”) and limited wage progression for those who are employed.</p>
<p>The pandemic amplified ethnic disparities for Pacific Peoples particularly among Pacific women, those under 30, and those living in Auckland.</p>
<p>Young Pacific people living in Auckland during 2021 most acutely felt the impact of COVID-19 on their labour market outcomes.</p>
<p>Estimated ethnic labour market disparities were greater in 2021 than in 2020.</p>
<p>Pacific workers tend to work in industries hit the hardest in terms of lower wage growth during COVID-19 – specifically, manufacturing and construction for Pacific men, and manufacturing, healthcare, and social assistance for Pacific women.</p>
<p>Researchers examined a variety of labour market indicators:</p>
<p><strong>Job entry and benefit dependence</strong>: including the probability of entering employment; the wage level when starting employment; and the likelihood of receiving benefits</p>

<p><strong>Job and wage mobility</strong>: includes wage progression of those that remain employed</p>
<p><strong>Job separation</strong>: including the probability of exiting employment, and the likelihood of receiving benefits if exited employment.</p>
<p>NZWRI director, AUT Professor Gail Pacheco, says that pre-pandemic disparities in the Pacific labour market are persistent, and they were felt most keenly by specific Pacific groups during COVID-19.</p>
<p>“While the NZ labour market was generally robust during the pandemic, it seems that not everyone managed to benefit from it.”</p>
<p>Professor Pacheco says the report shows change is needed at a systemic level.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 has amplified the prevalence of ethnic disparities in the workforce, but it did not create those disparities in the first place. Therefore, policy needs to not only tackle recent COVID-related disruptions to the workforce but be long-term focused on addressing the entrenched disparities evident before the pandemic hit,” says Professor Pacheco.</p>
<p>Kirsty Flannagan, General Manager Economic Strategy, who oversees Langa Le Vā Pacific Policy Team at MBIE, who commissioned and funded the report, acknowledged the report’s findings.</p>
<p>“Pacific people in Aotearoa have long experienced disparity in the labour market. This research indicates the positive impact of the Government&#39;s wage subsidy for Pacific people during COVID but also highlights the work that needs to continue to address labour market inequities and continue to grow Aotearoa New Zealand for all.”</p>
<p>The NZWRI report uses Stats NZ Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI). The IDI is a large research database holding microdata about people and households that is sourced from government agencies, Stats NZ surveys, and non-government organisations (NGOs).</p>
<p>The study draws on population data from the 2018 Census, matched with Inland Revenue’s monthly information on earnings and the Ministry of Social Development’s data on benefits.</p>
