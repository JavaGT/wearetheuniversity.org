<p><strong>Thursday, 21 July 2022, 10:27 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“ACT welcomes the release of the <a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=fk3qs1mHicx9-w03tafB2G8vNGMp4KGcuuJPtVN2Yhb4Nk7GCDFzScEaViF-rC5QMJJ3MgeyNblFv-oH-I9pjRA3Cb_xZBRMt1lVCHgmIgWoicttDdOS4Uxahfm_RJjd0CG0mt28kS5eb2xUv-XOkqCfIIG2M6UB-YGsHVDJ1WzNTDOJFFXZcwVGm-PWB9Qb&e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=first_as&n=2">first annual report</a> by the Registrar of Assisted Dying Services, it shows the law works as intended, and criticisms made before it passed were unfounded,” says ACT’s Deputy Leader and Health spokesperson Brooke van Velden.</p>
<p>“The report shows the law is working as it was intended. A small but significant number of New Zealanders wished to access Assisted Dying. 206 applicants in five months suggests nearly two per cent of people who die in a year are applying. The numbers are in line with international trends. </p>
<p>“Of those applying, some have been declined and others have gone ahead, others appear to have changed their mind. All of this is consistent with a law that has rigorous safeguards and supports personal choice.</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s medical professionals have stepped up to support choice for those who are suffering. During the debate, opponents said there would not be medical practitioners willing to help suffering patients through an assisted dying process, but the report shows 130 have made themselves available. They are spread up and down the country, including 44 in the South Island.</p>

<p>“Opponents said that there would be problems with the law, but there have been no complaints about breaches of the Act. There have been four complaints about the Assisted Dying Service, three of which were resolved by the time of the report. </p>
<p>“We say that a society should be judged by how it treats its most vulnerable. Our country now gives those who face terrible suffering at the end of their life compassion and choice. </p>
<p>“I&#39;m proud of the work ACT and David Seymour did to champion the End of Life Choice Act through Parliament and through a nationwide referendum.</p>
<p>“We heard overwhelmingly from thousands of members of the public at public meetings, in person, and in the referendum result that this is a choice they wished for themselves and others.”</p>
