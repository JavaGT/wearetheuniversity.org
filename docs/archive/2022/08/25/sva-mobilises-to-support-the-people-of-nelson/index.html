<p><strong>Thursday, 25 August 2022, 2:38 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Student_Volunteer_Army">Student Volunteer Army</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>SVA is partnering with Nelson College to mobilise and assist the people of Nelson and Tasman in response to devastating floods in the region.</strong></p>
<p>50 students have already committed to providing their support, and more volunteers are welcome to sign up via SVA at the following address: <a href="https://volunteer.sva.org.nz/programmes/128">https://volunteer.sva.org.nz/programmes/128</a></p>
<p>Residents can request help by calling SVA on 0800 005 902, emailing <a href="mailto:hello@sva.org.nz">hello@sva.org.nz</a>, or by filling in the form on SVA&#39;s website at <a href="https://sva.org.nz/nelson-floods/">https://sva.org.nz/nelson-floods/</a>  
 </p>
<p>Sam Johnson, co-founder and Chief Executive of SVA, is enthusiastic about using SVA&#39;s skills and experience to support volunteers in the region: &quot;SVA steps up when we&#39;re needed, and we&#39;ve had plenty of experience with floods and silt. We&#39;re really proud to be working alongside the students of Nelson College and providing our systems to help coordinate volunteers.&quot;  
 </p>
<p>Matt Donald, a student from Nelson College helping to organise their volunteers agreed: &quot;When the floods struck Nelson, I knew a massive response was needed to get our community back together. We’ve all seen the pictures of the damage in our region, and I thought the students and other rangatahi could make a real difference by coming together and supporting our community.&quot;</p>
