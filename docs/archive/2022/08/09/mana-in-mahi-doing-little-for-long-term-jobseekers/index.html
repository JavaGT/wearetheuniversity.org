<p><strong>Tuesday, 9 August 2022, 4:43 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>New figures reveal that Mana in Mahi is doing little to reduce long-term benefit dependency among young people, National’s Social Development and Employment spokesperson Louise Upston says.</p>
<p>“The number of 18 to 24-year-olds on the Jobseeker benefit for more than one year has almost doubled under Labour.</p>
<p>“It makes no sense that more young people are stuck on the Jobseeker benefit long-term when businesses are crying out for workers. Currently, more than 13,000 18 to 24-year-olds have spent longer than one year on the Jobseeker benefit.</p>
<p>“In response, the Prime Minister claimed that Mana in Mahi was supporting young people on a benefit - a claim that is clearly contradicted by new data provided to National.</p>
<p>&quot;The data shows that Mana in Mahi has supported an annual average of 178 people into work who have spent longer than one year on a benefit.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that Labour’s programme is only helping 178 of the 13,000 young people every year proves that the Prime Minister’s claims are disingenuous at best and misleading at worst.</p>
<p>“In fact, almost half of Mana in Mahi participants were not on any benefit when they began their placement.</p>
<p>“Instead of delivering more spin, it is time Labour started delivering for our most at-risk young New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“National’s approach will bring in community-based providers who will have job coaches to identify any barriers preventing young Jobseekers from getting a job, develop an individualised job plan for each Jobseeker, provide encouragement and apply a reward/sanction approach where warranted.</p>
<p>“National’s Welfare that Works policy will increase support to thousands of young people that Labour has abandoned.”</p>
