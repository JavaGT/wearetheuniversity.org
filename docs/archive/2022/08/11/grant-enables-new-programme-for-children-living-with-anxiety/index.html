<p><strong>Thursday, 11 August 2022, 11:48 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>An exciting new programme to help children living with anxiety is able to go ahead following a generous donation from the Sir Campbell and Lady Leita Wylie Foundation.</p>
<p>The latest programme from Triple P parenting courses, Fear-Less, is being run by the Pukemanu Centre, the Child and Family Psychology Services based at the University of Canterbury.</p>
<p>Clinic Director Suzi Hall says following the challenges experienced through the COVID-19 outbreak, there is a significant need for more services to help with anxiety and emotional well-being.</p>
<p>“We’ve had to regularly close our waitlists because of high demand, and we urgently needed to expand our support to families. The Fear-Less Triple P programme is evidence based, resulting in good outcomes for managing anxiety. Its group format will allow us to see more families so that we can expand our support services.</p>
<p>“The additional funding means we’ve been able to provide more staff and resources to meet the needs of these families.</p>
<p>“We’re hoping to help up to 250 children over three years who we might not otherwise have been able to see. These are children aged 6-14 years who have moderate to high levels of anxiety that causes distress or impacts on their everyday functioning. It also targets siblings and parents.”</p>
<p>Ms Hall says research shows that fewer than one in five children with anxiety receive any kind of intervention and intervention is more effective if parents and siblings are involved.</p>
<p>Established nine years ago, the Pukemanu Centre provides free assessments and interventions on a short-term basis for more than 150 children and whānau each year who are unable to access other services for financial, eligibility or waiting time reasons.</p>

<p>The Centre is managed by registered psychologists and operates as part of the professional training course for Masters level students and above, who are currently undertaking advanced post-graduate training in Child and Family Psychology at the University of Canterbury. Students are involved with all Centre activities, working alongside senior registered psychologists.</p>
<p>The Sir Campbell and Lady Leita Wylie Foundation is a long-time donor to the Child and Family Psychology Programme.</p>
