<p><strong>NORTHLAND’S YOUTH MP ANNOUNCED</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters is pleased to announce Kii Small, of Kaitaia, as the representative for Northland in the Youth Parliament 2016.</p>
<p>Kii, 18, attended Kaitaia College and recently started a Bachelor of Commerce degree, in international business and political science, at Victoria University of Wellington.</p>
<p>“His essay about lifting voter turnout of Kiwi youth impressed the judges,” Mr Peters said.</p>
<p>Applicants were asked to write a 600-word essay setting out a new policy that should be taken up by a New Zealand government. The essays were submitted anonymously to a three-person panel.</p>
<p>“The calibre of applications received was very high and it was pleasing to have such a talented and enthusiastic field to choose from,” Mr Peters said.</p>
<p>“We acknowledge the time and energy spent by all applicants during the selection process and thank them for their hard work. They demonstrated initiative that will serve them well in future endeavours.”</p>
<p>Youth Parliament 2016 will take place on July 19-20, bringing together 121 Youth MPs from across the country. Youth MPs take on the role from January 25 to July 25, 2016. During this time, they will actively engage with the community to gain an understanding of the ideas and concerns of youth in the area.</p>
<p>“I would like to publicly acknowledge the time and effort the panel put into the judging. It is very much appreciated,” said Mr Peters.</p>
