<p><strong>Student Leaders Say Goff Must Prove He’s on the Side of Students</strong></p>
<p><strong>Auckland University Students’ Association</strong></p>
<p><strong>November 5th, 2015</strong></p>
<p><strong>AUCKLAND</strong> - Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA) is urging Phil Goff to make student issues one of his priorities in his campaign for the Auckland Mayoralty.</p>
<p>The call comes after today’s news that Mr Goff will be formally announcing his Mayoral bid on November 22nd.</p>
<p>AUSA President-elect Will Matthews said: “We welcome the competition and credibility that Phil Goff injects into the race for the Mayoralty but we challenge him, and all other candidates, to prove they are deserving of student support.</p>
<p>“Auckland students make up 50 per cent of the nationwide student population. That means any candidate who can prove they are on the side of students will be able to tap into a formidable voting base.”</p>
<p>“Skilled and well educated young people are the future of our country yet many students, particularly in Auckland, face significant financial struggles. We want to see clear policies and commitment on housing, public transport and employment issues in Auckland.”</p>
<p>According to the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) Income and Expenditure Survey 2015, Auckland students face the highest average rents in the country, forcing them further from the city to find affordable accommodation.</p>
<p>Many students are also being forced to take on debt in addition to their student loans to pay for other expenses. For those who are able to find jobs, salary rates are often insufficient to cover the cost of rent, food, power, public transport and other necessities.</p>

<p>“Students should not be expected to take on additional debt to be able to live and study, while also having to face the prospect of not being able to afford a home in the future.</p>
<p>“Another issue is public transport. As students get pushed further away from the city, it becomes more difficult and expensive to travel in to University. In addition to tackling the housing problem, we would like to see bigger subsidies for students on public transport. Furthermore, more needs to be done to integrate the Auckland public transport system with the universities in the CBD. The City Rail Link project is an improvement, but doesn&#39;t go far enough in ensuring that the Universities are accessible. We want to see more done to ensure that public transport is not only more affordable for students, but also simple and direct.</p>
<p>“This shows that Auckland students are struggling in a city that is supposedly one of the most liveable in the world.</p>
<p>“This is an unacceptable and unsustainable situation for students living in Auckland, and we urge Phil Goff to address this in his campaign and if he becomes Mayor.</p>
<p>“This is a chance for Mr Goff to depart from his legacy of the 1980s as the architect of the student loan system and work to bring about real change for a large group of people who are vital to the Auckland economy and the future of New Zealand.”</p>
