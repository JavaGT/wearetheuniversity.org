<p>Thousands of Kiwi climate marchers challenge Govt to show leadership  </p>
<p>The tens of thousands of Kiwis who marched in solidarity around the country today sent a loud and clear message to the Government that they want a climate change plan New Zealand can be proud of, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>The New Zealand People’s Climate Marches, which continue tomorrow, are part of a worldwide weekend of action to urge political leaders to agree to a meaningful plan to combat climate change at the upcoming COP talks in Paris.</p>
<p>“Tens of thousands of New Zealanders have stood up for the climate today – it’s time John Key and the Government did the same,” said Green Party Co-leader James Shaw, who was one of the more than 15,000 people who marched in Auckland.</p>
<p>“The Paris COP talks are an opportunity for New Zealand to show leadership on a global scale but we’re heading there with one of the most woefully low pollution-reduction targets in the world.</p>
<p>“The Government’s current plan for reducing domestic climate pollution is completely inadequate, and that message was heard loud and clear today, all around the country.</p>
<p>“The nationwide action today was reminiscent of the massive marches against this Government’s plan to mine our national parks, which they finally ditched after listening to the people.</p>
<p>“The Government should listen to the thousands of New Zealanders who took to the streets today and come up with a stronger, more ambitious plan for reducing climate pollution.</p>
<p>“The whole world will be watching Paris ­– this is the opportunity of a lifetime and New Zealand must step up and show some leadership,” said Mr Shaw.</p>
