<p>Mouthguard design eases detection of concussion</p>
<p>Rugby may be over for another season but industrial design student Spencer Buchanan believes he has created a device that makes it easier to identify and manage concussions in the sport.</p>
<p>His prototype mouthguard Nerve features microelectronics, including motion sensors, within the middle layer of the design. The data received from the mouth guard is linked to a sideline iPad that accumulates the player’s percentage of concussion risk based on an algorithm. It identifies where on the head a player has sustained an impact injury while also providing previous concussion history and pre-season baseline tests.</p>
<p>Mr Buchanan, who suffered several concussions playing rugby and snowboarding, says his design allows sideline medical staff to make more accurate decisions as to whether a player should continue playing on after suffering a head knock.</p>
<p>“My design picks up impacts missed by the human eye and transfers the data to side line staff,” he says.</p>
<p>“It allows the sideline doctor to rapidly decide with the benefit of accurate real time data if a player needs to come off the field for rehabilitation to minimise the possibility of second impact syndrome [multiple injuries in a game].”</p>
<p>His design is part of the annual Exposure exhibition of work by final year design students at Massey’s College of Creative Arts, exhibiting now till November 21.</p>
<p>Mr Buchanan has been in contact with professional rugby doctors and a medical researcher who has had experience with testing wearable technology on players. They were interested and excited about his design.</p>

<p>“Wearable technology is an emerging trend in contact sport and this design adds something new to it.”</p>
<p>The mouthguard is designed to be custom-made to fit the individual requirements of players and its microelectronics are laminated within the design to prevent any health and safety concerns too.</p>
<p>Mr Buchanan, who is originally from Warkworth, says treatment of rugby injuries has come a long way in recent years and he applauds measures such as the mandatory stand-down period for any player concussed.</p>
<p>“I love the game and it hasn’t stopped me playing the game, I just think the issue of concussion could still be managed better.</p>
<p>“Clinical assessment over-rides any technology but this helps sideline officials and management make informed decisions.”</p>
