<p><strong>Monday, 16 November 2015, 11:34 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National Party List MP Based in Wellington Central<br>Media Statement<br>16 November 2015</p>
<p>Local student selected as Youth MP</p>
<p>Paul Foster-Bell MP congratulates Summer O’Dywer of Samuel Marsden Collegiate on her selection as his Youth MP.</p>
<p>Summer is a Year 12 student and winner of her school’s prestigious Helen Davidson Scholarship for 2015. Summer studies sciences, languages, photography and advanced calculus.</p>
<p>As part of the Young Enterprise scheme, Summer is CEO of a student team developing a “Just Ask” app to provide tips to help other students who struggle with study.</p>
<p>“It was this sort of outward thinking about other students as well as work ethic and commitment that mark out Summer as having the right skills to be a Youth MP,” Mr Foster-Bell said.</p>
<p>“Summer will work for the youth of Wellington and to make our city a better place during her tenure as my Youth MP.”</p>
<p>Summer said she has two goals as a Youth MP. “I want to connect students to politics and educate them on how important voting and engaging is for our country,” Summer said.</p>
<p>“I’ll also work to have Wellington students’ issues heard in our Parliament so that we can start to make change where it’s needed.”</p>
<p>Before the Youth Parliament next July Summer plans to engage with as many students as possible by going around schools and running after-school workshops to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to get their views across.</p>
