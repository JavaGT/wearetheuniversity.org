<p><strong>Schools encouraged to enter PM’s Education Excellence Awards</strong>  </p>
<p>National List MP based in the Hutt Valley Chris Bishop is encouraging Lower Hutt early childhood services and schools to enter the Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards which open today.</p>
<p>“I grew up in Lower Hutt and I know from experience that it is excellent teachers, excellent early childhood services, and excellent schools that transform lives,” says Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards are an opportunity to showcase the important work our educators are doing in the Hutt Valley.</p>
<p>“The future of the Hutt Valley lies in the hands of our young people. We need to support and nurture their education, and one way of doing this is by supporting and recognising those who take the lead in this area.”  </p>
<p>The award categories vary from excellence in governing, excellence in leading, excellence in teaching and learning, and excellence in engaging. Entry is open to early childhood, primary and secondary sectors as well as Communities of Learning.</p>
<p>“New Zealand has an excellent education system with outstanding teachers, principals and leaders. We should always aim to do better, and these awards recognise the collective effort and collaboration we need to provide the best for our kids,” says Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>The winning entry in each category will receive $20,000 and a professional development opportunity. The winner of the Prime Minister’s Supreme Award for the partnership or group that has had the most impact on raising student achievement will receive an additional $30,000.</p>
<p>The 2016 Education Focus Prize will be for initiatives that improve the health and wellbeing of children and young people.</p>
<p>Entries close on 18 March 2016. Entry forms and information are available <a href="https://www.pmawards.education.govt.nz/enter/">here</a>. Finalists will be announced in May 2016.</p>
