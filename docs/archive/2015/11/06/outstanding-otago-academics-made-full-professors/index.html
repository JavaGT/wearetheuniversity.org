<p><strong>Outstanding Otago academics made full professors</strong></p>
<p>Seventeen University of Otago academics—across a spectrum of research fields—have been promoted to full professor.</p>
<p>At Otago, full professorships are conferred only after a rigorous selection process that thoroughly evaluates academic quality and involves input from international experts.</p>
<p>Candidates must have demonstrated records of sustained excellence and outstanding leadership in research, teaching, and service to the University and their external communities. The promotion criteria at Otago are particularly rigorous.</p>
<p>Announcing the new professorships, Vice-Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne warmly congratulated the 17 Otago staff on their success.</p>
<p>“These well-earned promotions are going to leading academics from across our Dunedin, Christchurch, and Wellington campuses and clearly reflect the range and depth of world-class scholarship at this university.”</p>
<p>Otago’s new professors are: Colin Brown (Physiology), Peter Dearden (Biochemistry), Claire Freeman (Geography), Jonathan Hall (Classics), Patricia Langhorne (Physics), Derelie Mangin (General Practice, University of Otago, Christchurch), Sally McCormick (Biochemistry), Tony Merriman (Biochemistry), David O’Hare (Psychology), Holger Regenbrecht (Information Science), Poia Rewi (Te Tumu), Jacinta Ruru (Law), Diana Sarfati (Public Health, Wellington), Abigail Smith (Marine Science), Darryl Tong (Oral Diagnostic and Surgical Sciences), James White (Geology), Nicholas Wilson (Public Health, University of Otago, Wellington).</p>
<p>The academics take up their new titles from 1 February 2016.</p>
