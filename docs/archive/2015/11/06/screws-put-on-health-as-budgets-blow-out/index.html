<p>Screws put on health as budgets blow out</p>
<p>More than half the country’s health boards have blown out their budgets just months into the new financial year, Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“A report to Jonathan Coleman on the financial performance of our district health boards shows that in just the second month of the 2015/16 financial year 13 are in the red to the tune of $8.4 million.</p>
<p>“Not only that but four DHBs – Lakes, Capital and Coast, Hutt Valley and MidCentral - are also under closer financial scrutiny, while a financial review of Tairawhiti is about to begin.</p>
<p>“This follows a review of Canterbury DHB by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).</p>
<p>“The strife they are in is not about their own poor management, but is a consequence of the Government not funding them to keep up with inflation and population growth pressures.</p>
<p>“An Infometrics report has confirmed Health has been underfunded by $1.7 billion over the last six years.</p>
<p>“No health board wants to compromise patient care, but if budgets are being screwed down then something’s got to give. Figures provided by Mr Coleman’s office show a shortfall of some $152 million this year.</p>
<p>“We know there’s increasing numbers of people being turned down for specialist treatment, and we know emergency departments aren’t coping with rising numbers of people turning up with mental health issues.</p>
<p>“Staff are being told that sticking to budgets and targets is more important than patient safety and quality care.</p>
<p>“For a country that prides itself on a health system that puts those last two things at the top of the priority list that is disgraceful,” Annette King says.</p>
