<p><strong>Sound science point of difference for Waipara winemakers</strong></p>
<p>More than two decades of soil science work in the Waipara area has been brought together in a document launched at a Vineyard Soils Day at Black Estate Vineyard this week.</p>
<p>The document was received with enthusiasm as an invaluable resource by local wine growers, who acknowledged the potential for far greater collaboration in research initiatives between wine growers and Lincoln University.</p>
<p>Former Lincoln University soil scientist Dr Philip Tonkin, Associate Professor Peter Almond, current Head of the Soil and Physical Sciences Department, Trevor Webb from Landcare Research, and other scientists, have spent the best part of the last two years drawing together available information on the geology and soils of the region gathered in the last 20 years, along with the records of former Soil Bureau surveys.</p>
<p>The result is a record which Dr Tonkin says all wine growing regions should aim for, and that while there is an accepted body of knowledge among wine growers, being able to put theories to a scientific test is ideal. “I want this to be a blueprint for what should be achieved in other areas where viticulture is practised,” he told wine growers, wine industry representatives and Lincoln academics presenting their research findings at the seminar.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Almond says, “Dr Tonkin has provided detailed information on the soil patterns within vineyards to help with planting and management. His knowledge will serve as the fundamental reference for anyone interested in the landscape history and soil resources of the region, especially as they relate to growing grapes and giving the local wines a unique sense of identity.”</p>
<p>Following the seminar, Black Estate winemaker Nicholas Brown said, “Judging by the feedback I have received from growers it is clear that there is a lot of interest in seeing the final report and then using that information to better understand our region and more clearly promote its character to our markets.”</p>
<p>The Waipara region is home to at least 70 vineyards growing on distinctive landforms and an impressive variety of soils, with the Omihi Valley having some of the most fertile in New Zealand according to Associate Professor Almond.</p>
<p>Speaking at the seminar, Associate Professor Roland Harrison, Director of Lincoln University’s Centre for Viticulture and Oenology, said that although the concept of “terroir” - the relationship between wine and the parent materials in which vines grow - is well-recognised by wine growers, wine makers and consumers, it is tenuous and at times merely anecdotal. However soil attributes are relevant to heat, water storage and drainage, and in this way do influence wine qualities. “We are better off thinking about what soil does, for example its influence on growth, than simply about the rocks from which the soils are derived.”</p>
<p>Associate Professor Harrison told local vineyard owners that getting to know their soils better is an integral part of promoting their vineyards and that the document is another step forward in marketing at cellar doors. “Looking at the whole geology of an area is useful for understanding and telling the “story” of a vineyard. Celebrating differences and variety and diversity is crucial for marketing and the landscape here reflects these.</p>
<p>Dr Tonkin added that while the document gives growers information, the process goes both ways and feedback from those using the information is required to confirm its content and get everyone “talking about things in a consistent manner.” Wine growers at the seminar welcomed the chance to be able to accurately describe local soils and give visitors more in-depth information.</p>
<p>In his presentation on “Understanding the Landscape” Tonkin explained the geology of the Waipara region, describing it as a dynamic landscape which still growing, albeit at the rate of a fingernail, and as part of the earthquake sequence which struck Christchurch from 2010 onwards. Associate Professor Almond then put the “soil story” into the landscape story, and illustrated the ways in which soils relate to the landforms they come from.</p>
<p>Dr Amber Parker presented a snapshot of her research findings around grapevine phenology, berry ripening and climate, while Associate Professor Harrison explored the ways in which the document could be used by wine growers and the contribution of soils to wine attributes. Dr Glen Creasy elaborated on research work around irrigation in the area, a topic close to the hearts of local growers as water becomes a more contested issue in an erratic climate.</p>
