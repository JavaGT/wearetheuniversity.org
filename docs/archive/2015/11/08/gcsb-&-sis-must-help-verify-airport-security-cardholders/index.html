<p><strong>GCSB &amp; SIS MUST HELP VERIFY AIRPORT SECURITY CARDHOLDERS</strong></p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters<br>New Zealand First Leader<br>Member of Parliament for Northland</p>
<p>8 NOVEMBER 2015</p>
<p>Security services at New Zealand airports must re-verify all airport security cardholders as UK investigators focus on airport ground staff in Egypt after last week’s crash.</p>
<p>“We have seen the police act on open ISIS supporter, Wiremu Curtis, aka Harun Abdul-Majeed SaifuAllah. Given his passport was cancelled under existing law, it proves what a farce this government’s ‘foreign fighters bill’ was,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“But what of the people that don’t post on Facebook, as he did, but who hold similar views? What if those people have come here through the chasm that is unchecked immigration, or simply lied about their real identity to gain entry into New Zealand?</p>
<p>“This security risk is spelt out by GCSB/SIS concerns including unchecked immigration, which New Zealand First has long warned about. Seven years ago, we saw an attempted hijacking by Asha Ali Abdille, a person we’d also warned about.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First is asking the government to instruct SIS and GCSB to work with the Civil Aviation Authority and Avsec to re-verify all airport ID cardholders.</p>
<p>“This is especially urgent since the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, now believes a bomb is more likely than not, to have been involved in the Russian Flight 9268 disaster in Egypt. Our focus ought to be on checking the bona fides of the thousands of airport staff.</p>
<p>“Yet, when we raised it in Parliament, a cocksure Minister Finlayson claimed such an outrage would never happen here. We’re not so convinced and nor should Kiwis with well over 1,000 migrants arriving here every week,” says Mr Peters.</p>
