<p><strong>Millions of hours owed in annual leave compromising patient care</strong></p>
<p>Annette KING<br>Deputy Leader<br>Health Spokesperson</p>
<p>8 November 2015</p>
<p>Health workers, struggling with heavy workloads and under pressure to do more with less, are owed almost $500 million in overdue annual leave, Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“Figures released to Labour under the official Information Act show staff at the country’s 20 DHBs are owed $465 million in annual leave and millions of hours of backed up holidays.</p>
<p>“We know the health sector is under the gun. DHBs around the country are struggling to make ends meet as demand outstrips funding and face growing population cost pressures.</p>
<p>“At least 10 are already looking at budget blow-outs and we’re only in to the second month of the new financial year.</p>
<p>“Staff at the three Auckland DHBs have the most unused annual leave, with $177million owed in untaken holiday pay, while Canterbury DHB staff have than a million hours ($53.8 million) backed up. More than half the staff at MidCentral have more than four weeks unused leave.</p>
<p>“Our health professionals work incredibly hard, often forgoing overtime and meal breaks or working when they are sick to support their colleagues.</p>
<p>“These latest figures reinforce that. This is the hidden picture Jonathan Coleman doesn’t want us to know about and it should concern everyone.</p>
<p>“If frontline health staff are not taking annual leave, which they are entitled to, then they will be stressed and tired, and that is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>“Not only is patient care compromised, but lives could be put at risk.</p>
<p>“The National Government has underfunded the sector by $1.7 billion over the last six years. The workforce is carrying the burden of that and the impact is being felt across the country.”</p>
