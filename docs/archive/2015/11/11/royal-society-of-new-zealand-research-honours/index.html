<p>11 November 2015</p>
<p>Six University of Auckland researchers were awarded top honours in this year’s awards list from the Royal Society of New Zealand (RSNZ) and the Health Research Council of New Zealand (HRC) at a research honours dinner in Auckland last night (10 November 2015). They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distinguished Professor Ian Reid</strong> FRSNZ (Medicine) who was awarded the Rutherford Medal for his seminal contributions to the understanding and treatment of metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis and Paget’s Disease. This medal is the highest honour awarded by the RSNZ and acknowledges a lifetime of significant scholarly research. Distinguished Professor Reid was also awarded the Health Research Council of New Zealand (HRC) Liley Medal for his outstanding contribution to health and medical sciences in advancing treatment of the bone disorder osteoporosis.</li>
<li><strong>Professor Margaret Hyland</strong> (Chemical and Materials Engineering) received the Pickering Medal for her pioneering work into the reduction of fluoride emissions produced by aluminium smelters worldwide;</li>
<li><strong>Professor Keith Petrie</strong> FRSNZ (Psychological Medicine) was awarded  the Mason Durie Medal for his eminent research on patients’ perceptions of illness, how these affect recovery, and how they can be used to improve patients’ health outcomes;</li>
<li><strong>Professor Margaret Mutu</strong> (Māori Studies) received the Pou Aronui Award for her sustained contributions to indigenous rights and scholarship in New Zealand;</li>
<li><strong>Dr Michelle Dickinson</strong> (Chemical and Materials Engineering) received the Callaghan Medal for her passion and dedication to raising public awareness of the value of science in New Zealand, particularly with young people;</li>
<li><strong>Professor Ed Mitchell</strong> (Paediatrics:Child and Youth Health) was awarded the HRC Beaven Medal for his research into preventing cot death or sudden death infant syndrome.</li>
</ul>
<p>University of Auckland Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon says the awards demonstrate the excellence of research being carried out at the University. “We are proud of our academics, who consistently produce outstanding research work that attracts national and international recognition, and changes people’s lives,” he said.</p>
<p>Rutherford Medal winner, Distinguished Professor Ian Reid performed the first successful trial of bisphosphonates, drugs which slow or stop the natural process that dissolves bone tissue and which now can result in a 50 percent reduction in fracture risk in those with osteoporosis. Subsequent trials have increased their potency, requiring the drugs to be taken only yearly or once every five years.</p>
<p>Professor Reid has led the development of the use of potent bisphosphonates in Paget’s disease, a chronic and debilitating bone condition that has affected up to seven percent of older New Zealanders. Fewer than one percent of patients treated with the potent drugs relapse after a single infusion, making this the first-line therapy for Paget’s disease internationally.</p>
<p>His pioneering research has earned him numerous national and international awards.</p>
<p>Professor Margaret Hyland has made fundamental discoveries of the sources and mechanisms of gaseous and particulate emissions from aluminium smelters and has developed methods to cost-effectively reduce them..</p>
<p>Professor Hyland and her research team developed new technologies that are now used by the aluminium industry around the world to cost-effectively reduce gaseous and particulate emissions from aluminium smelting including fluorides.</p>
<p>Professor Petrie has found that how patients think about illness and their emotions has an impact on recovery and immune function in a range of different diseases. His research crosses the boundaries of health, medicine and psychology, and has brought the importance of patient perspectives more to the forefront in clinical medicine.</p>
<p>Among his findings, he has demonstrated how patients’ perceptions of a heart attack predicted recovery and return to work better than medical indicators of illness severity. His research on how expression or suppression of emotions influences immune function has also been widely recognised. He has recently demonstrated how a person’s positive and negative expectations can influence drug effectiveness and side effects.</p>
<p>Professor Margaret Mutu is esteemed nationally and internationally for her indigenous research and work on indigenous rights over three decades. In addition to her wide-ranging research, she has authored books, articles and book chapters on related issues, and she has played a role in nurturing Māori research through formally and informally mentoring emerging Māori scholars across New Zealand.</p>
<p>Her current work explores Māori claimants’ perspectives and experiences of Treaty of Waitangi settlements and she says it is a huge privilege to carry out the wishes of her Ngāti Kahu, Te Rarawa and Ngāti Whātua elders.</p>
<p>Dr Dickinson’s vision is to make science more accessible for everyone, particularly those who come from low-decile schools and rural communities. She promotes the value of science and technology to young people and tries to break down barriers that can stop them pursuing science, engineering and technology as a career.</p>
<p>Among her many imaginative initiatives, her alter ego “Nanogirl” campaigns to break stereotypes about what a scientist or engineer looks like, while her sponsorship of a new award category for girls in the national BrightSparks competition has resulted in a five-fold increase in the number of female applicants this year compared with last.</p>
<p>Professor Ed Mitchell’s research has helped save 3000 New Zealand babies’ lives to date with many thousands more around the world. He has made major contributions in other fields including asthma, childhood obesity, child health and development, Māori and Pacific health, intrauterine growth restriction, and most recently stillbirth.</p>
<p>He has led groundbreaking research which has refined knowledge about the causes of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS, formerly known as cot death) with the result that the number of New Zealand deaths from SIDS has dropped from 250 babies each year some 30 years ago to a current rate of about 40 per year. His current research is focused on reducing this figure even further to about six deaths per year.</p>
