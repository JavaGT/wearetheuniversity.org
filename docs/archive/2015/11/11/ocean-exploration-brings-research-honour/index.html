<p>Ocean exploration brings research honour</p>
<p>The scientific contribution of Professor Lionel Carter from Victoria University of Wellington’s Antarctic Research Centre has been recognised with the presentation of the 2015 Hutton Medal.</p>
<p>Awarded annually by the Royal Society of New Zealand, the medal recognises outstanding research in earth, plant and animal sciences.</p>
<p>Professor Carter investigates geological and oceanic processes, which includes deciphering marine geological records to assess changes in ocean environments. His work has demonstrated the roles of plate tectonics, ocean currents, sea levels and climate change in shaping New Zealand’s submarine continental landmass.</p>
<p>Lionel4Of particular note, Professor Carter identified the mechanisms whereby sediment from New Zealand rivers is discharged into the ocean and transported up to 4,500 kilometres, to be dragged into converging tectonic plates and ultimately recycled to the surface via volcanic activity.</p>
<p>He has contributed to identifying indicators in sediment to measure environmental change, as well as scientific models to predict environmental responses to climate warming.</p>
<p>Recent work includes participation in ANDRILL: a drilling programme in Antarctica to identify the effect of a changing Ross Ice Shelf on ocean circulation and water mass.</p>
<p>His research has had direct commercial application through a range of marine engineering projects. One example is Professor Carter’s involvement with the International Cable Protection Committee to better protect the global fibre-optic cable network from marine hazards. The network is responsible for around 95 per cent of all international internet and communications traffic.</p>
<p>“I am deeply honoured to receive the Hutton Medal for 2015,” says Professor Carter. “But it is an honour to be shared. Research into environmental change is a team effort involving experts in geology, oceanography, climatology and computer modelling, to name but a few.</p>
<p>“I have been fortunate to have been part of such teams, the latest being the highly talented group from the Antarctic Research Centre of Victoria University.”</p>
<p>The Hutton Medal adds to Professor Carter’s other honours, including being made a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 2003 and receiving the Marsden Medal for outstanding service to Science in 2012.</p>
