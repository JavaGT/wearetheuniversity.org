<p>No Plan B for Southern Response</p>
<p>Gerry Brownlee has no Plan B for cost overruns in Southern Response’s repair programme, says Labour’s Canterbury Issues spokesperson Megan Woods.</p>
<p>“Earlier this year, Southern Response warned their balance sheet was being put at risk by higher than expected numbers of properties being declared over-cap by EQC.</p>
<p>“Today at Select Committee we heard that Minister Brownlee has sought no meetings, written no correspondence and taken no action to decide how Southern Response will be funded to complete claims if the number of over-cap repairs is higher than expected.</p>
<p>“In fact, Southern Response’s only indication money might be available was something they’d seen Bill English say in the media.</p>
<p>“Once again, it looks like Gerry Brownlee is asleep at the wheel. After all the botch ups we’ve seen from EQC, there won’t be that many Cantabrians who would trust them to get their scoping right this time.</p>
<p>“Brownlee should meet with Southern Response and EQC urgently to make sure the funds will be available to get repairs done on time and to a good standard.</p>
<p>“We only get one chance to rebuild Canterbury and let people get on with their lives – we have to get it right the first time. Failing to plan is planning to fail,” says Megan Woods.</p>
