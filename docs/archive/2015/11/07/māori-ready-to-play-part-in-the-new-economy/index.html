<p><strong>Māori ready to play part in the new economy</strong></p>
<p>7 November 2015</p>
<p>The Māori economy will be a big driver of work changes and must be in a strong position to reap the benefits of new opportunities, Labour’ Chair of the Future of Work Commission Grant Robertson says.</p>
<p>Mr Robertson and Māori Development spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta today released three papers written by independent experts on the Māori Economy, Waikato-Tainui’s skill development partnerships and a South Auckland case study, as part of the Future of Work programme.</p>
<p>“The Māori economy is now worth $39 billion. It has a young workforce and a long-term inter-generational approach. Access to Treaty settlements capital puts Māori in an excellent position to benefit from the changes to the workforce over coming years,” says Mr Robertson.</p>
<p>“To make sure the full potential of these opportunities are seized there should be a new combined approach from the Government, Iwi Māori and the private sector to build high-value exports, and better skills, jobs and wages,” he says.</p>
<p>“Education, innovation and investment must all be harnessed properly. The regions must work in step with the heart of the Māori workforce – in South Auckland,” says Nanaia Mahuta.</p>
<p>“The challenges that lie ahead include transitioning the Māori economy towards a high-value sustainable future, the potential for new education and research collaborations between government and iwi, and harnessing the latent potential of young people in Auckland,” she says.</p>
