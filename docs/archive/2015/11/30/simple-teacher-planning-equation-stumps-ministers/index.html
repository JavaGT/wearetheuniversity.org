<p><strong>Simple Teacher Planning Equation Stumps Ministers</strong></p>
<p>The shortage of teachers in key subjects shows the government’s hands-off approach to education workforce planning isn’t working,” says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“Only a handful of maths and physics teachers graduate from New Zealand teacher training institutions each year and most of those are snapped up before they finish training,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
<p>“Many schools have to look overseas to fill key teacher positions.</p>
<p>“Why is the government burying its head in the sand and refusing to address this problem through simple planning?</p>
<p>“The government has failed to put measures in place to ensure schools can recruit high quality, New Zealand trained teachers in these subject areas.</p>
<p>“Minister of Tertiary Education Steven Joyce and Minister of Education Hekia Parata should do more to provide incentives for graduates to go into teaching.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First would prefer full government scholarships to train teachers in these subjects with a requirement to complete one year of teacher training upon graduation. This would be coupled with a dollar for dollar student loan write-off for teachers who stay and teach in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“That way, New Zealanders can give back to New Zealand by working with New Zealand students in New Zealand secondary schools.</p>
<p>“It’s not a difficult equation to work out but the problem won’t fix itself without simple workforce planning and incentives that will benefit teacher trainees, schools and ultimately students,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
