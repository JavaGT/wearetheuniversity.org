<p>03 November 2015</p>
<p>A pioneer of marine conservation and tireless campaigner in the battle to create New Zealand’s first marine reserves has died aged 78.</p>
<p>Dr Bill Ballantine played a central role in the establishment of New Zealand’s first ‘no take’ marine reserve at Leigh, north of Auckland. Today the reserve is one of the most popular diving spots in the country, renowned for the variety and abundance of its marine life.</p>
<p>At the time of its creation in 1977, it was thought to be the first ‘no take’ marine reserve of its type in the world.</p>
<p>“The Leigh Marine Reserve forms a lasting tribute to the dedication of Bill and his colleagues,” said University of Auckland Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon.</p>
<p>Dr Ballantine was the first and longest-serving Director of the University of Auckland’s Leigh Marine Laboratory. Current Head of the University’s Institute of Marine Science Professor Simon Thrush said New Zealand had lost a true conservation champion.</p>
<p>“We can all be grateful that Bill had the vision and the courage to fight as hard as he did to get greater protection for our marine environment, protection that has only proved more valuable as time has gone on,” Professor Thrush said.</p>
<p>University of Auckland Institute of Marine Science Associate Professor Mark Costello said Dr Ballantine was delighted with the recent announcement of the Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary at the Kermadec Islands northeast of New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Bill remained totally dedicated and engaged with marine conservation throughout his life. He was a great mentor and a dear friend to many colleagues and students here at Leigh and we will miss him greatly.”</p>
<p>Just this year, Dr Costello co-authored a research paper with Dr Ballantine which examined the global effort to protect the world’s oceans from over-fishing and biodiversity loss and which found that more needed to be done.</p>
<p>Dr Ballantine was a strong advocate of no-take reserves and he believed that only areas that imposed a ban on fishing had real conservation benefit.</p>
<p>“He was a champion of our marine species and even in retirement, he never stopped campaigning for further protection of our marine environment,” Dr Costello said.</p>
