<p>Northland Firm Misses Out on College Rebuilding Project</p>
<p>New Zealand First is concerned that local firms have missed out on the rebuilding of Northland College.</p>
<p>“While the government refused to comment when asked in Parliament today, a major building firm in Kaikohe has been told it got no further than an expression of interest,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Given that the company has a solid record, a master builder’s award, and currently is undertaking a major contract, we have to ask why they would not have made the short list.</p>
<p>“They were not even given an explanation.</p>
<p>“There was a dire need for Northland College’s ghetto-like buildings to be replaced, and it was essential that the work was distributed to Northland firms, particularly in Kaikohe which has high unemployment and a continued decline in economic activity.</p>
<p>“It is not good enough for Minister of Education Hekia Parata to say in Parliament that a Minister must be hands off during the procurement process. The point is that a key consideration in deciding the winning tender should have been local benefit. The government has responsibility for the procurement policy.</p>
<p>“It’s common sense that awarding the project to a local contractor would give the local economy a huge boost,” says Mr Peters.</p>
