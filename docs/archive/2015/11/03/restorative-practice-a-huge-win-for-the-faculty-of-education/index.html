<p><strong>Restorative practice a huge win for the Faculty of Education</strong></p>

<p>The Institute of Professional Learning: Te Whai Toi Tangata and Te Kura Toi Tangata Faculty of Education at the University of Waikato was recently awarded a major national contract to introduce and support Positive Behaviour for Learning (PB4L) Restorative Practice into 200 secondary schools in New Zealand over the next three years.</p>
<p>Staff in the Faculty have a long history of teaching, research and support in the development of restorative practice in schools, and the Institute has a substantial record of working with schools on professional learning projects spanning more than 25 years.</p>
<p>“This contract recognises that this is a great combination of our different skills and knowledge,” says IPL Director and Associate Dean Professional Learning, Jan Martin.</p>
<p>Restorative justice has had a high profile in the media, and it is now well embedded in the New Zealand justice system. What is less well known, is that many schools in Aotearoa New Zealand have already put a lot of effort into learning to use the practices in classrooms and playgrounds, as well as with the more serious side of school discipline and student behaviour.</p>
<p>It is well accepted around the world that schools that commit to a “restorative culture” develop calm, happy, teaching and learning environments.</p>

<p>Co-director of the project Associate Professor Wendy Drewery commented that the Ministry has committed significant funding for the project. She is excited that the Ministry wants to join with the team in partnership, to support schools to develop their relationship practices using a restorative lens.</p>
<p>“It is a major commitment to developing skills of peaceful citizenship among our young people,” she says. “It dovetails well with another current Ministry focus, that of student well-being.”</p>
<p>The contract is the culmination of work by a substantial team of people including the Institute Manager Tammy Tauroa. The Institute has a number of office bases across the country including at Innovation Park, Ruakura, which will be the new home to a team of expert practitioners who will live and work in regions all around the country.</p>
