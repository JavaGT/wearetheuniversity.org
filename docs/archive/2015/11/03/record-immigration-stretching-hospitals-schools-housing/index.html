<p>Record Immigration Stretching Hospitals, Schools, Housing</p>
<p>The Prime Minister is unconcerned that Kiwis face overstretched health services as rapid population growth overloads underfunded public services, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“The serious impact of over a thousand people arriving each week to settle in New Zealand was fobbed off by the PM in Parliament today,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“The PM could only talk about ‘diversity’ of the record 61,200 migrants arriving in the past year. He was incapable of addressing the fact that infrastructure is overloaded including, health, police, housing and education.</p>
<p>“With Statistics NZ stating that half the migrants are settling in Auckland, it’s little wonder there is a crisis with too much demand and a shortage of homes.</p>
<p>“At the same time, figures show that district health boards are under growing financial pressure as they struggle to deal with more and more people queuing for medical services.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is under strain from the lack of the National government’s foresight and failure to balance immigration with adequate funding of public services. New Zealanders are paying the price as they now queue for services funded by their taxes.”</p>
