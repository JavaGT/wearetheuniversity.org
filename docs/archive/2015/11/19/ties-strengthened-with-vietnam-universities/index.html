<p><strong>Ties strengthened with Vietnam universities</strong></p>
<p>The University of Waikato has further strengthened international links by signing two MOUs with partners in Vietnam this week.</p>
<p>The university’s Chancellor, Rt Hon James Bolger, went to Vietnam as part of a New Zealand delegation that included Prime Minister John Key, Minister for Tertiary Education Steven Joyce and delegates from Education New Zealand and other New Zealand universities, to explore educational collaboration with organisations in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Mr Bolger signed agreements with Vietnam International Education Development (VIED) or the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) and the University of Economics, Ho Chi Minh City (UEH).</p>
<p>The partnership with VIED will allow high-quality scholarship students to study at the University of Waikato under a Waikato-VIED scholarship programme. The partnership with the University of Economics, Ho Chi Minh City, is an exciting opportunity which will provide opportunities for students to study in both UEH and Waikato at undergraduate and postgraduate levels.</p>
<p>While in Vietnam, Mr Bolger also took part in a panel discussion on educational reform in New Zealand, spoke to representatives of the Foreign Trade University and addressed students of the Australian International School on the benefits of university study in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“We know how important international connections are – especially in a small country like New Zealand,” Mr Bolger says. The former New Zealand Prime Minister opened the first embassy in Vietnam in 1995.</p>
<p>“The University of Waikato is proud to be partnering with VIED and the UEH, Ho Chi Minh City. Both partnerships are proof of our commitment to sharing and gaining expertise on a global level,” he says.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato has made available scholarships for Vietnamese students to study at an undergraduate, masters and higher degree research level.</p>
