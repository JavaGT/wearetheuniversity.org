<p><strong>Broken promise leaves schools chasing truants</strong></p>
<p>The Government’s broken promise to provide extra funding to tackle truants has left schools picking up the tab for chasing absent students, Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>“National promised in 2008 it would give schools an additional $4 million a year to reduce truancy.</p>
<p>“However, schools haven’t seen a cent of that money.</p>
<p>“Despite its much-heralded new truancy service, the frequent truant rate has increased by a massive 30 per cent over the past year.</p>
<p>“A recent PISA survey found New Zealand stood out as having one of the strongest links between skipping school and maths achievement.</p>
<p>“National also promised to crack down on truants by prosecuting more parents. Yet fewer parents have been prosecuted under this Government than the former Labour government.</p>
<p>“These broken promises follow another to increase frontline education staff.</p>
<p>“Hekia Parata today tried to suggest National’s truancy policy is all going to plan when it is clearly a failure. The Minister is AWOL herself – she is in la la land,” Chris Hipkins says.</p>
