<p><strong>‘It’s our future’ say Aoraki students</strong></p>
<p>19 November 2015</p>
<p>Media Release: New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations</p>
<p>The newly announced CPIT-Aoraki polytechnic has been put on notice. Students and staff held a rally today at Aoraki’s Timaru campus to launch a community campaign around the merger taking place between the two institutions.</p>
<p>National student President Rory McCourt spent the day meeting with students who said they wanted their values reflected in the new institution.</p>
<p>Joe Smith, a first-year Art student said that at Aoraki the tutors really cared, and caring staff had to be part of the future for students in South Canterbury.</p>
<p>Of the tutors Joe said “They find ways to get the information into your head. Often they know what’s going on for you before you’ve said it, or even know yourself.”</p>
<p>Many other students said caring staff should be at the heart of the new institution. Malcolm, a mature-age carpentry student studying at Aoraki through CPIT, said that “aroha” was the most important thing, and opportunities had to exist for the next generation in the regions.</p>
<p>Student Ethan Jaycock, who had recently moved from nearby Temuka to Timaru, said the future is in stable and secure learning.</p>
<p>“Students have got to know that their courses will continue. I’ll be pretty upset if they start chopping and changing our courses. It&#39;s our future that&#39;s at stake” he said.</p>
<p>All students agreed that the future was in local, face-to-face provision.</p>
<p>Mr McCourt told the rally that the purpose of the campaign was to put the new institution on notice.</p>

<p>“The future won’t be decided in Christchurch. The future will be decided here, by the staff and the students and the community” he said.</p>
<p>“Our message to CPIT-Aoraki is simple: We’re here, we’re watching and we’re not going anywhere. If they try to cut a course here, or cut provision there, -we’ll be watching. And we won’t let them get away with it.”</p>
<p>Mr McCourt warned that, with the economic future of South Canterbury looking bright, it was important the new institution did not risk that opportunity with shoddy online replacement of essential courses.</p>
<p>“They’ve got to back local provision and local jobs. That’s the what a good future for students here looks like.”</p>
<p>Mr McCourt spoke at the midday rally alongside Tertiary Education Union National President Sandra Grey and TEU Branch President Carol Soal.</p>
<p>Carpentry students performed an impromptu haka for Ms Soal, honouring her for her advocacy for Aoraki staff and students.</p>
<p>This was Mr McCourt’s third visit to meet with students about the merger.</p>
