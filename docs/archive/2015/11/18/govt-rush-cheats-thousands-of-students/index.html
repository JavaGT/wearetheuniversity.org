<p><strong>Govt rush cheats thousands of students</strong></p>
<p>18 November 2015</p>
<p>Media Release: New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations<br>The national student union is encouraging students who may have been shortchanged by the way the Government implemented the Social Security Act to file today to claim back any money owed before legislation is passed retrospectively changing the law.</p>
<p>National student president Rory McCourt says most students and graduates will not realise they are eligible before it is too late. He says between five and twenty thousand students per year since 1998 could be entitled.</p>
<p>“The Government’s mishandling of this Act affected not only beneficiaries but also thousands of Kiwis who have been students. Students who were shortchanged by the Government should make a claim and see what they’re entitled to before the law changes.&quot;</p>
<p>“It’s an important principle that the state adheres to the law. When the state breaks the law, it should act justly to make amends. It should not post facto make its actions legal. Claiming back even a small sum is a statement that the citizen is afforded rights according to the law, not politicians&#39; whims.”</p>
<p>&quot;By rushing this legislation through with no grace period for claims, the Government is cheating thousands of students out of their own money. That&#39;s terrible law making. We hope a grace period will be added via amendment before this retrospective face-saver is rammed through.&quot;</p>
<p>Students who received the Unemployment Benefit Student Hardship (UBSH) since 1998, or the renamed Jobseeker Support Student Hardship, could be eligible. The backpay comes as a result of Work and Income standing down students and beneficiaries for a day longer than the Act specified. Claimants could receive backpay for each and every time they applied.</p>

<p>Affected students could receive between $25 and $30 for each time they made a successful application, depending on their age at the time. Those with dependent children at the time could receive up to $40 for each application.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to fill out a short form on winzoweme.com and submit their request to the Ministry of Social Development before legislation is rushed through under urgency, likely today.</p>
<p>The current eligibility for the Jobseeker Support Student Hardship is only for those:</p>
<p>•18 years old or over – some 16 and 17 year olds can get it<br>•registered for work with Student Job Search or Work and Income<br>•actively looking for full-time work<br>•in full-time study before your break and planning to return to study<br>•a New Zealand citizen, or meet residency requirements.</p>
<p>You usually have to have:<br>•no other means of supporting yourself<br>•little or no income<br>•cash assets under $4,300 if you are single, or $7,464 if you have a partner or child.<br>ENDS</p>
