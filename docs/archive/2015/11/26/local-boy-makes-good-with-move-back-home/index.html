<p><strong>Thursday, 26 November 2015, 10:25 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato">University of Waikato</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Local boy makes good with move back home</strong></p>
<p>Pat Mellsop will be a familiar face to many in the Waikato.</p>
<p>Raised in Hamilton and a Waikato graduate, Mr Mellsop is the University of Waikato’s newly-appointed associate director of external engagement, responsible for coordinating the university’s externally-focused programmes, which include employer engagement, development and fundraising and alumni relations.</p>
<p><strong>A background in the sports industry</strong><br>A post-graduation career that began innocuously enough in retail, Mr Mellsop was head of marketing at the Waikato Rugby Union and Chiefs Super Rugby franchise for 12 years, and prior to that was the first regional sports coordinator for Sport Waikato, responsible for rolling out the region’s school sports programmes.</p>
<p>Before joining the University of Waikato he was commercial director for Kent Country Cricket Club in the UK for five years.</p>
<p>“Mr Mellsop will be an incredible asset to the university,” says Vice-Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley. “His experience in external engagement and relationship-building is well above par, and the added benefit of him being a Waikato local means he’s been able to hit the ground running.”</p>
<p>“The university has a renewed commitment to engaging external audiences – locally and internationally – and Mr Mellsop is the best person to help us do this, and do it well,” says Professor Quigley.</p>
<p><strong>Glad to be home</strong><br>Mr Mellsop says he’s proud to be back on his home turf.</p>

<p>“I followed the university while I was overseas, and I was particularly pleased to see how far it rose in the world rankings this year.</p>
<p>“We really are world-class, and working overseas has really solidified my thoughts about Waikato – in particular the university. We have amazing things to offer our community – whether that’s through using our campus facilities, utilising academic expertise or just heading along to one of our public events,” says Mr Mellsop.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting the people</strong><br>He says first on his to-do list is getting out and about in the community.</p>
<p>“Right now I’m focusing on meeting people and getting a sense of what they’re thinking and the types of things they’d like to see the university doing.</p>
<p>“It’s a really exciting time for us with the enhanced focus on our community. The university is a wonderful community resource and I’m looking forward to help expand its offerings.”</p>
