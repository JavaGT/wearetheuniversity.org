<p><strong>Thursday, 26 November 2015, 10:13 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>UC appoints new Distinguished Professor</strong></p>
<p>**<br>For immediate release**</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury has elevated one of New Zealand’s top science communicators and pre-eminent marine scientists to the rank of Distinguished Professor.</p>
<p>Marine ecologist Professor David Schiel, of the UC’s School of Biological Science, has been promoted to the status of Distinguished Professor, a title reserved for professors who demonstrate world-class academic leadership, as well as achievements of the highest international standing over a decade or more.</p>
<p>Prof Schiel has made outstanding contributions in teaching, research, and service as well as significant contributions to science, industry and the wider community in his 26-year association with UC, including acting as one of the main science commentators following the grounding of the MV Rena and subsequent oil spill off Tauranga on 5 October 2011, reporting on the environmental clean-up and long-term consequences.</p>
<p>Prof Schiel says he is greatly honoured to receive this recognition from the University of Canterbury.</p>
<p>“None of us can achieve our aspirations in research and teaching without the support of our colleagues in the University and across many collaborations. I am grateful to my students and research associates in the Marine Ecology Research Group and the School of Biological Sciences, the University that has supported me for much of my career, my colleagues at NIWA, and my international associates, particularly at Oregon State University and Moss Landing Marine Lab,” Prof Schiel says.</p>

<p>“Marine ecological research has risen to the forefront of national and international science as we grapple with achieving sustainable use of our ocean resources. It is pleasing that we have been able to play a useful role in that science, train many students to face a changing world, and mentor those who will be tomorrow’s leaders. I have no doubts that the University of Canterbury will continue to be a leading institution in those endeavours.”</p>
<p>The pre-eminent marine scientist, whose research includes marine intertidal and sub-tidal ecology and aquaculture, was recently named New Zealand Science Communicator of the Year and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 2014, the first year he was nominated.</p>
<p>Research highlights include 140 refereed publications, including journals such as Nature and Science, and top journals in marine ecology. Prof Schiel has more than 4100 citations to his name and recently published his magnum opus The Biology and Ecology of Giant Kelp Forests (University of California Press, 2015, with co-author Michael Foster), which has been described by reviewers as a book that “will have a lasting impact” and “the seminal work on kelp forest ecosystems”.</p>
<p>Prof Steve Weaver, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research), says that Prof Schiel has made outstanding contributions that have built his reputation as a leading marine scientist in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Professor Schiel’s work is research-led but his Distinguished Professorship recognises his all-round performance, including his teaching and his service to marine industries as well as to the community. As an academic, he has made an outstanding contribution right across the board,” Prof Weaver says.</p>
<p>As a world expert on kelp forests and temperate reefs, he has attracted more than $14.5 million in external research funding to UC, including three Marsden research grants. Prof Schiel also established the Kaikoura Field Station as a marine laboratory of note, and worked with the marine aquaculture industry, in particular the blue pearl industry, paua/abalone and other marine farming.</p>
<p>Known as a student-oriented teacher, he has supervised large numbers of postgraduates, PhD and Masters students, as well as leading the Marine Ecology Research Group and the Centre of Excellence in Aquaculture and Marine Ecology.</p>
<p>In announcing Prof Schiel’s appointment, Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr noted that this is the fifth Distinguished Professor to be appointed since promotions to the rank began in 2013 at UC.</p>
<p>“He joins UC’s Distinguished Professors Jack Copeland, who researches the philosophy of computing and cognitive science, Niki Davis, an expert in e-learning, Mike Steel, a mathematician who researches how life on Earth began, and Geoff Chase, a mechatronics engineer at the forefront of medical decision support research,” Dr Carr says.</p>
