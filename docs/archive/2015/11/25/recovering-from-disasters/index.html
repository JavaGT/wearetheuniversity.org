<p>25 November 2015</p>
<p>Earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, fires and wars: major disasters occur around the world each year but recovering from them takes many years and vast resources.</p>
<p>Five years after Canterbury was first shaken by a major quake, Christchurch still faces years of rebuilding. Australian communities affected by the devastating bush fires in February 2009 are still trying to rebuild their communities.    </p>
<p>Professor Suzanne Wilkinson from the University of Auckland is a leading disaster recovery and reconstruction researcher who will give her inaugural lecture on disaster recovery and the complexity of the problems faced by different groups.</p>
<p>This free public lecture will focus on the significant role the construction industry plays in how communities recover from disasters and discuss how they can recover well.</p>
<p>She will also discuss future earthquake research including how best to help communities rebuild and how better buildings and better planning can help communities become stronger than they were pre-disaster.</p>
<p>Based within the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Professor Wilkinson has been a lead researcher on the Christchurch earthquake recovery programme through projects with BRANZ, EQC and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.</p>
<p>Her research has been assisting the Government to understand how to improve recovery as it proceeds, including managing shortages of builders and engineers and shortages of materials to build with.</p>
<p>Her lecture also includes a look at what would happen if Auckland suffered a significant disaster event and how the lessons learned from Christchurch could be applied during future events.</p>
<p>Professor Wilkinson leads the Bush Fire Recovery Project, a longitudinal study of recovery and reconstruction following the 2009 Australian bush fires.</p>
<p>This public lecture will be held on Wednesday 2 December 2015 from 5pm to 6pm at the Faculty of Engineering, 20 Symonds St, Auckland in lecture theatre 423.342.</p>
