<p><strong>Review timely but ineffective without funding</strong></p>
<p>A review of education law is timely but the Government must ensure it is a genuine examination of New Zealand’s education system and the future needs of schools, Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>“Since the Education Act came into effect 26 years ago a lot has changed for teachers, students and school communities.</p>
<p>“Schools need more support to deliver the national curriculum. The support they receive from the Ministry of Education has been diminishing.</p>
<p>“Taking funding structures off the table will only ensure this review is a whitewash.</p>
<p>“When National came to office they promised to increase frontline staff. However the opposite is happening.</p>
<p>“New figures obtained by Labour show frontline staff have fallen from 43.6 per cent in 2009/10 to 40.5 per cent in 2013/14. Over the same period the number of back office staff rose from 56.5 per cent to 59.5 per cent.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile the Ministry has increased its spending on public relations staff by almost 200 per cent since to $2.5 million.</p>
<p>“This review comes as Hekia Parata publicly muses about linking school funding to student achievement. However, she refuses to give any details about her plans.</p>
<p>“The Education Minister must include funding in this review or suspicion will remain she is making secret changes without the input of the school sector,” Chris Hipkins says.</p>
