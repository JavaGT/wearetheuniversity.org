<p>New Zealand and Tasmania join forces in agricultural research and education</p>
<p>12 November 2015</p>
<p>The agriculture and food sectors of Tasmania and New Zealand, which have much in common, are set to benefit from the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Lincoln University and the University of Tasmania. The MoU was signed as part of a three day Tasmanian Government-led delegation visit to Lincoln University.</p>
<p>The MoU formalises current research collaborations and paves the way for new research opportunities in dairy, vegetables, viticulture, apples, pasture production, and food safety and innovation.</p>
<p>Another key potential collaboration will be in education and training, including through joint training of postgraduate research students and joint exploration of new flexible pathways into agriculture studies at the University of Tasmania.</p>
<p>The agreement was co-signed by the Universities and witnessed by Dr John Hay, Interim Vice-Chancellor at Lincoln University, Tasmania&#39;s Deputy Premier and Minister for Primary Industries and Water, and Education, the Hon Jeremy Rockliff, and Prof Holger Meinke, Head of the School of Land and Food and Director of the Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture (TIA) at the University of Tasmania.</p>
<p>Lincoln University is ranked 13th in the Quacquarelli Symond (QS) World University rankings for universities with less than 5000 students. It is a specialist land-based university and is focused on improving New Zealand’s land-based knowledge, wealth and productivity.</p>

<p>Uniquely Lincoln also offer bridging programs for students who do not have university entry pre-requisites to accelerate them into degree-level study, which is emblematic of their commitment to increasing higher education graduates in their specialised fields.</p>
<p>&quot;Building collaborations between New Zealand and Tasmania through university connections and partnerships offers many potential opportunities for innovation and niche market growth to benefit agriculture and food systems on both sides of the Tasman Sea,&quot; University of Tasmania Vice-Chancellor Professor Rathjen said.</p>
<p>&quot;The MoU signals a commitment by both parties to expand research capability and education to build sustainable and profitable agriculture and food industries both in Tasmania and New Zealand,&quot; Professor Rathjen said.</p>
<p>&quot;As part of this we will also investigate synergies and potential collaboration on future delivery of associate degrees and explore opportunities to work together in the promotion of careers in agriculture.&quot;</p>
<p>Lincoln University Interim Vice-Chancellor, Dr John Hay, said the agreement offered unique opportunities for joint research and teaching of benefit to New Zealand, Tasmania and the world.</p>
<p>&quot;Through this MoU we will tackle complex research challenges, share knowledge and attract talented students and scientists that will cement both universities&#39; profiles as world-leading in agriculture education and research,&quot; Dr Hay said.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand&#39;s agriculture Industry has much in common with Tasmania in terms of size, climate, diversity and increasing emphasis on innovation, niche marketing and branding quality produce.</p>
<p>&quot;Working together we will link in to each other&#39;s relative strengths by sharing technological and research information that can help both Tasmania and New Zealand with new product development and diversification.&quot;</p>
<p>The wine industry could also benefit from collaboration between the two countries says Dr Roland Harrison, Director of Lincoln University’s Centre for Viticulture and Oenology, which hosted the delegation for part of their visit.</p>
<p>“We had some very useful discussions with the delegation from Tasmania. The wine industry in Tasmania, although smaller, has many similarities with the New Zealand industry, specifically in terms of grape varieties and a focus on high quality. There is much we can learn from each other, and I’m sure this visit will prompt further exchanges. It would be wonderful to carry out joint with Tasmanian colleagues, and I’m sure that students involved in these projects would benefit immensely.”</p>
