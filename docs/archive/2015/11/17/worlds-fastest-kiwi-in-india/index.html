<p><strong>World’s fastest Kiwi in India?</strong></p>
<p>He’s cycled the length of New Zealand and the width of Australia, and in February 2016, Tim Chittock will attempt to set a Guinness World Record for cycling the Indian Golden Quadrilateral.</p>
<p>To set a new world record, Tim will have to cycle 300km a day to make the distance within 20 days. He will travel between Chennai, Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhubaneswar, Jaipur, Kanpur, Pune, Surat, Guntur, Vijayawada, and Visakhapatnam. The record is measured in days, hours, minutes and seconds to the nearest 0.001 seconds.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old has just completed a Bachelor of Laws with a second major in Economics at the University of Waikato and says he was contacted by Guinness and asked if he’d like to give the record a shot.</p>
<p>“I thought it would be a good thing to do over the summer. My mum’s freaking out, but my dad’s ok with it. I’d really like to set a world record, but I’ve been warned the most difficult things about the trip could be being chased by dogs with rabies and avoiding getting sick. I’ve also heard the roads are terrible with lots of potholes and tons of traffic that’s out of control.”</p>
<p>Tim is planning on taking a lot of his own high-protein foods such as dried meats and milk powder, and plenty of lollies for instant energy.</p>
<p>He says the reason he loves these kinds of adventures is that even though at the time they’re hard going, there are highlights along the way.</p>
<p>“Some of it will be hell, but even small things such as having a shower, and seeing the dawn and dusk can be magic.”</p>

<p>In order to comply with Guinness requirements, Tim will have to keep a log book to record distance covered, and people he meets who can verify he’s been to each location. In each city he will have to meet up with a policeman or city official and get a photo of himself with a landmark. He will need to collect photographic evidence and at least 10 minutes of video footage day. The cities can be visited in any order and the entire route must be tracked on GPS.</p>
<p>Tim will begin his journey on February 18 from Delhi.</p>
