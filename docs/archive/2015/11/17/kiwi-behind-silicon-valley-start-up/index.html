<p>From Auckland, to Shazam, to Stanford University, the next challenge for a young kiwi engineer is launching her start-up venture in Silicon Valley.  </p>
<p>Priyanka Shekar studied Electrical and Electronics Engineering at the University of Auckland.   </p>
<p>She is a Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer at Californian based Grüv Music, an intuitive learning app which enables people to create music anywhere, anytime, with easy-to-play instruments and targeted and practical lessons.  </p>
<p>“The aim is to open the doors of music-making to everyone, regardless of ability or training,” Priyanka says.  </p>
<p>“We want to enable anyone to be able to pick up their smartphone and make music, and believe that musical creativity is innate.”  </p>
<p>Grüv Music was recently accepted into the StartX business accelerator, a launching pad for Stanford University’s top entrepreneurs.  </p>
<p>Priyanka dubs herself an ‘imagineer’ with a unique and virtuosic passion for blending engineering with music.  </p>
<p>“I’ve always loved technology like Sony&#39;s SingStar karaoke game and Smule&#39;s Magic Piano app, where the barriers to entry to making music are lowered by technology designed for easy mastery and participation,” she says.  </p>
<p>Priyanka completed a Master&#39;s in Music Technology at Stanford University in 2014 on a prestigious Denning Family Fellowship in Fine Arts, only three of which are awarded each year to graduates with creative excellence and interdisciplinary focus.  </p>
<p>Since then she has worked alongside Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, such as Ge Wang, who co-founded Smule, the leader in music creation for the mass market, and completed a three month internship at Shazam Entertainment in the San Francisco Bay Area.  </p>
<p>Along the way Priyanka has interned at Navman Technology, Beca and Eastland Network in New Zealand; and worked as an engineering consultant at Set Based Solutions and Aurecon in Auckland and Hong Kong.  </p>
<p>Priyanka says women engineers are a rare sight in the tech scene, and she is hoping she can influence other young women to enter the industry.  </p>
<p>“I actively support change and am involved in a number of initiatives which support women in technology fields, through women leadership programmes at Stanford, by mentoring others, and participating in events like Y Combinator’s Female Founder Conference.”  </p>
