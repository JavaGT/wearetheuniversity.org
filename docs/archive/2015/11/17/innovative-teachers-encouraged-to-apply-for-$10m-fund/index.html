<p>Innovative teachers encouraged to apply for $10m fund</p>
<p>National List MP based in the Hutt Valley Chris Bishop is encouraging Hutt Valley teachers and schools to apply for the second round of the $10 million Teacher-led Innovation Fund.</p>
<p>“Hutt Valley teachers make a real difference in the classroom. They are innovative and are helping create the next generation of scientists and entrepreneurs for “Technology Valley”. This fund will help bring their great ideas to life,” says Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>“Two Hutt Valley projects were successful recipient of first round funding in July. Maungaraki School and Sacred Heart Petone are leading 18 month and two-year collaborative projects respectively. They are both lighting the way for other applications to follow.”</p>
<p>The fund forms part of the Government’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative and focuses on new practices, and on applying existing practices in new contexts.</p>
<p>“The fund supports teaching teams to develop innovative practices that improve learning outcomes and lift student achievement. This is especially important for students who are Māori, Pasifika, have special education needs or come from low socio-economic backgrounds,” Mr Bishop says.</p>
<p>“I regularly visit schools in the Hutt Valley and see first-hand the leadership being demonstrated by our teachers. I am encouraging those teachers to take the next step and apply for this fund so that their practices can be modelled and shared with others.”</p>
<p>Applications close on 19 February 2016.
