<p>Aoraki shambles shuffling deckchairs</p>
<p>10 November 2015</p>
<p>Media Release: New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations<br>The national student union is doubtful the merger between Aoraki Polytechnic and CPIT will produce better outcomes for students.</p>
<p>National student president Rory McCourt says the merger process has been long, and proponents unclear about how it would turn around the two institutions&#39; fortunes in an underfunded sector.</p>
<p>“In the last seven years, our regional polytechnics have had very tough choices to make in the face of falling funding. Some have chosen to shift their focus to lucrative international students in Auckland, while others have stayed committed to their local rohe. Aoraki did the right thing, -it valued regional provision, and its reward has been disestablishment.”</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t pretend that this merger fixes the Government’s chronic underfunding of regional polytechnics. It doesn&#39;t change institutions shifting their focus to Auckland, or that student numbers are set to fall in the next few years. Our polytechs are up against the wall. This merger is only the start.&quot;</p>
<p>“For anyone looking at the long-term future of regional provision in this country, this merger is just shuffling deckchairs.”</p>
<p>Mr McCourt says the pressure will remain to cut costs.</p>
<p>“We’d be concerned if quality face-to-face provision is replaced by cheap online courses or ‘blended learning’. Regional provision is about getting locals the skills and knowledge they need, not about making money.”</p>
<p>“To be successful, this merger needs a strong, independent local student voice. It’s the only way to guard against rash cuts to provision.”</p>
<p>Mr McCourt says the Minister’s late decision gives Aoraki students only 10 days of term time left to prepare for the fact their institution won’t exist next year.</p>
<p>“It’s a joke that Steven Joyce expects this merger to go ahead on 1 January after faffing about for months on end. Staff and students need more notice than just six weeks. His management of this sector is becoming a shambles.”</p>
