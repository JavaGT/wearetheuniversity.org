<p>Time to give up on CBD?</p>
<p>A Lincoln University expert says new figures are making it clearer investing in more central business district (CBD) office space makes no financial sense for developers.</p>
<p>Associate Professor in Property Studies John McDonagh says CBD developers are effectively donating millions of dollars to the city.</p>
<p>“Considering the construction cost, rents and likelihood of no capital gains in the foreseeable future, they should be called philanthropists rather than developers.”<br>That is why few other developers or overseas investors are lining up to join the party – it does not make financial sense, he adds.</p>
<p>There have already been warnings of an oversupply of office space, a situation which Christchurch experienced before in the early 1990s and took 15 years to recover from. There were many developer casualties as a result.</p>
<p>The new figures released by Colliers late last month show what is under construction now will probably be all that is needed for a long time, he says, stalling further development.</p>
<p>Early developers also had the jump on the rest and have secured the best tenants, reducing the attractiveness of investing further.</p>
<p>“The four big ongoing developments in Cashel Street are pretty much all we will get in the CBD core,” Associate Professor McDonagh says.</p>
<p>He says “anchor” projects are also notable by their absence, and rather than leading and encouraging development may now deserve the alternative definition of “anchor” – in that, with all the procrastination they have held development back.</p>

<p>Leasing up of office space is steady but slowing, “and with other property coming on stream across the river to the west an oversupply of office space is looming”.<br>“This also does not take into account any fix ups of pre-earthquake buildings adding to supply. This oversupply will curtail any further development, and really start to hit suburban office space rents and vacancy levels.”</p>
<p>He says there is also still 30 hectares of vacant commercial land in the city available but with nothing planned for its future.</p>
<p>“Perhaps inner city residential is the solution, but this brings a whole raft of unanswered questions and risks.”</p>
