<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader</p>
<p>Member of Parliament for Northland<br>24 NOVEMBER 2015  </p>
<p><strong>Catastrophe in Making with Record Levels of Debt-Ridden Foreign Students</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand is facing a catastrophe from highly indebted students entering the country on student visas, warns New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“The absolute rush to get to New Zealand is evidenced in the massive 8300 applications made to the Immigration NZ India office in Mumbai in just two months prior to a new English language requirement,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First warned the National Government of the stupidity of extending work rights to foreign students.</p>
<p>“It opened up a pathway to residence and a flood of immigrants, one of the main drivers in immigration reaching a new record for the 15th consecutive month – 120,100 immigrants in the year to October and a record net gain of 62,500.</p>
<p>“Low-skilled jobs are being taken over by foreign students desperate to earn to pay off debt, and open to being exploited by employers. Their goal is not study.</p>
<p>“Immigration NZ is well aware that when Australia realised the so-called Export Education sector was an avenue for many to residency, they clamped down on student visas overnight.</p>
<p>“This trapped 35,000 international students as illegal overstayers. They were unable to go home because of the money owed.</p>
<p>“It’s time for swift action to stop the student-visa-for-residency scam, and protect migrants from saddling themselves and their families with debt.”</p>
