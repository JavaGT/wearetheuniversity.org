<p>Falsehoods, Ignorance, Head in the Sand on Emission Reductions</p>
<p>The government has its head in the sand on electric vehicles, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“National is blind to the glare of opportunity in the electric vehicle industry,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“It is refusing to concede that electric vehicles will reduce emissions, save New Zealand a fortune in oil imports and will protect our green image.</p>
<p>“In its ignorance it is denying electric vehicle entrepreneurs in New Zealand a vital lift to move ahead quickly.</p>
<p>“Climate Change Minister Tim Groser claimed today National does not do subsidies, just as Transport Minister Simon Bridges told the industry recently – ‘go it alone’.</p>
<p>“This is to blatantly ignore the positive alternatives.</p>
<p>“Mr Groser’s pearler was delivered unchallenged on TV One’s Q&amp;A programme this morning in discussions on the forthcoming Climate Change Conference in Paris.</p>
<p>“National has had no problem dishing out taxpayer money previously:</p>
<p>$67 million to Warner Bros</p>
<p>$30m to Rio Tinto</p>
<p>$800m to South Canterbury Finance</p>
<p>A sweet heart deal over TVNZ land, extra pokies and the new convention centre for SkyCity.</p>
<p>“New Zealand has hydro-electric generation on tap, as Norway does, and its forged ahead with its EV industry. Norway has over 70,000 electric vehicles already. In contrast, NZ only has about 800.</p>
<p>“All we need is a government to stop talking ideological platitudes and to start supporting practical policies,” says Mr Peters.</p>
