<p>Vending Machines For All</p>
<p><img src="http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1511/402ed2b3f79411d6d845.jpeg" alt="">  </p>
<p>A Waikato University law student is working on a summer start-up project to make vending machines more accessible to people living with disabilities or impairments.</p>
<p>Jayne Kaye Sankey-O’Dwyer went blind when she was 25 and had to make big changes in her life.</p>
<p>She says while there’s been big improvements in services for people with disabilities, accessibility to common services is still a big issue.</p>
<p>“One day I forgot to bring my drink bottle to university and embarrassingly had to ask a classmate to work the vending machine for me,” she says. “It’s not just me though, I was talking to a woman in a wheelchair who said she can’t use the machines because the coin slots are up too high.”</p>
<p>It’s still early days but Jayne plans to develop similar audio technology that’s used in ATMs to vending machines so they can ‘talk’ to customers who can’t read the screens.</p>
<p>Jayne is one of 24 Waikato students who won a $5000 scholarship to do a 10-week Summer Start-Up Programme, a new initiative developed by the University and Waikato Students’ Union (WSU).</p>
<p>The programme started on 16 November will run in Hamilton and Tauranga until 12 February - with a three-week break over Christmas. This gives students 10 weeks to develop their own project or idea with the help of an expert start-up coach, workshops and full-access to a shared working space.</p>

<p>Jayne says applying for the programme was easy because she was so excited about her idea.</p>
<p>“I never thought I’d get it though – I had to re-read the email several times to believe it,” she says.</p>
<p>Part of her project involves doing a survey to identify what barriers people experience when using vending machines. If you’re interested in doing the survey, please contact Jayne at <a href="mailto:jks27@students.waikato.ac.nz">jks27@students.waikato.ac.nz</a>  </p>
<p>Jayne is health conscious and says the contents of the vending machines will also be a focus of her project.</p>
<p>Originally from England, Jayne moved to Hamilton in 1995 and did her last year of secondary school at Fairfield College. The 37-year-old is now in her final year of a Bachelor of Laws and hopes to combine her interest in policy with her desire to make health more accessible to everyone.</p>
