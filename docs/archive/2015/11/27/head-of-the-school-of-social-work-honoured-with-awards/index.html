<p><strong>Head of the School of Social Work honoured with awards</strong></p>
<p>Associate Professor Kieran O’Donoghue has been awarded a Certificate of Excellence for research in the inaugural Aotearoa New Zealand Association of Social Workers (ANZASW) Quality and Innovation Awards.</p>
<p>The Head of the School of Social Work also shared the overall ANZASW trophy.</p>
<p>Dr O’Donoghue was officially presented with the award at the Association’s Manawatu Branch Annual General Meeting in Palmerston North last night by the Association’s president Karen Shepherd.</p>
<p>“I am very humbled to receive the award and the recognition given to my recent research publications on social work supervision by the social work profession.”</p>
<p>Dr O’Donoghue also acknowledged the leading contribution that Massey University’s School of Social Work makes to the field of social service supervision through its Postgraduate Diploma in Social Service Supervision and ongoing research in this area.</p>
<p>“The award also illustrates the importance that supervision has within the caring professions as a process to enhance practitioner learning and development and to improve practice outcomes for people who use social services.”</p>
<p>His current research includes a national survey of registered social workers’ supervision experiences and practices, and an evaluation of the supervision of allied health professionals across two regional health providers.</p>
<p>In honouring Dr O’Donoghue, the judging panel remarked:</p>
<p>“This certificate is awarded to Kieran O’Donoghue in showing the exhaustive research approach undertaken to develop innovative yet grounded social work practice.</p>

<p>Through the range of publications presented in the application, the research evidences models and frameworks that are important to inform the development of social work supervision. The diverse range of approaches illustrates utilising substantive research methodology to analyse a historical review of supervision research, as well as other research of current practice. In addition the value of the work presented is demonstrated through the practical application offered beyond the academic reading audience, into evidence-based social work practice in Aotearoa and internationally.”</p>
