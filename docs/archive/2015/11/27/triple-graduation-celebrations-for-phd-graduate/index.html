<p><strong>Triple graduation celebrations for PhD graduate</strong></p>
<p>For some the thought of studying for 15 years would be a nightmare, but for Carole Fernandez the journey has been one she will never forget.</p>
<p>Today Ms Fernandez becomes Dr Fernandez. The 59-year-old graduates with a PhD after starting her studies with Massey in 2000. And next month two of her six children graduate with degrees in music - Ethnomusicology and Sound Engineering – from the University of Otago.</p>
<p>Her doctoral journey began six years ago at Te-Pūtahi-a-Toi – the School of Māori Art, Knowledge and Education. Later she transferred to Te Pūmanawa Hauora - the Maori Health Research Unit at Massey’s School of Public Health - to complete a PhD in Public Health.</p>
<p>While Dr Fernandez comes from a mixed ethnic make-up - Portuguese, Irish and Javanese - she is connected to Māori through her children who affiliate themselves with Ngāti Whātua and Te Āti Haunui_-_a-Pāpārangi.</p>
<p>She says studying for so long wasn’t something she had planned. She had already completed her Master of Nursing and a Post Graduate Diploma in Evaluation at Massey’s then-College of Education. But working with an iwi provider in the health sector fuelled her desire to make a positive contribution to health service delivery for Maori.</p>
<p>“My research was an exploration of the service delivery model Whakawhirinakitanga Ahua developed by Best Care Whakapai Hauora Charitable Trust. It looked at Māori and non-Māori who work together within the organisation to deliver services for Māori and their whanau.</p>

<p>“It demonstrated the application of tikanga-based principles and values used in collaborative processes when working with Maori and whanau, and also when working at the interface with mainstream service providers. It illustrated a parallel between tikanga-based principles and Treaty principles, and highlighted the model’s capacity for inter-sectoral collaboration towards integrating care.”</p>
<p>Dr Fernandez says the differences between client-centred care and whanau-focused care were evident. “Together with all those who walked along this PhD journey with me, I discovered that we were creating knowledge with the potential to shift mind-sets from focusing on processes and service delivery systems, to a values-based approach in care.”</p>
<p>She says while there were many high points when undertaking her PhD, there were also many challenges. “There were times when I questioned everything, when I couldn’t see the forest for the trees and felt lost. I was very fortunate to have excellent support from my supervisors who always encouraged me. When I went off track, they were always there to guide me back.</p>
<p>“The support of my co-workers, management, the kaumatua at work and especially my own family, lifted me, making me realise I had something valuable to contribute to the organisation and for those accessing health services.</p>
<p>“It was such a privilege being able to share my views and opinions with other likeminded PhD candidates, and be given the opportunity to present findings at seminars. I also enjoyed the flexibility in terms of being able to work full time, and study part time.”</p>
<p>She says the most rewarding aspect has been the many relationships she has made during her studies. “It has been a life changing experience for me. I continually ask myself ‘If I knew what was ahead, would I have embarked on this doctoral journey? And my answer is definitely, YES!’”</p>
