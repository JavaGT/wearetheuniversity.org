<p><strong>Sunday, 15 February 2015, 10:56 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Supergold Cardholders Losing Choice on Ferry Route</strong></p>
<p>A New Zealand ferry operator will have to refuse SuperGold cardholders as passengers while the National government continues to support a foreign-owned monopoly, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“SuperGold cardholders are being denied a choice on the Auckland to Waiheke service” says New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.<br>“It’s unfair but Kiwi company Explore Group has no alternative but to stop carrying SuperGold cardholders as the government will not allow the company a share of the SuperGold Card subsidy.<br>“For the past four months Explore has been carrying SuperGold passengers at their own expense.<br>“But the Fullers Waiheke Ferry service receives the full payment of $1.5 million for carrying SuperGold passengers despite many now travelling on Explore.</p>
<p>“It is only fair that Explore Group receive their proportionate share of the $1.5 million allocation.<br>SuperGold cardholders spoke out for a fairer distribution of the existing subsidy at the Auckland terminal today.</p>
<p>“Why should SuperGold cardholders be restricted in their choice of transport service and timetable when other New Zealanders are not?</p>
<p>“It’s ironic that the very government that is refusing to hold up the integrity of the card has a Minister for Senior Citizens.</p>
<p>“Successive Ministers of Transport have been stalling and extending the end date for their own review of the transport subsidies. They are avoiding decision making, a hallmark of the National government.</p>
<p>“National has no problem finding money for South Canterbury Finance, Rio Tinto and now SkyCity casino, yet it is stalling on a pittance.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First is calling on the government to work for SuperGold cardholders in good faith and start with delivering them a choice on this route.”</p>
