<p><strong>Wednesday, February 25, 2015</strong><br><strong>Circus theme for Shakespeare’s King Lear</strong></p>
<p>The tragedy of <em>King Lear</em> gets a makeover as a freak show/circus in this year’s Summer Shakespeare, directed by Chilean-born dramatist and Massey University Visiting Artist-in-Residence Jaime Dörner.</p>
<p>Dörner says the freak show concept – with a bearded Goneril and two-headed Regan as Lear’s avaricious daughters – is designed to bring out the grotesque aspects of the characters’ natures. Their husbands, the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall, assume circus personas as a strongman and knife-thrower.</p>
<p>And King Lear, played by seasoned thespian and drama teacher Ralph Johnson, will take on a freakish appearance with the help of makeup and prosthetics.</p>
<p><em>King Lear</em> starts on Thursday, 5 March at the Victoria Esplanade Gardens in Palmerston North. Costumes have all been designed and made for the show, and gypsy-flavoured circus music composed by musical director Suzy Hawes will add to the colourful, carnival extravaganza.</p>
<p>Dörner, who is directing a Summer Shakespeare production in Palmerston North for the second time as a Massey University Visiting Artist-in-Residence (the first was <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> four years ago), says his aim was to create a strong aesthetic that would underpin the “outrageous” motivations of the Lear family, and the drama of the story.</p>
<p>The plot revolves around the decision of the elderly King Lear to divide his kingdom and wealth between his three daughters in return for a declaration of their affections. Greed, betrayal, madness and grief ensue as the family self-destructs and Lear teeters towards the realisation of what genuine love means.</p>

<p>Dörner, who has lived in New Zealand for nine years including seven in Palmerston North, says he was not a huge fan of Shakespeare when he first encountered his plays at high school in Chile, where he read the texts in Spanish translation.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, he discovered a passion for the narratives and language of the Bard, with <em>Hamlet</em> his all-time favourite.</p>
<p>Massey University third-year Bachelor of Arts (English) student Kat Sowerby, who plays the Fool and is one of several Massey students involved in the production, says performing on stage is a dream come true. She saw Dörner’s <em>A Midsummer Nights’ Dream</em> and longed to be up on stage but was too shy to consider acting then.</p>
<p>During her degree she has taken every theatre paper taught by award-winning playwright and School of English and Media Studies lecturer Associate Professor Angie Farrow, and says she has gained a lot more confidence along the way.</p>
<p>She has discovered her love of literature – especially New Zealand fiction – and is hoping to do postgraduate study. Enrolling in a BA was the best decision, she says, as it has opened up numerous areas of interest. “I love learning, and see myself as a life-long learner.”</p>
<p>Ms Sowerby is one of three Fools – all played by women – in Dörner’s <em>King Lear</em>.</p>
<p>Set designer Leda Farrow is also applying her studies to the stage. She has a Fine Arts degree with First Class Honours from the College of Creative Arts in Wellington.</p>
<p>The production is Dörner’s final work as a director in Palmerston North. He is heading to Monash University in Melbourne to do a PhD on the cathartic and healing powers of theatre.</p>
<p>Dr Farrow says the Summer Shakespeare is very much a “town-gown production.”</p>
<p>Massey is the major sponsor of Summer Shakespeare, which is also supported by the city&#39;s Creative Communities and Eastern Central Trust. It was initiated 13 years ago and is produced annually by the School of English and Media Studies.</p>
