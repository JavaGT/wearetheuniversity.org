<p><strong>AUT Future of Work Conference 9 February 2015</strong></p>
<p>Future of work experts and practitioners will share their diverse knowledge at an AUT University conference on 9 February.</p>
<p>More than 20 speakers, including researchers from AUT and beyond, policy makers and employers, will present on a wide range of topics, providing attendees (including HR practitioners and employers) with a ‘big picture’ understanding of the future of work.</p>
<p>Labour Party MP Grant Robertson will open the conference with an introduction to the Labour Party’s recently announced Future of Work Commission.</p>
<p>Topics covered will include the mental and physical health of workers, precarious employment, teleworking, Maori leadership, diversity and the ageing workforce.</p>
<p>For a full list of presenters and topics, see the conference schedule</p>
<p>“Rapid workplace change is being driven by new digital technologies, globalisation, environmental pressures, changing workforce demographics and new forms of social interaction,” says conference organiser and co-director of AUT’s New Zealand Work Research Institute Professor Tim Bentley. “The changing nature of work has big implications for the New Zealand economy and for employers, educators and workers.”</p>
<p>Journalists are welcome to attend the conference. For more information or to register, contact: Aimee Wilkins, Communications Manager, AUT University <a href="mailto:aimee.wilkins@aut.ac.nz">aimee.wilkins@aut.ac.nz</a></p>
