<p><strong>Monday, 23 February 2015, 1:56 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>23 February 2015</p>
<p><em>-for immediate release</em></p>
<p><strong>New role gives support to Māori and Pacific students</strong></p>
<p>Jo Frew is not averse to tapping on the shoulder of students at Lincoln University if she does not recognise the face and feels she should.</p>
<p>She is Lincoln’s new Māori and Pacific support coordinator and her role, to help those students achieve success, is part of an expanding multi-faceted approach by the University.</p>
<p>This year Lincoln will be offering its Diploma of Agriculture course within the agricultural initiative Whenua Kura – a Ngāi Tahu-led partnership between Te Tapuae o Rehua, Ngāi Tahu Farming and the University, which seeks to grow Māori leadership in agriculture.</p>
<p>The University has also created a new position of Professor in Māori and Indigenous Development.</p>
<p>These initiatives come under the University’s Whenua Strategy, an organisation-wide overarching plan.</p>
<p>The strategy positions Lincoln University as a key enabler of Māori-relevant teaching and research to underpin a thriving land-based economy which offers Māori communities increased opportunities for social, cultural and economic transformation.</p>
<p>Part of Jo’s role will be to monitor student progress as well as be someone they can come to for help.</p>
<p>“I will be the point of call for any issues — I can help identify support services.”</p>
<p>Jo will have a busy introduction as she will also work at the LincolnFirst Telford campus near Balclutha as well as in other parts of the country where programmes are delivered, such as Northland, and in schools.</p>

<p>With a background of 20 years in the Army as a medic, where she reached the rank of staff sergeant, as well as four years helping to run the Limited Service Volunteer course at Burnham and having her own business for 11 years, she is well qualified to deal with a wide variety of people.</p>
<p>She completed a Bachelor of Commerce in valuation and property management at Lincoln in 2010,</p>
<p>so student life is still fresh in her mind.</p>
<p>Jo says she will be seeking to make contact initially with first-year students, but she will also be talking with staff to offer some advice on how teaching can be done in ways which accord with Māori ways and values.</p>
<p>She says many of the parents of Māori students were gratified to know their children had someone who was Māori to watch over them at Lincoln.</p>
<p>She says the range of cultures she is working with includes indigenous students from places such as Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>To be effective in her role it was important to respect different values, beliefs and customs, as well as realising different cultures behaved differently, even over something such as asking for help.</p>
