<p>Lincoln scholars set to tackle the big issues</p>
<p>First year Lincoln University students Maddy Albertson and Chester Potter want to make a difference in the world, especially when it comes to the pressing problem of climate change.</p>
<p>Both have been awarded Global Challenges Scholarships and will be among the first students to take part in a new nationwide programme designed to deal with important issues in a practical way and at a local level, says Lincoln University Deputy Vice-Chancellor International and Business Development Jeremy Baker.</p>
<p>“We don’t want people to wait until they leave university before they start making a difference; we want them to be able to make a difference right now,” Mr Baker says.</p>
<p>Along with 56 other scholars, Maddy and Chester will act as ambassadors for the Global Challenges Programme, which aims to highlight concerns such as food production and security, as well as resource depletion and pollution, and provide teaching resources to secondary schools.</p>
<p>The scholars are expected to liaise closely with the schools, as well as take part in community work.</p>
<p>Maddy, who lives in Lincoln and attended Marian College in Christchurch, is passionate about environmental concerns.</p>
<p>“Climate change links to every other problem in the world,” she says. “It not only affects people, it affects economy, culture and every other part of our lives.”</p>
<p>Mr Baker echoes this sentiment. “One of Lincoln’s strengths is working from a systems perspective; showing how things are connected. For example, if you want to solve fossil fuel problems by using biofuels, food prices will go up. It’s important to address issues in a multi-faceted way.”</p>

<p>Maddy says she expects the programme to offer networking opportunities and the ability to connect with more people than would be possible otherwise.</p>
<p>“Eventually, I’d like to get into politics, so I can be in a position to actually make the big decisions,” she says.</p>
<p>Chester has come to Lincoln from Pakuranga College in Auckland, and says two visits to the Tasman Glacier sparked his interest in environmental issues.</p>
<p>“I’m really into tramping and the outdoors, so climate change is a big one for me,” he says. “What made me realise how important it is, was when I went to Tasman Glacier two years in a row, and the second time I went I could actually see the decline compared to the year before. If you can witness that kind of change in such a short time, it really changes your perspective.”</p>
<p>Both students are studying towards a Bachelor in Environment and Society.</p>
<p>SchoolsLinc Programme Manager Fiona Scott says now is the perfect time for the scholars to be tackling global problems.</p>
<p>“We want to capture students while they’re passionate about saving the world. A lot of young people care about these issues, but once they leave school, it can be overwhelming for them to know what to do and they give up. This programme gives them the opportunity to work with other students to identify global issues and find practical and local-level activities that can help solve them,” she says.</p>
<p>When applying for the scholarship, applicants needed to submit a video in which they discussed a specific global problem and spoke about how their studies at Lincoln University would help them to address the issue.</p>
<p>“Obviously academic merit was important, but we really wanted the scholars to be able to promote the issues in an exciting way so others would want to get involved,” Mr Baker says. “They need to be passionate about the issues, as well as personable.”</p>
<p>Ms Scott says the scholars must also show initiative. “It’s a very active programme, so they should be self-directed.”</p>
