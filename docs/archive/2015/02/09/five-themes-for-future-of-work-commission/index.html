<p><strong>Monday, 9 February 2015, 11:16 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Five themes for Future of Work Commission</p>
<p>The Labour Party&#39;s Future of Work Commission will focus on five core themes critical to ensuring New Zealand takes the opportunities presented by the rapid changes in working life</p>
<p>Speaking today at the Future of Work Conference at the Auckland University of Technology, Chair of the Commission and Labour Finance spokesperson Grant Robertson outlined the themes and structure of the Commission that will run over the next two years.</p>
<p>“The five work streams are: technology, security of work and income, education and training, Maori and Pasifika, and economic development and sustainability.</p>
<p>“Each stream will be led by relevant Labour spokespeople who will alongside business, academics, workers and community representatives to develop policy options.</p>
<p>“The Commission will be guided by a reference group of people with a mix of backgrounds and skills relevant to the future of work.</p>
<p>“There will be plenty of ways for New Zealanders to provide comment and ideas. The first is an on-line survey being launched today that will ask Kiwis to give us their experience of work – all the way from their first job through to their hopes and fears about work in the future.</p>
<p>“At the end of the Commission&#39;s work we want to have a programme and policies clearly mapped out to ensure there is decent work, lower unemployment, higher wages, greater economic security and high skilled and resilient workers.</p>
<p>“Labour has always been the party of work and workers. The nature of work is changing and we must stay ahead of developments to provide the leadership New Zealand needs. The Future of Work Commission is a critical contribution to getting this right,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
