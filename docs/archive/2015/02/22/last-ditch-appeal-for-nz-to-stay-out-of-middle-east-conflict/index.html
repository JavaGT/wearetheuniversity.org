<p><strong>Peters Makes Last Ditch Appeal for Nz to Stay Out of Middle East Conflict</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand has been taken covertly into another war without due thought of the severe long term consequences , says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister must come clean and lay out all the reasons to Parliament, says New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>Mr Peters says it is becoming obvious that John Key is a victim of the endless stream of propaganda that tribal groups and fanatics, with decades of religious differences, use to threaten our way of life.</p>
<p>“There will be a tragic outcome from any involvement by New Zealand. We are not working under the legal umbrella of the United Nations, just on a request from one of the factions with a grudge against others.</p>
<p>“In line with our independence and new responsibilities on the United Nations Security Council, we should be calm and measured in our approach, working to help end conflicts - not help start new wars.”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says New Zealand has always gone to the aid of causes it believed in and there are thousands of graves overseas that show the price we paid.</p>
<p>“The Middle East has to start addressing its problems. When those countries wake up to the mayhem and suffering they are inflicting on their people and learn some tolerance towards each other, perhaps then we should provide assistance that does not involve organised killing.</p>
<p>“Iraq is riddled with corruption, billions of dollars in aid, and payment for the Iraqi military has disappeared into many pockets. How can we send young men and women to risk death for these people?”</p>
<p>Mr Peters says a foolish decision to commit troops to Iraq should not be made like one of John Key’s backroom deals like the Sky City casino fiasco.</p>
<p>“He must come to Parliament with his information and MPs should discuss it in a completely bi-partisan atmosphere.</p>
<p>“This is a moral obligation because New Zealand is being dragged into a conflict without end.”</p>
