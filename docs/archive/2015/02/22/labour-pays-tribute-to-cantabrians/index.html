<p><strong>Sunday, 22 February 2015, 10:47 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Labour pays tribute to Cantabrians</strong></p>
<p>The Labour Party today stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of Canterbury as they mark four years since the devastating earthquake that took way loved ones and destroyed their city.</p>
<p>Labour Leader Andrew Little -- who was in Christchurch during the 2011 quake -- says while it is a time of sadness, it is also a time of hope and optimism.</p>
<p>“The February 22nd earthquake changed the lives of many Cantabrians forever. Labour acknowledges those still grieving, those still struggling with injuries and trauma, and those still frustrated by the challenges of rebuilding their homes or their businesses.</p>
<p>“But the earthquake also brought people together and fostered a deep sense of resilience.</p>
<p>“The recent hosting of the opening of the Cricket World Cup marked a turning point in the rebuild and the visible pride of Cantabrians was felt throughout New Zealand.</p>
<p>“While there is still much work to do, today is also a time to recognise how far Canterbury has come,” Andrew Little says.</p>
