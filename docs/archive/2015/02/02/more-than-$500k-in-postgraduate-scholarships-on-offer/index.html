<p>2 February, 2015</p>
<p><strong>More than $500k in postgraduate scholarships on offer</strong></p>
<p>Twelve highly prestigious masters and doctoral scholarships are being offered by Waikato University’s research institutes.</p>
<p>The university has six research institutes, each offering a doctoral scholarship worth up to $85,000, and a masters scholarship worth $12,000.</p>
<p>The institutes offering the scholarships are the Environmental Research Institute (ERI), the Institute for Business Research (IBR), the Institute of Professional Learning: Te Whai Toi Tangata (IPL), the National Institute of Demographic and Economic Analysis (NIDEA), Te Kotahi Research Institute (TKRI), and the Wilf Malcolm Institute of Educational Research (WMIER).</p>
<p>The university’s Pro Vice-Chancellor (Postgraduate), Professor Kay Weaver, says there was a high calibre of applicants last year.</p>
<p>“For successful applicants, these scholarships act as a springboard to success and a career head-start. Last year we saw a growth in the quality and quantity of applicants and we expect that to increase again this year.</p>
<p>“Last year’s scholarship winners are researching topical issues that can shape public policy, influence curriculum design and education, implement environmental change, and contribute to the economic success of Māori.”</p>
<p>The doctoral scholarships are available to domestic and international students, whereas the masters scholarship is available to domestic students only. Awardees of both the doctoral and masters scholarships are required to study full-time.</p>
