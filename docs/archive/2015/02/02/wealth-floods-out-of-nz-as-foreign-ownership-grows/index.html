<p>Wealth Floods Out of NZ as Foreign Ownership Grows</p>
<p>The wealth of rural towns is being exported as foreign buyers snap up New Zealand farms and businesses, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“Rural towns are the mechanics who fix machinery, the truck drivers who carry the stock, and other vital support for farmers, but that’s as far as farm wealth goes under foreign ownership,” says Primary Industries Spokesperson Richard Prosser.</p>
<p>“All of New Zealand is a loser. We get little spin-off as farm profits are exported by overseas owners, which are often large corporates.</p>
<p>“These corporates are able to have a vertically integrated structure that allows them to keep both supply lines and exports, and hence expenses and profits, within the company.</p>
<p>“In December, the Overseas Investment Office (OIO) approved another 3000 hectares of dairy farms for foreign ownership, this time in Canterbury. It has to stop.</p>
<p>“Canterbury dairy farms are going to Europeans, the Invercargill sheep milk powder processing plant has been sold to the Chinese and German-owned Turners &amp; Growers is waiting for OIO approval to buy two tomato farms in Bay of Plenty and Waikato – of course they will get it, OIO approves 100 per cent of applications.</p>
<p>“Non-residents should not be able to buy New Zealand land, housing and businesses. New Zealand First is not against foreign investment, but we want to make sure it benefits New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Profits should be kept in New Zealand to benefit everyone, especially rural communities, as they provide the lion’s share of our exports, keeping our economy afloat and the Kiwi lifestyle intact,” says Mr Prosser.</p>
