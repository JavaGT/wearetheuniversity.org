<p><strong>University announces key partnerships with more to come.</strong></p>
<p>The University of Canterbury today announced key partnerships with the Crusaders, and Tactix, with a community engagement and a performing arts initiative still in development.</p>
<p>These partnerships are complemented by UC support for two significant cultural events – Te Matatini Kapa Haka festival and Ngā Mana K_ō_rero Māori speech competition.</p>
<p>“These partnerships are a carefully considered and modest programme that will help drive UC’s stronger engagement with Christchurch and the Canterbury community and schools, using existing redirected promotional budget,” University Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says.</p>
<p>“Sport is a massive part of Canterbury’s DNA, and a big part of what we do at UC, through our sports coaching programme, health sciences, bio-mechanics, and sports psychology. Around 2500 students participate in UC sports clubs and societies and around 8000 are members of the UC Rec Centre.</p>
<p>“Partnering with these two leading participatory sports will help us begin a conversation with young people and their parents about UC and the wide range of academic options available here through schools engagement activity involving players, and match day activities.</p>
<p>“The Crusaders partnership will see First XV boys’ secondary schools rugby teams competing for the UC Championship, and girls’ teams for the UC Cup.</p>
<p>“It’s well known that UC already has a vibrant student culture with the most student clubs of any university, but clearly both sports partnerships will add considerably to UC’s engagement with schools. While we have strong academic programmes in recreation, sport and physical education which may appeal to particular students, promoting UC as a community which values active learning and healthy lifestyles is attractive to a significant number of young people. Further by associating with significant cultural events the diversity of interests of prospective and current students is recognised,” Dr Carr says</p>

<p>Crusaders chief executive Hamish Riach says: “We are thrilled to have the University of Canterbury on board as a Crusaders partner, and see the University as a great fit for the secondary schools rugby competition. The UC Championship and the new UC Cup will help to develop the next generation of rugby stars, just as the University of Canterbury is developing our next generation of talent in numerous other fields.”</p>
<p>Netball Mainland chief executive Brigit Heard says: “UC offers their students a ‘world class environment’ which promotes individual growth and development, which is what we’re aiming for at the Tactix. We are fortunate to have a world class tertiary institution in the Mainland netball zone, which delivers great sporting programmes and are looking forward to this partnership.”</p>
<p>Dr Carr said the bicultural elements of the programme were equally important.</p>
<p>“We’re determined our students will take their place in a bi-cultural nation, and take that cultural awareness to the world. We want to build on numerous cultural outreach programmes and encourage more Māori and Pasifika students to study at UC, which is why are supporting key cultural events.</p>
<p>“UC has a proud history in Christchurch and Canterbury and has a vital role in the future success of our city, region and New Zealand through our world-class teaching and research, the young people we bring here, and the quality graduates we produce. Our partner organisations are among Canterbury’s and New Zealand’s finest. We are looking forward to working collaboratively with our partners and schools to make Christchurch and Canterbury the best place in New Zealand for young people to study, live, have fun and be part of a community that is active, exciting and forward looking.</p>
