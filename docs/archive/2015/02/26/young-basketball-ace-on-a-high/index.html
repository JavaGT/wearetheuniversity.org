<p><strong>Young basketball ace on a high</strong></p>
<p>A young basketball player is following in the footsteps of some of the country’s top athletes as he embarks on his first year of a sports scholarship programme at Lincoln University.</p>
<p>Ben Bowie, who lives in Lincoln, was awarded a basketball scholarship after acing several rigorous fitness tests that were given to all the hopefuls who applied for the programme.</p>
<p>The towering 18-year-old, who stands at 196cm tall, has been playing basketball for about two years at competitive level. However, he was involved in the game socially for a few years before that.</p>
<p>“Playing socially definitely got me enjoying the sport. I also grew reasonably tall quite late at high school, which helped,” he says.</p>
<p>The University sports scholars undertake an intensive athletic programme while studying towards their academic qualification and receive specialised training in one of eight codes – basketball, cricket, golf, field hockey, netball, rowing or rugby.</p>
<p>“We aim to help our scholars develop their sporting abilities to a professional level, but we also make sure their sporting success is well-balanced with academic study,” says sports scholarship manager Peter Magson.</p>
<p>The programme was the first of its kind in New Zealand when it began in 1999, Mr Magson says. It has produced several well-known sportspeople over the years, including Richie McCaw, Sam Whitelock and Todd Astle.</p>
<p>Bowie is studying Agribusiness and Food Marketing, and says he intends to look for work overseas and continue playing basketball when he finishes his studies.</p>

<p>“I want to play for New Zealand, but possibly further,” he says. “Making the Rams is a possibility over the next few years too.”</p>
<p>Although now focused on basketball, Bowie has played several other sports in the past, including cricket and rugby and cites McCaw as an inspiration.</p>
<p>“Richie McCaw is definitely an inspiring person,” says Bowie. “He has become a Kiwi icon due to being captain of the All Blacks, which is pretty admirable.</p>
<p>“As far as basketball goes, I like to base my game around people like [NBA player] Anthony Davis.”</p>
<p>He says he also keeps a close eye on such players as Thomas Abercrombie and CJ Bruton.</p>
