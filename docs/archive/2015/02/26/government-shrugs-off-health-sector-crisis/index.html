<p><strong>Thursday, 26 February 2015, 3:43 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Government shrugs off health sector crisis</p>
<p>Despite new evidence showing that cuts to health spending are costing lives the Government continues to deny the sector is struggling, Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“Health services in New Zealand are in crisis.</p>
<p>“In just two days we have heard about New Zealanders <a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/267111/cancer-survival-rates-lower-in-nz">dying unnecessarily</a> because access to cancer treatment was too slow, of Counties Manukau District Health Board warning it may be unable to cope with patient numbers because of a $100 million shortfall and thousands of patients being dumped of waiting lists for vital surgery.</p>
<p>“Health Minister Jonathan Coleman is aware of the issue, signalling in a Cabinet paper he signed off after consultation with the Minister of Finance, that a $320 million boost to DHBs – Treasury wants $250 million – for 2015/16 would ‘make it extremely challenging to manage pressures in Vote Health’.</p>
<p>“However today his offsider Peseta Sam Lotu-Iinga was in full denial, claiming no decisions had been made.</p>
<p>“In the Cabinet paper the Minister pointed out funding advice is usually given to DHBs in early December to ensure they can complete first drafts of their annual plans.</p>
<p>“Someone’s not telling the truth. DHBs need certainty to be able to plan and provide services, not fairy tales from a stand-in Minister,” Annette King said.</p>
