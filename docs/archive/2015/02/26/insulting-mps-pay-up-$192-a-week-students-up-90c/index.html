<p>‘Insulting’: MPs’ pay up $192 a week – students’ up 90c</p>
<p>26 February 2015</p>
<p>Media Release: New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations<br>Students are outraged that the same week the Government announced a 90 cents-a-week increase to student support – well behind rising housing costs-, MPs are in line to give themselves a $10,000 per year pay hike –or $192.30 a week.</p>
<p>The Government announced the particularly small 0.51 per cent CPI-adjustment for students and other citizens receiving state support on Monday. The adjustment increases the maximum student allowance from $174.21 to $175.10 per week. The maximum student loan living cost payment rises from $175.96 to $176.86. The accommodation benefit, which is capped at $40 a week, did not rise at all.</p>
<p>National Student President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations Rory McCourt said the situation would lead to many New Zealanders questioning the priorities of the nation’s leaders.</p>
<p>“While MPs are giving themselves an extra $192 a week, students in Auckland expected to pay their average rent of $220 a week with a $40 accommodation grant. It’s ludicrous.” says McCourt.</p>
<p>“Accommodation costs are galloping ahead of general inflation, which means students are actually falling behind. Just last week TradeMe revealed a 9 per cent hike in average New Zealand rents for the year to January. For students, it’s even worse.”</p>
<p>“This pay hike for politicians is insulting when real kiwis are struggling with the effects of the housing crisis. Student support hasn’t cut it for a long time, but now we’re really feeling the sharp edge of the housing crisis.”</p>

<p>“We just want to be able to pay the rent. It’s students who need a top-up, not politicians.” says McCourt.</p>
<p>Figures per week:</p>
<p>Maximum student allowance: $174.21, rises to $175.10<br>Maximum accommodation benefit (for allowance students only, living away from home): $40 in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch<br>Maximum student loan living costs: $175.96, rises to $176.86<br>Average student rent in Auckland (bedroom in 3 bedroom flat): $218.16 in 2014, up from 209.90 in 2013 (based on MBIE Housing Data)<br>National average annual rent rise: 9% to January 2015 (TradeMe)<br>ENDS  </p>
