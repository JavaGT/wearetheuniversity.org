<p><strong>A policewoman, a diplomat and a chief executive to be awarded honorary doctorates</strong></p>
<p><strong>February 12, 2015</strong></p>
<p>A policewoman, a diplomat and a chief executive will be awarded honorary doctorates at the University of Canterbury graduation ceremonies in April.</p>
<p>Superintendent Sandra Manderson, a graduate of the University of Canterbury, will be awarded a Doctor of Laws. She was the first female District Commander to be appointed in New Zealand and served as Canterbury District Commander from 2002-2007.</p>
<p>She served three and a half years as Director of the Crime Prevention Unit in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and then went on to become a Shift Commander in the Wellington District. She was later appointed the National Manager of Organisational Performance at the Office of the Commissioner.</p>
<p>Superintendent Manderson was a Contingent Commander during Operation Phuket following the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. In 2007 Superintendent Manderson was appointed to the role of New Zealand police representative to the United States, Canada and South America. She became the first woman in New Zealand to achieve the rank of superintendent. She is presently National Operation Commander for New Zealand’s involvement in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 and the FIFA Under-20 World Cup 2015.</p>
<p>The award to Manderson is a welcome recognition not only of her services to the University of Canterbury, where she served on the University Council, but of the links between policing, academia and the community. It gives concrete recognition of the ties developed between the university and the police.</p>
