<p>Minister Tells Fairytale Over Jobs for Kiwis</p>
<p>Minister for Social Development Anne Tolley is living in wonderland, claiming her government has concern for New Zealand workers, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>Mrs Trolley told Parliament National wants jobs first and foremost for New Zealanders. If that is the case, why is the government allowing record immigration while 309,145 people are stuck on benefits, says Spokesperson on Labour and Industrial Relation Clayton Mitchell.</p>
<p>“Record net inflow of 50,000 migrants a year, including foreign students now allowed to work, destroys the Minister’s fairytale.</p>
<p>“Official unemployment is 143,000, and there are thousands of Kiwis in low paid, casual and part-time work and many on zero-hour work contracts. They struggle to pay living costs and would prefer full-time work.</p>
<p>“Kiwis are looking for full-time, fairly paid jobs, not competition from foreign workers for jobs in their own country.</p>
<p>“As we reminded Mrs Tolley she once warned we must be careful not to fill up all the job spaces with immigrants. That is not happening.</p>
<p>“The horticultural industry and vineyards are relying on thousands of foreign seasonal workers because over six years the National government has done little to get Kiwis into these jobs.</p>
<p>“Where are the tax breaks so growers can offer Kiwi workers fair wages, where are the schemes to pull Kiwis off welfare, get them work ready and able to hold down these jobs.</p>
<p>“Growers’ priority is to get their crops picked. New Zealand First would like to see Kiwis picking those crops</p>
<p>“National is opting for the weak solution and allowing thousands of workers in on seasonal visas. New Zealand First wants Kiwis picking those crops.</p>
<p>“We want a community wage to get Kiwis into work. That would be progress, that would be putting Kiwis first and foremost.”</p>
