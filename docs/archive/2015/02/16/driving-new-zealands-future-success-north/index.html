<p><strong>Sunday, February 15, 2015</strong><br><strong>Driving New Zealand’s future success north</strong></p>
<p>How does New Zealand want to succeed in the next 50 years, and who will be driving that success?</p>
<p>Massey University is leading the conversation with <em>Grow North</em>, a half-day symposium to be held on February 18 at the Auckland campus.</p>
<p>Participants from a range of businesses, community groups and will explore ways to make the most of New Zealand’s fastest growing region, and the challenges faced in housing, transport, health and education.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says the time is right to take stock of how far the region has come since the Auckland campus was established at Albany 22 years ago.</p>
<p>“Back in the 1990s when I first visited Massey University’s Auckland campus, there was one house. Nothing else – it was farmland as far as the eye could see. A generation later the University is surrounded by the fastest-growing population in New Zealand’s fastest-growing city.</p>
<p>“We need to carry the conversation forward and look ahead to the next 50 years. We have the opportunity to create our own version of Silicon Valley right here on the North Shore, but rapid growth needs to sit alongside visionary planning. That’s what <em>Grow North</em> is all about.”</p>
<p>Presented in partnership with Colliers International and BNZ, <em>Grow North</em> will feature a panel discussion on the challenges and opportunities faced by the exceptional growth on the North Shore. The panel includes Auckland deputy mayor Penny Hulse, Colliers International national director research and consultancy Alan McMahon, NZIER principal economist Shamubeel Eaqub, KPMG executive chairman Ross Buckley, Ngāti Whātua o Orākei Whai Rawa chief operating officer Kate Healy, and Labour MP and housing spokesperson Phil Twyford.</p>
