<p>Second Māori language learning app developed for beginners</p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington’s Faculty of Education has released its second te reo Māori learning app—Puna—which is available for free on the App Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>The app, developed by staff from Te Kura Māori, which carries out teaching and research related to Māori education, policy, and practice, is<br>a tool for children or those beginning to learn Māori. The first app—Kura—was developed for people with some level of proficiency in the language.</p>
<p>Dr Tabitha McKenzie, a lecturer from Te Kura Māori, says what sets Puna apart from other Māori learning apps on the market is that it can be tailored by the user.</p>
<p>“There are five modules of study and the learner can tailor each one with the choice of words, flash cards and voice.”</p>
<p>The words can be grouped into categories of food, living things, body, home, school, places, things that move, marae, clothes, actions and time.</p>
<p>Puna is currently all in te reo however there are plans for an English translation.<br>Words can be written out on screen using a finger, with a choice of colour and font.<br>A game can be selected with a number of options for scoring and playing—either one or two players, or competing against the smartphone software.</p>
<p>There are also notes for teachers and parents with audio samples of sentences in which the vocabulary can be used.</p>
<p>“Puna is an educational, fun and challenging way to learn te reo Māori. Users say it makes them want to learn,” says Dr McKenzie.</p>
