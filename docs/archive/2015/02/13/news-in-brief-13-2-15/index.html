<p>School of Music student composes piece for Abbey commemoration performance</p>
<p><strong>February 13, 2015</strong></p>
<p>University of Canterbury teenage music student Matthew Everingham has composed a piece to be played at Westminster Abbey in London next week to commemorate the February 2011 earthquake.</p>
<p>Everingham was commissioned by one of the university’s School of Music honours graduates and Westminster Abbey organ scholar, Jeremy Woodside to compose the piece for the fourth anniversary on February 22. The piece, named <em>Fractures: In Memoriam</em>, is about 10 minutes long and it takes listeners on a four-year journey. He is heading to London today to work with Woodside during the rehearsal period.</p>
<p>Everingham and his family lost their North New Brighton home in the February 2011 earthquake. The property was subsequently red-zoned and demolished. The rental property they moved to in Shirley was later red-zoned as well. Associate Professor Glenda Keam says the opportunity for Everingham to experience the performance of his new work at Westminster Abbey will be an extraordinary and rewarding experience.</p>
