<p><strong>Character-building more important in Japan than in New Zealand rugby circles</strong></p>
<p><strong>February 17, 2015</strong></p>
<p>A University of Canterbury research project has found that character-building is more important in Japanese schoolboy rugby than in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Sports doctoral student Blake Bennett says his research showed that responsibility and characterdevelopment were rated highly by both Japanese coaches and rugby players.</p>
<p>Decision making, humility, independence and enjoyment were given equally high priority by Japanese coaches, while Japanese players added graciousness as a perceived learning outcome.</p>
<p>“New Zealand coaches and players said decision making and teamwork were priorities in their overalllearning outcomes of rugby. New Zealand coaches wanted players to enjoy playing while players perceived fair play as a learning outcome,” Bennett says.</p>
<p>He interviewed 21 coaches in New Zealand and 20 coaches in Japan and 63 New Zealand players and 60 Japanese players. He wanted to find out the intended and perceived learning outcomes of participating in teenage rugby in both countries.</p>
<p>Research suggests that learning many life principles are among the key reasons why players and coaches get involved in sport. Learning through sport seems to be a key motivating factor for athletes and coaches to be involved with rugby.</p>
<p>“Aside from intentions to improve the overall game play ability through skill acquisition and strategic practice, New Zealand coaches cited a desire to enhance leadership qualities and a sense of school pride, in order to develop senior students’ abilities to take ownership of the performance of their school team.</p>
<p>“Coaches often cited the use of a school haka, and appreciation for school and game tradition to achieve these learning outcomes. New Zealand schoolboy players suggested that their perceptions of teamwork and its close association to camaraderie had the effect of creating an enjoyable rugby experience.</p>
<p>“This was due to the opportunity rugby provided for them to play together with their friends, share common goals, or be a part of school values and traditions. Some said they considered employment opportunities by participating in rugby.</p>
<p>“For Japanese coaches, the idea of character development was the premise of their approach coaching. They sought to promote a high level of effort during trainings and games, in order to strengthen their players’ spirit.</p>
<p>“They felt strengthening the spirit, or character building, would provide them the will to overcome any difficulty faced on or off the playing field, now and in the future – either as full-time company workers or simply as young adults in Japanese society.</p>
<p>“The topic of enjoyment was mentioned as an important factor in maintaining this environment and the gradual change in expectations of Japanese youth over the past 20 years meant that the element of enjoyment played a critical role.</p>
<p>“Young players there saw positive learning outcomes as a result of effort. Many cited their perception that playing rugby could provide them with the ability to overcome hurdles as they pushed past limits.”</p>
<p>Both New Zealand Japanese coaches felt they have not been influenced by coaching workshops run by either their national bodies. Bennett’s research was supervised by Professor Ian Culpan and Professor Richard Light.</p>
