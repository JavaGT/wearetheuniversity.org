<p><strong>Canterbury comes to Auckland</strong></p>
<p><strong>February 17, 2015</strong></p>
<p>The University of Canterbury with support from Lincoln University, Navitas and the Christchurch College of English Language (CCEL) is coming to Auckland as “Canterbury Education Partners”.</p>
<p>Canterbury Education Partners are opening an office in Queen Street, Auckland to meet the growing demand from New Zealand’s biggest city. Led by the University of Canterbury, the group will be able to offer a range of studying and research options for the Auckland market.</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury made the decision to establish an Auckland office to expand its exposure to other potential student markets, liaise more closely with Auckland schools and promote the University of Canterbury as a university of choice. University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says.</p>
<p>“We also plan to support internships and transition to work for our students. The university is ranked among the top three percent of universities in the world according to the QS world rankings. More than 14,500 students, including more than 1200 international students from more than 80 countries studied at the University of Canterbury last year,” Dr Carr says.</p>
<p>Lincoln, Education Plus, Navitas and CCEL all expressed interest in partnering the University of Canterbury in the new Auckland office venture to provide positive alternatives to Auckland students and to take advantage of the potential that is on offer in the Auckland market.</p>

<p>Lincoln University Deputy Vice-Chancellor Business Development Jeremy Baker says due to a high demand for skilled workers in the primary industries, they are in a good position to strengthen their connections with Auckland schools.</p>
<p>“Auckland plays a key role in the primary sector, with around a third of all food processing taking place in the region. We think it is important for Lincoln to build better connections with principals, teachers and careers advisors in the region, so that we can support more young people from Auckland and surrounding regions to get access to land-based careers.”</p>
<p>Navitas runs UC International College (UCIC) on the Canterbury campus. UCIC helps international students to achieve their goal of stepping up to a University of Canterbury degree. More than 150 international students have begun their studies at UCIC since it started in late October 2013.</p>
<p>CCEL is the University of Canterbury’s English language provider. Based on the university’s campus since 1991 and with a branch school in central Auckland, CCEL meets the English language tuition needs of international students moving on to UCIC or UC programmes. CCEL is a Category One English language school offering the highest possible level of academic quality and student support.</p>
<p>Also involved is the University of Canterbury’s Education Plus organisation which provides secondary English language learning and home school partnership professional development programmes, funded by the Ministry of Education to secondary schools in the Auckland region.</p>
