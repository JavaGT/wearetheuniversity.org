<p>David<br>CUNLIFFE</p>
<p>Tertiary Education spokesperson</p>
<p>30 September 2015 MEDIA STATEMENT  </p>
<p><strong>Widespread caution on tertiary league tables justified</strong></p>
<p>Steven Joyce&#39;s proposal to implement league tables for tertiary institutions takes a backward looking, short term view that could do more harm than good, Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson David Cunliffe says.</p>
<p>“The proposal, to publish data matched to Statistics and IRD showing graduate employment and salaries by subject and institution, has been widely panned by the sector.</p>
<p>&quot;While finding your first job is important, tertiary education is about learning for life and providing critical skills that will last a whole career.</p>
<p>&quot;This is exactly what Labour&#39;s <a href="http://www.futureofwork.nz/education">Future of Work</a> Commission is looking at. Graduates will change jobs more frequently and entire classes of jobs are disappearing.</p>
<p>“The <a href="http://www.ceda.com.au/2015/06/16/five-million-Aussie-jobs-gone-in-10-to-15-years">Council of Economic Development</a> of Australia estimates that 40% of current jobs will be at risk from technology change over the next 15 years and the Oxford Martin School <a href="http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf">estimates</a> 47%.</p>
<p>&quot;Steven Joyce&#39;s superficial approach is likely to send the wrong signals to students. Short term, historical data is insufficient to inform long term decisions at times of dynamic change.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than stampede students into accounting and law we actually need are more scientists, programmers and critical thinkers capable of leadership roles across diverse fields of endeavour.</p>
<p>&quot;When AgResearch has just cut 90 science jobs due to lack of funding, league tables won&#39;t encourage the best students into science careers.</p>
<p>&quot;Tertiary institutions are having to ramp up international student numbers just to make ends meet after yet another year of real tertiary funding cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;Worse, Steven Joyce seems to think the whole reason tertiary education exists is reduced to providing ‘inputs to industry’.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is passionate about growing good jobs, but we will not reduce young New Zealanders to &#39;widgets&#39; or automatons driven by short term ‘market signals’, “ David Cunliffe says .</p>
