<p><strong>Innovation to the fore as Hutt Valley hosts National Science Challenge</strong></p>
<p>The Government has launched the Science for Technological Innovation National Science Challenge, with Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce confirming funding of $32.9 million for the seventh challenge.</p>
<p>Hosted by Callaghan Innovation, it will involve three Crown research institutes and eight universities, all collaborating with businesses. Chris Bishop, National Party list MP based in the Hutt Valley says this confirms the Hutt Valley as a centre for innovation.</p>
<p>“This announcement is great news for Callaghan Innovation and for the Hutt Valley area. Businesses will have the opportunity to be involved early in the research process to help develop and commercialise ground-breaking technology,” says Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>“This funding will bring more jobs and innovation to the Hutt Valley and builds on the already significant contribution to research and innovation provided by industry in the Hutt. The Hutt Valley is leading the way when it comes to forming closer relationships between the science and business sectors.”</p>
<p>The National Science Challenges are designed to tackle the biggest science-based issues and opportunities facing New Zealand. Each Challenge includes both new funding and funds that will become available as current research contracts directly related to each Challenge mature.</p>
<p>The new Challenge money comprises $133.5 million over four years allocated in Budgets 2012 and 2013, and continuing funding of $30.5 million per year thereafter.</p>
