<p><strong>Palmerston North Student wins ANZAC memorial prize</strong></p>
<p>Local student Emma Holmes has won third prize, years 11-13, in a competition commemorating World War I – <em>Their Stories, Our Stories</em>.</p>
<p>“The competition got students to create something – be it a poem, a piece of art, or a garden – that made a connection with the New Zealand stories of WWI,” List MP Jono Naylor said.</p>
<p>“I was lucky enough to read Emma’s poem and I can see why she has received a prize for it. She did a great job! I’m sure her parents, her classmates, and the staff from Freyberg High School are pretty proud of her.</p>
<p>“I want to congratulate her and the other students on their outstanding efforts. I believe if our ANZAC veterans were alive today they would be proud and touched by these tributes.”</p>
<p>There were 18 entries awarded prizes out of 148 submitted. The entries reflected a huge amount of research, creativity and hard work, and honoured the service and sacrifice of New Zealanders who fought in WWI 100 years ago.</p>
