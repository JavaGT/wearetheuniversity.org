<p><strong>University of Otago appoints Director, International</strong></p>
<p>The University of Otago has appointed Mr Simon Chu as its Director, International. Mr Chu moves into the role from his current position as a Project Manager in the University’s International Office.</p>
<p>Mr Chu will report directly to Deputy Vice-Chancellor (External Engagement) Professor Helen Nicholson.</p>
<p>In his Director’s role Mr Chu will be responsible for advancing the University’s global visibility and reputation and ensuring that Otago is a leading destination for international students.</p>
<p>Professor Nicholson says she is delighted that Mr Chu is taking up the role.</p>
<p>“Simon is very well-placed to lead the International Office and Otago’s internationalisation efforts. He has a strong background in international education through his work as Academic Dean of the University of Otago Language Centre and Foundation Year from 2002 to 2013. He has also led the Student International Services team at Otago,” she says.</p>
<p>Before entering the tertiary sector, Mr Chu was Head of Social Sciences at Bayfield High School, Dunedin.</p>
<p>Mr Chu says he is very proud and excited to be appointed to the Director’s role as the University moves towards its 150th year.</p>
<p>“The international education environment is incredibly dynamic and as part of the new External Engagement Division, the International Office will work closely with stakeholders inside and outside of the University to pursue ongoing internationalisation.</p>
<p>“We have an opportunity to be innovative in working to increase the flow of international students coming here and of our domestic students going on exchange. We will also strive to develop new research partnerships and increase Otago’s global engagement, generally,” he says.</p>
<p>Mr Chu will take up his new role on Monday 14 September.</p>
