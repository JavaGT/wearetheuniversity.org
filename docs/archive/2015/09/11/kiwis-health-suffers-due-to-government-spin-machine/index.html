<p><strong>Kiwis’ health suffers as Government spin machine goes into overdrive</strong></p>
<p>Increasing numbers of GPs are giving up referring patients for first specialist assessments because they know it’s a waste of time, Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“Jonathan Coleman has just issued a barrage of press releases asserting increasing numbers of New Zealanders are receiving better access to specialists.</p>
<p>“He should tell that to the many people who have approached me with tales of waiting months, and sometimes years, to get an appointment.</p>
<p>“And he should tell it to the thousands of people who are referred for assessments but are then sent back to their GPs because they don’t meet pain thresholds.</p>
<p>“He might also want to have a chat to the doctors who say they no longer refer patients because they know they won’t even make it onto a waiting list.</p>
<p>“Specialists are just as frustrated, and are being forced to decline referrals because of increasing demand and shorter target times.</p>
<p>“DHBs have only been funded to maintain current services. A growing and aging population means there will be more Kiwis requiring medical care.</p>
<p>“The National Government has under-invested in the sector for years. It is a scandal that it can’t – or purposely won’t - see the affect that is now having,” Annette King says.</p>
