<p><strong>Ambassador builds ties with Lincoln</strong></p>
<p>An ambassador from the ‘food basket of Asia’ recently visited Lincoln University to discuss agribusiness and meet a few fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>Incoming Thai Ambassador to New Zealand, His Excellency Maris Sangiampongsa, and his delegation of officials were welcomed by the University’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor – International and Business Development, Mr Jeremy Baker.</p>
<p>Dr Samuel Yu, Business Development Manager at Lincoln describes Thailand, which has a population of approximately 67 million people, as the food basket of Asia.</p>
<p>“Around 50 per cent of its labour force is related to agriculture and it is a large exporter of rice.</p>
<p>“It has similar characteristics to New Zealand as a country, and as an exporter of primary produce. Gaining a better understanding between the multi-cultures in Thailand and New Zealand will help exporters, and also raise awareness that Christchurch is a good destination for studying subjects and topics that are relevant to their country’s primary sector,” Dr Yu says.</p>
<p>The Ambassador had a chance to meet with a few postgraduate students from Thailand studying PhD qualifications at Lincoln, and also got to discuss agribusiness issues with Mr Jack Radford of the Faculty of Agribusiness and Commerce, and Dr Jens Rekker of Lincoln Agritech Ltd about water-monitoring technologies.</p>
