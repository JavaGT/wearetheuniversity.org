<p>Megan<br>WOODS<br>Acting EQC Spokesperson</p>
<p>9th September 2015 MEDIA STATEMENT<br>**<br>Minister must mediate EQC lawsuit**</p>
<p>Gerry Brownlee needs to front up to the homeowners involved in a class action lawsuit against EQC and mediate a solution to avoid a costly court case, says Labour’s acting EQC spokesperson Megan Woods.</p>
<p>“EQC has been a consistent failure for years, and the Government has done nothing. Now 107 Cantabrians have had to bring a class action lawsuit in response to shoddy repairs, shonky scoping and rorting of the system.</p>
<p>“A costly court process is in no one’s interests. The Minister should sit down and mediate a solution to ensure EQC is fulfilling its obligations.</p>
<p>“A protracted court case could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. That money should be spent on getting people’s repairs done properly.</p>
<p>“EQC is lurching from crisis to crisis. People in Christchurch have no faith in them. It isn’t good enough that people are having to turn to the courts to get things resolved.</p>
<p>“It isn’t good enough for the government just to wash its hands of the problem. They should sit down and work up a solution so that people can be confident their repairs are being done on time and to a high standard,” says Megan Woods.</p>
