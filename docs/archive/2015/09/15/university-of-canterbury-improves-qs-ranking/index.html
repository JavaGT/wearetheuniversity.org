<p><strong>University of Canterbury improves QS ranking</strong></p>
<p>15 September 2015</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury has improved 31 places to 211 in the latest QS University rankings released today.</p>
<p>QS rankings assesses University reputation among academics and employers, faculty to student ratio, research citations per faculty, and the proportion of international staff and students enrolled.</p>
<p>UC Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr said the result, up from UC’s ranking of 242 in 2014, confirmed UC’s position well inside the top 3% of the world’s universities. Changes to the assessment methodology QS used this year meant the rankings better reflected UC’s position.</p>
<p>“This result underlines the fact that Cantabrians have a world-class university on their doorstep that is continuing to deliver world-class teaching and research while working to provide even more state-of-the-art facilities for future generations through an ongoing $1.2 billion capital works programme. UC offers more than 2,000 courses, has 21 disciplines in the top 200 in the world, and a record number of post-graduate students. We also have a vibrant student atmosphere, with more than 130 student clubs – the most of any New Zealand university.</p>
<p>“While some students may wish to leave home to begin their studies, these rankings confirm they don’t have to leave town to access world-class quality research-informed teaching and learning. It’s right here – accessible, affordable and of the highest quality.</p>
<p>“It also underlines for potential international students the quality of education UC offers. More than 80 nationalities are represented on campus. We value the diversity those nationalities bring to UC and work hard to promote a spirit of inclusiveness,” Dr Carr says.</p>
