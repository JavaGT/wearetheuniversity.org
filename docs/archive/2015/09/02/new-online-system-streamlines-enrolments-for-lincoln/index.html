<p>New online system streamlines enrolments for Lincoln University</p>
<p>A new online system called MyLinc is set to streamline the enrolment process for students and staff at Lincoln University, making it a positive and pain-free experience that will increase enrolments and provide world-class data security protection.</p>
<p>The system – designed by business IT consultancy Koorb and built on Microsoft’s Dynamics CRM Online platform – aims to bring the University’s student applications processes into line with best current technology options, moving the enrolment system from a paper-based to a digital environment.</p>
<p>MyLinc provides a user-friendly system that automates behind-the-scenes procedures, cuts out duplication and opens communication channels between applicants and university staff to assist potential students and ensure they receive course advice and assistance during the application process.</p>
<p>Jeremy Baker, Deputy Vice-Chancellor – International and Business Development at Lincoln University, says the University is excited to be able to offer the improved service to potential students.</p>
<p>“MyLinc makes it easy for students to apply to study, for accommodation and for scholarships all using a single portal, and to be able to monitor progress with those applications. We want to make the process of choosing to study at Lincoln as simple and student-centric as possible, and we believe the MyLinc portal is a great step in that direction.”</p>

<p>Getting the right information, at the right time, to the right person is easy now thanks to the MyLinc system, says Director of Student Administration, Rachele Allan.</p>
<p>“We aim for administration at Lincoln University to be as simple and hassle free as possible so that students can get on with their study. Our long term vision is for MyLinc to span the entire student journey from applicant to graduate and alumni,” says Ms Allan.</p>
<p>“This is step one in a multi-phase project that will eventually incorporate functions like enrolments, checking exam results and the graduation processes.”</p>
<p>Student Connection Services Manager Siobhan Nettle says the single portal system has also increased applicants’ awareness of Lincoln funded scholarships, which now appear alongside study and accommodation information.</p>
<p>Other benefits include being able to save an application and return to it later, and education agents being able to manage international student applications.</p>
<p>Evan Blackman, Education Sector Director for Microsoft New Zealand, praised the work of Koorb and Lincoln University in developing the system, which he says will also provide vital protection of student data with the security that comes by running the system via the Microsoft cloud.</p>
