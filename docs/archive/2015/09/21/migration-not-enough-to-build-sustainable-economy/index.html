<p><strong>Migration not enough to build sustainable economy</strong></p>
<p>The Green Party is calling on the Government to embrace low-carbon economic development opportunities, because economic growth from record migration and the runaway Auckland housing market is unsustainable.</p>
<p>“High migration is part of National’s facade of economic prosperity – migration-driven economic activity is part of what’s hiding the fact that National’s economic policies are failing,” said Green Party finance spokesperson Julie Anne Genter.</p>
<p>Statistics NZ has released monthly migration statistics that show a record net gain of 60,300 migrants in the year to August 2015.</p>
<p>“If we take away the economic activity caused by migration, Auckland’s dangerous house price inflation, and the Christchurch rebuild, there’s no real substance to National’s economy,” Ms Genter said.</p>
<p>“GDP might still be growing, albeit slowly, but hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders aren’t seeing any net positive effect on their lives – including the 148,000 people who are out of work.</p>
<p>“Falling consumer confidence shows that many New Zealanders want the Government to provide a new economic direction, according to Westpac.</p>
<p>“Migration at sustainable levels is a good thing, but the Government needs to invest in smart infrastructure to support low-carbon prosperity and the growing population.</p>
<p>“High-quality, medium-density housing and improved public transport will create jobs and improve our quality of life. National is taking us in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>“If we invest in making our cities smart and liveable, innovative high-value businesses will choose to locate there,” said Ms Genter.</p>
