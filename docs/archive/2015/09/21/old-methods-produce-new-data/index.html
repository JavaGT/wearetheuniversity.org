<p><strong>Old methods produce new data</strong></p>
<p>Old fishing methods are providing the raw data that modern techniques can’t match in the Rotorua Lakes.</p>
<p>University of Waikato alumnus Dr Ian Kusabs is a fisheries adviser to Te Arawa and Ngāti Tuwharetoa and is researching the state of kōura (freshwater crayfish) in the central North Island lakes.</p>
<p>He says the aim is to examine catch rates for kōura and use those to develop a sustainable management plan for the delicacy.</p>
<p>Kōura were an important food source for Te Arawa, were used in trade and Dr Kusabs says they are a “keystone” species, crucial to the health of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>“There was anecdotal information that numbers have declined since the arrival of Pākeha,” he says.<br>In 2006 the Te Arawa Lakes Settlement Act allowed Te Arawa to manage the fishery and Dr Kusabs says they are looking at developing regulations and management plans.</p>
<p>However, with limited information available, Dr Kusabs says gathering credible data was an important issue.</p>
<p>“We needed to develop suitable monitoring methods. We tried spot lighting, scuba, underwater cameras and baited traps but they all had problems.”</p>
<p>Traps had a low catch rate, caught mainly larger specimens and mostly the more aggressive males. They were also susceptible to theft and needed to be retrieved early each day.</p>
<p>Scuba, spot lighting and underwater cameras also had issues with things such as murky water or being weather dependent.</p>
<p>So Dr Kusabs consulted local kaumatua who suggested using traditional methods of catching kōura.</p>
<p>That includes tau kōura, which were - in effect - bundles of fern which sit on the lake bed.</p>
<p>The kōura move into the fern fronds, which provide habitat for them. When the bundles are removed from the lake, a net is placed below it to ensure kōura don’t escape.</p>
<p>Dr Kusabs says the tau kōura they worked with – consisting of ten bundles of ferns in each - delivered outstanding results.</p>
<p>“We got a wide size range – from 7mm to 50mm OCL (Orbit Carapace Length) - an unbiased sex ratio, a good catch rate, it is cheap to set up, it can be retrieved whenever, it’s sustainable and actually enhances the fishery.”</p>
<p>Orbit Carapace Length refers to the measurement of koura, which is from behind the eyes to the end of the carapace.</p>
<p>Dr Kusabs says to have a sustainable and regulated market, researchers still need more information about the state of the kōura fishery.</p>
<p>“We need to know the abundance, biomass, size, sex ratio, breeding time, fecundity, size at breeding. We found out their breeding season was April to November and at a 28mm minimum OCL size, 50% of breeding females would have the chance to breed before growing large enough to be harvested.”</p>
<p>That information would help develop rules for the fishery. Currently kōura are restricted to 50 per person per day and commercial sales are banned.</p>
<p>Proposed regulations include tau kōura being the only allowable means of deep water harvest, a continued ban on commercial sales, retain the 50 per day limit with a 28mm minimum size, restrict the harvest to 1 December-31 March to avoid breeding season, and ban the taking of females with eggs.</p>
<p>Dr Kusabs used tau kōura on eight Rotorua lakes and found three – Rotorua, Rotoma and Rotoiti - had kōura in large enough numbers to consider harvesting. Further work will be carried out on the other seven lakes in the region.</p>
