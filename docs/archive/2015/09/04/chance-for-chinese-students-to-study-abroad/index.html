<p>Chance for Chinese students to Study Abroad</p>
<p>A group of Chinese students have arrived at Lincoln University to take part in a programme that allows them to study in New Zealand for a semester, then transfer the credit to their degrees at home.</p>
<p>The nine students, from China’s Henan Agricultural University and Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, are the second group to participate in the Study Abroad programme this year and will complete their studies at Lincoln at the end of Semester Two in November.</p>
<p>The first group, who arrived at the beginning of Semester One, returned to China in July.</p>
<p>The Study Abroad programme is available to both undergraduate and postgraduate students who meet Lincoln’s admission requirements. Depending their on academic background, students can choose from any of the courses within the faculties.</p>
<p>Director of University Studies and English Language Division, Dr Lorraine Petelo, says Lincoln has a strong relationship and a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the two Chinese universities.</p>
<p>“The programme enables students who are studying at degree level at their home university to come to New Zealand and study – it’s a wonderful opportunity and experience for the students, as well as for Lincoln.”</p>
<p>She says the students will complete an introductory academic study skills programme and take part in an orientation before they begin their study.</p>
<p>“We also provide extra English learning support throughout their first six weeks.</p>

<p>“It’s about establishing a rapport with the students and helping them to settle in so they can experience what New Zealand has to offer, while they continue to study towards their degrees and have a successful student experience in the western education system.”</p>
<p>Dr Petelo says one of the main aims of the programme is to cement Lincoln’s partnerships with the two universities.</p>
<p>“Some of the international students who take part in Study Abroad will return to Lincoln for their post-graduate studies, which is fantastic, and one of the many benefits of offering the programme.”</p>
