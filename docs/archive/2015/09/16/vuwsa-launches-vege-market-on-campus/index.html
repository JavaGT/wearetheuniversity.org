<p><strong>Students rejoice as hungover weekend market trips are a thing of the past; VUWSA Launches Vege Market on Campus</strong></p>
<p>Today the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) launched the first ever midweek fruit and vege market on Kelburn Campus in a bid to improve student wellbeing.</p>
<p>“The weekly ritual of flatmates bickering over whose turn it is to make the hungover trek to the city markets is over” said VUWSA President Rick Zwaan.</p>
<p>“It’s fantastic to have cheap fresh fruit and veges available on campus to students, staff and the Kelburn community.”</p>
<p>“We know that key factors of improving students’ wellbeing, and their academic success, relate to their financial stress and if they’re eating healthy”</p>

<p>The market will run on Wednesdays from 2pm-6pm during the main university trimesters and is located in the Tim Beaglehole Courtyard, just outside the central Hub building on Kelburn Campus.</p>
<p>VUWSA’s Wellbeing and Sustainability Officer, Rory Lenihan-Ikin, organised the market in an effort to make fresh fruit and veges more readily available to students.</p>
<p>“Making it to the existing weekend markets can be challenging with many students working weekend jobs, finishing assignments or simply avoiding the trek up the hill to Kelburn carrying a week’s worth of vege.”</p>
<p>The timing of the market is designed to make it easy for students and staff to stock up before heading home, and attract other Kelburn residents onto campus.</p>
<p>“We hope that the market will add to the vibrancy of Kelburn Campus and help Victoria become a focal point for the wider Kelburn community” concludes Zwaan.</p>
