<p><strong>Thursday, 10 September 2015, 8:25 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Undue secrecy on tertiary sector rorts</strong></p>
<p>Steven Joyce’s refusal to reveal details of other tertiary institutions being investigated in the wake of the Taratahi debacle is unacceptable, says Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“Damning inquiries into Taratahi, Te Whare Wananga o Awanuiarangi and the Western Institute of Technology are already in the public arena.</p>
<p>“Today Steven Joyce confirmed that one of the six new institutions under investigation had revealed details of matters that require further enquiries. He refused to name that institution.</p>
<p>“This spate of rorts has raised serious questions about the ability of the Tertiary Education Commission and the NZQA to keep the system honest.</p>
<p>“Deloitte has made the extraordinary admission that these authorities are ‘neither designed nor resourced to detect potential fraud’.</p>
<p>“A whistle-blower has already exposed a scheme where members and staff of the Warriors Rugby League Club were awarded certificates for an 18 week course after just one day’s study.</p>
<p>“This week we had revelations that ghost students were being enrolled at the Taratahi Agricultural Training Centre. Sixty-seven tutors were enrolled in entry level courses where little or no teaching was done.</p>
<p>“At least $7.5 million in funds has been wrongly used by Taratahi and now must be paid back.</p>
<p>“Today in response to a parliamentary question, Steven Joyce ‘fessed up to $57 million which was reclaimed from the tertiary sector in 2014. That’s a big number in any one’s book.</p>
<p>“It’s time the Minister named the tertiary institutions that have been investigated, including the one that is still currently being probed by the TEC,” says David Cunliffe.</p>
