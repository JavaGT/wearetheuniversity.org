<p><strong>Pita Paraone MP</strong></p>
<p>Spokesperson for Māori Affairs<br>10 September 2015</p>
<p><strong>More Support Needed for Maori Boarding Schools</strong><br>New Zealand First is concerned Māori are being shut out of government support for education, leading to the closure of Māori boarding schools.</p>
<p>“The Minister of Education has said Turakina Māori Girls’ College will have to close if it doesn’t get more students,” says New Zealand First Māori Affairs Spokesperson Pita Paraone.</p>
<p>“Turakina is not a private school therefore Māori from low socio-economic backgrounds are predominately shut out from receiving scholarships from the Government’s Aspire scholarship programme.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First wants the government to make the scholarships available to both private and public school students.</p>
<p>“Minister after Minister are at fundraising events for private schools and organisations such as In Zone (a private trust providing boarding scholarships for Māori students to EGGS and Kings) yet the government ignores the most vulnerable Māori students.</p>
<p>“First Hato Petera, now Turakina are fighting for their existence. Changing the Aspire Scholarship criteria is the least the government can do to support Māori boarding schools and give Māori education a much needed boost,” says Mr Paraone.</p>
