<p>David Cunliffe</p>
<p>Tertiary Education spokesperson</p>
<p><strong>Joyce must explain Taratahi fiasco</strong></p>
<p>Steven Joyce must explain why a whistle-blower was needed to launch an investigation into the Taratahi Agricultural Training Centre, says Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“At least $7.5 million has been inappropriately received by Taratahi and now must be paid back.</p>
<p>&quot;The scale of Taratahi&#39;s mismanagement is large. Sixty- seven tutors were enrolled in entry level courses where little or no teaching was done.</p>
<p>“Taratahi has now been referred to the SFO and that is a necessary step.</p>
<p>“But this has been going on since 2009. Why did the accountability systems fail? Why did it take a whistle-blower to expose it?</p>
<p>“What was Taratahi’s Board doing? How was the Tertiary Education Commission’s oversight unable to pick up these rorts until now?</p>
<p>“It now raises the question of how many of the country’s 600 tertiary institutions have problems of this kind. How many have been systematically overfunded.</p>
<p>“Why did a 2015 NZQA report into Taratahi find that there were ‘no significant educational concerns with programme delivery’?</p>
<p>“The Minister needs to explain why the system failed so badly and what is going to change to ensure it does not happen again,” says David Cunliffe.</p>
