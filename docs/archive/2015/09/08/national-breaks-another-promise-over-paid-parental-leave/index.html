<p><strong>National breaks another promise over paid parental leave</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of parents of multiple babies and babies with disabilities will miss out on much-needed extra support after National broke another promise to extend their paid parental leave entitlements, Labour’s spokesperson for Women Sue Moroney says.</p>
<p>“In February my proposal to extend 26 weeks paid parental leave to these families – and those with premature babies – was voted down by ACT Leader David Seymour after National promised their bill would do the same.</p>
<p>“National today made a mug of David Seymour after the Government announced support would only be extended for premature babies from the time they are born until their due date.</p>
<p>“While this will be welcome news for those families, if ACT had been allowed to vote for my proposal in February, around 2000 families would have already had access to that support.</p>
<p>“The watered down version David Seymour has been forced into will leave an additional 1000 families each year with inadequate paid leave when they have a special needs baby or a multiple birth.</p>
<p>“This issue isn’t going away. My new Member’s Bill will be before Parliament next week and appears to have the support of the majority of Parliament to extend paid parental leave for all babies to 26 weeks.</p>
<p>“National should stop playing games and put the needs of Kiwi families first by supporting my Bill,” Sue Moroney says.</p>
