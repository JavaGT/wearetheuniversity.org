<p>3 September 2015</p>
<p>Gallagher gift to enhance Waikato University’s engineering programme</p>
<p>A significant gift from the Glenice and John Gallagher Foundation will be used to establish a new chair in engineering at the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>The Dr John Gallagher Chair in Engineering</p>
<p>The first of its kind at Waikato, the position will be known as the Dr John Gallagher Chair in Engineering in recognition of the Gallagher’s long history of support for the University.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Chair coincides with the University’s plans to expand its engineering offerings by also appointing a Dean of Engineering later this year.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley says Glenice and John Gallagher’s ongoing support will mean the University can continue to address current skills-shortages and move towards solutions for some of the world’s big problems, particularly in land-based industries.</p>
<p>“The Gallagher business has a strong connection with agriculture and has demonstrated a real commitment to retaining manufacturing in New Zealand. We are incredibly grateful for this gift, and it is hoped that the funding will be able to assist in these areas.”</p>
<p>Gallagher gift</p>
<p>Dr Gallagher says he and Glenice are proud to support forward-thinking initiatives such as the new Chair in Engineering.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to be able to contribute to the University and the region to further develop the School of Engineering,” he says.</p>
<p>“Being an engineer of the old school, I believe the whole cycle of marketing, sales, management, servicing, education, manufacturing and delivery starts when an engineer makes a product that needs all of these services to get it to the end user.</p>

<p>“When I first arrived on the university council there was no engineering school. One developed just over 10 years ago as part of the Faculty of Science and Engineering. But as it has grown, it’s now time for the school of engineering to have its own profile and fulfil the need of the next generation for a smarter way to do things.”</p>
<p>A long association</p>
<p>The Gallagher family has had a long relationship with the University of Waikato, contributing significantly in time and money to the development of the Don Llewellyn Sports Pavilion, the Sir Edmund Hillary Programme, The Academy of Performing Arts and The Great Race.</p>
<p>In 2011 the Academy of Performing Arts was renamed in honour of the Gallagher Group and family in recognition of their long term commitment to an endowment fund for the University.</p>
<p>Dr Gallagher has served on the University Council since 1990, been Pro-Chancellor and Chancellor, has been a Chairman of the University’s Foundation and is now Patron. He also has an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>The Dr John Gallagher Chair in Engineering position will be advertised this year with the incumbent starting early 2016.</p>
<p>Glenice and John Gallagher, along with Keith Gallagher (a Waikato graduate), and the Vice-Chancellor will formally sign the gift agreement at an event on September 9.</p>
