<p><strong>Thursday, 3 September 2015, 2:02 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris Bishop</strong></p>
<p><strong>National List MP based in the Hutt Valley</strong></p>
<p><strong>Media Statement</strong></p>
<p><strong>3 September 2015</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bishop opens Youth MP nomination process</strong></p>
<p>Chris Bishop, National List MP based in the Hutt Valley, has put the call out to find the next Youth MP based in the Hutt South electorate.</p>
<p>A past Youth MP himself, Bishop is searching for talented and driven young people who live in the Hutt South electorate to put themselves forward to represent young people at the 2016 Youth Parliament.</p>
<p>The successful applicant will join 120 other youth MPs selected to engage with and represent their community from January 2016 – and put their experience to practice at Youth Parliament to be held on 19-20 July 2016. Youth MPs will have the opportunity to debate legislation, sit on select committees and ask oral parliamentary questions of Ministers.</p>
<p>Mr Bishop has decided to give applicants the option of applying in writing or by video and he urges applicants to be inventive in their submission.</p>
<p>“I’m looking for applicants to write in 500 words, or to tell me in a three minute video, what they would change about the Hutt Valley to make it an even better place than it is today – with a particular focus on young people,” Mr Bishop says.</p>
<p>“Applicants should be as creative as they want. The Hutt is a great place to live, work and play – but I’m interested in their ideas as to how to improve it, particularly for young people.</p>

<p>“I was a Youth MP at Youth Parliament in 2000, so I know first-hand what a valuable experience it is. It’s important young people put their hand up and make their voice heard, and Youth Parliament is an ideal way to do this.”</p>
<p>Applications open on Monday 7th of September and will close on Friday 2nd of October. Applicants will be shortlisted for interview by Mr Bishop in Parliament after which a Youth MP will then be chosen.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the criteria for entering to be chosen as a Youth MP?</strong></p>
<p>A Youth MP is someone who is passionate about youth issues, politics and social change and is confident engaging with a wide range of people. In particular, I’m looking for a young person who is:</p>
<p>• aged 16 – 18 years old (inclusive) on 16 October 2015;</p>
<p>• resident in the Hutt South electorate;</p>
<p>• passionate about the Hutt Valley and who can articulate clearly the views of young people in the Hutt;</p>
<p>• active in their community;</p>
<p>• able to seek the views, opinions and ideas of their peers and represent them at Youth Parliament 2016; and</p>
<p>• able to attend Youth Parliament on 19 and 20 July 2016 and commit to the Youth MP tenure, from 25 January to 25 July 2016 (training sessions will be offered at the beginning of this tenure).</p>
<p>To apply to be my Youth MP, I’d like applicants to write 500 words or supply a three minute video which describe what they’d <em>change</em> about the Hutt Valley to make it an even better place than it is today – particularly for young people.</p>
<p>Applications open on Monday 7th of September and will close on Friday 2nd of October. Students can send written applications or links to their video applications directly to me at <a href="mailto:chris.bishop@parliament.govt.nz">chris.bishop@parliament.govt.nz</a>, or alternatively they can upload their videos directly to my Facebook page (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/chrisbishopMP">www.facebook.com/chrisbishopMP</a>).</p>
<p><strong>So what is Youth Parliament and why should I be involved?</strong></p>
<p>Youth Parliament is a fantastic opportunity for students aged between 16 and 18 years old with a passion for politics to get hands on experience of Parliament and all its workings!</p>
<p>Youth Parliament replicates the real Parliament as closely as possible. Youth MPs have the opportunity to debate legislation, sit on select committees and ask oral parliamentary questions of Ministers. 121 Youth MPs hold their positions for a tenure period from 25 January, 2016 to 25 July, 2016. During their tenure, Youth MPs are expected to actively engage with their community to gain an understanding of the ideas and concerns of youth in their community.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Youth Development coordinates New Zealand’s Youth Parliament and funds the travel and accommodation costs for participants outside of the Wellington region.</p>
<p>Training is provided for both Youth MPs and for the Youth Parliamentary Press Gallery ahead of them taking up their roles.</p>
