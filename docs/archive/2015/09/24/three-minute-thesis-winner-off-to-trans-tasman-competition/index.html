<p><strong>Three Minute Thesis winner off to Trans-Tasman competition</strong></p>
<p>After taking out the University of Waikato’s Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition in 2014, Onyekachi Raymond is about to head off to compete in the Trans-Tasman 3MT on 2 October.</p>
<p>From the Faculty of Science and Engineering, Raymond’s presentation is entitled “The Beauty Without the Beast: A Chemical Search for Beryllium’s Partner”. Beryllium is an indispensable but toxic metal used in high-tech devices such as smartphones and computers. Raymond’s research looks at finding chemical agents that help remove beryllium from these products when they are disposed of.</p>
<p>Raymond will have three minutes to present his research to the audience at the University of Queensland Graduate School in Brisbane.</p>
<p>Raymond, who is from Nigeria, is now two years into his PhD in Chemistry at Waikato University.</p>
<p>“I was really excited to win the 3MT in 2014 and I’m even more excited to have the opportunity to present it in Australia.”</p>
<p>As well as taking first prize worth $3000 in the 2014 competition, Raymond also won the People’s Choice Award, based on audience votes, of $500.</p>
<p>3MT, supported by Prior Blackburn and the University of Waikato Foundation, showcases research being carried out by the University’s PhD students. Presentations are judged on comprehension, engagement and communication.</p>
<p>At this year’s 3MT final, 10 PhD candidates will pitch their research to a lay audience at 7pm on 21 October in the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts Concert Chamber. Entry is free. All are welcome.</p>
