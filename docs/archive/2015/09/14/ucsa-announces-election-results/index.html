<p><strong>UCSA announces election results</strong></p>
<p><strong>14 September 2015</strong></p>
<p>James Addington has been elected president of the University of Canterbury Students’ Association in election results announced on Friday night.</p>
<p>Addington, aged 22, beat second-placed Stewart Whitehead, 1667 votes to 1289. Both are studying for law and commerce degrees.</p>
<p>Mikaela Ruegg was elected vice-president with 1690 votes, ahead of the second-placed Samantha Hampson with 1269.</p>
<p>Jacob Bignell, aged 19, was elected finance officer with 1964 votes, ahead of second-placed Tom McArdle on 960.</p>
<p>Tom Tappin, Michael Brophy, Emily Barker, Stephanie Yee, Cheyenne Conroy-Mosdell, Christopher Lamb, Chanuka De Silva, Espoire Ibouanga and John Duncan were elected to the UCSA Student Executive.</p>
<p>Returning officer Riley Divett said the student voter turnout remained typically high for UCSA elections, with 31.25% of voter turnout compared to other universities’ single digit turnout, even though the election had to be held again after some candidates were found to be ineligible.</p>
<p>Current UCSA President Sarah Platt said, “The high voter turnout reflects the strong engagement that UC students have with our university. This level of engagement is also evident by the record number of student-affiliated clubs on campus, which number 140.”</p>
<p>President-elect Addington, who is part of the UCSA Student Executive this year, said he was looking forward to the challenges ahead, including the construction of a new UCSA building.</p>
