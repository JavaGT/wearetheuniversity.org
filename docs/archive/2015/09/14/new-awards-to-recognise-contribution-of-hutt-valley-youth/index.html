<p><strong>Monday, 14 September 2015, 10:10 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>New awards to recognise outstanding contribution of Hutt Valley Youth</strong></p>
<p>Chris Bishop, National Party List MP based in the Hutt Valley, has today launched the inaugural Hutt City Youth Awards.</p>
<p>“These new awards will shine a light on the talented young people we have here in the Hutt who show huge potential for the future, and who have made a significant contribution to the city.</p>
<p>“While there are many awards ceremonies that have components recognising youth, the Hutt City Youth Awards will be the first to focus solely on the amazing things young people are doing in and for our community.”</p>
<p>“Since becoming a MP I’ve placed a real focus on engaging and supporting the young people in the Hutt – for example by initiating a new annual afternoon tea for student leaders with the Prime Minister, backing programmes like Young Enterprise and MaiBiz, and supporting local youth projects.</p>
<p>“These new awards will recognise the breadth and depth of talent of youth in the Hutt Valley with awards for leadership, entrepreneurship, science and technology, service, overcoming adversity, arts, sport, and tolerance and diversity. These categories draw on the strengths of the Hutt as a vibrant, diverse community that focuses on excellence in innovation, technology, science and community contribution.</p>
<p>“The organising committee has brought together an outstanding panel of judges, including His Worship Ray Wallace (Mayor of Lower Hutt), Sir Neville Jordan (Chancellor of Victoria University, entrepreneur, philanthropist), Kevin Goldsbury (Director of youth development charity Ignite Sport), Renee Ailao (entrepreneur and Founder of NZ Kids Food) and Courtney Johnston (Director of the Dowse Art Museum).</p>

<p>“Award recipients will be announced and honoured at a special ceremony at Boulcott’s Farm Golf Club on Thursday 3 December, in the company of family, friends and sponsors.</p>
<p>“Sponsors for the awards are now being sought – people interested in supporting the awards with financial or ‘in-kind’ support should get in touch.</p>
<p>“With support from local businesses, community organisations and industry, the Hutt City Youth Awards will provide the well-deserved recognition for Hutt youth that is currently missing from our community.</p>
