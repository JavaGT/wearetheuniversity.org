<p><strong>Long-time educators honoured at NZEI Annual Conference</strong></p>
<p>28 September 2015</p>
<p>Eight educators have been acknowledged for their outstanding contribution to quality public education and social justice.</p>
<p>The announcements were made at NZEI Annual Conference in Rotorua on Sunday (27 September).</p>
<p>“These are significant awards and acknowledge the great achievement and contribution these people have made to our education goals,” said NZEI Te Riu Roa National President Louise Green.</p>
<p>New Honorary Fellows this year include former CTU President Helen Kelly who, as well as being deeply respected for her enormous contribution to the fight for workers’ rights, has had a long and distinguished career in education unionism and activism.</p>
<p>Two more Honorary Fellows announced are Professor Martin Thrupp from Waikato University and former AEU (Australian Education Union) President Angelo Gavrielatos.</p>
<p>“Martin is one of the country’s most eminent education academics and through his work has provided a strong and rigorous analysis and commentary of the Government’s education reforms.</p>
<p>“Angelo now heads a programme for Education International working against the global privatisation of education.”</p>
<p>Three past Presidents of NZEI TE Riu Roa, Hamilton’s Hillcrest Normal School principal Irene Cooper, and former Fairfield Intermediate principal, Bill Noble, also from Hamilton as well as former Gore Main School principal Darrell Ward, have all been awarded life membership of the Institute.</p>

<p>“Life membership of NZEI Te Riu Roa acknowledges the high regard in which they are held by their colleagues and the distinguished contribution they have made to our organisation and to education.”</p>
<p>Two new NZEI Fellows have been also been named. Auckland’s May Road school principal Lynda Stuart was made a Fellow for her enormous commitment and contribution to NZEI, education, and the high regard in which she is held by her community.</p>
<p>Central Otago kindergarten teacher, Judy Hinton, has also been made a Fellow due to her long term contribution to the organisation, the huge support she has given to our members and to early childhood education.</p>
