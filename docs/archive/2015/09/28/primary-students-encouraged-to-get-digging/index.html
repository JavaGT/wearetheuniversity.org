<p><strong>Primary students encouraged to get digging</strong></p>
<p>Future soil scientists are being encouraged to keep digging by two University of Waikato experts.</p>
<p>Soil Science Professor Louis Schipper and his wife Angela, who has a primary teaching background and is a content developer at the Science Learning Hub, have been donating soil science resources to Hamilton primary schools as part of their support for the International Year of Soils.</p>
<p>The resource kits include the award winning children’s book <em>Sam and Dave Dig a Hole</em>, along with teaching activities, soil posters and stickers. Their goal is to encourage children to do as the book suggests, dig a hole – and find something spectacular.</p>
<p>The couple have collaborated on soil science resources for young people for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>They have published both print and online materials about soils and helped dig many holes at schools and on Cub Scout camps.</p>
<p>Professor Schipper says it’s enjoyable working with children and he hopes to convince them that earth sciences is an exciting study option.</p>
<p>“We want the best possible students in Earth Sciences because it can be a very challenging and rewarding field of study that attempts to determine how to wisely use the Earth’s precious resources,” he says.</p>
