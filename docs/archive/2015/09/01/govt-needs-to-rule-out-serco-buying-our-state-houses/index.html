<p><strong>Govt needs to rule out Serco buying our state houses</strong></p>
<p>Metiria Turei MP on Sunday, August 30, 2015 - 12:20</p>
<p>Thousands of state houses being placed on the asset sales block tomorrow for overseas buyers is a move that is deeply unpopular with New Zealanders, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>“That the Serco boss was here offering to buy up more state assets like housing is unacceptable and Government needs to rule out Serco as a purchaser,” Green Party Co-Leader Metiria Turei said.</p>
<p>“Serco have proven themselves incapable and cannot be trusted with the welfare of New Zealand families.</p>
<p>“The flogging off our our hard built state houses to foreign corporates is a dangerous path to go down.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders want these homes kept in New Zealand ownership.</p>
<p>“The Government needs to be building more state homes for New Zealanders, not selling the existing capacity.</p>
<p>“Government&#39;s desperation to sell them off will come at a huge cost if they sell them to a UK, Australian or overseas agency.</p>
<p>“Overseas buyers like Serco are a risk to some of our most vulnerable families, and the Government should rule at least Serco out,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
