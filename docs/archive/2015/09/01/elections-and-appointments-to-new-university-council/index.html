<p>Six positions on the new University Council (commencing 01 January 2016) will be filled by election or appointment.</p>
<p>Two positions are to be filled by election:</p>
<ul>
<li>one permanent member of the academic staff elected by permanent members of that staff</li>
<li>one permanent member of the professional staff elected by permanent members of that staff</li>
</ul>
<p>Four positions are to be filled through appointment (by the current Council) following a call for expressions of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>one person, being Māori and able to advise Council on issues relevant to Māori</li>
<li>one person being an alumnus of the University of Auckland</li>
<li>two persons able to provide skills specified by Council, to be appointed by Council.</li>
</ul>
<p>Elections for the academic and professional staff members on Council will commence later in September. A Notice of Election will be distributed through the VC Update of 23 September. Notices of Candidacy will close on 15 October 2015, and voting will commence on 4 November. This is a separate process from that applying to elections for University committees.</p>
<p>In the meantime, expressions of interest are being called for the remaining four positions. The closing date for expressions of interest is <strong>5pm on Friday 09 October</strong>.</p>
