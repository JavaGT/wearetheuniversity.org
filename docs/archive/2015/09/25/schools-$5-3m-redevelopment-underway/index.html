<p><strong>Hon Nicky Wagner</strong><br>MP for Christchurch Central</p>

<p><strong>School’s $5.3m redevelopment underway</strong></p>
<p>Christchurch MP Nicky Wagner has acknowledged the strong engagement and commitment of Avonhead School and its community as they celebrate the start of the school’s $5.3m redevelopment.</p>
<p>“It was a privilege to share this special day with Avonhead School and turn the first sod of the School’s redevelopment,” Ms Wagner says.</p>
<p>“The redevelopment includes a new teaching block of four teaching spaces for up to 100 students and will upgrade existing buildings.</p>
<p>“When this is completed, students and teachers will enjoy fantastic new facilities which support the school’s collaborative teaching practices.</p>
<p>“As with all major school redevelopments, the classrooms of yesterday are being replaced with innovative new learning spaces. These are open and flexible environments in which children will be inspired to learn in new and exciting ways.</p>
<p>“The Government immediately poured additional resources into greater Christchurch following the earthquakes and is investing $1.137 billion in school rebuilds.</p>
<p>“Greater Christchurch will have one of the most modern schooling networks in the country.</p>
<p>“It is wonderful to celebrate with Avonhead School and recognise the valuable contribution of the community who support it,” Ms Wagner says.</p>
<p>The construction at Avonhead Primary School will run until February 2017 and the school will continue to operate during that time.</p>
