<p><strong>On-Air Expletive a Sad Fact-Free Response</strong></p>
<p>Economist Shamubeel Eaqub, who cursed the New Zealand First Leader on TV One’s <em>Q&amp;A</em> today, was hopelessly out of his depth on immigration.</p>
<p>“Being an economist for a foreign-owned bank, charging the highest real interest rates in 50 years in an economic environment of consumption not production was hardly likely to qualify him as an immigration expert,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“It’s pointless using expletives to cover up lack of knowledge on a topic.</p>
<p>“He has no idea how many immigrants have come here, under what categories, into what occupations, or their demands and contributions to the state’s purse.</p>
<p>“The pity is that Mr Eaqub had not done his homework on parent reunion, the particular subject that raised his ire. Perhaps he could show us just one other country in the world that has a parent reunion entitlement to super policy as generous as New Zealand’s.</p>
<p>“New Zealand has a high rate of family reunion compared to other countries. Even Professor Paul Spoonley, who is an academic immigration expert, says ageing migrants are a serious concern.</p>
<p>“Here are the figures Mr Eaqub seems blithely unaware of. Since 2000, over 79,000 people above the age of 50 have come here to live, many from countries that have no state pension or reciprocal system.</p>
<p>“After 10 years they have become eligible for NZ Super at the age of 65.</p>
<p>“Mr Eaqub’s excuse that as their sons and daughters work here and pay taxes they are not a burden on the economy was pathetic in the extreme.</p>

<p>“Two younger people, who may themselves have a family making demands on the country’s infrastructure, will never add to the ‘fiscal’ pool anywhere near balancing the cost of NZ Super for their four parents.</p>
<p>“Alongside that he painfully disregarded the lack of a focused immigration policy to add to production and exports, and seemed to argue there was some mythical social good, the shape, character and nature of which he couldn’t explain.</p>
<p>“Based on average life expectancy the NZ Super cost is currently $480,000 per person.</p>
<p>“It’s Mr Eaqub who needs to get real, beginning with having a few facts to back up his banker’s prejudice.</p>
<p>“Or better still, insisting the opponents of his rhetoric, at least in fairness, being in the same debate.</p>
<p>“Had that happened this fact-free debate would have had a different outcome.”</p>
