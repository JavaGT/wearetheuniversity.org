<p><strong>How do we solve New Zealand’s healthcare challenges?</strong></p>
<p>One of New Zealand’s leading public health experts is calling for a move away from 20th century medical treatments.</p>
<p>Massey University’s Pro Vice-Chancellor of the College of Health Professor Paul McDonald is about to embark on a speaking tour to explain why he thinks New Zealand needs to embrace more innovative, collaborative and cost-effective solutions, using the latest scientific breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Core to his beliefs is the role society plays in our health. Professor McDonald says, “We tend to think of chronic diseases as medical problems with social consequences, but the time has come to think of chronic diseases as social problems with medical implications.”</p>
<p>In the coming years, more Kiwis will develop chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, dementia and respiratory disease. Professor McDonald says, “The cost of caring for the sick and elderly will continue to grow, as long as the focus is on adding years to life, instead of adding life and dignity to years.”</p>
<p>Professor McDonald says the biggest challenge for public health is New Zealand’s ageing population. In 2005, around one in eight New Zealanders were over the age of 65; from the late 2030s it will be around one in four.</p>
<p>Come and find out why it is time to re-think our approach to chronic diseases, and why moving away from a medical treatment model will save both money and lives.</p>
