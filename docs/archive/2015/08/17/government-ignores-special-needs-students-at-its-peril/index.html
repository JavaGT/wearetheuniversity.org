<p>Government Ignores Special Needs Students at Its Peril</p>
<p>Major cracks are emerging in the education sector as the government’s one-size-fits all approach to education leaves schools and special needs students in the lurch, says New Zealand First’s Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“Northland principals are struggling to cope with funding shortfalls as more new entrants arrive at school with extreme behavioural problems,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
<p>“Surely, when principals describe extreme cases in which five-year-olds threaten to kill the government should be taking emergency action.</p>
<p>“The government is also cutting a special needs programme in Auckland, by turning a preschool into a playgroup, and stopping funds for many of the children attending.</p>
<p>“There seems to be an attitude that schools just have to cope.</p>
<p>“Parents of special needs pre-schoolers should not be left without options when the government claims it’s simply enforcing policy when it stops schools from running preschool special needs programmes.</p>
<p>“Lack of funding for special needs and the lack of investment in activity centres and alternative education providers has created this situation and it is getting worse.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First would review the budget for Special Education to meet the needs of all students.</p>
<p>“We’d tackle the shortage of specialists in the special education sector, including psychologists and speech language therapists.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First would create professional development training for teacher aides.</p>
<p>“There are too many children in need of extra help in education who are being pushed aside, putting more pressure on schools already under financial strain.</p>
<p>“We’re heading for a dire situation in the not so distant future,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
