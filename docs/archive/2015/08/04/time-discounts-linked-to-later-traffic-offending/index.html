<p>Time-discounts on restricted driver licences linked to later traffic offending</p>
<p>Young New Zealand drivers who gain a time discount on their restricted licences for taking a defensive driving course (DDC) are more likely to be caught committing traffic offences once they are fully licensed, according to new University of Otago research.</p>
<p>The findings emerge from the New Zealand Drivers Study (NZDS), a nationwide study of 3992 newly licensed car drivers. When 1763 drivers were interviewed upon gaining their full licence, it was found that 49% had taken part in a DDC and of these 868 drivers, 748 (86%) received a time discount.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, taking a DDC or a ‘Street Talk’ course qualifies the driver for a time discount of 6 months (or 3 months for those over 24 years) during the 18-month restricted licence stage.</p>
<p>The paper was co-authored by Drs Dorothy Begg and Rebecca Brookland of the University’s Injury Prevention Research Unit and appears in the Journal of Safety Research.</p>
<p>In their paper the pair writes that prior to receiving their full licence, those in the DDC group were found to be “relatively low-risk, law-abiding young drivers who could be expected to go on and be relatively safe fully licensed drivers”.</p>
<p>Dr Begg says this included the DDC group being less likely than the others to have received a traffic offence notice or been involved in a crash while on their learner or restricted licence.</p>
<p>“However, once this group of drivers moved into the first years of their full licence, we discovered that they were 40% more likely to receive a traffic offence notice; this reducing to 10% higher after controlling for other factors that included age, gender, drug and alcohol use, and personality characteristics,” she says.</p>

<p>The most common offence amongst the group was speeding, with 46% of the time-discount group receiving at least one speed offence notice, compared with 30% of the others.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the results of this study, when viewed together with other NZ crash evidence, indicate that a time discount should not be given for completing a DDC or Street Talk course.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Drivers Study was funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand (2005–2013), the Road Safety Trust (2005–2013) and the Accident Compensation Corporation (2005–2009).</p>
