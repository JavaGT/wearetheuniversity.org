<p>The Facts on Immigration And Parent Reunion for the Uninformed</p>
<p>New Zealand First says Shamubeel Eaqub, who describes himself as an economist, should get real.</p>
<p>He was too quick in his attempt to try and insult New Zealand First on TV One’s Q&amp;A programme in a discussion on immigration.</p>
<p>“Covering up lack of knowledge by using an expletive is far from convincing,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Mr Peters.</p>
<p>“He had not done his homework.</p>
<p>“The rate of family reunion to New Zealand is high compared with other countries. Immigration expert and academic Professor Paul Spoonley says the number of ageing Chinese migrants are a serious concern.</p>
<p>“Since 2000, over 79,000 people above the age of 50 have come here to live, many from countries that have no state pension or reciprocal system.</p>
<p>“After 10 years they have become eligible for NZ Super at the age of 65.</p>
<p>“Two younger people, who may themselves have a family making demands on the country’s infrastructure, will never add to the ‘fiscal’ pool anywhere near balancing the cost of NZ Super for their four parents,” says Mr Peters.</p>
<p>“For others who are interested in doing research before publicly giving an opinion, the graphs will be informative,” says Mr Peters.</p>
