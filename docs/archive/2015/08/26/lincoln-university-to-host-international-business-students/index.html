<p><strong>Lincoln University to host international business students in new partnership</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand Institute of Business and Technology (NZIBT), a Private Training Establishment (PTE), is partnering with Lincoln University to deliver a unique educational experience for NZIBT’s international students. NZIBT will be utilising the student and teaching facilities on the Lincoln University campus to give the students a complete New Zealand learning experience.</p>
<p>Jeremy Baker, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, International and Business Development at Lincoln University, says that this initiative “is a genuine public-private partnership that will bring real benefits to all involved - including the wider Canterbury regional economy”. The joint venture will also support the newly released Canterbury International Education Destination 2025 strategy. This strategy is being driven by groups of organisations, who have signed up to an Accord, including Lincoln University, University of Canterbury and Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology. The development and implementation of this regional strategy is also supported by Education New Zealand within its Regional Partnership Programme.</p>
<p>NZIBT is committed to increasing the value of international students to New Zealand, through the provision of high-quality, relevant qualifications. John Snook, acting Campus Manager for NZIBT at Lincoln, is currently working in consultation with the Canterbury Employers’ Chamber of Commerce to ensure NZIBT graduates will exceed industry standards and will have education and training in subject areas that will support long-term skill shortage issues.</p>
<p>Launching on 28th August, and due to open on 2nd November, NZIBT will be delivering a Graduate Diploma in Business (Level 7)* to international students from around the world, with an initial focus on India. While the students will be enrolled with NZIBT, all of the courseware is under license from the Open Polytechnic of NZ. Dr Caroline Seelig, Chief Executive of the Open Polytechnic of NZ says “We’re looking at different ways of making our content available to other providers. Innovative forms of blended delivery are emerging and our learning resources provide a strong base for that model.”</p>
<p>*The NZIBT qualification is subject to NZQA approval and accreditation.</p>
