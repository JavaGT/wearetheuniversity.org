<p>Probing the past to explain explosive eruptions</p>
<p>A Victoria University of Wellington volcanologist will next week give a talk on the forensics of large-scale volcanic eruptions, following his recent election to Fellowship of the Royal Society in London—one of the highest international honours in science.</p>
<p>Professor Colin Wilson was recognised by the Royal Society for his research into volcanoes and his contribution to the understanding of explosive volcanic activity.</p>
<p>His talk, entitled ‘The forensics of catastrophe’, will explore how he and other volcanologists carry out research on large explosive eruptions.</p>
<p>Erupting volcanoes are described as one of the planet’s great natural sights. However, those in a position to be able to see a large-scale eruption are also in a position of extreme danger. Because of this, much of what we understand about these eruptions is gained from studying the geological ‘products’ of past events.</p>
<p>Professor Wilson will discuss geological forensic science and how insights into large explosive eruptions can be gained from studying rocks in the field and applying analytical techniques down to a microscopic scale.</p>
<p>Professor Wilson, who has been a Professor of Volcanology in the School of Geography, Environment and Earth Sciences at Victoria University since 2009, recently travelled to London for the Royal Society’s formal admission ceremony.</p>
<p>The Royal Society is a fellowship of many of the world’s most eminent scientists, engineers and technologists. It includes 80 Nobel Laureates and just eight of New Zealand’s current leading scientists.</p>
<p>Where: Lecture Theatre 1, Government Buildings, Pipitea Campus, Victoria University of Wellington<br>When: 6pm, Wednesday 26 August</p>
<p>If you would like to attend, please email <a href="mailto:rsvp@vuw.ac.nz">rsvp@vuw.ac.nz</a> with ‘Wilson’ in the subject line or phone 04-463 6390 by Monday 24 August.</p>
