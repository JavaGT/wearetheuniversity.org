<p><strong>NZEI welcomes special education needs Inquiry</strong></p>
<p>NZEI is welcoming the announcement of an Education and Science Select Committee Inquiry into support for students with dyslexic, dyspraxic, and autism spectrum disorders.</p>
<p>National President, Louise Green says there is a chronic shortage of support for students with special needs and schools struggle to find the resources to help these students succeed at school.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no targeted funding from the Ministry of Education to support students with dyslexia and dyspraxia.</p>
<p>&quot;This means that most schools fund extra teacher aides and other support needed from their Special Education Grants and through fund raising.</p>
<p>&quot;The Special Education Grant is insufficient in most cases to meet the needs of these students and that&#39;s why schools have to raise funds locally.</p>
<p>She says teachers, principals and support staff desperately need extra support for these children.</p>
<p>“We need more resources for professional development for teachers as well as extra funding for more teacher aides and other help such as specialised programmes.”</p>
