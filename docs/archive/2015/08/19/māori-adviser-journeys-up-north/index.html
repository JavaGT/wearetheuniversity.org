<p><strong>Māori adviser journeys up north</strong></p>
<p>Senior Future Student Adviser Māori Alonzo Mason will embark on a hikoi this month to promote tertiary study to Māori students. He will be working with recruitment staff from other universities to talk about tertiary study options in Northland secondary schools.</p>
<p>Hikoi translates to journey and Alonzo’s journey sees him visiting up to three schools a day with staff from AUT, Massey University, and the University of Auckland, delivering presentations to school students in a collaborative approach.</p>
<p>From Monday 24 August to Friday 27 August, the group will visit Northland College, Okaihau College, TKKM O Kaikohe, Opononi Area School, Broadwood Area School, Kaitaia College, Abundant Life, Te Rangi Aniwaniwa, Taipa Bay Area School, Whangāroa College, and Kerikeri High School.</p>
<p>Alonzo says working with other universities in recruitment is uncommon but he believes this approach aligns best with Māori culture and practice.</p>
<p>“It’s best to work together when recruiting Māori students because it’s not about which university they choose but rather that they are aware of all their study options,” he says.</p>
<p>Alonzo will be the only male in the team and will speak on behalf of the recruitment group at pōwhiri and other welcoming ceremonies the schools hold.</p>
<p>In September, Alonzo will return to several of the Northland schools to provide one-on-one consultations and help prospective students plan their courses.</p>
<p>“It will be a good opportunity to sit down with the students and help them make decisions about future study,” he says.</p>
