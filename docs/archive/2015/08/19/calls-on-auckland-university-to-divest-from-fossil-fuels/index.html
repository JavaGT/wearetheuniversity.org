<p><strong>Wednesday, 19 August 2015, 7:40 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Fossil_Free_Auckland">Fossil Free Auckland</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Students call on University of Auckland to divest from fossil fuels to avoid reputational damage</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHO:</strong> Student group Fossil Free UoA, over 2000 students, staff and alumni who have signed a petition.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT:</strong> Debate on fossil fuel divestment attracting hundreds of students, as part of campaign to get the university to establish an ethical investment policy and divest from fossil fuel extraction. Tomorrow the debate will showcase the robust arguments for divestment, and the reputational risks posed to the University of Auckland falling behind Australian universities and leading NZ universities.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE:</strong> University of Auckland Engineering Building, building 401, room 401. 20 Symonds Street, CBD, Auckland.</p>
<p><strong>WHEN:</strong> 6pm, Wednesday 19th August. Debate will last one and a half hours.</p>
<p><strong>WHY:</strong> The University of Auckland has fallen behind industry leaders in Australasia by not taking environmental considerations into account in its financial investments. Students are demanding the University fulfill its ethical imperative not to contribute to climate change by investing in the fossil fuel industry.</p>
<p><strong>DETAILS:</strong> The debate features top debaters from student group Fossil Free UoA and The University of Auckland Debating Society debating the effects and the ethics of divestment. It is part of a wider campaign by students and staff to raise awareness of the issue of divestment and lobby the University administration to pursue it.</p>
