<p><strong>Student presidents protest frozen opportunity</strong></p>
<p>The presidents representing hundreds of thousands of students today converged on Parliament to protest the Government’s 25% cut to the number of students receiving allowances.</p>

<p>The presidents presented a solid block of ice with an academic cap in it to symbolise frozen opportunity in New Zealand.</p>
<p>NZUSA President Rory McCourt says the Government’s decision to freeze the parental income threshold had pushed the children of middle and low-income families</p>

<p><em>Grant Robertson addresses the crowd</em></p>
<p>“For the 6,000 students who stopped getting allowances in the last four years, they’re at least $2,000 a year worse off – most worse.”</p>
<p>Auckland University Students’ Association President Paul Smith says the change is a cold and heartless move. “A pay rise for mum and dad has become a pay cut for students.”</p>

<p>Massey University Student’s Association President Linsey Higgins says the mounting evidence of the impact of debt on graduate life choices meant parents and grandparents were starting to wonder at the sustainability of the loans scheme.</p>

<p>“We’re leaving this here for Steven Joyce. He’s frozen opportunity. He needs to stop being so chill.”</p>
<p>Association of Students at UCOL Jessa McIntyre-Taylor says support for parents who are students needs to rise. She says too many were working to make ends meet. The NZUSA Income and Expenditure Survey shows average working hours rising from 12 to 14 hours per week over the last four years.</p>
<p>Byron Brooks, Albany Students’ Association President, says means testing allowances doesn’t take into account the variability of student and parental circumstances. He says the research behind the change was insufficient.</p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association Welfare Vice President Madeleine Ashton-Martyn says “the minister must recognize that these decisions have a very real and very tangible effect that freeze out young people from higher education”.</p>
