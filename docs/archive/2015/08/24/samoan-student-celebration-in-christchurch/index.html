<p><strong>Samoan student celebration in Christchurch</strong></p>
<p>Hundreds of Samoan university students arrive in Christchurch this week for six days of competitions and celebration of Samoan culture.</p>
<p>So’otaga 2015 will run from 28 August to 2 September and feature academic, cultural and sporting competitions and a Christian rally.</p>
<p>University of Canterbury Samoan Students’ Association (CUSSA) president, Tumama Tu’ulua says the Christchurch event is the biggest ever gathering of university Samoan student associations from across New Zealand.</p>
<p>The 35th conference will draw students from Victoria University of Wellington, Waikato University, Auckland University, AUT and the University of Canterbury, which is hosting this year’s event for the first time since 2010.</p>
<p>“Usually around 130 students participate, but this year we are expecting more than 22O students – I think they are attracted by the opportunity to visit the South Island and see what Christchurch has to offer,” says Tumama.</p>
<p>Tumama says the event is a life-changing experience for many Samoan students – especially South Islanders.</p>
<p>“Auckland has a big Pacific population and major events like Polyfest, but for many Samoan students from Christchurch, this is their first opportunity to perform at that level. The scale is pretty amazing for us – and a great learning opportunity.</p>
<p>“Competition is intense – especially in the cultural category, but I really hope UC can win at least one of the competitions,” says Tumama.</p>

<p>Tumama says assistance from UC has been great, with accommodation provided in the Rochester and Rutherford Halls of Residence and support from the wider campus with fundraising activities during the year.</p>
<p>“It’s quite a challenge providing food, accommodation and entertainment for so many people, but it all seems to be coming together. I really hope our local community comes out and supports the events.”</p>
<p>Most activities are open to the public, including volleyball and netball games at Cowles Stadium on 1 September, the debating, speeches and visual art presentations on the UC campus on Saturday 29 August and the cultural competitions at the Aurora Centre. Tickets for the Cultural Night on 31 August cost $5.00 (plus booking fee) and are available online from Eventopia – all other events are free. A detailed schedule is on the UCSA website<a href="http://ucsa.org.nz/events/sootaga/">http://ucsa.org.nz/events/sootaga/</a></p>
<p>Tumama says Samoan students from five Universities coming together is a big deal.</p>
<p>“It’s about celebrating Samoan culture and being with other young Samoan people who know what it’s like balancing student life with being Samoan.”</p>
