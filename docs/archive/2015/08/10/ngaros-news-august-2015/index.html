<p><strong>Ngaro&#39;s News: August 2015</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to my August Newsletter.</p>
<p>Last month we saw a number of important policies come into effect on 1 July that will help families and put more money back in people’s pockets. All children under 13 now have access to free GP visits and prescriptions. That’s more than 750,000 kids. In the Waitemata DHB area, around 98,000 children under the age of 13 will qualify for this. <strong><a href="http://nationalleadersoffice.cmail2.com/t/i-l-jdirkid-jtyhkkdti-r/">Click here for more information.</a></strong></p>
<p>Families will also benefit from an increase in paid parental leave and there is more assistance for solo parents who are studying. If you own a car you could pay up to $130 less a year to register a petrol model. For owners of diesel cars the saving is even greater – up to $170 a year. These are just a few of the policies National has introduced to support families. <strong><a href="http://nationalleadersoffice.cmail2.com/t/i-l-jdirkid-jtyhkkdti-j/">Read more about this here.</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://nationalleadersoffice.cmail2.com/t/i-l-jdirkid-jtyhkkdti-t/">Our government also announced new classrooms for Te Atatū Intermediate, Peninsula Primary School, and Henderson South School</a><a href="http://nationalleadersoffice.cmail2.com/t/i-l-jdirkid-jtyhkkdti-i/">.</a></strong> I was also very happy to see that 79 per cent of kids are passing NCEA Level 2 in Te Atatū. <strong><a href="http://nationalleadersoffice.cmail2.com/t/i-l-jdirkid-jtyhkkdti-d/">Read more about that here.</a></strong></p>

<p>In Parliament we celebrated the success of one of our local westies, Mary Ama, an awardee of the Access Community Awards. Mary runs a great programme at Springhill Corrections Facility using her artistic and cultural skills in the rehabilitation of prisoners.</p>
<p>In the second week I was honoured to travel with the Prime Minister and several Parliamentary colleagues to Samoa to witness the historic All Blacks vs Manu Samoa test match – an awesome display of sportsmanship, hospitality and culture right from the Faleolo Airport to Parliament House at Mulinu’u, to Apia Park, and up at Vailima, Robert Louis Stevenson estate. Samoa were great hosts!</p>
<p>From the sweltering heat of 31 degrees we flew back into Auckland’s wintry 10 degrees, and I went straight into a speaking engagement <strong><a href="http://nationalleadersoffice.cmail2.com/t/i-l-jdirkid-jtyhkkdti-h/">at the Aotearoa Literacy Conference</a></strong> and having morning tea at Te Atatū United church with our elders and community leaders. It was good to talk and listen to their views on a number of issues. I ended the month with a visit to my old school, Henderson High School, with Hon Bill English and met with students, and principal Mike Purcell. I am really proud of the excellent progress being made there. Congratulations to Mr Purcell, students, teachers, parents and Board of Trustees.</p>
