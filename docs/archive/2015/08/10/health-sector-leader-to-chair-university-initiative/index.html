<p>Health sector leader to chair University initiative</p>
<p>One of New Zealand’s most experienced health sector leaders, Professor Gregor Coster, will chair initiatives at Victoria University of Wellington focused on improving health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>Professor Coster, who has extensive experience in academic leadership, health practice and governance, will lead development of one of Victoria’s eight areas of distinctive emphasis—improving health and wellbeing in our communities.</p>
<p>Under this theme, Victoria will use its multidisciplinary capabilities to undertake targeted research into specific health issues affecting New Zealand, offer specialised health and wellbeing courses and forge partnerships with other organisations to advance health and wellbeing initiatives.</p>
<p>Professor Coster, who has a Master of Science (Hons) in physical chemistry and a PhD in public policy from Victoria University, is a former Professor of General Practice and Dean of Graduate Studies at the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>He has served on five Crown Agency governance boards over the past 15 years and currently chairs the WorkSafe New Zealand Board and is a member of the Accident Compensation Corporation Board.</p>
<p>Professor Coster has also chaired two district health boards, most recently the Counties Manukau District Health Board where he led significant reforms in health care service delivery, and been deputy chair of Pharmac.</p>
<p>In addition, he is a general practitioner with 33 years of professional experience.</p>

<p>Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Grant Guilford says Victoria will benefit greatly from having someone of Professor Coster’s calibre and international standing leading an important area of academic distinctiveness for the University.</p>
<p>“Professor Coster’s strong leadership experience and extensive health networks make him an ideal person to help Victoria maximise benefits for New Zealand from the unique translational research and innovative teaching opportunities we offer.</p>
<p>“He has deep roots at Victoria University and in the capital city, and his appointment will contribute to Victoria achieving its goal of being a world-leading capital city university and one of the great global-civic universities.”</p>
<p>Professor Coster says he is delighted to be able to assist Victoria University. “Victoria University has a unique opportunity to develop its role as a capital city university in the areas of health, social care and policy through the Improving Health and Wellbeing in Communities Theme. I look forward to working with staff across the University on this exciting project.”</p>
<p>Victoria’s areas of distinctiveness are multidisciplinary and university-wide and aim to contribute to local, national and global challenges, with a particular emphasis on Wellington, New Zealand and the wider Asia-Pacific region. The eight themes are:</p>
<p>advancing better government<br>cultivating creating capital<br>spearheading our digital futures<br>enabling our Asia-Pacific trading nation<br>stimulating a design-led, high-value manufacturing region<br>enhancing the resilience and sustainability of our natural heritage and capital<br>improving health and wellbeing in our communities<br>enriching national culture, civic society and global citizenship</p>
