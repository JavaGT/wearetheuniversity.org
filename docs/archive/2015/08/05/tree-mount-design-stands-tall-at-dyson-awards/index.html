<p>A pre-built foundation for back yard tree houses has won a School of Design graduate, Jason Khoo, the top prize in the New Zealand section of the 15th James Dyson Award.</p>
<p>The global product design competition celebrates, encourages and inspires the next generation of design engineers.</p>
<p>Mr Khoo’s design for a tree house that can be easily mounted without having to use traditional building methods was awarded the top prize ahead of two other finalists - also graduates of the school, which is part of Massey’s College of Creative Arts.</p>
<p>Head judge, Mike Jensen, says the decision was unanimous to award Mr Khoo the $5200 prize for a design that challenged current culture by encouraging more outdoor play and adventure for children.</p>
<p>“In a current environment where we have so much digital distraction, this is a welcome break for parents and kids.”</p>
<p>Other finalists were fellow industrial design graduates Emma Warren, who designed sustainable woolly shoes without using glue, and Philip Leyton, who designed a modified protective bike helmet.</p>
<p>Mr Khoo’s design, called Tree Mount, eliminates the need for a permanent attachment when building a tree house allowing it to be relocated. The bracket mount is supplied, while families can create their own designs and source tree house materials.</p>

<p>“I spent my childhood riding bikes and climbing trees,” Mr Khoo, 24, says. “ Now society is too busy and technology is limiting self-time. I hope Tree Mount will counter this by giving people a purpose for taking time out to enjoy nature, use their creative minds and build something with their hands.”</p>
<p>I’m really interested in how design can utilise new technologies for products that can be used in nature, while still retaining a level of craftsmanship.”</p>
<p>While Mr Khoo has created a full sized model, Tree Mount is at concept stage only and has not yet been commercialised.</p>
<p>His design and two runner-up product entries will be eligible in November for the international James Dyson Award worth NZ$67,000 plus another NZ$11,000 for the winning designer’s university.</p>
<p>Head of Massey’s School of Design, Rodney Adank, says the fact all three finalists are design graduates from the College of Creative Arts is further evidence of the quality and relevance of the university’s programmes.</p>
<p>“These three graduates display a breadth of talent, creative thinking and ability to transform ideas into new and innovative realities. In their process they test and interrogate designs, materials and ideas. And in consequence they provide a safer, more sustainable and playful world that enhances the quality of our daily lives. We are immensely proud of their achievements!&quot;</p>
