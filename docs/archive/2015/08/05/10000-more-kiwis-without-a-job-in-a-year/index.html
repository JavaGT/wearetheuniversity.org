<p>10,000 more Kiwis without a job in a year</p>
<p>National’s complacent approach to the economy has seen 10,000 more Kiwis unemployed compared to last year, says Labour’s Finance spokesperson Grant Robertson.</p>
<p>“Today’s unemployment figures show that there are now 148,000 New Zealanders out of work, 10,000 more than this time last year.</p>
<p>“These are not just numbers. That is an extra 10,000 people and their families who are struggling to find the work and income they desperately need.</p>
<p>“National’s Budget hopefully predicts an ongoing fall in unemployment in the next five years. That’s been proven wrong already. Employment growth needs to keep pace with population growth and migration, and it isn’t.</p>
<p>“National seems content to let the economy drift along, despite economists openly raising the prospect of recession. From ‘rock star’ to recession in six months shows how much of a mirage the much-trumpeted growth figures have been.</p>
<p>“Global dairy prices plummeted yet again this morning and ANZ’s commodity index had its biggest monthly dive ever yesterday and is the lowest it has been for six years.</p>
<p>“National has squandered opportunities to support genuine regional economic growth by adding value to local industries and supporting the growth of new ones.</p>
<p>“John Key and Steven Joyce have simply been content to bask in the glory of high commodity prices and lean on the Canterbury re-build.</p>
<p>“It was never good enough, and now the ‘rock-star’ economy is on the skids they are simply in denial. The 10,000 more Kiwis trying to get a job deserve better,” Grant Robertson said.<br>ends</p>
