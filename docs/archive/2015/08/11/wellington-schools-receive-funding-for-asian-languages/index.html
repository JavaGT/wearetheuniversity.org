<p><strong>Wellington schools receive funding for Asian languages</strong></p>
<p>National List MP based in Wellington Central, Paul Foster-Bell, says it’s important for our next generation to be able to communicate and work in different languages as our international and trading links grow – particularly within the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>“Wellington High School and South Wellington Intermediate are part of a group of schools who have been given a total of $90,146 to enable more classes in Japanese and Mandarin as part of the Asian Language Learning in Schools fund,” Foster-Bell said.</p>
<p>“Our local schools are among 22 groups of 129 schools which have received funding from the first round of the $10 million contestable fund over three years. The aim of the fund is to increase the provision of Asian languages in our schools.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see our local schools will be working together to enhance the way their students learn and develop their language skills.</p>
<p>“We are a trading nation, so it’s important our future workforce have the opportunity to learn another language and understand another culture.</p>
<p>“There are also strong cognitive benefits to learning a second language,” Foster-Bell said.</p>
<p>The programmes will begin next year. Applications for the second funding round are now open, schools have until 25 September to register their interest.</p>
