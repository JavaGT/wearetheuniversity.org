<p>Profit Before People Agenda Hits Again</p>
<p>More jobs are being cut at New Zealand Post because the government continues to put profit before people, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“State-Owned Enterprises have a social responsibility to do good for the community but it’s clear the National Government has pushed NZ Post away from this important objective,” says Spokesperson for State-Owned Enterprises Richard Prosser.</p>
<p>“The loss of 70 jobs in Canterbury is going to have a wide-ranging impact not only on 70 families but the entire region.</p>
<p>“This is bad news for those working hard to rejuvenate and rebuild Christchurch city after the earthquakes.</p>
<p>“The suggestion that 40 of those jobs are being relocated to Auckland, to an already over-crowded, over-priced city is ludicrous.</p>
<p>“Auckland doesn’t need more residents – we need to keep these jobs in the regions.</p>
<p>“Since 2013, more than 400 people around the country have lost their jobs at New Zealand Post in the wake of the government’s blind pursuit of a surplus. It has to stop.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First believes that State-owned enterprises should be good for the community, the regions and the economy,” says Mr Prosser.</p>
