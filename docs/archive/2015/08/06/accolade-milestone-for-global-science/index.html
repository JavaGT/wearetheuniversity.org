<p>Accolade milestone for global science</p>
<p>Research and education relationships between New Zealand and China continue to grow with the appointment of Professor Charles Brennan, Director of Lincoln University Postgraduate School, as a chair Professor at South China University of Technology in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>“Collaboration between New Zealand and China are essential for the globalisation of research and education,” Professor Brennan said on receiving the accolade. “For the last five to 10 years we have been working closely with colleagues in many different universities across China around food science, food safety and value adding to the food industry. I am honoured and privileged to have been appointed as a Professor at South China University of Technology and look forward to the exchange of research ideas and experiences.”</p>
<p>Lincoln’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor - International and Business Development, Jeremy Baker, says the appointment is a strong fit with Lincoln’s focus on deepening its relationships with key partners in China and other global universities. “It aligns with and supports our three-fold mission to address major global challenges – to help feed the world, protect the future, and help people live well.”</p>
<p>The appointment will see Professor Brennan co-supervise research projects and students with fellow South China University of Technology colleagues in the School of Light Engineering and Food Science. The collaborative link follows the establishment of a government sponsored New Zealand food innovation pilot plant next to the university’s food science facilities. Professor Brennan says it is a step that sees Lincoln University being recognised as the home of Food Innovation in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Professor Xin-An Zeng (Director of Food Science), speaking on behalf of Professor Wang Yingjun - President of South China University of Technology, says, “This co-operation with Professor Brennan and Lincoln University marks an important occasion in the relationships between our two countries. I think the co-operation with South China University of Technology will advance the research of both universities and countries and cultivate global scientists who can lead change in the areas of food science and technology. We are proud to have Charles as our newly appointed chair professor.”</p>
<p>Professor Charles Brennan received the appointment whilst visiting China and attending an international science meeting to deliver a key note speech on “The modulation of obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease through novel food engineering and science solutions”.</p>
