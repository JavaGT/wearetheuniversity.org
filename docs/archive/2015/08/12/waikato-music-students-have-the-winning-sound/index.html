<p><strong>Waikato Music Students Have the Winning Sound</strong></p>
<p>The University of Waikato’s Conservatorium of Music is bursting with talent, talent that continues to be recognised on a national and regional scale. Two of its young sopranos, Madison Nonoa and Blaire White, have taken out top spots at recent music competitions.</p>
<p>Ms Nonoa has won the Dame Malvina Major Foundation Christchurch Aria. The Hamilton-based singer took out the $5000 first prize ahead of a strong group of finalists. Second place was awarded to Chelsea Dolman, with Eliza Boom in third place. All three have studied with Dame Malvina at the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>The Dame Malvina Major Foundation Christchurch Aria is the first of the 2015 regional Dame Malvina Major Foundation Aria Competitions that lead into the New Zealand Aria Competition, held later in the year. The Dame Malvina Major Foundation was established in 1991 to enable Dame Malvina’s vision to “share the dream” with talented young performers.</p>
<p>Ms White also won two prizes at the recent Hamilton Singing Competitions. She won the Norah Howell Premier Recital and received a prize of $2500, as well as the Waikato Young Singer Award, worth $1500, which was based on a prior audition and interview the day before.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Singing Competitions are an annual event designed to give young performers the opportunity to gain confidence in a supportive environment and to realise and improve their talents through constructive feedback.</p>
<p>Conservatorium of Music Convenor Mike Williams is proud of the young singers’ achievements.</p>
<p>“We have an extremely strong vocal programme at the Conservatorium of Music and it is with a great deal of pride that we can boast consistent national and international success with our wonderful students,” he says.</p>
<p>“Our vocal staff have all had stellar careers in their own right and are able to pass on a wealth of experience to the vocal stars of tomorrow.”</p>
