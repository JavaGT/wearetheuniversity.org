<p><strong>Wednesday, August 12, 2015</strong><br><strong>Massey University lecturer honoured for contribution to the Dairy Industry</strong></p>
<p>School of Food and Nutrition senior lecturer Rod Bennett has been awarded the New Zealand Institute of Food Science and Technology Distinguished Service Award for the Dairy Industry.</p>
<p>The award was made in recognition of Rod’s 19 year contribution to the Dairy Industry/Fonterra Graduate Training Programme that has seen hundreds of students awarded the Master of Dairy Science and Technology, with many going on to highly successful and illustrious careers.</p>
<p>Rod Bennett says it is an honour to be given the award. “I’m chuffed. I have worked with a lot of good people in my career, and it’s very satisfying to see former students succeed in theirs.”</p>
<p>More than 55 people nominated Rod for the award, including graduates and supporting personnel of the Dairy Graduate Technical Programme.</p>
<p>Among mention, was the value Rod added to the programme, with fellow staff and students saying he is a “highly supportive and knowledgeable figure, who can be relied on for support and guidance”.</p>
<p>The award recognises long and exceptional service and/or contribution to a food industry sector in a scientific, technical, teaching, marketing or managerial role, and is specifically for industry personnel approaching or in retirement.</p>
