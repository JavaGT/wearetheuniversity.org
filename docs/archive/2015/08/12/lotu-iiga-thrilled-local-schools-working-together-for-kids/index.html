<p>Hon Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga</p>
<p>MP for Maungakiekie</p>
<p>12 August 2015</p>
<p>Lotu-Iiga thrilled local schools working together for kids</p>
<p>Six schools in the Maungakiekie electorate are part of a group of 11 schools forming the Manaiakalani Community of Schools.</p>
<p>Panmure Bridge School, Pt England School, Ruapotaka School, St Patricks School (Panmure), Sommerville School and Tamaki Primary School join five other schools to form the latest Community of Schools in the area.</p>
<p>“This means children will benefit from shared teaching practices and expertise, with teachers working alongside each other on goals to help improve educational outcomes in the classroom,” Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
<p>“I’m proud our schools are working together to achieve even more for our kids.”</p>
<p>These schools add to the Communities of Schools already participating in the government’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative. There are now 42, involving more than 330 schools.</p>
<p>In April One Tree Hill College, Bailey Road School, Ellerslie School, Panmure District School, Stanhope Road School and Sylvia Park School became part of the One Tree Hill Community of Schools.</p>
<p>“Evidence shows us quality of education and school leadership are the two most important factors in a child’s education, so we are supporting those areas, Mr Lotu-Iiga says</p>
<p>“We want to see greater collaboration among schools, improved transition through the education system for children and better career pathways for early childhood and primary teachers.</p>
<p>“National is focused on improving education and achievement in our schools so all kids have the best learning opportunities and go on to live successful lives,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
