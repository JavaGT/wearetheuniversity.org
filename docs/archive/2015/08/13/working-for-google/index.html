<p><strong>Working for Google</strong></p>
<p>A University of Waikato computer science student has landed a fully-paid summer internship with Google’s Sydney office.</p>
<p>Computer Science and Biology student Jojo Stewart will spend 12 weeks being mentored by a Google engineer and will work with a team of fellow interns to enhance her coding capabilities and learn new programming languages.</p>
<p>“It still hasn’t really sunk in - Google is actually paying me to go and work for them. I can’t wait to learn from the experts,” says Jojo.</p>
<p>She found out about this opportunity from a Google employee she met at a Waikato University event earlier this year. The internship programme is designed to promote diversity, an idea she supports.</p>
<p>“Computer science is very male dominated. It’s a shame, because I don’t think females get the same opportunities at school when it comes to computer science.”</p>
<p>Having had an interest in computers from a young age, Jojo hopes to one day find a way to combine computer science and biology, possibly with a career in medical imaging.</p>
<p>Jojo became interested in computer science in her final year at Waikato Diocesan when she completed a STAR computer science course at the University of Waikato. She then took the undergraduate computer science scholarship exam and was awarded one for her high results.</p>
<p>Now in her second year of study, Jojo hopes to encourage other young women to pursue a career in computer sciences.</p>
<p>She is working with her tutor Nilesh Kanji to increase female awareness of computer science in New Zealand. On Friday afternoons, the duo tutor a club called the IT Girls, made up of students from Waikato Dio.</p>
<p>“It would be great to see more young women in the computer labs in the future.”</p>
