<p><strong>Conservatorium of Music Presents Lehár Spectacular</strong></p>
<p>The music of Franz Lehár will be brought to life this month when the University of Waikato’s Conservatorium of Music holds its annual opera production.</p>
<p>Lehár Spectacular will feature an assortment of songs from <em>The Merry Widow</em> through to <em>The Count of Luxembourg</em> and <em>The Land of Smiles</em> and audiences can revel in the waltzes, mazurkas and can-cans of Lehár’s expansive music.</p>
<p>A highlight of the Conservatorium’s concert season, and previous opera productions including Mozart’s <em>The Magic Flute</em> and Bizet’s <em>Carmen,</em> have been performed to sell-out audiences.</p>
<p>With musical direction by Dame Malvina Major and David Griffiths, this production features vocal students as chorus-members and soloists accompanied by the University Chamber orchestra made up of instrumental students and members of the community.</p>
<p>“The programming of this year’s opera was intended as a special tribute to Ian and Agi Graham, as thanks for their generous support and financial contribution to the Conservatorium of Music. What makes this production even more special is the fact that Agi Graham is also a direct descendant of Franz Lehár,” says Mr Griffiths.</p>
<p>Among the vocal soloists will be vocal competition winners, New Zealand Opera emerging artists and Hillary Scholar sopranos Blaire White, Madison Nonoa and Eliza Boom, as well as 2015 University Aria Competition winner tenor Filipe Manu.</p>
<p>Special guest conductor Adam Maha returns from London to pick up the baton for the production. A Conservatorium graduate and former Hillary Scholar, Mr Maha was the 2012 University Blues Award recipient of the Pou Ahurea award for ‘Māori Person of the Year’.</p>
