<p><strong>Law student awarded top Danish scholarship</strong></p>
<p>Waikato University&#39;s Sam Lusk has been granted a $62,000 Danish government scholarship to complete a Master in Law at Copenhagen University in Denmark.</p>
<p>The honours student has lived in Denmark before on a student exchange and he can&#39;t wait to go back.</p>
<p>&quot;Denmark is a wonderful place to live. It&#39;s one of the happiest countries in the world and you certainly notice this in day-to-day life,&quot; says Sam.</p>
<p>The scholarship is awarded to international students who display academic excellence and covers all tuition fees for 22 months and a monthly allowance.</p>
<p>Sam was also awarded a Jonas Thomsen Sekyere Scholarship to live at Regensen College.</p>
<p>&quot;Founded in the 1623, Regensen is one of the oldest residential colleges for students studying at the University of Copenhagen and it&#39;s right in the city centre,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Sam is no stranger to overseas travel, having previously lived in the Guatemala&#39;s western highlands with indigenous Tz&#39;utujil people to learn Spanish. He says it&#39;s one of the most peaceful and naturally beautiful parts of the world.</p>
<p>Originally from Auckland, Sam admits the life and culture we have in New Zealand is great and that he&#39;ll likely return home after his studies.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to contribute to New Zealand in my future career and my family is here so I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll feel a pull to come home.&quot;</p>
<p>Sam is thankful for the support he&#39;s received from the Faculty of Law and staff at Waikato University.</p>
<p>&quot;The Faculty provides a rigorous yet supportive academic environment that goes further than simply fulfilling the traditional essentials of a law degree. The staff work really hard to promote a strong community culture.&quot;</p>
<p>Sam hopes other young people can find their passions in law but admits it takes hard work and dedication.</p>
<p>&quot;Law can be a struggle. Setting short term goals helped get me through without feeling too overwhelmed by the workload. A lot of it comes down to trial and error, sometimes we fail but this can be used to our advantage.&quot;</p>
