<p><strong>Drastic Plastic: Students swipe credit cards, use loan sharks to survive</strong></p>
<p>There’s been a 56% rise in the number of students with credit card debt, the latest Tertiary Student Income and Expenditure Survey released today reveals.</p>
<p>28% of the 5,000 students from across New Zealand who completed the survey admit they have credit card debt, up from just 18 per cent in 2010.</p>
<p>The amount of credit card debt is also on the rise; jumping from $500 in 2010 to $1,771 in 2014 – the highest it has ever been in the 30-year long survey.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Union of Students’ Association president Rory McCourt says students are turning to credit cards, often with punishing interest rates, just to pay the bills.</p>
<p>Kelly Coppin, 22, is a finance student attending Massey University extramurally. She says her $800 credit card debt is just part and parcel of being a student in 2015.</p>
<p>“I have $2000 in overdraft debt, and another $800 in credit card debt. I decided to study after 5 years as a full time worker. I&#39;ve gone from earning $450 a week, to being only able to borrow $170 a week from my living costs. I have $50 a week for food and bills. Being a student in this country is a lovely idea, but a very poor reality.”</p>
<p>The Survey Report also reveals that “Student financial advisers are increasingly reporting that students are getting into difficulty with loan sharks as they grapple with immediate and unaffordable expenses.”</p>
<p>58.5% of survey respondents had two or more forms of debt – including to the Government.</p>
<p>The spike in credit card debt will be a concern for many debt-wary New Zealanders, says Rory McCourt, who are beginning to wonder whether the Government is on top of student debt, or if students should receive a guaranteed income in an effort to curb the ballooning public and private debt.</p>
