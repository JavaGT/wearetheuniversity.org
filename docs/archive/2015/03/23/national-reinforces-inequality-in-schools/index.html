<p>National reinforces inequality in schools  </p>
<p>The National Government’s flagship programme Investing in Educational Success is clearly reinforcing inequality in the school system, Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>“The analysis released today by the NZEI clearly shows schools in wealthier suburbs are the main beneficiaries of National’s ‘expert teacher’ plans.</p>
<p>“John Key and Hekia Parata claimed their expert teacher plan was all about raising achievement amongst the most disadvantaged students, yet the cold hard reality is they are being left behind yet again.</p>
<p>“Paying big bonuses to teachers and principals in high decile schools won’t do anything to help the schools which are really struggling.</p>
<p>“If National is really serious about achieving success for every student they should be investing in the areas we already know make a real difference. They could start by boosting funding for special education – those are often the kids who are getting left behind.</p>
<p>“Labour has said from the outset that we will support programmes that genuinely raise student achievement and target the most disadvantaged. Clearly the expert teacher plan fails on both counts,” Chris Hipkins says.</p>
