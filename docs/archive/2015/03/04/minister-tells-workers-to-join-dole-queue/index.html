<p>Minister tells workers to join dole queue</p>
<p>Comments by the Workplace Relations and Safety Minister show the Government would rather subsidise bad employers than ban unfair zero hour contracts, Labour’s spokesperson for Labour Issues Iain Lees-Galloway says.</p>
<p>“Michael Woodhouse’s suggestion that those struggling to pay the bills on zero hour contracts should go to Work and Income for help are astonishing.</p>
<p>“It is surprising to hear a National Minister encouraging people to go on the dole. And it is appalling he doesn’t know there is a stand down for a benefit.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe Michael Woodhouse should have checked with his Prime Minister and the Social Development Minister Anne Tolley first.</p>
<p>“The Government should not be fobbing off these workers to welfare.</p>
<p>“Rather than doing the right thing and banning these nasty contracts, National is choosing to back bad employers.</p>
<p>“Michael Woodhouse has also shown he is completely out of touch with the real world by suggesting the thousands of workers on zero hour contracts could get another job if they don’t like the way they are being treated. Unemployment is rising and if these workers had other options, they would take them.</p>
<p>“And by the way Minister, a casual bar-tending job while you were studying accountancy is not the same as feeding a family on a zero hour contract. Maybe you should ask your officials for a briefing on the difference,” Iain Lees-Galloway suggests.</p>
