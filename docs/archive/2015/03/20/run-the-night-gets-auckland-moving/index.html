<p>Run the Night gets Auckland moving</p>
<p>Massey University is gearing up for the inaugural Run the Night event, which will be held at the Auckland Domain on March 27.</p>
<p>Billed as New Zealand’s first ever party-themed run, it promises to offer a truly unique experience and is aimed at people aged 16 and over. This type of event has proved extremely popular overseas.</p>
<p>Massey University director of marketing and student recruitment Vasso Koutsos says it’s a chance to get Auckland moving.</p>
<p>“As principal sponsor of Run the Night, we know that this is a unique chance to get students and young people across Auckland moving and having fun. With the academic year underway for university and high school students alike, it’s a chance to have a break with friends and relax a bit,” she says.</p>
<p>“We’re looking forward to a fun-filled evening of lights, movement, and amazing music in the beautiful Auckland Domain. It’s going to be a fantastic night.”</p>
<p>Event director Scott Rice says Run the Night is a 5km “party on the move” with thousands of lights and over 100 concert-quality speakers spread across the course in the Auckland Domain.</p>
<p>Gates open at 6.30pm and the alcohol-free non-competitive run/dance starts at 8.30pm.</p>
<p>Music is integral to the event, with ticket-holders given the opportunity to have advance input into the party playlist featuring on the night. The after-party will include a 90-minute DJ set from Rhythm and Blues duo Jupiter Project.</p>
<p>The social media hashtag for the event is #runthenight and participants are encouraged to follow @MasseyUni on Instagram, and share their photos of the night. Winners will be picked every 10 minutes and can collect their prizes from the Massey stand.</p>
<p>Tickets are on sale now, with a limited run of tickets selling at $25.<br>ends</p>
