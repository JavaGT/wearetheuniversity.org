<p>McCully must be proactive on human rights with Indonesian Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Murray McCully must take a proactive stance on human rights abuses in West Papua during his meeting with the Indonesian Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>Indonesia&#39;s Foreign Minister, Retno Marsudi, is currently in New Zealand for joint ministerial talks.</p>
<p>“John Key has built the case for war by claims he is outraged about human rights abuses in Iraq, but he has been very quiet on human rights abuses in our own backyard,” said Green Party human rights spokesperson Catherine Delahunty.</p>
<p>“Where was the outrage and action when school students were shot dead in West Papua last year?</p>
<p>“New Zealand needs to do more than just raise concerns.</p>
<p>“The role of the New Zealand Government should be as a mediator in a peaceful dialogue between Indonesian and West Papuan leaders.</p>
<p>“With the election of the new Indonesian President there was talk of respecting human rights, but reports show that abuses continue to occur under this government too.</p>
<p>“McCully attended the inauguration of the new President last year, fostering close relations with Indonesia, but yet, has done nothing about the human rights violations.</p>
<p>“This Government cannot claim concern for human rights halfway around the world and do nothing when it occurs near New Zealand.</p>
<p>“If John Key’s concerns for human rights are real, we expect to see his Government publically acknowledge this in relation to West Papua as other countries have done this week,” said Ms Delahunty.</p>
