<p>Māori Party congratulates England on introducing standardised cigarette packaging</p>
<p>England has followed Ireland and Australia in passing legislation to reduce the appeal of cigarettes by introducing standardised packaging.</p>
<p>“We think it’s a fantastic victory for public health in England and we ask our Government to show the same fortitude,” says Māori Party Co-leader Marama Fox.</p>
<p>“We know how much pressure the tobacco industry are applying internationally. Aotearoa needs to show the same courage as our commonwealth cousins,” says Mrs Fox.</p>
<p>A plain packaging bill was introduced in to New Zealand’s Parliament more than two years ago by former Associate Health Minister and Māori Party Co-leader, Hon Dame Tariana Turia.</p>
<p>The passing of the legislation is delayed pending a World Trade Organisation decision on whether the Australian Government’s decision to pass plain packaging legislation breaches its trade rules.</p>
<p>Māori Party Co-leader Hon Te Ururoa Flavell says New Zealand has an international reputation for its smokefree reforms which the Māori Party is determined to uphold.</p>
<p>“The Government has committed to a Smokefree Aotearoa by 2025. If we’re going to reach this target we need to show some courage.</p>
<p>“Other countries have already shown the way – they’re not waiting for the WTO decision. We should be doing everything we can to reduce the harm of this poisonous and highly addictive substance,” says Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Health, around 5000 individuals die each year from smoking or second-hand exposure.</p>
<p>Next week, Hon Dame Tariana Turia will receive international recognition for her leadership in worldwide tobacco reform at the International Conference on Tobacco Reform.</p>
<p>“We’re extremely proud of her advocacy which has saved the lives of thousands of New Zealanders and we are committed to continuing this work,” says Mrs Fox.  </p>
