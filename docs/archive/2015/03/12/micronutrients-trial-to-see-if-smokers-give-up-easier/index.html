<p><strong>Micronutrients smoking trial to see if smokers give up easier</strong></p>
<p><strong>March 12, 2015</strong></p>
<p>A substantial University of Canterbury smoking trial has begun to see if smokers are more likely to quit if they consume micronutrients.</p>
<p>Principal investigator and doctoral student Phillipa Newton wants to find out the impact that micronutrients (vitamins, minerals and amino acids) have on quit attempts made and long-term abstinence of smoking. Her study is being supervised by psychology professors Neville Blampied and Julia Rucklidge.</p>
<p>Christchurch residents who want to stop smoking with the help of her research can visit the university’s mental health and nutrition research group’s website for more information: <a href="http://bit.ly/smokingandnutrition">http://bit.ly/smokingandnutrition</a>.</p>
<p>About a third of adults in the world are smokers. A recent Australian study that followed over 200,000 Australians found that up to two in every three smokers will die from a smoking-related illness if they continue to smoke.</p>
<p>Newton says smoking is a deadly worldwide epidemic and more than 60 percent of former Christchurch smokers have taken up smoking again since the earthquakes which has resulted in a demand for ways to help people quit smoking.</p>
<p>Despite the negative consequences of ill-health, premature death and economic cost people continue to smoke because tobacco contains the highly addictive substance nicotine.</p>
<p>”If smoking rates are going to decrease, treatment options that are safe and effective deserve to be explored. Smoking interventions need to assist smokers to make a quit-attempt and remain smoke-free long term.</p>

<p>“Previous research on addiction has shown that relapse rates and alcohol and opiate withdrawal symptoms can be reduced and psychological functioning can be improved when taking micronutrients. In 2013 I conducted a pilot smoking cessation study and found that nutritional supplements were a viable way forward to help people quit smoking.”</p>
<p>Newton has launched a much larger study to further investigate if micronutrients help people to quit smoking and stay smoke-free long term when compared to a control group taking a placebo.</p>
<p>“As part of the study I will monitor craving and withdrawal with the intention to determine whether micronutrients will decrease these symptoms making it easier to remain abstinent,” Newton says.</p>
<p>Her study is using a broad spectrum micronutrient formula that contains an array of vitamins, minerals and amino acids. These nutrients are essential for optimal brain health.</p>
<p>``Smoking is a major issue in New Zealand. It costs government over $1.5 billion a year because of early death, loss of production due to illness and smoking-related healthcare costs. Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in New Zealand accounting for around 4300 to 4600 deaths a year. Second-hand smoke is the leading environmental cause of preventable death in New Zealand and kills around 350 people a year.”</p>
