<p>Invermay petition delivered to Parliament</p>
<p>Labour’s Economic Development spokesperson David Clark handed over a 12,450 signature Save Invermay petition to Dunedin South MP Clare Curran on the steps of Parliament today.</p>
<p>“The level of support that the petition has received across New Zealand is overwhelming,” says David Clark.</p>
<p>“Over 12,000 people have signed the petition to keep Invermay in the South. They know that the Government is making the decision to shift the facility without a solid business case, and a with mounting pile of evidence against such a move.</p>
<p>“Different groups have got behind the petition. Across New Zealand sheep breeders have supported it. Across Southland and Otago residents, business owners and local councils have banded together to promote the petition. It reaches across the political divide. Everyone knows that Invermay is important for New Zealand’s export earnings,” David Clark said.</p>
<p>“The negative impact on Otago is another completely preventable symptom of this Government’s neglect of the regions. The economic case doesn’t stack up and the loss of well-paying jobs around Dunedin is treated as collateral damage,” Clare Curran said.</p>
