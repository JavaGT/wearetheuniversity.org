<p><strong>Friday, 13 March 2015, 2:02 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury_Students_Association">University of Canterbury Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>UCSA launches Advisory Group dedicated to amplifying diverse voices</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury Students’ Association (UCSA) launched its Student Well-being Advisory Group (SWAG) this week as part of an initiative to ensure all voices at the University of Canterbury are heard within the Association.</p>
<p>The Advisory Group will include up to 14 student members sought from a variety of different community groups on campus and will specifically aim to further develop diversity and inclusivity within the UCSA’s decision making.</p>
<p>UCSA President, Sarah Platt, said the group will play an important role in “increasing the diversity of student voices heard within the organisation and is a step towards creating a campus where everyone feels they can succeed and belong.”</p>
<p>“We represent students on over 20 university committees from University Council to Faculties and notably the Central Equity and Diversity Committee. It is of utmost importance that as an organisation we are relevant and inclusive of the members we seek to represent.”</p>
<p>The launch comes on the eve of Diversity Week at the University, an inaugural festival celebrating diversity within the campus community and the UCSA has played an important role in crafting the festival from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Diversity Week involves 22 events across six days and highlights hosted by the Association include a Student Art Exhibition, a World Market day and an outdoor film screening of the 2014 box office hit, Pride. The Association is working with groups from all over the University, the clubs system and local community to produce key events during the week.</p>

<p>“It’s great to have a festival like this on campus. It creates an opportunity for us to celebrate the diverse communities on campus but it also allows for the building of discussion around what kind of campus we want to have here and how we can ensure we’re creating environments where everyone feels they belong.”</p>
<p>The Association is currently seeking applications for SWAG. Applicants should visit <a href="http://www.ucsa.org.nz">www.ucsa.org.nz</a> for further information.</p>
