<p>Handling cheetahs, training giraffes and rearing emu chicks are just a few of the things keeping University of Waikato graduate April McMurtie busy in her inspiring career as a zoo keeper.</p>
<p>April’s main duty is to ensure that all the animals under her care are healthy and living a high-quality, “I prepare and feed-out diets, clean exhibits, and fulfil any behavioural needs of the animals in my care, such as walking the dingoes daily. I also provide enrichment for variability and variety and to incorporate training and conditioning into the animals’ daily lives. For example I train the giraffe to follow a target stick to their crush area for daily weights and to carry out health checks,” says April.</p>
<p>Not only does April care for the animals, she is also tasked with educating the zoo’s human visitors.</p>
<p>“I give daily talks and take visitors behind the scenes for animal encounters. I aim to empower visitors to believe in the need for a sustainable co-existence between wildlife and people.”</p>
<p>April was offered a zoo keeper position at Wellington Zoo following a Bachelor of Science (Technology) at Waikato University. She majored in Animal Behaviour and Biological Sciences and as part of the degree spent a year completing a work placement at Hamilton Zoo.</p>

<p>The former Te Awamutu College student says the work placement was essentially the beginning of her career. “By completing the placement I had both theoretical knowledge and proven perseverance, while also having an extensive background in practical, industry-specific experience.</p>
<p>Without this, I feel I would not have been able to hit the ground running in the industry as I have.”</p>
<p>For April the biggest highlight of her job is the opportunity she has been given to build incredible bonds with amazing animals such as giraffe and cheetahs. “Sharing a life with such awe inspiring animals is so humbling and so fulfilling that I couldn’t imagine myself in any other career.”</p>
