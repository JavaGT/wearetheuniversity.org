<p><strong>Tuesday, 17 March 2015, 4:13 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour promises to restore democracy in Canterbury  </p>
<p>Labour will restore democratically elected regional councillors in Canterbury by introducing a Member’s bill to Parliament this week, says Wigram MP and Labour’s spokesperson for the Environment Megan Woods.</p>
<p>“Nick Smith is finally releasing the long awaited discussion document on the statutory review of Environment Canterbury this week.</p>
<p>“The Minister has been dragging the chain over this issue and his excuses ring hollow. Our right to have a democratically elected council was meant to be in place for the 2013 elections.</p>
<p>“The Government has stalled the timeline for a restoration of democracy once and now we have Nick Smith fudging the deadline.</p>
<p>“Last year Amy Adams and Paula Bennett announced that the review of Environment Canterbury would be completed by December 2014. That deadline was missed, despite documents showing Nick Smith received a cabinet paper to approve the release of a discussion document for public consultation in October.</p>
<p>“I have no faith that this Government is serious about Cantabrians’ right to vote. That’s why I’m introducing the bill.</p>
<p>“Nick Smith was the Minister who took away our vote in 2010. It’s now time he stopped being slippery and restored our democracy,” says Megan Woods.</p>
