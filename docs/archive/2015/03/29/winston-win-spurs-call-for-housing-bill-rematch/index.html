<p><strong>Winston win spurs call for housing bill rematch</strong></p>
<p>28 March 2015<br>Media Release: New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations</p>
<p>Students are calling for the Government to reintroduce or allow for Phil Twyford’s Healthy Homes Guarantee Bill to be reintroduced to Parliament off the back of Winston Peters’ historic victory in Northland.</p>
<p>Twyford’s bill would have require landlords to meet standards for insulation and heating, to be set by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority. Parliament was deadlocked when the bill came up last week 60-60, with National and ACT MPs opposing. Peters&#39; victory gives the bill majority support.</p>
<p>“There is now a parliamentary majority for Phil Twyford’s Healthy Homes Guarantee Bill; a bill that was voted down just last week in a tie. The Government should reintroduce it and let the people decide whether we have housing standards in New Zealand.” says national student president Rory McCourt.</p>
<p>“We just want houses that don’t make us sick. Winston’s win could make that happen.”</p>
<p>“National needs to let Parliament have a new say. This bill brings hope for students of winters without colds and flats without mould.” says McCourt.</p>
