<p><strong>Sunday, 8 March 2015, 10:46 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Will Iconic School Become Another Victim of Overheated Property Market?</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First Deputy Leader Tracey Martin is concerned moves are underway to undermine the achievements of Hato Petera College in Auckland, in order to cash in on the booming property market.</p>
<p>“The Catholic Diocese has offered Hato Petera College, which sits on prime real estate on Auckland’s North Shore, only a short-term extension to its lease, which is not providing the certainty this school needs to continue to move forward.</p>
<p>“Since its appointment four years ago the management team has met its brief set by the Ministry to lift achievement levels at the school, providing more opportunities for students and their future career paths.</p>
<p>“This is a college which provides valuable education for Maori students and its managers have worked hard to cater to their requirements.</p>
<p>“In fact, the latest ERO report suggests they’re succeeding.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First would hope that the ministry is having strong talks with the school to come up with ways to save it from becoming the victim of Auckland’s booming property market.</p>
<p>“We are urging the Minister of Education to put the same time, funding and energy that her ministry has spent on failing Northland charter school Te Pumanawa o te Wairua in Northland into saving an iconic Maori college that’s under threat from a cash-strapped landlord.”</p>
