<p><strong>Monday, 16 March 2015, 2:10 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Dyslexia Awareness Week</p>
<p>New Zealand First Deputy Leader and Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin is showing her support for Dyslexia Advocacy Week and for those students who require extra help at NCEA exam time.</p>
<p>“The Dyslexia Foundation of New Zealand (DFNZ) recently released figures showing the government is failing to deliver on its promise to focus on 250 mainly low decile schools to help students apply for extra help at exam time under special assessment conditions (SACs),” says Ms. Martin.</p>
<p>“SACs provide vital extra assistance for students during stressful exam times. Having someone available to help with reading or writing, allowing the use of a computer or providing additional time for students with conditions such as dyslexia can be the difference between a student passing or failing.</p>
<p>“The Foundation’s investigations show that there’s a considerable discrepancy between high and low decile schools. Highest decile schools are 17 times more likely to have a SAC application than a decile one school. DFNZ’s figures suggest at least 10,000 students who need SACs are missing out on them.</p>
<p>“This is an unacceptable state of affairs that needs to be addressed. New Zealand First would work with the sector to develop funding and resourcing models to best meet the needs of all children including digital resourcing for those learners challenged by dyslexia, dyspraxia, Asperger’s and autism.</p>
<p>“We owe it to these students to give them any and every assistance possible to help them achieve their potential and set them up for a future that places so much emphasis on academic achievement.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First urges the government to make a better effort to meet the learning needs of all students, including those challenged by dyslexia.</p>
<p>It’s time for “Making Good” and ‘Getting It Right’, says New Zealand First.</p>
