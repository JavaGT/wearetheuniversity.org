<p>Facing up to pest invasions: A new reality</p>
<p>With Queensland fruit fly breaching the borders yet again, despite investment in quarantine processes, questions need to be asked whether some pest incursions are inevitable and if more should be invested in preparedness rather than prevention.</p>
<p>That’s according to Professor Philip Hulme, an expert in plant biosecurity at the Bio-Protection Research Centre at Lincoln University.</p>
<p>“Biosecurity has traditionally had a strong border focus, yet we have seen many examples recently of major pests slipping through; such as PSA, potato/tomato psyllid, and the great white cabbage butterfly. We also know that there are many pests on the horizon that will be difficult to prevent from establishing here, including myrtle rust and the brown marmorated stink bug.</p>
<p>“It may be worth increasing the research spend on developing new techniques in biological control, building resilience in our crop varieties and cultivars, as well as increasing our effectiveness at eradication and control.</p>
<p>“These approaches all accept the possibility of a pest getting through, but look to undermine its impact once here. In short, ramping up the second line of defence before long-term pest management becomes the only option,” says Professor Hulme.</p>
<p>His comments come as Lincoln University prepares to host a panel discussion on pest management and biosecurity.</p>
<p>‘The Great Pest Invasion’ will be hosted by respected broadcaster Kim Hill, and explore whether current policies are sufficient to protect our native flora and fauna from biological threats, if these policies are appropriately managed, whether enough is being spent overall, and who should ultimately pay.</p>

<p>With the New Zealand economy relying so heavily on primary production and eco-tourism, biosecurity and pest management are matters which often prompt heated debate, as questions concerning 1080 or Gareth Morgan’s position on cats attest.</p>
<p>The discussion panel includes Lindsay Burton (Veterinarian – Risk Management Specialist, Fonterra Cooperative Group); Bill Dyck (Forest Biosecurity Manager, Forest Owners’ Association); Steve Gilbert (Director, Border Clearance Services, Ministry for Primary Industries); Barry O&#39;Neil (Chief Executive, Kiwifruit Vine Health Inc), Peter Silcock (Chief Executive Officer, Horticulture New Zealand); and Grant Smith (Programme Leader, Plant Biosecurity Cooperative Research Centre, Plant and Food Research).</p>
<p>‘The Great Pest Invasion’ is an open public event (minimum $5 koha suggested) to be held at Lincoln University on 26 March, with doors opening at 7pm for a 7.30pm start. Drinks and snack food will be provided. More details can be found at <a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/kimhilldebate">www.lincoln.ac.nz/kimhilldebate</a></p>
