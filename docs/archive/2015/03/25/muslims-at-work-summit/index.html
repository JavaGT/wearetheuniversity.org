<p>Equal Employment Commissioner to address ‘Muslims at Work’ Summit  </p>
<p>New Zealand’s Equal Employment Commissioner Dr Jackie Blue will address the Muslims at Work in New Zealand summit at AUT University on 1 April, describing how organisations seek to incorporate religion in their workplace.</p>
<p>Other speakers include Kevin Jenkins, managing director of MartinJenkins, Sheikh Rafat, the imam at AUT, Anne Lee and Fetiya Mohammed from the Umma Trust, New Zealand’s first ethnic police inspector Rakesh Naidoo, and Mohamud Mohamed Managing Director, Ethnic Perspective Advisory Services.</p>
<p>Topics covered by speakers will include the Muslim concept of work, what work success means to Muslims and the experience of Muslim women in the workplace.</p>
<p>Muslims at Work in New Zealand is convened by AUT Professor of Diversity Edwina Pio and targeted at HR professionals, managers in organisations, public sector leaders and other stakeholders in the community. It aims to improve understanding of, and provision for, the growing Muslim workforce in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The summit aims to dispel myths, shed light on the Islamic culture and create understanding of the diversity within our Muslim workforce,” says Professor Pio. “By sharing information and research we want to encourage delegates to promote understanding and positive change at an individual, organisational and national level. The more than 46,000 Muslims in New Zealand have a lot in common but they are also a diverse group, hailing from more than 50 countries, and crossing the spectrum of socio economic status, skills and education.”</p>

<p>“The Human Rights Commission welcomes this discussion on Muslims in the workplace. This forum provides the chance to discuss important challenges and opportunities. Education and awareness is critical to building a greater understanding for all New Zealanders,” says Race Relations Commissioner, Dame Susan Devoy.</p>
<p>“The Office of Ethnic Communities works to promote the economic benefits of our ethnically diverse population by identifying and removing barriers to participation and creating conditions conducive to increased participation. We believe people from diverse backgrounds, including Muslims, provide a positive contribution to New Zealand’s multicultural workforce and economy. We applaud AUT for fostering greater social cohesion by convening this summit,” says the Director of the Office of Ethnic Communities Berlinda Chin.</p>
<p>The Summit is supported by the Office of Ethnic Communities, the Human Rights Commission and the NZ Police.</p>
