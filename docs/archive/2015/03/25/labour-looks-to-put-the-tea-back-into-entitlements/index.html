<p>Labour looks to put the tea back into entitlements</p>
<p>Labour is moving to restore the rights of Kiwis to take tea and rest breaks, Leader Andrew Little says.</p>
<p>“Within months of the Government’s Employment Relations Amendment Bill becoming law we are already seeing some of our largest companies, including Cotton On and Postie Plus, trying to strip workers of their minimum smoko entitlements.</p>
<p>“A Member’s Bill Labour will introduce this week will reinstate a requirement that employers provide all staff with rest breaks.</p>
<p>“John Key’s excuse for this draconian law was that it would help small businesses and people such as air traffic controllers and hospitality workers.</p>
<p>“What we are seeing instead is full frontal claw-back by several major employers who have no need to remove entitlements.</p>
<p>“Tea and rest breaks aren’t just nice-to-haves.</p>
<p>“They are vital for the safety and wellbeing of Kiwi workers and were hard-won. They are as Kiwi as sausage rolls and lamingtons. Let’s keep it that way,” Andrew Little says.</p>
