<p><strong>New tourism partners aiming for sustainability</strong></p>
<p>A new tourism partnership will help contribute to the sustainability of the industry in New Zealand, say Lincoln University tourism expert Professor David Simmons and Tourism Industry Association New Zealand (TIA) Chief Executive Chris Roberts.</p>
<p>Lincoln University and TIA yesterday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which will allow the two organisations to share important industry information and networks.</p>
<p>The MOU between the industry peak body and the country’s longest-standing provider of tourism education programmes formalises a long-term relationship between the partners, Mr Roberts says.</p>
<p>“We deeply value the expertise, insight and passion Lincoln University’s tourism leaders bring to the industry. We are delighted to agree to this MOU, which demonstrates the alignment of effort needed if we are to achieve the industry’s goal of almost doubling total tourism revenue to $41 billion by 2025.”</p>
<p>TIA represents all sectors of New Zealand’s tourism industry and lobbies local and central government to shape policies. One of its key projects, Tourism 2025, is a framework for achieving industry growth.</p>
<p>Professor Simmons, who lectures in tourism at Lincoln University, says: “The MOU will give Lincoln increased exposure to industry leaders and politicians, allowing the University’s research to play a large role in informing future policies, and ensuring Lincoln’s courses are up-to-date with current trends and issues.</p>

<p>“We’ll also be able to form a partnership with TIA for research projects and programmes.”</p>
<p>TIA will seek the University’s contribution to projects such as the annual State of the Tourism Industry Reports, Tourism 2025 and other strategic tourism research.</p>
<p>It will also seek informed advice on key issues, both global and local, and connections with tourism students and academics.</p>
<p>“Lincoln established the country’s first tourism education programme in 1984 and since then, the growth in this area has been tremendous,” says Professor Simmons.</p>
<p>“Now we offer programmes from undergraduate to doctorate level, and they’re underpinned by cutting-edge global and local research, so the new partnership is very appropriate.”</p>
<p>Professor Simmons says Lincoln University and TIA have common goals for the sustainability of the sector in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Both organisations provide insight by educating people, carrying out research and organising strategic events.”</p>
