<p><em>Samoan father and daughter and University of Waikato students Dr Byron Malaela Sotiata Seiuli and Alisha Makerita-Nai Seiuli will graduate together in April.</em></p>
<p>It will be Byron Seiuli’s fourth graduation and Alisha Seiuli’s first, but in April they’ll graduate together at one of the University of Waikato’s graduation ceremonies.</p>
<p>On 16 April, Alisha will graduate at Claudelands Event Centre with a Bachelor of Communication Studies, and on 17 April, she will graduate with a Bachelor of Social Sciences majoring in Psychology at Te Kohinga Mārama Marae. Her dad Byron will graduate with her on that day with a PhD in Psychology.</p>
<p>Relatives and church friends from around New Zealand will gather in Hamilton to support and celebrate this family achievement.</p>
<p>After the 2009 tsunami that affected much of Samoa, Byron and Alisha spent time there working with churches, hospitals and villages. Byron says that from this experience came his doctoral research topic of examining cultural rituals involved in Samoan death practices and recovery.</p>
<p>“I began thinking about doing a PhD when Alisha was only 14, so it gives me great pride to now be graduating with her,” he says. “I’m really excited for Alisha. To complete two degrees in four years is phenomenal but she’s worked hard and has had scholarships throughout to help her financially. I’ve been able to be here both as a parent and mentor for her because I’ve been involved in study for a long time.”</p>

<p>Alisha began her studies at Waikato in 2011, just before her 16th birthday. Now she has a job at Lugton’s Real Estate where she works as an administration manager and executive assistant.</p>
<p>“Everything I learned when I was studying really flowed on into the job,” she says. “It’s a great graduate position to get me started and I hope to move into other roles as time goes on.”</p>
<p>Byron says he is the first person of Pacific descent to graduate with a PhD from Psychology at the University of Waikato where he also teaches, and he hopes his achievement will pave the way for other Pacific people.</p>
<p>He sees his role as being parent support not only for his daughter, but for other Pacific students coming through the University as well.</p>
<p>“This is my way of saying to other parents that our success is a Pacific success, and I’m here for others as a guide and a mentor. You’re never too young or too old to start on your academic journey.”</p>
