<p><strong>Don’t Cry for Me Aotearoa</strong></p>
<p>ACT’s new regular bulletin  </p>
<p><strong>It is Tight</strong></p>
<p>The weekend’s election shows how crucial ACT and Epsom are to stable centre right government.</p>
<p>Regions like Northland need resource development (see the excellent report <a href="http://www.act.org.nz/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=13220&qid=2529032">From Red Tape to Green Gold</a> by the New Zealand Initiative). The largest handbrake on this is the Resource Management Act. With Peter Dunne intransigent on RMA reform and ACT short one vote, RMA reform will now be decided by the Maori Party (who have two votes). We are optimistic because Maori have much to gain from using their natural resources, but in reality we may have just lost a decade to properly reform the Act.</p>
<p><strong>No Class</strong></p>
<p>National’s bridge bribe was a double clanger. Bad policy, bad politics. Successful election bribes, such as Helen Clark’s interest-free student loans, depend on the pork being covered in a crackling of pious virtue (e. g. “we’re doing it for our grandkids”). The bridge bribe was more of the canned spam variety.</p>
<p><strong>Time for a Reformation?</strong></p>
<p>National have two options when it comes to election bribes: get better or quit. We pray there are forces within National who have read the party’s (very good) founding constitution. They should apply internal pressure to end the neo-Muldoonism that made the bridge bribe reflexive.</p>

<p><strong>Northlanders Saw it First</strong></p>
<p>Northlanders watched government hand out billions to Christchurch and Auckland, and tens of millions thrown like confetti on subsidies for sailors to play with billionaires and assistance for casinos to expand. Ten bridges? They must have thought, really?</p>
<p><strong>Record Breaker</strong></p>
<p>Winston Peters is now set to be run out of three electorates in one career. David Seymour puts in hour after hour covering New Zealand’s (geographically) smallest electorate. It will be interesting to see just how dedicated the Force for the North will be in attending school fairs, electorate clinics, and all the other activities that a diligent electorate MP performs. Get your invites in early folks.</p>
<p><strong>Plus ça Change</strong></p>
<p>Mr Peters likes to blame the Reserve Bank Act for whatever seems to be the problem of the day. It’s a clever and opportunistic political pitch: hopelessly wrong, but monetary policy is complex enough that he gets away with it. Ridiculous assertions about monetary policy also used to work for Social Credit back in the ‘60s. Some things never change.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunity for ACT</strong></p>
<p>Centre right voters have an alternative party. ACT opposes all corporate welfare, middle class welfare, unsustainable superannuation, bracket creep, wanton government interventionism, and stifling land-use regulation. Like-minded voters are welcome home over the coming two years.</p>
<p><strong>A Broken Selection Model</strong></p>
<p>Free Press pointed out National’s candidate wasn’t exactly a young JFK. We are reminded of when Clem Simich was picked ahead of David Kirk. It is only through sheer determination that John Key avoided rejection by the Helensville electorate committee. How many of Hekia Parata, Steven Joyce, and Chris Finlayson would be in Parliament if they relied on a National electorate committee for selection?</p>
<p><strong>That will be $300, Thanks</strong></p>
<p>When candidates are nominated the Electoral Commission asks for $300 to prove they’re serious. If the candidate gets five per cent of the vote, this deposit is returned to the candidate. Willow-Jean Prime is likely the first Labour Candidate since 1916 to lose her deposit.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Damage</strong></p>
<p>Andrew Little’s job is to build Labour, or so we thought. They didn’t just fail in Northland, they surrendered at the starting line. Mr Little has relinquished his claim to be the prime opposition leader. By extension, he cannot claim he would be a powerful Prime Minister. Centre and Right voters have received a clear message: the alternative to a National-ACT government is a Winston-Labour-Green one, almost in that order.</p>
<p><strong>Labour Hypocrisy in Epsom</strong></p>
<p>Last year Labour’s Epsom candidate tiresomely told voters he had come to Epsom to save democracy from strategic voting. We won’t have to listen to that next election. Then there’s the Greens. MP David Clendon, who lives in Kerikeri, could have handily flown a Green flag in Northland. Alas, the Greens didn&#39;t stand a candidate.</p>
<p><strong>Proud of our Good Keen Man</strong></p>
<p>Robin Grieve is the embodiment of ACT’s work ethic. Our good keen man in Northland has been everywhere, through the press, at public meetings, in the streets and on the doorstep. His team erected billboards from Mangonui to Wellsford. Unlike Labour and the Greens we are used to strategic voting so his votes do not reflect his efforts, but he did ACT proud.</p>
<p><strong>Chip In</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to generous donors the campaign almost broke even. If you’d like to tribute the spirit Robin brought to the election you can do so here: <a href="http://www.act.org.nz/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=13221&qid=2529032">http://www.act.org.nz/donate</a></p>
<p><strong>Future Transport</strong></p>
<p>On Thursday David Seymour attended the launch of a local ride-sharing app, <a href="http://www.act.org.nz/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=13222&qid=2529032">Chariot</a>. Smartphone technology is bringing about a transport revolution where ride-sharing, hailing, and paying get easier and easier. This technology tends to pop up from nowhere and interfere with politicians’ grand ideas of how people should get around. ACT will keep government modest about its grand plans. Let’s not fear unexpected innovation.</p>
