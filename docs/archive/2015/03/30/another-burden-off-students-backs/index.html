<p>Another burden off students’ backs</p>
<p><strong>Press release: ACT New Zealand<br>March 30, 2015. 5:10pm</strong></p>
<p>Four years after ACT’s private members bill to free students from compulsory unionism became law, students may be relieved of another burden, according to David Cunliffe.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.act.org.nz/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=13226&qid=2533352">In a statement today</a>, Mr Cunliffe speculated that NZUSA may collapse, a possibility welcomed by ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“The decline of student unionism proves what we’ve always suspected: students never wanted to join unions and now it seems the unions themselves don’t want to join NZUSA,” said Mr Seymour.</p>
<p>“Thanks to ACT’s Voluntary Student Membership (VSM) bill, tertiary students are no longer forced to fund breeding grounds for aspiring socialist politicians.</p>
<p>“Even students think university politics is tedious. Most want to get on with gaining their qualifications.</p>
<p>“The union has typically lobbied as though students never graduate. They consistently argue for subsidies and price controls that will lower the quality of education while whacking taxpaying graduates. This is likely because many student politicians themselves never graduate.</p>
<p>“If Labour really wants support on campus, they could campaign on making unions repay the countless millions of dollars in union fees compulsorily taken from students before ACT passed VSM.”</p>
