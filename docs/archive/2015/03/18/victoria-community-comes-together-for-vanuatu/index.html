<p>Victoria community comes together for Vanuatu</p>
<p>Staff and students from Victoria University of Wellington have come together to provide support to Vanuatu following the damage caused by Cyclone Pam.</p>
<p>Victoria University will support a number of fundraising initiatives together with the Victoria Pasifika Students’ Council, Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA), Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Pasifika) Associate Professor Hon Luamanuvao Winnie Laban and Vanuatu-born lecturer Dr Pala Molisa.</p>
<p>Initiatives include a benefit concert featuring &#39;Young Life&#39;, one of Vanuatu&#39;s most acclaimed reggae bands and a bucket collection this Friday 20 March on all Victoria’s campuses. A dedicated bank account has been established for all fundraising proceeds and donations.</p>
<p>“It’s incredibly sad to see the devastation to people’s homes, the roads and infrastructure in Vanuatu. With a strong Pacific presence at Victoria, this is the least we can do,” says Luamanuvao Laban. “We envisage that the funds raised will be targeted at a medium-term initiative, such as a specific education initiative in Vanuatu.”</p>
<p>Karl Moresi, President of the Pasifika Students’ Council, is calling for student support. “We’ll be having an ‘appeal day’ at the University where students will be able to donate and show their support for Vanuatu.”</p>
<p>VUWSA President Rick Zwaan is pleased the students’ association is involved and able to show solidarity as Vanuatu rebuilds from the devastating cyclone. “This joint initiative is a way to show support in a tangible way by raising funds and working with our local Vanuatu community to ensure they are well used,” he says.</p>

<p>Dr Pala Molisa, who is from Vanuatu and is a lecturer at Victoria, says the damage that the cyclone has inflicted on Vanuatu is unprecedented in the country’s history, with almost the entire population of Vanuatu affected, 90 per cent of buildings damaged or destroyed and 10,000 displaced in Port Vila alone.</p>
<p>“I am very proud to be part of the team generating projects that support the country’s rebuilding efforts,&quot; says Dr Molisa.</p>
