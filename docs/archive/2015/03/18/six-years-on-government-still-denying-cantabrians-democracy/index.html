<p><strong>Six years on and the Government is still denying Cantabrians regional democracy</strong></p>
<p>National is attempting to control local government in Canterbury, and is denying its people the right to make their own decisions, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>The Government has proposed to have no regional council elections for Environment Canterbury Regional Council (ECan) until 2016 and then to have Ministers appoint six members of the 13-person regional council after the 2016 elections. ECan has been run by seven Government-appointed commissioners since 2010.</p>
<p>&quot;National doesn&#39;t seem to trust the people of Canterbury to elect councillors to act in the best interests of the region. This is a ‘we know better than you’ proposal,” Green Party Christchurch spokesperson Eugenie Sage said.</p>
<p>&quot;What National is proposing is a significant wind back of local democracy. The Government wants to impose yes-men and women to act in the interests of Wellington Ministers rather than have locals who are responsible to the people of Canterbury.</p>
<p>&quot;It’s a Wellington-controlled model, plain and simple. We need a 100% Canterbury-controlled model, the way other regions operate, not one where Cantabrians are second class citizens as far as regional democracy is concerned.</p>
<p>“National has broken its 2010 promise to restore regional democracy by 2013. It stole regional democracy in Canterbury to facilitate more irrigation development, more water pollution and a weaker planning regime to benefit irrigators and water users. That’s why it wants to appoint so many council members rather than trust voters to elect councillors to represent them.</p>
<p>“The Green Party would restore democracy to Canterbury, and put decision-making back into the hands of the people who live there and away from the yes-men and women in Wellington,” said Ms Sage.</p>
