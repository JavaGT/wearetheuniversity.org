<p>Joyce heading in wrong direction on two-speed economy  </p>
<p>Steven Joyce’s denials that New Zealand is a two-speed economy shows he is the one driving on the wrong side of the road, Labour’s Economic Development spokesperson David Clark says.</p>
<p>“Moody’s rating agency has said what New Zealanders have known for some time. New Zealand has a two-speed economy, where our critical export market is tanking while our domestic market, fuelled by Auckland housing prices and the Canterbury rebuild, is propping up the economy.</p>
<p>“National set a target for exports to be 40 per cent of GDP but instead of increasing exports they have dropped to below 30 per cent.</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s regions are struggling under the two-speed economy, especially Northland which needs the export sector to be in strong health.</p>
<p>“With 150 jobs lost at HarvestPro in Northland it’s clear the two-speed economy is stuttering into a two-stroke economy in The North.</p>
<p>“It is incredibly arrogant that Steven Joyce not only ignores the facts, he ignores the people of Northland and the ratings agencies.</p>
<p>“Everyone apart from Steven Joyce knows we have a two-speed economy that’s hurting New Zealand. He is driving in the wrong direction. Kiwis should take the keys off him,” David Clark said.</p>
