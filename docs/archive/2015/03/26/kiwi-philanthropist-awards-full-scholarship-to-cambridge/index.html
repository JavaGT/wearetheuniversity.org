<p><strong>Kiwi philanthropist awards full scholarship to 18 year-old to Cambridge</strong></p>
<p>A scholarship funded by businessman Sir Douglas Myers for a future New Zealand leader to study at Cambridge University has been awarded to exceptional 18 year-old Ethan Sorrell from Waterview, Auckland.</p>
<p>Last year, while studying at Avondale College, Ethan came first in the world in the Cambridge International exams for both Psychology and Biology, was top in New Zealand for A level Chemistry and Physics, and achieved the best average score among New Zealand students across any three A-level subjects. He also came top in Scholarship Physics.</p>
<p>The Sir Douglas Myers Scholarship provides an opportunity for students to complete undergraduate study at Gonville and Caius College, at the University of Cambridge (UK) - one of the most prestigious universities in the world. The Scholarship, worth approximately NZ$100,000 over three years will provide Ethan with his tuition fees and a living allowance.</p>
<p>Ethan who is currently at the University of Auckland, will take up the scholarship to study bioengineering in October this year.</p>
<p>Ethan says, “I want to solve real world problems that can help improve the quality of people’s lives worldwide. My dream is to take part in research to do with the brain and the use of the nervous system, to develop thought-controlled prostheses. I aim to enable those who have lost limbs to lead lives parallel to those who haven’t.”</p>

<p>While at Avondale College, Ethan was awarded a silver medal at the International Biology Olympiad for secondary school students held in Bali last year. As well as achieving high grades, he was also the Deputy Head Boy, represented the school in the 1st XI football team, and was co-organiser of the school ball. In addition he represented Auckland in the national track and field championships, competing in the high jump and long jump.</p>
<p>In announcing the scholarship, Mr John Taylor, Chair of the selection panel said, “It is Sir Douglas Myers’ hope that the scholars will be great ambassadors for New Zealand wherever they are in the world, whether or not they return home in the near future&quot;.</p>
<p>Universities New Zealand, formerly the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’ Committee, administers this scholarship, in addition to 40 other undergraduate and postgraduate scholarships, each year.</p>
