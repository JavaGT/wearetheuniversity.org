<p>Media Release</p>
<p>14 July 2015<br>- for immediate release</p>
<p>Lincoln University begins international search for new Vice-Chancellor  </p>
<p>Lincoln University – New Zealand’s specialist land-based university – has begun the process of appointing a new Vice-Chancellor.</p>
<p>The process will involve an extensive search both within New Zealand and internationally, and is expected to take between five to seven months.</p>
<p>Staff, alumni, industry groups and community groups, including Ngāi Tahu and Te Taumutu Rūnanga, will have the opportunity to be involved in the process of identifying the skills now required to lead the 137 year old institution to ensure Lincoln continues to meet the needs of all stakeholders and to best serve the land-based sectors into the future.</p>
<p>While the process of appointing a new Vice-Chancellor takes place, the University has appointed Dr John Hay as Interim Vice-Chancellor. Dr Hay, an alumnus of Lincoln University, is currently Chair of the NZ Science Board and Chair of the Bio-Protection Research Centre. Dr Hay’s appointment will enable the senior managers and staff of the University to continue to focus on the implementation of the University’s priority strategies and projects.</p>
<p>Key areas of focus for the University are continued growth in student numbers, advancing the Lincoln Hub, supporting the staff of the University to deliver high quality research, and enabling the learning and teaching experience for which Lincoln is well known.</p>
