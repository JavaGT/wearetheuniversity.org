<p><strong>Victoria University ignores feedback, attacks democracy</strong></p>
<p>The national students’ union has slammed Victoria University’s plans for its new council as a completely unacceptable attack on campus democracy.</p>
<p>On Monday the university council released a controversial proposal replacing six elected staff and student representatives with four appointees hand-picked by a special committee.</p>
<p>NZUSA President Rory McCourt says that while the elements of Victoria’s proposal to boost diversity on its council are praiseworthy, removing independent, democratic representation is out of step with Victoria’s own feedback on the changes and the approach being taken by other universities -almost all of whom have chosen to seat the elected students’ association president and allow staff to elect their own representatives.</p>
<p>The proposal includes the ‘expectation’ that two current students are appointed; while there is no guarantee that current staff members will have any seats on the new council. Instead, two academic ‘experts’ would be appointed by the all-powerful &#39;Appointments Panel&#39;. These experts could be members of management or even former employees of the university. Concerningly, general staff members such as librarians, researchers and counselors will have their representatives removed altogether.</p>
<p>“What is proposed is a politically incestuous structure. There’s nothing to stop this Appointments Panel, itself mostly appointed by Council, from choosing yes-people to join the Council’s ranks. There are no democratic checks, and no room for genuine, independent representation. Who will ask the hard questions?”</p>

<p>“What people will be asking is ‘Why is this council so determined to insulate itself from popular opinion and independent thought?&#39;”</p>
<p>In the proposal document the university admitted that it was ignoring the will of the community by setting up the new council in the way it intends, writing that “A clear preference was expressed by academic staff, students and alumni that those members of Council be chosen by election.”</p>
<p>“Universities were given an opportunity by the legislation to listen to their communities and choose democracy over old-boys clubs. So far, Victoria has failed that test.”</p>
<p>“If the Council adopts this proposal against all reason and the wishes of their own university community, we will be calling for a complete rewrite of the legislation. Implementing a structure such as this would show that universities cannot be trusted to safeguard campus democracy. That would be a sad outcome for all.”</p>
<p>Mr McCourt says given the proposal is widely unacceptable to students and staff, the Council would be best to head back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>“If Victoria is sincere about this consultation, it will throw these plans in the bin and work with students and staff to build a campus democracy befitting a democratic capital city.”</p>
<p>“Scrapping democracy just doesn&#39;t fit with Victoria’s drive to be a world-class capital city university, unless of course they’re modelling themselves on Pyongyang.” McCourt concludes.</p>
