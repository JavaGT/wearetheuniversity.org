<p><strong>Wednesday, 8 July 2015, 3:17 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Another four year wait for democracy in Canterbury</p>
<p>Today’s announcement that there will not be a democratic vote for Ecan until 2019 means four more years of waiting for Cantabrians to get their vote back, says Labour’s Environment spokesperson Megan Woods.</p>
<p>“When John Key stripped Cantabrians of their votes in 2010, it was with the expectation it would be a temporary arrangement. Instead today the Government has announced a ‘mixed governance’ model until 2019.</p>
<p>“The Government appointing nearly half the Ecan councillors in no way, shape or form counts as a return to democracy. Calling it a transition to democracy is misleading, this is just denying Cantabrians their rights for four more years.</p>
<p>“Cantabrians have already waited 1927 days to get their vote back and it will be about another 1545 days under the plan announced today. That’s wrong.</p>
<p>“Documents released to Labour under the OIA show officials warned the Government that continuing with an undemocratic Ecan would set a dangerous precedent for future changes. Today’s announcement shows the Government is barrelling ahead with no concern for democracy.</p>
<p>“This raises the spectre of New Zealanders in other parts of the country being stripped of their votes as well.</p>
<p>“It is an insult to Cantabrians. Once again the Government has decided that people in Canterbury cannot be trusted to make their own decisions about their future.</p>
<p>“The Government should give people in Canterbury their vote back, and reinstate a fully democratically elected Ecan for next year’s local government elections. They won’t do that, so I’ve put a Member’s Bill in the ballot that will,” says Megan Woods.</p>
