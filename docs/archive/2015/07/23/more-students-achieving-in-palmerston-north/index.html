<p>Public Achievement Information shows more students achieving in Palmerston North</p>
<p>List MP Jono Naylor says parents will be happy to know there is steady improvement in Palmerston North with more kids attending Early Childhood Education, achieving National Standards and passing NCEA Level 2.</p>
<p>Palmerston North has seen increasing NCEA results at Levels 1, 2 and 3. The goal of 85 per cent of 18 year olds leaving school with NCEA Level by 2017 is close to being achieved with a 4.7 per cent increase over the last year.</p>
<p>&quot;This is fantastic news. I want to congratulate all our hard-working students, and thank their parents, teachers, and principals who supported their education and their achievements,” Naylor said.</p>
<p>Early Childhood Education participation rates are at 98.3 per cent, above the 2017 target of 98 per cent.</p>
<p>“We know the earlier our children get started in education, the better off they will be. The early childhood years are vital to a child’s development and to their future ability to learn so it’s great to see that the vast majority of Kiwi kids are getting the best possible start in life,” Naylor said.</p>
<p>“The proportion of 18-year-olds with NCEA Level 2 has risen in each of New Zealand’s 16 local body regions.</p>
<p>“The breakdown shows that between 2011 and 2014 the percentage of 18-year-olds with NCEA Level 2 rose by between 3.8 per cent and 18.4 per cent on a regional basis. Palmerston North rose by 4.7 per cent.</p>
<p>“The Government is committed to ensuring all young New Zealanders can achieve educational success and these results show that what we’re doing is working.</p>
