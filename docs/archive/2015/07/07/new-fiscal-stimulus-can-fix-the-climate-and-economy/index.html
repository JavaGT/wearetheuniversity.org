<p>New fiscal stimulus can fix the climate and economy</p>
<p>Stimulatory spending to help boost the economy can also help address climate change, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>ANZ Chief Economist Cameron Bagrie yesterday called for central and local Governments to move to a more stimulatory fiscal stance.</p>
<p>“If the Government is smart, any new stimulatory spending to boost the economy can address climate change at the same time,” Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said.</p>
<p>“For smart, new capital expenditure, the Government can move forward spending on Auckland’s City Rail Link – the number one transport priority for Auckland and a project that will employ hundreds and help reduce Auckland’s climate emissions from transport.</p>
<p>“The Government can also help schools reduce their power bills by investing $20 million into solar power systems in schools, allowing them to benefit from cheaper, cleaner power, leaving them with more money to invest directly into teaching and learning.</p>
<p>“Finally, the Government can create and invest capital in the Green Investment Bank. Such a bank would be a government-owned, for-profit bank that would partner with the private sector to speed the funding of new climate-protecting projects, ranging from renewable energy and biofuel production to new clean technologies.</p>
<p>“To date, National has proposed more spending on low-value roads, which will increase our emissions and slow our transition to a low-carbon economy. This is neither a smart way to stimulate the economy or address climate change.</p>

<p>“We don’t think John Key should rule out new operational spending, especially if it is high quality spending.</p>
<p>“During the last recession, National helped stimulate the economy by investing in the Green Party’s home insulation scheme, employing thousands and making 235,000 more New Zealand homes warm and dry.</p>
<p>“That high-quality spend helped move the economy out of recession while lowering the amounts of energy needed to heat our homes. For every dollar invested in insulation, there are $5 of health improvements, mostly to the public health system.</p>
<p>“The job is not done, however; there are still hundreds of thousands more homes to go,” said Mrs Turei.</p>
