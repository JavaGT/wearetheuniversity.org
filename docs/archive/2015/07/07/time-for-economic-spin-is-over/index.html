<p>Time for economic spin is over  </p>
<p>Business confidence in the latest NZIER Quarterly Survey of Business Opinion falling to its lowest level in three years is yet another warning of a staggering economy that cannot be ignored, says Labour&#39;s leader Andrew Little.</p>
<p>“This comes on the back of dairy prices falling by a third since March, plummeting wage and employment expectations and a big drop in exports.</p>
<p>“John Key and National have been complacent and squandered the opportunities they had to diversify the economy through a period of good growth.</p>
<p>“It is disturbing that the survey has also revealed that business confidence is falling across the country with dairy producing regions like Canterbury ,Waikato and Southland the worst hit.</p>
<p>“Despite the Auckland housing bubble business confidence has also fallen, to its lowest in three years.</p>
<p>“Now is not the time for back sliding and spin, the Government has to take responsibility and support businesses and workers through these headwinds.</p>
<p>“It is worrying that the Government has become so distracted with political obsessions like the state house sell-off and a frivolous flag referendum that they have let the economy slide,” says Andrew Little.  </p>
