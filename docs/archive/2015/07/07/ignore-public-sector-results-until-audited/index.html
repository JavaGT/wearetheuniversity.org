<p>Ignore Public Sector Results until Audited</p>
<p>New Zealanders should ignore all “results” from the public sector, including education, police and social services, until they are independently scrutinised, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“Questions are being asked about NCEA results and manipulation of arrest statistics,” says Spokersperson for Social Development Darroch Ball. “The Salvation Army also questions the accuracy of social services statistics.</p>
<p>“The situation is now absurd with the government setting its own public service targets while it refuses to have the ‘achievements’ independently audited.</p>
<p>“We suggest that the government’s targets are simply putting pressure on everyone to achieve, and they are forced to do this in any way they can.</p>
<p>“Some schools have introduced ‘weaker’ subjects just so more students can get through.</p>
<p>“The government set their own targets in 2012, they have marked the results themselves, and are touting them as proof of improvement – with no independent oversight.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders deserve to have confidence in the results the government agencies produce,” says Mr Ball.</p>
<p>“The government should eliminate all doubt over the results and get them independently reviewed by the Office of the Auditor General.”</p>
