<p>Hekia just won’t face the facts  </p>
<p>Hekia Parata’s decision to keep troubled Whangaruru Charter school open despite being presented with a catalogue of failure defies belief, goes against official advice and breaks a Government promise to close these schools if they were failing, says Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins.</p>
<p>“Both Hekia Parata and the Prime Minister John Key have said that if charter schools fail they will not remain open. A damning audit of the Whangaruru school has found there were grounds for closure but the Minister has ignored this and overruled her own officials advice.</p>
<p>“What is it going to take for this Government to admit that this disastrous and wasteful educational experiment is not working. This is a failing cornerstone of National’s education policy which is seeing five times the amount of taxpayers’ funds spent per pupil at Charter schools as at Public schools.</p>
<p>“There is absolutely no doubt that state schools could do some pretty amazing things for disadvantaged children if they were given this level of funding.</p>
<p>“It is shameful to continue to put the students at Whangaruru at risk and Hekia Parata must be held accountable.</p>
<p>“The problems at Whangaruru are just the tip of the iceberg. This week it was revealed that another charter school in Auckland is facing a parent revolt.</p>
<p>“Today’s news was released cynically on a Friday afternoon in the midst of another failing privatisation experiment over Serco running New Zealand’s prisons,” says Chris Hipkins .</p>
