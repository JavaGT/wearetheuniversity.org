<p><strong>Friday, 24 July 2015, 1:39 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tracey Martin MP</strong></p>
<p>Spokesperson for Education<br>24 JULY 2015  </p>
<p><strong>Charter School Announcement No Surprise</strong></p>
<p>Education Minister Hekia Parata has announced that the failing Whangaruru charter school will remain open despite receiving advice to the contrary – not only will it remain open but surprise, surprise this government will funnel over $100,000 more of taxpayers’ money into it.</p>
<p>&quot;For the Minister to say that she is ignoring all advice because she has concerns for the students is absolute nonsense,&quot; says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Minister had given two hoots about these kids she would have followed the original advice from Ministry officials to never open the school to start with. This is another example of a National government experiment that cannot be allowed to fail no matter the cost to taxpaying New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“It is clear the government is doing all it can to protect the flagship policy of the failing ACT Party while putting the future of these young people attending the school at risk.</p>
<p>“This is Novopay all over again and highlights the government’s inability to manage contracts. They simply set a contract, put in KPIs, then ignore them and get more money. This Minister and this policy have no credibility in education.</p>
<p>“Our kids and our teaching professionals deserve better,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
