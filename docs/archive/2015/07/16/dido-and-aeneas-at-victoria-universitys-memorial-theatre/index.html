<p>Virgil&#39;s tale is thousands of years old but really nothing’s changed; it’s a hard row finding the perfect partner.</p>
<p>Aeneas is perfect for Dido in just about every way, except he has some work commitments in the underworld.</p>
<p>Is Aeneas prepared to give up career ambition for the sake of love? And if he does, will Dido have him back?</p>
<p>Wellingtonians can see this absorbing tragedy when Te Kōkī New Zealand School of Music stages Henry Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas at Victoria University’s Memorial Theatre.</p>
<p>In its biannual opera production, the school is coupling Dido and Aeneas, with French composer Maurice Ravel’s delightful L’Enfant et les Sortilèges.</p>
<p>Soprano Alicia Cadwgan is the heartbroken female lead in Dido and Aeneas, unable to accept her lover’s decision to go off to war. Singing beside her is Rotorua-born tenor Declan Cudd as the Trojan hero Aeneas.</p>
<p>Cudd, 21, rose through the ranks to lead roles in musicals at high school and sings professionally with the NZ Opera Chorus but says Aeneas is his most heroic character so far.</p>
<p>“People think Aeneas is an anti-hero, but he has a great sense of duty that willed him to leave Dido,” Cudd says.</p>

<p>Cudd’s teachers Richard Greager and Lisa Harper-Brown know what it takes because they’re professionally active in the opera world.</p>
<p>“They’re helping to extend my range lower and want me to make more noise down there.”</p>
<p>Fulbright scholar Frances Moore is directing. She spent six months at New York University with exclusive access to tech rehearsals at the famous Metropolitan Opera.</p>
<p>“She provides us all with the environment to develop our own ideas and really teaches us along the way,” Cudd says.</p>
