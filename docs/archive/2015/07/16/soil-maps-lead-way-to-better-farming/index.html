<p><strong>Soil maps lead way to better farming</strong></p>
<p>Producing detailed soil maps of New Zealand farms could help improve food production across the country, as well as reduce nitrate leaching, a Lincoln University report suggests.</p>
<p>A group of Lincoln students recently spent four days conducting a soil survey of Glengael Farm, near Cheviot, to see if soil-mapping was a worthwhile strategy for increasing farming productivity and minimising the environmental damage caused by agricultural practices.</p>
<p>The soil survey, a component of the students’ final year Soil Resources paper, was supervised by Lincoln University Soil and Physical Sciences Associate Professor Peter Almond, and Dr Sam Carrick.</p>
<p>The student exercise was part of a larger research effort, known as the Forages for Reduced Nitrate Leaching Programme (FRNL), led by DairyNZ in partnership with several Crown Research Institutes.</p>
<p>The programme encompasses a range of projects aimed at reducing nitrate leaching losses from pasture and forage crops.</p>
<p>Glengael Farm is one of nine monitor farms in the FRNL programme.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Almond says soil-mapping could allow farmers to carry out practices that are specific to their property and relevant to local soil characteristics.</p>
<p>“This may increase plant biomass production and animal health and provide long-term financial and environmental sustainability.”</p>
<p>He says farmers could be encouraged to follow Glengael Farm’s example of obtaining a detailed soil map.</p>

<p>“The more this happens nationwide, the more reliable and accurate the information base will be, which will further encourage efficient farming practices and pro-environmental actions in the wider agricultural community.”</p>
<p>Glengael Farm is a 484.4ha property that produces sheep and beef, running 2000 breeding ewes and carrying 1000 hoggets every year, as well as 60 beef cattle and 160 dairy grazers.</p>
<p>During their survey of the farm, the Lincoln University students carried out a detailed spatial analysis of the soils at the property in order to produce a comprehensive map.</p>
<p>For each soil type, pits were dug to 1.5m deep and the key soil features were identified under New Zealand Soil Classification.</p>
<p>The students then worked with Landcare Research’s S-map national soil survey team to produce fact sheets for each soil and assess them in terms of nitrate-leaching vulnerability, drainage ability and water-holding capacity.</p>
<p>“The farm was then subdivided into a patchwork according to combinations of soil and landscape characteristics,” says Associate Professor Almond.</p>
<p>“This allows the farmer to use separate management strategies for each landform, according to the nature of the soil.”</p>
<p>After carrying out their survey, students came up with a number of recommendations for the Glengael farmer and the FRNL monitor farm research team.</p>
<p>“They suggested that creating management zones which aligned with the soil-landscape units would be beneficial to encourage sustainable, efficient irrigation and nutrient application,” says Associate Professor Almond.</p>
<p>“They also said plants should be chosen for their particular traits and applied to the different soils accordingly to improve production and reduce environmental impact.”</p>
<p>Other recommendations included using precision nutrient management, or farming software, to increase crop productivity.</p>
<p>“This could be a particularly useful technology on Glengael Farm, because of the variable and strongly contrasting soil pattern,” says Associate Professor Almond.</p>
<p>“Different soils are able to produce highly productive crops, according to their particular properties, which precision technology can help to pinpoint.”</p>
<p>The students also identified variable irrigation as beneficial for farmers wanting to increase crop production while minimising costs.</p>
<p>“This is a management tool that applies varying amounts of water to match specific zones,” says Associate Professor Almond.</p>
<p><em>Forages for Reduced Nitrate Leaching is a DairyNZ-led programme in partnership with AgResearch, Foundation for Arable Research, Landcare Research, Lincoln University and Plant &amp; Food Research.
