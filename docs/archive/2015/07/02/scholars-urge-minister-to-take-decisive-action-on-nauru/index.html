<p><strong>Thursday, 2 July 2015, 12:37 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Legal scholars urge minister to take decisive action on Nauru</p>
<p>Twenty nine New Zealand legal scholars have written an open letter to the foreign minister Hon Murray McCully (attached), calling on him to take more decisive action over the deteriorating constitutional situation in Nauru.</p>
<p>The scholars include former Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Palmer, and former Attorney-General and Speaker Margaret Wilson.</p>
<p>“Since the 2013 election in Nauru, there has been a series of disturbing developments on the islands that indicate a severe deterioration in the state of its parliamentary democracy and in the rule of law,” say the scholars.</p>
<p>Last year, the government forced out of office the island’s (then) only judge, and suspended most of the opposition from Parliament indefinitely. The government has also prohibited local media from speaking to the opposition, and has closed down access to Facebook for Nauruan citizens, amongst other things.</p>
<p>“The dismantling of an effective judicature”, says the letter, “together with the silencing of the media, opposition and even ordinary citizens on Facebook means that the government of Nauru is now virtually immune from scrutiny of its actions.”</p>
<p>Recently, following a protest outside Parliament, three opposition MPs were arrested and charged with offences. Two are being held without bail. The five suspended MPs have had their passports cancelled.</p>
<p>The letter expresses particular concern for the Wellington-based family of suspended Nauruan opposition MP Roland Kun. Last year, the Nauruan government revoked the visa of Mr Kun’s wife (an Australian citizen) so that she cannot live on Nauru. The family resettled in Wellington. By cancelling Mr Kun’s passport while he was visiting Nauru, the Nauruan government has now forced the couple’s separation. Mr Kun is the primary caregiver of the couple’s three children and the youngest is only 18 months old.</p>

<p>The letter urges the Minister to make urgent representations to the Nauruan government about the deteriorating rule of law situation. If Nauru does not move swiftly to take remedial action, the letter urges the Minister to withdraw New Zealand funding from Nauru’s Department of Justice and Border Control, of which New Zealand is the principal funder.</p>
<p>“It is not tenable for New Zealand to continue in its role of principal funder of Nauru’s justice sector while democracy and the rule of law are in such disarray and while so many basic human rights are being denied,” the letter says.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New Zealand Law Society also issued a press release, saying that it was time to speak out about the deteriorating situation in Nauru.</p>
