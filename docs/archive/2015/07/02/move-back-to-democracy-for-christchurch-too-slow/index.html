<p><strong>Move back to democracy for Christchurch too slow</strong></p>
<p>The Government is still intent on trying to control Christchurch’s future from the Beehive, Green Party Christchurch spokesperson Eugenie Sage said today.</p>
<p>The Green Party today responded to the announcement of new power structures for Canterbury’s recovery from the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes. A new entity named Regenerate Christchurch will help take over the management of the city&#39;s rebuild from the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA). This will involve new legislation called the Greater Christchurch Regeneration Bill, proposed to run for another five years from April 2016.</p>
<p>“Inventing a new entity called Regenerate Christchurch and giving it some of CERA’s powers continues to suppress the democratic decision making role of the Christchurch City Council,” said Ms Sage.</p>
<p>“It also risks duplicating and cutting across the work of the City Council’s proposed new urban development authority.</p>
<p>“Continuing key powers in the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) legislation beyond April 2016 through this new agency will allow Government to continue to dominate decision making.</p>
<p>“The Christchurch City Council has signed off its long term plan and budget for the next 10 years. It needs to be given back its powers to co-ordinate and plan the city’s future.</p>
<p>“The post ‘quake emergency is long gone yet the Government continues to seek to justify its meddling so it can impose super-sized and unaffordable anchor projects like the stadium and the convention centre on the city.</p>
<p>“It is time for the National Government to trust the people of Christchurch to make decisions for themselves about the future rebuild of their city,” Ms Sage said.</p>
