<p>Students staying engaged at Hutt Valley schools  </p>
<p>National List MP based in the Hutt Valley Chris Bishop says there has been a significant drop in the number of school students being suspended, stood-down, excluded, and expelled from schools in the Hutt Valley.</p>
<p>“Under the National-led government, Hutt kids are staying in school longer and getting better results,” Mr Bishop says.</p>
<p>“In the Hutt South electorate, stand-downs have dropped 32 per cent since 2008, and suspensions have fallen 81 per cent.</p>
<p>“In the Rimutaka electorate, stand-downs have dropped 28.5 per cent since 2008, and suspensions have fallen 34 per cent.</p>
<p>“The national average decline for stand-downs is 28 per cent, while for suspensions the average decline is 37 per cent. The Hutt is therefore doing well compared to the rest of New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Exclusions and expulsions at Hutt schools are also down significantly.</p>
<p>“National is focusing on improving performance in the schooling system so every child has the opportunity to succeed, as we know high-quality education provides the opportunity for any child from any background to get ahead and make the most of their life”, says Mr Bishop.</p>
