<p>The University of Waikato’s Management School and Te Piringa - Faculty of Law have worked together to develop the new qualification, which is specially designed for those who wish to develop the necessary skillset for governance roles, such as company directors, board members, trustees and councillors.</p>
<p>“Too often we find businesses that like to blame market forces or the government for their financial failure,” says Professor Mueller (MNZM) of Waikato Management School, who is one of the programme’s lecturers. “But in most cases, degrees of poor governance are the real reason why a business ends up falling over.”</p>
<p>This governance programme is aimed at creating successful business leaders who clearly understand their roles and responsibilities. Lectures will cover finance, corporate law, ethics, governance, strategy and leadership.</p>
<p>Throughout the duration of the nine month course, participants will attending three day teaching session and will be asked to put their skills to the test by completing a project focused on the organisation they work for in.</p>
