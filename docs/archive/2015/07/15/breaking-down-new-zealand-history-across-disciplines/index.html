<p><strong>Breaking down New Zealand history across disciplines</strong></p>
<p><strong>History @AUT, PUBLIC LECTURE SERIES 2015</strong></p>
<p>Mark Twain is reputed to have said that “History never repeats itself, but it does rhyme”. Similarly, there is an old Māori saying about the past always being before us. In a series of five lectures historians at AUT will explore this theme of linking the past, the present and the future in different areas of historical research.</p>
<p>One such area is the subject of the first lecture in the History @ AUT series, presented by Professor Rob Allen:</p>
<p><em>The Voice of the 99%: from the Knights of Labor to the Occupy Movement</em></p>
<p>Over the last 150 years, mainstream political parties within western democratic systems have been surrounded by populist organisations of both the right and the left, trying to provide an alternative voice. Using examples from the UK, the US and New Zealand, Professor Allen’s lecture will look at the different ways in which activists and agitators have sought to impact on the democratic process.<br>Co-ordinated by Professor Paul Moon, AUT’s Professor of History in the Faculty of Māori and Indigenous Development/Te Ara Poutama, the series aims to inform, stimulate, entertain and excite debate, in a historical context, within the many disciplines taught at AUT.</p>
<p>“AUT has a great variety of historians – they cover a broad range of subjects including social history, New Zealand history, communication design, physical therapy, and business.”</p>
<p>There are four more lectures in the series, with each lecture starting at 5.30pm in the Sir Paul Reeves Building, room WG404.</p>
<p><strong>Speakers and topics:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lecture one: Wednesday 15 July (today)</strong><br>Professor Rob Allen: <em>The Voice of the 99%: from the Knights of Labor to the Occupy Movement</em></p>
