<p><strong>New twist in state house sell-off saga</strong></p>
<p>The Government has opened the door to buyers of state houses simply being landlords and not required to provide social services, Labour’s Housing spokesperson Phil Twyford says.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said at his post-Cabinet press conference buyers would not “have to provide social services but they could potentially provide social services either of their own accord or in conjunction with someone else”.</p>
<p>Phil Twyford says this latest twist would allow a foreign company to buy billions of dollars’ worth of land and houses – make a killing on the capital gain – and just contract out the tenancy management and social services to a community group or form a ‘consortium’ with one.</p>
<p>“With Auckland house prices going up by $115,000 in the past year, foreign companies will have dollar signs in their eyes.</p>
<p>“This latest policy demolishes the Government’s claim its state house sell-off is about delivering better services to tenants. If a foreign company can buy up thousands of houses and contract out the tenancy services, why doesn’t the Government just keep the houses and contract out the services?</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister acknowledges that even troubled multinational prison operator Serco could buy the state houses by simply registering as a ‘community housing provider’ or entering into a consortium with one.</p>
<p>“Every pathetic justification for the state house sell off has fallen away as the Government has lurched from one desperate idea to the next.</p>
<p>“First the houses were in the wrong place and wrong size, then the Salvation Army and iwi were supposed to buy them, but that was not true. Then the sell-off was needed because local groups could do a better job. Now the Government wants to sell to offshore companies,” Phil Twyford says.</p>
