<p>Four University of Canterbury students win Todd Awards</p>
<p>Four University of Canterbury (UC) postgraduate students are among nine New Zealand university students to receive Todd Foundation Awards for Excellence.</p>
<p>The aim of the awards is to support projects that promote excellence and encourage the development of new concepts, technology or research that will be of benefit to New Zealand.</p>
<p>The UC students who received awards were Regine Morgenstern, Nicholas Lowther, James Hewett and Jarrod Cook.</p>
<p>Lowther, a Master of Science in medical physics student, has been awarded $10,000 and is investigating a real-time cardiac MRI tracking technique based on anatomical matching used for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (which triggers 20% of strokes), with radiosurgery.</p>
<p>Hewett, a PhD student, has been awarded $9000 for his research into computational fluid dynamics. His research will model the accumulation of unwanted fouling or scaling material in pipes and heat exchangers.</p>
<p>Morgenstern, who is completing a Master of Science degree in geological sciences, has been awarded $8500 for her research into mineral resources to help determine their future management or protection.</p>
<p>Cook, who is completing a Master of Engineering degree in mechanical engineering, has been awarded $7000 to develop, test and model a ratcheting, tension-only device to improve the performance of seismic energy dissipation mechanisms to avoid buckling, and protect buildings and their occupants during earthquakes.</p>

<p>UC Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) Professor Steve Weaver says to have four of the nine award recipients come from UC was outstanding.</p>
<p>“It is testament to the high quality, innovative research being undertaken by our postgraduate students and the excellent support they are receiving from our world-class teachers.”</p>
<p>The UC success in 2015 follows that of 2014 where four of the ten awardees were from UC.</p>
