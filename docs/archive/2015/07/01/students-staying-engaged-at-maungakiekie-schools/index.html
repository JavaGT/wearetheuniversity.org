<p><strong>Media Release</strong></p>
<p>1 July 2015</p>
<p><strong>Students staying engaged at local schools</strong></p>
<p>MP for Maungakiekie Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says there has been a significant drop in the number of students being suspended, stood-down, excluded and expelled from schools in the electorate.</p>
<p>“Under National, kids are staying in school longer and getting better results,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
<p>“Around New Zealand students are staying engaged in our classrooms. Latest figures show that since 2008, the number of suspensions in state and state-integrated schools has dropped 38 per cent.</p>
<p>“Here in Maungakiekie, stand-downs have dropped 6.7 per cent since 2008 and suspensions have fallen 19.1 per cent.</p>
<p>“Exclusions and expulsions have dropped by 24.9 per cent and 66.5 per cent respectively. These figures show we have more kids staying focused on their education.</p>
<p>“National has worked hard to offer more options for students to keep them engaged in learning, such as Trades Academies and Partnership Schools.</p>
<p>“We are supporting our teachers and school leaders to lift student achievement by helping them to collaborate and work together to share best practice in Communities of Schools.</p>
<p>“The Positive Behaviour for Learning (PB4L) programme is also helping create a more inclusive and supportive environment for students who need a bit more support.</p>
<p>“National is focusing on improving performance in the schooling system so every child has the opportunity to succeed, as we know high-quality education provides the opportunity for any child from any background to get ahead and make the most of their life,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
