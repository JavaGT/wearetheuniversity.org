<p><strong>Russell Street School funded to trial innovative teaching approaches</strong></p>
<p>List MP Jono Naylor says he can’t wait to see the results of the Russell Street School’s project in 18 months, which has been given $63,600.00 as part of a $10 million fund to encourage innovative teaching practices.</p>
<p>“I’m happy to see our local education providers working together for the benefit of children here in Palmerston North,” Jono Naylor said.</p>
<p>This collaborative inquiry project is about shifting teacher practice in ways that lead to students becoming more active learners, especially priority learners.</p>
<p>“The project is one of 39 selected in the first round of the Teacher-led Innovation Fund – part of National’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative. The initiative aims to encourage collaboration between schools and lift teaching practice.”</p>
<p>This current funding round is committing about $2.6 million of the $10 million fund. The next funding round will open in November.</p>
<p>“These projects will trial new ways of doing things, and undertake important research. National’s unrelenting focus is on raising achievement for all students, and where these projects are successful, other schools will be able to learn from the successes,” Naylor said.</p>
