<p>UC athletes competing at World University Games</p>
<p>Six University of Canterbury athletes are representing New Zealand at the World University Games in Gwangiu, South Korea.</p>
<p>Angie Petty, Brad Mathas, Daniel Balchin, Fiona Morrison and Kelsey Berryman will be competing in athletics, with Jonathan Wang competing in table tennis.</p>
<p>UC Sport Manager Grant Robertson says these students will represent the University and New Zealand to a very high standard.</p>
<p>“These athletes will be aiming to peak for this major event in their sporting careers. If all their hard work, preparation and planning comes together we will see some outstanding results,” says Robertson.</p>
<p>“This is a pinnacle event for these athletes. The World University Games is the second largest only to the Olympics so it is a significant step in their sporting career.”</p>
<p>Robertson says UC Sport has been involved with a number of the athletes through their association with High Performance Sport New Zealand and Athletics New Zealand.</p>
<p>Angie Petty finished fourth in the 800m and 1500m at the last Games held in Kazan, Russia in 2013.</p>
<p>The World University Games is held every two years for student athletes from around the world. This year more than 13,000 athletes from 141 countries will be competing in Gwangju for the 28th biennial event. This compares to around 10,000 competitors from 205 nations at an Olympic Games.</p>
<p>The Games run from 3-14 July in Gwangju, South Korea.</p>
