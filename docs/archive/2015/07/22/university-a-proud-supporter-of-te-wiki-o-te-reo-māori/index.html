<p><strong>University a proud supporter of Te Wiki o Te Reo Māori</strong></p>
<p>Te Whare Wānanga o Waikato (the University of Waikato) is once again supporting Te Wiki o te Reo Māori – Māori Language Week.</p>
<p>The theme for this year is Whāngaihia Te Reo ki ngā Mātua – nurture the language in parents so that it may grow.</p>
<p>Pro Vice-Chancellor Māori, Professor Linda Smith, says Māori Language Week is an opportunity for staff and students, from beginners to fluent speakers, to embrace and use the language.</p>
<p>“Our culture is strong at Waikato and we continually strive to provide culturally rich and diverse experiences for staff and students. Don’t be afraid to give te reo a go. Te Wiki o Te Reo Māori provides an opportunity for everyone to try and say a few words without feeling whakamā (embarrassed).”</p>
<p>The University has a strong history in language revitalisation, and teaching and research excellence in te reo Māori. To celebrate Te Wiki o te Reo Māori, which runs from from 27 July – 2 August, the University will host a number of activities on campus for staff, students and the wider community.</p>
<p>During the week there will be a word hunt competition for staff and students, and a staff Dress Your Space competition encouraging staff to label their reception areas, tea rooms and hallways with kupu (Māori words).</p>
<p>There will also be three presentations that are free and open to the public. Professor Pou Temara’s presentation is called Imagine, and is on Monday 27 July from 12-2pm in room 1.01 in S Block.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley will speak on language and culture on Tuesday 28 July from 12-2pm at Waikato Management School, room MSB.1.05.</p>
<p>The third presentation is by the Honorable Te Ururoa Flavell on Friday 31 July, from 3pm-4pm in room 1.05 in S Block.</p>
