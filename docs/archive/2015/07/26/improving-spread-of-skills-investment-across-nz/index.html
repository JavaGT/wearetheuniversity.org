<p><strong>Sunday, 26 July 2015, 12:25 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Improving spread of skills, investment across NZ</strong></p>
<p>The Government will introduce a package of immigration measures aimed at improving the spread of workers, skills and investment across New Zealand, Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse says.</p>
<p>“Thousands of people from all over the world are moving to New Zealand because it is a good place to live, work and raise a family,” Mr Woodhouse says.</p>
<p>“Those people make a significant contribution to New Zealand’s economic growth by providing skills, labour and capital we need, along with valuable cultural and business links.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders will always be first in line for jobs and that won’t change,” Mr Woodhouse says.</p>
<p>“Currently, many new migrants settle in Auckland, which faces infrastructure challenges as it transforms into a truly international city. At the same time, business owners in other parts of New Zealand often struggle to find enough skilled workers to meet their demands.</p>
<p>“While there are already incentives to encourage migrants to move to areas outside of Auckland, we can do a better job of matching the needs of regionswith available migrants and investors,” Mr Woodhouse says.</p>
<p>New measures to take effect from 1 November include:</p>
<p>• Boosting the bonus points for Skilled Migrants applying for residence with a job offer outside Auckland from 10 to 30 points.</p>
<p>• Doubling the points for entrepreneurs planning to set up businesses in the regions under the Entrepreneur Work Visa from 20 to 40 points.</p>

<p>• Streamlining the labour market test to provide employers with more certainty, earlier in the visa application process.</p>
<p>In addition, from mid-2016 a pathway to residence will be provided for a limited number of long-term migrants on temporary work visas in the South Island.</p>
<p>“Unemployment across the Mainland is nearly half that of the North Island, and labour is in short supply,” Mr Woodhouse says.</p>
<p>“Most workers in lower skilled jobs must apply to renew their work visas every year. Some of these people have worked hard and paid tax to New Zealand for many years. They are valued at work and in their community, but have no avenue to settle here permanently.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at offering residence to some migrants, who have applied at least five times for their annual work visa. In return, we will require them to commit to the South Island regions where they’ve put down roots.”</p>
<p>Mr Woodhouse says the Government is also considering a new Global Impact Visa to attract high-impact entrepreneurs, investors and start-up teams to launch global ventures from New Zealand.</p>
<p>“I will announce further details later this year, but we envisage this visa would be offered to a limited number of younger, highly talented, successful and well-connected entrepreneurs from places like Silicon Valley,” Mr Woodhouse says.</p>
