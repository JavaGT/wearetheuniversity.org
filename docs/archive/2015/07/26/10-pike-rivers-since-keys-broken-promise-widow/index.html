<p><strong>10 Pike Rivers since Key&#39;s &quot;broken&quot; promise - widow</strong></p>
<p>• <em>Silent Vigil with 291 crosses held on Federal street between Wellesley and Victoria Streets today.</em><br>• <em>Setup from 7am to 8am with pack down 10am to 11am.</em>  </p>
<p>A family will hold a silent vigil with 291 crosses as the Prime Minister gives his key-note speech in Auckland today.</p>
<p>John Key is speaking at the National Party annual conference at Skycity.</p>
<p>Deborah McMillan&#39;s husband Shane was killed at work in 2009. A branch fell on him while he was working in a forestry gang near Napier.</p>
<p>Their eight year-old daughter Skylar was three at the time.</p>
<p>Mrs McMillan says 290 of the crosses represent workers who have died at work since 2010.</p>
<p>She says Skylar will place her dad&#39;s work jacket and a helmet on the 291st cross.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ve had ten Pike Rivers since John Key promised to improve work safety laws in 2010,&quot; she says. &quot;Not only has he broken his promise, he wants to make it worse.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister began a review of the Health and Safety in Employment Act after 29 miners died at Pike River.</p>
<p>The Government announced their proposed law changes last Friday.</p>
<p>McMillan says the National Party wants to exclude worker health and safety reps from small businesses.</p>
<p>“It’s an awful double kick in the guts for us. Shane died working in a small business.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of the Pike River men worked in small businesses too.&quot;</p>
<p>The Department of Labour statistics show workers in small companies are 35% more likely to have an accident at work.</p>

<p>The Council of Trade Unions (CTU) is helping the McMillan family put up the crosses.</p>
<p>CTU spokesperson Strachan Crang says Business New Zealand and unions support retaining health and safety reps in small businesses.</p>
<p>“A minority of small businesses lobbied the Government to water down the bill,&quot; he says. &quot;They included farmers and other industries with a terrible track record for workplace safety.&quot;</p>
<p>They are playing politics with workers lives, Crang says.</p>
<p>Deborah McMillan says it is hard for her daughter growing up without a dad.</p>
<p>“It&#39;s gotten harder as Skylar grows up and understands more of what happened. She&#39;s had to have counselling.”</p>
<p>Despite these difficulties, she says she won&#39;t stop fighting until work safety laws improve.</p>
<p>&quot;No family should have to go through what we did. It&#39;s been horrible.&quot;</p>
