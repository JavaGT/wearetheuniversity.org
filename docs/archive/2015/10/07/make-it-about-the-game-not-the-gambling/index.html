<p>Make it about the game, not the gambling</p>
<p>A group of AUT University students will use a high powered projector to show an animated short film highlighting the risks of sports betting outside the Saint James Theatre in Lorne Street this Friday 9 October from 7.45-9pm.</p>
<p>The University of Sydney’s Gambling Treatment Clinic has identified online betting in Australia as a spiralling phenomenon over the past three years. Upon investigation, the students found that the current Rugby World Cup games have been inundated with TAB advertisements encouraging New Zealanders to participate in sports betting.</p>
<p>“We were shocked to find that New Zealanders spent over $32 million at the TAB betting on the 2011 Rugby World Cup,” said AUT University public relations student Alexia Morris.</p>
<p>“We are concerned that a culture of sports betting is creeping into New Zealand’s sports.”</p>
<p>The animated film was created to bring attention to the consequences of sports betting, especially for young males. The film, designed by AUT University design student, Javeria Lijima, tells the story of John, an animated character, who watches a live rugby game with his friends. John is faced with decisions around sports betting and comes face to face with the potential consequences.</p>
<p>Morris said the projection provides a creative perspective on a hard hitting issue that is relevant to New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“While not everyone will develop a gambling problem, we want to highlight the risks associated with sports betting and encourage New Zealanders to enjoy the actual game, rather than focus on the betting,” said Andree Froude, Marketing and Communications Director at the Problem Gambling Foundation of New Zealand.</p>
<p>The students say their message is simple; ‘make it about the game, not the gambling’.</p>
