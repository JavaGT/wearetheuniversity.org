<p>The Auckland University Canoe Club</p>
<p>The Auckland University Canoe Club, one of the oldest on campus, has won the top prize at the University of Auckland annual club awards. The Food Appreciation Society, or FAS, won General Club of the Year.</p>
<p>The Canoe Club was established 66 years ago and today boasts some 350 members, ranging in age from 17 to 50. It also received Sports Club of the Year and President Carey Lintott won Club President of the Year.</p>
<p>Carey praised the hard work of her executive in getting members out on the water as the reason behind the club’s success.</p>
<p>“We are an extremely active club and have a solid group of instructors out on the river at every opportunity, both to help teach our new members, and to test their own limits. We also have a great new group of up-and-coming paddlers who will be able to pass on their skills to new members in 2016.”</p>
<p>The judging committee praised the Canoe Club for expanding its range of activities to include, for example, competitive rafting for the first time this year and promoting involvement in nationally competitive events.</p>
<p>The Canoe Club offers safety courses, in-the-water training, weekend trips to some of the most remote places in New Zealand, and competitive opportunities in kayaking and white water rafting.</p>
<p>The Food Appreciation Society was established at a pot luck dinner last year. Its membership has quickly grown from about 40 to an impressive 800 this year.</p>
<p>FAS hosts dinners at various Auckland restaurants sampling cuisines from around the world, holds a food quiz night and BYO dinner, and members volunteer at food-related fundraising events.</p>
<p>University of Auckland Clubs Administrator Julia Hohl says with over 200 clubs on campus there is something for every student’s taste.</p>
<p>“Joining a club is a great way to balance your academic career with something that takes you away from the books and gets you into an activity that you&#39;ve never tried before,” she says.</p>
<p>“It can help you feel connected, meet new people, and put your classroom learning to the test in real world experiences.”</p>
<p>Other major award winners were the Auckland University Strength and Powerlifting Association for New Club of the Year; Kiwi Asian Club for Cultural Club of the Year; and the University of Auckland Anime and Manga Club for People’s Choice.</p>
