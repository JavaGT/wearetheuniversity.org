<p>Prestigious scholarship for Māori student  </p>
<p>A Lincoln University Master’s student has been awarded a prestigious scholarship that aims to increase Māori participation in the fisheries and aquaculture industries.</p>
<p>Roxanne Lloyd, who is studying towards a Master of Applied Science in Environmental Management, received the Rona Scholarship at the recent 2015 Ngā Whetū Hei Whai: Charting Pathways for Māori Industry Future Conference.</p>
<p>Each year, the Te Pūtea Whakatupu Trust awards up to 10 of these scholarships to Māori who are completing degrees in fisheries, aquaculture or marine sciences.</p>
<p>“It was great to be given the opportunity to go to the Ngā Whetū Hei Whai conference,” Ms Lloyd says. “There were a number of inspiring speakers, such as Sir Mason Durie, Dr Ernesto Sirolli and the Minister of Māori Development, Hon Te Ururoa Flavell.</p>
<p>“All the speakers encouraged and inspired us to work hard and achieve our goals as Māori. The conference was a chance to network with people from different fields. I think the people I met and the relationships I made at the conference will help me achieve my goals and future plans.”</p>
<p>Ms Lloyd’s Master’s research involves exploring the pattern of marine farm locations throughout New Zealand and investigating how climate change can play a role in determining the best sites for such farms.</p>
<p>“Climate change can affect a number of important resources that humans rely on,” she says. “In particular, aquaculture provides a food source, but an increase in water temperature or ocean acidification can alter the environments needed to farm certain species.”</p>

<p>Her research involves mapping the marine farm locations using GIS and agent-based modelling.</p>
<p>“I have always had an interest in GIS, and have been able to learn a new skill while carrying out this research.”</p>
<p>Ms Lloyd started working towards her Master’s degree at Lincoln in April this year, after completing an undergraduate degree and postgraduate diploma at the University of Canterbury.</p>
<p>“I decided to make the change to Lincoln for my Master’s thesis because I wanted to take part in research that would help improve the way in which humans use and manage the environment and its resources.”</p>
