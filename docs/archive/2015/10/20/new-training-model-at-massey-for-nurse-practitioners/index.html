<p><strong>New training model at Massey for nurse practitioners</strong></p>
<p>Monday, October 19, 2015</p>
<p>Massey University’s School of Nursing is a key player in the Government’s newly announced 12-month trial of a training model for nurse practitioners, designed to speed up the time between students completing their studies and starting employment.</p>
<p>Nursing schools from Massey University and the University of Auckland are partnering to deliver the programme for 20 nurse practitioners, from next year.</p>
<p>Professor Jenny Carryer, from the School of Nursing says, “Massey University has been preparing nurse practitioners for many years now, usually as part time students, through the very successful Master of Nursing programme. This new funding will enable a cohort of candidates to spend a full time year completing the degree.</p>
<p>“This new group of candidates will have a much closer connection between their academic preparation and their clinical experience during the programme.”</p>
<p>Professor Carryer says the initiative is hugely important. “Students will have an employer guaranteed position as a nurse practitioner once they have been authorised by the Nursing Council of New Zealand when they finish their studies.</p>
<p>“Nurse practitioners are an increasingly critical component of sustainable health service delivery, especially in primary health care, aged care and mental health sectors.”</p>
