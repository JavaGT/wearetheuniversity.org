<p><strong>Monday October 12, 2015</strong><br><strong>Star studded line-up for 25th Blues Sports Awards</strong></p>
<p>Some of the biggest names in sport will receive 2015 Massey University Blues Sports Awards this week – but who will be named Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year?</p>
<p>The awards, now in their 25th year, are the highest sporting accolade given in the New Zealand tertiary system, and part of a tradition dating back to 1922.</p>
<p>2015 Blues recipients from the Albany campus include Tall Black Mika Vukona, Black Stick Gemma Flynn, paralympian alpine skier Corey Peters and yachting gold medalist Jo Aleh.</p>
<p>Gemma Flynn and Jo Aleh are also nominees for the Massey University Distance Student Sportswoman of the Year, along with:</p>
<p>Abby Young – Football<br>Zoe McBride – Rowing<br>Mary Fisher – Swimming<br>Molly Meech – Yachting</p>
<p>Massey University Distance Student Sportsman of the Year nominees:</p>
<p>Corey Peters – Alpine Ski Racing<br>Mika Vukona – Basketball<br>Matthew Cameron – BMX<br>George Worker – Cricket<br>Alistair Bond – Rowing<br>James Hunter – Rowing</p>
<p>These awards are for students studying via distance learning. They highlight Massey University’s longstanding reputation for providing the highest level of flexibility, tailored to the life of the high-performing athlete. As a result of this dedication, Massey was the first in New Zealand to be named an athlete-friendly university by High Performance Sport New Zealand.</p>
<p>BNZ Bank has been a principal sponsor of the Blues since 1995. The BNZ Trophy is presented to the top performing Sportsman and Sportswoman from each of Massey’s three campuses in Auckland, Manawatu and Wellington.</p>
