<p>One last chance to stop power grab in Canterbury</p>
<p>Today Parliament has one last chance to stop the Government’s ECan power grab, by voting to restore a fully elected regional council, says Labour’s Environment spokesperson Megan Woods.</p>
<p>“Before question time today I will seek leave of the House to table my member’s bill which would restore a fully elected ECan right away.</p>
<p>“If my bill is passed, it will stop National’s power grab plan to keep some unelected commissioners in place for years.</p>
<p>“There is no good reason that Cantabrians are any less deserving of the right to elect their own representatives than people in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>“Even some of the government’s own support partners are publically opposed to their plan, and their own officials.”</p>
<p>“Public submissions on the government’s proposal were overwhelmingly negative. Only 16 of 534 submissions on the discussion document supported the government’s plan.</p>
<p>Today, parliament can show it has listened to people in Canterbury, and trusts them to make their own decisions,” says Megan Woods.</p>
