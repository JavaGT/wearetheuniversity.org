<p><strong>Hutt students recognised with Kupe scholarships</strong></p>
<p>National List MP based in the Hutt Valley Chris Bishop is congratulating two young Hutt Valley scholars for each receiving a prestigious Kupe Scholarship at a ceremony in Wellington. Hosted by the Minister of Education Hon Hekia Parata, Erin Edmonds of Upper Hutt and Pasifika Scholar Lealofi Fuataga of Lower Hutt have both become 2015 Kupe Scholars.</p>
<p>The Kupe Scholarship attracts and supports young, highly talented Māori and Pasifika to complete their teaching studies and successfully become inspiring teachers and role models. Kupe Scholars receive a scholarship of $15,000 plus tuition fees for an approved teaching qualification. This is the inaugural year for these Scholarships.</p>
<p>“Once again the Hutt Valley has produced two outstanding young scholars. I offer my wholehearted congratulations to both Erin and Lealofi and acknowledge their academic achievements, leadership in the community, and passion and commitment to passing these attributes on to other students,” says Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>“We want to inspire and support talented people into the teaching profession. Kupe Scholarships do just that by recognising outstanding Māori and Pasifika student teachers.</p>
<p>“It is fitting that these Scholarships are named after Kupe who displayed courageous leadership to overcome many obstacles during his voyage across the Pacific. Our Hutt Scholars also demonstrate this leadership, embrace diversity and bring energy and enthusiasm to teaching.</p>

<p>“I am not surprised that we have two Scholars from the Hutt Valley being recognised with these awards. The Hutt is full of inspiring young leaders who contribute a great deal to our community. I am proud to see Erin and Lealofi have been given a scholarship which will help them with course fees and a study allowance.”</p>
<p>The Kupe Scholarships are new and were presented in a ceremony at Pipitea Marae by the Minister of Education, more information is available here:<a href="https://www.teachnz.govt.nz/scholarships/kupe-scholars/">https://www.teachnz.govt.nz/scholarships/kupe-scholars/</a>.</p>
