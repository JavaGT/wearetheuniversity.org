<p><strong>Waikato students win inaugural Kupe Scholarships</strong></p>
<p>Seven Māori and Pasifika student teachers from the University of Waikato were awarded Kupe Scholarships by the Education Minister Hekia Parata last week.</p>
<p>The Kupe Scholarship attracts young, highly-talented Māori and Pasifika to the teaching profession and helps them become inspiring teachers and role models of success in early childhood, primary and secondary education.</p>
<p>With only 30 scholarships offered, the scholarship is awarded to students with strong academic success who want to become teachers.</p>
<p>Mitchell Zandstra is currently studying towards a Graduate Diploma in Secondary Teaching.</p>
<p>“The Kupe Scholarship was a huge honour to receive on behalf of myself and my family. It has been my intention and motivation for a long time to help increase Māori and Pasifika achievement within secondary school education. This scholarship supports and helps me strive towards these education goals. Being a physical education and health teacher, I believe I can make a difference in students lives and guide them in their academic journey,” Mitchell says.</p>
<p>Ivan Kana says to be recognised as a teacher in training for a career he is passionate about is amazing.</p>
<p>“This scholarship has definitely enhanced and supported my development in becoming the best teacher I can be. With my education and scholarship I hope to motivate and teach people of all ages, genders and ethnicities. I am very passionate about supporting others to succeed and be recognised positively and this scholarship has opened new doors and created networks that will undoubtedly support me in the future.”</p>

<p>Viani Ward says the Kupe Scholarship is a blessing. “I’m am really grateful to be a recipient of this prestigious award. I look forward to teaching and sharing my knowledge with our tamariki. I hope to be an accounting and business teacher. My future goal is to keep learning te reo and add that to my teaching portfolio.”</p>
<p>The scholarship funds course fees, study allowances and offers professional mentoring and recruitment support after graduation.</p>
<p>As recognition of their achievement the recipients received taonga keepsakes in the form of a stylised paddle ‘hoe’ or waka / vaka / va’a.</p>
