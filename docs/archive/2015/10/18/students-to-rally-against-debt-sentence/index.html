<p>Students to rally against Debt Sentence</p>
<p>17 October 2015</p>
<p>In the last ten years fees at New Zealand’s largest university, the University of Auckland, have gone up 50.82%, or by over $2,400 per student per year. In the last five years alone fees have shot up by $1,400 (or 24.64%).</p>
<p>Now students are being asked to bear a growing burden at a time when nearly half of full time students struggle to pay the rent, and most are giving up on aspirations of home ownership in the city they love. The future looks increasingly bleak for Generation Debt.</p>
<p>Student debt reaches $15 Billion in February 2016, and the University of Auckland Council intends to add to it on Monday. Students have had enough, and we’ll be rallying against our growing Debt Sentence.</p>
