<p><strong>Detainees isolated and desperate</strong></p>
<p>New Zealanders in Australia’s remote Christmas Island Detention Centre have spoken about the trauma of being locked up thousands of miles away from their families in a facility designed to house people considered to be a terrorism threat.</p>
<p>Labour’s Corrections spokesperson Kelvin Davis gained access to some of the 40 New Zealanders being detained while appealing against their deportations yesterday.</p>
<p>He says the five hour visit was highly emotional: “We were able to hear about all the alleged human rights violations and assess their health and well-being.</p>
<p>“They’re angry, hungry, traumatised and so desperate to return to their homes in Australia they are even considering rioting.</p>
<p>“These New Zealand born Australians are not murderers or rapists. They have served their time yet Australian authorities are treating them as though they are a terrorism threat.</p>
<p>“The stories of the eight detainees we met were all consistent. They hate the isolation, the lack of family contact, and the lack of contact with legal support.</p>
<p>“None of them want to take up John Key’s proposal to return to New Zealand to settle their visa applications. They think it’s a trick designed to prevent them from returning to their families and jobs in Australia.”</p>
<p>He said he was grateful to Australia Border Force superintendent Maritime Operations WA, Mark Wilson, who allowed the five hour visit.</p>
<p>“We were drug tested on arrival, then escorted into an airless visit room where the detainees were brought in two at a time for 30 minute visits.</p>

<p>“We weren’t allowed to film or record their stories so we sat and yarned, laughed and cried about their plight.</p>
<p>“We also took a box of chocolates for Ricardo Young who turns 30 today, and whose family asked us to take him a cake after we met them in Sydney. However such is the ridiculousness of the rules the authorities couldn’t decide if he was allowed the chocolates.</p>
<p>“These people are not terrorist threats and they don’t deserve to be locked up thousands of kilometres away from their families,” Kelvin Davis said.</p>
