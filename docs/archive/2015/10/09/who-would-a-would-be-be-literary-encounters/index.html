<p><strong>Who Would a Would-Be Be: Literary Encounters</strong></p>
<p>Murray Edmond</p>
<p>In this lecture, the poet, critic, dramatist and soon-to-be fiction writer, Murray Edmond, will evoke his youthful and formative meetings with well-known New Zealand literary figures, including Frank Sargeson, Kendrick Smithyman, Mary Stanley, James K. Baxter, Hone Tuwhare, R.A.K.Mason, Denis Glover and Charles Brasch. Like Frank Sargeson, Murray grew up in Hamilton. His formative literary experiences come from their shared roots.</p>
<p>Murray has published thirteen books of poems. <em>Letters and Paragraphs</em> (1987) and <em>Fool Moon</em> (2005) were New Zealand Book Awards finalists. His latest volume of poems is <em>Shaggy Magpie Songs</em> (2015) from Auckland University Press. Murray has also been active in experimental and innovative theatre companies (The Living Theatre Troupe, Half Moon Theatre in London, Theatre Action, Town and Country Players and Indian Ink Theatre Company) and for over 25 years taught theatre and drama at the University of Auckland. He works as the dramaturge for Indian Ink Theatre Company, whose latest play, <em>Kiss the Fish</em>, was awarded Best New Play of 2014 in the Chapman Tripp Awards.</p>
