<p><strong>Christchurch needs more than just the new Bus Exchange</strong></p>
<p>Christchurch deserves a co-ordinated transport agency with a region-wide plan, not just the new Bus Exchange that Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee is visiting today, said the Green Party.</p>
<p>“The National Government is tinkering around the edges when it comes to public transport, but what we need is a coordinated regional transport agency that’s able to make smart planning decisions for all the people who live and work in Canterbury,” Green Party Christchurch spokesperson Eugenie Sage said.</p>
<p>“The Green Party <a href="https://www.greens.org.nz/policy/smarter-economy/greener-christchurch">has a plan</a> to get Christchurch and Canterbury moving with a single organisation, responsible for transport strategy, planning, and service delivery.</p>
<p>“The new Bus Exchange has been a great addition to the central city, but we need a step change to improve transport options and reduce traffic congestion.</p>
<p>“Cantabrians make more than 14 million public transport trips every year, but the public transport system is underfunded.</p>
<p>“Traffic congestion in greater Christchurch increased 40 percent from 2009 to 2013 and is predicted to increase further. Without a co-ordinated approach to transport planning for all Canterbury, we run the risk of gridlock and traffic hassles becoming all too frequent.</p>
<p>“Auckland Transport has been transformational in getting Auckland moving in a coordinated way, and shows why we need a similar Canterbury Transport agency,” said Ms Sage.</p>
