<p>Youth Awards sponsors confirmed</p>
<p>A huge number of Hutt Valley businesses and organisations have been confirmed for the inaugural Hutt City Youth Awards, a new initiative designed to shine a light on talented young people in Hutt City.</p>
<p>Chair of the organising committee, Chris Bishop MP, says that he and the organising committee have been overwhelmed by the response from local organisations.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see the community getting behind this new initiative. Thanks to all who have come on board as sponsors and supporters.</p>
<p>“The platinum sponsor is WelTec, which is highly appropriate as a tertiary institution with a significant Hutt presence, educating and training our young people.</p>
<p>“Each of the eight award categories have major sponsors as well. The prizes for each category winner include both a monetary prize, as well as a special experience for each winner that will help them in the future – such as a mentorship or support.”</p>
<p>Sponsors of the award categories are:</p>
<p>• Westpac (sponsor of the Award for Overcoming Adversity)<br>•<br>• Label and Litho (sponsor of the Leadership award)<br>•<br>• The Hodge Group (entrepreneurship)<br>•<br>• Weltec (service to the community)<br>•<br>• GNS Science (science and technology)<br>•<br>• The Dowse Art Museum (the arts)<br>•<br>• Ignite Sport (contribution to sport)<br>•<br>• Natraj School of Dance (tolerance and diversity)</p>
<p>Other sponsors include Hutt City Council, the Hutt Valley Chamber of Commerce, Ignite Sport, Pete’s Emporium, and Hutt Radio.</p>
