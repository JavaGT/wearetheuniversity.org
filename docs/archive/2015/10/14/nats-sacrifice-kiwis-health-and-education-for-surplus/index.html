<p>Nats sacrifice Kiwis’ health and education for surplus</p>
<p>National’s drive for surplus has meant less investment in critical areas like health, education, housing and transport – yet John Key told Parliament today he wants the money for cycleways, Labour’s Finance spokesperson Grant Robertson says.</p>
<p>“The Government’s belated surplus has been partly achieved by dropping spending by $235m in education, $97m on housing and community development, $52m in health and over $300m on transport and communications.</p>
<p>“These are critical areas. Too many students are failing NCEA, dilapidated state houses are making people sick, patients are waiting far too long in hospital emergency departments and regional roads and internet services are in desperate need of upgrades.</p>
<p>“It also appears that $444m has been taken out of the EQC claims budget. No one in Canterbury waiting for repairs or needing their repairs redone would think that money isn’t needed.</p>
<p>“Bill English says this is the Government saving money but the truth is he is trying to cover his Budget blushes and belatedly scrape together a surplus.</p>
<p>“Incredibly now the Government is in surplus John Key doesn’t want to fix these critical areas – he wants to spend the money on more cycleways.</p>
<p>“The next time Kiwis find themselves waiting for an operation, getting sick in their home, worrying about their children’s performance at school, or nearly crashing on a dodgy road they can thank their lucky stars Bill English has a surplus and John Key has his cycleways,” Grant Robertson says.</p>
