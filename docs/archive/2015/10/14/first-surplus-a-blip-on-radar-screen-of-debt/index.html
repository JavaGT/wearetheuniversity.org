<p>Grant Robertson</p>
<p>Finance Spokesperson</p>

<p><strong>First surplus a blip on radar screen of debt</strong></p>
<p>Bill English’s first surplus is just one black drop in a sea of red, with New Zealanders still paying over $10m a day in interest payments, Labour’s Finance spokesperson Grant Robertson says.</p>
<p>“The Finance Minister has finally found a surplus needle in his haystack of debt. Despite promising a ‘significant’ surplus, it’s just $414m. That’s less than 0.2 per cent of GDP – a rounding error, not a surplus.</p>
<p>“Gross debt is more than $86 billion – the highest since Rob Muldoon stalked the corridors of the power. Interest payments alone are now $13 million a day and rise to $15m a day in three years.</p>
<p>“Instead of running a budget with revenue easily outstripping spending, National only reached surplus by manipulating the books – delaying spending on the Canterbury rebuild, underspending in health and education, and overcharging ACC by $350m.</p>
<p>“Without such trickery National would be in deficit again.</p>
<p>“And that’s at the peak of the economic cycle when New Zealanders would rightly expect the books to be in the black.</p>
<p>“But the surplus show is over before it has begun. With the economy running out of steam, National’s promises of a string of surpluses are extremely unlikely to become reality. That’s poor financial management.</p>
<p>“There is very little for National to crow about in its accounts.</p>
<p>“National’s financial management will go down in history as one small surplus – at the peak of the economic cycle – out of nine Budget deficits.</p>

<p>“At the peak of the cycle the previous Labour Government was able to post a surplus of $7 billion and had unemployment below 4 per cent, compared to nearly 6 per cent now. National likes to say it’s the party of economic credibility but on the surplus score it’s 9-1 to Labour over the last two governments.</p>
<p>“John Key and Bill English might want to pop the champagne corks for finally getting a surplus but in the absence of a plan for regional economic growth, decent work and higher wages it will leave most New Zealanders feeling pretty flat,” Grant Robertson says.</p>
