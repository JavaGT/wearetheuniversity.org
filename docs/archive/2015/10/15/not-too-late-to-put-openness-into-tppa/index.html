<p>Fletcher Tabuteau MP</p>
<p>Spokesperson for Trade<br>15 OCTOBER 2015</p>
<p>Not Too Late to Put Openness into TPPA</p>
<p>Parliament was asked today to fast-track the International Transparent Treaties Bill to bring transparency and openness to international treaties and agreements.</p>
<p>“It’s not too late to apply this law to the TPPA so New Zealanders can have a say through Parliament,” says New Zealand First Spokesperson on Trade Fletcher Tabuteau</p>
<p>“The government has been secretive during TPPA negotiations and ignored the rights of hundreds of thousands of Kiwis who want to know details before their rights are signed away.</p>
<p>“Yesterday our attempt to restore democracy was shot down by National’s senior whip Tim Macindoe and ACT leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“The government had a chance to mull over what democracy means overnight and, if true to the meaning, would have supported the Bill, but it did not.</p>
<p>“Transparency is crucial as currently small, privileged and often out-of-touch groups are negotiating these deals on behalf of the wider public.</p>
<p>“We don’t want any more blank cheque commitments on behalf of New Zealanders.”</p>
<p>“The International Transparent Treaties Bill would give Parliament or select committees the right to examine and review the terms of the TPPA or any other international treaty before it is signed,” says Mr Tabuteau.</p>
