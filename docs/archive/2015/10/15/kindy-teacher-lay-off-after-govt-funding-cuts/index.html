<p>Kindy teacher lay off after Govt funding cuts</p>
<p>Government funding cuts are hitting home with kindergartens being forced to lay off teachers, Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>Whānau Manaaki Kindergartens – formally the Wellington and Rimutaka Kindergarten Association – this week wrote to parents advising them that Government funding cuts meant they would have to make changes to ensure their 85 kindergartens and home-based services stay viable.</p>
<p>“The letter says that since a 14 per cent cut to kindergarten funding in 2010, the Government has failed to ensure annual funding is adjusted for inflation – meaning kindergartens have had to absorb further funding cuts every year.</p>
<p>“Whānau Manaaki has warned there will be forced redundancies if not enough teachers agree to reduce their hours. Other options include reducing non-contact time for teachers and opening longer to increase the income kindergartens receive.</p>
<p>“This kindergarten association rightly remains committed to having qualified teachers because evidence shows they provide the best outcomes for young children.</p>
<p>“However, the Government has pushed for increased participation to meet arbitrary targets at the expense of educational quality.</p>
<p>“Labour has a strong record on early childhood education. The former Labour government is proud to have introduced the 20 hours free policy which has helped so many families.</p>
<p>“We remain committed to increasing the number of qualified teachers working with our youngest students.</p>
<p>“The Government’s funding cuts are shortsighted and will have lasting ramifications for children, parents, teachers and the wider school community,” Chris Hipkins says.</p>
