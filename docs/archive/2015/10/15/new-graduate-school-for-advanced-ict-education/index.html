<p><strong>Thursday, 15 October 2015, 9:57 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>New graduate school will set the standard for advanced ICT education in Wellington</strong></p>
<p>The new Wellington ICT Graduate School is expected to deliver a wealth of benefits to the capital city and fuel growth across the region and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Government has confirmed that the Wellington Graduate School will be a partnership between Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington Institute of Technology and Whitireia Polytechnic with strong involvement from a number of Wellington ICT firms, start-ups and leaders in the capital’s technology eco-system.</p>
<p>The School will provide practically-focused postgraduate programmes that will equip graduates with the skills and attributes sought by industry.</p>
<p>“This is an excellent opportunity for Wellington, which is a high performer in terms of New Zealand’s ICT-related GDP,” says Professor Mike Wilson, Pro Vice-Chancellor of the Faculties of Science, Architecture and Design and Engineering at Victoria University.</p>
<p>“The Wellington region has the highest concentration of web and digital-based companies per capita in New Zealand and the new Graduate ICT School will provide a pipeline of graduates with the skills and research capacity to ensure those companies thrive.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be able to join with other tertiary providers in Wellington to leverage our existing networks, resources and education capabilities to develop a school that will lead to a pool of ICT talent and collaborative research partnerships.”</p>
<p>The Chief Executive of WelTec and Whitireia Chris Gosling, says that the ICT Graduate School is a great example of collaboration between Wellington’s leading tertiary education providers, working directly with industry partners, to provide high quality graduates.</p>

<p>“ICT is a fast-paced and rapidly-changing industry, which demands innovative approaches to education and training. The new Graduate School has been established to respond to that need”, Mr Gosling says.</p>
<p>Consultation with industry has informed design of the qualifications to be offered by the School. These include a Master of Software Development focused on developing real-world software-based systems and a Master of Information Technology, which is designed to sharpen the technical skills and knowledge of those already in industry or who have a Bachelor’s in an ICT or computing-related discipline and seeking to enter the ICT workforce.</p>
<p>A Master of Engineering Practice will also be available through the School and aims to give students the skills to design and implement engineering solutions.</p>
<p>Qualifications that offer specialisation in emerging creative technologies and user experience design are expected to be offered further down the track.</p>
<p>Students will enrol at the new school, which is due to open in Trimester 2 2016, through Victoria University, WelTec and Whitireia, with many of the courses to be offered in the CBD.</p>
<p>The Graduate School will be closely connected with the Wellington Tech Hub, established by the Wellington City Council and Biz Dojo, to provide a place for the tech community to connect, collaborate and generate new and exciting ideas.</p>
<p>The Tech Hub will provide a point of engagement between ICT firms and the Wellington ICT Graduate School, a base for the School’s non-academic staff and a venue to deliver workshops, bootcamps, competitions and networking events.</p>
