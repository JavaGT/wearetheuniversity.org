<p>Auckland houses skyrocket $300k in 5 years</p>
<p>The Government’s refusal to take effective steps to solve the Auckland housing crisis is highlighted in new figures showing prices in our biggest city skyrocketed by $300,000 in the past five years, Labour’s Housing spokesperson Phil Twyford says.</p>
<p>“Generation Rent is being further locked out of the dream of homeownership, while house prices in many regions are stagnating.</p>
<p>“Trade Me property data released today shows the average asking price for a property in Auckland in September 2010 was $476,000 – today it is $776,000. Auckland house prices have risen three times faster than household incomes over the same period.</p>
<p>“The data supports what other surveys have confirmed in recent days: contrary to anecdotal reports of the market slowing, the volume of sales and prices went to a new high in the last month.</p>
<p>“While the Waikato and Bay of Plenty have seen house prices rise, prices in the rest of the country are plateauing and even declining in four out of ten regions.</p>
<p>“National spent years denying there was a housing crisis in Auckland. Then when they couldn’t ignore the facts any longer, they took grudging half-measures.</p>
<p>“It is time the Government admitted defeat and embarked on a massive state-backed building programme to flood the market with affordable houses and crackdown on speculators by banning non-resident foreign buyers from purchasing existing homes,” Phil Twyford says.</p>
