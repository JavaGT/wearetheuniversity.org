<p>New graduate school to boost Hutt ICT sector</p>
<p>National List MP based in the Hutt Valley Chris Bishop is applauding the announcement of a new Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Graduate School hosted by the Wellington Institute of Technology (WelTec) along with Victoria University and Whitireia.</p>
<p>“This successful collaborative proposal for an ICT Graduate School will support the Hutt and the wider Wellington region’s connectivity to our burgeoning ICT sector,” says the National List MP.</p>
<p>“ICT is a big part of the Hutt’s future as the home of ‘Technology Valley’. Over 3,900 people across more than 825 Lower Hutt businesses are employed full-time in the high-tech sector, and the sector generates $473 million in GDP already.</p>
<p>“The new ICT Grad School will work with local technology businesses to provide industry focused education. This will equip graduate with the technical skills sought by businesses.</p>
<p>“It will provide a vital link between our fast-moving hi-tech industries and tertiary education providers, providing a pipeline of graduates with the skills and research capacity to ensure Hutt ICT companies thrive.</p>
<p>The Wellington ICT Graduate School will join the Auckland and Christchurch Schools that were announced in July to deliver more of the skilled ICT graduates that New Zealand needs.</p>
<p>“The Government has committed $28.6 million over four years for the development and delivery of three ICT Graduate School, including one based in the Wellington region.</p>

<p>Mr Bishop says the new ICT Grad School is a big boost for the concept of “Technology Valley’ – where science, technology and high value manufacturing drive economic growth, new jobs and higher wages for Hutt residents.</p>
