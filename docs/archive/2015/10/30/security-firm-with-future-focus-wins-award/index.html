<p><strong>Security firm with future focus takes Supreme Business Support Award</strong></p>
<p>A focus on ‘what’s next’ along with strong planning and performance tracking systems earned Advanced Security Group the Supreme Award at the 2015 AUT Excellence in Business Support Awards.<br>Winners were announced at a gala dinner at the Langham Hotel, Auckland on 29 October (see below for a full list of category winners). Advanced Security Group also won the IBM $5M - $20M turnover category award.</p>
<p>“Advanced Security Group has consistently produced an excellent set of financial results over a sustained period, with strong growth in revenue, profits and capital. A detailed business plan identifies key results areas and key performance indicators which are communicated to all staff. The company’s information systems allow them to instantly track performance in both breadth and depth. Advanced Security continues to impress as a company that wishes to extend itself through constant growth and improvement in business support,” said category evaluator and senior lecturer in management at AUT, Dr Roy Smollan.</p>
<p>The AUT Excellence in Business Support Awards celebrate excellence across ten diverse business support sectors ranging from technology and export support to not for profit, government and sales and marketing.</p>
<p>“These Awards are important to AUT because they allow us to recognise the best providers of business support in New Zealand. Business support organisations and individuals make a significant but often unseen contribution to the performance of businesses, helping behind the scenes with everything from dispute resolution, research and legal services to security, compliance and logistics. This celebration of the business support sector is a great opportunity for the AUT Business and Law Schools to join with the business community and celebrate excellence,” said Professor Geoff Perry, Dean of the AUT Faculty of Business and Law.</p>

They are the only national performance measure for New Zealand organisations that provide business support. Applications are judged by evaluators from the AUT Business School with oversight from the New Zealand Business Excellence Foundation.</p>
<p>The 2015 Awards were sponsored by ICG, Fuji Xerox, Drake New Zealand, Idealog, CPA, the Institute of Management New Zealand, IBM and the New Zealand Business Excellence Foundation.</p>
