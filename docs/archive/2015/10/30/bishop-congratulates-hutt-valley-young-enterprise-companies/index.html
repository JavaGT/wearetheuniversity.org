<p><strong>Bishop congratulates Hutt Valley Young Enterprise companies</strong></p>
<p>National List MP based in the Hutt Valley Chris Bishop last night attended the 2015 Young Enterprise Scheme Regional Awards night, where young Hutt Valley entrepreneurs led the way.</p>
<p>“I was very proud to be there last night as Hutt Valley dominated the regional competition. We have some very talented young businessmen and women in the Hutt and tonight proved that beyond doubt,” Mr Bishop says.</p>
<p>“Seven of the thirteen finalist companies were from the Hutt Valley – three from Hutt International Boys’ School, three from Hutt Valley High School, and one from St Oran’s College.</p>
<p>“Hutt companies took two of the top three overall places – with Hydro from HIBS coming third and Liquid Life from Hutt Valley High coming second, narrowly losing to Kiwi Pride from St Mary’s College.</p>
<p>“Hutt companies also took out various category awards. Liquid Life won the ‘Excellence in Innovation’ category, Revamp Boards from St Oran’s College won the ‘Sustainability’ category, and Wellington Now from Hutt Valley High won the ‘Financial Management’ category.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, Moon Dumplings from Hutt Valley High, a team wholly made up of international students won the special award for “Commitment in Business’.”</p>
<p>Mr Bishop and the Hutt Chamber of Commerce jointly sponsored a special prize for the financial management category – with the winners (Wellington Now) receiving free tickets to the 2015 Hutt Chamber Business Excellence Awards dinner.</p>

<p>“At the Wellington Gold Awards earlier this year it struck me that there hardly any young people in the room – and there are few things more important than recognising and encouraging young entrepreneurs. I hope the students from Wellington Now enjoy the black-tie awards evening and hopefully make some useful contacts for the future,” Mr Bishop says.</p>
<p>“Special congratulations are due to two Hutt students in particular – Alana Kirby and Nick Hyland from Hutt Valley High. These students have been selected for the prestigious ‘Venture Up’ boot camp in the holidays next year. Venture Up is an intensive six week boot camp run by Creative HQ and is called ‘Young Enterprise on steroids.’ Only 40 students from around the country are selected so to have two from the Hutt is a significant honour.</p>
<p>“The future of the Hutt is very bright indeed with these fantastic young people doing wonderful things in our city.”</p>
