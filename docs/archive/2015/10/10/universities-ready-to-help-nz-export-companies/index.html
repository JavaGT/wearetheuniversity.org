<p><strong>Saturday, 10 October 2015, 12:03 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Universities_New_Zealand_-_Te_Pokai_Tara">Universities New Zealand - Te Pokai Tara</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Universities ready to help New Zealand’s emerging export companies</strong></p>
<p>Universities want to play a bigger role in helping emerging New Zealand export companies break into international markets.</p>
<p>University Vice-Chancellors and representatives from NZTE and Callaghan Innovation met today to identify and develop opportunities for the university system to contribute to New Zealand’s business growth agenda.</p>
<p>Callaghan Innovation and NZTE currently identify and work with high potential companies to boost their success in international markets.</p>
<p>Chris Whelan, Executive Director of Universities New Zealand, says “Universities are very keen to get alongside these key companies and to help them succeed. The future of New Zealand’s export economy relies upon these companies.”</p>
<p>“Universities have the expertise, research and experience to make a significant contribution to help grow high potential industries and businesses.</p>
<p>Dr Mary Quin, Callaghan Innovation’s CE said, “Callaghan Innovation and Universities are strengthening our areas of collaboration to help New Zealand businesses access the scientific and technology expertise in our Universities.”</p>
<p>Chris Whelan says, “We’ve identified two tangible ways we can contribute.</p>
<p>“One opportunity identified today is to develop better ways to link companies who need skilled staff, with talented students who are looking for internships opportunities to gain industry experience. This would provide a win for all parties.</p>
<p>“The other is to help link individual companies who need research and development expertise, with R&amp;D experts who can help develop solutions and products that will be successful in international markets.</p>

<p>Chris Whelan says universities are already experienced in working with industry and in commercialising innovation.</p>
<p>For example UniServices, a University of Auckland company which commercialises intellectual property and technology, is the largest research and development company of its kind in Australasia, generating well over $100 million per year. UniServices has two international subsidiaries and operates in more than 30 countries.</p>
<p>Another example is the Lincoln Hub, based at Lincoln University. It brings together research, education and industry to accelerate economic development of the land-based sectors and help stimulate private sector innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>“These examples show the importance of universities, government and business working together to make a difference for New Zealand.”</p>
