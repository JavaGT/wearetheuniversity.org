<p>Otago research shows which neurons flip fertility master switch</p>
<p>New Zealand scientists have achieved another milestone in their world-leading efforts to understand the neural mechanisms underlying the brain’s master control of fertility.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Otago Centre for Neuroendocrinology have published the first direct evidence that it is kisspeptin* neurons working in synchrony that generate the small, episodic hormone pulses that are crucial to normal reproductive functioning in humans and other mammals.</p>
<p>The findings are published this week in the prestigious journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).</p>
<p>Professor Allan Herbison, who led the study, says that episodic pulses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to the pituitary gland have long been known to be essential to maintain fertility.</p>
<p>“These episodic pulses—which occur roughly every hour or so—prompt the pituitary to release two key hormones (LH and FSH) into the bloodstream also in a pulsatile manner.</p>
<p>“Many types of infertility result from disorders of pulsatile hormone release ranging from problems at puberty through to the inability to conceive. For example, a very common cause of infertility in women, polycystic ovarian syndrome, is caused when pulses occur too fast,” Professor Herbison says.</p>
<p>He says a key unresolved question has been what the underlying mechanism is that generates the GnRH pulses.</p>
<p>“Is it solely the GnRH neurons generating the pulse, or other activity in the wider network of neurons governing fertility?”</p>

<p>Studying mice, the research team sought to answer this question by using state-of-the-art optogenetic techniques to selectively activate kisspeptin neurons in a particular part of the brain’s hypothalamus.</p>
<p>After measuring blood samples they found that activating this small population of kisspeptin neurons was remarkably potent at generating pulses of LH secretion.</p>
<p>When the researchers activated the kisspeptin neurons in mice lacking kisspeptin receptors on their GnRH neurons, no LH pulses were generated.</p>
<p>“These findings represent an important insight that will inform future efforts to develop new fertility treatments aimed at producing more or fewer GnRH pulses, depending on the problem,” he says.</p>
<p>It is thought that up to one-third of all cases of infertility in women involve disorders in the area of brain circuitry that Professor Herbison and his team are studying.</p>
<p>The research was supported by grants from the Health Research Council of New Zealand and the Royal Society’s Marsden Fund.</p>
