<p><strong>Thursday, 22 October 2015, 11:30 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato">University of Waikato</a></strong></p>
<p>22 October 2015</p>
<p><strong>Satisfaction levels on the rise</strong></p>
<p>University of Waikato students are overwhelmingly satisfied with their study experience.</p>
<p>A student survey conducted by i-graduate asked international and domestic students at more than 200 tertiary institutions to complete a comprehensive survey of their experience.</p>
<p>The survey covered application, arrival, learning, living and support at the institution, along with whether they would recommend it to others and factors involved in their choice of institution.</p>
<p>More than 260,000 students from 20 countries took part. All New Zealand universities took part in the international survey, however only Waikato has offered the survey to domestic students.</p>
<p>For Waikato, 742 international (53%) and 2038 domestic (23%) students took part. The vast majority were undergraduate students, spread across faculties and mainly studying in Hamilton.</p>
<p>Of the international students, most were from China, followed by the UK, India and Malaysia. Overall, they rated their experience at the University of Waikato as second best in New Zealand and 49th globally.</p>
<p>Of the international students, 94% were either satisfied or very satisfied with the University of Waikato, well ahead of the global benchmark of 90%. And more than 80% of both domestic and international students would recommend the university to others, a figure that has steadily increased from 68% in 2008.</p>
<p>Since the last survey was carried out - for domestic students in 2014 and international students in 2013 - satisfaction with many elements has increased. These include accommodation condition on arrival; Fees/finance division; Registration; Welcome; Safety; Host friends; Visa advice and Internet access.</p>

<p>However, other areas – such as halls welfare, financial support and social activities - provide opportunities for improvement.</p>
<p>Assistant Vice-Chancellor of Student and Information Services Michelle Jordan-Tong says the results show steady improvement across the university and those areas identified for improvement were already the focus of further work.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s pleasing to see that where issues were identified in previous surveys and changes in services have been made, satisfaction levels have risen. We will continue to work to provide the best student experience possible.”</p>
<p>The survey will be repeated in 2016.</p>
