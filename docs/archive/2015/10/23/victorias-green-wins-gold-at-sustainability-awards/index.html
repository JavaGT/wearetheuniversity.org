<p><strong>Victoria’s green wins gold at sustainability awards</strong></p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington’s commitment to sustainability and responsible environmental management have been recognised with the University taking out top honours at the prestigious Australasia Green Gown Awards.</p>
<p>Victoria University won the carbon reduction category of the awards, recognising its success in reducing CO2 from buildings and transportation on campus by 12 percent since 2007, in a period when the University has continued to grow. Victoria is the first New Zealand university to win the carbon reduction award, which was accepted by Environmental Manager Andrew Wilks.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Grant Guilford won the leadership category for his ongoing work in a number of areas, including integrating sustainability into the University’s strategic plan, facilitating moves to divest from fossil fuel investments, encouraging government to set more ambitious climate change targets and establishing the role of Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Sustainability).</p>
<p>The Green Gown Awards, which commenced in 2010, recognise excellence in sustainability within the tertiary education sector, and are open to tertiary institutions from Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific. The 2015 award ceremony was held in Geelong, Australia last night, with Victoria one of only two New Zealand universities selected as finalists.</p>
<p>Victoria was also a finalist in the student excellence category, with Victoria University Students’ Association Wellbeing and Sustainability Officer Rory Lenihan-Ikin selected for his work championing campus initiatives such as an organic food co-op, organic waste-collection, a community garden and an energy-saving competition.</p>

<p>Professor Guilford sees Victoria’s representation and success at the awards as acknowledgement of the importance the University places on environmental responsibility in all aspects of its operations.</p>
<p>“I would like to thank all Victoria University staff who through their daily actions right across our teaching, research and campus operations are committed to ensuring a more sustainable future for our community. We are honoured to accept the awards,” says Professor Guilford.</p>
<p>“On behalf of Victoria University of Wellington I would also like to record our appreciation to Australasian Campuses Towards Sustainability for its foresight in establishing the Green Gown awards and for the dedicated work of its membership towards inspiring best practice in sustainability in the tertiary education sector.”</p>
