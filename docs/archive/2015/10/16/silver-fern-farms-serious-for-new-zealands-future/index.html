<p><strong>Friday, 16 October 2015, 3:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong></p>
<p>Member of Parliament for Northland</p>
<p>New Zealand First Leader<br>16 OCTOBER 2015  </p>
<p><strong>Silver Fern Farms Serious for New Zealand’s Future</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First believes the government’s failure to support Silver Fern Farms is a serious matter for New Zealand’s economic future.</p>
<p>“This government is completely hands-off unless you are Rio Tinto, Mediaworks, Warner Brothers or a South Canterbury Finance investor,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“We know Silver Fern Farms tried to meet Finance Minister Bill English in June about its capital options, but Mr English was too busy to even reply.</p>
<p>“The big winners today are the Chinese Government, HSBC, Rabobank and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs pockets a cool $8-$10 million for putting this deal together.</p>
<p>“When farmers reflect they’ll realise what a sour deal this is. They get a one-off bump financially but trade away half-ownership and give the Chinese Government the unified say over the business plan, CEO and the timing and quantity of dividends.</p>
<p>“When National rolls over on Overseas Investment Act approval, it will invite an unprecedented procurement war that’ll break the other big red meat processors.</p>
<p>“Alliance Group’s pig-headedness over proposals to bring the industry together must rank up there with Nero fiddling as Rome burned. The ‘loyalty payments’ it announced last week are like bringing a pop gun to the shootout at the OK Corral.</p>
<p>“And once the deep pockets of Shanghai Maling clear the field, what’s to stop the new buyers loading the company up to the eyeballs in debt?</p>
<p>“It appears nothing has been learned from the recent Brazilian takeover of the Australian meat industry.”</p>
