<p><strong>Otago to return to the fold</strong></p>
<p>15 October 2015</p>
<p>Students at the University of Otago have voted overwhelmingly to stay in the national student movement by a 26-point margin in referendum that closed at 4pm today.</p>
<p>Students were asked whether their local association, OUSA, should ‘withdraw’ membership or ‘retain’ membership of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.</p>
<p>56.22% of students who voted opted to stay, while 29.99% voted to withdraw. 13.79% abstained.</p>
<p>Mr McCourt says the result is impressive in the face of a leading referendum question and explanation notes that were submitted by the outgoing OUSA president who publicly opposed NZUSA.</p>
<p>“I’m glad we can put a year of disruption behind us. The 2016 Executive have said they will vote to re-affiliate at the earliest opportunity. Clearly they have the backing of Otago students to do just that.”</p>
<p>“We have spent a year proving to students that when we work together we can have a clear, considered and articulate voice. I look forward to working with the OUSA team to get important issues like the miserly 7 EFTS cap on the political agenda.”</p>
<p>Kahlia Fryer, the Lincoln University Students’ Association President says she welcomes the decision at Otago.</p>
<p>“It’s important that all student voices are heard on the national stage. Getting a solid recommitment from Otago is good for Otago students, - but actually good for all students too. We are better together.” she says.</p>
<p>McCourt says he hopes OUSA will now re-engage with the national student movement, especially as other associations look to join.</p>

<p>“This result follows an equally impressive vote from Vic students last month, giving NZUSA a strong consolidated membership. Now is the time for us to take an effective and growing student movement to the next level.”</p>
<p>OUSA’s membership of the national body expires on 1 December. NZUSA’s Congress, which elects the president, and sets the budget and strategic direction, will occur in mid-December.</p>
