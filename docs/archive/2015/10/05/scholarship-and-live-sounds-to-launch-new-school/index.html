<p><strong>Scholarship and live sounds to launch new school and music degree</strong></p>
<p>A scholarship to help foster excellence in the New Zealand music scene has been announced by Massey University to coincide with the launch of its new School of Music and its degree in Bachelor of Commercial Music.</p>
<p>Worth $22,500 over three years, the scholarship, in association with the Vodafone New Zealand Music Awards, will help a promising student with tuition fees and other costs over three years of undergraduate study. The degree will be officially launched on Wednesday, (October 7) with the help of local musicians and celebrities.</p>
<p>As part of the newest addition to the Wellington tertiary education scene, Te Rewa O Puanga - the School of Music and Creative Media Production, the new degree is already taking enrolments.</p>
<p>Head of the school, Associate Professor Andre Ktori, says it will take music into the digital world and encourage the new emerging artist – one who is creative as well as strategic in a global music industry.</p>
<p>There are three majors in the degree: music practice, music technology, music industry and the three-year fulltime course is designed to produce creative graduates who are fluent in the production, promotion and distribution of music medias and live events.</p>
<p>Main tutors for the course include Mr Ktori, who is a BAFTA award winner for interactive enhanced music and has been signed to Warner Brothers and Atlantic Records; Warren Maxwell, founding member of Trinity Roots, Little Bushman and ex Fat Freddy’s Drop; Devin Abrams producer and musician from Pacific Heights and international drum and bass act Shapeshifter, and Nicky Harrop who has 18 years’ experience in the music industry working for BMG and Sony Music labels.</p>
