<p><strong>Government’s hunt for oil is a dying dream</strong></p>
<p>Shell’s decision to halt oil exploration off the Otago coast is another blow to the Government’s oil obsession, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>“Shell is joining the likes of Anadarko, Petrobras, and TAG Oil, who have all postponed, cut back, or cancelled their drilling operations in New Zealand waters.</p>
<p>“The Government needs to see the writing on the wall – oil is a sunset industry and we need to be focusing on low-carbon economic prospects.</p>
<p>“We have an incredible opportunity to invest in clean energy and technology, and yet the Government would rather give up our oceans to risky drilling.</p>
<p>“If the world burns all the oil we’ve already discovered, we’re on track for climate catastrophe.</p>
<p>“The National Government is taking a weak emissions reduction target to the Paris climate change conference later this year, and it doesn’t even have a plan to achieve that target. It’s honestly just embarrassing.</p>
<p>“The Government can prove it’s serious on renewables by supporting the Green Party’s Bill to divest government funds from fossil fuel exploration.</p>
<p>“The tide has turned against fossil fuels and the Government needs to stop swimming against it,” said Mr Shaw.</p>
