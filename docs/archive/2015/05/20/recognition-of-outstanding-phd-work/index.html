<p><strong>Recognition of outstanding PhD work</strong></p>
<p>A University of Canterbury (UC) PhD student has been granted an award by the Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC) for his outstanding academic excellence.</p>
<p>Huidong Bai, who is doing a PhD in Computer Science and Software Engineering through the Human Interface Technology Laboratory New Zealand (HIT Lab NZ) and UC’s Department of Computer Science, has been granted the 2014 Chinese Award for Outstanding Self-Financed Students Abroad.</p>
<p>Bai’s PhD research investigates, develops and evaluates Augmented Reality tracking and interaction on mobile and wearable devices.</p>
<p>“The motivation for this research comes from the need for more efficient and accurate tracking methods and more instinctive and reliable interaction approaches for mobile and wearable Augmented Reality systems,” he says.</p>
<p>Bai says he decided to come to New Zealand to study because HIT Lab NZ had a great reputation.</p>
<p>“HIT Lab NZ is one of the world’s best research labs in the Augmented Reality research field and I hoped to work with great researchers here to improve my academic capability.</p>
<p>“The beautiful natural scenery, unique Māori culture and famous outdoor adventure in New Zealand also attracted me a lot.”</p>
<p>Bai says that this award is recognition of his academic achievements.</p>
<p>“Even though I have been studying in New Zealand for almost four years, this award reminds me that the Chinese Government cares about and never forgets its overseas students wherever they are.”</p>

<p>The award was established by the Chinese government in 2003 with the purpose of rewarding the academic excellence of self-financed Chinese students studying overseas.</p>
<p>Only those with outstanding performance in their PhD studies are considered by the award selection panel and no more than 500 people are granted the award each year in 32 countries all over the world. This year three PhD students were granted this award in New Zealand, and Huidong Bai is the only student awarded in UC.</p>
