<p><strong>Monday, 25 May 2015, 12:14 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>A Fee Rise by Any Other Name is Still a Fee Rise Minister</p>
<p>Student fees are going up despite the Tertiary Education Minister’s claims he’s doing students a favour in Budget 2015, says New Zealand First Deputy Leader and Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“Minister Steven Joyce is limiting universities and other tertiary education providers to fee rises of 3 per cent, down from 4 per cent, but this is still a huge cost to students as institutions will raise fees by the maximum amount,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
<p>“Young New Zealanders now start their adult life on the back foot, facing the reality of low wages, high rents and house prices and owing a significant amount of money for their education.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First believes students do have a debt to their country but that it should be repaid in the form of service, similar to the rural service required of teachers, nurses and doctors before the destructive policies around tertiary funding from the 1980s.</p>
<p>“It’s time National gave students a fair go and set them up for a positive future, rather than the current bleak outlook, involving thousands of dollars of debt. The 2015 Budget has given the education sector as a whole little to celebrate. Shake off your cloak of deception Mr Joyce and help our future workforce get off to a less debt-laden start,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
