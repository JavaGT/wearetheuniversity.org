<p><strong>Volunteer expo can open doors to jobs</strong></p>
<p>Volunteering is now seen by many employers as an essential component of an employee’s CV, and Massey University students will get an opportunity on Wednesday to see how they can make a difference at the annual Volunteer Expo.</p>
<p>The Volunteer Expo will be held on both the Auckland and Manawatū campuses on May 13 and offers the chance for students and members of the community to come along and chat with over 20 different not-for-profit organisations to find out the best fit for their skills.</p>
<p>Auckland campus career development consultant Trish Fleetwood says volunteering is becoming more important to employers.</p>
<p>“Employers have told us that one of the factors they look for on a CV is whether or not the potential candidate has volunteered their time and given back to the community. We have found that some of our students start volunteering and discover wonderful ways to add value to the organisations they work with.”</p>
<p>Volunteering also enables people to develop networks, enhance self-esteem and gain insights into a range of career paths.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to host the Volunteer Expo at Massey University and we are looking forward to seeing both students and members of the local community at the expo,” Ms Fleetwood says.</p>
