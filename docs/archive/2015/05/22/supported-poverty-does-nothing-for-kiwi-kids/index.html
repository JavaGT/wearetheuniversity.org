<p>Supported Poverty Does Nothing for Kiwi Kids</p>
<p>Budget 2015 is creating ‘supported poverty’ that will not improve the life of one single child, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“The pittance National is putting into welfare will not get them off the hook from neglecting struggling Kiwis,” says Social Development Spokesperson Darroch Ball.</p>
<p>“While some in social agencies say National has made an important first step to recognising that many are in need we don’t agree.</p>
<p>“Let’s never forget it was National, and the ‘mother of all budgets’ in 1991 that severely cut welfare, and they have taken the axe to it in many ways since.</p>
<p>“National has turned a country of reasonable equality into one of appalling inequality.</p>
<p>“Budget 2015 did nothing to get people off welfare and low incomes and into jobs with fair pay. Where was the job creation?</p>
<p>“Instead National is flooding the country with immigrants – a record in the past year at over 114,000 people. It has extended visas for more and more low-skilled migrant workers, yet there are thousands of New Zealanders out of work, in casual jobs or part-time jobs.</p>
<p>“National has ignored 40 years of research and only reacted when they recognised there might be some political gain.</p>
<p>“But the Budget payment of an average of two dollars a day does not improve the health and education of a single child.</p>
<p>“All National has done is create supported poverty. They are tinkering around the edges in a haphazard approach.</p>
<p>“There is an urgent need for a comprehensive plan that ensures our welfare safety net is real. That translates to a dry safe house and nutritional food.”</p>
