<p><strong>Saturday, 30 May 2015, 12:44 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Nats may have to sell state houses for free</strong></p>
<p>The Government’s social housing policy is totally unravelling as the Iwi Chairs’ Forum says they believe the houses have a market value of zero, meaning the Government will have to give the houses away and lose billions of dollars, says Labour’s Housing spokesperson Phil Twyford.</p>
<p>“Haami Piripi said on The Nation the state house sell-off policy is a lemon but Iwi are willing to step up and take on the houses and tenants. But he said the starting point of negotiations is that the houses have a market value of zero.</p>
<p>“With no one else really in the frame this means the Government is set to give away thousands of state houses and billions of dollars of assets.</p>
<p>“Many of those houses are in Auckland which is a skyrocketing sellers’ market. With houses being sold for double their value it shows how inept Bill English is by selling houses for nothing. If he was a real estate agent he would be fired immediately.</p>
<p>“This is a hole the Government made for itself by charging ahead with a policy that no one really wants.</p>
<p>“If the only way to make Bill English’s pet project work is to give billions of dollars worth of houses away for free then the policy truly is a lemon. No seller in Auckland would put up with such a bad deal from their estate agent. Taxpayers will have the same view,” says Phil Twyford.</p>
