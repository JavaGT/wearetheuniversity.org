<p><strong>Green MPs go without food to highlight climate change</strong></p>
<p>All 14 Green Party MPs are fasting today to highlight the devastating effects of climate change, particularly the threat it poses to our food supply.</p>
<p>Green Party MPs were asked to join Fast for the Climate, a global movement which urges world leaders to work together on solutions to climate change.</p>
<p>Other supporters of Fast for the Climate include: Bill McKibben, founder of 350; Yeb Sano, former Philippines climate negotiator; Rowan Williams, former Archbishop of Canterbury; New Zealanders Phillip Mills, CEO of Les Mills; and former Chief Human Rights Commissioner Rosslyn Noonan.</p>
<p>“We are fasting today to highlight the devastating effects of climate change, and the need for the New Zealand Government to take leadership locally and internationally on this issue,” said Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman.</p>
<p>“The connection between climate change and food was highlighted by the devastating cyclone Pam in Vanuatu, where food crops were wiped out.</p>
<p>“As a food producing and exporting nation, climate change is a threat to our economy.</p>
<p>“New Zealand farmers are on the frontlines of climate change. Out of the various effects of climate change, droughts will have one of the largest and most immediate effects on the New Zealand economy.</p>
<p>“The 2008 and 2013 droughts cost our economy billions. Scientists are clear that droughts will increase in New Zealand due to climate change.</p>
<p>“National must commit to dramatically lowering New Zealand’s emissions and to playing a constructive role at international negotiations to achieve a lasting global agreement.</p>

<p>“National is lagging behind. Many New Zealanders are acting to reduce their carbon footprint, while the Government is projected to increase the nation’s carbon emissions by 50% in the next decade.</p>
<p>“2015 offers a unique opportunity to achieve a global deal to reduce carbon emissions. New Zealand has demonstrated regional leadership in the past on issues like a nuclear free Pacific and we can do it again on climate change.</p>
<p>“National’s commitment to a pollution economy means we are failing to seize the huge opportunities a cleaner, greener future offers our country.”</p>
