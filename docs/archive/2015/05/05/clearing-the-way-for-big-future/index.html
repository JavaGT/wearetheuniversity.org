<p>Clearing the way for big future</p>
<p>It might look ominous to the passing motorist, but the fenced-off construction site at Lincoln University is the next chapter in an exciting range of ongoing developments for both the campus and region.</p>
<p>The Hilgendorf complex of buildings, which have traditionally accounted for approximately 30 per cent of the University’s academic floor space, are being stripped and utilities diverted in preparation for deconstruction.</p>
<p>The work is designed to clear the way for the construction of new teaching and research facilities as part of a campus master plan.</p>
<p>The finer detail of the campus work is yet to be finalised; however, along with state-of-the-art academic facilities, one of the first projects will be a major student centre incorporating a range of student services.</p>
<p>“The announcement by the Government last year for a $107.5 million in-principle commitment to Lincoln’s future development was the green light we needed to push on with these developments,” says Corporate Services Group Manager, Murray Dickson.</p>
<p>“We feel there has been growing awareness in the general public’s understanding, particularly in urban New Zealand, as to the importance, scope and opportunities inherent in the land-based industries and related areas. This is a message we have been pushing for some time now.</p>
<p>“These new developments stand as a ringing endorsement of the role Lincoln has played, and will continue to play, in this key space.”</p>
<p>Significantly, the campus developments will also be tied to the strategic needs of the upcoming Lincoln Hub.</p>

<p>Announced by the Government in April 2013, the Lincoln Hub is a major development project designed as a strategic collaboration between industry, research and education. As well as Lincoln University, Hub partners include DairyNZ, and Crown Research Institutes, AgResearch, Landcare Research, and Plant &amp; Food Research.</p>
<p>It is also expected that the Hub will have significant involvement with wider industry.</p>
<p>The overarching objective of the Lincoln Hub is to transform the productivity and performance of New Zealand’s primary sector and enhance sustainability outcomes.</p>
<p>It is anticipated the Hub will form the most significant concentration of environmental and land-based researchers in the Southern Hemisphere, with around 900 scientists expected to be located on a site that will encompass the land surrounding the Ellesmere Junction Road and Springs Road roundabout at Lincoln.</p>
<p>All of this follows on from the opening in 2014 of the University’s new Food and Function Centre, Te Kete Ika.</p>
<p>“This is a tremendously exciting time for both Lincoln University, the Selwyn region, and New Zealand’s land-based industries,” says Murray Dickson.</p>
