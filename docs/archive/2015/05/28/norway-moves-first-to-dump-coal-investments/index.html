<p>Norway moves first to dump coal investments</p>
<p>The Green Party today called on the Government to secure cross-party support to sell its investments in coal mining companies.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Parliament’s finance committee agreed in a bipartisan motion yesterday to instruct the $1.2 trillion Government Pension Fund to sell its stakes in companies that generate more than 30 percent of their output or revenues from coal-related activities.</p>
<p>“Coal has no future in our economy if we want a future free of runaway climate change,” said Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman.</p>
<p>“The full Norwegian Parliament will instruct one of the world’s largest investors to dump coal, giving a very clear signal on the need to reduce climate risk.</p>
<p>“Our Government can no longer, in good conscience, invest in coal companies that are amongst the biggest individual contributors to climate change.</p>
<p>“Government-run funds like the $27 billion ACC Fund has $138 million invested in the world’s dirtiest coal companies, while the $29 billion New Zealand Superannuation Fund currently has $140 million in coal investments.</p>
<p>“The investment managers of the ACC and Superannuation Funds are hedging that the world will take no action on the climate — but the world is and these investments face a very real risk of becoming stranded and worthless.</p>
<p>“Getting out of fossil fuels is not only the right thing to do, it will make financial sense too.”</p>
<p>The world’s largest pension fund began divesting from coal companies earlier this year citing ‘elevated levels of risk to our investments in the long term’. Norway’s pension fund joins a rapidly growing list of funds, banks, cities, universities, and churches that have divested from coal for ethical and financial reasons since 2011.</p>

<p>“The Green Party has repeatedly called on the Guardians of the Superannuation Fund to begin divesting from the dirtiest, most unsustainable coal companies,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“Money released from divestment can be reinvested in the rapidly growing renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors, helping to hasten the transition of our economy to a safe, low-carbon future.</p>
<p>“This century will be the century of sustainability. The countries and the businesses that lead that shift to sustainability will prosper the greatest,” said Dr Norman.</p>
