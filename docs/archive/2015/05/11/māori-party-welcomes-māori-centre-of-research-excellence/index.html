<p><strong>Māori Party Welcomes Māori Centre of Research Excellence</strong></p>
<p>The Māori Party is pleased that funding for a Māori Centre of Research Excellence (CoRE) for the next five years has been confirmed. Ngā Pae o Te Māramatanga was announced as one of the four new CoRE to receive funding by the Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister, Steven Joyce yesterday.</p>
<p>“The Māori Party secured $20m over 2016 to 2020 in the 2014 Budget to ensure the Government established a dedicated Māori-focused CoRE. It’s satisfying to see this funding allocated,” says Māori Party Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell.</p>
<p>Three groups submitted a bid for the Māori CoRE fund, and Ngā Pae o te Māramatanga based at the University of Auckland was confirmed as the successful applicant.</p>
<p>“A Māori research centre ensures that we have an institution dedicated to reclaiming our traditional knowledge and making research relevant to the development of our communities,” says Mr Flavell.</p>
<p>Ngā Pae o Te Māramatanga undertakes and invests in research concerning mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledges), Māori assets and Māori people.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, Ngā Pae has supported more than 500 Māori PhD graduates to complete research with whānau, hapū, iwi, Māori and indigenous communities here and abroad.</p>
<p>Māori Party Co-leader Marama Fox says, “Ngā Pae has made a huge contribution to Māori and indigenous scholarship in Aotearoa and around the world.”</p>
<p>“I’m proud that the Māori Party has been able to secure the continuation of a Māori Centre of Research Excellence at a time when Māori development is on such a roll,” says Mrs Fox.</p>
