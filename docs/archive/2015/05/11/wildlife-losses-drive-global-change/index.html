<p>Wildlife losses drive global change</p>
<p>Lincoln University senior ecology lecturer Dr James Ross has just returned from Sweden, where he attended a conference aimed at identifying crucial questions for future wildlife research.</p>
<p>The conference was part of a wider project called the Global Challenges University Alliance (GCUA), initiated by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.</p>
<p>Lincoln University has recently joined the GCUA, which involves 25 institutions from each continent coming together to address issues such as food security and climate<br>change.</p>
<p>Participating universities have strong backgrounds in agricultural, environmental or life sciences and a key focus of the alliance is organising thematic workshops and summer school courses for students, so they are provided with an active global network early in their careers.</p>
<p>During the recent conference, which took place between April 26-29, Dr Ross spoke at a workshop called ‘Why Wildlife?’, where scientists shared their thoughts on global challenges relating to wildlife research.</p>
<p>With the alliance aiming to gather greater scientific knowledge about how to cater to a steadily increasing population without causing ecological damage, Dr Ross says wildlife research is an important part of the equation.</p>
<p>“The mass loss of terrestrial animal species, particularly mammals and birds, is considered a major driver of global change,” Dr Ross says.</p>
<p>“Wildlife research has increasingly acknowledged the importance of economic and social dimensions in determining human-wildlife interaction.</p>

<p>“The key question we need to ask ourselves is how do we balance healthy and diverse wildlife populations with social and economic sustainability?</p>
<p>“We also need to clarify what kind of nature we desire, whether that is feasible and figure out how wildlife can contribute to a more sustainable future.”</p>
<p>Although wildlife losses are seen as contributors to global change, many parts of the Northern Hemisphere are now experiencing a strong wildlife comeback, as evidenced by the wolf and lynx across Europe.</p>
<p>“Simultaneously declining and increasing wildlife populations create huge global challenges but also opportunities,” Dr Ross says.</p>
<p>Challenges include larger numbers of wildlife causing conflicts in industries such as agriculture and forestry, and a greater risk of disease transmission between wild and domestic animals and humans.</p>
<p>However, opportunities can arise due to wildlife providing meat from hunting, recreation activities, eco-tourism and positive impacts on biodiversity and disease dynamics.</p>
<p>Dr Ross says wildlife research must find ways of mitigating these conflicts and promoting the opportunities.</p>
<p>The workshop also allowed participants to make plans for summer school courses aimed at PhD students within the GCUA network.</p>
<p>Lincoln University will host the ‘Why Wildlife’ summer school in February next year, with each participating University asked to send two PhD students to take part in the event.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the upcoming summer school will provide students with a global perspective so they will be better positioned to collaborate internationally in terms of addressing important challenges, say project organisers.</p>
<p>Previous GCUA workshop topics have included Aquacultures, The Future of Forests, Green and Sustainable Cities, Environmental Monitoring, The Future of Food and Biofuels and Biorefineries.  </p>
