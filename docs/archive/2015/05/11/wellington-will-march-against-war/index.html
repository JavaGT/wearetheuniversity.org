<p><strong>Wellington will march against war</strong></p>
<p>“On Saturday 16 May, Wellingtonians are invited to march against the commitment of New Zealand troops to the war in Iraq. Peace Action Wellington is organising a family-friendly demonstration starting at Midland Park on Lambton Quay at 2pm,” said Valerie Morse, member of PAW.</p>
<p>“We have organised this demonstration because there is widespread public condemnation of the deployment of troops and the involvement of New Zealand in yet another US war in the Middle East. The creation of ISIS is the direct result of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the flood of weapons and money into Syria via the CIA. Unlike the prime minister, ordinary people in NZ know very well that this latest invasion of Iraq is just a continuation of the war started in 2003.”</p>
<p>“We are sick of the hypocrisy of Western governments and the endless war on terrorism. The US is conducting a constant aerial war across the Middle East with its drone assassination program burning people alive and destroying whole communities. Hundreds of thousands of people have been murdered by the US in Iraq in 10 years of war and occupation. New Zealand is complicit in these war crimes by providing intelligence through the GCSB and now by supporting with troops.”</p>
<p>“The US is sponsoring terrorism and repressive dictatorships across the Middle East while simultaneously undermining genuine democratic movements. New Zealand’s military involvement can do nothing good for the people of the Middle East. The New Zealand Army is not some kind of humanitarian aid agency – it is an organization that uses violence as its first and primary method for solving problems. Instead of standing up for justice in the region, New Zealand is joining up with the thugs and bullies.”</p>
<p>“If the New Zealand government genuinely wants to help people in the Middle East, then it should stop supporting US wars, open the borders to desperate refugees and roll-back racist anti-terrorism laws.”</p>
