<p><strong>AUT University empowering creativity and Kidz First Hospital</strong></p>
<p>Oscar Wilde once said that art is the most intense mode of individualism that the world has known. Some of AUT’s most talented individuals are contributing their artwork to this year’s <em>AUT presents The Original Art Sale</em>, Auckland’s largest art market.</p>
<p>The supermarket-style event includes work from established, emerging and student artists. Prices range from $100 to $5000 to allow people of all budgets to take home a beautiful, original piece of art.</p>
<p>The four-day sale starts with a gala evening on Thursday May 14, where buyers get the first pick of the art on sale, as well as being able to support a great cause with all ticket sale proceeds going to Kidz First Children’s Hospital. Art from four students at New Zealand’s number one ranked Art and Design School will be sold through a silent auction; a new feature at this year’s gala evening.</p>
<p>The pieces being silently auctioned are themed around “what makes a child happy”. For AUT Bachelor of Design graduate Rosie Neyle it was something simple. “So for me it’s the simple things that can make a child happy, so an ice cream on a hot summer’s day is what I have portrayed.”</p>
<p>The Original Art Sale will be held at the Vodafone Events Centre in Manukau and will be open to the public on Friday May 15, 10am to 5pm and Saturday May 16 to Sunday May 17, 10am to 3pm.<br>Entry fee is $15 for adults, $10 for children (up to 16) and $10 for seniors.</p>
