<p>Lincoln bridges accounting gap in schools</p>
<p>Lincoln experts have been bridging a gap in the school syllabus by lending some of their financial know-how to the next generation of Rod Drury’s.</p>
<p>Faculty of Agribusiness and Commerce lecturers were coaching scholarship accounting students at a workshop at Rangi Ruru Girls’ School last month.</p>
<p>Last October Lincoln also hosted students on campus for a workshop on the ‘10-column worksheet’.</p>
<p>Department of Financial and Business Systems Head Dr Tracy-Anne De Silva says given the differences in the syllabus of NCEA Level 3 Accounting and Scholarship Accounting there is a need for teachers and students to be supported through the Scholarship Accounting exam.</p>
<p>“The University is in a good position to provide this support,” she says.</p>
<p>The need was highlighted in discussions the University’s SchoolsLinc Programme Manager Fiona Scott had with teachers.</p>
<p>The workshop focused on the ‘Frameworks’ in accounting, including the NZ Financial Reporting Framework and the NZ Framework. It involved a mixture of lecturing, discussion and working through tasks and scenarios.</p>
<p>The University produced a workbook for the students and the event was useful as professional development for teachers.</p>
<p>“The workshops are a way for schools to become more familiar with Lincoln, including our accounting and finance programme,” Dr De Silva says.</p>
<p>The students will visit the campus later in the year as part of a third scholarship accounting workshop.</p>
<p>Schools involved in the workshop were Rangi Ruru Girls’ School, Christchurch Girls’ High School,<br>Avonside Girls’ High School, Burnside High School, Rangiora High School, Middleton Grange, Christ’s College, St Bede’s College, Christchurch Boys’ High School, Marian College, and Shirley Boys’ High School.</p>

<p>The Faculty of Agribusiness and Commerce was also supporting the Lion Foundation Young Enterprise Scheme (YES) by holding a Marketing Plan workshop on campus this week. The scheme gives students the chance to set up and run their own business for a year.</p>
<p>Students from Villa Maria College, Rangi Ruru Girls’ School, Papanui High School, St Margaret’s College, Hornby High School, Rangiora High School, Christchurch Boys’ High School and St Andrew’s College attended.</p>
