<p><strong>Ilam Press wins top design award for Bulletin</strong></p>
<p>Ilam Press and the Christchurch Art Gallery are celebrating being awarded the top prize for <em>Bulletin</em>, an art gallery magazine at this year’s Museums Australia Multimedia and Publication Design Awards (MAPDA).</p>
<p>Director of the UC School of Fine Arts, Aaron Kreisler, says that the magazine is a smart piece of design.</p>
<p>“It is great to see the team, both lecturers and students, receiving notable accolades for a publication that marries art, teaching and critical discourse.</p>
<p>“We are all very proud of what Ilam Press is creating in the world of publishing, but even more than that what it is contributing as a vital graphic design and unique collaborative studio model, “ says Kreisler.</p>
<p>Ilam Press is a boutique publishing house operating out of the Ilam School of Fine Arts at the University of Canterbury.</p>
<p>Started in 2011 by Fine Arts lecturers Luke Wood and Aaron Beehre, Ilam Press has quickly garnered a significant and even cult following among artists, designers, curators and a wide-ranging readership. As part of this Beehre has been a driving force in bringing <em>Bulletin</em> into Ilam’s studio programme.</p>
<p>Beehre says design students have learnt invaluable skills and innovative approaches to producing this quarterly arts magazine.</p>
<p>“Using unique production processes and an open studio environment, Ilam Press has allowed students to learn first-hand the role publishing can play in both disseminating research and shaping an artistic practice.</p>
<p>“Its connections with artists and institutions such as the Christchurch Art Gallery, has provided industry-leading experience for students graduating into the graphic design industry and arts community,” says Beehre.</p>
<p>Graphic Design students Narelle Denmead, Jose Sanchez, Gemma Banks, Alice Bush, Klaudia Krupa, Sarah Jones and Lisa Maloney have worked on the <em>Bulletin</em> project.</p>
<p>Kreisler says that there are a number of projects Ilam Press are working on that are providing opportunities for top students to work directly on a rich range of printed materials.</p>
<p>“Projects at Ilam Press have seen them liaising with acclaimed artists, designers, curators and institutions in New Zealand and overseas,” says Kreisler.</p>
<p>Kreisler says Ilam Press’ following is largely on the back of these designers and lecturers’ interests in producing and distributing a diverse, yet distinctive range of limited edition artist books.</p>
<p>“This independence of spirit is important because it provided the crucial space for the design/editorial team to make clear decisions, about the types of projects that they have sought to champion and kinds of people they wish to work with,” says Kreisler.</p>
