<p><strong>Government cuts corners on school bus funding</strong>  </p>
<p>The safety of children – not cost cutting – should be the main objective behind the Government’s funding of school buses, Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>“Buried in the detail of this year’s Budget are $19 million of funding cuts for school transport.</p>
<p>“This comes at a time when the safety of school buses is in the spotlight following the horror ride for Green Bay students on Monday afternoon by a relief driver.</p>
<p>“This highlights the need for children to have consistent and specifically trained drivers.</p>
<p>“National’s push to save money through ‘operational efficiencies’ and ‘improving commercial arrangements’ will result in changes to some school bus services and their drivers.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Education says it takes the safety of students using its contracted bus services ‘very seriously’. For that reason all school bus drivers are police-vetted and undergo additional training.</p>
<p>“The Government must assure parents the Ministry’s commitment to safety is not in jeopardy because of its cost cutting.</p>
<p>“No parent wants their children to go through what the traumatised Green Bay students went through on Monday; especially if it is only to save the Government some money,” Chris Hipkins says.</p>
