<p><strong>Seven “best brains” awarded postgraduate scholarships</strong></p>
<p>Several young New Zealanders are heading offshore for their postgraduate study thanks to the William Georgetti Scholarships.</p>
<p>The scholarships were established by the late William Georgetti, a Hawkes Bay farmer, who wanted to create opportunities for the “best brains” to benefit from his bequest. The scholarships encourage postgraduate study and research in a field that is important to New Zealand’s social, cultural or economic development.</p>
<p>The 2015 scholarships were awarded to:</p>
