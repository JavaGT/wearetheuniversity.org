<p>New Zealand Faces Loss of Control of Dairying to Foreign Business</p>
<p>New Zealand faces loss of control of dairying to foreign business, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“Foreigners are gaining control from the grass to the export product,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“Foreign ownership of farms is ticked off on 100 per cent of applications. Foreigners are taking over or building their own processing plants. Foreigners are getting a direct hand up.</p>
<p>“No other country in the world does this. It’s madness.</p>
<p>“For example, in Waikato Hong Kong company He Run International will build a processing plant. This is the third Chinese-owned operation to set up in Waikato in three years.</p>
<p>“In Canterbury Shanghai Pengxin bought 13 Synlait farms. The Synlait Milk processing plant has Chinese-controlled ownership.</p>
<p>“There is advantage for foreigners written into our anti-monopoly laws around Fonterra, which means Fonterra is obligated to supply milk to these plants.</p>
<p>“Another advantage is that foreign companies understand the value of ‘Made in New Zealand’, especially in food production, and will successfully trade on this.</p>
<p>“It was the back-breaking work of Kiwi farmers who broke in the land and built up this tradeable value. Why are we letting foreigners walk in and take over our premium product?”</p>
