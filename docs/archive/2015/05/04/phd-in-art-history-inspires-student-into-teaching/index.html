<p><strong>PhD in Art History inspires student into teaching</strong></p>
<p>Simon McNamara enjoyed his PhD in art history at the University of Auckland so much he’s now studying to be a teacher so he can pass his knowledge on to others.</p>
<p>Simon initially did an MA in English and then a Post Graduate Diploma in Art History.</p>
<p>He graduated with his PhD today. Titled “Concetto in Rembrandt&#39;s Passion Series”, he embarked on a detailed study of Rembrandt’s Passion Series, the name given to five paintings of similar subject, size and format painted between 1633 and 1639 now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich.</p>
<p>A ‘concetto’ is Italian for an idea or concept.</p>
<p>The works were commissioned by Fredrick Hendrick, Stadholder of the United Dutch Provinces and Prince of Orange at The Hague.</p>
<p>“I posited that the concetto for the paintings was based on an Ignatian meditational sequence via a friendship Rembrandt had with Constantijn Huygens secretary to the Stadholder and poet who structured his poetry along Ignatian lines.”</p>
<p>The research was immense. Simon travelled to Europe four times during his PhD so he could study Rembrandt’s works in galleries in Germany, France, Belgium and even St Petersburg.</p>
<p>“There is more literature written about Rembrandt than any other artist. Just getting through the literature was a real challenge.”</p>
<p>During the PhD Simon tutored six art history courses and also lectured in three different papers.</p>
<p>“I really enjoyed it, in fact, I loved it. I really enjoy teaching.”</p>

<p>“You spend such a long time accumulating the knowledge and sharing the knowledge was wonderful.”</p>
<p>It was these teaching experiences that helped Simon decide to enrol in the Graduate Diploma in Secondary Teaching at the University’s Epsom campus.</p>
<p>Tomorrow he’s off to Auckland’s St Cuthbert’s school for a six-week practicum teaching art history.</p>
<p>Simon also had the support of his father, art critic TJ McNamara, during his PhD.</p>
