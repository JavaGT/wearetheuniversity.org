<p><strong>Will the Government’s 2015 budget focus on child poverty?</strong></p>
<p>Workers support the thousands of Kiwis who have already signed a <a href="http://www.actionstation.org.nz/endpovertynz">petition</a> calling on the Government to focus on child poverty in the 2015 Budget which will be released on 21 May.</p>
<p>The ActionStation petition launched yesterday (Sunday 3 May) is a sign of a momentum being built around poverty in this country, CTU Secretary, Sam Huggard comments; “Addressing child poverty requires substantial and concrete commitments from Government to address the underlying causes of poverty,”</p>
<p>“Kids are living in poverty because their whole families are in poverty. We also know that two out of five kids living in poverty are in a household with one parent in work or self-employed and families that are existing on a benefit are certain to be in poverty,”</p>
<p>“Lifting incomes is the way to eliminate poverty. This requires increasing benefit levels, lifting the minimum wage, paying a living wage and promoting collective bargaining which lifts wages,”</p>
<p>“The Governments inaction on eliminating poverty is not just lamentable, it doesn’t make economic sense. $6 billion a year is spent on the consequences of poverty and its’ effects (high health needs, remedial education, justice costs, the list goes on). If the Government spent just $1 billion on addressing the causes of poverty this would have a hugely positive impact on our kids and their families,”</p>
<p>“The Government is responsible to have a better plan of action to look after our future; our kids,” Huggard said. This petition is a powerful message to the Government.</p>
