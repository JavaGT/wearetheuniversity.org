<p><strong>Voice of Reason Calls for Halt to Immigration</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First’s call to stop the immigration avalanche is a voice of reason to reduce the Auckland housing bubble.</p>
<p>“It is not an attack on people coming to live in New Zealand. It is about reducing excessive demand on housing and jobs, and using immigration in a common sense way to benefit New Zealand when the times are right,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“There will always be detractors but the fact is the National Government is allowing runaway immigration, with over a thousand people coming here to live each week, and destroying the home buying dreams of New Zealanders, old and new.</p>
<p>“The excessive demand from immigration numbers, including speculators, should be enough to persuade anyone with a genuine interest in protecting Kiwi interests that it must be stopped.</p>
<p>“”Finance Minister Bill English claims the government is working on the housing crisis. It is not. He’s paralysed while the opportunity to immediately cut demand is ignored - cutting back on immigration, and offshore non-resident home purchases, and applying tax regimes to existing offshore, multi-house owners that many other countries apply.</p>
<p>“New Zealand should not be for sale to the world. We must put Kiwis first and allow them to establish homes and earn a living.</p>
<p>“And the government should stop blowing in the wind while it is doing nothing to reduce demand and little to help supply.”</p>
