<p>Thousands of Students Left in the Lurch with Illogical Rule Changes  </p>
<p>“Badly thought out rule changes by Education Minister Hekia Parata are letting down thousands of teenagers with learning difficulties,” says New Zealand First Deputy Leader Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“Students needing the most help, including those with dyslexia, now won’t quality for assistance such as reader writer aids and extra time in exams,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
<p>“The Minister is allowing the New Zealand Qualifications Authority to strip students of access to Special Assessment Conditions (SAC) if their reading level doesn’t match their age group.</p>
<p>“It will be impossible for many special needs students to attain the vital qualifications they need to move ahead.</p>
<p>“Why is the Minister putting obstacles in front of students instead of helping them to achieve their potential?” asks New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“This is a step backwards and disappointing for all those dedicated to helping this group,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First would work with the sector to urgently review the SAC criteria so all those who need support, including digital solutions, have access to the help they need.</p>
<p>“The Education Minister gets a huge fail mark for this initiative which is yet another setback for students with learning difficulties and their parents.”</p>
