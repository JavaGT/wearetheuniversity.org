<p>University of Canterbury offers assistance with Auckland housing crisis</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury has offered assistance with Auckland’s housing crisis – by offering study opportunities to Auckland students in 2016 and beyond.</p>
<p>“We’re not just being cheeky. It’s fact that some students in Auckland travel 90 minutes or more to tertiary study from flats they can afford. In Canterbury, 90 minutes gets you to a skifield, or a myriad of other recreational opportunities. Those hours of commuting become time for study, recreation and socialising,” University of Canterbury Vice Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says.</p>
<p>“We’ll even help fund it – in 2015 about 40% of new to UC students with NCEA merit or better endorsements received financial awards of up to $3,000. In 2016, new to UC school leavers can get up to $6,000. That goes a long way to meeting the gap between Study Link support and first year accommodation costs in a hall of residence,” Dr Carr says.</p>
<p>“Post-earthquake, UC knows a bit about housing issues. UC relieved post-quake rental pressure by adding student accommodation capacity, and there are plans to add even more to cater for forecast growth. While the pressure is clearly on in Auckland, recent media coverage suggests Christchurch residential rents are dropping to levels last seen two years ago,” Dr Carr says.</p>
<p>“Today, more than 2200 students in UC halls live within 700 metres of their lecture theatres or labs. 60 beds are being added right now, and about 50 beds in halls of residence available tonight.</p>

<p>“All New Zealand universities offer a strong academic programme. What UC offers is that core academic competence, plus opportunities for students to graduate as innovative and enterprising people who are engaged with their community, culturally competent, and globally aware. We offer that because research tells us those are the attributes employers want, and we’re keen to see our students progress well even after they leave UC, rather than just send them off with a qualification.</p>
<p>“There are any number of opportunities for young people in Christchurch to make their mark at the very beginning of their careers, and to continue to do so,” Dr Carr says.</p>
<p>“I firmly believe every New Zealander should spend time in the South Island, and university is a great time to do it. UC offers a vibrant student experience, through partnerships with the Crusaders, the Tactix, the Student Volunteer Army, and UC’s more than 130 student clubs is the most of any New Zealand University. We also have the most field stations of any New Zealand University.</p>
<p>“UC is a world-class research-led University. Despite the earthquakes, we’ve retained our ranking in the top three percent of the world’s 17,000 universities, and UC is ranked the 22nd most international, based on the nationalities of our staff and students.</p>
<p>“Adding to that international flavour, 2015 new to UC students who return to UC in 2016 will be offered an economy return airfare to study for a semester at one of more than 100 partner universities worldwide – a programme that will be offered again in 2016”.</p>
