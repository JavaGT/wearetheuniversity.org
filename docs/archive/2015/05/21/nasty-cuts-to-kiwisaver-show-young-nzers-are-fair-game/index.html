<p><strong>Nasty cuts to Kiwisaver show young New Zealanders are fair game</strong></p>
<p>Government moves to axe the $1000 Kiwisaver kick-start show that the Government has abandoned young New Zealanders, the Green Party says.</p>
<p>“By axing the $1000 Kiwisaver kick-start the Government is denying young New Zealanders the same opportunity to get ahead that other generations have had,” Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said.</p>
<p>“Clearly young New Zealanders are fair game for the National Government. Rather than helping young Kiwis just starting out, it has abandoned them.</p>
<p>“There is nothing in the budget to help young Kiwis who are locked out of the housing market, struggling with student debt, who are trapped in under-employment or whose wages are flat lining.</p>
<p>“Young Kiwis may not have expected to come out ahead after today’s budget, but few of them would have expected to be robbed of the Kiwsaver kick-start other generations got.</p>
<p>“Axing the kick-start payment was a nasty move, designed to save money by taking it from younger Kiwis.</p>
<p>“John Key seems to have forgotten today that unless the economy is working for everyone, it is not working.</p>
<p>“Rather than cutting access to Kiwisaver contributions, the Green Party would have increased access to them, by giving every newborn a $1000 Kids KIiwisaver kickstart.</p>
<p>“We’d match parental contributions up to a maximum of $200 for those who can afford to make them, and provide state contributions to those kids below the poverty line.</p>
<p>“The Green Party’s plan would see young Kiwis reach the age of 18 with nearly $13,000. Under the Government’s new plan those young Kiwis will have nothing,” Mrs Turei said.</p>
