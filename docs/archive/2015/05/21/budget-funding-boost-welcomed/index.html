<p>Media Release</p>
<p>21 May 2015</p>
<p>Budget funding boost welcomed</p>
<p>A 20 per cent increase in tertiary funding for agriculture announced in today’s budget is being welcomed by Lincoln University Deputy Vice-Chancellor International and Business Development Jeremy Baker.</p>
<p>The increase is part of an $85.8 million boost over four years for targeted increases in tuition rates at degree level and above, which also includes a 7.5 per cent increase for science.</p>
<p>Mr Baker described the announcement as recognition of the vital role agriculture plays in the New Zealand economy, and for institutions like Lincoln University, with its specific land-based focus, in providing world-class graduates to meet the growing demand in the sector for highly-trained workers.</p>
<p>It shows the area is a priority for the Government and for New Zealand, he says, as it needs to be.</p>
<p>He also praises the extra funding for science as it is complementary with agricultural studies in many of the programmes being offered at the University.</p>
<p>“The extra funding will allow for extra investment in the scientific intensity of the programmes, and will help attract students to agriculture, a subject area which is already experiencing significant growth,” he says.</p>
