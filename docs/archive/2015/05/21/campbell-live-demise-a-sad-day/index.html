<p><strong>Campbell Live demise ‘a sad day’</strong></p>
<p>Journalism commentator and educator, Associate Professor Jim Tully, says MediaWorks&#39; changes to TV3’s current affairs slot at 7pm suggests New Zealand’s two main networks have opted out of providing serious prime time current affairs.</p>
<p>Mr Tully, who is Researcher in Residence at Massey’s University’s School of Communication, Journalism and Marketing, called the demise of Campbell Live &quot; a sad day for those who value an intelligent discussion of news and current affairs at Peak Time.&quot;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the programme was a casualty of the commercial realities of a television network, he says.</p>
<p>&quot;The ratings had to be consistently higher for Campbell Live to be sustainable. MediaWorks clearly wants a format which produces a bigger audience as a lead into its peak time programmes which are clearly going to be reality shows.”</p>
<p>Mr Tully, who is also an Adjunct Associate Professor at Canterbury University, says at least one outlet remained on weeknight television for viewers to gain informed insight into the issues behind the daily news.</p>
<p>&quot;Thankfully, Native Affairs on Maori Television will continue to offer serious current affairs but it is extremely disappointing that the two national networks - TVNZ and TV3 - have opted out.”</p>
