<p>Student voice extravaganza kicks off in capital</p>
<p>12 May 2015</p>
<p>The national student union NZUSA is this week hosting a series of conferences on issues in the tertiary education sector with students and staff from universities, institutes of technology and polytechnics (ITPs).</p>
<p>The first conference, which begins today, focuses on student voices in ITPs and includes a guest speaker from the Student Participation in Quality Scotland (sparqs). Hannah Clarke, who works as a Development Advisor for the leading Scottish quality improvement agency, will speak on international best practice.</p>
<p>Other workshops in the first conference will include ‘Using Student Voice to Extend Co-Curricular Activities and Reinvigorate Campus Life’ and ‘Using Student Voice to Enhance Learning’.</p>
<p>On Thursday 14 May NZUSA is hosting a one-day National Workshop on the Compulsory Student Services Fee (CSSF), the universal charge that universities and polytechnics use to fund services like health, counselling and support for students’ associations.</p>
<p>NZUSA Executive Director Dr Alistair Shaw said calls from across the sector to better understand the obligations of institutions and student organisations with respect to CSSF led the student union to organising the national workshop in conjunction with the Tertiary Education team at the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>“This is in the context of a comprehensive review of the CSSF scheduled to be completed in 2015. There are some pockets of great practice but also a lot of confusion regarding the reporting and consultative obligations on institutions, we seek to resolve the confusion and spread the good practice.&quot; says Dr Shaw.</p>

<p>The CSSF workshop will be followed by a final one-day conference on student voices in universities. Featuring the Academic Quality Agency, Ako Aotearoa and once more sparqs, the conference will focus on good practice already underway in the sector in New Zealand and abroad.</p>
<p>Dr Shaw says “Empowering and enabling student voice has been an increasing focus both for NZUSA and for local associations, and we are delighted that both regional and metro-based polytechnics and universities are joining us to explore what is currently good practice and seek to make that current best practice becomes the normal of the future.”</p>
<p>“We are also delighted that the Ministry of Education, NZQA, Ako Aotearoa and the Academic Quality Agency have partnered with us in looking to make the voice of students central to the mission of enhancing quality across the sector” says Dr Shaw.</p>
<p>Rory McCourt, the National President of NZUSA, says the conferences demonstrate the need for a national student body focused on the things that will make universities and polytechnics better for students.</p>
<p>“The evidence shows that giving students a say on their education increases the quality of that education. We’re proud to bring together the sector to explore how best to do that, because it can only be good for students. These conferences further prove the value NZUSA brings to education delivery in New Zealand.”</p>
<p>“I want to thank our partners whose foresight and hard work have made this week possible. I’m really looking forward to it!” says McCourt.</p>
