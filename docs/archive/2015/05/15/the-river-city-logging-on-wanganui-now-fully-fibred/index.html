<p>The River City logging on – Wanganui now fully-fibred</p>
<p>The local build of the Government’s Ultra-Fast Broadband network is now complete in Wanganui. Local MP Hon Chester Borrows was with Communications Minister Hon Amy Adams for the announcement at the Beyond Broadband Expo.</p>
<p>“Wanganui is now fully-fibred. Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) is now available to over 17,000 homes, schools, businesses and health facilities here in our city,” Mr Borrows said.</p>
<p>“The local council’s been very supportive in promoting the installation and uptake of the network here in Wanganui, and I’d like to thank them for that.”<br>“UFB will help promote innovation, create jobs, and grow our local economy – who wouldn’t want that?</p>
<p>“Before National was re-elected, we told the country we were going to build a world-class broadband network. Wanganui’s is now up and running, and I’m look forward to seeing the benefits this quick, reliable internet brings to our communities,” Mr Borrows said.</p>
<p>The Wanganui network build, completed by local network company Ultra-Fast Fibre, is the result of a $23 million investment by the Government, in partnership with Waikato Networks Limited.</p>
<p>For the past three years, Wanganui’s been named as one of the world’s “Smart 21” cities by the Intelligent Communities Forum – a global organisation which recognises potential for communities to prosper in the broadband economy.  </p>
