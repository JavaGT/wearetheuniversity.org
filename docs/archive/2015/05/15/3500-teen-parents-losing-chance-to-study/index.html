<p>3500 Teen Parents Losing Chance to Study</p>
<p>Three and a half thousand teenagers are missing out on schooling in teen parent units, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“The government is not funding enough places, forcing communities to make up some of the shortfall,” says New Zealand First Deputy Leader and Spokesperson for Education Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“But communities face impossible processes to get the units off the ground.</p>
<p>“We applaud Northland College and its community for its perseverance and hard work in setting up a new teen parenting unit in Kaikohe,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
<p>The Association of Teen Parent Educators NZ says there are only 500 student places, yet there are 4000 teen parents.</p>
<p>New Zealand First Spokesperson for Youth Affairs Darroch Ball says there is also a need for support for teenaged fathers.</p>
<p>“Both parents cannot attend the units or take part in budget or parenting classes because of restrictions on enrolments.</p>
<p>“An unintended consequence of the recent benefit changes is that young parents who choose to stay together have their financial support stripped down.</p>
<p>“This could ultimately undermine the long-term stability of these young families and can negatively influence the choices they make. More focus is needed on support, guidance and opportunities for young fathers,” says Mr Ball.</p>
<p>“Supporting all young parents as they adjust to one of the most important roles they will hold in their lifetime is just common sense,” says Mr Ball.</p>
