<p><strong>Ngaro&#39;s News: May 2015</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to my May Newsletter. It has been quite a busy month in the community.</p>
<p>Cyclone Pam relief efforts for Vanuatu and Tuvalu saw West Aucklanders and others open their cupboards and their hearts to provide food, clothing and other neccessities for the cause. Well done, West Auckland!</p>
<p>I popped into the launch of John Turner’s <em>Te Atatū me: Photographs of an urban New Zealandvillage</em> book at the Te Atatū library. I also joined the JP West Auckland Justice of the Peace Support Group in paying tribute to Mr Assid Corban – one of West Auckland’s well-known residents and stalwarts of the community – at the special presentation of a JP Retired award to Mr Corban. This was a well-deserved award to a former Mayor of Henderson and Waitakere.</p>
<p>National’s Kiwisaver Homestart roadshow also kicked off at Henderson Baptist church with Minister of Housing, Hon Dr Nick Smith. More than a hundred people turned up to listen, ask questions, and many were eager to sign up for the scheme. <a href="https://www.national.org.nz/aa88ee3c-d13d-4751-ba3f-7538ecc6b2ca?sf=2342F4EA4D9Fhttps%3a%2f%2fwww.national.org.nz%2fpolicies%2fhomestart">For more information, click here</a>.</p>
<p>I went along to the opening of Tasman Care Home Henderson, a 72 bed care and hospital facility run by BUPA. It’s a modern complex that’s well-equipped for the care of our elders.</p>
<p>The 100th anniversary of the ANZACs’ first landing at Gallipolli led to a range of commemoration activities across the country last month. Building up to ANZAC day, I was proud to attend Art Exhibitions at Devonport, and Māngere that featured the works of Cook Islands artists, and commemoration events in Wellington, Waihi and Auckland. Also, it was a pleasure to see the_Capturing the ANZAC tales_ show at Massey High School by Stephen Dallows (Applied Theatres Consultants) and his talented students. The show was a unique collaboration with residents of Waitakere Gardens, whose stories the students portrayed.</p>

<p>On ANZAC day, along with more than 30,000 people, I was honoured to attend the dawn service at the Auckland domain. I later attended the commemoration services at the Te Atatū RSA, and the Henderson RSA parade and service. In the afternoon I attended the Cook Islands World War 1 Commemoration at Māngere and watched the Tamatoa play in the evening. It sure was a full day of ANZAC events, but it allowed the opportunity to give due recognition and acknowledgement to our fallen and current solidiers.</p>
