<p>Lincoln scholars intent on educating young minds  </p>
<p>A group of first-year Lincoln University students have ended their semester by coming up with ideas on how to educate Kiwi high school pupils about pressing world issues.</p>
<p>The 58 students are Lincoln’s first Global Challenges Scholars, acting as ambassadors for a new nationwide programme that aims to address concerns such as climate change and resource depletion, as well as provide teaching resources to secondary schools.</p>
<p>“The students worked on an end-of-semester project after being divided into nine groups, based on issues they were interested in,” says SchoolsLinc Programme Manager Fiona Scott, who supervises the scholars’ Global Challenges activities.</p>
<p>“We asked them to produce a factual, informative three-minute video about a specific global challenge, without including bias or opinion. Then they had to find differing perspectives on the issue and present their findings to the rest of the scholars.”</p>
<p>The groups discussed issues including rising sea levels, obesity, climate change, food wastage, overpopulation, deforestation and water quality, taking into account different ideas on the subjects.</p>
<p>For example, the group that researched obesity presented views from such varied sources as a Lincoln University Research Associate Professor, a Reproductive Health Centre Director in the US, the Ministry of Social Development, and the Ministry of Health. They also mentioned cultural and positive perspectives on obesity.</p>

<p>“The students found that the Research Associate Professor sees genes as playing a significant role in obesity, reproductive health studies point to a link between obesity in pregnancy and obese children, the Ministry of Social</p>
<p>Development cites low parental income as a cause of childhood obesity, and people in some poorer countries view excess weight as a sign of good health and prosperity,” says Ms Scott.</p>
<p>“The students also discussed positive aspects to obesity, including faster healing times, less chance of injury in elderly people and more jobs in dietary, personal training and healthcare industries.”</p>
<p>Ms Scott says the group would like to see their resources used in Year 9 and 10 Physical Education classes to bring awareness to the issue and also suggested showing presentations to school pupils during a health week.</p>
<p>“As far as all the students’ presentations are concerned, we want school teachers to initially play the videos to their classes,” Ms Scott says.</p>
<p>The scholars will also suggest that teachers allocate each of the different perspectives to a pupil, who can carry out further research, investigating why the person or organisation holds their particular opinion.</p>
<p>Pupils could then present their findings to the class.</p>
<p>“Classes might also want to look more closely at the sources of information the scholars used to find the perspectives,” says Ms Scott.</p>
<p>“This can be investigated from a bias or accuracy point-of-view, to teach younger students about the reliability and usefulness of evidence.”</p>
