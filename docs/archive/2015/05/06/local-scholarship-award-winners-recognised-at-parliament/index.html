<p><strong>Local scholarship award winners recognised at Parliament</strong></p>
<p>The 2014 New Zealand Scholarship Awards have just been presented and Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga was excited to be there as top students were recognised and celebrated for their achievements.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled to see students Jonathan Hart and Rahul Sod from Auckland Grammar School gain the honour of being named two of only 10 Premier Scholars with honours in a number of subject areas between them,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
<p>“This is out of almost 8000 students who participated in New Zealand Scholarship exams last year.</p>
<p>“As an Auckland Grammar Old Boy I was particularly proud to see these boys honoured for their outstanding academic achievements. All the award winners should feel extremely proud of what they have achieved. A scholarship is wonderful recognition of hard work.</p>
<p>“These scholarships will provide financial support to students over the next three years to continue studying at a higher level. It means there will be no financial barrier which could stop these talented students from going on to achieve even more success.</p>
<p>“I believe education is the best base for success in the working world and I am glad to be here among so many students who already recognise the value of their education and who are working hard for it.</p>
<p>“National believes ensuring every child gets a good education is one of the most important things we can do to raise living standards, and build a more competitive and productive economy,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.</p>
