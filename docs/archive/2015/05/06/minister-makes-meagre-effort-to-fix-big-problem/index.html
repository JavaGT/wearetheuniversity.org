<p><strong>Wednesday, 6 May 2015, 5:23 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Minister makes meagre effort to fix big problem</strong></p>
<p>Today’s announcement by Health Minister Jonathan Coleman that Budget 2015 will include $98 million for elective surgery over three to four years should be seen for what it is – a drop in the bucket in an effort to appease thousands of concerned New Zealanders, Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“This will be greeted by the sector with an awful sense of déjà vu. It is a re-announcement with a little gift wrapping.</p>
<p>“The Minister’s predecessor Tony Ryall, using exactly the same words as Mr Coleman – ‘elective surgery makes a real difference to patients and their families’ – announced $48 million of this funding in last year’s budget.</p>
<p>“Jonathan Coleman has been under attack from all sides about the increasing numbers of Kiwis being rejected for a first consultation with a specialist or being kept out of operating theatres because they don’t meet pain thresholds.</p>
<p>“At the same time he has repeatedly denied there’s a problem.</p>
<p>“Now he thinks he’s fixing it with $50 million over three years. Do the maths – that’s on average $833,000 per year for each of the 20 district health boards.</p>
<p>“We welcome any moves to help in this area, but to steal a line from members of Hastings Grey Power: more honesty and fewer weasel words please Mr Coleman.”</p>
