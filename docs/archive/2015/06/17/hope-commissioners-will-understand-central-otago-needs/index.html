<p>Dean – Hope commissioners will understand Central Otago health needs</p>
<p>Waitaki MP Jacqui Dean said she was hopeful the appointment of commissioners to replace the Southern District Health Board would signal a new way of thinking for rural health in Central Otago.</p>
<p>“I hope the commissioners will understand the needs of Central Otago’s growing population and be ready to utilise the modern technologies that are on offer to ensure better rural health delivery.</p>
<p>“The health budget is growing year on year but is always limited, and the funding needs to be spent wisely. I’m hopeful that the appointment of these commissioners will signal a new approach to the way that our health dollars are spent in rural areas.</p>
<p>“I’d like to see some new thinking and the use of some new models in health service delivery.</p>
<p>“For example, let’s investigate whether the services local people travel to Dunedin to access couldn’t be effectively delivered at Dunstan for the same costs.</p>
<p>“In the future funding may need to be targeted at appropriately meeting the needs of the growing number of patients in Central Otago by delivering services closer to home.</p>
<p>“The visiting surgical bus is a unique way of delivering low risk elective day surgery services to patients in rural areas, without the need for accommodation, or long distance travel.</p>
<p>“Using this product could be the way of the future for Central Otago and I hope that the new commissioners will positively consider it.</p>

<p>“I would like to see them, the community and rural health professionals working together in a progressive and open minded way to deliver improved health services to the people of Central Otago.”</p>
<p>Mrs Dean said she had responded to hundreds of letters from the community about this issue and she believed the Health Minister’s latest decision would go a long way towards addressing those concerns.</p>
