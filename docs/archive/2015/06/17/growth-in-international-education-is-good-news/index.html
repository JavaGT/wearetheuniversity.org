<p><strong>Growth in International education is good news for Palmerston North</strong></p>
<p>Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce recently announced that the number of international students enrolled to study in New Zealand grew 13 per cent last year.</p>
<p>Full time enrolment figures for 2014 shows 110,198 international studies studied in New Zealand, 13,091 more than in 2013. Palmerston North had 3,186 enrolled international students in 2014.</p>
<p>“This is great for Palmerston North” says Jono Naylor.</p>
<p>“Palmerston North is a world class education city and international students play an important role in connecting us to the world,” says Naylor.</p>
<p>“As a city, we need to capitalise on this increase.</p>
<p>“We should continue to promote ourselves as a great place to come and study.</p>
<p>“International education is a very competitive market and Palmerston North needs to ensure it promotes itself in the fields we excel in such as Food Technology and the Sciences.</p>
<p>“We should be celebrating the fact that many international students choose Palmerston North as a place to come and live and learn.</p>
<p>“International students add to our city’s vibrancy and culture,” says Naylor.</p>
