<p><strong>Tuesday, 16 June 2015, 7:52 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Prime Minister misled or badly briefed</strong></p>
<p>The Prime Minister has either been deliberately misleading about the Auckland land dispute or he was not properly advised by Housing Minister Nick Smith, Opposition Leader Andrew Little says.</p>
<p>“John Key said yesterday Ngati Whatua has no right of first refusal and there is no land parcel that can be used as the basis of a legal case to test this provision.</p>
<p>“But now it has been revealed that one of the four land parcels touted by Nick Smith – at Moire Road in Massey – was notified by the Government several months under a limited partnership which includes Ngati Whātua.</p>
<p>“It beggars belief that Nick Smith didn&#39;t know the site had been notified under Right of First Refusal provisions when he was showing it off to journalists and Australian property developers.</p>
<p>“The Government&#39;s Budget centrepiece housing policy has become a farce. The Prime Minister said yesterday the four sites Nick Smith showed off to journalists were just &#39;conceptual&#39; and not actually for sale.</p>
<p>“This follows news last week that another of the four sites – beside the motorway at Manukau City – is not even owned by the Government.</p>
<p>“With Auckland house prices up $115,000 in the past year and the shortage of housing worsening by the day, Generation Rent deserves more than the half-baked last-minute fiascos that pass for housing policy under this Government,” Andrew Little says.</p>
