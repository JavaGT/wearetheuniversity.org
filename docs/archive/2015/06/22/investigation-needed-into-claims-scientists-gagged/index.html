<p><strong>Monday, 22 June 2015, 11:21 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>David Cunliffe</strong><br>Science and Innovation Spokesperson</p>
<p><strong>Independent investigation needed into claims scientists gagged</strong></p>
<p>Steven Joyce must launch an independent investigation into claims that scientists are being gagged, says Labour’s Science and Innovation spokesperson David Cunliffe.</p>
<p>“When 40 percent of scientists say they are being gagged and can’t speak out on issues of public importance, it’s clear evidence something is wrong.</p>
<p>“It’s not good enough for the Minister just to shrug his shoulders, look the other way, and say he doesn’t know if there is really a problem.</p>
<p>“He should immediately launch an independent investigation into what is happening at our universities and CRIs to ensure there is no inappropriate pressure being placed on scientists to stifle public debate.</p>
<p>“New Zealand spends less than half the OECD average on research and innovation. That leaves scientists increasingly reliant on the private sector for funding.</p>
<p>“The Minister has a responsibility to ensure that scientists can contribute to public debate in New Zealand without fair of reprisal.</p>
<p>&quot;Science is a public good. It is an essential part of building a high income, sustainable future economy and society.</p>
<p>“When scientists feel gagged it threatens the public good. New Zealand needs free and open inquiry and debate,” says David Cunliffe.</p>
