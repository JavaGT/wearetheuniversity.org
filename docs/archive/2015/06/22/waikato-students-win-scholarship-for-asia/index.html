<p>Waikato students win scholarship for Asia</p>
<p>A University of Waikato student from Morrinsville is heading to one of the largest cities in Asia after being awarded a 2015 Prime Minister’s Scholarship for Asia.</p>
<p>Ella Gollogly is going to Seoul, South Korea where she will spend 17 weeks studying papers in data, communications and marketing at Yonsie University. The papers will be cross-credited to her Waikato degree.</p>
<p>Ella and three fellow Waikato students, Jonathan Adams, Sam Gilling and Christopher Batterton, are among 60 students nationwide to be awarded the scholarship.</p>
<p>While Ella has her sights set on Seoul, Jonathan’s off to Kansai Gaidai University in Osaka Japan, Christopher is going to study in Singapore and Sam is already undertaking a six-week internship with a non-government agency in India, helping educate children with disabilities.</p>
<p>Ella says she had been aiming for the scholarship for years.</p>
<p>“I first heard about the scholarship in 2013 before I was at university and as soon as I was eligible I went for it,” says Ella.</p>
<p>It was a long application process but with the help of Gwenda Pennington at the university’s Scholarships Office and other staff, Ella managed to submit a successful application.</p>
<p>It will be her second trip to South Korea, a country she’s fallen in love with. She has been teaching herself Korean to help overcome the language barrier.</p>
<p>“South Korea has a really interesting blend of culture, history and modern technology,” she says.</p>
<p>“As a Bachelor of Electronic Commerce student the high-tech side of things really appeals to me.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister&#39;s Scholarships for Asia is a scholarship programme funded by the New Zealand government and administered by Education New Zealand. Established in June 2013, the scholarship covers costs relating to study or research in Asia.</p>
