<p>“There is a strong emphasis on wellbeing and indigenous approaches, which aligns to a kaupapa Māori way of being.”</p>
<p>The conference title and theme, He Manawa Whenua, is the Māori term for a subterranean aquifer or an underground spring. It is from this source that the most pure, clear and refreshing water is obtained, being naturally filtered through the land before emerging at the surface. Water is life, and because a Manawa Whenua originates deep within the earth, Māori believe it is a most precious resource, vital for the well-being of the people.  The statement “he manawa whenua e kore e mimiti”, considers that the flow of the underground spring is everlasting, therefore its benefits are unlimited.</p>
<p>This conference views mātauranga Māori as a Manawa Whenua, or a pool of knowledge, that is situated within the heart of the people. Like the water, this knowledge has been filtered throughout time by the community as well as the environment to become central to the life and well-being of Māori.  This Māori centred knowledge also has the potential to deliver unlimited benefits for Māori, both now and into the future.</p>
