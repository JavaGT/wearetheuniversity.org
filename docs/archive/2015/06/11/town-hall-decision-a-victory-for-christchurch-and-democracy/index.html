<p><strong>Town Hall decision a victory for Christchurch and democracy</strong></p>
<p>The decision to restore Christchurch’s Town Hall is a victory for the people of Christchurch and a validation of their democratic rights, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>“Since the earthquakes, Cantabrians have become all too used to Government-appointed bureaucrats making decisions without any real mandate, and without hearing the public’s concerns or heeding their wishes,” said Green Party Christchurch issues spokesperson Eugenie Sage.</p>
<p>“By voting to restore the Town Hall, rather than bowl it, the Council has listened to the wishes of the people and made the right decision for Christchurch.</p>
<p>“There will be a lot of people walking around Christchurch with smiles on their faces today.</p>
<p>“Restoring the Town Hall has always been the best option – economically, culturally and for rebuilding a sense of civic pride.</p>
<p>“This building is a Christchurch icon and, with restoration, will once again be known as one of the top concert venues in the world.</p>
<p>“This is a great example of elected councillors making critical decisions based on the wishes of their constituents.</p>
<p>“There’s a lesson here for Gerry Brownlee, CERA, and the Government.</p>
<p>“They should all take note of how democratic decisions should be made – by the councillors elected by Christchurch residents, and not by those who spend most of their time in Wellington.</p>
<p>“This is a great day for Christchurch and the wider Canterbury region,” said Ms Sage.</p>
