<p>Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor Resigns</p>
<p>Dr Andrew West today resigned as Vice-Chancellor of Lincoln University.</p>
<p>“I am proud of what the University has achieved under my leadership. It has been a fabulous three years and Lincoln is on track to become one of the world’s truly great land-based universities”, said Dr West.</p>
<p>“However my commitment of time, energy and focus has been so great that it is now appropriate that I refocus on my family that live in the Waikato and on my very elderly parents that live in England”, Dr West added.</p>
<p>“I want to wish the University every future success. It is a fabulous place to study and I’d encourage any young New Zealanders interested in careers in the country’s most important industry to enrol there”, said Dr West.</p>
<p>The University’s Chancellor, Tom Lambie, acknowledged Dr West’s significant contribution.</p>
<p>“In the past three years under Dr West the University has focused on its land-based specialisation through qualification reforms, revitalisation of capability, in-principle investment of $100m by Government in Lincoln, and growth in student enrolments”, said Mr Lambie.</p>
<p>“The University wishes Dr West well in his ongoing career in global agri-business and looks forward to continuing collaboration with Dr West in the future”, added Mr Lambie.</p>
