She also holds a Ministerial appointment on Te Ture Whenua Māori (Māori land law) reform and has previously been appointed to Ministerial advisory groups on Resource Management Act, constitutional issues and foreshore and seabed.</p>

<p>Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the College of Arts, Professor Jonathan le Cocq says: “I am delighted with the wealth of skills and experience that Sacha will bring not only to Aotahi - our School of Māori and Indigenous Studies - but also to the management and delivery of arts at UC as a member of our management team. I am especially pleased that, in her appointment, we will continue to develop the links between ourselves and Ngāi Tahu established by our previous, highly respected, Head of School, Lynne Harata Te Aika.”</p>
<p>Assistant Vice-Chancellor Māori, Darryn Russell, says Sacha’s appointment is a wonderful addition to the University and he “looks forward to the contribution and development in the future space that Sacha will bring to Te Aotahi, the College of Arts and the wider University.”<br>ends</p>
