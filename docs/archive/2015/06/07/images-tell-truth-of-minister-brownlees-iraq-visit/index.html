<p><strong>Images Tell Truth of Minister Brownlee’s Iraq Visit</strong></p>
<p>Minister of Defence Gerry Brownlee’s visit to the Taji military base and an interview on TV One’s <em>Q+A</em> has inadvertently revealed the parlous state of security within the Iraqi base, let alone outside it, says New Zealand First Defence Spokesperson Ron Mark.</p>
<p>“It is a sad reflection of the truth, that within the wire, Minister Brownlee’s visit was top secret and while he met handpicked Iraqi troops, it was in body armour and closely escorted by New Zealand troops and special forces,” says Mr Mark.</p>
<p>“These pictures tell a thousand words and if that is the security state inside Taji, then it must be bandit country outside the wire because sadly it is.</p>
<p>“Of course Minister Brownlee met handpicked Iraqi troops extolling their trust in the Iraqi government. We’ve heard that bravado before, most prominently from Saddam Hussein’s infamous Iraqi Information Minister who became known as ‘Comical Ali’.</p>
<p>_“_Security <em>is</em> no laughing matter because Taji is within striking distance of Fallujah and Ramadi under ISIS control. The front is porous and not helped by <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/06/04/isis-shows-off-us-gear-seized-from-iraqis-in-fighting-near-fallujah/">ISIS brazenly bragging about the Iraqi government equipment and uniforms it has seized</a>.</p>
<p>“My intelligence sources reveal the extent of ISIS led bombings, IED and intimidation in provinces around Taji. This is a monumental mess and Mr Brownlee’s fleeting top secret visit does nothing but reinforce the dangers that exist within the wire,” says Mr Mark.</p>
