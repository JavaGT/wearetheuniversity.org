<p>Stand-alone health agency needed for Corrections</p>
<p>The Green Party is calling for a stand-alone agency to monitor and provide for prisoners’ health needs.</p>
<p>The call for a stand-alone agency comes after a Coroner’s report into the death of a remand prisoner, Jai Davis, at a South Otago jail in 2011. The Coroner expressed concern that the health of the prisoner was not the main priority of Corrections.</p>
<p>“When there is a concern regarding a prisoner’s health it is vital that this is dealt with in a humane manner by independent health professionals,” Green Party Corrections spokesperson David Clendon said today.</p>
<p>“The need to maintain security within Corrections facilities can and should be achieved in a way that does not compromise providing safe and humane care for prisoners.</p>
<p>“The primary concern of those dealing with prisoners’ health should be looking after their health needs rather than security.</p>
<p>“Currently those dealing with prisoners’ health are employed by Corrections, and all too often the situation arises whereby security concerns are trumping health concerns.</p>
<p>“It is vital there is some form of separation.</p>
<p>“Health professionals employed via a stand-alone agency will be able to make prisoners’ health their main priority.</p>
<p>“Until a stand-alone agency employs health professionals to work in Corrections there will be a risk of further tragedies.</p>
<p>“The Coroner’s report into the Jai Davis tragedy shows that the basic standards of the Corrections Act are not being met.</p>
<p>“A failure to meet even the minimum standards required by law puts at risk New Zealand’s status as a country where human rights are respected,” Mr Clendon said.</p>
