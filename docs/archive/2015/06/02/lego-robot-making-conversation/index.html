<p><strong>LEGO robot making conversation</strong></p>

<p>Having a conversation with a talking LEGO robot has been made possible thanks to a collaborative project between UC’s Human Interface Technology Laboratory New Zealand (HIT Lab NZ) and Japan’s Osaka University.</p>
<p>Masters student Shogo Nishiguchi, from Osaka University, has been working with HIT Lab NZ and has created The Robot Engine (TRE).</p>
<p>Nishiguchi says the result is a new approach to animating robots and programming their interaction with users.</p>
<p>“Enabling experts on human behaviour to design fluent animations and behaviours for advanced robots is problematic, since the tools available for such robots are often in their prototype stage.</p>
<p>“We have built TRE based on the Unity 3D Game Engine to control robots. Unity 3D allows non-programmers to use a set of powerful animation and interaction design tools to visually animate robots.”</p>
<p>Nishiguchi says that one of the greatest features of TRE is the conversational function.</p>
<p>“You can write the script for a conversation virtually on TRE and the robot will talk accordingly. However, it is almost impossible to write down all the possible questions and answers, as people sometimes give a random question that is out of context to the robot.”</p>
<p>Nishiguchi says that to solve the problem they embedded a function, called Chatbot, which is an online database of conversation, and gives proper answers to questions.</p>

<p>“The advantage of scripting is that the conversation is heading to a goal set by the user. On the other hand, Chatbot can answer any random questions. TRE makes use of both advantages,” he says.</p>
<p>“The robot normally talks along the script with the user but if people ask it something unexpected, it connects to Chatbot to answer it.”</p>
<p>The LEGO robot was used to conduct field work at Christchurch’s Imagination Station, located in Christchurch, using TRE. The Imagination Station is a charity run, not-for-profit play and education centre and the first LEGO play and learn centre in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The robot was put by a donation box and asked customers to donate. The Imagination Station completely relies on donations to keep it open and free-of-charge.</p>
<p>“The purpose was to investigate if the robot could naturally convince people to donate through conversation. The robot had to have a natural conversation without irritating people and making them enjoy it.</p>
<p>“We believe that this unconventional integration of technologies has the potential to bring the expertise of integration designers into the process of advanced human-robot interaction projects.”</p>

<p>The results of this project will be presented at the 24th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN2015), in Kobe, Japan in September 2015.</p>
<p>HIT Lab NZ is a human-computer interface research centre hosted at the University of Canterbury. The HIT Lab NZ integrates research and education, providing students with a project-based learning environment.</p>
