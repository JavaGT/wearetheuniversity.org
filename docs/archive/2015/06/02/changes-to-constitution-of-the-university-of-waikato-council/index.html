<p><strong>Changes to the Constitution of the University of Waikato Council</strong></p>
<p>The Education Amendment Act 2015 was passed in February this year and makes significant changes to university governance. A key change is that the number of Council members is reduced to between eight and 12 (the current University of Waikato Council has 18 members).</p>
<p>In response to the new legislation, the University of Waikato Council has proposed a new constitution for effect from 10 December 2015 and is inviting stakeholder feedback, with submissions open until Friday 26 June 2015.</p>
<p>“Regardless of whether members are appointed, either directly by Council or by nomination of stakeholder groups, strategic experience, competencies, behaviour and ability to make informed and independent judgements are the most critical factors for effective governance. While Council’s primary role is governance, it also has a very important role with regard to social responsibility and social good and its constitution should reflect both,” says University of Waikato Chancellor the Rt Hon Jim Bolger.</p>
<p>“Council will consider what mechanisms, other than Council membership, can be used to provide more effective engagement with its stakeholders.”</p>
<p>Under the proposed new constitution, the University of Waikato Council would comprise 12 members as follows:<br>1. Four members appointed by the Minister<br>2. The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Waikato<br>3. One member appointed by the Council after consultation with Te Rōpū Manukura<br>4. One member appointed by the Council after consultation with Te Arikinui<br>5. One staff member appointed by the Council on the nomination of the Academic Board<br>6. One student member appointed by the Council following an election by the students<br>7. Three members appointed directly by the Council, chosen by the Council</p>
<p>It is also proposed that, unless he or she is appointed by virtue of holding a stated office, a person may be a member of Council for a maximum of 16 years.</p>
<p>Submissions on the University’s proposed new constitution are invited and may be made to the Secretary to Council at <a href="mailto:council@waikato.ac.nz">council@waikato.ac.nz</a></p>
