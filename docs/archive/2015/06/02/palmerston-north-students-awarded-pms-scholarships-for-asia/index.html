<p><strong>Media Statement</strong></p>

<p><strong>Local students awarded Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Asia</strong></p>
<p>Local MP Jono Naylor says our next generation need to be able to work in different cultural environments and communicate in different languages as our international and trading links grow – particularly within the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>“The first Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Asia for 2015 have now been awarded and I’m thrilled to see Palmerston North locals Samuel Vanderkolk and Tali Brassington-Crow receive a scholarship which will take them to Singapore and China respectively,” Jono Naylor said.</p>
<p>“This trip will enhance the hard work they are already doing towards their programme of study. Samuel is studying Economics, International Business and History; and Tali is studying Chinese, Linguistics and Second Language Education.</p>
<p>“These scholarships will go a long way to supporting a future of international marketers, traders, diplomats, and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>“We are a trading nation, so it’s important our future workforce have the opportunity to understand some of our most important trading partners while they are studying. A skilled workforce is the engine-room of a thriving economy,” Jono Naylor said.</p>
<p>The scholarships this round will take the recipients to China, Japan, India, Korea, Thailand, or Indonesia.</p>
<p>Applications are now open for the next round of scholarships and close on 30 September 2015. Applications can be made by individuals or groups to Education New Zealand.
