<p><strong>University announces partnership with Christchurch School of Music</strong></p>
<p>The University of Canterbury has today announced a key partnership with the Christchurch School of Music (CSM).</p>
<p>This partnership is part of a wider community engagement initiative being undertaken by the University, which includes partnerships with the Crusaders, Tactix and the Student Volunteer Army (SVA).</p>
<p>University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says the partnership with the CSM and the Christchurch Youth Orchestra (CYO) will provide opportunities to connect with the wider community, including schools.</p>
<p>“We have already announced partnerships with sports organisations that acknowledge the importance sport has in Canterbury. We have focused on our commitment to engaging with the community through the work that the SVA has achieved since the Canterbury earthquakes. This agreement focuses on the cultural community in Canterbury through music,” Dr Carr says.</p>
<p>The partnership with the CSM will see both organisations work together to develop key projects that will help UC engage with music students around Christchurch and throughout the South Island. The orchestra will be renamed the University of Canterbury Christchurch Youth Orchestra.</p>
<p>“We recently made significant changes to the music curriculum, updating and enhancing our programmes with internships and outreach activities, and the opportunity for our orchestral musicians to be a part of a combined UC-CYO orchestra with its high profile concerts and significant community engagement is timely and very exciting,” Dr Carr says.</p>

<p>“The CSM, including the CYO, has a long history of providing music learning opportunities in ways that reach across social and economic barriers, and many of this city&#39;s and this nation&#39;s great musicians and music teachers have at some point been CSM students.”</p>
<p>“The Christchurch Youth Orchestra is the premier youth orchestra in Christchurch and offers talented students aged between 16 and 25 a fantastic training ground for future orchestral playing. Many of our students, past and present, are selected for the prestigious National Youth Orchestra and go on to have very successful careers as orchestral musicians, soloists and teachers. Sponsorship from UC will ensure that these students are given the best possible experience.”</p>
<p>In 2015, CSM is celebrating its 60th anniversary, so the timing of the partnership is particularly significant. The CYO, conducted by CSM alumni Kenneth Young, will perform as part of those celebrations on Saturday 26 September at the Isaac Theatre Royal.</p>
<p>“We recognise the importance of this history and reach, and it aligns with our own history and aspirations. This new partnership is a visible and meaningful one, and we look forward to working more closely with Christchurch’s emerging musicians,” Dr Carr says.</p>
<p>CSM Music Director, Celia Stewart, says the newly formed partnership with UC is an exciting opportunity.</p>
<p>“Participation in the Christchurch Youth Orchestra offers students the opportunity to experience playing some of the great orchestral works and a chance to work with professional conductors,” she says.</p>
<p>“We look forward to working with the UC School of Music to ensure that music students remain in Christchurch to the mutual benefit of both organisations and the Arts community in Christchurch.”</p>
<p>Dr Carr says the University’s partnerships with key organisations like the Christchurch School of Music will help drive student recruitment, retention and help the University to develop stronger community engagement with Christchurch and the wider Canterbury community. The partnerships are being supported by the redirection of promotional budget.</p>
