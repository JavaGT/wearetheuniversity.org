<p>Helping to grow knowledge in garden rooted in past</p>
<p>Lincoln University experts are helping to seed 21st century know-how into a Banks Peninsula iwi market garden with roots dating back to the 19th century.</p>
<p>The University is supporting a collaborative partnership with a focus on growing food at Koukourārata (Port Levy), as part of a new whānau health project led by Koukourārata Rūnanga, one of only 10 South Island whānau groups to receive funding from Whānau Ora Commissioning Agency, Te Pūtahitanga o te Wai Pounamu.</p>
<p>Koukourārata Rūnanga will work with whānau to develop their land enterprises by re-starting a market garden on a site originally used to sell food to early colonists as far back as the 1880s.</p>
<p>To take the project from theory to reality they have sought the support of Lincoln University, the Bio-Protection Research Centre, and specialist organic education science and extension provider, the Biological Husbandry Unit (BHU).</p>
<p>The market garden is expected to become the catalyst for additional farming ventures and education projects.</p>
<p>Lincoln University Chancellor Tom Lambie says the University is pleased to be part of such an important community focused project which aims to enhance economic, environmental and educational outcomes for Māori.</p>
<p>The University will work with the Rūnanga to scope the project, identify suitable sustainable crops, and develop the entire value chain. This may include innovative ideas such as hosting weekend wānanga on traditional Māori practices and foods, as well as sustainable farming practices.</p>

<p>Lincoln and the BHU will look to establish education programmes that can operate alongside, and support the land enterprises.</p>
<p>Involving whānau in sustainable food ventures is part of the Rūnanga’s long-term plan to strengthen the community at Koukourārata (Port Levy).</p>
<p>Past achievements have included substantial riparian planting in Koukourārata waterways, creating Kakanui - a native forest reserve, establishing a mataitai (fishing reserve) in the Bay, and developing a successful joint mussel farming venture, with sustainable seafood company Sanford Limited.</p>
<p>The Rūnanga also plans to co-invest in building a specialist Wānanga, which can host researchers, students and a whole range of guests.</p>
<p>A pōwhiri at Koukourārata (Port Levy) will be held on Saturday 13 June to officially launch the project.</p>
