<p>Wainui students to benefit from sports and leadership programme</p>
<p>National List MP in the Hutt Valley Chris Bishop today welcomed news that Hutt Valley youth development charity Ignite Sport Trust has received government funding of $15,000 to run sports-based leadership and life-skills programmes in Wainuiomata.</p>
<p>Mr Bishop visited Ignite Sport with the Prime Minister this afternoon, before joining 100 Hutt Valley secondary school student leaders for afternoon tea.</p>
<p>“Ignite does fantastic work around the wider Wellington region, changing young people’s lives through sport. They run a range of programmes, encouraging people to use sport to make a difference in their communities, grow as people, and develop their potential,” says Mr Bishop.</p>
<p>“I was privileged to attend the opening of ‘Aspire 2015’ run by Ignite earlier this year with the Minister for Youth, Hon Nikki Kaye. ‘Aspire’ brought together 300 students and 32 sports coordinators from 34 Wellington secondary schools along with 30 top athletes, with the aim of inspiring tomorrow’s sports leaders and empowering, motivating and educating them.</p>
<p>Ignite has been granted $15,000 of ‘services for young people’ funding through the Ministry of Youth Development. Ignite will use the money to run sport-based leadership and life skills programmes, for around 190 students from Wainuiomata Intermediate and Wainuiomata College.</p>
<p>“I’m passionate about developing the potential of Hutt Valley young people. As a born-and-bred Hutt boy myself, I know the huge capacity that exists within our region. I’m keen to support organisations like Ignite that do such great work to unlock that potential”, says Mr Bishop.</p>

<p>In 2013 Ignite Sport won the Supreme Award for voluntary work in the community at an event hosted jointly by Wellington Airport in association with The Community Trust of Wellington. Kevin Goldsbury, Coordinator of Ignite Sport, has over thirty years of youth work and community work experience both as a volunteer and as a full-time practitioner. He has worked predominantly with ‘at risk’ Māori and Pacific Island youth and their families in Petone and the wider Hutt Valley.</p>
