<p>Teachers Being Blamed Unfairly  </p>
<p>Teachers are being blamed unfairly in the latest research report into the way maths is taught, says New Zealand First Deputy Leader and Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“The report criticises teachers for having a poor grasp of maths and blames them for poor students’ results,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
<p>“But in 2010 the Ministry removed school support advisors who delivered onsite workshops and syndicate and teacher professional development, which included the Numeracy Project.</p>
<p>“In 2013, Professor Vince Wright, who coordinated the Ministry-led Numeracy Project from 2000 to 2010, said he was concerned about the lack of improvement. The Ministry failed to act on the issues raised. Was this because he is an educator and not a businessman?</p>
<p>“Doing away with dedicated teacher training colleges was a major step backward for the advancement of several subjects, particularly maths teaching,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of heaping all the blame on teachers yet again, Education Minister Hekia Parata and her Ministry should look in the mirror when it comes to maths results failures. It’s a case of another top down, resourced-starved initiative that our teachers have done their best to deliver every day in the classroom.&quot;</p>
