<p>Recognition for unselfish Fellow  </p>
<p>Lincoln University Professor of Systems Biology Don Kulasiri has had international recognition of his work, being made a Fellow of the Modelling and Simulation Society of Australia and New Zealand (MSSANZ).</p>
<p>MSSANZ is a society for scientists, engineers, economists and social scientists who develop and use computer based models and decision support systems. Professor Kulasiri’s focus is on computational modelling/analysis of biological and environmental systems and Biotechnology and BioSystems engineering.</p>
<p>The award is presented for &#39;unselfish dedication to promoting the aims of the Society, and for outstanding contributions to modelling and simulation&#39;. It allows him to add &#39;FMSSANZ&#39; to the long list of letters behind his name.</p>
<p>He is grateful for the award but wanted to acknowledge the contribution of others.</p>
<p>“More so to my colleagues who work with me in research projects. I would like to thank my current and former PhD students at Lincoln University as well, not to mention everybody else in Lincoln who make things happen.</p>
<p>He has had a long involvement with MSSANZ.</p>
<p>“I presented a paper in 1993 for the first time in Perth, and I have presented, or I have been a co-author of, our papers there ever since. I also co-convened the congress at Canterbury University in 2007.</p>
<p>“I guess I have contributed to the society &quot;unselfishly&quot; to some extent, but my guess would be our research contributions through journal articles and books made the day.”</p>

<p>He is one of only four New Zealanders made Fellows since the society was founded in 1974.</p>
<p>“When I look at the list of people who have been Fellows, they have made significant and sustained original contributions to research and/or have a long-term dedication to the society.</p>
<p>“Some big names are awarded medals and fellowships by the society (including a Nobel laureate) so I guess I am in a good company,” he says.</p>
<p>The Fellowship awards are given every two years at MSSANZ’s International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, this year on the Gold Coast in December.</p>
<p>“It has become a large event over the years and, for example, more than 800 refereed papers will be presented and the proceedings of MSSANZ are internationally recognised and accessed through major databases.</p>
<p>“Regular contingents of scientists from Europe and North America attend these congresses which are highly publicised in Australia,” Professor Kulasiri says.</p>
