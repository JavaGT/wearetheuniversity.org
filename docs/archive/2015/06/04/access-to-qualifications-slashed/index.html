<p>4 June 2015 MEDIA STATEMENT<br><strong>Access to qualifications slashed</strong></p>
<p>The National Government has declared war on the next generation with a plan to axe two- thirds of New Zealand’s qualifications, Labour Tertiary Education spokesperson David Cunliffe says.</p>
<p>In answer to Labour’s written Parliamentary question, Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce has revealed a plan to slash the number of Level 1-6 qualifications from 3,593 to 1,204.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce’s ‘<a href="http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/studying-in-new-zealand/understand-nz-quals/targeted-review-of-qualifications/">targeted review of qualifications’</a> is appropriately named – because the Minister has targeted the aspirations of young New Zealanders,” David Cunliffe says.</p>
<p>“National will attempt to paint this slash and burn exercise as making the qualification system ‘more relevant to some employers and industry’.</p>
<p>“However what this really means is higher student loans as students are forced to take more general studies – rather than highly targeted courses – to meet their professional ambitions.</p>
<p>“Now we know why Budget 2015 banks future ‘savings’ from lower tertiary student numbers. It’s because there’ll be thousands fewer qualifications for students to enrol in.</p>
<p>“Students know the path to their future success is through education, but now National is taking away two-thirds of their options,” David Cunliffe says.</p>
