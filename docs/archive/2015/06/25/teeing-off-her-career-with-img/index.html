<p><strong>Teeing off her career with IMG</strong></p>
<p>Sir Edmund Hillary golf scholar Hana-Rae Seifert could soon be working with some of the world&#39;s top sports stars. She&#39;s on her way to London to take up a nine-week internship with international sports management giant IMG which represents the likes of Lydia Ko and Novak Djokovic.</p>
<p>&quot;The internship is the perfect opportunity to combine both my practical experience as an athlete and my theoretical knowledge learnt through my law and sports degree,&quot; says Hana-Rae. &quot;It epitomises what the Hillary Scholarship at Waikato has allowed me to do in the past four years and I will be forever grateful for its flexibility and support.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s been a five-month application process for Hana-Rae, including various written applications and gruelling Skype interviews at all hours of the morning.</p>
<p>&quot;One morning I had to get up at 1.30am to do a 20 minute presentation on how IMG could acquire new golf clients,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>IMG is a global leader in sports management and runs some of the world&#39;s most recognised events, such as The Open Championship and Wimbledon, both of which Hana-Rae will be working at.</p>
<p>&quot;There were thousands of applicants from all over the world and only one internship being offered in the golf clients division, so I feel extremely honoured to have been selected,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>The internship will run from mid-June until the end of August but Hana-Rae hopes the opportunities won&#39;t end there. &quot;I feel like this is a step in the right direction for my future, I can definitely see myself following a career with IMG. Who knows, I might be Lydia Ko&#39;s manager before you know it!&quot;</p>

<p>Hana-Rae attributes many of her successes to the support and flexibility offered by Waikato University&#39;s Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship Programme which has allowed her to follow both her passions for study and golf. &quot;And of course I couldn&#39;t have done any of this without the love and support from my family,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>The former Head Girl of St Peter&#39;s School is currently in her sixth year studying Law and Sport and Leisure Studies.</p>
<p>Hana-Rae is in the New Zealand High Performance Squad for golf and a Waikato representative. Her recent golfing success includes an eight-week tournament campaign to the UK and Europe where she made the cut in all events.</p>
