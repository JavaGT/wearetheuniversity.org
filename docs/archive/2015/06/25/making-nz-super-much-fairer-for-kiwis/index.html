<p><strong>Thursday, 25 June 2015, 2:23 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Making NZ Super Much Fairer for Kiwis</strong></p>
<p>A New Zealand First Bill changing the eligibility for NZ Super was today selected to be introduced to Parliament.</p>
<p>“The intention is for NZ Super to be more fairly allocated,” says New Zealand First MP Denis O’Rourke, who proposed the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income (Pro Rata Entitlement) Amendment Bill.</p>
<p>“The amount paid would depend on how many years the recipient has been resident in the country.</p>
<p>“For example, there are about 80,000 people who immigrated when they were over the age of 50, gained residency, and have become eligible for NZ Super at 65. They may never have worked in New Zealand, paid taxes and contributed to NZ Super. This is unfair to Kiwis who have lived and worked here all their lives.</p>
<p>“The Bill will also future proof against the demand of hundreds of thousands who may return to New Zealand after decades of working and gaining pensions overseas, these people may include immigrants who used New Zealand as a back-door entry to Australia.</p>
<p>“As other countries raise the age for pensions, and otherwise tighten eligibility, New Zealand might be seen as a soft option. We could have a flood of older people.</p>
<p>“The Bill will bring relief for over 70,000 whose overseas pensions are now deducted from NZ Super. The Bill will allow them to keep their pensions, and they will be eligible for NZ Super on the length of time they have been resident and present in New Zealand. They will be pleased that New Zealand First had the courage to tackle the issue for them.”</p>
