<p><strong>Taxpayers paying for TV watching</strong></p>
<p>Sky-high spending by the Government on pay television subscriptions is costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars, Labour’s State Services spokesperson Kris Faafoi says.</p>
<p>Documents obtained by Labour show government departments have spent more than $360,000 on pay television subscriptions over the past two years.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade racked up the biggest bill with an average annual spend of $98,340 spend across 2013/14.</p>
<p>“The second most extravagant department was Internal Affairs ($33,408), and the third was the New Zealand Transport Agency.</p>
<p>“NZTA’s pay television costs were a whopping $19,307 in 2013/14. Now there may be some justification for MFAT and even DIA to have connected offices but why the Transport Agency needs to fork out nearly $20,000 to watch TV is beyond me.</p>
<p>“Surely they should have their eye on the traffic monitors, not on Top Gear re-runs or the Deadliest Catch, and Road Cops is on free-view.</p>
<p>“It’s little wonder that National can’t balance its books. Hard-earned taxpayer money has paid for watching the small screen - not on watching spending.</p>
<p>“The Government has some serious explaining to do regarding the astronomical tab being racked up on pay TV subscription,” Kris Faafoi says.</p>
