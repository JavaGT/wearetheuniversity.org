<p><strong>Government must keep Relationships Aotearoa going</strong></p>
<p>The Government should continue funding Relationships Aotearoa until such time as there are other providers ready to continue the services they provide, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>Relationships Aotearoa says thousands of its clients will be left without counselling support when it closes its doors on Tuesday. Currently only one organisation is negotiating with the Government to continue providing the services Relationships Aotearoa is responsible for.</p>
<p>“Thousands of clients of <em>Relationships Aotearoa</em> need certainty around their ability to continue getting counselling services,” Green Party social development spokesperson Jan Logie said today.</p>
<p>“If the Government didn’t have a plan in place to continue providing the services <em>Relationships Aotearoa</em> provide then they should have provided the financial ability for <em>Relationships Aotearoa</em> to continue.</p>
<p>“<em>Relationships Aotearoa</em> is New Zealand’s largest counselling service and it is simply irresponsible of the Government to let it fail.</p>
<p>“It is also foolish to have left such a short time for finding alternative providers. Having only one organisation bidding to keep providing the services of <em>Relationships Aotearoa</em> puts the Government in a very weak bargaining position.</p>
<p>“The way the Government has handled this issue is yet another example of a Government that has no care for the services provided by the state.</p>
<p><em>“Relationships Aotearoa</em> assists couples in trouble and provides an essential service to vulnerable New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“It is not too late for the Government to provide a last minute reprieve that provides some relief for the clients of <em>Relationships Aotearoa</em>, those that work for the organisation, and the wider community,” Ms Logie said.</p>
