<p>Queen’s Birthday Honours for services to universities</p>
<p>3 June 2015</p>
<p>University Vice-Chancellors have congratulated Professor Roy Crawford and Dr John Wood who were appointed Companions to the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to tertiary education in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list.</p>
<p>Professor Roy Crawford is the previous Chair of Universities New Zealand and recently retired Vice-Chancellor of the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>Current Chair Professor Harlene Hayne, says Professor Crawford has made a significant contribution to tertiary education through his research work, his role as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Waikato, and his time as Chair of Universities New Zealand.</p>
<p>During his ten years as Vice-Chancellor at Waikato, Professor Crawford focused on research to drive innovation and entrepreneurship. Upon his retirement there were six research centres at Waikato, all offering doctoral and masters scholarships; Waikato was ranked 44th in the world for the top 100 young universities; and ranked in the top 150 universities in the world across seven subjects. He also forged close relationships across the region and internationally. Today it’s estimated the University of Waikato contributes nearly $1billion per annum to the local economy.</p>
<p>As Chair of Universities New Zealand, Professor Crawford repositioned the organisation as a strategic think tank to inform and influence decision-making on sector issues.</p>
<p>Dr John Wood, Chancellor of the University of Canterbury, was recognised for his services to tertiary education and Māori.</p>

<p>He has served on the University of Canterbury Council since 2007, becoming Pro-Chancellor from 2008 and he was elected Chancellor in 2012.</p>
<p>Professor Hayne says the award recognises the significant contribution and leadership role Dr Wood has made to the University.</p>
<p>Most notably he led the University Council through the difficult aftermath of the Canterbury earthquakes in 2010 and 2011 and oversaw the development and adoption of the recovery and transformation plan, called “UC Futures - How UC will support Canterbury&#39;s renewal”.</p>
<p>Dr Wood has also led changes to the size and composition of the University Council. In addition he has been a Trustee of the University of Canterbury Foundation since 2006; served as an advisor to the College of Arts, as President of the Canterbury History Foundation since 2013 and was the University&#39;s appointed member to the Canterbury Museum Trust Board. He has been a member of Lincoln University&#39;s Council since 2013. He has been a member of the Governing Board of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia since 2008. He has also Chief Crown Negotiator for a number of Treaty settlements.</p>
<p>“Our universities and our country have benefited from the work and wisdom of these two leaders. It’s therefore fitting that they in turn have been recognised for their outstanding contribution,” says Professor Hayne.</p>
