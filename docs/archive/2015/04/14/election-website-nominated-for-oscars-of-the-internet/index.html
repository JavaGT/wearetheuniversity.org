<p>Election website nominated for Oscars of the Internet</p>
<p>On The Fence – an interactive web tool devised by Massey design students – has been nominated for a Webby Award.</p>
<p>The Webbies are the annual awards for excellence on the Internet, with nominees selected by The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>On The Fence is the only non-American nomination in the People’s Voice category of ‘political blog/websites’. The web tool started life in 2011 as a student design project to help young undecided and first-time voters to make informed electoral choices and transform disengaged youth into active civic participants. Users indicate how they feel about a selection of issues statements, to find out which political parties most closely reflect their views.</p>
<p>In 2014, Massey University’s Design and Democracy Project, part of design studio Open Lab, partnered with Springload, an award-winning New Zealand web company, to redevelop the tool based on user feedback.</p>
<p>The other four nominees in the political blog/websites category are Rolling Stone magazine’s online coverage of America’s Gun Violence Epidemic, and US political news/commentary sites factcheck.org, truthdig, and politico. Winners of The Webbies People Voice awards are determined by the number of popular votes nominees receive.</p>
<p>Springload chief executive Bron Thomson says the company is delighted at the nomination. “Springload believe the web can make a genuine difference to society and we’ve found awesome, talented and like-minded partners in Massey University. The biggest challenge of this project was creating a great experience on just about any smart device. We’ve built On The Fence to scale – it’s easy to swap out the New Zealand vernacular so that it will work for other democracies.”</p>

<p>In the 2014 General Election, On The Fence encouraged 30,000 non-voting 18-34 year olds to vote, representing 7% of the total eligible youth population.</p>
<p>Director of the Design and Democracy Project, Karl Kane, says On The Fence helps meet the need for non-partisan information about political options. “Young people are not politically apathetic but they aren’t voting – there’s a difference. Party-political tribalism and spin is a turn-off for them; they want to make values-based choices. That is why On The Fence puts issues first and asks people to think about what they believe.”</p>
