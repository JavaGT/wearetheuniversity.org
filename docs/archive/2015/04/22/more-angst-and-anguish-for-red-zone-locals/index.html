<p>More angst and anguish for red zone locals</p>
<p>Local residents will be bitterly disappointed by the Government’s cherry picking of the Supreme Court’s decision regarding compensation for red zoned property owners, Labour Canterbury Earthquake Recovery spokesperson and Port Hills MP Ruth Dyson says.</p>
<p>“Home owners have taken all the legal action they can, including going to the Supreme Court. Minister Gerry Brownlee now wants to subject them to a <a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-process-red-zone-crown-offers">further court</a> - that of public opinion.</p>
<p>“He could save considerable angst and taxpayers&#39; money by just making them a fair offer. He seems to have an allergy to doing the right thing in this situation, preferring to drag the process out for as long as possible.</p>
<p>“He is subjecting locals to indignity and delay and the potential of further litigation. How much taxpayer money has already been spent on this matter?</p>
<p>“A fair offer to these red zoned home owners would allow them to get on with their lives. Surely that’s not too much to ask four-and-a-half years on from the initial quake.</p>
<p>“Further delay is unwarranted and unfair,” Ruth Dyson says.</p>
