<p>Time for a plastic bag-free NZ</p>
<p>The Green Party has launched a campaign to create a plastic-bag free New Zealand and is calling on the Government to legislate to phase plastic bags out.</p>
<p>Green Party waste spokesperson Denise Roche is leading the charge and is canvassing the country for support from consumers and retailers.</p>
<p>“Thousands of New Zealanders already choose a reusable bag rather than plastic when they’re at the supermarket or shops – it’s time for John Key and the Government to get with the programme and show some leadership on this issue,” said Green Party waste spokesperson Denis Roche.</p>
<p>“There is a global movement to stop using plastic bags and we are lagging behind.</p>
<p>“If we want to keep our clean, green reputation, we need to join Ireland, Bangladesh and Rwanda, as well as various states in Australia and the US, and phase them out.</p>
<p>“These bags, which are extremely difficult to dispose of, cause irreparable damage to our seas and wildlife.</p>
<p>“Anyone who’s seen a photo of a dead whale or dolphin that’s ingested a plastic bag will know how destructive they are.</p>
<p>“Plastic bags also produce thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions a year, contributing to climate change.</p>
<p>“We want the Government to declare plastic bags a priority product under the Waste Minimisation Act 2005 so that we can restrict and ultimately phase out their use.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders are already showing their dislike of plastic bags and preference for reusable – now we need John Key and the Government to follow suit,” said Ms Roche.</p>
