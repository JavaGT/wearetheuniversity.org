<p>Our health not optional, students tell reluctant landlords</p>
<p>15 April 2015</p>
<p>New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations</p>
<p>The national student union is calling for the Government to urgently introduce minimum heating and insulation standards for rentals off the back of <a href="http://www.students.org.nz/r?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.radionz.co.nz%2Fnews%2Fnational%2F271094%2Flandlords-reluctant-on-insulation-scheme&e=4236cfde8d142a4e913140d100895c4855638393&utm_source=students&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=landlords_wof&n=1">reports by Radio New Zealand</a> that some landlords are not willing to insulate cheaper properties.</p>
<p>The call echoes statements from Green MP Kevin Hague and Labour MP Poto Williams, both of whom said the slow pick up showed the need for legislation.</p>
<p>National student president Rory McCourt says “Students are often at the bottom of the heap when it comes to quality of housing. In lieu of standards it’s clear that some landlords think the good health of their tenants is optional. It shouldn’t be.”</p>
<p>“Clearly the market isn’t working. Students are paying more than ever in rent, but their flats remain cold and damp. Given how much students are forking out for flats, we think landlords can and should foot the bill – especially when there’s a subsidy.”</p>
<p>“Gone are the days when it was a badge of honour to make it through the winter in a crappy flat. With constant assessment and a majority of students working over 15 hours a week to pay for skyrocketing rents, there is simply no time to be sick. The Government needs to step in – and fast.” says McCourt.</p>
