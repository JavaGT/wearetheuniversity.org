<p>Award winner valuing degree  </p>
<p>New graduate James Hyde has claimed The Property Institute of New Zealand Student of the Year Prize awarded to the top student completing the Bachelor of Commerce in Valuation and Property Management (VAPM) at Lincoln University.</p>
<p>He achieved this with an average of 76 per cent in the specified 300 level courses.</p>
<p>“I have always wanted to get into property investment and saw this degree as a great way to get into a career that will give me knowledge and experience to become a successful investor,” James says.</p>
<p>“Another reason that I chose the valuation degree was that I saw it was a degree that had good career and job prospects.”</p>
<p>A pragmatic approach to life after study is one which would seem to befit the prize-winner, however.</p>
<p>He has chosen a circuitous, but profitable route which he intends to lead back to using his degree— one which involves seeing the world and earning some cash.</p>
<p>He is now in Perth working in the mines there.</p>
<p>“I made this decision to work in the mines as it was the best way to make good money and save fast. My plan is to have my student loan paid off and have enough money saved to travel for a few years by the end of 2015,” James says.</p>
<p>“At this stage after my travelling I don&#39;t know where I want to settle down but I will definitely begin a career in valuation.”</p>
<p>He was steered to Lincoln through the influence of a family member already in the field.</p>
<p>“My uncle owns a valuation business in Nelson and he was the main person who sparked my interest in the valuation degree at Lincoln University,” James says.</p>
