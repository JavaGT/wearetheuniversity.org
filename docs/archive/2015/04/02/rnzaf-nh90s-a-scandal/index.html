<p><strong>RNZAF NH90’s a Scandal</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand First believes the purchase of the Air Force’s state-of-the-art NH90 helicopters verges on a scandal.</p>
<p>“Even the Minister of Defence Gerry Brownlee, questioned by New Zealand First in Parliament, conceded there are significant issues with the helicopters, bought for $771 million,” says New Zealand First Defence Spokesperson Ron Mark.</p>
<p>“The NH90’s, the light armoured vehicle (LAV) over-purchase and the potential purchase of C17 aircraft without a study is why we cannot trust National/Labour governments to make the right decisions on defence.</p>
<p>“<em>HMNZS Canterbury</em> was deliberately built with hangar space for two NH90 medium helicopters, a quarter of our fleet, but Cyclone Pam now shows us the debacle this acquisition was,” says Mr Mark.</p>
<p>“While hugely capable the helicopters we purchased risk serious corrosion damage if taken to sea. They cannot easily operate off allied ships or future vessels like Helicopter Platform Docks as there is no automated blade and tail folding system.</p>
<p>“Even the Royal Netherlands Navy halted deliveries last year of its navalised NH90’s due to corrosion issues. <a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/dutch-nh90-deliveries-to-resume-407168/">They only resumed after 75 fixes and €100 million</a> but the last Labour government here unwisely purchased the variant designed for land operations.</p>

<p>“That’s madness given we are surrounded by sea and our helicopters are likely to operate in the Pacific not central Europe. We have lodged a question with the Minister of Defence to ask what the cost of a retrofit would be assuming it is even possible.</p>
<p>“Cyclone Pam also shows up the need for new tactical airlifters but we suspect the government has already decided on the strategic C17. That’s without studying the <a href="http://militaryaircraft-airbusds.com/aircraft/a400m/a400mabout.aspx">Airbus A400M</a> or tactical airlifters like the <a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/c130/c-130j-variants/c-130j-30.html">C130J-30 Super Hercules</a>and <a href="http://www.embraerds.com/english/content/cargo/overview.asp">Embraer’s new KC-390</a>,” says Mr Mark.</p>
