<p>Lower dairy prices highlight lack of economic diversity  </p>
<p>Further falls in dairy prices overnight highlight why New Zealand needs to diversify its economy, the Green Party said today.</p>
<p>Global dairy commodity prices fell further overnight. Whole milk powder, a key price for Fonterra&#39;s pay out to farmers, fell another 13.3 percent to $US2538 a tonne.</p>
<p>“Our overwhelming economic focus on dairy exports makes New Zealand extremely vulnerable to global dairy prices,” Green Party Co-leader Russel Norman said.</p>
<p>“Dairy will continue to be an important export sector for New Zealand, but the National Government is failing to diversify the economy or present New Zealand with a credible long-term economic strategy.</p>
<p>“New Zealand needs a smart, low-carbon economy which adds value to our exports and comes from a diverse base. That would lead to a stronger future and better jobs for New Zealanders.”</p>
<p>National plan to invest heavily in further dairy conversions. State-owned enterprise Landcorp is converting more than 25,700 hectares of pine forest in the upper Waikato to dairy. Once completed, the catchment will be home to 30,000 more dairy cows.</p>
<p>“National’s plans for massive dairy conversions in the Waikato are both economically and environmentally irresponsible,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>“This is not the time to be investing heavily in dairying when oversupply is already hurting dairy prices and the Waikato river will not be able to take a further 700 tonnes more nitrogen per year.</p>
<p>“The Government and Landcorp should do the right thing for our farmers and our environment and support a moratorium on further dairy conversions. There’s only so much the environment can take, and we believe we’re at that point.</p>

<p>“The Government can put controls on intensification, through its National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management, and help incentivise economic diversification by boosting investment in research and development.</p>
<p>“The Business Operations Survey, released in late March, shows that the proportion of businesses investing in R&amp;D is just eight percent and this number hasn’t changed since 2009. National’s R&amp;D experiment is clearly not working either.”</p>
