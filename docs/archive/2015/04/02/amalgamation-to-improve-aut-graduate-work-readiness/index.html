<p><strong>Amalgamation to improve AUT graduate work readiness</strong></p>
<p>AUT University has announced the amalgamation of its School of Engineering and School of Computer and Mathematical Sciences in a move reflecting global trends to ensure better study and work opportunities for students.</p>
<p>Dean of the Faculty of Design and Creative Technologies, Professor Desna Jury, says AUT is responding to the need to align study and research with industry requirements and give AUT graduates an edge in work readiness.</p>
<p>“We’re listening to the New Zealand Government and to industry and believe the new School of Engineering, Computer and Mathematical Sciences will put AUT at the forefront of curriculum trends and capable of even greater research collaboration.</p>
<p>“This will provide more opportunities for AUT students and help address industry needs for work-ready graduates who have received quality academic learning across interlinking fields,” said Professor Jury.</p>
<p>The new school will begin formal operation at the beginning of 2016 and is expected to have six departments: Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Built Environment, Computer Science, Information Technology and Mathematical Sciences.</p>
<p>A new precinct, due for completion in 2018, will house the new School so departments can be co-located.</p>
<p>Senior staff have already been appointed. Professor Enrico Haemmerle will be seconded to Head the amalgamated School of Engineering, Computer and Mathematical Sciences from November 2015. Professor Tek Jjing Lie has accepted a secondment as Deputy Head, School of Engineering, Computer and Mathematical Sciences and Associate Professor Jairo Gutierrez will also be seconded to the role of Deputy Head, School of Engineering, Computer and Mathematical Sciences.</p>
<p>In October this year, Professor Philip Sallis will complete a secondment to the role of Head of School, Computer and Mathematical Sciences, and return to his leadership role in the University as Pro Vice-Chancellor. He will continue in his professorial and research role in the Faculty.</p>
