<p><strong>Smart ties with India</strong></p>
<p>Lincoln University has strengthened its ties with business in India after signing Memoranda of Understanding with ETI Dynamics and JCurve Ventures which emphasise the development ‘smart cities’.</p>
<p>The agreements come after a recent visit by an Indian trade delegation to the University, which was hosted by Vice-Chancellor Dr Andrew West, Deputy Vice-Chancellor International and Business Development Jeremy Baker, and Peter Barrowclough, Chief Executive Officer of Lincoln Agritech Ltd, a 100 per cent owned subsidiary of Lincoln University.</p>
<p>The group was visiting New Zealand on the invitation of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, the Canterbury Employers’ Chamber of Commerce and the Canterbury Development Corporation. The members were here to explore business opportunities in Christchurch, particularly with regard to environmentally-sustainable technology.</p>
<p>ETI Dynamics is an infrastructure developer and investor in sustainable development projects in areas such as water, energy, waste and urban transportation. JCurve is an advisory company providing expertise in logistics, technology, infrastructure and investment.</p>
<p>According to Lincoln University’s Business Development Manager Dr Samuel Yu, the memoranda provide an excellent opportunity to create strong partnerships with influential Indian organisations.</p>
<p>“These agreements give Lincoln the ability to better access a region of the world that comes with massive potential. By 2025, some 30 per cent of the world’s workforce will be in India.</p>

<p>“This means we can look to scale up our technology packages and educational expertise.</p>
<p>“Smart cities are not just about the urban landscape, but the surrounding resources and the infrastructure that supports them. This includes agritech, and tools designed to better manage energy and environmental resources.</p>
<p>“This is very much the space Lincoln is in, and this agreement gives us the opportunity to share common ambitions.”</p>
<p>The memoranda were signed by Mr Sanmit Ahuja and Mr Bharat Joshi of ETI Dynamics and JCurve Ventures respectively.</p>
<p>During the visit, Peter Barrowclough of Lincoln Agritech Ltd and Senior Lecturer in Software and Information Technology, Dr Patricia Anthony, presented a range of agricultural technologies developed by specialists at Lincoln, including drone-collected data management, smart irrigation systems, and design planning software.</p>
