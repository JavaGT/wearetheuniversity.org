<p><strong>Key element in bacterial immune system discovered</strong></p>
<p>A University of Otago scientist is a member of an international research team that has made an important discovery about the workings of a bacterial immune system. The finding could lead to the development of tailor-made RNA-editing tools.</p>
<p>RNA is the molecule that translates DNA’s genetic instructions into the production of the proteins that are the building blocks of cells.</p>
<p>In a recent paper in the leading journal <em>Science</em>, the team has shown how a surveillance complex in the bacterial immune system is able to target specific sites on RNA molecules to destroy invading viruses and other foreign genetic elements.</p>
<p>The researchers, who include Otago postdoctoral fellow Dr Raymond Staals, believe this targeting mechanism could one day be adapted to engineer microbes to serve a variety of purposes, including environmental clean-up, green chemistry, and the production of safer, more effective therapeutic drugs.</p>
<p>In their paper, the team have provided the first high-resolution structural images of a fully intact Type III CRISPR-Cas surveillance complex bound to its target RNA, thereby showing how the RNA-targeting mechanism in this complex works.</p>
<p>Dr Staals, who is based in Otago’s Department of Microbiology &amp; Immunology, says the complex recognises and snips single-stranded RNA molecules at multiple sites allowing bacteria to destroy viral genetic material before it hijacks their cells.</p>
<p>“A hand-like structure in the complex grips the RNA target, and then a thumb-like structure on the hand pushes the RNA into the right position in the catalytic site to be cleaved,” he says.</p>

<p>The researchers say the structural data they have gained suggests ways in which this RNA-targeting mechanism could potentially be re-purposed for RNA-interference applications.</p>
<p>RNA interference is a natural mechanism involved in sequence-specific gene silencing and holds promise for revolutionising areas such as medicine, where specific genes in diseased tissues could be selectively turned off.</p>
<p>“It is quite exciting to think that a tool that has evolved through the eternal invisible war fought between bacteria and viruses could one day be adapted to effectively and safely treat deadly human diseases,” Dr Staals says.</p>
