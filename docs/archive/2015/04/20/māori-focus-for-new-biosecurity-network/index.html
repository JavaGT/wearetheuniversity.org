<p>Māori focus for new biosecurity network</p>
<p>The Bio-Protection Research Centre, in conjunction with Lincoln University, is facilitating the establishment of a National Māori Biosecurity Network to help manage and protect New Zealand from biosecurity incursions.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Network is to connect Māori organisations with researchers and provide a culturally safe place for Māori to discuss biosecurity issues of importance to them.</p>
<p>Raising awareness of these biosecurity threats and connecting people are key to building a healthy future for New Zealand’s Biological Heritage, says network leader Dr Amanda Black a lecturer in the Bio-Protection Research Centre at Lincoln University.</p>
<p>“We will examine the environmental and economic impacts of biosecurity incursions on our native species and take a bicultural approach to their protection and management,” says Dr Black.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s growing international trade and tourism, and our changing climate are all likely to increase the risks of new pests or diseases establishing here.</p>
<p>While biosecurity incursions are a threat to New Zealand agribusiness, they also threaten culturally significant native species and the ecosystems they support. Kauri are being killed by a fungus-like disease thought to have been introduced from overseas, and manuka, kanuka and pohutakawa are all at risk if the myrtle rust fungus, which has been devastating forests in Australia, finds its way here.</p>
<p>“We need to take our best educated guess at which insect pests or disease-causing organisms may be the next to reach our shores and begin preparing for them,” says Dr Black.</p>

<p>Dr Black will be supported by a team of researchers with members from organisations across New Zealand, including Melanie Mark-Shadbolt and Dr Robert Hill from Lincoln University, Dr Nick Waipara from Auckland Council and Dr Philip Wilcox from Scion, Rotorua.</p>
<p>A series of regional hui in Auckland, Tauranga, Napier, Nelson, Wellington and Christchurch will begin the process of dialogue. The team consider these places to be biosecurity ‘hotspots’ in New Zealand, with multiple entry points for travellers and overseas goods.</p>
<p>The Network has support from the Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment’s Vision Mātauranga Science Fund, which aims to grow skills and capacity in science and innovation, while supporting outcomes that benefit Māori and New Zealand.</p>
