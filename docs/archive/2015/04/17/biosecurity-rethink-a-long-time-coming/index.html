<p>Primary Industries Spokesperson</p>
<p>17 April 2015 MEDIA STATEMENT  </p>
<p><strong>Biosecurity rethink a long time coming</strong></p>
<p>The Government has opened New Zealand’s borders to biosecurity risks and its rethinking of bag screening at airports is an admission of failure, Labour’s Primary Industries spokesperson Damien O’Connor says.</p>
<p>Nathan Guy today announced a review of biosecurity systems in the wake of numerous fruitfly outbreaks after a decision to stop x-raying 100 per cent of bags four years ago.</p>
<p>Documents obtained by Labour show senior ministry staff expressed serious concerns about the basis for the Government’s decision, including a flawed survey that was used to show trans-Tasman travellers were a low risk.</p>
<p>“The Government has put our horticulture and agriculture industries at risk with its ill-conceived plans and lack of proper process.</p>
<p>“In his haste to speed up trans-Tasman travel, the Prime Minister rushed through the decision to remove 100 per cent bag-screening, something that rightly appalled growers and farmers.</p>
<p>“An Auditor-General’s report in 2013 identified a large number of deficiencies within our biosecurity – one of them being that John Key’s Smart Gate’ system has allowed hundreds of thousands of visitors to walk across our border unchecked.</p>
<p>“That it’s taken Nathan Guy years to move on the issue is a disgrace,” Damien O’Connor says.</p>
