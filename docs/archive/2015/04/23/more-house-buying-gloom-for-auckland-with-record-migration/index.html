<p><strong>More House Buying Gloom for Aucklanders with Record Migration</strong></p>
<p>The latest record migration figures continue to cast a shadow of gloom over Auckland house hunters, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“Uncontrolled migration, with over a thousand people flooding in each week, adds fuel to the already overheated Auckland property market,” says New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“In the year to March net migration reached 56,000. Most new immigrants are settling in Auckland, and they will all need a house, yet Housing Minister Nick Smith claims immigration has no affect on soaring demand and prices.</p>
<p>“New Zealand must wind back on immigration and stop sales to non-residents at the very least.</p>
<p>“Mr English’s suggestion that nothing has been overlooked in the government’s efforts to curb the runaway market is plain dumb, stubborn and false.</p>
<p>“Migration is choking the system. Foreign speculation is running rampant.</p>
<p>“A major cause for that is staring the government straight in the face and yet it thinks glib assurances are a substitute for sound policy.</p>
<p>“Mr English is also wrong to say the rest of New Zealand is unaffected by the high prices in Auckland.</p>
<p>“Already Aucklanders are cashing up and moving elsewhere with their home sale profits – as they spend in other towns, up the prices will go.</p>
<p>“Unaffordability will travel around New Zealand as a result of the Auckland market,” says Mr Peters.</p>
