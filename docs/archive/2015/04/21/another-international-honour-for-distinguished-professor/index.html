<p><strong>Another international honour for Distinguished Professor</strong></p>
<p>The head of the newly-formed Massey Institute of Food Science and Technology (MIFST) Distinguished Professor Harjinder Singh has been elected a Fellow of the United States Institute of Food Technologists (IFT).</p>
<p>The IFT is the largest union of food scientists in the world and, for more than 70 years, has been unlocking the potential of the food science community by creating a global forum comprising of members from more than 95 countries. The IFT focuses on food security, food safety, sustainability and food education.</p>
<p>Professor Singh says it is an honour to have been elected a Fellow.</p>
<p>“It is a further demonstration of the international profile and impact of food science and technology research and education programmes of the Riddet Institute and Massey University.”</p>
<p>Professor Singh says Fellows are expected to take a leadership role within IFT and participate in think-tanks and taskforces. He will travel to Chicago in July to accept the honour.</p>

<p>Distinguished Professor Harjinder Singh</p>
<p>Riddet Institute co-director Distinguished Professor Paul Moughan says Professor Singh’s election is a unique professional distinction given to individuals with outstanding and extraordinary qualifications and experience, as well as for their contribution to the food science and technology field.</p>

<p>“Only 10 or 12 people are elected as Fellows each year, and most are US-based,” he says.</p>
<p>College of Health Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Paul McDonald says New Zealanders are very fortunate to have someone of Professor Singh’s leadership.</p>
<p>“Professor Singh’s world-class expertise as the head of the Massey Institute of Food and Nutrition contributes to making us a leader in food and health innovations in New Zealand, offering integrated research and education across the entire food and health value chain.”</p>
<p>Professor Singh is a key figure helping to align the School of Food and Nutrition with Riddet Institute Centre of Research Excellence-related activities. Professor Singh is the Head of the School of Food and Nutrition and Riddet Innovation, and also serves as co-director of the Riddet Institute CoRE, while Professor Moughan is the other co-director of the Riddet Institute CoRE.</p>
<p>The new organisation allows students to benefit from the best of both worlds with excellent academic and teaching programmes on one hand, combined with world-class research opportunities Professor Singh says. The collaboration will ensure leading-edge programmes for students, who will graduate with exciting careers in food innovation, and a better understanding of the big food and nutrition issues facing New Zealand and the world.</p>
