<p><strong>Addiction symposium tackles multiple issues</strong></p>
<p>The sixth annual National Addiction Research Symposium gets underway on April 22 at Massey University’s SHORE &amp; Whariki Centre in central Auckland, aiming to tackle both traditional and ‘new’ substance use issues.</p>
<p>Senior researcher in drugs and one of the organisers of the symposia Dr Chris Wilkins says it’s the first time Massey University has hosted the event, which is run in collaboration with the Universities of Auckland, Otago, Victoria and Canterbury, Matua Raki, and the Health Promotion Agency.</p>
<p>“This symposium provides a forum for New Zealand addiction researchers and post-graduate students from all disciplines to meet and share their recent research, and to allow for focused discussions on alcohol, legal high and other drug issues of common interest to researchers, policymakers and the wider public,” he says.</p>
<p>Presentations include what happens when recreational drug users turn up at emergency departments suffering from adverse effects, by Dr Paul Quigley from the Christchurch District Health Board Emergency Department; Professor Peter Adams from the University of Auckland on the influence the alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceutical industries can have on policy and regulation; and SHORE Director Professor Sally Casswell discussing an international research collaboration measuring the impact of alcohol policy change in 11 countries.</p>
<p>Dr Wilkins will be presenting a paper on the impact of the regulated legal market for new psychoactive substances (also known as “legal highs”) and other drug use in central Auckland following the passage of the <em>Psychoactive Substances Act</em> 2013.</p>
<p>The day-long symposium also enables student researchers to present and be supported by senior researchers in the addictions field.</p>
<p>Registration is free and the meeting is open to the public.</p>
