<p><strong>Research into Nelson Lakes National Park methane discharge</strong></p>
<p><strong>April 20, 2015</strong></p>
<p>A University of Canterbury postgraduate geology student has been exploring Red Hills in the Nelson Lakes National Park for groundwater springs where a significant amount of methane is being released to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Joanna Pawson’s thesis investigations could help explain the release of methane that may be occurring on other planets including Mars. Pawson, who has Ngāti Kahungunu iwi affiliations, graduated last week with a Master of Science degree (First Class Honours).</p>
<p>Her research offers insight on the formation of how organic compounds such as methane form by water interacting with a common olivine-rich rock in a process referred to as serpentinisation.</p>
<p>She says the Nelson National Park methane from Red Hills appears to be generated by water interacting with the iron rich minerals which are abundant in the region.</p>
<p>“This work builds on previous studies which investigated connections between serpentinisation and the origins and proliferation of life in extreme chemical environments on Earth and potentially other planets,” Pawson says.</p>
<p>“It also connects to research looking at the development of life on early Earth and the formation of potential hydrogen and hydrocarbon energy resources.”</p>
<p>Pawson, supervised by Dr Chris Oze, recently presented her results at the American Geophysical Union Annual Conference in San Francisco. Pawson featured in the Maori graduates and graduands ceremony which included specially invited guest, Ngāi Tahu Kaiwhakahaere Tā Mark Solomon.</p>
