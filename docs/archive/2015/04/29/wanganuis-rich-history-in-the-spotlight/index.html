<p><strong>Wanganui’s rich history in the spotlight</strong></p>
<p>Illuminating local stories of WWI, early rugby history, politics in the Depression era, and the lives of early missionaries are among topics in a public seminar series launching in Wanganui on May 3.</p>
<p>Organised by Massey University and the Alexander Heritage and Research Library, the six seminar series will be delivered by researchers from Massey University who have explored Wanganui’s history.</p>
<p>The series offers local people a chance to gain insights and learn about some of the many fascinating events and people who have contributed to the character of their town, says co-organiser Dr Kirsty Carpenter, a senior lecturer in history in the School of Humanities, who lives in Wanganui.</p>
<p>“This is a wonderfully exciting project in the spirit of linking up Massey postgraduate students with the local community that they are writing about,” she says.</p>
<p>Gillian Tasker, Heritage Services Leader at the Alexander Heritage and Research Library, says the library is “delighted” to partner with Massey University to present local history to the wider community.</p>
<p>“Wanganui is a very old community, and one that supports new research into gaining a better understanding of ourselves, where we have come from, and new opportunities for our future,” Ms Tasker says.</p>
<p>The partnership between the library and the University aims to raise awareness of the presence of history in the local community as well as celebrating students embarking on careers in the rich field of New Zealand historical research. It also has the support of Wanganui’s secondary school history teachers.</p>

<p>Dr Carpenter, whose specialist area is the history of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Era (1789-1815), as well as relations between France and New Zealand from 1840 to the present, says there is a great deal of local history in New Zealand that has yet to be uncovered, researched and written about.</p>
<p>She hopes the series will inspire local people to develop a greater awareness of the rich history on their doorstep. It was something she observed while studying history in France, where she says many small communities are involved in sharing, talking about, and promoting the writing of local history.</p>
<p>“I think this is something New Zealanders could adapt from their counterparts in provincial France who support their local historians by eagerly buying whatever is written about the locality, and using it to promote tourism and other municipal cultural activities,” Dr Carpenter says.</p>
<p>A seminar series for next year has already been confirmed. Speakers for 2016 include Massey doctoral students Fiona McKergow, who will speak about women’s material culture in the Wanganui area; Pauline Knuckey, who is examining movie going in the 1960s in New Zealand provinces; and Moyra Cook who is researching Wanganui’s Parliamentary representative John Bryce.</p>
<p>The 2015 seminar series is sponsored by the W H Oliver Humanities Research Academy, and will be run at 2pm on Sundays at the Alexander Heritage and Research Library.</p>
