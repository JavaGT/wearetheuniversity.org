<p><strong>Dame Anne Salmond appointed to the American Philosophical Society</strong></p>
<p>The University of Auckland’s Dame Anne Salmond has been elected as an International member of the American Philosophical Society, the oldest learned society in the US.</p>
<p>Dame Anne is a Distinguished Professor of Māori Studies and Anthropology in the University’s Faculty of Arts.</p>
<p>The American Philosophical Society (APS) is an eminent scholarly organisation of international reputation. Founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1743, the society promotes useful knowledge in the sciences and humanities through excellence in scholarly research, professional meetings, support of young scholars, publications, library resources, a museum and community outreach. The APS is America’s first learned society and has played an important role in American cultural and intellectual life for over 250 years.</p>
<p>Membership in the APS is entirely honorary and reflects extraordinary accomplishments in all fields of intellectual endeavour. Members are nominated and elected by their peers in the Society.</p>
<p>Other members elected at the same time as Dame Anne include Lord Stern, the President of the British Academy; and Thomas Piketty, Professor of Economics at the École des hautes études in Paris.</p>
<p>“It came out of the blue, and is a marvellous and unexpected honour,” Dame Anne says. “I’m deeply indebted to my peers in the US for their kindness, and would like to thank my colleagues in Maori Studies over the years for their guidance, which has been transformative.’</p>

<p>Dame Anne has previously been elected as a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy, and as a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences in the US, the only New Zealander elected to both.</p>
<p>In 2013 Dame Anne was made New Zealander of the Year. She also received the Rutherford Medal from the Royal Society of New Zealand, which is New Zealand&#39;s highest research medal, and was the first social scientist to win this award.</p>
<p>Dean of Arts Professor Robert Greenberg says the membership is great news for Dame Anne and the Faculty of Arts.</p>
<p>“Her wealth of knowledge continues to benefit the University. Her message is destined to reach even more people with this new appointment.”</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
