<p><strong>Wednesday, 29 April 2015, 9:48 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party">Green Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Public to be involved in question time today like never before</strong></p>
<p>Today the public will have a voice in Parliament’s question time in a way they have never had before.</p>
<p>Following the Green Party’s #myclimatequestion campaign, the top questions as voted on by the public will be asked of the Government in question number one in Parliament today.</p>
<p>“Over the last few days the public have submitted hundreds of great questions which they want to hear the Government answer about climate change,” said Green Party co-leader Dr Russel Norman.</p>
<p>“So far over a thousand people have voted on their top question and people still have until midday today to pick their favourite.</p>
<p>“Voters can then tune in to Parliament’s question time at 2pm today to see if their favourite question is asked.</p>
<p>“We think that the age of social media provides great opportunities for the public to be more involved in asking questions of those in power and holding them to account.</p>
<p>“Judging from the response we’ve had, the public agree.</p>
<p>“From the questions submitted for #myclimatequestion it’s also clear that the public are frustrated by a Government that is leading us in the wrong direction on climate change.</p>
<p>“The Government needs to be accountable to the New Zealand public for their inaction on climate change.</p>
<p>“It is all of our future which the Government is threatening by refusing to take action to curb our greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a smarter, greener economy,” said Dr Norman.</p>
<p>Voting is open until midday today here: <a href="http://action.greens.org.nz/myclimatequestion-vote">http://action.greens.org.nz/myclimatequestion-vote</a></p>
