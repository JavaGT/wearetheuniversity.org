<p><strong>Wednesday, 8 April 2015, 3:56 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Funding cuts cost regions vital services</p>
<p>The problems faced by Dunstan Hospital in Central Otago are symptomatic of the Government’s nation-wide neglect of the regions, Labour’s Health spokesperson and Deputy Leader Annette King says.</p>
<p>“Warnings that Dunstan may be forced to turn patients away because of a planned $500,000 funding cut, despite growing demand for its services, will come as no surprise to other local providers.</p>
<p>“National has long had its head in the sand when it comes to the recognising the importance of small, rural hospitals.</p>
<p>“It refused a request for funding for the redevelopment of Dunstan way back in 1998, instead suggesting the community should raise the money.</p>
<p>“It was thanks to a Labour Government that the locals got an upgraded facility, as did other regions including Kaitaia, Thames, Murchison, the Wairarapa , Hawera and Blenheim to name a few.</p>
<p>“Increased demand for its services means Dunstan is now facing new challenges. Any cuts to its budget – and Southern DHB is already operating on a $21 million deficit – will not only cost services but will also cost jobs.</p>
<p>“It’s time for the Government to get real about what’s happening in the provinces and reassure these communities hospital services will be maintained.”</p>
