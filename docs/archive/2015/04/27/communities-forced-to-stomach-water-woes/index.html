<p><strong>Monday, 27 April 2015, 2:53 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Communities forced to stomach water woes</p>
<p>Confirmation by Health Minister Jonathan Coleman that he is to wind up a water quality improvement scheme will leave thousands of Kiwis with no alternative but to continue boiling their drinking water, Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>The Drinking Water Subsidy Scheme was established by Labour in 2005 to improve drinking water systems in communities with up to 5000 people. National revised the scheme in December 2010 - reducing both the criteria and funding pool, forcing ratepayers to pick up additional costs for water improvements – and will scrap it completely in July.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is supposed to be a First World country, yet information obtained by Labour shows thousands of Kiwis continue to be at risk of getting sick because they don’t have clean drinking water.</p>
<p>“In three months’ time all water suppliers that service a population between 101 to 500 people are expected to have ‘taken all practicable steps’ to meet legislative clean-water standards. Currently just 20.7 per cent of them receive water that’s up to scratch.</p>
<p>“Cabinet papers also reveal the Ministry of Health is expecting some 38 applications to be made for a slice of the last $10 million annual funding pool. So far 15 requests for help have been received for a total $15 million.</p>
<p>“To top it off a private company has started a scheme to install free water filtration systems in schools across the country following concerns from a number of rural communities affected by water compliance issues.</p>

<p>“Schools will have to pay for replacement filters every year.</p>
<p>“Once again we have some of our least prosperous communities having to pick up the cost for something the Government should be dealing with.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders like to think we have a clean, green country. When many are still having to boil drinking water to avoid getting some ghastly stomach bug, something is dreadfully wrong. The Government needs to keep the scheme going.”</p>
<p>ends</p>
