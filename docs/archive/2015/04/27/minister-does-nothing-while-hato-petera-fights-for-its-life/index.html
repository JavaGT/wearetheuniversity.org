<p><strong>Monday, 27 April 2015, 2:51 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party">New Zealand First Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Minister Does Nothing While Hato Petera Fights for Its Life</p>
<p>New Zealand First is calling for a mediator to break the impasse between Auckland school Hato Petera and the Catholic Church before the iconic institution is forced to close.</p>
<p>“The school is battling an indecisive church landlord, a falling roll, buildings needing maintenance and a smear campaign by former board members but Education Minister Hekia Parata refuses to intervene,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
<p>“The church says the school property is not for sale, but has given no indication that it will extend the lease beyond five years, therefore the school cannot plan ahead.</p>
<p>“The school is not asking for money, all it needs is the certainty of another 25-year lease so it can raise the money to fix the boarding facilities. Ninety percent of the school’s roll comes from Northland students and they deserve better.</p>
<p>“There is no question that boarding schools are valuable. The success of the In Zone project, a charity set up for student boarding in central Auckland, is testament to that.</p>
<p>“If the government says it is committed to ‘Maori being successful as Maori,’ why does the Minister ignore the needs of this school’s students, while pandering to the whims of profit-making charter schools?</p>
<p>&quot;This is not just a Maori issue, it is an education issue. Hato Petera desperately needs the support of the minister right now. If Hato Petera closes its doors it will be because the minister did nothing,” Mrs Martin said.</p>
