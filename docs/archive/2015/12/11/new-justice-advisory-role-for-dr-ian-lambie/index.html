<p>11 December 2015</p>
<p>Associate Professor Ian Lambie from the University of Auckland’s School of Psychology has been appointed Justice Sector Science Advisor.</p>
<p>In his new role, Dr Lambie will advise on all aspects of the Justice sector including Corrections, Police, Justice, Crown Law and the Serious Fraud Office.</p>
<p>Secretary for Justice Andrew Bridgman said the role would help improve the lives of New Zealanders by advising on the use of best evidence in cross-sector work to reduce crime, victimisation and harm.</p>
<p>Dr Lambie has more than 25 years’ experience as a clinical psychologist in youth offending and youth justice. Over the course of his career he has built strong relationships across the Judiciary, Police and Corrections.</p>
<p>“I am very much looking forward to this new position, it is an area that is very close to my heart and one in which I feel I can make a real contribution,” Dr Lambie said.</p>
<p>“The Justice sector has many skilled and talented people who work on developing good, sound policy and I see my role as supporting that work and promoting science and research to help formulate policies to reduce crime and victimisation.”</p>
<p>Dr Lambie worked for ten years as a clinical psychologist before joining the University of Auckland in 1990 where he has produced a significant body of research on youth offending. His research focuses on adolescents who sexually offend, children who deliberately light fires and children displaying violent and antisocial behaviour.</p>
<p>University of Auckland Dean of Science Professor John Hosking congratulated Dr Lambie on his new appointment.</p>
<p>“Ian is not only extremely experienced and knowledgeable in this field but is highly respected across the sector and I offer my sincere congratulations to him and wish him every success.”</p>
<p>Dr Lambie will continue to work at the University after taking up his new role.</p>
<p>The Justice Sector Science Advisor appointment is part of a network of science advisors established across government by the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor and University of Auckland Distinguished Professor Sir Peter Gluckman. </p>
