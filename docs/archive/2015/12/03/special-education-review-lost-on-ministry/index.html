<p>Special education review lost on Ministry  </p>
<p>The Ministry of Education is using a review of special education to push for further cost cutting instead of hearing pleas to properly fund services, Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.</p>
<p>“This fantastic opportunity to improve the lives of children with special needs has been lost on the Ministry.</p>
<p>“After being told by thousands of parents that students needed better resources, its action plan calls for a value for money assessment of the system to find further savings.</p>
<p>“This follows National cutting the number of early intervention teachers by 8 per cent since taking office, despite parents and teachers calling out for more resourcing in this area.</p>
<p>“There are now 41 fewer frontline special education staff since 2011 – while at the same time the Ministry has increased its public relations staff numbers by almost 200 per cent.</p>
<p>“That has enabled them to produce glossy documents about this review which ignore the fact they have been cutting resources in this area for years.</p>
<p>“Further cuts are not the answer.</p>
<p>“The Ministry’s approach is driven by Hekia Parata. She needs to show leadership here and ensure her officials do the right thing for special needs kids,” Chris Hipkins says.</p>
