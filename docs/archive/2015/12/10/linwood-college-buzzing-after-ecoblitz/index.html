<p><strong>Linwood College buzzing after EcoBlitz</strong></p>
<p>Over 100 Linwood College students had the opportunity to engage in ‘real science’ during a recent ecological survey carried out at the school, an event which the College’s Head of Science says may create pathways to university education not previously considered.</p>
<p>On 30 November EcoBlitz saw College staff and students join staff and graduate students from Lincoln University’s Ecology Department scouring the school grounds in a large scale, rigorously conducted survey to identify what forms of flora and fauna share the site with them. Sites were prepared with a range of devices to gather evidence of different types of creature, including pitfall traps, wax bait stations sweetened with glucose, tracking tunnels and yellow pan traps designed to imitate the appearance of a flower.</p>
<p>Students counted and photographed an astonishing 61 different species and 655 specimens on site. Head of Science Helen Mora says the buzz of excitement and interest was palpable. “This ticks so many boxes for engaging students with science but the biggest win was how excited the kids were. We had them running up to us to tell us what they’d found. It’s an amazing way to give them exposure to scientists and science and make it relevant to them.” She says the EcoBlitz gave students real opportunities to explore huge concepts broken down to a manageable level in their own back yard.</p>

<p>On the cusp of a post-earthquake rebuild, Ms Mora says the school wanted to gather base level data about the school site so that there is a record before embarking on changes. Students are learning about sustainability, environmental issues and how to improve biodiversity at the College, with the potential for a community garden growing plants for their breakfast club.</p>
<p>Students learned techniques for sampling, monitoring methods and how to collate the data before carrying out the survey. Later in the day, they entered that data into a database for access and analysis as the project goes on. Ms Mora says the survey will be repeated bi-annually over the course of the school rebuild so that a picture can be gained, not only of what creatures live in the school grounds, but also what changes are occurring in the natural environment over the next few years.</p>
<p>“Students were able to see how scientists work and how the skills they learned in class relate to the real world, leading to a shift in their views - science is real and so are scientists. The opportunity to collaborate directly with Lincoln University and access their expertise allowed our students and scientists to work together with the science teachers acting as facilitators. Some students may now see university as a possible pathway to a specific career that they hadn’t thought of before.”</p>
