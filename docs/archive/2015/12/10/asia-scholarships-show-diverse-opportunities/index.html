<p>10 December 2015</p>
<p>Twenty four University of Auckland students will receive Prime Minister’s Scholarships to study in Asia early next year.</p>
<p>The Government’s aim is to strengthen personal and cultural connections with New Zealand’s economic partners in Asia.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon believes the scholarships are excellent encouragement for more students to gain international experience as part of their degree.</p>
<p>“International exposure is becoming increasingly important for students as they progress their careers in today’s global work environment,” he says. “We welcome this government scholarship support and partnership with the tertiary sector as it works to better equip students for the future.”</p>
<p>The University aims for one in four of its students graduating with some form of relevant international experience by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>“These awards highlight the diversity of offshore opportunities that students are seeking,” says the University of Auckland’s Director International, Brett Berquist. “As well as the traditional exchange semester, we are seeing students travel offshore for research, language programmes and internships.”<br>Law student Charles Wong received funding to attend a semester at Tsinghua University in China through the University of Auckland’s exchange programme.</p>
<p>He says, “The experience will give me a diversity of views beyond that available in a typical degree. I hope in future to be able to help New Zealand businesses expand into China and the wider Asia Pacific.”</p>
<p>Raagini Vijaykumar is studying a conjoint Law and Arts degree, and has received funding for a summer internship in Shanghai.</p>
<p>“The programme provides Mandarin lessons and courses on Chinese business culture and values which I am really looking forward to, says Raagini. “China is one of the fastest growing markets and a key trading partner with NZ; this experience will aid in my goal to work in the international law field when I graduate.”</p>
<p>There are two rounds of scholarships awarded each year with a total $1.8 million available nationwide. The University of Auckland had the most scholarship recipients in the individual category this round and received the largest share of individual scholarship funding.</p>
<p>The students were awarded varying amounts towards tuition fees, flights and living costs, depending on their study requirements and destination.</p>
<p>Fourteen of the scholarship recipients are participating in exchange programmes, five will be undertaking language courses, two will be completing internships, two will be completing full masters programmes, and one will be undertaking a research project.</p>
<p>Scholarship applications are also open to groups. Earlier this year, a group of ten students from Development Studies (Faculty of Arts) was awarded $65,000 for a six-week programme to study Post-Disaster Recovery Processes and Disaster Risk Management in Indonesia and Thailand.</p>
<p>Applications are now open for the next round of PMSA scholarships (applications close 30 March 2016). For more information see the Education New Zealand website.</p>
