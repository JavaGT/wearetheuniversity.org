<p><strong>Jasmax appointed to design new Tauranga CBD tertiary campus</strong></p>
<p>The University of Waikato has appointed design firm Jasmax to design the Tauranga CBD campus it is developing for the region.</p>
<p>The university is leading the project on behalf of the Bay of Plenty Tertiary Education Partnership. The campus, in Durham St, Tauranga, is expected to be open by 2020.</p>
<p>Jasmax is one of New Zealand’s largest and longest-established architectural and design practices. With regional offices in Tauranga, Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, the design firm plans to bring its national expertise and local knowledge to the project, to produce a solution that has strong educational and community relevance for both the region, and the University.</p>
<p>Jasmax has significant experience in designing tertiary education buildings and masterplanning campuses, including delivering the multi-award winning AUT Sir Paul Reeves Building and the redeveloped Grafton Campus for the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato’s Senior Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor Alister Jones, says the company brings an enormous amount of experience and an integrated approach to the project.</p>
<p>“This tertiary campus is more than a learning space in the Bay of Plenty region – it’s a focal point for the community and a space that encourages people to come and see what the university and its partners are doing and how that impacts on their lives.”</p>

<p>Professor Jones says he is looking forward to collaborating with Jasmax, who will work alongside the external project managers Greenstone Group Ltd, and internal project management teams and a University design advisory group.</p>
<p>Jasmax Principal Neil Martin says the firm is proud to have been chosen to design the Tauranga CBD campus. “Jasmax is excited to contribute to the vibrancy of the Bay of Plenty, as it continues to grow. We look forward to working with the university, and the Bay of Plenty Tertiary Partnership, to enhance its offering and contribution to the region.”</p>
<p>Mr Martin says the firm already has plans to meet with some of the major stakeholders in the region before Christmas to start gathering their ideas for the design. Design concepts will be created in the coming months, with approval expected around October 2016. A year or so of detailed planning and consent work would follow, with construction expected to begin in early 2018.</p>
<p>The new campus will be designed to provide a high-tech university environment with flexible, innovative space for teaching and learning, and collaborations with local and regional industries and businesses. It will focus on programmes that relate to areas of regional activity, including marine, ICT and logistics. Further courses will be developed over time to support areas of economic and industry need in the Bay of Plenty.</p>
