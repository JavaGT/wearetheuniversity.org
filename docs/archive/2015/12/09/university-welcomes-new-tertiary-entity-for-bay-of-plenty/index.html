<p>University of Waikato welcomes new tertiary entity for Bay of Plenty</p>
<p>The University of Waikato has welcomed Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce’s announcement that a new tertiary entity will be created for the Bay of Plenty, following the disestablishment of Bay of Plenty Polytechnic and Waiariki Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>Mr Joyce announced today that a new polytechnic will be established in the Bay of Plenty in May 2016 to better serve the tertiary education needs of the region. He also signalled he was looking forward to seeing the University of Waikato’s long-standing and strong relationships with BOPP in delivering programmes extended into the Rotorua area.</p>
<p>University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley today welcomed the news. He says the University has worked extremely well with BOPP over many years and he is pleased this will be extended into Rotorua under the new institution.</p>
<p>“We have shown that the model of offering a comprehensive suite of jointly developed diploma and degree programmes, as well as research programmes, is hugely beneficial to the Bay of Plenty, and now the Rotorua community will also benefit.”</p>
<p>The Bay of Plenty has a current population of about 272,000 people; this is expected to reach more than 400,000 by 2051 and the highest growth will be in young Māori.</p>
<p>“We know that the region needs more people with bachelor degree qualifications or higher, as well as research and development, to support its own economic growth. The University has shown through its long-standing relationship with BOPP that it can address skills shortages by introducing programmes targeting the region’s needs, and so we are pleased that we will be able to extend this support into Rotorua.”</p>

<p>Professor Quigley says the Minister understands a new institution will improve access to high-quality tertiary education and imbue the skills the graduates of tomorrow need.</p>
<p>An establishment committee will be set up to manage the transition into the new institution.</p>
<p>Professor Quigley says the University of Waikato will work with the committee and then the new entity to ensure long-term and sustainable education outcomes for the wider Bay of Plenty region.</p>
