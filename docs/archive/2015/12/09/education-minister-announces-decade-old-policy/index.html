<p>Education Minister Announces Decade-Old Policy</p>
<p>Minister of Education Hekia Parata and Associate Minister of Transport Craig Foss announced today that students will now have the ability to gain NCEA credits while obtaining their driver licences, but this is nothing new, says New Zealand First</p>
<p>“It’s been the case in New Zealand schools for some time,” says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“The Ministers are completely out of touch with young people and schools. Gateway and STAR students can gain credits if they complete the programme through a driver education or training agency during school hours.</p>
<p>“The real barrier to young people gaining their driver’s licence is the exorbitant costs.</p>
<p>“The recommendation to complete 120 hours of practical driving can cost $60 an hour on average. This amounts to over $7000, which is impossible for many students.</p>
<p>“In Parliament today New Zealand First asked the Education Minister if she would fund an increase in the number of driving simulators at secondary schools to help address these costs. She said ‘no’, saying once again that schools can fund these initiatives from existing operation grants.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First would address the financial barriers contributing to the drop in licensed drivers rather than waste time on announcements about nothing.”</p>
