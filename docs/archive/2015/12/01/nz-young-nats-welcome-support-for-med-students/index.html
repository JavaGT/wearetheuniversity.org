<p><strong>Tuesday, 1 December 2015, 2:12 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Young_Nationals">New Zealand Young Nationals</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>NZ Young Nats Welcome Support for Med Students</strong></p>
<p>The Young Nats welcome the announcement by Hon Steven Joyce that the Government will extend the seven year cap on student loan borrowing to eight years for postgraduate medical students.</p>
<p>“We’ve backed the NZMSA’s campaign since May, because it just makes sense. Medical students need more time in full-time study to acquire the essential skills that our health system needs.” Young Nats President, Joel Rowan said.</p>
<p>“I’m pleased that the Minister has listened to the voice of students and recognised that this is a valuable investment. Medical students should be able to finish their degrees with the same support as students who get qualifications in other subjects.”</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s health system needs more doctors. The Young Nats warmly welcome the news that the Government is supporting the students who are working hard to qualify.”</p>
<p>“Student support should not be unlimited, nor should it come with no obligations, but the policy announced today makes access fairer for postgraduate med students.”</p>
<p>Previously, the cap would have left postgraduate medical students short by one or two years. Now, those students who take eight years to complete their study will be able to graduate without the need to self-fund their final year.</p>
