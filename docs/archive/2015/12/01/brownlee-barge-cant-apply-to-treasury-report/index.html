<p>Brownlee barge can’t apply to Treasury report</p>
<p>Gerry Brownlee can’t get away with his usual bluff and bluster in response to Treasury’s scathing critique of the Christchurch anchor projects, Labour Finance spokesperson Grant Robertson says.</p>
<p>“Mr Brownlee has a reputation for barging through any questions or criticisms. He’s trying to do that again today after Treasury put red ratings on the Canterbury anchor projects, meaning they may not be delivered successfully.</p>
<p>“It is remarkable that Mr Brownlee has questioned whether Treasury knows how much money is being spent in Christchurch. That’s what Treasury is for, and I would trust them on that score well ahead of the Minister.</p>
<p>“What Treasury is saying is what the people of Canterbury have known for some time. The National government is making a mess of the Canterbury rebuild and the delays are set to continue.</p>
<p>“Yesterday Bill English praised the report, but changed his tune this morning after his colleague threw his toys out of the cot. This is a mess.</p>
<p>“The delays and chaos around the anchor projects are holding back private investment and slowing down the recovery.</p>
<p>“What’s clear is the Government needs to get on top of the issues and fix them ASAP. That won’t happen while the minister refuses to acknowledge there’s a problem,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
