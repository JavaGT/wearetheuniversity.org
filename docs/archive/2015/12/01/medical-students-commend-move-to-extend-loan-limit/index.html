<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE – New Zealand Medical Students’ Association</strong></p>
<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Medical students commend Minister’s move to extend loan limit</strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand Medical Students’ Association (NZMSA) welcomes the Minster of Tertiary Education Steven Joyce’s announcement of a student loan extension for post-graduate medical students but warns it still leaves some medical students without government assistance.</p>
<p>The student loan changes allow graduate entry medical students to apply for an extra 1 EFTS of student loan as well as being able to access the Trainee Intern Grant as a lump sum in their final year of study, rather than as a monthly payment. This will allow the majority of graduate-entry medical students to complete their studies.</p>
<p>NZMSA President Mike Fleete welcomes the Minister’s policy change as a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>“NZMSA has been lobbying Minister Joyce for a number of years now and many people on NZMSA are to thank for this. We commend Minister Joyce on taking a step in the right direction and we are very thankful for this.”</p>
<p>However, the policy still leaves those who studied longer degrees, done prior research or completed bridging courses without government assistance for the duration of their medical study.</p>
<p>“Students who have carried out research prior to entering medicine represent some of the most able students who can contribute to advancing medical science. It would be a tragedy to lose their talent simply because they could not get a student loan.”</p>
<p>The NZMSA calls on the Minister to continue his policy revision to ensure no medical students are left without student loan support so they can finish their medical qualifications and become the doctors New Zealander needs.</p>
