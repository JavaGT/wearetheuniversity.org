<p>Back-down has Joyce doctoring loan policy</p>
<p>The Government has been embarrassed into a back-down over its short-sighted and unfair student loan cap, Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.</p>
<p>“Steven Joyce appears to have had a road to Damascus rethink on the detrimental effects his seven year study cap on student loans has had on post-grads, and pushed it out another year.</p>
<p>“I am delighted for the students.</p>
<p>“However it comes on the same day I received a 21,000 signature petition from medical students urging the Government to lift the restriction, and just a few months after he told me he was not considering any exemptions.</p>
<p>“He went on to say: The life-time limit encourages students to complete their qualification as quickly as possible in order to minimise the costs of tertiary study for both themselves and the Government. I consider that 7 EFTS is flexible enough to cover most students who do double degrees and the longest undergraduate courses.</p>
<p>“The cap, which prevents doctors, dentists and other professionals from specialising, has been in place since 2012. Mr Come-lately-Joyce has had more than sufficient time to initiate changes.</p>
<p>“He has been warned numerous times about the negative impact the policy would have on students whose future careers require extended study periods and withheld advice he’s received on it.</p>
<p>“An extra year is a sop, and he knows it.</p>
<p>“This U-turn is nothing more than a bit of window-dressing by an under-pressure Steven Joyce to tweak a policy he was adamant didn’t need tweaking.</p>
<p>“Labour is working on a policy that will redress this issue for many more students,” Annette King says.</p>
