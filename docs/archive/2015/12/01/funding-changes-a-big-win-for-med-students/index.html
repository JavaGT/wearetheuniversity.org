<p>Funding changes a big win for med students</p>
<p>December 1, 2015. 1:05pm</p>
<p>ACT Leader David Seymour says the Government’s move to give medical students a longer period of loan eligibility is a big win for medical students.</p>
<p>“The cap on funding at seven years of study is there to stop students using study as a holiday, however I know my friends at med school certainly aren’t having a holiday and they deserve to be supported throughout their study.&quot;</p>
<p>The original seven-year cap on student loans meant that many medical students, who often have previous degrees, would have their funding cut off before the end of their studies.</p>
<p>“The status quo said you could take seven years to do an arts degree but you couldn’t take eight to do a med degree. Tertiary policy needs to take into account differences in degree length and the value different degrees provide to taxpayers. It’s a relief to see the government valuing medical students.</p>
<p>“The Medical Students Association President Mike Fleete, as well as his recent predecessor, Elizabeth Berryman, deserve congratulations for their leadership. Their campaign inspired me to bring the issue up on Back Benches in June so it’s a relief to finally see action.</p>
<p>“Also welcome is paying the trainee intern grant as a lump sum as it was unfair to expect medical students to receive their course funding fortnightly when fees were due at the beginning of the year.”</p>
