<p>Soaring Immigration Gives Way to Corrupt Employment  </p>
<p>New Zealand First says workplace corruption and exploitation of vulnerable workers will thrive unless the government stops the flood of migrants settling in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Record breaking immigration numbers have continued with a net gain of 63,700 migrants in the November 2015 year,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>“This comes as the Labour Inspectorate today confirmed widespread breaches of New Zealand labour standards, which could involve hundreds of employers throughout the country.</p>
<p>“The Labour Inspectorate cited an ‘inadequacy of record keeping’ by rogue employers. In other words, they’re talking about blatant fraud and this must be stopped.</p>
<p>“The proliferation of student visas, up more than 5,000 since last year, will only add fuel to the fire as rogue employers target migrant students desperate to stay here.</p>
<p>“It is clear that there must be more oversight of employers, more regular inspections and raids, stiffer penalties, and immigration at a level that can be controlled.</p>
<p>“Convicted employers, if new immigrants, should be sent home,” says Mr Peters.</p>
