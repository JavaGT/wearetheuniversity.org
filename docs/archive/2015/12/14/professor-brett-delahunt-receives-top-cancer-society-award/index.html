<p><strong>Professor Brett Delahunt receives top Cancer Society award</strong></p>
<p>Professor Brett Delahunt from the University of Otago, Wellington recently received the Meritorious Service Award from the Cancer Society of New Zealand in recognition of the many voluntary hours he has dedicated to fostering their goals in cancer research.</p>
<p>Professor Delahunt joined the National Scientific Advisory Committee of the Cancer Society of New Zealand in 1996 and became chair in 2001. The Cancer Society says he is regarded as one of the society’s most valued humanitarians, devoting on average more than 100 hours of voluntary service each year.</p>
<p>“Brett’s commitment and devoted contribution are immensely valuable to cancer research and we can’t thank him enough,” says the Cancer Society’s National President, Peter Hutchison.</p>
<p>“We’re recognising his long-standing voluntary service and leadership spanning 20 years and we’re thrilled to have him on board for another two years.”</p>
<p>Professor Delahunt says he’s very happy to accept the honour but would like to acknowledge the whole team.</p>
<p>“The huge strides in cancer research could not be done without the whole team. I credit all the individuals of the National Scientific Advisory Committee for their work and contribution. “You get to really understand the huge commitment amongst the scientific community in New Zealand in cancer research. Many great projects have been funded through the Cancer Society and have gone on to better things,” he says.</p>
