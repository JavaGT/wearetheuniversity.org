<p><strong>NZ Wars petition adds weight to the call for a national day of remembrance</strong></p>
<p><strong>7 December 2015</strong></p>
<p>The Māori Party welcomes the petition to Parliament calling for a national day of remembrance for the New Zealand Wars. Ōtorohanga College students gathered more than 11,000 signatures in support of a New Zealand Wars Day and have travelled from Waikato to Wellington to present it.</p>
<p>“These rangatahi have shown the kind of leadership this country needs. We are all better off for having a stronger understanding of our history, good and bad,” says Māori Party Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell.</p>
<p>“The students, school community and whānau involved in this petition should be extremely proud of what they’ve achieved.”</p>
<p>The Māori Party has been a strong political advocate for commemorating the New Zealand land wars which began in the 1840s and mainly throughout the North Island during the 19th century.</p>
<p>Māori Party Co-leader Marama Fox says “these battles have shaped us as much as the wars our soldiers fought in distant lands.”</p>
<p>“Many people may not know about the military campaigns of Ōrākau in Waikato, Te Tarata in Ōpōtiki or the siege of Waeranga a Hika near Gisborne but they have left an indelible mark on our whenua and people.”</p>
<p>She says the petition presented to Parliament today adds weight to their negotiations with the Government to recognise days of great historical importance to Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
