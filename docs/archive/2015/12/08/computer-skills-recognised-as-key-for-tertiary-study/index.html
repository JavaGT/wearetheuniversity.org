<p>08 December 2015</p>
<p>Success at NCEA level in a new computing related achievement standard now counts towards admission to the University of Auckland and is endorsed for study across the University, it was announced today.</p>
<p>Up to now, NCEA Level 3 credits in Digital Technologies have not been included on the list of subjects considered best preparation for study at university level, particularly in science and engineering. </p>
<p>Dean of Science Professor John Hosking says today’s decision acknowledging digital skills and knowledge as increasingly important across a wide range of study areas marks an important change for students, parents and schools.</p>
<p>It sent a clear signal to schools on what the University considers the most suitable preparatory subjects for admission to many Bachelor programmes, he says.</p>
<p>“Literacy in computer technologies and a fluent understanding of the digital world not only provides a strong foundation for tertiary study but the University recognises that it has become a core employable skill.</p>
<p>“I welcome the addition of Digital Technologies to the list of subjects we believe are of prime academic importance for success at tertiary level.”</p>
<p>The addition of NCEA Digital Technologies has been welcomed by the IT industry.</p>
<p>“This is a very significant step towards transforming Digital Technologies into a strong academic area with the potential to attract top students into related areas,” says Institute of Information Technology Professionals CEO Paul Matthews.</p>
<p>“It’s also a critical step in addressing high-level shortages within the industry and signally the importance of tertiary study in this field.”</p>
<p>Recent changes in the computing curriculum for NCEA, in consultation with universities, has resulted in a revised curriculum for Digital Technologies. The new curriculum progresses from Level 1 studies to Level 3. Level 3 NCEA Digital Technologies includes database creation and management and an introduction to networking and programming skills</p>
<p>The University’s Department of Computer Science has a new Stage 1 course which builds on the Digital Technologies curriculum and allows students entry to an accelerate pathway if they have completed NCEA level 3 in the subject.</p>
<p>“The Faculty of Science will be strongly recommending Digital Technologies for all science students,” Professor Hosking says.</p>
