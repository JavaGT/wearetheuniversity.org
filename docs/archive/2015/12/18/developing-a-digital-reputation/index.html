<p>Developing a digital reputation  </p>
<p>A Victoria University of Wellington researcher is developing a new reputation management system for the digital world.</p>
<p>Ferry Hendrikx, who graduated last week with a PhD in computer science, is researching ways of building reputation profiles online that draw information from multiple sources.</p>
<p>Ferry Hendrikx“The widespread use of the internet for social and commercial use has made traditional methods of gathering reputation, such as word-of-mouth or personal associations, insufficient for gaining a clear picture of an individual or organisation,” says Ferry.</p>
<p>“Many websites have features designed to build trust, but these only provide a narrow perspective of an individual. They don’t allow for a fuller, more substantial impression. Someone might be an honest trader on Trade Me, but a poor mechanic. A company might give generously to charities, but be a bad employer.”</p>
<p>Ferry’s thesis proposes a network-based framework that automatically extracts information about an individual or organisation from multiple sites and stores this information in a profile. The system decides what’s important, reliable or relevant based on online activity.</p>
<p>The reputation associated with a profile will develop and change over time as new information comes to hand and old data becomes less significant.</p>
<p>“The profile develops as a result of online actions and associations. While the individual or organisation can host their own profile, it’s not something they can necessarily modify—you can’t lie about yourself,” says Ferry.</p>

<p>“A key aspect of the research is the establishment of an access control feature, meaning that, as a reputation develops, the individual or organisation will gain (or lose) access to relevant online services or groups. They’re not required to apply for these things—it just happens.</p>
<p>“Examples might be access to industry relevant publications, a wider database of customers to trade with, or membership to online societies.”</p>
<p>The technology is still at a nascent stage, however Ferry believes this approach has significant potential for reputation management as social and commercial activity continues to grow and develop in the online space.</p>
