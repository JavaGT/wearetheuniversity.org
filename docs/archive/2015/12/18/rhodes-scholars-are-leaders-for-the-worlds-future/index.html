<p>Rhodes scholars are leaders for the world’s future</p>
<p>18 December 2015</p>
<p>Rhodes scholarships have been awarded to three young graduates with outstanding intellect, character, leadership, and commitment to service, to carry out post graduate study at the prestigious University of Oxford, UK.</p>
<p>The 2016 Rhodes scholars elect are Jade Leung, Kimberley Savill and Oscar Lyons. The announcement follows a selection meeting chaired by former Governor-General The Rt Hon Sir Anand Satyanand at Government House in Wellington.</p>
<p>Sir Anand Satyanand said, “The Rhodes Scholarship will be a transformative opportunity for these outstanding young people who all share a passion to contribute to the world.</p>
<p>“Rhodes&#39;s vision over one hundred years ago was to develop outstanding leaders with the commitment to make a positive difference, the potential to become leaders for the world’s future, and the desire to promote international peace and understanding and peace. In fact all those shortlisted very ably met his criteria.”</p>
<p>Jade Leung, aged 22 of Howick in Auckland, was the 2011 Dux of St Cuthbert’s College and received the Prime Minister’s Award for Academic Excellence. Jade has completed a Bachelor of Engineering with First Class Honours in environmental engineering, in just three years at the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>At Oxford she will pursue a Doctorate (DPhil) with the School of Geography and the Environment to study the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus, which she describes as “non-negotiable necessities for human development”. She will look at how policy decisions could be better designed to take into account the interdependencies between human development, the economy and our environment.</p>

<p>Jade is also active in social enterprise initiatives to achieve change. She was the Learning and Change Manager at Engineers Without Borders NZ; CEO of the P3 Foundation against poverty; and is the CEO of the Learning Collaborative to equip secondary students with the skills to succeed academically. She is a founding trustee for NCEA campus – a not-for-profit organisation that encourages able university students to provide tutoring to secondary school students, especially those in low-decile communities, to help them reach their full academic potential.</p>
<p>Kimberley Savill, aged 22, was Dux at Nelson’s Nayland College and awarded the NZQA Outstanding Scholar award in 2011.</p>
<p>Kimberley is studying at Victoria University of Wellington where she has completed a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and Mathematics and is currently studying towards an Honours degree in Chemistry. She has been awarded the Victoria Excellence Scholarship and received New Zealand Institute of Chemistry prizes at each level of her study.</p>
<p>At Oxford Kimberley will study for a Doctorate (DPhil) in Physical and Theoretical Chemistry. She says the urge to contribute and give something back shapes what she does. Kimberley wants to make a difference through science research and in particular chemistry, to address immediate and important challenges especially concerning renewable energy and storage technologies.</p>
<p>She is skilled at debating, and was a member of the VUW debating team which participated in the World Universities Debating Championships in Malaysia earlier this year. She is President of the University Debating Society and convenes an annual competition for secondary students across the Kahurangi-Marlborough region.</p>

<p>Oscar Lyons, aged 25, attended Rosmini College at Takapuna, in Auckland where he was Senior Dux. He also achieved the top placing in New Zealand in the ICAS (International Competitions and Assessment for Schools) for Science and won a University of Auckland Scholarship.</p>
<p>He finished his medical training (MBChB) at the University of Auckland last year before working as a Doctor at Gisborne Hospital. He has just become the Medical Education Fellow in Surgery at the South Auckland Clinical School of the University of Auckland. He will be closely involved in the teaching, assessment and pastoral care for medical students at Middlemore Hospital.</p>
<p>Oscar plans to complete a Masters of Science in Higher Education at Oxford, and then progress to a doctorate in medical education. His goal is to evaluate, design and implement changes to improve mental health and medical education in medical students and those they serve.</p>
<p>Oscar has a lifelong passion for teaching and tutored younger students at secondary school and continued as a Teaching Assistant and Lead Instructor at university. He was also voted Peer Leader at Medical School.</p>
<p>He is active in supporting Auckland Rotary District’s Young Leadership Award annual camp designed to improve leadership potential. His other interests include judo and musical performance.</p>
<p>Rhodes is an international scholarship with a global view. Each year 89 scholars are selected from 32 different countries who become part of the wider Rhodes scholarship community while at university and throughout their lives.</p>
<p>The Scholarship covers the students’ fees, accommodation and living costs for up to three years at Oxford, which is one of the oldest and top-ranked universities in the world.</p>
<p>In New Zealand the application and selection process for the Rhodes Scholarships is managed by Universities New Zealand (formerly called the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’ Committee). Universities New Zealand - Te Pōkai Tara manages over 40 scholarships worth over $2Million.</p>
