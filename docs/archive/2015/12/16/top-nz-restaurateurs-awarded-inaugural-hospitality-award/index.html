<p>Top NZ restaurateurs awarded inaugural hospitality award</p>
<p>Two of New Zealand’s top chefs and restaurateurs have been recognised at Auckland University of Technology’s annual hospitality awards.</p>
<p>Simon Gault and Judith Tabron have been honoured for their “Outstanding contribution to the hospitality and tourism community”.</p>
<p>AUT’s School of Hospitality and Tourism holds an awards event every year to acknowledge its top students but this is the first time it has recognised industry achievements.</p>
<p>“The award recognises outstanding performance over a sustained period,” says AUT Senior Lecturer in Hospitality, Lindsay Neill. “It is recognition of a contribution to raising the standard of hospitality in New Zealand and to increasing awareness of New Zealand as a cuisine destination.”</p>
<p>“Over the years Judith has gone from strength to strength with a string of successful restaurants and a lineage of chefs and front of house staff that have enriched Auckland&#39;s - and consequently New Zealand&#39;s - hospitality scene. Judith&#39;s success has come about because of two key factors - her own huge talent and her determination not to settle for &#39;near enough&#39; … her innovative cuisine has really set the standard in contemporary New Zealand cuisine,” says Neill.</p>
<p>“Simon Gault has blazed a path through hospitality bringing new and exciting foods to New Zealand palates. For taste, creativity and the layering of flavours, food colours and textures Simon is a master,” says Neill. “Never satisfied, but in the best way possible, Simon is always on the creative look-out, introducing many to molecular gastronomy and its technologies, food and nutrition innovation and now product development – he is one of hospitality’s creative entrepreneurs.”</p>

<p>Both Gault and Tabron are alumni of the School of Hospitality and Tourism.</p>
<p>AUT Head of Department Hospitality David Williamson says the awards are an important recognition of outstanding achievement by the school’s top students and the new industry awards ‘close the circle’.</p>
<p>“Now, by adding the industry awards, the event is celebrating both the excellence of the young graduates, just starting their careers, and the achievements of the &#39;legends&#39;, who have graduated in the past. This way both the future and the legacy of the school is celebrated and recognised.”</p>
<p>Neill says the awards are also a celebration of the “coming of age of hospitality in New Zealand”.</p>
<p>“These successful people exemplify a gateway into an exciting, challenging and rewarding career option and they offer a great example to inspire and motivate young professionals joining our industry. Like the university itself, our award winners have much to teach us all.”</p>
<p>The awards were held at the Sir Paul Reeves Building at the Auckland University of Technology’s City Campus.</p>
