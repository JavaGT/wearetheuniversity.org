<p>Back Down on Student Loans a Victory for Common Sense</p>
<p>New Zealand First is calling for Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce to apologise to hundreds of medical students for causing them stress and financial hardship.</p>
<p>“For five years the Minister has claimed that seven years of a student loan is enough for a medical degree, which usually takes nine years of study,” says Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.</p>
<p>“He’s maintained that the government’s limit on access to the loan beyond seven years ‘isn’t a problem’.</p>
<p>“But now he has had a light bulb moment. As a consequence he’s backed down. It’s time to apologise.</p>
<p>“We’ve taken every opportunity to question the government about consequences of the cap in select committees and parliamentary debates,” says Mrs Martin.</p>
<p>Health Spokesperson Barbara Stewart says the cap affected about a third of medical students.</p>
<p>“The Minister once absurdly told students to get a bank loan or borrow elsewhere.</p>
<p>“There is a critical shortage of New Zealand-trained doctors and this policy has intensified the shortage.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First has been vocal in its support for student medical associations and their opposition to the cap,” says Mrs Stewart.</p>
<p>“New Zealand First joins with students to celebrate Minister Joyce’s backdown as it represents a victory for students, and for common sense,” the MPs say.</p>
