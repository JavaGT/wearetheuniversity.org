<p>Unfinished Canterbury claims used for surplus</p>
<p>EQC has admitted it didn’t know its full Canterbury claims liability at the same time it was reducing the Government’s ultimate liability to let Bill English scrape together a surplus, says Labour Finance spokesperson Grant Robertson.</p>
<p>“At the Finance and Expenditure Committee this morning the Earthquake Commission acknowledged that at the end of the last financial year they had yet to finalise a policy for loss of value claims related to increased liquefaction vulnerability nor did they know the number of properties affected by increased flooding vulnerability.</p>
<p>“Given this uncertainty and lack of policy it defies belief that they could be confident at that time to reduce the Government&#39;s ultimate liability for claims by $455 million.</p>
<p>“There were still 22,000 land claims to settle at that point, with a high level of uncertainty as to the cost of the claims.</p>
<p>“Cantabrians will be shocked the claims liability was slashed to politically manufacture the Government’s wafer thin surplus.</p>
<p>“It&#39;s no wonder Bill English is furiously backing away from any pretence his government can achieve more than a one-off surplus.</p>
<p>“National made reaching surplus in 2014/15 its political goal, but it was nothing more than that. Bill English never had a plan to create a sustainable surplus and built his one-off on nothing more than smoke and mirrors,” Grant Robertson said.</p>
