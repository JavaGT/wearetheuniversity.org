<p>Minister a No-Hoper on Housing  </p>
<p>Dr Nick Smith is a no-hoper as a Housing Minister, says New Zealand First.</p>
<p>“He has let down tens of thousands of Kiwis who want a home. He proved it himself in Parliament today,” says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Housing Denis O’Rourke.</p>
<p>“The Minister thought increasing housing consents by four times since National became the government in 2008 was something to boast about.</p>
<p>“But it is nothing to be proud of. Immigration under National has increased 12 times since 2008. So, housing consents should have increased by 12 times just to keep up with the needs of people immigrating to New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The government is wasting its time talking about consents. No-one can live in a consent. It is built houses that matter,” says Mr O’Rourke.</p>
