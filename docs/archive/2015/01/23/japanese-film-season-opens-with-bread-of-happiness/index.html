<p><strong>Friday, 23 January 2015, 12:44 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University">Massey University</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Friday, January 23, 2015</strong><br><strong>Japanese film season opens with <em>Bread of Happiness</em></strong></p>
<p>As summer holidays give way to normal daily work and school routines, the monthly Japanese film screenings return to Massey University’s Auckland campus.</p>
<p>The free films are brought to New Zealand with the kind permission of The Japan Foundation and the Consulate-General of Japan, and screen on the first Monday of each month.</p>
<p>The heart-warming drama <em>Bread of Happiness</em> (2012) – or <em>Shiawase no Pan</em> - will open the 2015 Japanese film series, screening in the Atrium Round Room on February 2.</p>
<p>Auckland campus registrar Andrea Davies says the movies are a fantastic way for the local community to enjoy Massey’s campus.</p>
<p>“We have had a great response from the community when we started screening these films last year. It is a fantastic way for people to check out the campus – and with students living on campus this year in our brand new accommodation, I’m sure they will enjoy this as well.”</p>
<p>Written and directed by Yukiko Mishima, the season-opening film was inspired by a real bakery café in Hokkaido. The film depicts the everyday life of the couple who run it, and their customers, filled with baking and also shows Hokkaido’s amazing scenery over the four seasons of the year.</p>
<p>Rie and Sang start a bakery-cum-restaurant named Mani on the shores of Lake Toya in Hokkaido. Sang is the baker and Rie is the chef who prepares the food in the restaurant. The business serves a variety of customers – some of whom are experiencing personal problems. However, as they leave, they feel happy and relaxed.</p>

<p>The film stars Tomoyo Harada as Rie and Yo Oizumi as Sang.</p>
<p>Preceding the main feature is a short 15-minute documentary on life and culture in Japan, which starts at 6.15 pm. No bookings are required to attend the films, and people are welcome to bring their own food.</p>
<p>The films are also shown at the University of Waikato on the second or third Thursday of the month, and at the University of Auckland on the last Thursday of the month.</p>
<p>The March 2 screening will feature the classic 1987 film <em>Hatchi Monogatari,</em> directed by Seijiro Koyama. This screening will return to the era of old-time cinema, as the film will be projected using 16 mm film stock.</p>
