<p><strong>National’s state house sell-off will drive up all rents</strong></p>
<p>National’s plan to sell-off state houses and subsidise landlords will drive up rents for all renters, says Labour Leader Andrew Little.</p>
<p>“John Key’s announcement of 3000 additional income-related subsidises and the sale of up to 8000 state homes signals the Government is getting out of state housing and setting up a windfall for property developers.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister is sending thousands of state housing tenants out into the private rental market with a taxpayer-funded subsidy in their pockets. This will just push rents up for all renters.</p>
<p>“This is a lose-lose. State housing tenants lose the security of dedicated social housing. They will now be competing with the million other Kiwis battling it out in the already overheated private rental market.</p>
<p>“The Government will end up shelling out more and more in subsidies to landlords.</p>
<p>“Because National refuses to build more houses, throwing subsidies at the housing shortage will make housing more unaffordable.</p>
<p>“National is trying to sugar coat its state house sell-off by talking about selling homes to the Salvation Army and other community groups. But John Key has admitted the Government will sell to landlords and property developers.</p>
<p>“This will be a massive transfer of resources from the taxpayer to landlords; which is exactly what happened in the United Kingdom when state housing was sold off and replaced with a voucher system.</p>
<p>“John Key is someone who should understand the importance of stable state housing to give even the poorest Kiwi kids a decent start in life. He got that benefit but now he is going to deny today’s state house kids that opportunity because of ideology,” Andrew Little says.</p>
