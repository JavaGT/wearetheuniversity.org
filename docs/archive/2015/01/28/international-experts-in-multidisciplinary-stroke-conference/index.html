<p><strong>International experts and clinicians taking part in multidisciplinary stroke conference</strong></p>
<p>January 28, 2015</p>
<p>Experts, engineers, physiologists, clinicians, medical academics and students from around the world will discuss the impact of new technology on helping recovering patients at an international stroke rehabilitation conference in Christchurch in May.</p>
<p>Keynote speakers from the United States, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand will talk about neuroscience and neural recovery, clinical research and commercialisation.</p>
<p>The May 10 to 12 conference is being hosted by the University of Canterbury Rose Centre for Stroke Recovery and Research at St. George’s Medical Centre.</p>
<p>Centre director Associate Professor Maggie-Lee Huckabee is one of five keynote speakers and she will raise issues impacting on stroke victims.</p>
<p>“Stroke is the second most common cause of death worldwide and a common cause of disability in adults in developed countries. Stroke is largely preventable, yet about 9000 New Zealanders every year have a stroke. Every day about 24 New Zealanders have a stroke and only half of these are able to return to full time work after six months,” Associate Professor Huckabee says.</p>
<p>“There are an estimated 60,000 stroke survivors in New Zealand. Many are disabled and need significant daily support. However, stroke recovery can continue throughout life.</p>
<p>“Health systems have developed comprehensive clinical rehabilitation services for people in acute and post-acute phases. Services are particularly well developed for elderly stroke patients. There are also well developed services for young patients who have suffered disability due to accidental injury.</p>

<p>“It’s exciting that our University of Canterbury Rose Centre for Stroke Recovery and Research will celebrate our inaugural year with an international stroke rehabilitation conference.</p>
<p>“This conference is the only of its kind in New Zealand to target stroke rehabilitation specialists with a focus on applied biotechnology.”</p>
<p>Associate Professor Maggie-Lee Huckabee’s work, combined with the efforts of clinicians in the district health board, has improved patient outcomes and reduced health care costs by more than $1 million and has supported a collaborative culture of research support for frontline clinicians.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Huckabee has co-authored two textbooks on swallowing impairment following neurological impairment, 10 book chapters on topics related to rehabilitation and 51 peer-reviewed scientific articles in various dimensions of dysphagia.
