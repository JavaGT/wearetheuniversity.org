<p><strong>Canterbury graduate hopes to improve research in NZ</strong></p>
<p>January 28, 2015</p>
<p>A University of Canterbury graduate has developed a website designed to connect New Zealand university postgraduate students with participants for their research.</p>
<p>The creator of the website Subjects Wanted Sam Jarman hopes the website will increase the number of participants involve d in research projects, leading to more reliable and statistically sound results.</p>
<p>As well as visiting the website, prospective participants can view current research listings on the Subjects Wanted Facebook page.</p>
<p>Jarman says the website helps to inform people of the amazing research taking place on university campuses across New Zealand. By listing research experiments on the website, the researcher&#39;s discipline is promoted, as well as postgraduate study. By improving the quality of research, Subjects Wanted will also help improve the global rankings of New Zealand universities.</p>
<p>&quot;There are experiments ranging from rock climbing, to eating kiwifruit for a week, to having tubes up your nose. Subjects Wanted helps undergrads learn about what postgrads do,&quot; Jarman says.</p>
<p>&quot;Researchers don&#39;t get the participants they need and therefore don&#39;t end up getting published. This website will create better research and it will promote and enhance postgraduate study. Hopefully Subjects Wanted changes the face of research in New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>University of Canterbury researchers are currently investigating more than 800 PhD research projects, creating a huge demand for participants.</p>

<p>Jarman completed a Bachelor of Science with Honours in Computer Science at the University of Canterbury last year. He was inspired to build the website after his friend was unable to find a sufficient number of participants for his research.</p>
<p>Each research listing has unique conditions to fit the researcher&#39;s criteria - such as age and gender restrictions. Anyone that fits the criteria can participate - not just university students. The website has had 39 listings and over 12,000 views so far. In the near future Jarman hopes to add a booking system as well as enabling researchers to have more control over their own listings.</p>
<p>Jarman works as a mobile software developer for Carnival Mobile in Wellington. He also has a YouTube channel called Nested which features computer science tutorials for high school students.</p>
