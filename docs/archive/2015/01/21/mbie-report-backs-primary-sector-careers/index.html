<p><em>- for immediate release</em></p>
<p><strong>MBIE report backs primary sector careers</strong></p>
<p>Lincoln University’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor Business Development, Jeremy Baker, has welcomed the findings of a Ministry of Business, Innovation &amp; Employment (MBIE) report which shows particularly favourable prospects for those exploring primary sector and associated land-based careers.</p>
<p>The <em>Occupation Outlook 2015</em> report is a comprehensive industry document designed to provide key information for those contemplating study and career options. The report rated the job prospects for agricultural scientists as very high, and projected an annual growth for the profession of 4 percent for 2013-18 and 3.2 percent for 2018-23.</p>
<p>Identical figures are listed for environmental scientists and food technicians, while the job prospects for farmers and farm managers is also rated as very high.</p>
<p>“The report lends weight to the message Lincoln University has been making for some time. Namely, that there are many exciting career opportunities in the primary sector for those who are prepared to open themselves up to the possibilities,” says Jeremy Baker.</p>
<p>“A key ‘take home’ from the report is that the sector is becoming increasingly sophisticated. While this means a greater need for highly trained individuals in agribusiness and science- related fields, it also opens up a range of opportunities in areas such as IT and manufacturing, as well as in the provision of financial and accounting services.”</p>

<p>The Government is increasingly targeting more highly skilled occupations within the primary industries in an attempt to improve outcomes across value chains and meet its 2025 target of doubling primary exports.</p>
<p>Jeremy Baker sees this as particularly important in light of last year’s Ministry of Education report which stated that only 1.1 percent of current university students are studying an agriculture-based discipline.</p>
<p>When including manufacturing associated with the land-based industries and other related services, the primary sector employs approximately 350,000 people nationwide, accounting for around one in six employees. According to the <em>Occupation Outlook 2015</em> report, it’s expected the country will need an additional 92,600 qualified workers in the sector by 2025 in order to meet industry goals.</p>
<p>“One thing is certain if we are to ensure we can meet the necessary target of graduates entering the sector, and that’s the need to engage and inform urban students as to the opportunities within the industry as a whole. There are pathways and specialisations that extend well beyond the farm itself. We need career professionals to fly the primary sector flag.</p>
<p>“My advice to any student considering their options is to think beyond the usual pathways. If you have an interest in biology or chemistry, why not apply that to something like plant science, animal science or bioprotection, for instance? If you’re thinking of studying business, maybe consider something like food marketing or supply chain management?” says Jeremy Baker.</p>
