<p><strong>South Auckland residents have health concerns about living close to the motorway</strong><br><strong>January 25, 2015</strong></p>
<p>Many South Auckland residents have expressed concern regarding the long-term health implications of living close to New Zealand’s busiest motorway, University of Canterbury researchers have found.</p>
<p>Dr Woodrow Pattinson and Professor Simon Kingham looked at air quality across two South Auckland communities bisected by motorways which carry up to 122,000 vehicles a day.</p>
<p>They data included concentrations of ultrafine particles, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and particulate matter all of which are emitted from vehicles and can adversely impact on people’s health.</p>
<p>Dr Pattinson says residents were included in the research to discuss their perceptions of air quality issues and how they felt about living near New Zealand&#39;s busiest roads.</p>
<p>“A number of people were worried about children and family members suffering long-term illnesses because of the polluted air around them. Asthma and allergies were the most common complaints, with some residents feeling the motorway was the primary cause of their child developing asthma.</p>
<p>“Residents felt that the smell of smoke and fumes, road dust and non-exhaust emissions as well as road noise inhibited their ability to enjoy their leisure time outside.</p>
<p>“We found that motorists and unemployed or retired people were prone to higher long-term exposure levels due to spending time in traffic and having more free time to spend outdoors at home.</p>

<p>“The link between long-term exposure and respiratory issues is well-established. However, there are probable links to a number of more serious health effects which are still not fully understood.</p>
<p>“We need to take a cautionary approach and actively seek to reduce exposure levels, especially in the home environment where people spend a significant portion of their time. In many large cities, a substantial number of homes are situated on land immediately adjacent to busy motorways and other busy roads.”</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury results add to the international literature which is working to reduce residential exposures in high density traffic areas.</p>
<p>The research lends additional rationale to having a separation buffer of at least 100 metres from major roads, especially for sensitive population groups such as retirement villages, social housing projects and schools and childcare centres. The research received support and funding from the New Zealand Transport Agency, the University of Canterbury Geography Department, the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research and Auckland University.</p>
