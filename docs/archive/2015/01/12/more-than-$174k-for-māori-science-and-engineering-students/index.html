<p><strong>More than $174K in scholarships for Māori science and engineering students</strong></p>
<p>In 2014, more than $174,000 in scholarships was awarded to Māori Science and Engineering students from the University of Waikato.</p>

<p>The scholarships came from a variety of supporters, including Waikato University, private trusts, iwi and leading New Zealand companies.</p>
<p>“I’m extremely proud to be associated with all of the students within the faculty. The fact that our future scientists and engineers are being recognised for their hard work is awesome. This just goes to show that determination and a clear direction can be academically and financially rewarding. As a result I know that the families are incredibly proud of the achievements of these students and look forward to even greater things in the future,” says Kevin Eastwood, Science &amp; Engineering Māori Student Achievement Coordinator at the University of Waikato.</p>
