<p><strong>New Zealand under-20 rugby squad member still focusing on Canterbury engineering studies</strong></p>
<p><strong>January 19, 2015</strong></p>
<p>Sam Godwin, a scholarship winner and member of the New Zealand under-20 rugby squad preparing the 2015 Junior World championships in Italy later this year, is continuing his University of Canterbury engineering studies despite a heavy rugby workload this year.</p>
<p>Godwin was a loose forward of the University’s Division One championship team last year and captain of the Canterbury Under-19 side which reached the national final. He was selected into the New Zealand Junior squad for the world championships and has already attending a training camp.</p>
<p>He is a member of the Canterbury rugby academy and is aiming for a place in the Crusaders Knights squad which will play a number of Super rugby B games before the New Zealand team is announced for the world championships.</p>
<p>Brought up in Gisborne and as a Lindisfarne College student, he was previously named in the New Zealand under-17 tournament team and was a selected for the Hurricanes secondary schools camp.</p>
<p>Godwin could follow in the footstep of another current University of Canterbury student, All Black loose forward Kieran Read, who is doing a sports coaching degree.</p>
<p>“I’ll do everything I can to do my best this year and with that in mind I hope to have the flexibility to do just a couple of engineering papers this year. The University of Canterbury has been great in helping me fit my rugby around my studies,” Godwin says.</p>

<p>“I have been working over summer for land development company Davie Lovell-Smith towards the working 800 hours requirement of an engineering degree.”</p>
<p>Canterbury ITM head coach and New Zealand Under-20s coach former All Black Scott Robertson says Godwin has a great work ethic and is an “extremely focused young man”.</p>
<p>Godwin is a recent recipient of the Eastland Group’s Tertiary Study Scholarships which have a particular focus on civil, mechanical or electrical engineering. The scholarship allowed him to train in Christchurch over the summer holidays rather than seek part time work.</p>
<p>“Academic studies continue to be a priority over my rugby so I am pleased the Canterbury Rugby Football Union is also encouraging me to continue with my studies,” Godwin says.</p>
<p>Senior civil and natural rescources engineering lecturer Dr Pedro Lee says Godwin is an absolute pleasure to have in class and he has done well in his studies last year.</p>
<p>“Sam is clearly very capable and is able to juggle his engineering studies with training in his chosen sport. The department will continue to work with Sam allow him to excel academically while pursuing his sporting goals,” Dr Lee says.</p>
<p>Godwin is one of thousands of students applying to enrol at the University in 2015. The university has seen a surge in new international students applying in engineering and business. These applications contribute to an overall 15 percent lift in new international student applications. Domestic applications are in line with last year and 2015 forecasts.</p>
<p>The university will know the number of students enrolled to study in 2015 by early March. Any students considering enrolling at the University of Canterbury this year can call 0800 VARSITY (827 748) with any query.</p>
