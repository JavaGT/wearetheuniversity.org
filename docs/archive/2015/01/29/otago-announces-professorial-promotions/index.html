He has research relationships with multinational dental companies in South Africa, USA, Switzerland, Sweden, Korea, Germany and Australia. His emerging secondary research area involves forensic research and victim identification.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Frampton<br>Department of Medicine, University of Otago, Christchurch</strong><br>Chris Frampton’s primary research focus is the statistical conduct and analysis leading to publication of phase III randomised clinical trials, with a particular focus on cardiology, anaesthesiology, oncology and psychology trials. In this role, he provides statistical design and analysis input into trial protocol development, is involved in data safety monitoring meetings as the trial is undertaken and then analyses the data and contributes to the research publications from the trial. Currently there are approximately 25 national and international trials that he is directly involved with. He is a member of three of the national medical regulatory committees (SCOTT, MARC and MAAC) and provides statistical oversight and analysis for three Australasian medical registries – The NZ Joint registry, the NZ Cystic Fibrosis registry, and the Pulmonary Hypertension Society ANZ registry.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Gearry<br>Department of Medicine, University of Otago, Christchurch</strong><br>In addition to his academic role, Richard Gearry is a Consultant Gastroenterologist at Christchurch Hospital. His research interests centre on luminal gastroenterology, specifically inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome, and broad aspects of nutrition. His work has included landmark epidemiological and clinical studies of IBD in New Zealand and collaboration on international IBD genetics projects. Current research interests include the gut microbiota and its role in health and disease with specific reference to nutritional modulation. He has a number of advisory roles including being Medical Director of the New Zealand Nutrition Foundation, Medical Advisor to Crohn’s and Colitis New Zealand, a Trustee of the Bowel and Liver Trust, Board member of the National Intestinal Failure Service Clinical Governance Board and is one of 60 worldwide members of the International Organisation for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</p>
<p><strong>Leigh Hale<br>School of Physiotherapy</strong><br>Leigh Hale primarily researches in the area of community-based physiotherapeutic rehabilitation for people living with disability and with neurological conditions, such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease. Her research uses both quantitative and qualitative methodologies and focuses on how physiotherapists can enable people to optimally live healthy and engaging lives. Current research projects include evaluating community-based fall prevention programmes for older adults and for adults with intellectual disability; interventions to assist people living with disability and/or chronic conditions to sustain physical activity participation; evaluation of the Bridges Self-Management Programme for people post-stroke; accessibility of health and disability services for hauā (disabled) Māori; and the use of virtual reality and other technologies in upper limb stroke rehabilitation. This work has been funded both by University of Otago internal grants and external funding bodies, primarily the Health Research Council of New Zealand, ACC, Lottery Health and Physiotherapy New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>David Hutchinson<br>Department of Physics</strong><br>David Hutchinson’s research is primarily in the field of theoretical quantum physics. He has made contributions in the modelling of semiconductors, plasma physics, strongly correlated electron systems and ultracold atomic physics. It is in the understanding of the effects of the low, but finite, temperature in these cold gases that his work has had its largest impact. At absolute zero, an unachievable theoretical limit, ideally, all atoms occupy the lowest possible energy configuration. However, temperature and interactions between atoms in the real world mean some are not really in this lowest state, but are in excited states. These atoms are like the white light from a light bulb compared to the coherent atoms in the ground state which are analogous to laser light. These thermal and quantum fluctuations have important impact on the utility of ultracold gases to realise devices, such as rotation sensors and gravitometers. David has also been interested in the intimate connection between mathematics and physics.</p>
<p><strong>David Larsen<br>Department of Chemistry</strong><br>David Larsen&#39;s research develops chemical methodology for the synthesis of complex organic molecules that have potential for the treatment of human disease. He uses compounds found in nature, especially those that contain carbohydrates, as a template for chemical design for collaborative research projects with biologists and immunologists. The compounds include synthetic vaccines that provide insight into immunity against tumours and the synthesis of small molecules based upon cell wall components from mycobacterium tuberculosis for use against allergic diseases such as asthma. Another part of his research is aimed at developing molecules that can improve the viability of organs during storage for transport prior to transplantation. This involves the design and synthesis of compounds that release low levels of carbon monoxide gas under physiological conditions to the storage solution that results in protection of tissue. Success in this project could result in an increased number of organs available for transplant.</p>
<p><strong>Rhonda Rosengren<br>Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology</strong><br>Rhonda Rosengren’s research career has spanned two distinct arms. The development of novel drugs for triple negative breast cancer and hormone refractory prostate cancer as well as drug induced changes in liver function including drug interactions. We have shown mechanisms for various drug interactions with commonly used drugs including vitamin A, Paracetamol and St. John&#39;s wort. We have also synthesised and extensively characterised a suite of novel synthetic derivatives of the natural compound curcumin that we are developing for use in patients with aggressive and metastatic breast and prostate cancer. We are also investigating them as single agents or in combination with raloxifene, a drug currently used for osteoporosis. Ultimately, we aim to deliver both drugs using nanotechnology in order to increase both drug safety and potency by delivering the drug specifically to the tumour as well as to metastatic sites.</p>
<p><strong>Katherine Scott<br>Department of Psychological Medicine, Dunedin School of Medicine</strong><br>Kate Scott is a clinical psychologist whose early research was in experimental psychopathology. Her more recent research has been into the epidemiology of mental disorders. She is a senior investigator with the WHO’s World Mental Health Surveys Consortium, a cross-national project coordinating the implementation and analysis of epidemiologic surveys of mental disorders in 30 countries (including New Zealand). Part of Kate’s research has involved a focus on the links between mental and physical health. In a recent Health Research Council-funded project based on analyses of the World Mental Health Surveys dataset, Kate and her international collaborators established that mental disorders of all types are associated with accelerated onset of most chronic physical conditions. The wide-ranging nature of these mental-physical links has significant clinical and population health implications.</p>
<p><strong>Geoffrey Shaw<br>Department of Anaesthesia, University of Otago, Christchurch</strong><br>Geoff Shaw worked in paediatric and adult intensive care in Australia before moving back to Christchurch in 1998. He has a keen interest in biomedical engineering applications in critical care and has worked at Otago since 2003. He has over 470 publications including several patents. His research interests include modelling and control of the insulin-glucose system, cardiovascular dynamics, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and agitation in ICU patients. Geoff enjoys the challenge of teaching both medical and engineering students. Geoff has been a co-founder of three start-up biomedical companies: Lifevent, (Dunedin), Intersection Lifesciences and Tiro (Christchurch). He is also an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Canterbury, and is the first clinician to be made an honorary fellow of the Institute of Professional Engineers of New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>Takashi Shogimen<br>Department of History and Art History</strong><br>Since joining the University of Otago as a Lecturer in 2004, Takashi’s research has revolved around the history of political thought. His primary field of research is political thought in medieval Europe. After the publication of his 2007 monograph on the 14th-Century Franciscan philosopher William of Ockham from Cambridge University Press, Takashi produced a survey of medieval European political thought in Japanese, which was awarded the 2013 Suntory Prize for Social Sciences and Humanities. He has also published widely on modern Japanese political thought and cross-cultural comparison between European and Japanese political ideas. His work has enjoyed financial support from the Marsden Fund twice. Since July 2013 Takashi has been Associate Dean of Research for Humanities, supporting researchers within the Division of Humanities. He has also been a co-director of the University of Otago Research Theme “Comparative and Cross-Cultural Studies” to facilitate and promote interdisciplinary research in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Elisabeth Slooten<br>Department of Zoology</strong><br>Liz Slooten has been researching Hector’s and Maui’s dolphins for 30 years. These endangered dolphins are found only in New Zealand. Liz’s research has led to the creation of protected areas that have reduced dolphin bycatch in fishing nets. In collaboration with other staff and students at the University of Otago, she is also carrying out research on sperm whales, right whales, bottlenose dolphins and New Zealand sea lions. Her research is focused on marine mammal ecology and human impacts on their populations – including fishing, mining and tourism. Liz’s population viability analyses and risk analyses have helped the Government implement protection for marine mammals in New Zealand waters. Liz is a member of the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group and chaired the organising committee for a major international marine mammal conference held at University of Otago in December 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Young<br>Theatre Studies Programme, Department of Music</strong><br>Stuart Young’s research is strongly interdisciplinary, and combines scholarship and theatre practice which includes directing and translating. A long-standing focus of his research has been the production, reception, and rewriting of Russian drama, in particular Chekhov, in Britain. His interests also traverse translation studies and translation for the theatre; modern British drama; New Zealand theatre; gay/queer drama; and documentary/verbatim theatre. Documentary theatre has become the principal focus of Stuart’s research in recent years. He has been instrumental in pioneering the creation and production of this theatrical form in New Zealand. In collaboration with his Theatre Studies colleague Hilary Halba, other professional theatre-makers, and senior students, he has developed a particular form of “verbatim” theatre and created a portfolio of innovative plays.</p>
