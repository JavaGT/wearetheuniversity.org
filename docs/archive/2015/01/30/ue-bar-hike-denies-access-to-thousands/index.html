<p>UE bar hike denies access to thousands  </p>
<p>A Government rule change denying thousands of young Kiwis access to tertiary education is doing nothing to build a smart, fair future, Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson David Cunliffe said today.</p>
<p>“NZQA rules changed by the Government have reduced student enrolments from 71% to 58%, or by about 4000 students as UE has been lifted from NCEA 2 to NCEA 3.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s a massive shift that is biasing university education towards students who can afford to stay at school to year 13. Access to tertiary education is a crucial ingredient to building a fair society where any young person can dream big dreams and succeed.</p>
<p>&quot;Cutting access to thousands of young Kiwis is no way to build a smarter future for our country.</p>
<p>“NCEA results should not be seen as the only predictor of university success -plenty of young people hit life hurdles that disturb their studies, but bounce back later,” David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“Labour wants every New Zealander who has the ability and desire to study at university to be able to do so.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately National’s rule changes and higher fees are denying that birth right to the next generation and we will all be the poorer for it.”</p>
