<p><strong>Emeritus Prof Witten reviews first Massive Open Online Course in New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>Will Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) change the face of tertiary education in the future and what can Digital Cities, locally focussed online networks, mean for the local economy? These are just two of the subjects to be discussed later this month as part of the University of Waikato’s Treasuring the Bay symposium in Tauranga on Friday 23 January.</p>
<p>Emeritus Professor Ian Witten of the Department of Computer Science, University of Waikato will review New Zealand’s first MOOC launched by the Waikato University. With this MOOC the University is making expert knowledge of researchers and teaching staff available in a structured online environment. Professor Witten will describe the MOOC from conception to implementation, including the rewards for the university.</p>
<p>International guest speaker Barry Lerner is the Chief Information Officer of Huawei Technologies, South Pacific. He will discuss the importance of Digital Cities for the local economy. Mr Lerner is a recognised world expert in Digital Cities and has more than 30 years experience in the telecommunications industry.</p>
<p>Other presenters at the symposium will include Professor Chad Hewitt who is the Head of the School of Science in the Faculty of Science and Engineering. His research portfolio revolves around the role humans play in changing the natural world, particularly in marine systems, and how natural science can influence management and policy. He is recognised as a global expert on marine biological invasions and biosecurity governance at national and international levels.</p>
