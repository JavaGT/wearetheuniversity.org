<p>“The Prime Minister and Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor have once again declined to meet with Groundswell, turning their backs on a group who feels let down and betrayed by the Labour Government,” says ACT’s Primary Production spokesperson Mark Cameron.</p>
<p>“Groundswell represents a large group of New Zealanders who are doing it tough. Thousands of New Zealanders turned out to protest a raft of Government regulation in July.</p>
<p>“It’s astonishing the Government can see how alienated a group of people feel and yet not care enough to even meet with them.</p>
<p>“It’s been four months since the protest, the Prime Minister could find the time if she wanted to.</p>
<p>“The organisers of the Groundswell Protest have raised legitimate concerns about the issues facing rural New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Rural New Zealand has become a punching bag for the Government. They’ve taken blow after blow as a raft of new regulations shows just what this Government really thinks about the primary sector.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s freshwater and winter grazing, a ban on live exports, Significant Natural Areas, indigenous biodiversity or a tax on utes, Three Waters, rural New Zealand has taken a hammering.</p>
<p>“All 10 ACT MPs attended protests around New Zealand, and we will show our support for future protests.</p>
<p>“This is a Government that doesn’t listen. It has a ‘we know best’ attitude, shown last week with Three Waters and now with Groundswell. I will meet with Groundswell this Friday. I encourage the Prime Minister and Minister to take 15 minutes of time to do the same.”</p>
