<p><strong>Tuesday, 9 November 2021, 1:30 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Government’s plan to underwrite events is picking winners and condemning small events businesses to the scrap heap, says National’s Economic Development and Tourism spokesperson Todd McClay.</p>
<p>“Labour’s scheme disregards small-event organisers, such as wedding venues and business conferences with fewer than 5000 attendees. These businesses face just as much uncertainty due to Covid as their larger counterparts.</p>
<p>“This announcement will be a kick in the teeth for small events businesses who continue to lose money with Auckland and Waikato in lockdown.</p>
<p>“The events scheme will be welcome news for large festivals and gatherings but, after months of inaction, many will have already cancelled their events.</p>
<p>“The Minister’s announcement has come months after it was requested by the sector. Organisers who have had to cancel their events over the past two-and-a-half months will not be covered.</p>
<p>“National had the solutions. National’s policy, announced as part of our ‘Back to Business’ package, would see large events covered by $50 million in event insurance, and $20 million for small events.</p>
<p>“Kiwi businesses deserve confidence and support regardless of their size. By playing favourites, Labour has pushed small events businesses further towards closure.”</p>
