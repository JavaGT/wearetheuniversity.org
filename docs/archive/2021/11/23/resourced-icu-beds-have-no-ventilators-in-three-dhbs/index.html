<p><strong>Tuesday, 23 November 2021, 1:33 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Andrew Little needs to explain why some DHBs are counting ICU beds as “resourced” despite not having enough ventilators for those beds, says National’s Health spokesperson Dr Shane Reti.</p>
<p>“An ICU bed includes the ability to support breathing with a ventilator. But in at least three DHBs, Andrew Little is claiming ‘resourced’ ICU beds despite not enough ventilators for those beds.</p>
<p>“How can you have a ‘resourced’ ICU bed without a ventilator?</p>
<p>“Ventilators are especially important given Covid is a condition that mostly affects the lungs.</p>
<p>“South Canterbury, Tairāwhiti and Whanganui all have more ‘resourced’ ICU beds than they have ventilators and, just a few days ago, Whanganui reported it actually only had skilled nurses to operate three of their four ventilators.</p>
<p>“Last week, Andrew Little was hiding the real adult bed ICU numbers by mixing in paediatric beds. This week, he is pretending resourced ICU beds don’t need a ventilator. He is wrong, and way out of his depth on the ICU beds issue.</p>
<p>“Andrew Little failed to prepare the health system by building more ICU beds after the first outbreak last year. This has contributed to long lockdowns and 100,000 cancelled procedures.</p>
<p>“The Minister needs to redo the ICU inventory with actual ‘resourced’ ICU beds with a ventilator and 5.3 nurses per bed. When he does, that he will find the authors of a recent <em>New Zealand Medical Journal</em> article were correct in saying there are only 67 surge ICU beds, and not the hundreds he is claiming.”</p>
