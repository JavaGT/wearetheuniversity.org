<p><strong>Wednesday, 17 November 2021, 3:53 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Re-opening schools today in Auckland and Waikato has been great for some, but too many are still missing out, National’s Education Spokesperson Paul Goldsmith said today.</p>
<p>“The Minister’s admission that five Auckland schools have decided against any onsite learning for the remainder of 2021 demonstrates the Government’s plans are too loose.</p>
<p>“With just three or four weeks of school time left in 2021, many other schools have left it till next week to reopen.</p>
<p>“Many parents had been shocked to learn their kids will go back to school next week, but only for one or two days.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Education’s programme to reverse our truancy crisis is called ‘every day matters’ however the Government appears to have missed this memo.</p>
<p>“Given the damage that missed school time causes, we would have expected the Government to act with more decisiveness and urgency.</p>
<p>“The consequence is kids learning progress and wellbeing continues to be harmed and more are at risk of dis-engaging from education entirely.</p>
<p>“Kids only get one shot at their school years. The Government’s complacency is robbing students of the full opportunities a great education can provide.</p>
<p>“At a bare minimum everyone should be back on-site every day for half days, to give our kids a chance of reengaging with their education before the long summer.”</p>
