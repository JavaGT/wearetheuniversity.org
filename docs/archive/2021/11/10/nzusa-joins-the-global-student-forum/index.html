<p>The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) has joined the Global Student Forum (GSF).</p>
<p>NZUSA joins 198 student unions from 120 different countries in the GSF, the worldwide umbrella organisation of democratic, independent and representative student organisations.</p>
<p>The NZUSA National Education Officer, Ellen Dixon, has been selected to represent the Pacific on the GSF Steering Committee due to her knowledge and expertise in student activism at a local and global level.</p>
<p>“It is an honour to be nominated by NZUSA to represent the Pacific on the GSF Steering Committee, and a privilege to stand in solidarity and partnership with the global student movement” says Dixon.</p>
<p>“Upholding student voice and human rights is essential, especially considering the existential threats students and youth are facing from climate change, economic uncertainty, and COVID-19. I acknowledge the transformative capacity of global student initiatives for education and the wider international community” says Dixon.</p>
<p>NZUSA National Vice President, Liam Davies says “Ellen’s extensive knowledge and experience in student and youth activism will put her in a good position to tackle the myriad of challenges students face globally”.</p>
<p>“NZUSA’s membership to the GSF, and the role we play in their governance structure, could not have come at a better time. COVID-19 has caused a myriad of issues that directly impact students, and for NZUSA and Ellen to champion the voice of the Pacific in a global setting is a welcome opportunity to share experiences and work together, to find common solutions”.</p>
