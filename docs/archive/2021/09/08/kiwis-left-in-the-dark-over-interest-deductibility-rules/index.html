<p><strong>Wednesday, 8 September 2021, 4:31 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The new rules relating to mortgage interest deductibility, cunningly renamed the Interest Limitation Rules, are due to come into force on 1 October without a proper explanation of how they will even work in practice, National’s Shadow Treasurer Andrew Bayly says.</p>
<p>“Over the past year the only information shared with New Zealanders about how the mortgage interest deductibility rules would work in practice, other than the initial discussion document, has been a single press release issued by Revenue Minister Parker in June last year.</p>
<p>“Effectively, the Government is making a fundamental change to a decades-old policy so that owners cannot deduct interest expenses from their mortgages on residential properties.</p>
<p>“Labour likes to label this as closing a ‘tax loophole’, but it isn’t, and New Zealand’s tax professionals agree. This is a fundamental principle of tax policy, one that has existed for years until this Labour Government decided to change it.</p>
<p>“The new rules will apply from 1 October. The Government had promised to deliver the proposed legislation by then. But it hasn’t and as a consequence Kiwis haven’t seen the details.</p>
<p>“Taxpayers have a right to know how the new Interest Limitation rules will work in practice: for example, what is the definition of a ‘new build’ and who will be entitled to the concession to deduct interest and for how long; and whether build-to-rent properties will be captured under the interest deductibility rules,” Mr Bayly says.</p>
<p>National’s Housing spokesperson Nicola Willis says National has previously questioned the Minister on the bright-line rules that came into force earlier this year.</p>

<p>“New Zealanders want to know how the new rules will affect parents who purchase a property for their child to rent while at university, or what will happen to farm owners who rent out cottages on their property to employees.</p>
<p>“Kiwis want clarification from the Government, but they aren’t getting any.</p>
<p>“The Government shouldn’t be introducing fundamental changes to the tax system without going through a proper select committee process and giving the public the chance to have their say, before finalising the legislation.</p>
<p>“On that basis National is calling on the Government to delay the rules coming into effect from 1 October to 1 April 2022.</p>
<p>“We believe the process is flawed and we’re not alone, many tax experts agree. The proposed decisions are unworkable and pay no heed to decades-old tax principles.</p>
<p>“National is committed to reversing the changes when in Government,” Ms Willis says.</p>
