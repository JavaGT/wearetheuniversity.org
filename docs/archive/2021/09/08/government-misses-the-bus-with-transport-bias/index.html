<p><strong>Wednesday, 8 September 2021, 3:25 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Government’s “flagship” transport plan ignores the opportunities to adopt smart transport solutions while developing a stronger nationwide road network that can help bolster public transport solutions, says National’s Transport spokesperson David Bennett.</p>
<p>“It fails to invest in the infrastructure required for an economy in a Covid pandemic. The Government is still focused on niche projects – not connectivity, productivity and growth on a national scale.</p>
<p>“We need to embrace clean energy sources for cars, and strive for greater efficiency of bus networks. This includes a faster transition to electric cars and buses. Roads are key to ongoing growth and the adaption of modern technologies.</p>
<p>“Instead, all the Government has offered is an anti-road transport plan with a disproportionate amount of money spent on walking and cycling lanes that have cost more than $2 million per kilometre.</p>
<p>“The public has already rejected niche and expensive follies in the soon-to-be defunct Auckland Harbour Bridge crossing. Everyday Kiwis know what’s best for their travel plans, and this transport plan continues the Government’s fixation with out-of-touch, nice-to-have projects, rather than what is actually needed.”</p>
<p>Key issues in the plan are:</p>
<p>· The introduction of a track user charge on rail – essentially a new tax</p>
<p>· The relegation of Auckland Light Rail to planning and design, with no prospect of construction</p>
<p>· The Eastern Busway left in limbo</p>

<p>· Hyped-up maintenance funding that will barely cover cost increases and the extra kilometres of roads included in this category</p>
<p>· Speed limit reductions on 16,500km of roads</p>
<p>· Millions spent on cycleways while motorists remain stuck in queues</p>
<p>· Some regions are effectively ignored, for example, Canterbury and Waikato making up nearly a quarter of New Zealand’s population but only getting an eighth of the transport budget</p>
<p>· A $2 billion loan given just to plug the financials without plans for interest and repayment</p>
<p>“This is not a transport plan for the future,” says Mr Bennett. “It fails to take into account technological changes in transport modes. It’s fixated with a Government bias. It’s like putting a Boeing 777 jet on a regional route and a turbo-prop on a main city route. It doesn’t make commercial sense and misses a golden opportunity to invest in our productive sectors.”</p>
