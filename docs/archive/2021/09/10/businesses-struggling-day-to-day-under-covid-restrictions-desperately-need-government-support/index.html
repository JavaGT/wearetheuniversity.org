<p><strong>Friday, 10 September 2021, 12:55 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Each day matters for hardworking businesses struggling under Level 4 lockdown in Auckland and new Level 2 restrictions elsewhere in the country, National’s Economic Development and Small Business spokesperson Todd McClay says.</p>
<p>“The Government this week again said it would consider more support for businesses as the Covid lockdown restrictions drag into a fifth week. However, for too many business it will be too late – unless Grant Robertson acts now.</p>
<p>“The number of likely business casualties is growing daily without additional Government assistance. Levels of distress in Auckland are extreme, and small businesses around the country continue to struggle.</p>
<p>“Calls to National MPs from business owners who have run out of options are growing in number by the day.</p>
<p>“New, more restrictive Level 2 rules such as a limit of 50 people in restaurants and bars means thousands of businesses will not be sustainable and will need to take on more debt to survive.</p>
<p>“Many of these businesses covered their costs last week using the Government’s one-off resurgence payment. However, this week’s rent is now due and next week’s bills are piling up. All the while, the Government sits on its hands.</p>
<p>“Last week, Mr Robertson said he would consider National’s proposal to assist businesses struggling to pay their rent as a result of Covid restrictions. But, this week, he said the Minister of Justice was still looking at it. I say to Mr Robertson: these hardworking Kiwis cannot wait one more week. They need a decision now.</p>

<p>“With more than 80 per cent of hospitality businesses saying they are unsustainable after four weeks of restrictions, the Government needs to recognise this is serious. It must act now.</p>
<p>“Kiwis have done everything asked of them by the Government. We have all made significant sacrifices. But businesses need the Government to recognise their sacrifice and make a decision on additional support.</p>
<p>“They are fast running out of time.”</p>
