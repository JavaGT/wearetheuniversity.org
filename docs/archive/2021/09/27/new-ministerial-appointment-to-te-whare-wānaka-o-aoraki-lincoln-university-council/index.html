<p>Tauranga dairy farmer and kiwifruit grower David Jensen has been appointed to Te Whare Wānaka o Aoraki Lincoln University’s Council by Education Minister Hon Chris Hipkins.</p>

<p>“We are pleased to welcome David to Council. His background and extensive experience in the rural sector is an ideal fit for our specialist land-based University.</p>
<p>“He is a passionate advocate for enhancing the rural sector, and he understands the significant opportunities of producing food in a manner that both supports the natural environment and improves productivity.</p>
<p>“His unique perspective will bring added impetus to our drive to shape a better future through unlocking the power of the land.”</p>
<p>Minister Hipkins also reappointed current Council member Janice Fredric to a second four-year term, through to 7 September 2025.</p>
<p>An experienced Chair and professional director with over 20 years’ governance experience, Ms Fredric has a broad portfolio of directorships with experience in commercial, Crown and not-for-profit sectors.</p>
