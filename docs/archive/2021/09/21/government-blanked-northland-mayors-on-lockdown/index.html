<p><strong>Tuesday, 21 September 2021, 11:05 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Jacinda Ardern’s Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet consulted Northland’s three Labour MPs but not Northland’s mayors before extending the region’s level 4 lockdown.</p>
<p>“This was a contentious lockdown for many Northlanders, especially when Northland had no positive cases and many businesses and communities suffered,” says Dr Shane Reti, National list MP based in Whangarei.</p>
<p>“Ministerial answers show Northland mayors were ‘told’ that Northland was staying at level 4 with Auckland 30 minutes before the announcement, yet iwi and the Labour three Northland MPs – Kelvin Davis, Willow-Jean Prime and Emily Henderson were ‘extensively engaged’ 24 hours beforehand.</p>
<p>“The purpose of the meetings was ‘to cover potential boundary considerations for Auckland/Northland, locations, checkpoints, compliance, travel permissions and community needs arising at COVID-19, Alert Level 4’.</p>
<p>“Northland mayors could have made important contributions to lockdown boundaries, checkpoints and community need, and chambers of commerce and small businesses are also key stakeholders.</p>
<p>“Even worse, a week previously – and just a few days into lockdown – a similar meeting had been held with iwi. Again, the mayors were not invited.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister’s office should explain why it saw fit to brief its three Labour MPs but not Northland’s three mayors.</p>
<p>“The Labour MPs also need to answer why they didn’t involve the mayors, and the Prime Minister needs to reassure Northlanders that this was not a spiteful politicisation of Covid, given Northland’s mayors have been vocal in opposition to the Government’s Three Waters proposals.”</p>
