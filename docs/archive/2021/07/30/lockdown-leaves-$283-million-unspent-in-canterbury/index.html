<p><strong>Friday, 30 July 2021, 12:30 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>New research has found a $283 million difference in retail spending in Canterbury between 2019 and 2020 due to the Covid-19 Lockdown.</p>
<p><em>Covid-19, the effect of lockdowns on retail expenditure and displacement effects on the regional economy</em>, was co-authored By Lincoln University’s Dr David Dyason, with Peter Fieger of the University of New England, and Riaan Rossouw, from South Africa’s North-West University.</p>
<p>The study looked at the impact of reduced retail spending from the urban Christchurch population on the wider-regional economy through the inter-and intra-regional economic effects of the COVID-</p>
<p>19 lockdown.</p>
<p>The results reveal how consumer spending variations has far-reaching consequences in employment in connected, but unsuspecting geographies, through the economic value chain.</p>
<p>It found that during the strict lockdown regime overall retail spending declined substantially.</p>
<p>That translated into 3,605 lost jobs in Canterbury, with the majority of those lost concentrated in Christchurch (3,398) followed by Ashburton (62) and Timaru (40).</p>
<p>“The results of the research reveal how changes in spending habits have a considerable effect on economic activity, jobs and income levels, propagated through the value chains and beyond territorial boundaries to industries that support the retail activity, ” Dr Dyason said.</p>
<p>“The place where the spending occurs represents the final destination of the transaction, and one tends to forget how it impacts the economic activity during earlier value-adding activity, such as primary production, located elsewhere.”</p>
<p>While there was some additional spending evident in the form of pent-up demand immediately after the cessation of the lockdown, the economic impact of a significant amount of &#39;unspent&#39; money during the lockdown remained months after the lockdown ended, the study found.</p>
<p>It remains up for debate if this represents an uncertainty premium for consumers within the economy, which is being saved or kept for a proverbial &#39;rainy day&#39; that could potentially re-emerge. Alternatively, it could also be used as deposits or down payment for residential property ownership.</p>
