<p>“<a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=zWgXK33dyCK3GU6YTGqNH3W-P-MxSqugWwZ0q_0SHD1jiQ4cTcCk38yvYTVJaXSN47yoNjbC9F_EDXmF5t_JKmaIvSepWOZ8JQQhFZ4ei1rABJYJuuuPkTnjyp-sTL6xRntDeQNQVyLJT5p2NwZiS1sJktr5FJH69m7fISCXp-I&e=752ed10e9ed7db3a7867d6b86ebadc6c&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=experts_renter_tax&n=2">The experts are in agreement</a>: Labour’s proposed change to interest deductibility rules is a renter’s tax,” says ACT’s Housing Spokesperson Brooke van Velden.</p>
<p>“A majority of economists, academics and property experts believe the impacts of the Government’s housing changes will be borne by tenants.</p>
<p>“More than a dozen experts surveyed expect rents to increase due to higher tax bills faced by residential property investors.</p>
<p>“Let’s be clear: This is a renter’s tax.</p>
<p>“All of the stories ACT is hearing at <a href="http://act.org.nz/housingstories">act.org.nz/housingstories</a> confirm that.</p>
<p>“Landlords are telling us <em>‘I’ve kept rents below the market rate for several years, but these changes will force me to hike them, and I don’t know if my tenants will be able to afford it.’</em></p>
<p>“This divisive policy targets residential property investors, but it will actually hurt some of the most vulnerable people in New Zealand</p>
<p>“Labour just doesn’t get it. We can’t tax and regulate our way out of a housing crisis. We need to make it easier for the private sector to build houses.</p>

<p>“The Government’s Healthy Homes rules, foreign buyer ban, KiwiBuild, and myriad other policies have all failed for the simple reason that they misdiagnose the problem.</p>
<p>“ACT’s answer is for the next generation to build like the Boomers.</p>
<p>“ACT would radically overhaul infrastructure funding, through a 30-year partnerships with central government for each region.</p>
<p>“We’d then replace the Resource Management Act with legislation designed to facilitate home building, and get councils out of the building consent business.</p>
<p>“Industry insiders tell me that ACT’s plan is the only one that would actually work to get homes built, but the Government is focusing on scapegoating a particular group of New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“Rather than dividing, the Government should be uniting New Zealanders behind good ideas.”</p>
