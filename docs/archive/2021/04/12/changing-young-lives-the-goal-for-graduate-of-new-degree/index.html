<p><strong>Monday, 12 April 2021, 11:17 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>A drive to help troubled young people get their lives back on track lies behind Alex Wilson’s decision to study criminal justice at the University of Canterbury (UC).</p>
<p>The 22-year-old will become one of the first six people to graduate with a Master of Criminal Justice (MCJ) degree from UC at a Christchurch Town Hall ceremony on Wednesday [April 14].</p>
<p>UC is holding three graduation ceremonies for nearly 1100 graduands in the central city this week, two on Wednesday and one on Friday.</p>
<p>Wilson initially had plans to apply for police college but her studies revealed other choices and opportunities, she says.</p>
<p>“I’ve learned so much about youth justice and it’s opened my eyes to what I really want to do. It’s really cool to be one of the first group to graduate with an MCJ. It’s a small class so we’ve become close and we’re looking forward to celebrating our graduation together.”</p>

<p>The post-graduate MCJ qualification, which gives students advanced knowledge of the criminal justice system, was introduced at the University of Canterbury for the first time last year.</p>
<p>UC Criminal Justice Director Jarrod Gilbert says the Masters course gives students an even greater skillset before entering the workforce. “I feel immensely proud of these first graduates. I think our criminal justice system will be better off with them contributing to it.”</p>
<p>Wilson, who already has a Bachelor of Criminal Justice from UC, has worked part-time at Te Puna Wai ō Tuhinapo youth justice residence in Rolleston while studying and is now looking for a full-time role where she hopes to help young people stay out of crime.</p>
<p>“Working at the residence has made me realise what these kids have gone through and how they don’t have support networks around them. I understand more about the importance of that support in preventing crime and trying to stop young people ending up in the youth justice system or in prison,” she says.</p>
<p>“The MCJ course was very discussion-based and we talked a lot of about what’s happening in our criminal justice system today. We also visited Rolleston Prison and had several experts come in and talk to us about their experiences.”</p>
<p>UC Tumu Whakarae | Vice-Chancellor Professor Cheryl de la Rey says graduation ceremonies are important occasions that recognise and celebrate the commitment and hard work that go into achieving a degree.</p>
<p>“The University has strong connections with the city and we invite local people to take this opportunity to share in our students’ success after years of hard work.</p>
<p>“University of Canterbury graduates make a significant contribution to the Canterbury community and economy. Almost half – 47 per cent – of employed UC graduates who finished their study in 2019 found work in Ōtautahi Christchurch and the surrounding area.”</p>
<p>Canterbury Employers’ Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Leeann Watson says the influx of students and their whānau this week will bring a welcome boost to local hospitality and retail businesses.</p>
<p>“Graduation ceremonies bring a real buzz and excitement to the city and they also demonstrate that Ōtautahi Christchurch continues to be a hub of quality education and innovation. We congratulate UC graduates and wish them every success for the future.”</p>
