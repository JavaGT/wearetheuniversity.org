<p><strong>Thursday, 22 April 2021, 3:31 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Proposed changes to the Education and Training Act 2020 are part of an ongoing attack on school choice by Labour, National’s Education spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>“Labour is hell-bent on a one-size-fits-all approach to our education system.”</p>
<p>The Government is proposing to deprioritise children and siblings of former students in a school’s out-of-zone application process, Mr Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>“Some parents greatly value the opportunity to send their children to a school they went to themselves. They value family traditions and want that choice within the public system.</p>
<p>“What is the great mischief the Government is trying to prevent?</p>
<p>“Of course, axing partnership schools was the first move Labour made in education. They’ve also given the Education Ministry significantly more power to determine school zones.</p>
<p>“Labour’s clear agenda is to eliminate choice from our schooling system. This is based on ideology rather than what’s best for parents and students who, for a host of reasons, may want a few choices when it comes to which school they attend.”</p>
