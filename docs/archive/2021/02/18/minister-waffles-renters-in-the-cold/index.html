<p>“Housing Minister Megan Woods’ vague promises of supply measures to ease housing pressures won’t help a single renter struggling to get a roof over their head,” says ACT Housing spokesperson Brooke van Velden.</p>
<p>“TradeMe data out today shows the median weekly rent for medium houses across New Zealand reached a new record in January, while the biggest annual increase was in one-to-two bedroom houses.</p>
