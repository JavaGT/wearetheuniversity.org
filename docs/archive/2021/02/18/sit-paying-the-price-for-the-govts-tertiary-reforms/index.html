<p><strong>Thursday, 18 February 2021, 1:40 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The SIT subsidiary board’s decision to cancel the Kelvin Street apartments is short-sighted, MP for Invercargill Penny Simmonds says.</p>
<p>“The decision is a perfect example of what happens when a board made up of people predominately from outside the Southland community are appointed to run our well-performing tertiary institution.</p>
<p>“While the demand from international students is down right now due to Covid-19 and our borders being closed, it will take two years to build the apartments and by then it is very likely international students will be back.</p>
<p>“But even with the borders closed the current SIT apartments are full this year.</p>
<p>“Not only would the apartments provide much needed housing in Invercargill, they would’ve also provided a construction boost and created jobs for our community.</p>
<p>“National has always opposed the Government’s tertiary reforms for this very reason. The local community has always been best placed to identify and address the needs of the community.</p>
<p>“Rather than undermining the expertise of the regions, we should be building confidence and trust in them to deliver within their communities.</p>
<p>“But the Government’s reforms have stripped away this autonomy, and now SIT is paying the price.”</p>
