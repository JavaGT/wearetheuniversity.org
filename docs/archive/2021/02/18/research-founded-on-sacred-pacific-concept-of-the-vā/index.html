<p>New Pacific research from AUT puts the sacred concept of the <em>vā</em> at the heart of its study.</p>
<p>For pan-Pacific peoples, the <em>vā</em> is generally acknowledged as the relational spaces that bind and unify all people and things.</p>
<p>Nationwide, more than 500,000 Kiwi adults live with low literacy and numeracy (L/N) skills. Māori and Pacific peoples are strongly over-represented in this cohort.</p>
<p>Led by AUT’s NZ Work Research Institute, “The expression, experience and transcendence of low-skill in Aotearoa, New Zealand” is a qualitative study that explores the barriers against and enablers to transcending this low skill base.</p>
<p>The Pacific component of the research aims to understand the reality of what does and doesn’t work for Pacific peoples living with low L/N skills - how they became part of this cohort in the first place, how their lives and livelihoods are affected by low L/N skills, and what kind of pathways could help them improve these skills.</p>
<p>Dr Betty Ofe-Grant (AUT Business School) leads the Pacific component of the study, which will comprise 150 – 200+ participants recruited from Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. Focus groups and interviews will be conducted by research assistants of Pasifika descent.</p>
<p>Dr Ofe-Grant says it is vital that participants are “seeing themselves” represented in the small group discussions and interviews, which are also founded on a Pacific framework.</p>
<p>“For Pacific peoples, the <em>vā</em> underpins all aspects of our lives – yet many Pacific-focused programmes and initiatives fail to incorporate this all-important concept into their approaches or outcomes. We are committed to creating inclusive environments, so our participants feel safe to share their experiences with low L/N skills. Similarly, the way we understand and interpret their responses will be founded in <em>teu le vā</em>, or Pacific methodology and analysis,” says Dr Ofe-Grant.</p>
<p>The impact of low L/N skills has significant economic and social costs nationwide, including increased risk of unemployment and poverty, detrimental effects on physical and mental well-being, and decreased social and political connection.</p>
<p>Dr Ofe-Grant says the research objectives include policy recommendations, effective interventions that align with the OECD focus on skills development, and implementation of a holistic, fresh and integrated response that is mindful of entrenched patterns of social and economic insecurity.</p>
