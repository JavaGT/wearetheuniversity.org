<p>In Reaction To The Government Release Today Of Its Proposed History Curriculum For New Zealand Schools, AUT History Professor Paul Moon Says:</p>
<p>“This consultation document is a substantial opportunity and a major step in nation building. I encourage the public to give feedback.</p>
<p>“For the first time in several generations, there will be an opportunity for New Zealand students to learn about their own country in a thorough and systematic way. This will certainly help our sense of how we have evolved as a nation.</p>
<p>“The design of the curriculum allows students to develop a knowledge of the past, but also to appreciate that there are very different interpretations of that past.</p>
<p>“It is great that it emphasizes the role students can play in determining the meaning and significance of historical events for themselves. Rather than merely rote-learning dates and names, this is an effort to immerse students in the forces and events that continue to shape the country.</p>
<p>“This curriculum will strengthen the overall study of history in New Zealand. It is knowledge that is vitally important to all. In one sense, it serves as a sort-of instruction manual for how the world works.”</p>
<p>“I think that once students see the practical benefits of learning history, the subject’s popularity at universities like AUT will surge.”</p>
<p><strong>History is one of the fastest-growing disciplines at the Auckland University of Technology, with an</strong> <strong>expanding range of papers</strong> <strong>encompassing a variety of topics.</strong></p>
