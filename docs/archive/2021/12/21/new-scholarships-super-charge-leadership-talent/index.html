<p><strong>Tuesday, 21 December 2021, 1:48 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>Three outstanding Canterbury businesspeople have been chosen from a number of high-calibre applicants for a new scholarship programme.</p>
<p>The Ben Gough Family Foundation Leaders Scholarships were launched by the Foundation in partnership with the University of Canterbury Business School earlier this year with the goal of accelerating leadership talent.</p>
<p>Simon Shelton, Kirsty Tyro and Sarah How have been selected as the first three successful scholars.</p>
<p>They will each receive a substantial contribution towards their course fees for a University of Canterbury Master of Business Administration degree, collaboration with a high-profile mentor, specialised leadership coaching and an Outward Bound Professional Development course.</p>

<p>Founder of the Ben Gough Family Foundation and business leader Ben Gough says the scholarships are designed to super-charge leadership talent by providing an experience that combines formal study with practical workshops, professional development courses and leadership mentoring.</p>
<p>“The scholars will also have a unique opportunity to engage with a wide range of business and community networks that will help to accelerate and enhance their development pathways.”</p>
<p>Ben and Penny Gough established the Foundation within their Family Office, which incorporates their commercial and investment enterprise and family and philanthropic activity.</p>
<p>“We knew that Waitaha Canterbury had an incredible pool of leadership talent but the quality of the applicants has really exceeded our expectations.</p>
<p>“We look forward to introducing these three scholars to our network of contacts, seeing them flourish with the help of their mentors, and learn and grow from the challenge of their MBA studies at the University of Canterbury.”</p>
<p>University of Canterbury MBA Director Associate Professor Michaela Balzarova says it’s exciting to have the first cohort of scholars beginning their studies in 2022.</p>
<p>“These are people who have already shown considerable drive, innovation and talent in their careers so far, so we can’t wait to see where an MBA from the University of Canterbury will take them.”
