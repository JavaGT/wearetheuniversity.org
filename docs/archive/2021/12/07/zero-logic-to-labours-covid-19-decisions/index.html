<p>“The Government is making ad hoc COVID-19 decisions that don’t meet its own criteria. We need clarity, certainty and common sense for New Zealanders to buy into the Traffic Light System”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“The Government’s Traffic Light System says a region will be in Red when the health system faces an ‘unsustainable number of hospitalisations’.</p>
<p>“It’s clear the health system isn’t being overwhelmed right now.</p>
<p>“Ashley Bloomfield said six days ago that ‘our hospitalisations have very much levelled off across Tāmaki Makaurau’.</p>
<p>“Today in Parliament, Jacinda Ardern agreed and said there had been a decline in hospitalisations. She explained the decision to put Auckland in Red by saying at the start of the Traffic Light System the Government would be doing things differently.</p>
<p>“What’s the point in having criteria if you’re not going to use them? New Zealanders should be able to look at a government website and know what they read is correct.</p>
<p>“None of it makes any sense. As usual, the Government is just making it up as it goes along.</p>
<p>“If the hospital system in regions at Red aren’t facing an unsustainable number of hospitalisations, why on earth are those places at Red?</p>
<p>“There’s also no logic to the fact that the South Island is in Orange given it doesn’t meet the criteria of having community transmission.</p>
<p>“Labour’s logic at the border is also lacking.</p>
<p>“Does the risk of fully-vaccinated, negative-tested New Zealanders returning home and self-isolating really outweigh the benefit of them spending Christmas with their families when thousands who’ve tested positive can self-isolate?</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, keeping the border closed until April, while Australian and Canadian schools and universities are back in the market for international students, seriously holds back the economy.</p>
<p>“The Government needs to start balancing all of the costs of COVID-19.</p>
