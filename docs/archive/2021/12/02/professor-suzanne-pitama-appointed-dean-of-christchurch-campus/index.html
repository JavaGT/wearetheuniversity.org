<p><strong>Thursday, 2 December 2021, 2:58 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Otago">University of Otago</a></strong></p>
<p>An historic day for wahine Māori leadership at the University of Otago.</p>
<p>Professor Suzanne Pitama (Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāti Whare) has been appointed the new Dean and Head of Campus at the University of Otago, Christchurch.</p>
<p>The former Director of the Māori Indigenous Health Institute (MIHI), and Associate Dean Māori, University of Otago, Christchurch becomes the first Māori female Dean of any Otago Medical School.</p>
<p>Professor Pitama states she was encouraged to apply for the position by her colleagues, and now sees the opportunity to continue to build on the strengths within the Christchurch campus.</p>
<p>“I’m feeling excited about the opportunities we have to move forward on some really key initiatives, which includes the implementation of a governance structure that aligns with Te Tiriti, preparing ourselves for the huge health reforms next year and ensuring our campus is well placed to address equity in our community.”</p>
<p>Professor Pitama’s appointment caps an impressive rise from her first appointment as Lecturer in the Department of Public Health at the University of Otago, Christchurch in 2001.</p>
<p>She has actively participated in many service roles including as the Hauora Māori Faculty Lead in the Otago Medical School, which includes chairing the Hauora Māori sub-committee, The University of Otago, Christchurch Senior Leadership team, a co-Director of Te Poutama Rau (Māori andragogy research theme) and the working group for the new Mirror on Society policy for the University’s health professional courses.</p>

<p>She is also one of the Māori sub-editors on the New Zealand Medical Journal, was a special issue editor for The Clinical Teacher (on diversity and equity), and serves on two boards: The Health Council of New Zealand, and the Australian Medical Council of which she chairs the Indigenous committees within each organisation.</p>
<p>Professor Pitama won the Royal Society of New Zealand’s Joan Metge Medal in 2018, and the Prime Minister’s Supreme Award for Tertiary Teaching Excellence in 2015.</p>
<p>Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Helen Nicholson says Professor Pitama has demonstrated excellent leadership in the University and wider community.</p>
<p>“She has a clear vision for the University of Otago, Christchurch and is very well respected throughout the University of Otago Christchurch, and the wider University,” she says.</p>
<p>“Professor Pitama has already inspired numerous up and coming Māori female academics and this a</p>
<p>really significant appointment in terms of providing a strong role model for the wahine of the future.”</p>
<p>The importance of succession is something Professor Pitama is already aware of. A proud Ngāti Kahungunu/Ngāti Whare wahine, she says many Māori leaders have paved the way before her within the University of Otago.</p>
<p>“When I think of our earliest graduates like Te Rangihiroa, the first Māori Dean of a Medical School, Professor Eru Pomare, the work in te reo Māori from Professor Poia Rewi, and mana wahine leadership like Professor Jacinta Ruru, I realise the mahi they put in, and the work laid before me now to build on their legacies.”</p>
<p>Professor Pitama assumes the role from Professor David Murdoch, who was announced as the University’s new Vice-Chancellor earlier this year.</p>
<p>She paid tribute to Professor Murdoch, who like Professor Pitama will begin his new role in February.</p>
<p>“Professor David Murdoch has been an amazing leader here at the University of Otago, with a real committment to Hauora Māori and equity. His leadership style is both to lead by example, and to coach and provide support from the sidelines.</p>
<p>“His recent support of our mobile vaccination team in partnership with mana whenua demonstrated his committment to social justice and accountability.”</p>
<p>It is with the same values of social justice and social acccountability that Professor Pitama hopes to embrace her new leadership opportunity.</p>
