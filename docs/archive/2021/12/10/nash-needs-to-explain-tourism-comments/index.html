<p>“Tourism operators are rightly freaking out about <a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=rDKGPE8eb9MZAxv080Z2A67Kxaao8UiJCpp_NVC5FTT7oaY4UT0Y656Op6aRcllkT8PsGfIem41bbVAL9HSmzDo0yTNo8mq2Q7nHQkyujFYlU6XEH9Z7JBlLt7942_p8&e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nash_needs_to_explain&n=2">comments made by Stuart Nash</a> about when the borders will reopen and he owes us an explanation,” says ACT’s Tourism spokesperson James McDowall.</p>
<p>“The Government’s worst failing during the COVID crisis has been a lack clarity and certainty, particularly for business operators who have been doing it tough.</p>
<p>“Now Nash has told tourism operators it could be another 12-months before the borders open. Then he said there were “a whole lot of variables.”</p>
<p>“Tourism operators just want some certainty. If Kiwis can return from Australia in January, is it really going to take another 12-months to open up to the rest of the world?</p>
<p>“Nash’s comments come as we record the lowest tourism expenditure since 2011, the COVID response and pandemic has sent tourism back a decade.</p>
<p>“The Tourism Satellite Account released today shows a reduction in tourism expenditure of $15.6 billion, the lowest direct value of tourism to GDP on record- a $7.7 billion reduction, the lowest number of people employed in tourism on record since 2000 and a $4.1 billion reduction from international student expenditure (for short term students).</p>
<p>“Either Nash should apologise, Nash should resign, or Ardern should sack him. One way or another the Prime Minister has to take responsibility.”</p>
