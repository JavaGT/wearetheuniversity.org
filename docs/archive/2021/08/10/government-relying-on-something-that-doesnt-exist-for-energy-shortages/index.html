<p><strong>Tuesday, 10 August 2021, 2:37 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“When questioned by the ACT Party about the risk of energy shortages, Energy and Resources Minister Megan Woods said she’s considering a range of projects through the NZ Battery Project which doesn’t even exist yet,” says ACT’s Energy spokesperson Simon Court.</p>
<p>“The Battery Project doesn’t have a business case. The most optimistic outlook for construction starting is 2024. There’s no way it will be operating before 2030.</p>
<p>“Yet in reply to Written Parliamentary Questions from ACT, Megan Woods said “The Government is considering a range of options to mitigate against the risk of energy shortages in a dry year through the NZ Battery project.”</p>
<p>“How can something that doesn’t exist generate electricity?</p>
<p>“The cost of the Battery Project for carbon emissions it would save makes it more expensive than almost anything else that could be done.</p>
<p>“This Government’s focussed on everything energy except price and security. And surprise surprise we have high prices and low security.</p>
<p>“The lights went out last night in the Waikato and the Battery Project wasn’t there to save them. Megan Woods needs to say what she’s doing now to fix this?”</p>
<p><em>Written Parliamentary Question:</em></p>
<p><em>Portfolio: Energy and Resources (Hon Dr Megan Woods)</em></p>
<p><em>Question: Will the Government consider seeking commercial arrangements with gas suppliers to mitigate against the risk of energy shortages in a dry year?</em></p>
<p><em>Reply: The Government is considering a range of options to mitigate against the risk of energy shortages in a dry year through the NZ Battery project.</em></p>
