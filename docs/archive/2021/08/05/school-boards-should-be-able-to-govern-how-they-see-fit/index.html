<p>“ACT supports school boards to decide how to their run own schools without interference,” says ACT’s Education spokesperson Chris Baillie.</p>
<p>“If MacLeans College, or any other school decides that a student telling a teacher to f-off after refusing initial instructions does not reach their standards and they want to suspend them, they should be able to.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=UvCCd8GcsmKKe6vGMpaWv0KfkcZBvDkhfKBzSuQUUqcaZNTCvzp4p7WgQ2XGSoUA94pQMgI7DIW2CEARWdiqXAM2l0QqM-Af8mrIG_9_5bScpcj9nh_jT0PK9xLYM6DoxIbn_tQY-UW1bQ1K-2LdHx0Z-uneRFDJyQg9lfXWwuIpbIw9nVvxzX1A6tVgailGZ7A56-jLbusZES3fvPwwdw&e=1436fca17bda55074760909e04a8a403&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=school_boards_should_be&n=2">A decision from the Ombudsman</a> to make the school apologise will only embolden students.</p>
<p>“Just because this behaviour has become acceptable in other state schools, and some homes, doesn’t mean that schools should have to tolerate it.</p>
<p>“It’s not clear whether the student apologised after the incident or whether there was a history of bad behaviour.</p>
<p>“I was a teacher for 22 years. I know that nipping behaviour from students in the bud is important and if you don’t, it emboldens them.</p>
<p>“Anyone with an ounce of experience will know that kids will see this decision as the behaviour being condoned.</p>
<p>“While we don’t know all the details, on the face of it, this decision sets a terrible precedent and other school boards will be wondering whether they have any say at all in running their school.</p>
<p>“Teaching is a difficult enough job. We should be supporting teachers, and not just paying lip service. I really feel for school principals who have to deal with so much nonsense coming from this Government.”</p>
