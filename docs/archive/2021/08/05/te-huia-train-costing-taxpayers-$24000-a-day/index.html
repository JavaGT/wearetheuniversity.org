<p>Labour’s grand plan to have a commuter line between Hamilton to Auckland is racking up huge costs at the taxpayer’s expense, National’s Transport spokesperson Michael Woodhouse says.</p>
<p>Latest figures on the use of the train show passengers dropping to an average of 30 people per trip. With the train costing $25,932 per day to operate and revenue only at $1559, it is costing taxpayers more than $24,000 for every day the train runs.</p>
<p>“The Government claimed that it would take time for the number of people using the train to increase. Well time has passed and passenger numbers are only dropping.</p>
<p>“This is because it is simply not a service people can use. It doesn’t run at the right time, it doesn’t run at the right speed, and it doesn’t arrive at the right place.</p>
<p>“It is a huge waste of taxpayer money.</p>
<p>“It is quicker and more convenient for Kiwis to jump in their cars and drive, and that is what they are doing.</p>
<p>“This train is a clear example of how wasteful Labour is. It’s spending $785 million on a cycle bridge most people don’t want, it’s handed out $2.75 million to the Mongrel Mob and it’s paid $8 million for a motel to house the homeless.</p>
<p>“The Government shouldn’t be spending tens of thousands of dollars a day on a dumb idea.”</p>
