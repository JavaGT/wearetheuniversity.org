<p><strong>Friday, 6 August 2021, 5:35 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Peace_Action_Wellington">Peace Action Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>The French Embassy will be targeted for its ongoing role in the nuclear<br>poisoning of the Pacific by activists and artists following a day of<br>kōrero and art-making at the Newtown Community Centre starting at 1pm on<br>Saturday, 7th August.</p>
<p>“As we commemorate the horror of the first atomic bomb dropped on<br>Hiroshima, it is important to acknowledge that the impact of nuclear<br>weapons and the ongoing effects of militarism and colonial oppression in<br>Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa have not stopped. Neither has the resistance by<br>Pacific peoples,” says Peace Action member Valerie Morse.</p>
<p>Speakers at the event will include scholar and writer Dr. Emalani Case<br>whose book Everything Ancient Was Once New: Indigenous Persistence from<br>Hawaii to Kahiki was published by UH Press in 2021. Emalani is active<br>in the movement to demilitarise Hawai’i and stop RIMPAC, the biennial<br>war games held in Hawai’i, as well as standing up for a free and<br>independent Pacific</p>
<p>Indigenous Pacific Uprising (IPU) members Sina Brown-Davis and Tāwhana<br>Chadwick will speak about the situation in Tahiti. IPU works to connect,<br>amplify and uplift resistance and alternatives to colonial oppression in<br>the Pacific.</p>
<p>The free event will also involve making activist art together including<br>a banner expressing solidarity with the Ma’ohi Nui people and the recent<br>day of action in Tahiti when thousands took to the streets under the<br>slogan: Mai te Paura Ātōmī i te Tiāmara’a / From Bomb contamination to<br>self determination.</p>

<p>The Ma’ohi Nui people were contaminated by French nuclear testing in<br>1974 and are still demanding reparations more than 40 years later.</p>
<p>Sina Brown Davis says, “the IPU stands with our Te Ao Maohi cousins and<br>their fight for self-determination. Tahitian independence would have<br>ensured that France would not have poinsoned lands, waters and peoples<br>with their nuclear testing. There can be no Pacific liberation without<br>self determination. We must decolonise now.”</p>
<p>“We are continuing our commitment to ethical remembering and active<br>opposition of structures which colonise, extract, displace, and destroy<br>for profit, “ says Ms Morse. “While as a nation we have been firm in our<br>rejection of nuclear arms in our waters, we must look further ashore and<br>listen to the voices of self-determination in the Pacific and reject<br>militarism.”</p>
<p>The event will end at the French Embassy.</p>
