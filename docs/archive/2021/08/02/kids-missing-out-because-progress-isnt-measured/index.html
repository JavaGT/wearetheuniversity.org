<p><strong>Monday, 2 August 2021, 1:22 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Government must implement a standardised way to measure progress to make sure no children fall through the cracks, National’s Education spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>“If a child is falling through the cracks, then they’re missing out on all the opportunities a good education provides.</p>
<p>“We need a standardised measure of progress to identify those students who might need additional help and to make sure they get that help.</p>
<p>“Education Minister Chris Hipkins has previously insisted the curriculum provides these clear measures, but advice from his own officials doesn’t back that up.</p>
<p>“Labour abolished National Standards with no alternative or plan to measure student progress. We’re now in situation where we don’t know ‘when to worry’ about a student’s achievement.</p>
<p>“A ‘refreshed’ curriculum won’t be available until 2025 which means we’re at risk of a generation of students going through our school system missing out on the additional support or help they need and could’ve had if we had an adequate way to measure progress.</p>
<p>“It’s important parents know what goes on in the classroom. They deserve to know how well their child is doing and any areas they need to improve on to succeed.</p>
<p>“A good education can see children overcome some of the challenges they face purely because of the circumstances into which they were born.</p>
<p>“Our kids need to be able to foot it with the best in the world and that means being in the classroom regularly and being taught a world class curriculum. The Government just isn’t focused on these basics.”</p>
