<p><strong>Monday, 16 August 2021, 2:14 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>An award-winning University of Canterbury music student will be joined on stage by his mentor and professor when they tour the country with a new show over the next few weeks.Rakuto Kurano, 21, a violinist with the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra, will perform <em>DUPLEXITY</em> at venues from Auckland to Stewart Island.</p>
<p>He will be joined on the tour by Professor Mark Menzies, Head of Performance at the University of Canterbury. Professor Menzies, a violinist, violist, pianist, composer, and conductor, has been Kurano&#39;s mentor since 2017 and was his occasional co-performer at university events, where the pair have delighted audiences with their enthusiasm and virtuosic playing.   
 </p>
<p>“It’s an honour to have Mark join me on stage, and a real stamp of approval for this tour,” Kurano says.</p>
<p><em>DUPLEXITY</em> features three newly commissioned works by young New Zealand composers Liam Furey, Georgina Palmer and Robin Watson, as well as a new work by Kurano.  
 </p>
<p>“New Zealand has so many incredibly talented young composers, and I want to share their music across the country,” he says.   
 </p>
<p>Also on the programme are familiar works by composers such as Brahms, Schumann and Piazzolla.   
 </p>
<p>Originally from Japan, Kurano has established himself in Aotearoa New Zealand as a versatile violinist, violist, pianist, composer and conductor. He graduated with a Bachelor of Music in Performance and Composition from the University of Canterbury last year and continued with an honours degree this year.

<p>Kurano already has a long list of performing credits to his name in New Zealand, Vietnam and Japan. Awards include the Lilburn Trust Award in 2020 for the composition <em>Alien Abduction Suite</em>, the 2019 NZTrio composing competition for <em>Fantail in Tokyo</em> and NZ Harp Duo composition competition wins in 2016 and 2017.

In January 2021, the Baroque Music Community and Educational Trust of New Zealand commissioned him to compose a 15-minute <em>Concerto Grosso</em> for their 2021 Baroque summer workshop and tour. The work was the final piece in the programme on the 11-concert tour and was met with numerous standing ovations. Peter Mechen called it a “splendid work” in a review for Middle-C.
