<p><strong>Wednesday, 16 June 2021, 4:36 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Introducing debt-to-income limits won’t do anything to address the supply problem that is fuelling the country’s housing shortage, National’s Shadow Treasurer Andrew Bayly says.</p>
<p>“This is more tinkering around the edges from Labour, which should be prioritising initiatives that will actually get more houses built.</p>
<p>“National has, for months, been calling for emergency housing powers to be introduced similar to those used after the Canterbury earthquakes.</p>
<p>“We have draft legislation ready to go that would short-circuit the RMA and incentivise councils to build supporting infrastructure by offering $50,000 for every extra dwelling they consent above their historical average.</p>
<p>“Labour could pick up this legislation today and the get the ball rolling on meaningful help for first-home buyers, but it appears more interested in waging war with investors.</p>
<p>“Trying to kill off demand with blunt tools like DTI limits, without addressing the housing supply problem, will simply lock thousands of Kiwis out of the market unnecessarily.</p>
<p>“While the concept of a debt serviceability restrictions may have a place if excessive risk-taking by banks was posing a threat to financial stability, but it’s unclear that is the case. In fact, retail banks are already conservative in their lending practices.</p>
<p>“National is very concerned that first-home buyers will still be disadvantaged. The Government needs to provide more detail about what these restrictions will look like.</p>
<p>“It looks like an admission of failure after his plan to dress up a capital gains tax as a bright-line test extension and remove interest deductibility did little to cool the housing market.”</p>
