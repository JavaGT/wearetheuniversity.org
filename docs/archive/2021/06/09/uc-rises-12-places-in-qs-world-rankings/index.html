<p>The University of Canterbury (UC) has improved its global rank among the world’s universities, rising 12 places in the latest QS World University Rankings released today.</p>
<p>UC is one of the few universities of New Zealand’s eight QS-ranked institutions to rise in the 2022 global list - climbing from 270 in the 2021 rankings to 258.</p>
<p>Tumu Tuarua Rangahau | Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research, Professor Ian Wright, says it is pleasing to see the University moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>“This result is due to a concerted effort across the entire University in the last couple of years, and it is gratifying to see this effort has the University moving in a positive direction.”</p>
<p>“I would especially like to acknowledge the hard work of our world-class academics and researchers who deliver quality education and create research that is responding to a changing world,” Professor Wright says.</p>
<p>The recent results also showed an improvement in the Employer Reputation indicator – measuring how employers regard UC graduates.</p>
<p>Endless opportunities are available outside traditional learning at UC, giving our students the chance to find themselves and connect with others, and ready them to positively contribute to a changing world.</p>
