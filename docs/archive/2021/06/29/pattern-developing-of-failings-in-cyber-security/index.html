<p><strong>Tuesday, 29 June 2021, 3:38 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>ACT’s Health spokesperson Brooke van Velden Party has today successful triggered an urgent debate in Parliament about the cyber security breaches at Waikato Hospital.</p>
<p>It follows documents from Waikato District Health Board being released onto the dark web after the ransomware attack that crippled five hospitals&#39; IT systems in May.</p>
<p>“What’s happened at Waikato is not the first cyber security breach that has impacted the government and has impacted public trust,” says Ms van Velden.</p>
<p>“The pattern was first seen in the Reserve Bank attack and then the NZX in February.</p>
<p>“This pattern is quickly eroding trust in government to get it right and keep data secure</p>
<p>“If something is not done to secure our critical infrastructure this will cause long term damage to public confidence</p>
<p>“This also has a significant impact on businesses confidences as overseas businesses will not come and invest in New Zealand if this pattern continues in the way it has been.</p>
<p>“We need better reporting systems on cyber security threats to keep New Zealanders safe.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.act.org.nz/health-policy?e=1436fca17bda55074760909e04a8a403&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pattern_developing&n=2">ACT’s health policies</a> include a national integrated IT system across the public healthcare system.</p>
<p>“We would engage the private sector to help develop the best possible defence against cyber-attacks, look overseas and base our cyber security systems on world-leading countries to ensure New Zealanders can have confidence that their private data is protected.</p>
<p>“New Zealanders deserve peace of mind when it comes to their private information.”</p>
