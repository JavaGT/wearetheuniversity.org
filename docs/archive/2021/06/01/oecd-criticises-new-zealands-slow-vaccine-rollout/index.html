<p><strong>Tuesday, 1 June 2021, 11:21 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The OECD’s criticism of our slow vaccine rollout should serve as a grim warning to the Government that it needs to pick up the pace, National’s Covid-19 Response spokesperson Chris Bishop says.</p>
<p>New Zealand has the second slowest Covid-19 vaccine rollout in the OECD and ranked 115th in the world.</p>
<p>“Victoria’s latest lockdown demonstrates precisely why New Zealand needs to get on with vaccinating as many people as possible, as quickly as possible,” Mr Bishop says.</p>
<p>“We were promised by Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins we would be at the front of the queue for vaccines, instead we are at the back.</p>
<p>“The OECD’s forecasts for New Zealand assume our border will open fully by early next year, which seems heroic given how slow our rollout is to date.</p>
<p>“What’s more likely is that the opening of our border will be pushed back due to a significant delay in vaccinating our population.</p>
<p>“It’s clear our vaccine rollout is a shambles.</p>
<p>“The Government attempted to quietly move the goalposts back for when Group 3 and Group 4 vaccinations would start, the national booking system has been delayed by a month, and DHBs don’t even know which of their staff have been vaccinated and which haven’t.</p>
<p>“The vaccine rollout is critical for opening New Zealand up to the rest of the world. The Government must get this right.”</p>
