<p><strong>Monday, 7 June 2021, 3:28 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology">Auckland University of Technology</a></strong></p>
<p>The latest monthly estimate from the Unemployment Rate – Nowcast (UR-NOW) model has the unemployment rate steady on 4.7 per cent.</p>
<p>The May figure has been released by the Centre for Social Data Analytics at the Auckland University of Technology.</p>
<p>The UR-NOW model makes a monthly prediction of what the quarterly unemployment rate will be, using benefits and job data.</p>
<p>The estimates are designed to signal likely official quarterly unemployment rates and give an early warning of changes in labour market and economic conditions.</p>
<p>The official unemployment rate is based on Stats NZ’s Household Labour Force Survey over a three-month period, so there is a natural delay of up to four months while that information is collected, analysed and published.</p>
<p>AUT Professor Tim Maloney, also Chief Economist at the Ministry for Social Development built the UR-NOW tool with David Rea, a Principal Advisor at the Ministry of Social Development.</p>
<p>“Using data from April and May, we estimate that the unemployment rate for Quarter 2 (April-June 2021) is tracking at 4.7 per cent,” Professor Maloney says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This figure is only slightly higher than our first estimate for Quarter 2, of 4.6 per cent, and identical to the official unemployment rate for Quarter 1 (Jan-March 2021) of 4.7 per cent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“This suggests that the unemployment rate has stabilised for now at around the 4.7 per cent level and allays concerns that the labour market may have deteriorated recently as a result of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.”</p>

<p>The final UR-NOW estimate for Quarter 2 will be released in the first week of July, with the official unemployment rate for Quarter 2 due to be released by Statistics New Zealand in the first week of August.</p>
<p>UR-NOW predictions appear on this page of the Centre for Social Data Analytics at AUT, usually at the end of the week after the month finishes.</p>
