<p><strong>Friday, 19 March 2021, 10:10 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“No amount of sensible advice to the contrary will stand in the way of Labour’s dogma that there isn’t a problem you can’t tax your way out of,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that a big part of Labour’s upcoming series of silver bullets for the housing crisis will be some form of increased land and property taxes.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=aDRdpDfXeI8Gdrzycx2wwm6wjMnrDuIuT-3QAWGUpGNuk_LCthlRYK3xEdIS4cmsEux1C6S0uxOx0x3shmayWAShLL14L9qW64gdzN6S4JNFm3gu-SwJxqCritqxJv85nfaiCOohoDfkjIplCKm9tSdqMdcdmsVjblm2YIOdtl3e8ubJzGAuPEg7JjRur9pcJ7BlyzAaAg8R8Nm_razaxg&e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=stand_by_for_more_du&n=2">Answers to Written Parliamentary Questions from ACT</a> show Grant Robertson saying he has received briefings from officials since December on demand side measures that include ‘vacant land taxes.’</p>
<p>“Add that to his earlier confirmation that he’s considering extending the bright line tax on selling investment property from five to 10 years – which is a capital gains tax by stealth – and it’s clear Labour hopes to tax its way out of the housing crisis.</p>
<p>“This is despite clear evidence these ‘demand side’ measures don’t work.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.act.org.nz/r?u=dsUbxyaUqYE7WH3777clB2dcYwSWRCUTn2JHZkcusXRZHXeg9UMSNTMNro3KyjbBrvm-4Xod3Lceqakn1RBumwy2tNFMFr3j0HJIGlejlhI&e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=stand_by_for_more_du&n=3">The New Zealand Initiative released a report on this last month</a>. They ran the numbers and concluded ‘the focus on demand-side measures has been a failure.’</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly simple – you can’t live in a tax. How far can you extend the bright line before it disappears? Only building more houses will alleviate the housing crisis.</p>
<p>“We’ve already seen this in action in New Zealand. The emergency measures taken following the Canterbury earthquakes proved that mass, fast-track consenting of land is a key component to getting houses built and alleviating property price inflation.</p>
<p>“The other two components of tackling the housing crisis are infrastructure and the buildings themselves.</p>
<p>“ACT has been advocating making both things simpler with a root and branch replacement of the Resource Management Act – which the Government has declined to do, instead proposing to replace one cumbersome Act with three. This isn’t going to speed anything up.</p>
<p>“We’ve also said GST on new builds should be shared with local authorities to help fund infrastructure.</p>
<p>“None of this appears to be on the table. Instead the Government continues to obsess itself with taxes, grants, lending restrictions and overseas buyers – anything but making it easier to build the new homes New Zealanders desperately need.”</p>
