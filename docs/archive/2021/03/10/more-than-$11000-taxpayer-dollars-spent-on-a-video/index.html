<p><strong>Wednesday, 10 March 2021, 4:04 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Housing Minister must justify spending more than $11,000 on promotional videos for a housing scheme that has only benefited 12 families, National’s Housing spokesperson Nicola Willis says.</p>
<p>“It was bad enough that the Minister mocked New Zealanders with a video promoting a ‘game changer’ housing policy that has only benefited a lucky dozen families.</p>
<p>“We now know the video cost thousands of dollars to produce, and Kiwis paid the bill.”</p>
<p>Answers to written questions show the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development employed a specialist videographer to create the video, including editing in a guest-starring role for Megan Woods and $300 worth of drone footage.</p>
<p>“Many New Zealanders will be rightly concerned about the value taxpayers are getting from this scheme that has only benefited a handful of people,” Ms Willis says.</p>
<p>“The Minister now admits the scheme is costing an average of $235,000 per family. This is nice if you can get it, but the vast majority of Kiwis never will.</p>
<p>“We’ve also discovered that Government agencies are employing more than 11 full-time equivalent employees to work on the scheme.</p>
<p>“To say such a scheme is a game changer will be a difficult pill for the thousands of people on the public housing wait list, or the thousands of young Kiwis struggling to get into a home.</p>
<p>“Rather than spending time and money on hollow PR, the Government should focus its efforts on delivering substantive policies that will make a difference to the tens of thousands of Kiwis locked out of home ownership.”</p>
