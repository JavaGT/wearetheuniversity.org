<p>In reaction to the news today that Police are putting photographs and details of innocent young people into a national database, AUT Associate Professor Camille Nakhid says:</p>
<p>“The hyper-criminalization of our Māori youth and youth of colour through the photographing of innocent youth conflicts with Police Commissioner Andrew Coster’s comment that the New Zealand Police ‘police by consent’.</p>
<p>“If healthy relationships, free of discrimination and fear are to take place between the Police and Māori, the incessant surveillance of our young people of colour needs to stop.</p>
<p>“The behaviour of the police stems from an ingrained belief that Māori and other people of colour are criminals or have criminal intent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The police need to be reminded that when they colonized Aotearoa and brought over their British laws almost two centuries ago to supersede Māori laws, there was not a single prison and not a single Māori in prison.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“If they want to police by consent, New Zealand police first need to understand what consent means.</p>
<p>“Otherwise, it is just plain intimidation on their part and a revival of colonialism’s beliefs and practices.”</p>
