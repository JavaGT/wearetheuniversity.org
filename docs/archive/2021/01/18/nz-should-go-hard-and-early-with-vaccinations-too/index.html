<p><strong>Monday, 18 January 2021, 12:00 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Government has claimed New Zealand’s successful response to Covid-19 thus far has been because we went hard and early, so why has the message changed for vaccinations, Leader of the Opposition Judith Collins says.</p>
<p>“The Government has said manufacturers are focused on sending vaccinations to countries where thousands of people are dying every day, pushing New Zealand further down the queue.</p>
<p>“But that argument doesn’t wash when Singapore, who last recorded a Covid-19 death in November, has already begun vaccinating border workers.</p>
<p>“At the very least our Government should be making sure our frontline workers are vaccinated immediately, providing another layer of defence at our border.</p>
<p>“Vaccinating our border workers should be an immediate priority given how easily transmissible the new Covid variants are.</p>
<p>“The Government can’t afford to be complacent given the seriousness of the situation. We should be going hard and going early with vaccinating our border workers too.”</p>
