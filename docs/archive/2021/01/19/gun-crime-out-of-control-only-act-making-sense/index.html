<p>“Another week and New Zealand’s months-long spate of gun crime continues,” says ACT Firearms Reform spokesperson Nicole McKee.</p>
<p>“Much of this violent activity is gang-related, using illegal firearms.</p>
<p>“The Government simply doesn’t have a plan to address it – only ACT does.</p>
<p>“Last week it was arming Police in Canterbury because of expected gang retribution.</p>
<p>“Today we’ve got drive-by shootings in Auckland and properties being sprayed with shotgun pellets in Wellington, but still the Government is completely silent on this long-term pattern.</p>

<p>“Innocent bystanders will be killed soon. It’s only a matter of time.</p>
<p>“We need to make criminals aware that if they continue to behave this way the penalties will destroy their way of life.</p>
<p>“The Police need to be able to go in and disrupt this insidious industry, <a href="https://www.act.org.nz/govt_must_strip_gangs_of_gun_licences?e=154c02be5f7fc7dc73d854cf1d9225ee&utm_source=actnz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=more_gun_crime&n=3">including stripping known members on the National Gang List of their firearms licenses</a>, which is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>“The Government is still on holiday, but the gangs have never been busier.</p>
<p>“I once again call on the Government to pick up ACT’s constructive policies to tackling some of New Zealand’s longest term and most difficult problems.</p>
