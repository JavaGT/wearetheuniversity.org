<p><strong>Wednesday, 27 October 2021, 2:27 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Government is wrong to keep most children out of school in Auckland until 15 November at the earliest, National’s Education spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>“The “plan” announced today is a vague suggestion that primary and intermediate schools might begin to open on 15 November, and no plan at all for years 9 and 10 – critical years of early adolescence when learning habits are formed.</p>
<p>“Keeping kids out of school in Auckland for so long is doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>“Auckland’s kids have become the collateral damage from our slow vaccination uptake and the Government’s utter failure to plan and prepare for the Delta outbreak.</p>
<p>“After two months out of the classroom, more and more students are disengaging, and with each passing week we are losing more kids from the education system.</p>
<p>“With only three out of five students in New Zealand attending school regularly at the best of times, we cannot sustain further disruption and loss of momentum.</p>
<p>“While many schools have put a huge effort into online learning, for far too many students it is just not working.</p>
<p>“Some parents and students will worry about the risks of returning during an outbreak, especially for the unvaccinated under-12s, but my sense is that far more parents and students are worried about the risk of not returning – the loss of interest and enthusiasm, the loneliness, the mental strain.</p>
<p>“The Government is misguided in being ultra-cautious in reopening schools. Waiting for nearly everyone to get around to getting vaccinated is too slow.</p>
<p>“We need more urgency on this important issue.”</p>
