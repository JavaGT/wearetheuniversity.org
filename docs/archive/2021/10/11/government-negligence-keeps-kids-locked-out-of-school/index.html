<p>The Government’s lack of preparedness is the reason students are missing out on even more critical school time, says National’s Education spokesperson Paul Goldsmith.</p>
<p>“It has been known for months that Delta is transmissible in the school environment.</p>
<p>“Yet the Government didn’t make the necessary preparations, including maximising vaccine uptake among teachers, to make sure schools could reopen for term four.</p>
<p>“This situation was entirely predictable and proves the Government is incapable of thinking ahead.</p>
<p>“The Government did not even know which and how many teachers were vaccinated. A Government that was determined to prioritise children’s education would have taken a basic step like this.</p>
<p>“An opportunity was missed to drive and encourage vaccination uptake among teachers when Delta first emerged earlier in the year.</p>
<p>“For students sitting NCEA and other exams, this is another real blow at a time when they desperately need face-to-face time with teachers.</p>
<p>“But throughout the whole education system greater direction is needed to ensure students receive a minimum standard of education.</p>
<p>“Online learning is variable and risks intensifying educational inequities.</p>
<p>“The quality of education a student receives in lockdown should not be a lottery.</p>
<p>“Well before now, the Government should’ve taken the actions required for schools to safely reopen for term four.</p>
<p>“It’s vital that this week is used to fast-track the reopening of schools - vaccination centres on schools grounds and the use of rapid antigen tests by teachers are key measures the Government must consider.</p>
<p>“New Zealand cannot allow Labour’s negligence to further jeopardise the educational progress and wellbeing of children.”</p>
