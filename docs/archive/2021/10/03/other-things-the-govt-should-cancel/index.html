<p><strong>Sunday, 3 October 2021, 6:52 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“After the Government proved yesterday it is capable of listening to New Zealanders by scrapping the cycle bridge, ACT has a list of other things Labour should back down on,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“The Government has too many policies that divide people and divide wealth. It should dump them. Instead we need policies that unite New Zealand behind good ideas to create wealth.</p>
<p>“It’s ok to admit when you get things wrong. So here are some other divisive policies the Government should dump:</p>
<p>• Three Waters Reforms, complexity and division with questionable benefits</p>
<p>• Fair Pay Agreements, compulsory unionism that will kill productivity growth</p>
<p>• Parent Teacher interview leave, forcing another cost on employers</p>
<p>• Another public holiday, paid for by employers</p>
<p>• Scrapping interest deductibility on property investors mortgages</p>
<p>• The COVID eradication response, failing despite the Government’s denials</p>
<p>• Firearms reforms, alienated licenced firearm owners but did nothing for gun crime</p>
<p>• Zero Carbon Act, an overcomplicated way of reducing emissions</p>
<p>• Commercial property law changes, shaking confidence in the rule of law</p>
<p>• Significant Natural Areas, confiscation for improving your property</p>
<p>• Live Export Ban, an enormous economic cost based on faulty assumptions</p>
<p>• Car Tax, impractical, inequitable, and won’t reduce carbon emissions on gram</p>
<p>• Oil &amp; gas ban, destroying investor confidence in New Zealand</p>
<p>• National Policy Statement on Freshwater, one-size-fits all and practical nowhere.</p>
<p>“Those are just a few examples where the Government should listen to New Zealanders, back down from its ideological stance and do what’s right.</p>
<p>“ACT has plenty of positive policies the Government can replace these with, including:</p>
<p>• An Epidemic Response Unit to govern the response to COVID professionally and collaboratively</p>
<p>• Student Education Accounts, so parents are in charge of the education budget</p>
<p>• 30 year infrastructure funding and planning partnerships to get infrastructure built in each region</p>
<p>• Private insurance on new builds instead of costly council building inspections and get homes built</p>
<p>• A Regulatory Responsibility Act to ensure law making consults and considers peoples’ rights</p>
<p>• A Mental Health and Addictions agency to ensure the mental health dollar is efficiently spent</p>
<p>• ACT’s alternative budget would cut taxes, and start repaying debt by 2025</p>
<p>• Electronic income management for welfare, so the kids get the benefits</p>
<p>• Gang injunction orders and tougher asset forfeiture laws, so organised crime doesn’t pay</p>
<p>• A four year term with independent select committees, so law making is sober and considered instead of rushed and reckless</p>
<p>• A straightforward climate policy that links our emission levels to our competitors’</p>
<p>“We’d like to congratulate the Labour for scrapping the bridge, now to quote Jacinda Ardern- “let’s keep moving.”</p>
