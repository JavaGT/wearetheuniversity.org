<p>“Jacinda Ardern chose to meet with a team of her spin doctors instead of meeting with the organisers of the Groundswell protest,” says ACT’s Primary Industries spokesperson Mark Cameron.</p>
<p>“Thousands of people from rural New Zealand protested against the Government in July after a raft of regulations have been piled on them.</p>
<p>“The organisers of the protest wrote to Jacinda Ardern asking if she would time to meet with them after 10am on the 12th of August.</p>
<p>“Her office responded saying she had “a prior diary commitment.”</p>
<p>“It turns out there was nothing in her diary for large chunks of time that day and one the commitments was a meeting with her spin doctors.</p>
<p>“The organisers of the Groundswell Protest have raised legitimate concerns about the issues facing rural New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Rural New Zealand has become a punching bag for the Government. They’ve taken blow after blow as a raft of new regulations shows just what this Government really thinks about the primary sector.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s freshwater and winter grazing, a ban on live exports, Significant Natural Areas, indigenous biodiversity or a tax on utes, Three Waters, rural New Zealand has taken a hammering.</p>
<p>“All 10 ACT MPs attended protests around New Zealand, and we will show our support for future protests.</p>
<p>“The organisers of Groundswell deserve an explanation from Jacinda Ardern about why she wouldn’t meet with them. They have requested another meeting next week and I implore the Prime Minister to finally start listening.&quot;</p>
<p>A copy of the Prime Minister&#39;s diary on the day the meeting was requested can be found below.</p>
