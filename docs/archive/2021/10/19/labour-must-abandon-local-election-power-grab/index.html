<p><strong>Tuesday, 19 October 2021, 4:05 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>It’s promising that Chris Hipkins has listened to National’s concerns over an electoral power grab buried in a Covid-19 bill, National’s Local Government spokesperson Christopher Luxon says.</p>
<p>“The Government is proposing to give itself the power to repeatedly delay local body elections through a change hidden quietly in the <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_116000/covid-19-response-management-measures-legislation-bill">COVID-19 Response (Management Measures) Legislation Bill</a>.</p>
<p>“This bill allows the Government to adjourn local elections multiple times without constraint – and not just in an election year, but the year after as well.</p>
<p>“As an example, it would let the Government delay one of next year’s council elections by six weeks at a time, right through to the end of 2023.</p>
<p>“The apparent reason for this draconian change is so local elections can be more flexibly managed during a pandemic – forgetting that both the Government and councils already have flexibility around elections, and despite the Government’s proclaimed commitment to ending lockdowns, which calls the need for this change into question.</p>
<p>“Labour has failed to explain why this power is being pre-emptively granted now, rather than next year if it were clearly needed then.</p>
<p>“If the Government is serious about meeting vaccination targets and opening up the country, this power is even harder to fathom.</p>

<p>“What’s more, this is a permanent change without a sunset clause, or expiry date – meaning it applies not just to the 2022 elections, but to local body elections into the future.</p>
<p>“It’s inconceivable Labour are using a sweeping Covid bill, being rammed through Parliament under a shortened timeframe, with almost no proper public consultation, to make an enduring electoral change.</p>
<p>“This is lawmaking at its absolute worst.</p>
<p>“However, we’re cautiously optimistic about Minister Hipkins’ quiet admission today that he has heard National’s concerns, and will be taking an amendment to Parliament next week.</p>
<p>“The electoral changes should have never been included in the bill in the first place. The Government’s amendment should do nothing less than remove them altogether.</p>
<p>“Hopefully the Government’s sudden reversal is a sign it will do the same on its Three Waters asset grab plan, and listen to the tens of thousands of New Zealanders demanding that it be dumped – but we won’t hold out much hope.”</p>
