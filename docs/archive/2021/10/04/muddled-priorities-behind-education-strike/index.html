<p><strong>Monday, 4 October 2021, 11:50 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Government’s confused spending priorities in education have created the conditions for the planned strike by Ministry of Education psychologists, National’s Education spokesperson Paul Goldsmith says.</p>
<p>“Every school has been reporting the pressure that has been building in dealing with students with learning or behavioural difficulties.</p>
<p>“There just aren’t enough resources to deal with the scale of the problem.</p>
<p>“But for all its talk about supporting children, this Government has prioritised $700 million over the next four years for a loosely targeted free school lunches programme.</p>
<p>“Everyone likes a free lunch, and for a small group it may be justified, but it is a warped priority especially given the pressures in our education system elsewhere.</p>
<p>“We have kids not turning up, our maths education is a mess and we have no robust measurement of progress for whether children are learning or not.</p>
<p>“The Government needs to start paying more attention to what’s happening in our schools.”</p>
