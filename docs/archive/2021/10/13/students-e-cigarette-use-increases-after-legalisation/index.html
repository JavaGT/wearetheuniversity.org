<p><strong>Wednesday, 13 October 2021, 1:16 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury">University of Canterbury</a></strong></p>
<p>Students are vaping more since nicotine-containing e-cigarettes became legal in New Zealand in 2018, a research team led by University of Canterbury Health Sciences Adjunct Fellow Dr Ben Wamamili has found.</p>
<p>1,932 students were surveyed in March 2018, just before nicotine-containing e-cigarettes became legal, and 2,004 students were surveyed one year later in March 2019, across all of Aotearoa’s universities.</p>
<p>Dr Wamamili’s team found that 13.5% of students were vaping in 2019 compared to 6.8% before it was legal. Slightly more students were smoking regular cigarettes in 2019 (12.1%) than in 2018 (10.6%).</p>
<p>The results were unexpected.</p>
<p>“Yes, we were surprised by a significant increase in students who vaped in 2019 without a corresponding decrease in students who smoked cigarettes,” Dr Wamamili says. “This suggests that students are not necessarily turning to vaping as a way to give up cigarette smoking.”</p>
<p>Another startling find was that more students seem to be vaping – illegally - in smoke-free spaces. “The apparent increase in students vaping in smoke-free spaces is of great concern. If vaping in smoke-free spaces became widespread and led to increased tobacco smoking in these spaces, this would be a source of considerable harm to public health.”</p>
<p>Students were also less likely to perceive e-cigarettes as less harmful than tobacco after they were widely available. “There was a significant decrease, of 3.1%, in students who perceived e-cigarettes as less harmful than tobacco cigarettes in 2019 compared with 2018. The Ministry of Health encourages smokers to use e-cigarettes for tobacco cessation,” Dr Wamamili says.</p>

<p>The issues can be addressed with better education and possibly by using technology, he says. “Education and health promotion strategies including compliance with the smoke-free legislation is a good starting point. Technologies such as mobile phone apps could also be harnessed by health providers to provide accurate and reliable information about vaping.”</p>
<p>Dr Wamamili’s research paper <em>Cigarette smoking and e-cigarette use among university students in New Zealand before and after nicotine-containing e-cigarettes became widely available: results from repeat cross-sectional surveys</em> was published in the <em>New Zealand Medical Journal</em> on 8 October. It was co-authored by the University of Canterbury’s Professor Randolph Grace, School of Psychology, Speech and Hearing, and Pat Coope, who recently retired from the College of Education, Health and Human Development.</p>
<p>New Zealand aims to become a smoke-free nation by the year 2025; the Government began working toward this goal in 2011.</p>
