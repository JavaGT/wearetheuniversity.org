<p><strong>Wednesday, 20 October 2021, 1:53 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>The Government is wrong to keep most children out of school in Auckland, possibly for the rest of the year, National’s Education spokesperson Paul Goldsmith said today.</p>
<p>“While we welcome a return of senior students, the risks of continuing to deny 5-14 year-olds a proper education outweigh the risks of returning.</p>
<p>“Auckland’s kids have become the collateral damage from our slow vaccination uptake and poor Government planning.</p>
<p>“After two months out of the classroom, more and more students are disengaging, and this has the potential to blight the prospects of tens of thousands of kids.</p>
<p>“With only three out of five kids in New Zealand attending school regularly at the best of times, we cannot sustain further disruption and loss of momentum.</p>
<p>“While many schools have put a huge effort into online learning, for far too many students it is just not working.</p>
<p>“Some parents and students will worry about the risks of returning during an outbreak, especially for the unvaccinated under-12s, but my sense is that far more parents and students are worried about the risk of not returning – the loss of interest and enthusiasm, the loneliness, the mental strain.</p>
<p>“The Government is misguided in being ultra-cautious in reopening schools. Waiting for nearly everyone to get around to getting vaccinated is too slow.</p>
<p>“Ensure the teachers are vaccinated, open the windows, put on the masks and get on with it.</p>
<p>“Keeping kids out of schools for longer is doing more harm than good.”</p>
