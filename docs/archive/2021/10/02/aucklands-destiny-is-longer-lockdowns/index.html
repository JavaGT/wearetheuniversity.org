<p>“Anti-lockdown protests in Auckland are insulting law abiding Aucklanders. We may end up locked down longer because an anti-lockdown protest spreads COVID” says ACT Leader and Epsom MP David Seymour.</p>
<p>“Our largest city has been locked down nearly seven weeks. Now a selfish minority may make it worse for the majority, and I bet they’re too simple to see the irony.</p>
<p>“The Government has to take some responsibility, too. This unrest will only grow if the Government itself doesn’t start telling the truth and offering a plan. This lockdown isn’t working and we need a new plan, but the Government has its head in the sand.</p>
<p>“At Alert Level 3, travel is restricted and only allowed for permitted movement in your local area.</p>
<p>“Today’s protest was beside the Epsom electorate. I’ve never met a Destiny supporter in Epsom. In our community, the Christian teaching is selflessness. Brian Tamaki’s stunt is not Christian, it is the ultimate in selfishness.</p>
<p>“ACT supports the rule of law, the Government should enforce clear rules for everyone without fear or favour.</p>
<p>“Yesterday, we revealed a man with gang links was allowed to isolated at home and repeatedly break the rules.</p>
<p>“We’ve also seen dozens of gang members break the rules to attend funeral precessions.</p>
<p>“Today, thousands have taken to the streets with no repercussions. COVID Response Minister Chris Hipkins needs to explain how a small few are able to get away with endangering many.”</p>
