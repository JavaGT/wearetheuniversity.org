<p>The Government must provide a date and plan for Auckland schools to reopen now, says National’s Education spokesperson Paul Goldsmith.</p>
<p>“As kids throughout the country get back to the classroom on Monday, students in Auckland continue to miss out on critical classroom time as lockdown drags on. The Government hasn’t set a pathway for returning to school.</p>
<p>“Worse still, the Government has no idea how much time students spend actually engaged in online learning. Hundreds of schools have stopped submitting attendance data.</p>
<p>“One principal has described on line learning as ‘a joke’; another admits 40 per cent of students log in ‘on a good day’.</p>
<p>“Our truancy and attendance challenges are only worsened by prolonged periods of missed class time.</p>
<p>“Many senior students are worried about what will happen if they cannot sit exams.</p>
<p>“For a Government allegedly concerned about well-being, the sluggishness to provide a plan for reopening schools is causing anxiety for students – and their parents.</p>
<p>“Students and parents deserve to know when schools will reopen, or at least have the conditions required for reopening spelled out.</p>
<p>“If schools can demonstrate their staff are double-vaccinated, why can’t they reopen now with sensible precautions?</p>
<p>“The Government’s slow vaccination rollout left New Zealand ill-prepared, but their complacency about the impact of lockdowns on education time risks devastating long-term harms for a generation of students.”</p>
