<p><strong>Thursday, 28 October 2021, 8:33 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National has forced the Government to back down on an electoral power grab buried in a Covid bill.</p>
<p>“The Government proposed to give itself the power to repeatedly delay local body elections through a change hidden quietly in the Covid Response (Management Measures) Legislation Bill,” says National’s Local Government spokesperson Christopher Luxon.</p>
<p>“The bill allowed the Government to adjourn local elections multiple times without constraint – and not just in an election year, but the year after as well.</p>
<p>“As an example, it would have let the Government delay one of next year’s council elections by six weeks at a time, right through to the end of 2023.</p>
<p>“The Government has now buckled under the pressure and will delete that clause from the bill.</p>
<p>“The apparent reason for this draconian change was so local elections can be more flexibly managed during a pandemic – forgetting that both the Government and councils already have flexibility around elections.”</p>
<p>Covid Response spokesman Chris Bishop says it is ridiculous that electoral changes were included in the bill in the first place.</p>
<p>“We argued it was outrageous Labour would use a sweeping Covid bill, being rammed through Parliament under a shortened timeframe, with almost no proper public consultation, to make an enduring electoral change.</p>
<p>“Hopefully the Government’s sudden reversal is a sign they’ll do the same on its Three Waters asset grab plan, and listen to the tens of thousands of New Zealanders demanding that it be dumped – but we won’t hold out much hope.”</p>
