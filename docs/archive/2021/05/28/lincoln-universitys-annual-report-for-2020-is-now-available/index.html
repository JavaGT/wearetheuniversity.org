<p><strong>Friday, 28 May 2021, 10:40 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>The 2020 Annual Report provides information on the University’s financial and service performance and importantly the progress it has made towards its strategic goals.</p>
<p>The University’s Strategy 2019-2028 has been particularly significant following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, as it has provided a robust framework, balancing the here and now with a long-term view. It remains the key driver for the University’s growth, financial sustainability and ultimate realisation of its vision.</p>
<p>Despite COVID-19 impacts and the reduction in numbers of international students, new domestic student enrolments increased by 7.4% in 2020, and the University ended the year only 8.3% less than its pre-COVID target. The notable increase in domestic student numbers can be attributed to the University’s nimble ability to move swiftly in a profoundly altered COVID-19 employment market, removing barriers for students to study, and providing a range of options to meet the needs of the thriving food and fibre sector for skilled and qualified graduates.</p>
<p>Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Bruce McKenzie says that the University was proud of its role in supporting New Zealand’s economic and environmental recovery in a COVID-19-impacted world.</p>
<p>“Our commitment to the Māori economy continues through the development of trained and skilled thought leaders, supporting the performance and growth of Māori assets.”</p>

<p>Lincoln’s financial performance in 2020 was very satisfactory. Earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to revenue was 10.8% and its cash cover 61.3%. New cost-savings initiatives were implemented early in the year in consultation with staff, to ensure the University’s financial viability in 2020. These cost-saving initiatives contributed significantly towards offsetting the adverse impact of the pandemic on its revenue.</p>
<p>Professor Bruce McKenzie says that throughout this year of unprecedented challenges including fluctuating between alert levels, academic staff persevered in providing teaching and research of the very highest quality and a student experience exemplifying the University’s value of Manaakitaka.</p>
<p>“Our unique contribution to research continued, and the University remains intimately connected to the quality of our research programmes and their application to real-world problems.</p>
<p>“I am deeply proud of how all our Lincoln University whānau rose to the challenges that confronted them in a year like no other.”</p>
<p>Ministerial endorsement for the University’s new science facilities&#39; Single Stage Business Case and the release of funding to progress the construction provided a welcome boost for the Campus Development Programme.</p>
<p>“We also received an allocation of $4.6 million from the Government’s $200m Clean Powered Public Service Fund, allowing us to begin converting our fossil fuel-powered steam heating network to 100% electric and to decommission and demolish our boiler plant and stack by mid-2024,” said Professor McKenzie.</p>
<p>Lincoln remains committed to building collaborative partnerships with other universities and research providers, industry, private enterprises and iwi to achieve innovative solutions to some of the world’s most pressing land-based challenges.</p>
