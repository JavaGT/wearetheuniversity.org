<p><strong>Saturday, 29 May 2021, 6:19 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand">ACT New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>“Public libraries should be a place for all members of the community and public events shouldn’t be shut down because of political agendas,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“This week both Dunedin and Christchurch Libraries have cancelled events by the group ‘Speak up for Women.’ This group wants to have a public discussion about amendments to the Births, Deaths and Marriages Bill.</p>
<p>&quot;In a democracy, councils are accountable to the people, not the other way around. We don&#39;t pay our rates for councils to censor our thoughts.</p>
<p>“This is the same group that was cancelled from speaking at Massey University. At the time I said “There is a growing danger of taxpayer-funded universities abusing their health and safety obligations in order to ‘deplatform’ speakers whom small groups of vocal activists find controversial.”</p>
<p>“Sadly, it’s not just taxpayer funded universities who have conformed to cancel culture, it’s also ratepayer funded libraries. Once again ‘health and safety’ has been used as an excuse.</p>
<p>“Health and safety should not be allowed to be used as an excuse to ‘deplatform’ speakers unless there are threats to physical safety.</p>
<p>“I hosted this group at Parliament after they were rejected from Massey University. I don’t agree with everything they say, but I believe they have the right to debate important issue.</p>
<p>&quot;The small vocal group of self-appointed opinionators who complained about this need to mind their own business and let adult citizens in a free society mind theirs.</p>
<p>“ACT will always fight for freedom of speech. We exist to have honest conversations about difficult issues and to unite New Zealanders behind good ideas.”</p>
