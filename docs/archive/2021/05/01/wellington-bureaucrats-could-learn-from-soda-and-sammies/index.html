<p>“Our Wellington bureaucrats could learn a thing or two from Amazon on how to avoid largess, especially when taxpayer money is at stake,” says ACT’s Deputy Leader Brooke van Velden.</p>
<p>“Bureaucrats from the Film Commission and Tourism New Zealand weren’t afraid to whip out the taxpayer funded credit card when it seems Amazon staff would have been happy with a sandwich.</p>
<p>“Information obtained by the ACT Party shows Government departments treated Amazon executives to fancy meals on Waiheke Island, at Amano, and Odettes, costing more than $5,000. In return Amazon supplied a simple meal of sandwiches and soda.</p>
<p>“Tourism and Economic Development Minister Stuart Nash needs to explain whether he’s comfortable with this spending.</p>
<p>“Every dollar spent on Amazon is money that that can&#39;t be spent where it’s needed such as mental health, medicines, or in the pockets of families who are hurting because of Covid-19.</p>
<p>“While the Government may take the attitude that a few thousand dollars here and there is fine, it all adds up and it shows a culture of spending.</p>
<p>“All this at a time when we are drowning in debt, we can’t afford for wasteful spending like this.”</p>
