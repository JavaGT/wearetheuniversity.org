<p><strong>Friday, 7 May 2021, 9:41 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University">Lincoln University</a></strong></p>
<p>The first Lincoln University Graduation at the Christchurch Town Hall since the Christchurch earthquakes also includes a celebration after last year’s COVID-19 cancellation.</p>
<p>Lincoln graduates and graduands (those yet to graduate) will be back in town on Thursday 13 and Friday 14 May, for the first time in 11 years.</p>
<p>The last time the University’s graduating students paraded through the city’s streets in their mortarboards and gowns was in 2010, and this year there will be three processions.</p>
<p>Last year’s ceremony could not go ahead because of the COVID-19 lockdown so a special celebration ceremony is being held to honour 2020 graduates on 13 May, with 275, plus guests, attending, while 601 graduands will attend Friday’s ceremonies.</p>
<p>Earthquake damage to the Town Hall in 2011 pushed Lincoln graduations to the Lincoln Event Centre for nearly a decade, with the procession starting from the University’s campus.</p>
<p>The move back to town was initiated in 2020. The key driver for this decision was the difficulty perceived with concentrating graduation activities on campus and the immediate area during the University’s ongoing major rebuild programme.</p>
<p>The refurbished Town Hall is a larger venue and will allow more family members to enjoy the occasion.</p>
<p>The procession will start at the Christchurch Art Gallery and make its way down Worcester Boulevard, down Oxford Terrace, and across Victoria Square to the Town Hall.</p>
<p>The celebration event will feature graduates in full regalia being called up on stage, and all of the ceremonies, as well as the processions, will be live-streamed.</p>
<p>Lincoln University Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor Bruce McKenzie, said Lincoln wanted an opportunity to publicly congratulate its 2020 graduates and their families, as well as the 2021 cohort.</p>
<p>He added it was wonderful to be back in the central city and marching through a rejuvenated Christchurch, and to return to the Town Hall.</p>
<p>“The Town Hall is a fantastic venue at which we hosted graduation ceremonies from 1994 until 2010, and it is great to be back, and to be able to showcase our graduates and graduands to the people of Christchurch through the procession.</p>
<p>“It will be a memorable return, especially with the celebration added.”</p>
