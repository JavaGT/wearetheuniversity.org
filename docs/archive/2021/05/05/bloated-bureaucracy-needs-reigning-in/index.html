<p>“The Government has let the public service get completely out of control before attempting to reign it in,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.</p>
<p>“Since Labour took office the public service has increased by 10,000 people. The average growth per year under Labour is six percent. It was one percent when ACT had a confidence and supply agreement with Government.</p>
<p>&quot;The number of bureaucrats earning more than $100,000 has grown by 43 percent, from 10,519 in 2018 to 15,055 now.</p>
<p>“And it’s not like we’re getting value for money. Delivery from Government has been so poor it’s had to start an “implementation unit” because it’s been failing to deliver.</p>
<p>“It’s all well and good to virtue signal now about pausing pay increases but ten thousand bureaucrats and one implementation unit later, the horse has already bolted.</p>
<p>“What we need now is an assurance from Labour that it won’t hire expensive consultants to avoid a head count of full time staff. It’s understood some recruiters in Wellington have said they have “more Government contracts than they know what to do with.”</p>
<p>“ACT believes that public policy matters. We have constructive and solutions-focused policy for all New Zealanders, particularly through reducing the role of government and increasing the role of free markets.&quot;</p>
