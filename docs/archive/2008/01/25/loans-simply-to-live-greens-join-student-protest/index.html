<p>Loans simply to live: Greens join student protest</p>
<p>Green Party Education Spokesperson Metiria Turei is to join tertiary<br>students at Parliament to protest student allowance polices which have<br>forced the average student debt up to nearly $30,000.</p>
<p>The Green Party&#39;s cooperation agreement with the Government requires<br>them to make budget allocations for raising parental income thresholds<br>which will increase the number of students eligible for student<br>allowances.</p>
<p>&quot;The Green Party wants to make sure the number of students getting<br>full allowances increases, as that is where the real need is,&quot; Mrs<br>Turei says.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Government simply raises the top threshold, so that more<br>students are entitled to $20 a week, it will be a failure to meet our<br>agreement and a gross insult to students.&quot;</p>
<p>New research released today shows that just to cover essential living<br>costs, students are required to take out bank loans and use overdrafts<br>and credit cards.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no justification for students being the only group in<br>society forced to borrow simply to live.</p>
<p>&quot;This inequity is directly reflected in a significant reduction of<br>enrolments from students from poorer backgrounds, down from 15 percent<br>in 2004 to 6 percent in 2007.</p>
<p>&quot;The new research shows that 88 percent of students believe that<br>loans, which are taken out just to survive, will have some impact on<br>their ability to buy a house.</p>
<p>&quot;Over a third say it will impact other important life decisions such<br>as when to have children and ability to save for the future.</p>

<p>&quot;These are significant decisions that no previous generation has had<br>to consider on the basis of a crippling loan often acquired while<br>still a teenager and in the early twenties.</p>
<p>&quot;Universal student allowances must be restored if we are to deal with<br>the ramifications of a generation growing up in debt such as the loss<br>of our graduates to overseas jobs, the inability to get into the<br>housing market, and the forced delay starting families,&quot; Mrs Turei<br>says.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is that Government policies are falling far short of a fair<br>deal for tertiary students who are being compelled out of the country,<br>either to earn enough to pay off their debt or to avoid it<br>altogether.&quot;</p>
