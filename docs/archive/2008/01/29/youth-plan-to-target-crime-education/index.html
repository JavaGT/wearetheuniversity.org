<p><strong>Tuesday, 29 January 2008, 12:03 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>John Key MP<br>National Party Leader</p>
<p>29 January 2008</p>
<p>Youth Plan to target crime, education</p>
<p>National Party Leader John Key today announced policies to fight a growing youth crime wave and ensure young people get into education or training.</p>
<p>In a speech in Auckland, he outlined National’s Youth Plan, which consists of a Youth Guarantee and tough new law &amp; order initiatives to combat youth crime.</p>
<p>“Last year, in my underclass speech I warned that New Zealand was seeing a dangerous drift toward social and economic separatism. Helen Clark denied the problem existed, yet nobody can deny its fruits, which are seen daily in the media.</p>
<p>“The truth is that after nine years, Labour’s economic underperformance hasn’t delivered the social dividend they promised.</p>
<p>“Far too many young people are not in education, training, or work – more than 25,000 in fact aged 15 to 19. Far too many kids leave school with no qualifications.</p>
<p>“Under the Youth Guarantee, National will provide a universal, no-cost education entitlement for all 16- and 17-year-olds so they can access school-level educational study at approved institutions. Most will remain at school, but some won’t.</p>
<p>“Those not in work and who fail to take up the entitlement will get no state income support, although special circumstances will be taken into account.</p>
<p>“I am extremely worried about the youth crime problem, with senseless violence and killings seemingly occurring on a daily basis. Good, law-abiding Kiwis end up paying the price.</p>

<p>“We must act now to defuse these unexploded human time-bombs, who are on the fast-track to Paremoremo.</p>
<p>“Just at the weekend, a 14-year-old was arrested after a fatal stabbing of a man in Tokoroa. Last Friday, a 16-year-old was arrested after the senseless slaying of a student working in his family’s Manurewa dairy.</p>
<p>“The violence perpetrated by young criminals is escalating, and we simply must act.</p>
<p>“National will introduce “Fresh Start Programmes” as a Youth Court sentence for those on the road to serious offending. These revolutionary, year-long intensive programmes aim to instil discipline and address underlying causes of offending, and will include up to three months training at, for example, an army facility.</p>
<p>“Fresh Start Programmes aren’t going to be some sort of short-term camp which attempts to scare kids straight. What I’m talking about is a much more modern approach that tackles the underlying causes of criminal offending.</p>
<p>“I want to take the effective elements of army-type training and combine them with the most advanced expertise in youth offending and rehabilitation that New Zealand has to offer,” Mr Key says.</p>
<p>“National will also double maximum residential Youth Justice facility sentences from three to six months, and electronically monitor youths by way of ankle bracelets if they breach court-ordered supervision contracts.</p>
<p>“In addition, the Youth Court will be given powers to issue a range of new compulsory orders like parenting orders, mentoring programmes, and drug and alcohol rehab. National will back up these orders with funding.</p>
<p>“And we will extend the Youth Court’s jurisdiction so it can deal with 12 and 13-year-olds accused of serious crimes.”</p>
<p>National estimates that the Youth Plan will cost about $100 million annually when fully implemented - $65 million for the Youth Guarantee and $35 million for the youth justice initiatives.</p>
<p>“Under Helen Clark and Labour, our country has become a story of lost opportunities,” says Mr Key.</p>
<p>“National knows New Zealand has a great future if we embrace good ideas and put them into action.</p>
<p>“My sense is that in 2008, New Zealand is ready for those ideas; ready for a fresh start. The Youth Plan is part of that fresh start.”</p>
