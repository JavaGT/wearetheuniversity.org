<p>$245,000 DOC loo typifies Labour culture of extravagance</p>
<p>Revelations that the Department of Conservation spent $245,000 on a new architecturally designed toilet in the Nelson Lakes National Park illustrates a culture of extravagance within the Government, says National’s Conservation spokesman and Nelson MP Nick Smith.</p>
<p>“This toilet is costing more to build than an average family spends to build an entire house. We have tax-paying families struggling to afford a roof over their heads while Labour wastes hundreds of thousands on a luxurious dunny.”</p>
<p>In answers to Ministerial questions, Conservation Minister Steve Chadwick has confirmed the new toilet block cost $245,000, of which $20,000 was for architectural fees. Dr Smith lodged these questions after being approached by residents who were angry at the extravagance and waste represented by the new toilet block.</p>
<p>“It shows how out of touch DOC has become from the taxpayers who fund them when they engage an architect to build a toilet.</p>
<p>“I am lodging a formal complaint with the Auditor-General. I am not alleging any dishonesty by the department, architect or builder, rather a gross over-specification that resulted in poor use of taxpayer money.”</p>
