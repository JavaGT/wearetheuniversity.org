<h3>Reading Recovery hours slashed</h3>
<p>The number of hours for remedial reading tuition through the Reading Recovery programme has dropped markedly since Labour came into Government, meaning hundreds of Kiwi 6-year-olds needing extra reading help have missed out, says National&#39;s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.</p>
<p>Answers to parliamentary questions show that there are 4,001 fewer hours of Reading Recovery staffing support hours available than there were in 1999.</p>
<p>There were 260,000 teaching hours available in 1999, but this has dropped to 255,999.</p>
<p>Reading Recovery provides daily one-to-one teaching with a specially trained teacher for children making the slowest progress in literacy learning after a year at school. It is supplementary to classroom instruction.</p>
<p>&quot;Though 4,001 hours might not seem significant to some, it&#39;s the equivalent of helping 114 children to learn to read.</p>
<p>&quot;Schools can choose a range of reading interventions to help struggling kids, but Reading Recovery remains on offer in 65% of schools.</p>
<p>&quot;Those additional hours from 1999 could have meant the success or failure for some students&#39; education.</p>
<p>&quot;While Labour Education Ministers have continually spoken in support of the scheme, there has been a slow decline in hours actually available to children struggling to learn to read&quot;.</p>
