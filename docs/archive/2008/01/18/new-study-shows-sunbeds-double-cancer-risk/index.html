<p>New study shows sunbeds double cancer risk</p>
<p>The Government must act to regulate the sunbed industry following a new report which found the cancer risks associated with sunbed use are much higher than previously thought, Green Party Health Spokesperson Sue Kedgley says.</p>
<p>In a report analysing 21 previous studies, the Queensland Institute of Medical Research found that people who first used a sunbed under the age of 35 raise the risk of forming the dangerous skin cancer melanoma by 98 per cent.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation has previously reported that there is up to a 75 percent increase in the chance of developing melanoma among those who had first used a sunbed in their teens or twenties.</p>
<p>The latest study also found an individual&#39;s chance of developing melanoma increased by 22 per cent if they had ever used a sunbed, compared to those who had never used a sunbed.</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley has been repeatedly calling for the regulation of the rapidly growing sunbed industry in New Zealand, and says this new study provides further compelling evidence for tighter controls.</p>
<p>&quot;The Health Minister must act quickly to regulate the industry. Voluntary standards which prohibit people under 18 and people with fair skin from using sunbeds must be legally enforced,&quot; Ms Kedgley says.</p>
<p>&quot;A Green Party survey showed that these voluntary standards are routinely ignored by many sunbed operators, and some have never even heard of them.</p>
<p>&quot;The sunbed industry is experiencing rapid growth in New Zealand. A significant proportion of users are adolescent and female, and are oblivious to the risks they are exposing themselves to.</p>
<p>&quot;Over a thousand New Zealanders are diagnosed with melanoma each year and hundreds die from it.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the findings of the Australian report, failure by the Health Minister would be utterly irresponsible,&quot; Ms Kedgley says.</p>
