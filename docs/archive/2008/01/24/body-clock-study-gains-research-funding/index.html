<p>Body clock study gains research funding</p>
<p>Sleep researcher Dr Sarah-Jane Paine has been awarded the Health Research Council Eru Pomare Research Fellowship in Māori Health, worth $463,000 over three years.</p>
<p>Dr Paine, from the Sleep/Wake Research Centre at Massey University in Wellington, will embark on an innovative programme of research that will advance the sleep health of all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>This includes continuing her research into the circadian body clock and how this clock regulates sleep timing.</p>
<p>She will also compare the prevalence of circadian rhythm sleep disorders in Māori and non-Māori, and examine relationships with age, sex, night work and socioeconomic deprivation.</p>
<p>Dr Paine also plans to develop best-practice guidelines to improve health service delivery for Māori, using sleep disorders as a case study.</p>
<p>The Eru Pomare Research Fellowship in Māori Health honours the legacy of Professor Pomare and his contributions to gastroenterology. It provides funding for an emerging leaders in Māori health research with a PhD or equivalent, for clinical or medical research.</p>
<p>Dr Paine says she is honoured to receive the Fellowship.</p>
<p>“This award is critical to furthering my training not only as a sleep scientist but as a Māori health researcher working in the empirical sciences.</p>
<p>“I look forward to continuing my research into the linkages between sleep, health and public health policy, and their role in meeting Professor Pomare’s goal of improving Māori health outcomes and eliminating disparities.”</p>
