<p>Do you have a great business idea? Find out whether it&#39;s really a million dollar baby or just hot air in a suit.</p>
<p>Bear Baiting is an event hosted by the University of Otago&#39;s Enterprise Office, in collaboration with the Upstart Business Incubator, KickStart and the University&#39;s Master of Entrepreneurship programme.</p>
<p>Entry into this fantastic event is absolutely free and open to anyone with an original idea - you don&#39;t have to be at the University of Otago. You could be a first year student, postgraduate, working in engineering or milking cows on the Taieri - it doesn&#39;t matter, we just want to hear from you.</p>
<p>Bear Baiting is a brilliant opportunity to put your entrepreneurial ideas to the test with the added bonus of a rare chance to have four caged experts provide a rigourous commercial evaluation in front of a live audience.</p>
<p>Simply register below to be in to win $5000 worth of free business advice from Dunedin&#39;s Upstart Business Incubator and other great prizes. Submit your details along with a brief outline of your concept or idea. Those in the running to pitch on the night will be contacted and groomed for readiness by the talented Enterprise Office staff.</p>
<p>All entrants will receive an invitation to the formal cocktail party after the event where you&#39;ll mingle and network with other entrants, venture capitalists, business experts and the Bears.</p>
<p>Register</p>
<p>You&#39;ll need to register your interest by 10 March 2008.</p>
