<p>MEDIA RELEASE 30 April 2008</p>
<p>Professor Belich kicks off ‘New Work, New Zealand’ series</p>
<p>Victoria University Professor of History, James Belich, will next week explain why English speaking societies grew much faster than others in the long 19 th century.</p>
<p>His talk, entitled ‘The Settler Revolution in the Long Nineteenth Century’, is the first in a series of seminars by Victoria’s Stout Research Centre for New Zealand Studies.</p>
<p>“This new seminar series is an exciting initiative. It’s about time we exported one or two ideas from New Zealand, and put New Zealand research into a global context. My seminar is going to be at Te Herenga Waka Marae, which will be a bit of a homecoming for me. I used to be an honorary lecturer in M a ori at Victoria University,” says Professor Belich.</p>
<p>The ‘New Work, New Zealand’ series, which aims to showcase new approaches to New Zealand studies, will be on Wednesdays during May and June 2008.</p>
<p>Professor Belich recently joined Victoria University’s Stout Research Centre, which is a leading centre for innovative New Zealand studies research. He is currently writing a book about transnational settler histories, due out in 2009. “While the book is anglo-focussed, it tries to understand historically the reasons for this growth rather than assuming it is intrinsic superiority of any kind,” says Professor Belich.</p>
<p>Professor Belich’s seminar will be at Te Herenga Waka Marae, 46 Kelburn Parade, Wellington, on 7 May 2008, 4.10-5.30pm. Tea and coffee will be served from 3.45pm.</p>
