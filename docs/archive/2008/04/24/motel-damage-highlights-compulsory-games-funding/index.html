<p>Motel damage highlights compulsory funding of University Games<br>Media release: Student Choice, 24 April 2008<br>Categories: education, tertiary education</p>
<p>Damage to a Rotorua motel during the recent University Games has highlighted<br>the fact that the games are largely funded through a compulsory levy imposed<br>on all university students, Student Choice said today.</p>
<p>The University Games are funded through a compulsory levy imposed on every<br>university student regardless of whether or not they play sport or attend<br>the games. The levy is collected as part of the compulsory student<br>association fees every university student must pay before they can enrol.</p>
<p>The games are organised by University Sport New Zealand (USNZ), an<br>organisation with fulltime staff and offices in Wellington. In 2007 USNZ<br>took over $223,000 from students in levies. The money students have to pay<br>USNZ is in addition to the fees they have to pay to fund the New Zealand<br>Union of Student Associations, another Wellington-based bureaucracy funded<br>through compulsory membership.</p>
<p>Student Choice spokesman Mike Heine said the cost of the games should be met<br>by the students who actually attend the games. &quot;It&#39;s not fair to load the<br>cost of sport onto students who don&#39;t play sport and can&#39;t afford to travel<br>around the country to attend games,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mike Heine said USNZ also organise the snow games to be held in Wanaka in<br>August this year. &quot;It&#39;s ridiculous that students who are struggling to pay<br>their rent should be forced to subsidise other students who want to go<br>skiing,&quot; Heine said.</p>
<p>In 2004 Massey Wellington Students Association withdrew from University<br>Sport New Zealand, saying it was unreasonable for the association to spend<br>seven percent of its income on an event attended by only one percent of<br>Massey Wellington students.</p>
<p>Heine said the unfairness of the forced subsidy was another problem caused<br>by compulsory membership of tertiary student associations. Students should<br>be free to study without being forced to join student associations and fund<br>student politics and sport, he said.</p>
<p>Student Choice promotes freedom of association through voluntary membership<br>of student associations.</p>
