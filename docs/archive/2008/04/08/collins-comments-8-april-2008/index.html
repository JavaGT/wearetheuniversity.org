<h3>Collins Comments - 8 April 2008</h3>
<p>In the last Collins Comments dated 3 April 2008 I told you the silent march to support longer opening hours for the Papakura police station would begin at 11am on Saturday 12 April. Those joining the march are asked to assemble by 10.30am at Ray Small Park (next to the RSA). It ends at Central Park, opposite the Papakura police station. Come along and let it be known that the residents of Papakura expect a greater level of service from the local police including, at least, a front desk open 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>I attended the Vintage Day at Karaka on March 30 and had a great time seeing all the interesting old machinery and cars. The event was well attended and had something for everyone. It was a great family day out. I congratulate the Karaka Historical Society along with Vintage Engine Restorers Auckland for their organisation of the event. This, I understand, was the fifth event and I look forward to seeing it continue for many more years allowing the practical side of New Zealand&#39;s heritage to be available for future generations.</p>
<p>The Children&#39;s Commissioner seems to think that the tagging law doesn&#39;t need to change. She says the tagging happens in public spaces from which children are alienated.</p>
<p>I suggest she comes to Papakura and has a look at the skating bowl which has been built solely for young people and children. Almost every weekend it is completely covered in tagging. So the very space that is not meant to alienate, but in fact is meant to include and be for young people, is taken over by other young people who do not wish to have that space free for others.</p>

<p>The Children&#39;s Commissioner also seems to think that graffiti and tagging are seen as legitimate art forms and there is a history and social commentary behind them.</p>
<p>I challenge the commissioner to buy some of this art and put it on a wall in her own home.</p>
<p>She could save some taxpayer money on her trips around the world - eight last year - and stay at home in New Zealand to understand what it is for the people who have their properties defaced and ruined by this sort of so-called social art and history. We have to live in the real world. Manukau City will spend about $1 million a year on this issue. Papakura spends hundreds of thousands on it. Enough of the Politically Correct nonsense!</p>
<p>I take this opportunity to praise the people of Papakura, Manukau, Manukau Beautification Trust, Manukau City Council, Papakura District Council and even Work and Income who help out. We do everything we can to improve the environment for our young people to grow up in, and for old people to grow old in only to have it ruined by the sort of drivel put out by the Children&#39;s Commissioner. She should get real and understand that we have to live with this.</p>
