<p>Simon Power MP<br>National Party Justice &amp; Corrections Spokesman</p>
<p>8 April 2008</p>
<p>Labour’s record: violent crime up in provinces and cities</p>
<p>Violent crime is not just a big-city problem, with latest figures showing that many provincial areas had increases in violence well above the nationwide increase, says National’s Justice &amp; Corrections spokesman, Simon Power.</p>
<p>“Last year, violent crime increased nationally by 12.3%, with grievous assaults up 17.4%, serious assaults 16.3%, intimidation and threats 11.2%, and group assemblies 26%.</p>
<p>“And since 1999, violent crime has risen by a massive 43.6%, to 56,983 offences, with grievous assaults up 93% to 4,831, robberies up 65%, and serious assaults up 53%.</p>
<p>“It’s clear we’re having trouble getting on top of violence, and it’s natural to assume most of the problem is in the big cities.</p>
<p>“But an analysis shows the relentless rise in violence is not just a big-city problem – it’s happening up and down the country, in police districts from Northland to Southland.</p>
<p>“For example, Bay of Plenty had the biggest increase in violent crime of any police district, up a huge 22% in just one year, and a whopping 63% since 1999.</p>
<p>“Other big increases were in Tasman, where violent offences increased by 20% last year and by 47% since 1999, in Southern by 15% and 50% since 1999, Eastern by 14% and 45%, Central by 12% and 21%, and Northland by 12% and 45%.</p>
<p>Increases in other districts were: Auckland 28% since 1999, Waitemata 12% last year and 56% since 1999, Counties-Manukau 19% and 63% since 1999, Waikato 16% and 42%, Wellington 11% and 50%, and Canterbury 16% since 1999.</p>

<p>“These numbers are of great concern. They mean that no one, no matter where they live, is immune.</p>
<p>“They also mean Labour’s policies have failed – that New Zealanders are now less safe than they were when Labour was first elected.</p>
<p>“Their record in tackling violent crime has been appalling.”</p>
