<p><strong>Monday, 7 April 2008, 8:13 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Key pays tribute to firefighters</p>
<p>National Party leader John Key says his thoughts are with the families and friends of Waikato firefighter Derek Lovell who lost his life in yesterday’s blaze in Tamehere, and the loved ones of those firefighters who remain in a critical condition.</p>
<p>“This will have a profound effect on the lives of many people. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who remain in hospital.</p>
<p>“Derek Lovell gave 25 years of his life to the Fire Service and was clearly a man who was held in very high regard in his community and among his colleagues.</p>
<p>“My thoughts are also with the families and friends of Mr Lovell’s colleagues who are fighting for their lives.</p>
<p>“They answered the call of duty to serve their community.</p>
<p>“I am touched by the community spirit being shown by those who are rallying around and offering their support in the aftermath of this tragedy.</p>
<p>“All New Zealanders should take this opportunity to give thanks to our firefighters, who regularly put themselves in danger to save lives and preserve the property of others.”</p>
