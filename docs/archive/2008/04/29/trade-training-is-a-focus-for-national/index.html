<p>Trade training is a focus for National</p>
<p>National Party Associate Education (Trade Training) spokesman Colin King says a National Government would be working with business and Industry Training Organisations to stop the appalling drop out and failure rate in modern apprenticeships.</p>
<p>“Thursday is Industry Training Day, and the Industry Training Act was a product of the National Government in 1992. This Act has gone along way to meeting today’s training needs with its wide and varied opportunities.</p>
<p>“But there is much more that needs to be done. Labour capped the funding to the Industry Training Organisations and has been responsible for spending $400 million on reform after reform. These are valuable dollars which would have far better returns focused on productivity training inside the work place.</p>
<p>“National recognises and thanks all those employers and employees who have embraced the workplace training model, and encourages them to continue to train for excellence so we can become a high-skill, high-wage economy.</p>
<p>“National will support the ITOs in the leadership role set for them within the Act – by supporting ITOs, formal education providers, and businesses to build more enduring relationships.</p>
<p>“National’s Trades In Schools policy will be a very visible feature of this. We’ll also relentlessly target literacy and numeracy to equip students with the basic skills they need to become the tradespeople of tomorrow.”</p>
