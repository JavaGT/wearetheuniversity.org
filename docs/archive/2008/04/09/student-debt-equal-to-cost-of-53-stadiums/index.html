<p>Official Media Release</p>
<p>9 April 2008.</p>
<p>Attention: Education Reporters, Political Reporters</p>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>Student Debt Equal to Cost of 53 Stadiums</p>
<p>This Thursday the 10th of April will see total student debt in New Zealand hit $10 Billion dollars.  </p>
<p>Student debt is now so large that it could be used to buy 53 new Stadiums for Dunedin.  </p>
<p>Much student debt is tied up in living allowances: students are the only sector in society forced to borrow in order to live.</p>
<p>Students at Otago University are marking the event with a protest on the Registry Lawn. The protest will run from 12pm – 2pm and will take the form of a massive birthday party for the Student Debt Monster. As well as a variety of party related activities - including free food and a horizontal bungy - students can register their protest by completing a birthday card with their name, year of study and student loan debt. These cards will be sent to the Parliamentary offices of Pete Hodgson, the Minister for Tertiary Education.</p>
<p>“We want to show the Minister that student debt isn’t just a number on a spreadsheet to us, debt is affecting the lives and futures of real people” said Otago University Students’ Association President (OUSA) Simon Wilson.</p>
<p>The average student in tertiary study in 2007 owed $28,838 to the government, banks and other loan providers.</p>
<p>Wilson describes this amount as “staggering, we are placing a very heavy burden on 19 and 20 year olds who are about to start their working lives.”</p>
<p>OUSA, with other student associations around the country, is calling for the introduction on a universal living allowance for all students.</p>
<p>Wilson argues that; “It’s time to abandon a system which is forcing our best and brightest to mortgage their futures just so they can pay their rent. The Government needs to stop making small ineffectual changes and introduce a living allowance for all students.”</p>
