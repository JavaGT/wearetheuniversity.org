<p><strong>Wednesday, 9 April 2008, 10:00 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Celebrate and Explore Antarctica with Victoria University</strong></p>
<p><strong>Antarctic Seminars Monday-Wednesday 14-16 April, evenings.</strong></p>
<p>Victoria University invites you to three free Antarctic discussions on the evenings of Monday to Wednesday 14-16 April. We will celebrate and explore the unique qualities of Antarctica and then move to discuss issues currently facing the continent and Southern Ocean and solutions. The discussions are part of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra’s <strong>Exploring Antarctica</strong> Festival in Wellington between 12 and 20 April 2008. There is a wide range of Antarctic events.</p>
<p><strong>Fantastic Antarctica:</strong> <strong>Ilott Theatre, ground floor of the Wellington Town Hall, Monday 14 April, 7.30-9.00pm</strong><br>What&#39;s so special about Antarctica? Chaired by Kim Hill, the seminar brings writer Bill Manhire, painter Dick Frizzell, science communicator Lloyd Davis and ecologist Vonda Cummings explore their experiences and perspectives on the world where longitude and latitude, night and day, heaven and hell, converge. Abode of miraculous extremophiles and extravagant landscapes in a thousand shades of white. Exquisitely sensitive barometer of climate change. Antarctica is more than sublime geographical oddity; we may need to preserve it to survive. Held in partnership with the Royal Society of New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>Protecting Antarctica:</strong> <strong>Paramount Theatre, Courtney Place, Tuesday 15 April, 5.30-7.30pm</strong><br>Antarctica’s environment is relatively pristine and isolated – but what threats does it face? Who and what protects it? You might be surprised by the fantastic and fragile nature of the Antarctic environment. Panelists will discuss efforts to ensure that the unique qualities of Antarctica are not undermined by human activities. Panelists include Joanna Mossop (Antarctic governance); Neil Gilbert (issues facing the Antarctic environment); Cath Wallace (the role of the public and NGOs in protecting Antarctica); Michael Donoghue on whales and the Southern Ocean, and Peter Cozens (security issues).</p>

<p><strong>Cool Antarctica</strong>: <strong>Paramount Theatre, Courtney Place, Wednesday 16 April, 5.30-7.30pm</strong><br>It’s not cool to heat Antarctica.

Panelists include Martin Manning (Climate Change-what is settled and what is uncertain-an international perspective); Nancy Bertler (climate change in Antarctica);Peter Barrett (Antarctic climate past and future); Jonathan Boston (international efforts to address climate change); Ralph Chapman (New Zealand action on climate change).</p>
<p>Other events in the Festival include a special concert by the NZSO, an Art After Dark event at Te Papa, an exhibition at The New Dowse, and a screening of Scott of the Antarctic. The full festival programme can be found at <a href="http://www.nzso.co.nz">www.nzso.co.nz</a>.</p>
