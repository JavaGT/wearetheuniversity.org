<p>Hands on education show</p>
<p>Massey University and UCOL have created a novel way to show secondary school students what study and career options are available to them in Palmerston North</p>
<p>They have joined forces to hold a Tertiary Discovery Day in the city, with interactive displays and activities that students can take part in. The organisers say it’s based on the principle that the best way to make a decision is to try out the options first hand.</p>
<p>As well as exploring the displays and trying out the equipment, visiting students will be able to talk to academic staff from the University and from UCOL.</p>
<p>Tertiary Discovery Day will be held on Tuesday 15 April at the Palmerston North Convention Centre. Massey Student Liaison Adviser Brent Costley and UCOL External Relations Team Leader Danette Whitehouse say the timing is important.</p>
<p>“It’s relatively early in the year which will allow senior students plenty of time to consider various tertiary study options for 2009 and to seek more information on their chosen subjects.”</p>
<p>“The event is also intended to encourage students to study in Palmerston North, by showcasing the variety of options available at UCOL and Massey University. It has the support of the Palmerston North City Council’s Student City initiative,” they say.</p>
<p>Tertiary Discovery Day will run from 11 am until 7 pm to allow students to attend with their school during the day and with their parents in the evening. Members of the public are also welcome. There is no entrance fee.</p>
