<p><strong>Annual Report highlights success of staff and students</strong></p>
<p>Victoria University of Wellington’s 2007 <em>Annual Report</em> highlights a year of achievements by students, staff and alumni.</p>
<p>ViceChancellor Professor Pat Walsh said the report, recently tabled in Parliament, outlined a range of the University’s successes from scholarships to awards for academic excellence.</p>
<p>“Last year Victoria University continued to be a leading contributor to climate change research in New Zealand. Of note was the appointment of climate scientist Martin Manning as Professor and Research Fellow in Climate Change.</p>
<p>“Staff achievements included three of last year’s prestigious James Cook Research Fellowships being awarded to Victoria University’s scientific researchers – Professors Paul Callaghan, Rod Downey and Ken McNatty.”</p>
<p>Victoria University’s students were awarded for their achievements with more than $1.5 million of the Government’s Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarships received by the University’s graduate or postgraduate students. Victoria University graduate Amanda Gilbertson was one of three New Zealand students selected for a Rhodes Scholarship and will study towards a DPhil in anthropology at Oxford University.</p>
<p>The report showed that, excluding the New Zealand School of Music, the University achieved growth in fulltime student numbers of 2.6 per cent to more than 17,000 students.</p>
<p>“I believe this growth reflects a winning combination – a quality university offering an outstanding student learning experience with a central location in New Zealand’s beautiful capital city.” The University’s <em>Annual Report</em> can be viewed online at <a href="http://www.vuw.ac.nz/annualreports">www.vuw.ac.nz/annualreports</a></p>
