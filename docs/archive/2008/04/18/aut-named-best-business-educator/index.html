<p>AUT named best business educator</p>
<p>AUT Business School has been named New Zealand&#39;s best business educator at the Vero Excellence in Business Support Awards 2008.</p>
<p>Around 96% of New Zealand businesses are small-to-medium sized and the awards recognise organisations and individuals that support them.</p>
<p>AUT&#39;s real-world approach to teaching its business degree students was key to its success in the awards. This includes strong links with industry leaders who also contribute to curriculum development, a unique student co-op internship programme and an emphasis on students creating real and successful businesses which have to post a profit.</p>
<p>Another factor was the Business School&#39;s building which was codesigned by Business Dean, Professor Des Graydon. Students sit around tables in small purpose-built classrooms which encourages discussion with teachers and each other.</p>
<p>BDO Spicers chairperson Judith Stanway says the awards celebrate the best in New Zealand business support.</p>
<p>&quot;BDO Spicers is continually impressed by AUT&#39;s ability to take the pick of international best practice models and implement them in the highly competitive New Zealand education market,&quot; she says. &quot;In particular the co-op placement programme is widely recognised as developing work-ready graduates with a real understanding of the business environment.&quot;</p>
<p>The awards were announced at a black tie gala dinner last night attended by Minister for Small Business the Honourable Clayton Cosgrove and New Zealand&#39;s leading SMEs.</p>

<p>The AUT Business School was one of 48 finalists in 11 award categories ranging from large businesses, public private sector partnerships and not-for-profit. Entrants in the education provider category included the University of Otago, Lincoln, Massey and Canterbury universities, The Knowledge Gym and The Results Group.</p>
<p>Vero Insurance chief executive Roger Bell says through their support, the award winners have given New Zealand companies a competitive and sustainable edge.</p>
<p>&quot;The AUT Business School joins the prestigious list of award-winners that demonstrate international levels of best practice in their businesses and have quality support as a key &#39;point of difference&#39;,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Finalists were chosen after a &quot;rigorous and objective evaluation&quot; by the New Zealand Business Excellence Foundation which manages the awards and the winners represent the top of the crop, he says.</p>
<p>AUT Tech Park (now AUT Innovation Park) was a finalist in the High Growth Sector.</p>
