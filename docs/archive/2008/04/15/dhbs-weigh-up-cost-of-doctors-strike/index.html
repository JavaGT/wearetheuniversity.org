<p><strong>Tuesday, 15 April 2008, 3:58 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Tony Ryall MP National Party Health Spokesman</p>
<p>15 April 2008</p>
<p>DHBs weigh up cost of doctors&#39; strike</p>
<p>National Party Health spokesman Tony Ryall says the looming junior doctors&#39; strike is expected to force the cancellation of hundreds of operations and thousands of specialist appointments at hospitals around the country.</p>
<p>&quot;District Health Boards have also now agreed to an emergency contingency plan to pay senior doctors up to $300 per hour during daylight and $500 per hour at night on top of the usual pay rate, to cover for their junior colleagues on strike.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ryall says Health Minister David Cunliffe has confirmed in Parliament today that 800 patients will have their elective surgery postponed and 5,500 specialist appointments will be postponed.</p>
<p>&quot;More patients will miss out on their operations and won&#39;t get to see a specialist. More people will be forced back on the waiting list, to await the Government&#39;s next waiting list cull.</p>
<p>&quot;These are the human casualties of Labour&#39;s health workforce crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;Meanwhile, DHBs are spending $100 million a year on locums just to fill the gaps, people can&#39;t get on a GP&#39;s books, and Kiwi women are struggling to find midwives given the shortages throughout the country.</p>
<p>&quot;The workforce crisis is not new. Labour has produced 43 reports on the workforce crisis since it came to office, but still there are critical shortages.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is spending $6 billion extra a year on health and it has built up an army of bureaucrats. Yet the public still can&#39;t get an operation when they need it - and if they&#39;re lucky enough to be scheduled for one - they get it cancelled because the workforce crisis hasn&#39;t been fixed.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders are sick of the reports, strategies and action plans. After nine years they want more action, not more plans for action.&quot;</p>
