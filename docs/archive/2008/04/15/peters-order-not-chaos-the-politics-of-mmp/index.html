<p>“Order Not Chaos – The Politics of MMP”</p>
<p>Embargoed against delivery</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you tonight.</p>
<p>Your invitation said tonight’s topic could be anything – a dangerous proposition for a politician – so let us a take a safe path and talk politics.</p>
<p>What we really need to address is MMP politics.</p>
<p>You see all of the hyperbole which surrounded the events of the past two week were based on one thing – the fact that some so called experts have not come to grips with MMP.</p>
<p>It’s not the politicians who don’t understand. Bar a few obvious exceptions, most politicians now actually get MMP and understand its potential.</p>
<p>That is why in the same week you can have both Helen Clark and John Key support me as Foreign Minister, despite having differing views.</p>
<p>They understand, like we do in New Zealand First, that MMP means you won’t agree on everything, but that is not the end of the political world.</p>
<p>Indeed the days of the dull homogenised party hack MP, who only came in two styles and who didn’t think for himself or herself are over.</p>
<p>Democracy has manifested itself in several forms of governance with differing dimensions. But the one dimension which is universal to all effective democracies, is different points of view and a real contest of ideas in the public and political arena.</p>
<p>But the critical point is that these differences do not prevent us from working constructively together on issues on which we agree.</p>

<p>You all know the background to the changes in our voting system.</p>
<p>Since the 1950s voters were increasingly disillusioned with the old two-party system.</p>
<p>Criticism of the voting system intensified after the 1978 and 1981 elections when Labour won more votes than National but National won more seats.</p>
<p>More voters began to look to alternative parties.</p>
<p>Social Credit, the leading &#39;third&#39; party since 1954, won 16 per cent of the overall vote in 1978 but only one seat out of the 92 in Parliament.</p>
<p>Three years later, in 1981, nearly 21 percent of electors voted for Social Credit, but the party gained just two seats.</p>
<p>In the 1984 election the New Zealand Party won 12 percent of the vote but no seats.</p>
<p>Following Labour&#39;s victory in the 1984 election, a Royal Commission on the Electoral System was set up and the following year recommended New Zealand adopt the German-style MMP system.</p>
<p>Under this each elector would get two votes, one for an electorate MP and one for a party. The size of Parliament would increase to 120 MPs.</p>
<p>In 1993 we voted for MMP and in 1996 New Zealand elected its first MMP government.</p>
<p>The date of 1984 is doubly important though.</p>
<p>As well as the year of an election for New Zealand it was also the title of a book – written by George Orwell.</p>
<p>The book 1984 was about life in a dictatorship as lived by a character called Winston Smith.</p>
<p>He was a worker at the Ministry of Truth and his downfall came about when he ran foul of the Government.</p>
<p>In that book Orwell created the phrase “Big brother is watching you” and other catchy quotes like:</p>
<p>“War is peace”,</p>
<p>“Freedom is slavery”,</p>
<p>and “Ignorance is Strength.”</p>
<p>You might well ask what these slogans have in common with New Zealand in 1984.</p>
<p>Well, we believe that 1984 was the date New Zealand started an economic and social revolution – and equally meaningless and contradictory slogans were created.</p>
<p>Remember them?</p>
<p>“No gain without pain”</p>
<p>“Work Smarter Not Harder”</p>
<p>“We’re reducing staff to increase service”</p>
<p>And “Agriculture is a sunset industry”</p>
<p>Thousands of people were made redundant as these slogans were chanted by spin doctors and the mindless media.</p>
<p>We sure suffered the pain – but where was the gain?</p>
<p>Hundreds of industries were closed down as our trade doors were thrown open and we got virtually nothing in return.</p>
<p>We led the world in opening up the economy and appointed a Reserve Bank governor who choked the life out of the economy with crippling interest rates and an overpriced currency.</p>
<p>Sadly we haven’t learnt the lessons from the past on that front.</p>
<p>Those of us who questioned the wisdom of this were accused of being Luddites and glibly informed that this was going to make things better for all of us.</p>
<p>But between 1984 and 1996 New Zealanders were hammered with slogans as taxpayer owned assets were flogged off at bargain basement prices.</p>
<p>Many of these assets ended up in foreign hands, leaving us all the poorer.</p>
<p>These policies were pursued by both Labour and National.</p>
<p>The two old political parties had one thing in common.</p>
<p>They had election manifestos for the voters and hidden agendas for their mates.</p>
<p>Remember, in 1990 a certain political leader pledged to New Zealanders that the superannuation surtax would be scrapped, “no ifs no buts no maybes”.</p>
<p>The promise was abandoned after the election.</p>
<p>But even worse the surtax was increased, at its meanest impost 92%.</p>
<p>It was against that background that New Zealanders voted for MMP.</p>
<p>The voters had reached the end of their tether with politicians cynically breaking promises.</p>
<p>At about that same time a certain protesting MP, also called Winston, was kicked out of the National Party, but was returned to Parliament as an independent and set up his own political party.</p>
<p>It was called New Zealand First and we were in the first MMP government of 1996.</p>
<p>We have to say that we achieved some things – like getting the super surtax removed, free healthcare for children and other benefits now entrenched.</p>
<p>But National MPs, at the time led by a certain Mrs Shipley, found it hard to swallow the thought of sharing government – so the coalition folded.</p>
<p>They simply didn’t grasp that the winner takes all mentality of First Past the Post was over and that they must now share the table with those with different views.</p>
<p>In many ways MMP meant that the silent majority which had sat muted by the old system now had a voice – and a strong one at that.</p>
<p>Nine years later New Zealand First was in a similar position due to the numbers in Parliament.</p>
<p>It was a case of once bitten twice shy.</p>
<p>We did not want to go into government, but we wanted a stable political system and some gains for sector groups we felt were being disadvantaged.</p>
<p>Our agreement of confidence and supply with Labour gives us room to disagree.</p>
<p>There is no threat of political instability.</p>
<p>And we still say good morning to all the other MPs in Parliament.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of MMP is that it means all issues are now thoroughly debated and all legislation has to be examined closely.</p>
<p>Differing and opposing views have to be taken into account.</p>
<p>And there is another important difference now – it is called transparency.</p>
<p>In the old days of First Past the Post voters were kept in the dark and governments did as they liked via secret Cabinet decisions.</p>
<p>Evil deeds were always done behind closed doors.</p>
<p>All that has changed.</p>
<p>You see every single policy achievement New Zealand First has made under its supply and confidence agreement is consistent with the policies we campaigned on in 2005.</p>
<p>No surprises – no hidden agendas, just keeping our word using the influence we were dealt on election day.</p>
<p>Some may say we haven’t delivered on all the promises in our manifesto – but you can’t expect to win a Formula One race with a standard sedan.</p>
<p>In short you can only do what your number of party votes enables you to do.</p>
<p>The only trouble is that we have the “first past the post media” trying to explain MMP politics.</p>
<p>They just don’t get it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately they still see the world through FPP glasses and cannot see how people with differing views can work together for the good of the country.</p>
<p>Apparently there was a constitutional crisis in New Zealand last week but fortunately it was confined to a word processor in the Parliamentary press gallery.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that under MMP the House of Representatives is far more representative than it has ever been.</p>
<p>And under our confidence and supply agreement, we are bound to say that we do not always agree with the government.</p>
<p>But the government stands firm.</p>
<p>You might liken it to a rugby team in a tight spot.</p>
<p>The fullback yells “kick it” but the halfback passes it.</p>
<p>Nobody spits their mouth guard and goes to play for the opposing team!</p>
<p>Nobody gets a yellow card – or a red card for that matter because you are not engaged in foul or illegal play.</p>
<p>We have made it plain that after the 2008 election we will speak first to the party that gains the most votes.</p>
<p>We will do what the voters tell us.</p>
<p>We could work with either Helen Clark or John Key.</p>
<p>But, we do have a proviso about National because of our past experience.</p>
<p>Like all New Zealanders we want to know exactly where National stands on all the main issues, long before the election campaign.</p>
<p>We don’t go along with um argh, we’ll think about it and we will tell you later.</p>
<p>To be fair, this might not be John Key’s doing.</p>
<p>As an inexperienced leader he is probably relying heavily on his team of minders and advisors.</p>
<p>And before we could go with National, we would make every single MP in the National caucus sign up to whatever agreement was reached.</p>
<p>That includes all the right wingers and Act look-alikes that lurk in the shadows.</p>
<p>We know that there have been some in Labour who were hesitant at first about working with us – but who have now come to see the value of an alternative viewpoint.</p>
<p>Some probably still harbour reservations.</p>
<p>But they have learnt how MMP works and the real question which remains is – has National?</p>
<p>New Zealand First was formed because on some important issues the two old parties had stopped listening to ordinary New Zealanders.</p>
<p>MMP became our electoral system for the very same reason.</p>
<p>The irony is that many of the same issues which drove the formation of New Zealand First are as important today as they were 15 years ago.</p>
<p>And again it seems that many voters will look to the party of MMP – New Zealand First – for their solutions.</p>
<p>So as long as there are New Zealanders needing a strong voice and as long as the system allows us to, New Zealand First is up to the task of representing them.</p>
<p>That after all is what MMP is all about.</p>
<p>So when it comes to getting your knowledge of MMP and how its works – take it from those of us who are actually on the ground that it can and does work.</p>
<p>Don’t be seduced by the media’s lack of perspective – or their bias and prejudice against alternative ideas.</p>
<p>As the bard was wont to say – “The empty vessel makes the greatest sound”.</p>
<p>The key for us is to resolve not to let them drown out the real voice of the people, and to make sure they never do.</p>
