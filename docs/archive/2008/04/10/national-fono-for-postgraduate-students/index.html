<p>National Fono for Postgraduate students, Pacific Researchers and Scholars</p>
<p>Postgraduate students, researchers and scholars from New Zealand and the Pacific will attend the Building Pacific Research Capacity and Scholarship in New Zealand/Aotearoa Fono being held at the Fale Pasifika on 16-18 April and hosted by the Centre for Pacific Studies, University of Auckland.</p>
<p>This fono has been organised by Pacific scholars&#39; throughout the New Zealand universities, including AUT University, and funded as a result of an initiative by the Building Research Capability in the Social Sciences network (BRCSS), Hui Rangahau Tahi, which operates as a virtual community through a series of networks, one of which is the Pacific Talanoa Research series.</p>
<p>The increase in Pacific researchers and scholars; the national demand for evidence based and culturally appropriate research; and the growing body of knowledge and debate about what is Pacific research and how this should be carried out; set the background for this national fono.</p>
<p>While the fono primarily targets postgraduate students, early career researchers and established researchers are also invited to join. This will be a chance to debate and clarify understandings about the appropriateness of the dominant research methodologies and methods to Pacific contexts and learn about emerging Pacific paradigms, epistemologies, pedagogies and curriculum issues.</p>
<p>The fono will provide a forum for discussions aimed at building Pacific research capacity, rigour and leadership through:<br>Documenting what research is being carried out and how this is being done<br>Critiquing Pacific research epistemologies methodologies and key social research methods commonly used across sectors and/or research disciplines<br>Networking with other Pacific researchers and establish possibilities for research partnerships<br>Strengthening a national network of Pacific postgraduate students.</p>
<p>The four proposed fono streams are: research design (epistemologies and methodologies); methods (quantitative and qualitative); professional development (research and policy links pathways to professional development); and post graduate presentations of their research and research questions.</p>
