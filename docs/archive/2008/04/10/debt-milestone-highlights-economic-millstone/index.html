<p>Student debt milestone highlights economic millstone</p>
<p>Student debt levels are predicted to reach $10 billion tomorrow, creating unacceptable barriers to tertiary education, says Green Party Education Spokesperson Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>&quot;Our long term economic future is being threatened by this dire situation. The mushrooming student debt milestone represents an economic millstone for New Zealand,&quot; Mrs Turei says.</p>
<p>&quot;This $10 billion of debt is outrageous. The student debt crisis poses a long-term financial threat, while keeping a generation of Kiwis out of the housing market.&quot;</p>
<p>Growing indebtedness affects all students, but particularly those from lower socio economic groups, who are discouraged from taking out loans to study.</p>
<p>A recent New Zealand University Student Association (NZUSA) survey shows that students whose parents and guardians had no secondary school education were significantly more likely to be from a low socio-economic group, with parental income under $20,000, Maori, aged 26 years or more, and from Manukau Institute of Technology, Waiariki Polytechnic or Whitireia Polytechnic.</p>
<p>There is a significant reduction of university enrolments from students from poorer backgrounds, down from 15 percent in 2004 to 6 percent in 2007.</p>
<p>&quot;Debt concerns are restricting access to higher education, as many students opt for vocationally-orientated courses at certificate or diploma level, rather than academic degrees,&quot; Mrs Turei says.</p>
<p>And although the student population is increasing, fewer are getting a full allowance due to strict means testing.</p>
<p>Students are borrowing money - taking out bank loans and using overdrafts and credit cards - just to survive. And many debt-laden graduates choose to chase lucrative overseas job offers, rather than staying to contribute to the local economy.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s a ghettoisation of Maori, women and lower socio-economic groups into the cheaper, lower level courses and another form of negative social engineering. New Zealand&#39;s long term economic stability is being threatened by this debt crisis and the only solution to ensure access to education is a universal student allowance.&quot;</p>
