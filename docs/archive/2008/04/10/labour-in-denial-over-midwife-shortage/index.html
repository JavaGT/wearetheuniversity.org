<p>Katrina Shanks National Party MP</p>
<p>10 April 2008</p>
<p>Labour in denial over midwife shortage</p>
<p>&quot;Mums-to-be can have little faith that Labour will do anything about the health workforce crisis when it is in blatant denial over the national shortage of midwives,&quot; says Wellington-based National MP Katrina Shanks.</p>
<p>&quot;The Minister is absolutely wrong when she says that &#39;no DHBs have reported being unable to meet demand&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>Katrina Shanks is releasing papers from two of the 15 DHBs which are reporting a shortage of midwives.</p>
<p>&quot;The Associate Minister should correct her public response. Just because it&#39;s election year she should not be attempting to mislead New Zealanders about the looming crisis in this important part of the health workforce.&quot;</p>
<p>Official Information Act papers from Capital and Coast DHB reveal they are short of 10 Lead Maternity Carers (LMCs) and expect a long-term shortage of at least nine midwives.</p>
<p>A letter from Whanganui District Health Board says &#39;a looming shortage&#39; of midwives and obstetric and gynaecology specialists &#39;may have an impact on the provision of a safe maternity service&#39;.</p>
<p>Whanganui says &#39;currently there are approximately 50 women who do not have a Lead Maternity Carer&#39;, and that &#39;the shortage of midwives appears to be at a regional and national level. Other district health boards in the central region are experiencing and reporting similar shortages&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday, I released figures which show that thousands of women will struggle to get a midwife because of a national shortage. Steve Chadwick should not so casually dismiss these concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has ordered 43 reports into the health workforce crisis since it came to office. That is cold comfort for the thousands of Kiwi mums-to-be who are facing pregnancy, birth, and ante-natal care, uncertain about whether they can secure the wrap-around support a midwife can offer.&quot;</p>
