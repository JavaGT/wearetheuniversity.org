<p>Mums-to-be caught by health workforce crisis</p>
<p>&quot;More than 4,250 mums-to-be are in limbo as a desperate shortage of midwives leaves them scrambling to find a Lead Maternity Carer (LMC),&quot; says Wellington-based National MP Katrina Shanks.</p>
<p>&quot;Official Information Act answers reveal that District Health Boards say their communities are at least 85 midwives (LMCs) short. The College of Midwives conservatively estimates that each midwife should carry a caseload of between 40 and 50 women.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has known about the shortage in midwives for years. It has made excuses and called for more reports but still refuses to show leadership in addressing this issue.&quot;</p>
<p>The workforce crisis has been the subject of 43 reports since Labour came to office.</p>
<p>&quot;Mothers and babies have got good reason to be concerned when it comes to receiving maternity care. Things are likely to get a lot worse for expectant mums as Lead Maternity Carers become more and more scarce.&quot;</p>
<p>Katrina Shanks says there are insufficient New Zealand-trained students to replace midwives who are leaving the profession and New Zealand is becoming dependent upon overseas trained midwives.</p>
<p>And the situation as laid out in the papers may be far worse. A DHBNZ survey in the middle of last year pointed to a midwife shortage of around 200 across both hospitals and the community.</p>
<p>&quot;That supply of midwives from overseas cannot be sustained.&quot;</p>
<p>Late last week the Whanganui DHB called a special meeting to discuss the serious midwife workforce shortage in their region.</p>
<p>&quot;Fifteen out of the twenty one DHBs have stated that they have a shortage of midwives. They include the Bay of Plenty, Canterbury, Hutt Valley, Hawke&#39;s Bay, Lakes, MidCentral, Capital &amp; Coast, and Auckland, Waitemata (West), MidCentral (Tararua), Whanganui, Taranaki, Northland, Counties-Manukau and Southland.</p>
<p>&quot;Kiwi mums-to-be deserve better.&quot;</p>
