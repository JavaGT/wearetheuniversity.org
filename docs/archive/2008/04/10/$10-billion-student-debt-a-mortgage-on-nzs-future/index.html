<p>‘$10 billion student debt a mortgage on NZ’s future’ - Sharples</p>
<p>“&#39;User pays&#39; education has mortgaged our future as a nation,” says Dr Pita Sharples, Maori Party spokesperson on tertiary education.</p>
<p>“In every society, education is the critical pathway for personal and group development,” he says “- but a user-pays approach increases inequalities.”</p>
<p>“The grand total of $10 billion conceals especially severe impacts on some groups, including Maori.</p>
<p>“Maori have proven their passion for tertiary education - rates of participation are among the highest in the country, and rates of increase have been phenomenal.</p>
<p>“But no matter how bright, passionate or determined they are, those who start out with less money cannot afford to reach the top - in education, and therefore jobs or income,” says Dr Sharples.</p>
<p>“Debt owed by Maori students is around $1.5 billion – even though Maori participation is concentrated in lower levels of tertiary education, partly out of fear of how debt will be repaid.</p>
<p>“Graduates who have paid their own way, owe no debt to society - they are free to take their expertise overseas to work for the highest bidder,” he said.</p>
<p>“We should be investing in our young people and students, not demanding down payment on their future contribution to society.”</p>
