<p>23 April 2008</p>
<p>Maori education under Labour - is that it?</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s just released Maori Education Strategy Ka Hikitia is just another example of the empty rhetoric that has littered their nine year record in this area says National&#39;s Maori Affairs spokesman (Education and TPK), Tau Henare.</p>
<p>&quot;This document is a joke.</p>
<p>&quot;With 46% of Maori boys and 42% of Maori girls leaving school without even the most basic qualification, the Ministry of Education produces a document that says, &#39;The Ministry is strengthening its approach to using evidence to make decisions&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;The evidence has been staring Labour in the face for nine years. Its plans, reports, proposals, and strategies have only contributed to the growing bureaucracy at the Ministry - but done nothing for the kids who need help.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s policy is crystal clear. Literacy and numeracy will be a priority for every child, and students who decide they do not want to go on to university will be offered hands-on trade training while they are at school.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has a record of dismal failure in Maori education. They have conducted talkfest after talkfest while 30,000 kids wag school every week.</p>
<p>&quot;National is ambitious for Maori youth. We do not find it acceptable that only two out of three Maori kids take part in any pre-school education and almost half leave school without the skills to succeed.</p>
<p>&quot;Young Maori don&#39;t need more reports, they need action.&quot;</p>
