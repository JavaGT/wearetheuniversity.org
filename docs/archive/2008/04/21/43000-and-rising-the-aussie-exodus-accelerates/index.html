<p>Hon Dr Lockwood Smith MP<br>National Party Immigration Spokesman</p>
<p>21 April 2008</p>
<p>43,000 and rising - the Aussie exodus accelerates</p>
<p>The number of Kiwis voting with their feet by heading permanently to Australia is a damning indictment on Labour policies that are making it increasingly difficult for people to make ends meet, says National&#39;s Immigration spokesman, Lockwood Smith.</p>
<p>The latest immigration statistics, released today, show the number of people leaving for Australia rose 19% to 43,419 in the year to March 2008.</p>
<p>&quot;In March alone 4,152 New Zealanders packed up and pulled out.</p>
<p>&quot;Even when you balance the figures with those who arrived in New Zealand, the figures are staggering. The net loss is up 28% to 29,892.</p>
<p>&quot;And these are just the Australian figures. The exodus from New Zealand to all parts of the world is now 78,841, up 12% on 2007.</p>
<p>&quot;These are people fed up with a Labour Government that has mismanaged the economy, over-taxed people while gloating about its surplus, and delivered the highest interest rates in the developed world.</p>
<p>&quot;These are our tradesman and our university graduates - the future of this country is fleeing in droves.</p>
<p>&quot;Michael Cullen claims that &#39;we&#39;re better off without them&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;That may well be the refrain he is hearing on election night.&quot;</p>
