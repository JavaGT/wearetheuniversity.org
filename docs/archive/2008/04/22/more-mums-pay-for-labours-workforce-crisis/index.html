<p>Katrina Shanks<br>National Party MP</p>
<p>22 April 2008</p>
<p>More mums pay for Labour’s workforce crisis</p>
<p>“Mums-to-be are paying an increasingly high price for the workforce crisis in maternity services,” says National Party MP Katrina Shanks.</p>
<p>“It has got so bad that women on the West Coast are being forced to travel to Christchurch to get care during their high-risk pregnancies. The West Coast District Health Board can no longer guarantee their safety.”</p>
<p>Katrina Shanks says the board has closed Westport&#39;s Kawatiri birthing unit for deliveries on clinical safety grounds, and announced on Friday it had no obstetric and gynaecology available on most days until May 2.</p>
<p>“This comes just a few days after a woman at Wellington Hospital was forced to care for her newborn on a bench in a waiting room next to a public toilet.</p>
<p>“It also follows revelations that more than 4,500 Kiwi mums-to-be will struggle to find a midwife because of nation-wide shortages.</p>
<p>“After ordering 43 reports on the workforce crisis since it came to office, Labour has no solutions to the maternity service shambles.</p>
<p>“Labour has been warned repeatedly that the safety of women and their babies could be put at risk because of the crisis.”</p>
<p>National&#39;s health discussion paper Better, Sooner, More Convenient proposes a number of measures to start tackling the health workforce crisis.</p>
<p>They include, moving to medical training self-sufficiency, investigating bonding and student-loan write-offs for health professionals working in hard-to-staff areas, and re-engaging doctors and nurses in the running of the health system.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has managed to recruit an army of more than 10,000 bureaucrats, but has utterly failed to plan properly for the changing population.&quot;</p>
