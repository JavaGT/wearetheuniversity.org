<p>Export education contribution detailed</p>
<p>The contribution of export education to New Zealand&#39;s economic prosperity has been detailed by Infometrics economist Adolf Stroombergen writing in The Dominion Post and The Press. The provision of education to foreign fee-paying students had experienced impressive growth, rising from just over $500 million in 1999 to $2.2 billion in 2004. While the number of foreign fee-paying students had fallen since 2003, the export education industry still managed to generate about $2.3 billion of foreign exchange in 2007-08. Of that, an estimated $70 million came from overseas provision which included delivery of teaching at foreign locations, distance delivery through electronic means, sales of curriculum and learning materials and educational consulting and advisory work.</p>
<p>The export education industry&#39;s contribution to New Zealand&#39;s GDP was estimated at about $2.1 billion, supporting more than 32,000 fulltime equivalent jobs. On average</p>

<p>foreign fee-paying students spent $6500 on tuition fees and $17,600 on living costs such as accommodation, food and travel. In terms of fulltime equivalent students, universities constituted the industry&#39;s largest sector. University students were also the biggest source of foreign exchange earnings, contributing around a third of the total. China remained the most significant source of foreign fee-paying students, accounting for 24,800 out of a total of 91,300. South Korea was next with 17,900.</p>
<p>Though the immediate prospects for global growth were pessimistic, the fundamental driver of demand for export education was the desire for English language education and for degrees from English-based universities, coupled with the increase in size of the economic middle class in countries such as China and Brazil.</p>
<p>&quot;In the medium to long term, the growth in demand for export education will be strong. New Zealand needs to secure its share through the delivery of a high quality product in terms of the total education experience - formal qualifications, student living conditions, cultural activities and personal safety. The export education industry deserves our support,&quot; Mr Stroombergen wrote.</p>
