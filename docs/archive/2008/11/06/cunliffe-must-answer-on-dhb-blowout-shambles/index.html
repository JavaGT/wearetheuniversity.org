<p>Tony Ryall MP<br>National Party Health Spokesman</p>
<p>6 November 2008</p>
<p><strong>Cunliffe must answer on DHB blowout shambles</strong></p>
<p>National Party Health spokesman Tony Ryall says Labour must explain why it has let the deficit situation at Capital &amp; Coast District Health Board get so bad that there are now threats staff won’t be paid.</p>
<p>“This is a shambles and the Minister is letting it happen. No doubt he was hoping no one would find out about this before Saturday.”</p>
<p>Mr Ryall is commenting after reports today that the CCDHB is facing a $70 million budget blow-out and is now facing a stand-off with the Health Ministry over extra funding to get it through.</p>
<p>“This didn’t happen overnight, yet the Minister has let this descend to a point where the board’s now saying it might not be able to pay staff. This is unacceptable. What other problems are lurking in DHB annual plans? ”</p>
<p>Mr Ryall says the deficit also represents another broken health promise.</p>
<p>“Helen Clark promised to stop deficit funding and that Labour would ‘fund a balanced budget for our public health services’. More empty promises.</p>
<p>“After nine long years, billions of extra dollars, and thousands of extra bureaucrats the public should have noticed a vast improvement in health services.</p>
<p>“And the problems are not isolated to Wellington.</p>
<p>“Just this week a leaked report showed district health boards in the country’s north are under real pressure, particularly in terms of the workforce crisis – a crisis that Labour refused to accept as a reality.</p>
<p>“New Zealand needs a Government that will tackle the challenges facing the health system. National has a comprehensive plan to deliver better, sooner, more convenient health services.”</p>
