<p><strong>Thursday, 20 November 2008, 12:23 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Future architects and designers display work</p>
<p>The work of New Zealand&#39;s future architects and designers will be exhibited at Victoria University&#39;s Te Aro campus until 5 December 2008.</p>
<p>Highlights include award-winning interior architecture student Nazia Kachwalla&#39;s final year project and four projects selected to compete in the New Zealand Institute of Architects 2008 Graphisoft Student Design Awards.</p>
<p>The end-of-year exhibition at the University&#39;s School of Architecture features projects by final year students from architecture, building science, interior architecture and landscape architecture programmes.</p>
<p>Professor Gordon Holden, Dean of the Faculty of Architecture and Design, says final year portfolios mark a milestone for students. &quot;They represent five years of excellence in learning and research, building technical skills and exploring their creativity. I am confident these graduates will go on to achieve successes in their respective fields and be valued in the architecture and design industries.&quot;</p>
<p>Nazia recently won gold in the spatial design student category of the 2008 BeST Design Awards, the top award for student interior architects described by the industry as the Oscars of New Zealand design. Her final year project &#39;The Museum of Ephemera&#39; (pictured in the PDF) considered a redesign for the Museum of Wellington City and Sea.</p>
<p>Final year projects by New Zealand Institute Architects Graphisoft Student Design Award finalists Andrew Banks, Andrew Just, Ari Stevens and Ruwan Fernando are on display, as well as work by winners of the School of Architecture&#39;s excellence awards: Kevin Ma, James Mitchell, Raymond Atkins, Lisa Cumming, William Hoogeveen and Rong Zhang.</p>
<p>Members of the public are invited to visit the exhibition at Victoria University&#39;s Faculty of Architecture and Design, 139 Vivian Street, Wellington. The exhibition is open Monday to Friday from 9:00am-5:00pm until 5 December. Entry is free.</p>
