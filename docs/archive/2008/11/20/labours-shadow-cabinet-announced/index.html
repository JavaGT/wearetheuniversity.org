<p><strong>Thursday, 20 November 2008, 11:56 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>Labour&#39;s shadow Cabinet announced</p>
<p>Labour Party Leader Phil Goff today announced Labour&#39;s shadow Cabinet and spokesperson allocation.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s line up has a strong mix of experienced MPs including many who have a track record and proven competency as Ministers, together with fresh, talented newcomers.</p>
<p>&quot;With a caucus of 43, we have a strong talent pool to draw from. Our 13 new MPs represent diverse backgrounds, and are the best qualified and strongest intake into the Labour caucus since 1984.<br>They are an able and competent group who will grow with experience and will be ready to make a big contribution to an incoming sixth Labour Government in 2011.</p>
<p>&quot;As I announced last week, David Cunliffe is finance spokesperson and Darren Hughes and Steve Chadwick are the Senior and Junior Opposition Whips respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;Deputy leader Annette King will also be Labour&#39;s social development spokesperson. Parekura Horomia is Maori affairs spokesperson, and Chris Carter education.</p>
<p>&quot;The front bench has five newcomers in Ruth Dyson (health), Clayton Cosgrove (law and order, SoEs), Nanaia Mahuta (environment and tourism), Maryan Street (trade and tertiary education), and Darren Hughes (transport).</p>
<p>&quot;Newer and younger members of Caucus such as Darren Hughes, Charles Chauvel and Moana Mackey have been promoted into the shadow cabinet, together with Winnie Laban and Sue Moroney.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark (foreign affairs and arts, culture and heritage) and Michael Cullen (Shadow Leader of the House and Treaty of Waitangi negotiations) will provide guidance and expertise to our Caucus. I am delighted that they and other former senior ministers will be available to help newer MPs develop the skills they need to be an effective Opposition.</p>

<p>&quot;Jim Anderton who has worked seamlessly with Labour over nine years in Government has agreed to continue formal cooperation with Labour and will be agriculture spokesperson.</p>
<p>&quot;I have attached a full list of members and the roles allocated to them, together with a brief outline on the background of new caucus members.</p>
<p>&quot;The team is ready to get to work immediately. We will be a constructive Opposition willing to work with other parties including those in Government where it is in the interests of New Zealand to do so. We will however also perform the role of holding the Government to account. This will be necessary as we have already seen within days of the election, the National Party backtracking on its election promises such as in the area of the emissions trading scheme&quot;, Phil Goff said.</p>
