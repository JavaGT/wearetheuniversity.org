<p>UC appoints new Chancellor</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury Council has elected a new Chancellor and Pro-Chancellor for 2009.</p>
<p>Mr Rex Williams succeeds retiring Chancellor Dr Robin Mann who has held the post since 2003. Dr John Wood, a retired New Zealand diplomat, has been elected Pro-Chancellor (Deputy Chancellor).</p>
<p>The Chancellor is head of the University Council, the governing body of the University responsible for the oversight of the institution&#39;s policy, degree, financial and capital matters.</p>
<p>Mr Williams, who is the current Pro-Chancellor, has been a Council member since 2006. He is a Canterbury University alumnus, graduating BE (Hons) in 1967. He has 30 years of management and governance experience in New Zealand, Australia and South East Asia, retiring from the role of managing director of Holcim New Zealand in mid-2007.</p>
<p>Mr Williams is currently the chairman of the West Coast District Health Board, an advisor to HW Richardson Group Ltd and a trustee of the Water rights Trust and the Styx Living Laboratory Trust.</p>
<p>Since joining the University Council, Mr Williams has served on the Finance Planning and Resources Committee and the Audit and Risk Committee and currently chairs the Finance Committee.</p>
<p>Dr Wood was Ambassador to the USA between 1994 and 1998, and 2002 and 2006. During his 37-year public service career he was also New Zealand’s High Commissioner to Pakistan, Ambassador to Iran and Turkey, worked as International Adviser to the Prime Minister and held diplomatic postings in Japan and Germany.</p>
<p>He was twice Deputy Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and led many trade delegations. These included delegations to the WTO (World Trade Organisation) and the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development).</p>
<p>Dr Wood graduated from Canterbury with an MA (first class honours) in 1964 and was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University in 2006.</p>
