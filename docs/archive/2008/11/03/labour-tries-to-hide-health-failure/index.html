<p>Tony Ryall MP<br>National Party Health Spokesman</p>
<p>3 November 2008</p>
<p>Labour tries to hide health failure</p>
<p>National Party Health spokesman Tony Ryall says papers showing health services in the country&#39;s north are under critical or major pressure are the tip of an iceberg.</p>
<p>&quot;This information would not have been released before the election. New Zealanders expect their Government to confront and fix the problems, not hide them.&quot;</p>
<p>The confidential report by the four northern district health boards to the Health Ministry&#39;s national capital committee on long-term planning for facilities and services flags serious problems, particularly in emergency departments, and highlights critical workforce shortages.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has no plan to deal with the workforce crisis, because up until the middle of this year they were refusing to accept there was any problem at all.</p>
<p>&quot;A responsible Government wouldn&#39;t have tried to hide these problems, it would have started to deal with them sooner.&#39;</p>
<p>The report shows:</p>
<p>* Shortages of cardiothoracic intensive care nurses.</p>
<p>* Shortages of nurses, midwives, medical and radiation cancer specialists, kidney staff and other health workers has a number of services &quot;challenged to deliver appropriate levels of service&quot;.</p>
<p>* Shortages of resident medical officers [junior doctors].</p>
<p>* A shortage of operating theatre capacity and/or support facilities like intensive care beds.</p>
<p>* Growing demand for medical imaging in the face of increasing workforce shortages.</p>

<p>&quot;Labour has done 55 workforce reports since it came to office. David Cunliffe&#39;s most recent response is that he boldly plans to get a different group of bureaucrats to do another report. This is nuts.</p>
<p>&quot;After nine-long years, an extra $6 billion a year, and thousands of new bureaucrats - New Zealanders deserve better.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ryall says National has been rolling out a comprehensive strategy for dealing with the health workforce crisis, which includes the voluntary bonding of doctors, nurses and midwives in hard-to-staff areas and specialities.</p>
