<p>A Vote for the Maori Party is a Vote for Papatuanuku</p>
<p>Angeline Greensill, Hauraki-Waikato Candidate for the Maori Party Monday 3 November 2008</p>
<p>The Maori Party is thrilled to receive an 87% rating from ‘Vote for the Environment’ supported by Greenpeace and ECO.</p>
<p>“The Maori Party is absolutely committed to taking the measures necessary to ensure the wellbeing and future good health of the environment” said Angeline Greensill, Environment spokesperson for the Maori Party.</p>
<p>“For over 1000 years whanau, and hapu have been the custodians over the lands, mountains, waterways, and air space within each tribal area” said Greensill “so we were not at all surprised that we have scored well on environmental leadership, and in fact scored the best of any party on cleaning up New Zealand’s waterways”.</p>
<p>“The joint media statement expressed surprise at our result, because we voted against &#39;environmental legislation&#39; (Emissions Trading Scheme). Of course we opposed the ETS because it is ineffective, and because polluters are subsidised while householders and small businesses pay the price. We want an Emissions Reduction Programme, not an Emissions Trading Scheme&quot; said Greensill.</p>
<p>“What has surprised us however, is the dismal result that both major parties scored – with Labour receiving a 45% grading and National 27%” said Greensill.</p>
<p>“How either of these parties can profess to having national leadership ambitions when their environmental commitments appear so weak is obviously a worry” said Greensill.</p>

<p>“We note the conclusion from the Joint Media Statement that the main parties will need to have our influence, alongside that of the Greens, if they are to make real progress” said Mrs Greensill.</p>
<p>“As custodians tangata whenua have looked after the environment to the best of their ability so all can benefit” said Mrs Greensill. “We are duty bound in respect of our commitment to a Treaty-based relationship to continue to reflect the leadership that whanau, hapu and iwi have shown in caring for the environment if the current generations are to survive into the next century”.</p>
<p>Extracts from 2008 Maori Party Environmental Policy</p>
<p>We are concerned about the impact our use of our natural resources is having on land and water, as well as the air.</p>
<p>We promote the regeneration and revitalisation of freshwater marine life, protection of flora and fauna, utilisation of better wetlands; and in the case of lakes and lagoons, restore raupo, nourish beaches and sand dunes.</p>
<p>We will protect natural values and care for streams, lakes, rivers and waterways from agricultural, industrial and domestic waste. We must protect our land from the production, release and disposal of toxic and hazardous waste and promote freedom from ecological destruction.</p>
<p>Issues around water must include the mana whenua, including water rights and privatisation. Treaty claims to water ownership and interests in fresh water must be resolved in the review of the Resource Management Act</p>
<p>• Improved public transport which results in reduced emissions. We also support the development of sustainable building practices and the use of emission-free vehicles.</p>
<p>• Request the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment to urgently convene cross-party discussions to assess the impact of peak-oil production on Aotearoa.</p>
<p>• Moratorium on 1080 drops.</p>
<p>• Mitigate the impact of emissions pricing on low and modest income consumers by developing options for affordable and sustainable energy services for householders</p>
<p>• We promote the appropriate development of renewable energy resources, including geothermal and hydro, wave, wind and solar, in order to protect and preserve limited resources such as oil, gas and coal.</p>
<p>• We support the Department of Conservation in working with local hapu and iwi to transfer the kaitiakitanga role back to tangata whenua.</p>
