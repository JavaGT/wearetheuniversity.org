<p><strong>Monday, 3 November 2008, 9:30 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Anne Tolley MP<br>National Party Education Spokeswoman</p>
<p>3 November 2008</p>
<p>Labour has botched school property</p>
<p>&quot;Chris Carter should get out and visit more schools,&quot; says National Party Education spokeswoman Anne Tolley in response to the Minister&#39;s ridiculous defence of Labour&#39;s failure to upgrade school property.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Carter can&#39;t have been to many schools if he thinks Labour&#39;s school property programme is adequate. There are parents and teachers up and down New Zealand who will disagree with him.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Tolley is commenting on Chris Carter&#39;s claim that the half-a-billion-dollar school property boost announced by John Key is &#39;me too&#39; and unnecessary.</p>
<p>&quot;Shame on you Mr Carter. You know you&#39;re misleading New Zealanders.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Tolley says Upper Hutt, where the National Party Leader made the commitment to school property, is a good example of Labour&#39;s failure.</p>
<p>&quot;For years Labour has promised these schools more money for structural issues - yet they&#39;ve been fighting with the Ministry and have got nothing for this.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s why Upper Hutt College and Fergusson Intermediate have felt the need to write to the Minister directly in the past week pleading for more money.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Tolley would welcome any Labour policy for education, but unfortunately apart from the odd ad hoc announcement, the party&#39;s policy web page says: &#39;Labour&#39;s detailed policy for the next parliamentary term and beyond will be released closer to the election&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Carter had better get a wriggle on.</p>

<p>&quot;The opening of the books revealed Labour hasn&#39;t made the funding commitments needed to keep up with future school property needs, with a funding hole of at least $429 million over the next three years.</p>
<p>&quot;If Labour&#39;s now saying they have budgeted for the shortfall, Mr Carter should explain where the money is coming from, along with the funding for Labour&#39;s 30 or so other promises made since the PREFU.&quot;</p>
