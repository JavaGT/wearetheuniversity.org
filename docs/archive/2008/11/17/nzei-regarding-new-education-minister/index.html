<p>NZEI Confident Of Building Constructive Relationship With New Education Minister</p>
<p>The country’s largest education sector union congratulates Anne Tolley on her appointment as Minister of Education and hopes the new National government will follow a steady and moderate course for education.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa represents 49,000 teachers, principals and education workers who work to deliver quality teaching and learning to tens of thousands of New Zealand children.</p>
<p>It wants to ensure New Zealand has an education system which values school support staff, recruits and retains quality teachers, provides adequate school resourcing, ensures more access to quality early childhood education, focuses on teaching not testing, supports Maori medium education, and addresses issues around child poverty which impact on a child’s ability to learn.</p>
<p>NZEI President Frances Nelson says she hopes NZEI can build on the solid working relationship it had with Anne Tolley during her time in opposition.</p>
<p>“Anne Tolley made it a priority to travel around the country meeting and engaging with as many people as possible in the education sector. She gave clear signals that she is willing to work constructively, seek advice, listen and talk through the issues. I am confident she will continue that approach as Minister.”</p>
<p>NZEI welcomes the appointment of Pita Sharples as an Associate Education Minister. He is an NZEI fellow and an educational innovator who will bring a valued voice for Maori education to the portfolio.</p>
<p>It acknowledges the hard work of ACT MP Heather Roy, who takes on the other Associate Education Minister role. However it has concerns over an education working group which ACT has negotiated as part of its agreement with National, and its intention to put bulk funding back on the agenda.</p>
