<p><strong>Thursday, 13 November 2008, 9:28 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Student_Choice">Student Choice</a></strong></p>
<p>New Government Must Grant Students Their Freedom</p>
<p>Media Release: Student Choice<br>11 November 2008<br> <br>Student Choice congratulates John Key and the National Party for their victory in last Saturday&#39;s General Election.</p>
<p>With ACT likely to have a role in supporting the government, Student Choice spokesman Mike Heine today reminded the National Party that a bill exists in the name of ACT Deputy Leader Heather Roy to extend voluntary membership to student unions.</p>
<p>&quot;For too long students have missed out on the fundamental freedom of voluntary unionism, enjoyed by every other sector in our society,&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>
<p>&quot;National would do well to remember that during the election campaign, the New Zealand Union of Student Associations (NZUSA) campaigned heavily for the parties of the left, and against a National Government. NZUSA is an organisation financed by member associations which are in turn compulsorily funded by students - a direct result of compulsory student union membership.<br> <br>&quot;NZUSA&#39;s constant attacks on the National Party and demands for a universal student allowance were made by them &quot;on behalf of students&quot;.  This election result makes a mockery of their claims and proves beyond doubt that students do not speak with a unified voice on any issue.  It is degrading to us to pretend that we do.</p>
<p>&quot;Student Choice is encouraged by discussions with key figures in the National Party prior to the election, and look forward to this dialogue continuing,&quot; Mr Heine said.</p>
