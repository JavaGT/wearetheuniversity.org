<p>Hon Chris Carter<br>Education Spokesperson  </p>
<p>4 November 2008 Media Statement<br>Labour’s Education plan – for the future</p>
<p>Labour’s Education Minister Chris Carter says Schools Plus forms the basis of Labour’s Education policy, released today, and that it also includes good news for small rural schools.</p>
<p>Labour’s plan for the future of New Zealand education shows a firm commitment to rolling-out Schools Plus; ensuring that small sole charge rural schools have a minimum of two teachers; addressing issues of low-pay among school support staff; continuing to increase operational grants for all state and state-integrated schools; and increasing investment in special education.</p>
<p>“New Zealand has an education system that ranks among the best in the developed world. The last nine years has given us a great deal to be proud of, but there are still challenges ahead and Labour has a plan to meet those challenges head-on,” said Chris Carter.</p>
<p>“The challenge for our compulsory schooling system is to build on our success to date so that students at all levels learn in a modern, relevant and personalised education system that gives them the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century.”</p>
<p>Schools Plus is Labour’s flagship policy for the future of secondary education in this country. The policy will significantly reform our secondary school system, offering all young New Zealanders a stronger educational foundation. Labour has committed to fully funding Schools Plus at an estimated cost of $170m per year.</p>
<p>Small rural schools are set to benefit from Labour’s adjustment of existing staffing rules to ensure that all schools have a minimum of two full-time teaching staff. There are currently 98 schools around New Zealand operating with fewer than two full-time equivalent teaching positions.</p>
<p>Support staff that work alongside teachers are essential to making our schools function effectively. Low paid support staff will be receiving a &#39;pay jolt&#39; under Labour.</p>
<p>Schools operations grants have increased by 37 per cent since 1999 and Labour is making a further commitment to continued increases in schools’ operational funding.</p>
<p>Labour will improve the provision of Special Education support by increasing the resources invested in special education funds for children with moderate to high needs.</p>
<p>“Every New Zealander knows the importance of investing in our young people. Labour shares those values and has a report card that any mum and dad would be proud of,” said Chris Carter.</p>
