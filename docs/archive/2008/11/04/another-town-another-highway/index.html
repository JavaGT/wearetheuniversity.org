<p>Another town, another highway</p>
<p>The Green Party today warned communities along the path of John Key&#39; s election schedule to cancel all appointments with the would-be Prime<br>Minister or risk having a multi-lane highway fast-tracked through their town.</p>
<p>&quot;John Key seems to think all the world&#39;s problems can be solved by fast-tracking the building of a multi-lane road,&quot; Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons says.</p>
<p>&quot;First stop, the Waikato ($750 million), now Tauranga ($100 million). If Key announced his schedule, towns would at least have a chance to cancel all appointments with him before he announces a new motorway through their community.</p>
<p>&quot;I strongly recommend to the quiet communities of Eastbourne, Takaka and Opotiki that they check their diary&#39;s for the next few days and cancel any appointments they might have with Key, before they find their parks and backyards have been inadvertently volunteered for a massive new highway.</p>
