<p>Labour leads with more medical students</p>
<p>Minister of Health David Cunliffe today announced $12 million over the next five years to help fund additional training places for postgraduate medical students.</p>
<p>In 2004 the Government announced 40 additional medical student places had made available, those students will now move into postgraduate medical training from December this year.</p>
<p>“This government has twice lifted the number of training places for doctors during its time in government and I am delighted to announce funding today for their postgraduate study.</p>
<p>“This group of students are tomorrows, GPs, surgeons, oncologists and paediatricians.”</p>
<p>Mr Cunliffe said the Government had committed to increasing the number of doctors working in New Zealand and lifting the number of training places would benefit the country for years to come.</p>
<p>“Lifting the number of training places by 80 over the last five years is just one of the commitments we have made to building a sustainable workforce.”</p>
<p>The Labour Party has also promised to lift medical students by a further 50 places by 2010 and further 50 places has also been pledged for 2011.</p>
<p>“ I believe that report along with the Senior Doctors and Junior Doctors workforce commission findings will be critical in establishing a path forward to create a national training structure for doctors .“</p>
