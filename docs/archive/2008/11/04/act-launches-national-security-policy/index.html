<p>Press Release</p>
<p>ACT Launches National Security Policy</p>
<p>Heather Roy MP</p>
<p>Tuesday, November 4 2008</p>
<p>ACT Deputy Leader and National Security Spokesman Heather Roy today launched ACT New Zealand&#39;s National Security policy at the Australian Defence College Centre for Defence and Strategic Studies.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the past three years, ACT has taken - rather than simply talked about - a &#39;whole-of-government&#39; approach to ensuring both the internal and external safety of New Zealand and its citizens,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT&#39;s policy ( <a href="http://www.roy.org.nz/royters/act-launches-national-security-policy">www.roy.org.nz/royters/act-launches-national-security-policy</a>) will form the basis of ACT&#39;s White Paper on International Relations and National Security, a statement of ACT&#39;s direction and purpose.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a substantial and comprehensive piece of work and the culmination of the efforts of dozens of people over three years: groups I have visited, and discussions I have had with a variety of people in security-based organisations, the Defence Force, academics and my own National Security advisor.</p>
<p>My own experiences as a territorial soldier in the NZ Army have also been invaluable when contemplating the effect of policy at the grass-roots level.</p>
<p>&quot;Keeping Kiwis safe both abroad and at home is the most important role of Government. ACT&#39;s policy is a road map toward turning New Zealand back into a safe and prosperous nation in which we can raise our children and grandchildren,&quot; Mrs Roy said.</p>
