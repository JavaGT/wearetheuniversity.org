<p>Education Policy Acknowledges Low Paid Workers</p>
<p>The education union NZEI Te Riu Roa is pleased to see its campaign for fair pay in the education sector, reflected in Labour&#39;s just released schools policy.</p>
<p>The Labour led government has already announced it will deliver a pay jolt to low paid school support staff, when they go into pay negotiations next year.</p>
<p>In its schools policy, it is also pledging to ensure that schools can get help with administration tasks so that principals can focus more on students and on providing educational leadership in schools. NZEI believes this acknowledges both the critical leadership role of principals, and the value of frontline support staff in effective school management.</p>
<p>NZEI President Frances Nelson says &quot;administration support for principals would enable principals to exercise the educational and professional leadership that schools need to deliver high quality programmes for every learner.&quot;</p>
<p>A promise by Labour to increase operational funding is also welcome. However NZEI says neither of the main parties has given any detail about exactly how much additional operational funding they would make available, and how meaningful it would be.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a rush of education policy just days out from the election, but without more detail and costings, it is difficult to know what shape these policies would actually take. The release of policies by both Labour and National this close to the election, doesn&#39;t give people enough information or time to make considered decisions before they vote,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
