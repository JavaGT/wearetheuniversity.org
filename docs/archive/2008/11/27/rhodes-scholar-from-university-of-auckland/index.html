<h3>Rhodes Scholar from University of Auckland</h3>
<p><img src="http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/0811/f95d6ea2478cb18c940d.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>A political studies graduate from The University of Auckland keenly interested in global justice and migration from developing countries has gained a coveted Rhodes Scholarship for 2009.</p>
<p>Nina Hall was chosen as one of three Rhodes Scholars from New Zealand following interviews with shortlisted candidates at Government House in Auckland yesterday.</p>
<p>The scholarships, held at Oxford University, have long been among the most prestigious to which university graduates wanting to pursue further study abroad can aspire.</p>
<p>Nina, 23, recently finished an MA with a thesis on engendering democracy in Timor-Leste. She examined how the UN, international and local NGOs promoted gender equality in this new nation and post- conflict state. Her BA honours dissertation was on immigration policies in New Zealand and Chile.</p>
<p>She held undergraduate and masters/honours scholarships at The University of Auckland, and was top Senior Scholar in History in 2005.</p>
<p>At Oxford, where she will start next September, Nina plans to take a doctoral degree on how migration has become a global issue that needs a global response, rather than simply at the state level.</p>
<p>&quot;Managing immigration is one of the major global challenges facing the world&#39;s leaders today,&quot; she says.</p>

<p>&quot;While capitalism has led to the free flow of goods and services, it has not led to a free flow of labour. This is problematic for those fleeing conflict, persecution and a lack of economic opportunities.&quot;</p>
<p>Her DPhil thesis will examine how states &quot;construct&quot; certain immigrants as illegal in order to deport them.</p>
<p>Nina&#39;s interest in immigration stems from her experiences overseas. Aged 17 she lived for a year with an Italian family in rural Sicily close to where many African illegal immigrants were &quot;literally washed up&quot; on the coast.</p>
<p>In 2006 she spent six months studying at L&#39;Institut de Sciences Politiques in Paris and wrote an essay on &quot;les sans- papiers&quot; (immigrants without official papers) who exert political influence in France.</p>
<p>In Auckland Nina has worked with the refugee community, and been active on campus in environmental and sustainable transport issues. She was also the co-ordinator of the Auckland regional Young Greens.</p>
<p>Last year she went on a course on Leadership in Global Society at the University of Virginia. Tomorrow she departs for Nepal where she will be volunteering as an intern with UNICEF. She has just completed a two-month internship at the Department of Political Affairs at the United Nations headquarters.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel very honoured and humbled to be a Rhodes Scholar, and to be a part of such an extraordinary community,&quot; says Nina. &quot;Studying at Oxford will be a great opportunity to bring together my academic work and my practical experience at the UN. I&#39;m really looking forward to meeting students and academics from around the world.</p>
<p>&quot;After Oxford my intention is to work for the New Zealand government or in an international organisation be it the UN or an NGO. I am committed to contributing to New Zealand&#39;s place in the world.&quot;</p>
