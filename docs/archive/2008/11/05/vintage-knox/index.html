<p>5 November 2008</p>
<p>VUP press release</p>
<p>immediate</p>
<p>It’s been 10 years since the award-winning “The Vintner’s Luck” was published. Victoria University Press is proud to publish a strictly limited edition of 1000 copies to celebrate.</p>
<p>This signed, numbered edition is beautifully designed by the acclaimed designer Sarah Maxey and printed with skill and craft by Printlink in Petone.</p>
<p>Casebound, with ribbon and dustjacket, the production is sumptuous.</p>
<p>Along with this lovely celebratory edition of “The Vintner’s Luck”, we’re releasing a collection of Elizabeth’s non-fiction “The Love School: Personal Essays”.</p>
<p>The writing throughout displays the vivid particularity and rich music for which she is renowned, and a number of pieces take surprising imaginative turns: when the fevered author encounters an angelic stranger in a Venetian back street, for instance, or when Elvis Presley encounters St Jerome’s lion.</p>
<p>Both books are published on Friday 7 November.</p>
<p>Please contact Heather McKenzie 027 563 6531 <a href="mailto:heather.mckenzie@vuw.ac.nz">heather.mckenzie@vuw.ac.nz</a> to arrange an interview with Elizabeth, for more information or to receive a review copy of “The Love School”.</p>
