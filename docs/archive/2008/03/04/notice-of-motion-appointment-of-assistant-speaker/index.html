<p>Notice of Motion: Appointment of Assistant Speaker &#39;That Hon Marian Leslie Hobbs be appointed Assistant Speaker&#39;</p>
<p>Te Ururoa Flavell, Member of Parliament for Waiariki</p>
<p>Tuesday 4 March 2008</p>
<p>Tena koe Madam Speaker, tena tatou katoa.</p>
<p>When this Notice of Motion appeared on the Order Paper, I noticed an increased interest in the proceedings of the House, from the honourable Member for Te Tai Tokerau, Mr Hone Harawira.</p>
<p>As someone who enthusiastically studies Standing Orders, Standing Order 30 really got him going.</p>
<p>It describes the criteria for the appointment of an Assistant Speaker as being limited only by the constraints that no member who is the leader of a party, or who holds the office as whip, are able to be appointed to this role.</p>
<p>In the case of the Maori Party, that meant we only had one potential nominee for the role - Mr Hone Harawira.</p>
<p>And so I come to this debate today, obviously disappointed that the expertise of Mr Harawira has been overlooked - but also, on behalf of the Maori Party to express our best wishes to the Honourable Marian Hobbs for the opportunity to hold office during the remaining term of Parliament.</p>
<p>In doing so, I do want to also convey our appreciation to Ann Hartley, for the contribution she brought to the Chamber as she negotiated, cajoled, conducted and directed the proceedings of this House.</p>
<p>We wish her every success in her role as a North Shore City Councillor. Her experience both as a former Mayor of Birkenhead, and the last eight years in national politics, will no doubt be of huge benefit to regional politics and we wish her and her whanau well.</p>

<p>Madam Speaker, regarding this Notice of Motion, the Maori Party is happy to support the proposal for Marian Hobbs to take on the role of Assistant Speaker.</p>
<p>It is always interesting for me, as a former school Principal, to see the influence of educationalists in this chamber.</p>
<p>As I understand it, Marian has been involved in playcentre management, has been a Principal of Girls Colleges in Christchurch and Wellington, has been a Co-Founder of the alternative education centre of Four Avenues; has been on the Canterbury University Council and countless community ventures.</p>
<p>I believe that presiding over the debate in this Chamber will pretty come as a breeze to anyone who has been charged with motivating secondary school students to stay awake during class.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, we&#39;ve watched Marian working alongside Mark Blumsky on Wellington issues - such as the Karori Sanctuary - and hope that the capacity to put aside party political positions will be a priority for her role as Assistant Speaker.</p>
<p>We hope too, that the varied life experiences she brings to the floor - including her association with the Chippenham commune and the Quaker Movement - will be influential in encouraging peaceful and respectful debate in this House.</p>
<p>Tena koe Marian. Nei ra nga mihi o te törangapü Maori ki a koe kua eke ki tënei o nga taumata o te Whare Paremata. Maku a Hone Harawira e korero, kia tau tana wairua, kia ngäwari ai te ngau o mamae na tana kore whiwhi i tera o nga turu. Kia kaha ra.</p>
<p>Congratulations Marian. We of the Maori Party wish you well having achieved this significant role in Parliament. I will speak to Hone, settle him down, ease his pain at having not achieved the position. Best of luck.</p>
<p>Finally, Madam Speaker, I want to use this opportunity to welcome the new List MP to this Chamber, Louisa Hareruia Wall</p>
<p>Ko Tongariro te maunga Ko Taupo te moana Ko Tutemohuta te hapu Ko Pakira te marae Ko Ngati Tuwharetoa te iwi Ko Te Heuheu te tangata.</p>
