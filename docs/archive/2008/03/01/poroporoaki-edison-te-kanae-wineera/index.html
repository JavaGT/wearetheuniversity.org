<p>Friday 29 February 2008</p>
<p>&quot;Aue taukuri e. Kua hinga tenei uri o Ngati Toa tenei tama o te Hokowhitu a Tumatauenga.</p>
<p>Haere ake e te rangatira, takahia te ara kua takahina e era hoa, whanaunga au i hinga i te mura o te ahi.</p>
<p>Haere atu ki a ratau kei te po&quot; .</p>
<p>The Maori Party today laments the passing of 28th Maori Battalion warrior, Edison Te Kanae Wineera.</p>
<p>“The 28th Maori Battalion warriors occupy a special hold in our hearts, for their staunch leadership, their courage and their bravery in World War Two” said Tariana Turia, Member of Parliament for Te Tai Hauauru and Co-leader of the Maori Party.</p>
<p>“We share with Ngati Toa Rangatira, our deepest sorrow in the passing of the last of the 28th Maori Battalion warriors from Ngati Toa” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“Edison, a direct descendant of Te Raurapaha, has served his people well” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“Indeed, he honoured us all with his efforts as part of Company D, a legacy that is immortalised in the production, ‘A Journey to the other side of the world’”.</p>
<p>“The courage demonstrated on foreign soils continued to inspire us, with Edison’s lifelong and devoted contribution across the community” said Mrs Turia .</p>
<p>“Whether as parents of ‘B Dorm’ at Church College, or as kaumatua of their beloved Takapuwahia marae, Edison and his beautiful wife, Myra, have drawn people close to them over the decades and their children, and children’s children will all be mourning the loss of such a proud and noble man” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“We express our deepest sympathies to the kuia, Myra, to their three children and all of their mokopuna, and to the wider Wineera whanau, in the passing of such a cherished man”.</p>
<p>Postscript</p>
<p>A Journey to the Other side of the World will be screened at the Maori Battalion Reunion to be held in Gisborne this Easter.</p>
