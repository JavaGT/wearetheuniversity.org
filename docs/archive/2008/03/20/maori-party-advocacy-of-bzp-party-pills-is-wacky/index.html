<p>Shane Jones<br>List Member of Parliament<br>Media Statement</p>
<p>19 March 2008</p>
<p>Maori Party advocacy of BZP party pills is wacky</p>
<p>The Maori Party’s advocacy for the continued sale of BZP-based party pills is a completely “wacky” stance and totally “anti-Maori” says Northland Labour List MP Shane Jones.</p>
<p>Parliament passed the bill banning BZP-based party pills into law last week by 109-11 vote ensuring it comes into effect on April 1.<br>Under the new law, manufacturers and retailers have till April 1 2008 to stop making and selling BZP-based party pills. Consumers will have six months from</p>
<p>April 1 2008 to use any pills they have for personal use. This is a new threshold date, changed to give certainty to those using, selling, or making BZP-based party pills.</p>
<p>“I find it incredulous that Hone Harawira (Te Tai Tokerau) voted against this bill when overwhelmingly studies show these drugs -- and that is what they are – are having a disastrous effect on young Maori.</p>
<p>“A 2006 Massey University study found that 1-in-5 of the Maori had used these pills and; more Maori than non-Maori were taking them,” Mr Jones said.</p>
<p>“To make it worse the vulnerable youth who take these drugs reported feeling a lack of vitality, negative effect on their health and; a negative outlook on life.</p>
<p>“BZP users have widely said that one of its main attractions is that it is legal, cheap and easily accessible however, expert advice says a large number of people are not likely to continue to seek it once it is harder to get.”</p>

<p>Mr Jones said perhaps Mr Harawira has become disorientated from wandering around in the Australia outback recently and forgotten that he was meant to be working for Maori in Te Tai Tokerau.</p>
<p>“He has started to hallucinate from spending too much time under the Australian sun. Hopefully he will get better soon and realise that banning party pills is good for our Maori youth,” Mr Jones said.</p>
