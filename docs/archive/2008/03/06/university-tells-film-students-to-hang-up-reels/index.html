<p>University tells film students to hang up reels</p>
<p>Wednesday, 5th March 2008</p>
<p>Victoria University students today protested at the University’s proposed plan to close the Film School. 80 angry students protested outside the Hunter Building before heading up to the Vice Chancellor’s Office.</p>
<p>VUWSA President, Joel Cosgrove said; “The University, once again shows that it doesn’t take the interests of students seriously.”</p>
<p>“This is farcical! It’s like the music school turning around and telling students to put away their trombones and only read about them instead.”</p>
<p>“There are lots of concerned students out there worrying about whether they can finish their degree in its current form,” says Cosgrove.</p>
<p>Having sat through the attempt to explain away the cuts, Cosgrove feels, “The process is flawed, there is no thought put into this ‘change’ document.”</p>
<p>“David Mackay [Deputy Vice-Chancellor] has stated that this it is not a financial decision and yet they can provide no other plausible reason,” added Cosgrove</p>
<p>Concerns were raised during the rally about the lack of notice given, “International students who came to Wellington are among the most annoyed that the programme that attracted them is to be scrapped. They can’t just go home, but I guess the University didn’t think of that,” says Cosgrove.</p>
<p>David Mackay agreed, after meeting 60 students who gathered outside the Vice Chancellor’s Office to a meeting, “We’re happy to take up the opportunity to meet with the University next week to ensure that students have their voices heard.”</p>
