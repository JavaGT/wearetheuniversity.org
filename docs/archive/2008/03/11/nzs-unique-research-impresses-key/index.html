<p>NZ’s ‘unique research’ impresses Key</p>
<p>The National caucus takes science and research in New Zealand “very seriously”, said Opposition Leader John Key at Lincoln University today (10 March).</p>
<p>There was some “unique research” that had to take place in New Zealand related to the country’s land-based strengths and such work was to be encouraged, he said.</p>
<p>Mr Key spent two hours at the University accompanied by fellow National MPs Gerry Brownlee, David Carter and Paul Hutchison. It was the National Leader’s first official visit to the campus.</p>
<p>The group heard presentations from Professor Caroline Saunders on the Food Miles issue, Associate Professor Susanne Becken on Peak Oil, Climate Change and Tourism, and from Professor Keith Cameron and Professor Hong Di on nitrate and nitrous oxide amelioration on agricultural land through the use of the eco-n technology, developed as a result of their research leadership.</p>
<p>Mr Key took a keen interest in the Lincoln University research. He quizzed Professor Saunders on the weighting of consumer attitudes he had noted in Britain concerning the “meat chop” on British dinner plates against concern for the carbon emissions and environmental impacts involved in its production.</p>
<p>On the Peak Oil issue he asked Associate Professor Becken about the impact of oil use transfer away from areas such heating, a big user in the USA. Would transfers free up and appreciable volume of oil for other use, he asked?</p>
<p>Associate Professor Becken said the shape of the oil-use curve would stay the same. Transfers would simply extend it out a bit. It would prolong the supply but not indefinitely, she said.</p>
