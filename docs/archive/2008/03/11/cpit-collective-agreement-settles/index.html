<p>CPIT Collective Agreement Settles</p>
<p>Association of Staff in Tertiary Education (ASTE) members at Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (CPIT) voted overwhelmingly today in favour of ratifying a new collective agreement after an agreement was put forward by both parties for a ‘rollover’ deal in addition to salary increases for 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p>Union members approached the polytechnic late last year and suggested the rollover as a way to avoid the conflicts of the past years. This was seen as particularly important as CPIT moves towards its new form as agreed with the Tertiary Education Commission as part of the tertiary education reforms.</p>
<p>ASTE National President Tangi Tipene said today, “The CEO of CPIT (Neil Barnes) clearly supported the union’s view that changes are best made in an environment of goodwill rather than that of friction and adversity”. She went on to say, “ASTE members were very pleased with the decision by the union to negotiate a rollover and felt able to accept a salary increase that, while they might feel it should be more, is acceptable to both parties”. She added that the salary increases of 3.5% for 2008 and a further 3.5% for 2009 will at least keep members’ salaries up with the movement of the CPI. “This deal reflects the bargaining strength of our members and the good sense and goodwill of the CPIT management” Ms Tipene said.</p>
