<p>18 March 2008 Media Statement<br>Jones decries Maori Party condoning body snatching</p>
<p>Calls by the Maori Party for whanau, not the Government, to resolve body snatching incidents have been questioned by the Labour Maori caucus acting-chair Shane Jones.</p>
<p>He is referring to comments by Maori Party co-leader Pita Sharples who is advocating the law around body-snatching should not change and, that whanau, not the coroners should decide what should be done.</p>
<p>“We need to consult Maori over this issue. We need to hold a summit Hui with church leaders, kaumatuas, and others to discuss this issue,” said Mr Jones.</p>
<p>“Body-snatching is becoming an increasing problem. It is causing families’ soul-destroying heartbreak, and for the Maori Party just to say that we keep things as they are are just isn’t right.</p>
<p>“We’re a far more cosmopolitan country now and we have to respect all people, but most of all we must respect the wishes of the dead and their immediate families.”</p>
<p>Under current law a person cannot be charged with theft of a body as there is no property in a human body, although charges can be laid over the indignity to a dead human body.</p>
<p>However, the taking of a casket can be deemed as theft and there&#39;s also the possibility of an offence over the indignity caused to a dead human body.</p>
<p>A law change has been floated by acting chief coroner Wallace Bain which would give coroners exclusive authority over bodies in the case of all deaths.</p>

<p>Justice Minister Annette King, will be discussing the issue of updating burial law in May when she meets with the Law Commission.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Justice is also examining the issue and will advise Ms King on possible changes to the law,” he said.</p>
<p>“This is a complex issue and although a law change may not stop people from body-snatching it could save thousands of dollars in legal fees for whanau involved,” Mr Jones said.</p>
