<p><strong>Wednesday, 19 March 2008, 3:24 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_Students_Association">Auckland University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>19 March 2008</p>
<p>Students vote loudly, and resoundingly, NO to the elimination of open entry</p>
<p>In their first real chance to have their say on the issue of open entry, Auckland students have shown overwhelming opposition to the elimination of open entry from the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>AUSA put the item of open entry for discussion at its Autumn General Meeting for all students this afternoon. The General Meeting, as well as a referendum, is constitutionally the highest decisionmaking body of the Association.</p>
<p>“This was the first real chance for students to show they feel about eliminating open entry. They voted overwhelmingly, and loudly, no,” says AUSA President David Do.</p>
<p>“We’re really pleased about the mandate students have given us this afternoon. This confirms the position the Executive has held since November last year, when the University moved to restrict entry to all remaining qualifications from 2009,” says AUSA Education Vice President Sophia Blair. Over 250 students packed the Quad for the meeting. Hundreds of students voted almost unanimously for the following motions:</p>
<p>THAT AUSA condemns the University for its complete failure to adequately consult and discuss the issues of admissions and limited entry with its most important stakeholders, students. THAT AUSA opposes the elimination of open entry from the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>THAT this General Meeting supports AUSA, if necessary, undertaking legal action (through judicial or administrative review, legal injunction, or equivalent actions) against the University in order to secure an appropriate process for considering the issues of student admission and selection, and secure fair processes of student admission into the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>Professor Margaret Mutu of the Maori Studies Department also spoke to the crowd regarding the motions, saying that the power is in students’ hands on this issue. “AUSA will act accordingly with the mandate of students,” says David Do, AUSA President.</p>
