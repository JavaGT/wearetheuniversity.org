<p>Dr Paul Hutchison MP<br>National Party Tertiary Education Spokesman</p>
<p>19 March 2008</p>
<p>TEC turnover tops 25% on the brink of change</p>
<p>Revelations today that the turnover at the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) was a massive 25.5% in the 2006/07 year does not auger well for the implementation of Labour&#39;s tertiary reforms, says National&#39;s Tertiary Education spokesman, Dr Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>&quot;At the parliamentary select committee today, TEC admitted that 2006/07 was the most disruptive year in its history.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only did the TEC shed one quarter of its total staff, but they also changed the chairman, the CEO is about to leave, and there is a new Minister.</p>
<p>&quot;This leaves very few of those responsible around to be held accountable for the reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;The 2007 OECD report on tertiary education says changes have occurred every two years and the system is complex.</p>
<p>&quot;National estimates that over $419 million has been spent by Labour on changes that have not worked. It is irresponsible that this time the Government is so poorly organised.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has demonstrated poor planning and a lack of good governance in this crucial sector at a time when it is needed most.&quot;</p>
