<p><strong>Friday, 14 March 2008, 5:13 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Bill English MP National Party Finance Spokesman</p>
<p>14 March 2008</p>
<p>&#39;Fast-forward&#39; fund - all show, no pony</p>
<p>National Party Finance spokesman Bill English says a day after National revealed the real payouts from the so-called fast-forward fund would be less than half of what was promised, Labour has confirmed it&#39;s even worse than that.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has today confirmed the fund is likely to provide only $20 million for research in its first year, a far cry from the $85 to $100 million promised by Helen Clark.</p>
<p>&quot;In a cynical attempt to grab a headline, Labour inflated the benefits of the fund to make the numbers look big. Jim Anderton has today confirmed almost nothing is certain.**</p>
<p>&quot;Labour presented the public with an heroic best case scenario, such as today&#39;s definitive claim that &#39;two thousand million dollars&#39; would be spent over the lifetime of this fund, including the &#39;thousand million&#39; which industry will stump up with. Labour is treating the public and industry as if they are stupid.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr English says National will make long-term funding commitments to science, research and development which provide certainty to the sector.</p>
<p>&quot;As National revealed yesterday, if Labour tries to deliver on its promise of $85 to $100 million a year, the fund would expire before year 10. The only way they could stretch it out to last the promised 15 years is to halve the Government payments.</p>
<p>&quot;This does not provide certainty to the sector at all. If this policy was subject the advertising standards complaints process, Labour would be guilty of false advertising.&quot;</p>
