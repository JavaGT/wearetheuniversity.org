<p><strong>Monday, 10 March 2008, 11:12 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>North Shore Hospital Concerns Continue</p>
<p>The bad news about North Shore Hospital just keeps coming. Now, Carol Wilson, the manager of North Shore Emergency Department has gone public about the overcrowding that is occurring in the summer months. She said, “My God, what’s winter going to be like?”</p>
<p>Mrs Wilson’s statements come on top of an open letter signed by 13 senior doctors which specifically said the problems related to poor planning for growth.</p>
<p>Predictable crisis<br>The current crisis was perfectly predictable. The population has been growing at expected rates. Medical technology moves ahead at expected rates. So why wasn’t the planning done? Why has the Waitemata District Health Board failed to build the second tower at North Shore Hospital when it was needed?<br>Labour’s appointee, Chair of the Waitemata District Health Board, Kay McKelvie, reiterated the commitment to opening 68 new hospital beds by September, and longer term plans for 50 more North Shore Hospital beds by 2010, more intensive care beds and 212 beds in the new tower block by 2013. It’s all a bit late. The problems were predictable years ago.<br>Lack of adequate planning<br>If everything had been properly planned we would not be seeing the crisis now, a crisis which is so bad that the Health and Disability Commissioner has launched an Inquiry into the Hospital. Since the announcement of that Inquiry, I have received numerous complaints about the quality of care received at North Shore Hospital.</p>

<p>Cunliffe’s pretence<br>This whole problem is ultimately sheeted back to the government. They provide the funding to the District Health Boards. They appoint the Chairs of the Boards. They have employed thousands of bureaucrats in the Ministry of Health to provide oversight of the Boards.</p>
<p>After eight years in office, it’s time the government took responsibility for its actions or, more accurately, its inaction. The government’s failure to plan over the years has led to the problem.</p>
<p>Government ideology fails people<br>A complete lack of foresight by Labour has led to this crisis. They have been negligent in their workforce planning. And as winter approaches this situation can only get worse. It is a symptom of Labour’s focus on bureaucracy instead of delivering service to patients. David Cunliffe should explain why, after the extra $5 billion a year Labour is spending on health, patients are not receiving better treatment sooner.</p>
