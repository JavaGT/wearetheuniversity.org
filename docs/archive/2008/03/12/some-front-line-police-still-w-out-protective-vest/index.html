<p>Chester Borrows MP<br>National Party Police Spokesman</p>

<p>Some front-line police still without protective vests</p>
<p>National Party Police spokesman Chester Borrows says it’s time the Police Minister explained exactly what was going on over the deployment of stab-resistant vests for front-line officers.</p>
<p>He says a woman who complained to a newspaper that her police officer partner had not been issued with body armour 12 months after it should have been was told by a senior officer that she ‘might like to keep quiet’ on the issue.</p>
<p>“This woman says she has no intention of staying quiet just because senior police are ‘obviously feeling uncomfortable with the public knowing that there are under-equipped staff on the street’, and I agree totally with her.</p>
<p>“I am staggered that 15 months after the announcement that all front-line police would be issued with stab-resistant vests some are still exposed to unnecessary danger every day and every night because they have do not have one.</p>
<p>“Then, as soon as someone – and an officer’s partner at that – tries to bring it to people’s attention, they try to silence her.</p>
<p>“The roll-out of these vests has been a disaster from day 1.</p>
<p>“Police need an answer from Police Minister Annette King on this issue, and they need it now.</p>
<p>“Just one officer on the front line without protective gear is one too many as far as I’m concerned,” says Mr Borrows, a former front-line officer.</p>
