<p>Press Release for Immediate Release</p>
<p>Students and Staff Save Film at Vic.</p>
<p>Monday, 5th May 2008</p>
<p>Victoria University has failed in its attempts to radically gut and restructure the Film School at Victoria as revealed in the updated change proposal.</p>
<p>Victoria University Students’ Association President Joel Cosgrove said, “This is a win for students, they stood up and forced management to listen.”</p>
<p>“Film at Vic as we know it would be gone if the students had played to management’s rules” Cosgrove added.</p>
<p>Students stopped the University’s attempts to disestablish the Film School by forcing them to hold public forums, occupying the Hunter Building and publicly marching through the University in a show of solidarity with both the students and staff affected.</p>
<p>“There was general supported by students from all faculties, they saw this as not a film school issue, but as a consultation issue,” says Cosgrove.</p>
<p>“The result of our campaign to save the film school demonstrates the need for a students’ association which is able to advocate across the board.”</p>
<p>Cosgrove added, “The key issue raised during this process was that this is not a solo act, there is a systematic attempt underway by the University, supported by Government, to take away choice and any remaining ownership of the University from staff, students and the workers who provide them the ability to exist.”</p>
