<p>Green Party Release Controversial Video</p>
<p>To Launch their new campaign “Some things are bigger than politics” the Green Party of New Zealand have released a humorous viral video through Youtube and their Green Party website.</p>
<p>The viral, created by Special Group (a recently formed Auckland based creative agency) juxtaposes the trivial and time-wasting bickering of the mainstream political parties with the work the Greens consider to be the real business of politics – improving our quality of life through policy change.</p>
<p>Over an animated image of Trevor Mallard’s head superimposed onto the body of a boxer, a voice over says,</p>
<p>“While Trevor Mallard was giving his colleague Tau Henare a bunch of fives outside parliament chambers… Jeanette Fitzsimons was hammering out a plan to get polluters to pay for the carbon they produce.”</p>
<p>There are no sacred cows as far as the Greens are concerned. Ron Marks comes under the spotlight, as does John Key for his much denied association with the Exclusive Brethren.</p>
<p>Generating power without damaging the environment, having food that is safe to eat and tackling climate change are issues, according to the Greens, that “are bigger than politics”.</p>
<p>Gary Reese, Green Party National Campaign Manager said, &quot;Digital media will be an important medium in this year’s election campaign and this neat little viral video is an effective way to convey our message.”</p>
<p>So far the video has had over a thousand hits on Youtube.</p>
<p>“You don’t need a major TV ad budget to get a message like this across,” says Tony Bradbourne of Special Group, “this is a smart and cost effective way for the Greens to make a point and establish the new campaign.”</p>
