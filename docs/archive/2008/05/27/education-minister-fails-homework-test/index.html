<p>Education Minister fails homework test</p>
<p>National Party Education spokeswoman Anne Tolley says Education Minister Chris Carter has &quot;failed to do his homework&quot; on statistics which show major problems with NCEA internal assessment.</p>
<p>&quot;Presented with figures that have been in the public domain since April, Chris Carter accused me of &#39;making up&#39; the figures and said he was briefed weekly by education officials but &#39;had never heard about such a figure&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Carter was wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Tolley is referring to information provided by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority to the media in March 2008 which found nearly a third of internal assessment marks were incorrect.</p>
<p>&quot;When I offered to table the figures for the Minister to see them himself, he didn&#39;t want to know about them.</p>
<p>&quot;Furthermore, the Education and Science Select Committee called back NZQA in their financial review to discuss these issues. NZQA admitted the stats were true, with Deputy Chief Executive Bali Haque saying &#39;the standards that we&#39;re talking about haven&#39;t been properly understood by teachers&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;When the Minister refuses to acknowledge a situation that puts in doubt the marks of up to a third of our NCEA students, you&#39;d think he&#39;d be doing his homework.&quot;</p>
