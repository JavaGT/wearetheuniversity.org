<p>Simon Power MP<br>National Party Justice &amp; Corrections Spokesman</p>
<p>27 May 2008</p>
<p>Rapist, drug dealer, robbers, run from home D</p>
<p>A rapist, an arsonist, a drug manufacturer, a drug dealer, violent robbers, burglars, and thieves all walked away from Labour&#39;s risky home detention scheme last year, says National&#39;s Justice &amp; Corrections spokesman, Simon Power.</p>
<p>Most were caught although, as at February, five were still on the run, including one burglar who had been on the run since December 2005 - a period of two years and two months.<br>Mr Power is releasing information which shows that those who absconded also included people convicted of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm, contravening a protection order, wounding with reckless disregard, and fraud.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s a very worrying list of offences.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government says these absconders represent only 2% of those on home detention, but that&#39;s not the point.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s the type of crime they&#39;ve committed and the threat they present to society by being out on home detention in the first place that I&#39;m worried about.</p>
<p>&quot;Just one of them repeating their crime while on the run is one too many.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it worth saving a few prison beds to have these people loose on our streets?</p>
<p>&quot;Many of them pose a risk to society and should not be left in a situation where they can reoffend relatively easily.</p>
<p>&quot;Figures I released several weeks ago show that 801 of the 1,517 people on home detention in 2006/07 had been convicted of either violence, sex, or drug offences.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it worth saving a prison bed to allow a former teacher to be on home detention when he has been convicted of indecent assaults against students?</p>
<p>&quot;Is it worth saving a prison bed to allow a man who admitted shaking a baby to the point of unconsciousness to be sentenced to home detention when the judge said that if it had not been for a change in the law last year, he would have no trouble sending him to jail?</p>
<p>&quot;By changing the law to allow home detention for these people, Labour has put its obsession with reducing the number of prison inmates ahead of public safety.</p>
<p>&quot;Home detention is a sentence that must be restricted to only low-level offenders who pose no direct threat to the community.&quot;</p>
