<p>Keep Taking Our Ideas Says NZ First</p>
<p>New Zealand First has congratulated National leader John Key for considering using one of its key health policies to retain doctors.</p>
<p>National is reportedly considering a policy to write off student loans for graduate doctors, under a bonding scheme to address a nationwide shortage of doctors.</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters said he was pleased that National was continually looking to the New Zealand First website for sensible ideas to solve the country’s problems.</p>
<p>“For some years we have been advocating a number of policies, including bonding and abatement of fees for medical students.</p>
<p>“We hope that both National and Labour look seriously at our ideas and we are more than willing to help bring them into effect. It works best if they acknowledge where they come from.</p>
<p>“All political parties should work for the common good,” said Mr Peters.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
<p>The New Zealand First policy reads: “review the costs of gaining initial medical qualifications, including exploring the option of a &#39;bonding&#39; system for medical students who are willing to trade-off student loan abatements for staying in New Zealand.”</p>
