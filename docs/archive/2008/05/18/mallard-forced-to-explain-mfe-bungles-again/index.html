<p>Mallard forced to explain MfE bungles - again</p>
<p>Environment Minister Trevor Mallard has been forced to admit his beleaguered Ministry has bungled again by cancelling public workshops to enable a staff member to take a jaunt to Australia, says National&#39;s Associate Environment spokeswoman, Jacqui Dean.</p>
<p>A series of public workshops for the National Standard on Ecological Flows and Water Levels, which were to be held from 30 April until 9 May, were postponed at the last minute because of a &#39;clash of timing&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;It defies belief that these important workshops were cancelled less than a week before they were due to start because a staff member involved in the workshops decided to take up the offer of a trip to Australia to talk about water management issues and indigenous values with Australian authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;Thousands of dollars have been wasted by cancelling these workshops, and the plans of all the people attending the workshops have been thrown into disarray.</p>
<p>&quot;It is simply unacceptable to bump a public consultation process because one Ministry staff member decided Australian water issues were more important.</p>
<p>&quot;Trevor Mallard says the acting chief executive has now admitted this &#39;should have been avoided&#39;. This is not good enough. His Ministry is on a continuous lurch from bungle to bungle.</p>
<p>&quot;MfE is promising to &#39;review and modify all processes to ensure this does not happen again&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s record of managing this Ministry would suggest that is unlikely&quot;.</p>
