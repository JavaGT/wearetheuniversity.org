<p>PRESS RELEASE</p>
<p>Labour Confirms Efu Koka For Otara By-Election</p>
<p>Labour has selected a 42 year old business man and Community Board Chairperson Mr Efu Koka as its candidate to contest the Otara Councillor position left vacant by former Deputy Mayor Sua William Sio who is now a Labour Member of Parliament.</p>
<p>Ruth Gordon, chairperson of the Manukau East Labour Electorate Committee says that Efu Koka has the unanimous support of the Otara Labour Party to stand for the Otara Councillor position.</p>
<p>“Efu is the right person, he’s smart, articulate, passionate &amp; hard working, and he is also a humble person. We in the Otara labour party believe that Efu is the best person for this role.”</p>
<p>Efu Koka is of Samoan and Niuean heritage and a proud son of Otara having been raised and educated at local schools Mayfield Primary, Bairds Intermediate and Hillary College.</p>
<p>He has been a member of the labour party for many years and brings both business experience and workers advocate skills as a former organiser with the Engineering Printing &amp; Manufacturing Union (EPMU).</p>
<p>His business experience includes a healthy portfolio in property investment, franchise licensee in NSW Australia and Europe for a Car Stacking System which has been marketed as a world leader in car parking infrastructure.</p>
<p>He is also a current alumni member of the Commonwealth Leaders Dialogue who was chosen from hundreds of applicants to participate in the Future Pacific Leaders Forum in 2006.</p>
<p>“I look forward to the challenge of continuing on the great work previous labour councillor &amp; deputy mayor Sua William Sio has done and I am deeply honoured for the privilege to represent labour in this by-election.”</p>
<p>“Having received the blessing of my family to pursue this political role, I want the community of Otara to know that I am committed to empowering all people to help themselves.”</p>
