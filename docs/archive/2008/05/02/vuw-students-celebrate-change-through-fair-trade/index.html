<p>Fair Trade Bazaar – VUW Students celebrate change through Fair Trade!</p>
<p>Victoria University’s Student Union Building will be buzzing with activity from 11am-3pm on Monday, May 5th with the Fair Trade Bazaar. The event will kick off Fair Trade Fortnight 2008.</p>
<p>The event is set to be packed with informative and interactive stalls, Fair Trade products and live world music. The bazaar will give students and the wider community an opportunity a chance to come try Fair Trade products, meet local Fair Trade businesses and see what Fair Trade is all about.</p>
<p>This event is being organised by members of Victoria University Club, Just Action.</p>
<p>“We want to showcase to students the difference that Fair Trade has made to over a million small farmers and producers around the world. With Fair Trade, students can buy a huge range of products such as shoes, t-shirts, chocolate, coffee, fruit and crafts and know that the producers received a fair price under good working conditions which promote community development.”</p>
<p>says Caleb Gordon, Co-leader of Just Action.</p>
<p>The Bazaar is also about celebrating Fair Trade, hence the live music, entertainment and dancing.”</p>
<p>says Just Action Secretary Sarah Wood.</p>
<p>The Bazaar will also feature stalls from Just Action, Greens@Vic, Victoria University environmental group Gecko, the Latin American Solidarity Committee and more, to give information and encourage debate on wider issues of International Trade Justice.
