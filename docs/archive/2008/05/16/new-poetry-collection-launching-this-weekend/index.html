<p>New Poetry Collection Launching This Weekend at Southland May Arts Month Festival</p>
<p>In Continents by Otago poet Richard Reeve will be launched during Invercargill’s May Arts Month Festival.</p>
<p>Poet Emma Neale, who is part of a large contingent of writers going to Invercargill for the Readers &amp; Writers Alive! programme, organised by the Dan Davin Literary Foundation and the Invercargill City Libraries, will do the honours. The launch will be held at the Invercargill Public Library, in the evening of 18 May, in conjunction with a Southern Writers panel.</p>
<p>In Continents, published by Auckland University Press, is critically acclaimed poet Reeve’s third collection of poems. The book draws in part on Reeve’s commitment to environmental preservation in New Zealand, which he also expresses through his work with the Upland Landscape Protection Society. Reeve is Chair of the Society, which has the core objective ‘to preserve and protect the environmental, ecological, visual and landscape values of the Uplands for present and future generations’.</p>
<p>The Readers and Writers Alive! Programme will include discussion and poetry readings by Cilla McQueen, Richard Reeve, Emma Neale, Kaye McKenzie Cook, David Howard, Jenny Powell-Chalmers and Alexandra- based Michael Harlow; a poetry writing; and an open mic.</p>
<p>The Writers and Readers Alive! bookseller will be H&amp;Js Take Note. The Dan Davin Literary Foundation is an Invercargill-based organisation that works to promote and support creative writing in Southland.</p>
