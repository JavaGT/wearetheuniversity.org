<p>Freemasons scholarship winner offers gift in return</p>
<p>Massey Wellington design student Leilani Isara turned the tables on Governor-General Anand Satyanand when she presented him with a Massey Association of Pasifika Students hoodie.</p>
<p>Ms Isara was one of five Massey students Mr Satyanand presented with scholarships from the New Zealand Freemasons at a reception in Wellington this week.</p>
<p>She designed the hoodie for the association while doing her fourth and final year of a Bachelor of Design in visual communication. Mr Satyanand was delighted with the gift. Although he initially wondered whether it would fit him, he later said would be &quot;excellent&quot; attire for walking the grounds of Government House.</p>
<p>Three other Massey undergraduate students also received Freemasons scholarships worth $6000 each: Courtenay Jacks, who is doing business studies at the Auckland campus, Hilary Corkran who is completing a Bachelor of Science honours at Palmerston North, and Adam O’Connell, who is studying for a Bachelor of Veterinary Science also at Palmerston North.</p>
<p>PhD candidate Kirsty Hammond received one of only seven $10,000 postgraduate scholarships. She is completing a PhD on the effects of fresh forage diets on methane production at Palmerston North.</p>
<p>The Freemasons awarded $238,000 worth of scholarships this year to 35 high-achieving students at New Zealand universities. The organisation is one of the largest privately-funded sponsors of students.</p>
<p>Grand Master Barry McLaggan says rewarding excellence in education is an investment in New Zealand&#39;s future. The programme was recently revamped to increase the value of the scholarships. “While applicants must be A-grade students completing their degrees, they must also take part in a non-academic community activity,” Mr McLagan says.</p>
<p>“Freemasons have helped young New Zealanders towards careers as varied as aerospace design, earthquake-proofing existing structures, assisting adolescent patients with eating disorders, and taxonomy research to improve biosecurity.&quot;</p>
<p>“Scholarship recipients are all high-achieving young people who recognise the importance of involvement in community service as well as academic success.&quot;</p>
