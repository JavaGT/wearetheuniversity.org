<p>MEDIA RELEASE<br>21 May 2008</p>
<p>How to decarbonise the global economy</p>
<p>Can the world economy continue to expand while at the same time significantly reduce carbon emissions per unit of production? If so, how can this best be achieved?</p>
<p>The challenge of reducing global carbon emissions, as well as the specific issues facing New Zealand, will be the focus of a highlevel lunchtime discussion with a distinguished panel of experts on World Environment Day (Thursday 5 June).</p>
<p>Professor Jonathan Boston, Director of the Institute of Policy Studies, says the event is an opportunity to hear the views of several world authorities on climate change policy, as well as local policy makers.</p>
<p>“Given the economic, social, political and environmental risks for New Zealand from unmitigated global warming, informed debate of this kind is essential for the New Zealand public, media and policymakers.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to be hosting a panel of such notable guests.&quot;</p>
<p>The event will run from12:15-1:<br>45pm at Lecture Theatre One, Rutherford House, 23 Lambton Quay, and is open to the public.</p>
<p>Hosted by Victoria University’s Institute of Policy Studies and the Climate Change Research Institute, this free event will be chaired by Radio New Zealand presenter Chris Laidlaw. Speakers include:</p>
<p>· Dr Rajendra Pachauri, Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</p>
<p>· Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme</p>
<p>· President Anote Tong of the Republic of Kiribati</p>

A business symposium comprising business leaders, researchers, senior public officials and the Prime Minister will be held on Wednesday 4 June, 9:15am12: 45pm in Auckland.</p>
