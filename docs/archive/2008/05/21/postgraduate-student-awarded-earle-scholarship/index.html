<p>Waikato University Postgraduate Student Awarded Earle Scholarship In Technology</p>
<p>Waikato University postgraduate student Lisa van den Berg is one of three recipients of a Dick and Mary Earle Scholarship in Technology for 2008; it was announced today by the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’ Committee (NZVCC). Managed by Public Trust, Lisa’s scholarship is worth $8,500. The other winners are Canterbury University postgraduate student William Kelton, and Massey University postgraduate student Alistair Scarfe.</p>
<p>Lisa, who was brought up in Maungaturoto, Northland and attended Otamatea High School, is currently completing her MSc at the University of Waikato. Lisa’s thesis investigates the bio-resins derived from waste proteins of the meat industry.</p>
<p>“I am very grateful to be the recipient of the Earle Scholarship in Technology. This will enable me to complete my master’s degree and increases my ability to achieve my goals. I want to help society by creating an alternative to petro-chemically derived plastic materials. Sustainability and the environment are of great importance to me and I am pleased to be studying towards the production and design of a renewable and biodegradable material,” Lisa said.</p>
<p>Dick and Mary Earle, who are both Emeritus Professors at Massey University, established the scholarship in 1999 to support and encourage postgraduate research into technology. The scholarship funds an individual to undertake research towards a masters or doctorate at a New Zealand university or other research institution, in one of two fields: innovation and product development, or bioprocess technology.</p>
<p>The scholarship was founded on the Earles’ belief that technology is important to the wellbeing and enhancement of the social fabric of the community. Dick and Mary Earle hope that through the scholarship, suitably qualified graduates will improve their own capacity to advance technology and contribute to technological knowledge relevant to New Zealand. Since 1999, 12 scholars have received funding through the scholarship to further their studies in technology.</p>
<p>Kiri Manuera, Scholarships Manager for the NZVCC says, “The NZVCC and Public Trust are pleased that this year’s Dick and Mary Earle Scholarship in Technology has been awarded to such an ambitious and outstanding student. Lisa van den Berg was chosen from a number of very impressive applicants. Lisa has very clear goals in mind and we wish her all the best for her studies, which will benefit us all long term.”</p>
<p>The Dick and Mary Earle Scholarship in Technology is one of over 40 scholarships awarded each year by the NZVCC. These include both graduate and undergraduate awards including the Claude McCarthy Fellowship, Commonwealth Scholarships, the Kitchener Memorial Scholarship, the Henry Kelsey Research Scholarship and the William Georgetti Scholarship.</p>
<p>This scholarship is also one of more than 400 charitable trusts (including a number of scholarships) managed by Public Trust. These trusts include interests as diverse as science, medicine, disability and agriculture. Collectively, the trusts and scholarships provide the means for many people to live better lives enhance their skills or enjoy better community facilities.</p>
<p>Lindsay Pope, Public Trust’s National Manager Charitable Services said, “Public Trust is very pleased that Lisa has been awarded this year’s scholarship. Her study supports the Earles’ vision to help improve the wellbeing of our society through technological research.”</p>
