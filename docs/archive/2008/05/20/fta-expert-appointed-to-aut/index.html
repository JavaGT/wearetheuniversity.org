<p>FTA expert appointed to AUT</p>
<p>Free Trade Agreement expert Dr Rahul Sen has been appointed as lecturer of business economics at the AUT Business School.</p>
<p>Dr Sen received a Doctor of Philosophy in Economics from the National University of Singapore and has an extensive research background in regional economic integration issues in the Asia-Pacific, particularly Free Trade Agreements (FTAs).</p>
<p>His expertise gained global recognition at the 2006 IMF-World Bank Annual Program of Seminars in Singapore which included his paper on FTAs and the Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) member countries.</p>
<p>Dr Sen has also been invited to present his views on Asian Trade policy at international forums organized by groups including the CESIfo Munich, SWP-Berlin, and Friedrich Ebert Stiftung.</p>
<p>Prior to joining AUT, Dr Sen was a Fellow with the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) from 2003-07 based in Singapore. At ISEAS, Dr Sen was responsible for co-editing the ASEAN Economic Bulletin journal and coordinating the activities of the institute&#39;s Trade Policy Unit.</p>
<p>At AUT, Dr Sen teaches International Trade Economics in the bachelor of business degree. He says he&#39;s looking forward to embracing AUT&#39;s teaching philosophy</p>
<p>&quot;The focus on staff-student interaction and student-centred learning in small classrooms is unusual but highly effective,&quot; he says. &quot;I have learnt very quickly that only the highest quality teaching and research is acceptable here.</p>
<p>&quot;This is challenging but very rewarding and I look forward to playing my part in this exciting environment.&quot;</p>

His research findings have been widely cited by researchers working on Asian economic integration. His recently published, peer-reviewed journal articles appeared in The World Economy and the Journal of World Trade.</p>
<p>Dr Sen is author of several books, book chapters and media articles.</p>
