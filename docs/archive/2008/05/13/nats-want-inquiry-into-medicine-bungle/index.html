<p>Tony Ryall MP National Party Health Spokesman</p>
<p>13 May 2008</p>
<p>Nats want inquiry into medicine bungle</p>
<p>National Party Health spokesman Tony Ryall is demanding a full investigation into why overseas visitors have been receiving subsidised medicines which they are not entitled to.</p>
<p>&quot;Millions of taxpayer dollars will have been wrongly paid to provide cheap medicines for overseas visitors because of a so-called computer glitch.</p>
<p>&quot;When many New Zealanders are asked to go without, this is a monumental blunder. The Government must explain how this has happened and what&#39;s being done to fix it.</p>
<p>&quot;Taxpayers will resent any suggestion that they have been subsidising medicines for visitors who are not entitled, when Kiwis face hurdle after hurdle to get the drugs they need.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ryall understands that the computer system used in about 85% of GP practices does not print out on the prescription form the code that identifies a patient as not being entitled to a subsidy.</p>
<p>The software fault means pharmacists filling prescriptions for visitors and some overseas students are charging them a subsidised rate.</p>
<p>Pharmacists then claim the subsidy from the Ministry of Health. The problem is also thought to have extended to lab tests.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders will be justifiably asking how Labour&#39;s army of health bureaucrats missed this serious problem and may have missed it for years. Who did the audits, why wasn&#39;t this picked up?&quot;</p>
<p>Last year around 2.5 million tourists visited New Zealand. Most are not entitled to subsidised health care.</p>
