<p>20 years of Mäori achievement at Massey University</p>
<p>Mäori student success, particularly at postgraduate level, has increased significantly in the 20 years that Massey University has been celebrating Mäori student achievement.</p>
<p>The 20th annual ceremony to honour Mäori graduates at the Palmerston North campus will be held in the Regent on Broadway Theatre on Friday 16 May.</p>
<p>“The fact that about half of this year&#39;s graduates have achieved postgraduate qualifications, including three graduating with doctorates in arts, business and science, is testament to the long-term investment Massey University has made to support and encourage Mäori professionals to continue with their study to a higher level,” says Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Mäori) Professor Mason Durie (pictured).</p>
<p>Just over 300 Mäori students from Massey’s three campuses, Auckland, Palmerston North and Wellington, will graduate this year. Of those, 68 students will take part in the ceremony at Palmerston North.</p>
<p>“The ceremony gives students the chance to acknowledge the contribution and support they have received from their whänau and friends to complete their degrees,” says Professor Durie, who is also acting Pro Vice-Chancellor of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences.</p>
<p>“Mäori representation across all disciplines and at all levels has grown significantly since the first ceremony in 1988, with a growing number of students studying business, sciences, and arts,” says Professor Durie.</p>
<p>“This year graduates have attained a range of qualifications in business, education, humanities, social sciences and sciences. There are also a significant number of graduates from the Mäori Visual Arts programme and the Te Rau Puawai, Mäori Mental Health Workforce Development programme.”</p>
