<p>Press Release: For Immediate Release</p>
<p>Save Women’s studies at Vic!<br>Wednesday, May 28, 2008</p>
<p>Victoria University Students’ Association Women’s Rights Officer, Georgina Dickson says, “We’re concerned that Gender and Women’s studies is under threat at a national level. It has disappeared from Massey, is withering away at Otago, Waikato and Auckland Universities.”</p>
<p>Dickson added, “The discipline of Gender and Women’s studies is an integral part of academia and should not be allowed to be undermined and lost.”</p>
<p>Film and Women’s Studies student, Freya Eng said, “This is my second major to be threatened in one month. I came from Sydney to study at Vic, and contribute to New Zealand society. It’s getting harder and harder to stay here.”</p>
<p>First year Gender and Women’s Studies student, Hera Bird said, “I gave up two years of full time work specifically to study Gender and Women’s studies at Vic. If that disappears I’ll have to go overseas.”</p>
<p>Politics and Gender studies student, Michael Haskell, “In theory I could study elsewhere but then I would lose access to resources that come with studying in Wellington.”</p>
