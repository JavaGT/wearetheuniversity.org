<p>Carbon Calculator Now Available to New Zealand Farmers</p>
<p>New Zealand farmers will be able to calculate and monitor their carbon footprints from today [May 29], following the launch of an industry-specific carbon calculator.</p>
<p>The free web-based calculator, designed by Lincoln University’s Agribusiness and Economics Research Unit (AERU) and engineering consultancy AgriLINK, is the first monitoring tool of its kind made specifically for farmers. It uses software developed by Lincoln University’s Applied Computing Group.</p>
<p>The calculator determines emissions from livestock, farm energy use, and the use of fertiliser and feed, to arrive at totals for methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions. These are then converted and expressed as total CO2 equivalents. The calculation requires farmers to enter basic data such as farm size, livestock numbers, fertiliser application, fuel usage and their contractors’ activities.</p>
<p>Professor Caroline Saunders, AERU’s Director, says the calculator fills a major gap in the range of management tools available for the typical New Zealand farming operation. It was built as an extension to AERU and AgriLINK’s research into the “food miles” associated with exporting primary produce to Europe. This ground breaking research in 2006 showed that, even when transport between markets is included, New Zealand producers are more energy efficient than their European counterparts across a range of primary product categories.</p>

<p>“There has been considerable discussion among industry groups about the need for a specific carbon calculator for farmers, but to our knowledge none have made it into the public domain,” says Professor Saunders.</p>
<p>“This is a tool which, for the first time, allows farmers on a range of properties to easily calculate their farm’s CO2 footprint, to set a benchmark, and to set targets which they can monitor from year to year.”</p>
<p>The completion of the calculator was a voluntary project for AERU and AgriLINK researchers. The web address is <a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/carboncalculator/">http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/carboncalculator/</a>. There are also links from the AERU and AgriLINK web sites.</p>
