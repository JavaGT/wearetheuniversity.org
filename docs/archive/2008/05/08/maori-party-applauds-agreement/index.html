<p>Maori Party applauds agreement between iwi and university</p>
<p>Tariana Turia, MP for Te Tai Hauauru 7 May 2008</p>
<p>A formal Memorandum of Understanding between Ngati Toa, based in Porirua, and the University of Otago is a great way for academia to acknowledge tangata whenua in a relationship modelled on the Treaty of Waitangi, said local MP Tariana Turia.</p>
<p>The six-year MOU was signed this week at Takapuwahia marae in Porirua.</p>
<p>“An agreement like this establishes a kaupapa on which a relationship can evolve. It is a statement of good faith, and commitment to a future together,” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“This is a much more constructive approach than we have seen in other parts of this rohe.</p>
<p>“Today, the Maori Party visited Palmerston North, only to hear that the Manfeild Park Board in Feilding has ignored Ngati Kauwhata’s protests over the board’s invalid title, and sold part of their land for private development.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow we visit Levin and the Kapiti Coast, where the District Council is meeting at 8.00am to decide whether to finally approve a similar development of Paraparaumu Airport land, despite active public protests that part of the land should have been offered back to Maori and non-Maori former landowners.</p>
<p>“We are also looking forward to visiting Takapuwahia, where the tangata whenua and a major institution can celebrate their shared history and relationships.</p>
<p>“The University’s Wellington School of Medicine and Health Sciences houses the Eru Pomare Research Centre, which has a special focus on Maori health. The late Eru Pomare was a distinguished son of Ngati Toa, whose whänau maintains a strong presence in local affairs. We may get to hear a bit more about that tomorrow evening,” said Mrs Turia.</p>
