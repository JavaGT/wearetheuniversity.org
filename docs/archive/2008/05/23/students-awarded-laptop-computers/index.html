<p>Students Awarded Laptop Computers</p>
<p>Seventy post-graduate students at AUT University have been awarded Lenovo laptop computers through a new scholarship programme.</p>
<p>The recipients, all of whom are studying at Masters and PhD level, will receive their new Lenovo ThinkPad notebook computers from Lenovo at a ceremony at AUT University on Saturday 24th May.</p>
<p>AUT is the first Lenovo &#39;ThinkPad University&#39; in New Zealand, one of just two such institutions in the Asia Pacific region. Students were awarded the scholarships by AUT on the basis of excellent academic achievement and ongoing commitment to attaining a post-graduate qualification.</p>
<p>PhD candidate Doug King, who is researching the incidence of injuries in rugby league, says having a laptop will free him from the desktop. King, who works as a registered nurse in a hospital emergency department and has three children to support, says the decision to undertake postgraduate study at the PhD level was not an easy one to make, for financial reasons and commitments of time.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been locked away on the desktop computer in the evenings so that I can transcribe the data I have gathered during the day onto spreadsheets for my research.</p>
<p>&quot;The ThinkPad scholarship adds a new dimension to my studies and enables me to have access to my data gathering in the field and frees up some time for my family and other commitments.&quot;</p>
<p>Jashim Khan, of Ellerslie, who is doing a PhD to ascertain whether electronic payment systems impact purchase behaviour says the scholarship came at just the right time to help with data collection.</p>

<p>&quot;This scholarship will significantly add value to my research in terms of electronic coding of raw data and analysis. It will also save lots of time in other areas of research and enhance the quality of my research outputs.&quot;</p>
<p>Liz Gosling, AUT Director of IT Services says, &quot;AUT recognises the academic and financial pressure faced by students, and looks forward to lightening the load for high-achieving post-graduate students.&quot;</p>
<p>Lenovo account executive, Adam Platt says, &quot;Lenovo ThinkPads are an essential productivity tool for today&#39;s business and research environments. The partnership with AUT through the ThinkPad University programme is another successful example of Lenovo helping New Zealand schools and universities develop the highly skilled workforce necessary for a competitive economy.&quot;</p>
