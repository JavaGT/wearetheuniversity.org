<p>Friday 23 May 2008<br>University announces Professor of Accountancy</p>
<p>Leading researcher Roger Willett has been appointed as a Professor of Accountancy, in the School of Business.</p>
<p>Professor Willett has returned to the University’s Department of Accountancy and Business Law after 10 years overseas.</p>
<p>Dean of the School of Business Professor George Benwell said Professor Willett brings many strengths as both a teacher and a researcher.</p>
<p>“Appointing Professor Willett, an established and leading researcher, brings great potential to strengthen integrated business research within the School and across the University in general. By promoting applied research widely, we can extend the work into the business community.</p>
<p>“Accountancy is a key business discipline and having Professor Willett join our team of researchers and teachers positively strengthens the School’s resources and capabilities,” he said.</p>
<p>One of Professor Willett’s immediate goals is for the Department of Accountancy &amp; Business Law to develop a multi-disciplinary profile in applied research in engineering asset management, through collaboration with international research centres.</p>
<p>Professor Willett’s teaching areas include financial accounting, financial accounting theory and research methods. He is also on editorial boards for a number of academic journals, and is also a past New Zealand president of the Accounting and Finance Association of Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>In announcing the appointment, University of Otago Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg said that he was delighted that the University had appointed someone of Professor Willett’s calibre to the post.</p>

<p>“Professor Willett’s return to our shores from Australia demonstrates his confidence in New Zealand’s most research intensive University. We welcome him back and look forward to his continued contribution to the Accountancy and Business Law Department, the School of Business and the wider University,” said Professor Skegg.</p>
<p>Professor Willett was previously Professor in the Faculty of Business, Queensland University of Technology (1997 -2006), Head of Department (1996-7) and Research Professor (1992-5) at the University of Otago, New Zealand. Prior to that he held posts at the Australian National University (1990-2) and in UK institutions (the Universities of Wales and Aberdeen).</p>
<p>He is also a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, and has published articles and books on statistical aspects of accounting measurement, international accounting, management accounting, auditing and other aspects of accounting. Professor Willett is currently working on a number of assignments relating to issues in asset return and risk measurement.</p>
