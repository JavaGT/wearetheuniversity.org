<p>Research projects to investigate public transport use</p>
<p>Two significant research contracts funded by the New Zealand Transport Agency’s 2008-09 research programme have been awarded to staff in Massey&#39;s School for People, Environment and Planning.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Christine Cheyne and Dr Imran Muhammad, of the school&#39;s resource and environmental planning programme, are each leading a project.</p>
<p>Dr Cheyne will gather data on transport implications of population shifts in non-metropolitan regions, including a survey and interviews with residents in those regions about their use or non-use of public transport.</p>
<p>&quot;This research seeks to fill a gap in research about public transport attitudes and behaviour&quot;, she says &quot;Existing research has been conducted mainly in metropolitan areas or large urban centres.”</p>
<p>With environmental and economic factors now influencing a shift away from private transport, there<br>are some challenges for parts of New Zealand that have smaller populations, Dr Cheyne says.</p>
<p>“They cannot support conventional mass volume public transport. But there is a lot of scope for shared transport or what is known as demand responsive transport. Our research will focus on the potential for expansion of such options.&quot;</p>
<p>The second project, led by Dr Muhammed, will prepare a best-practice guide for public transport planning in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.</p>
<p>&quot;The strength of this project lies in its international research team and this project will draw directly on expertise from Australian and northern European universities,&quot; says Dr Muhammad.</p>

<p>&quot;This research project will investigate ways to maximise public transport performance – through improved network planning with limited resources – in the specific conditions found in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.&quot;</p>
