<h3></h3>
<p>A CONSPIRACY OF CONSPIRACIES</p>
<p>Today I am going to talk about conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>A political conspiracy is a secret plan to carry out an illegal or harmful act with political motivations.</p>
<p>Does this sound familiar?</p>
<p>It should because that is what has been happening in New Zealand in the months leading up to the election.</p>
<p>There are some groups of people who believe that they, and only they, should be deciding who should control New Zealand for the next three years.</p>
<p>These people represent powerful, faceless, wealthy interests based both here and overseas.</p>
<p>They have been trying to grab control of this country since 1984 and they are getting more desperate as each election goes by.</p>
<p>Their agenda has never changed.</p>
<p>It is a plan to sell assets at bargain basement prices, to slash wages and benefits, including New Zealand Superannuation.</p>
<p>Everyone in this room should remember with horror the years of Rogernomics and Ruthenasia.</p>
<p>New Zealand was brought to its knees by imported ideological madness.</p>
<p>We are still trying to recover from it, yet there are certain interests who yearn to go back to those bad old days.</p>
<p>There are still some rich pickings for them.</p>
<p>They want the remaining taxpayer owned assets that have not yet been flogged off.</p>
<p>New Zealand First stands in their way.</p>

<p>And they are doing everything possible to get rid of us, including the dirtiest smear campaign in the history of New Zealand politics.</p>
<p>The people of Northland know what it is like to be betrayed by people in Wellington.</p>
<p>This province has a proud heritage. We know about this because the Peters’ come from up around here.</p>
<p>Nowhere has the proud heritage of this great province been shown better than on the rugby fields.</p>
<p>Some of the great names in New Zealand rugby are still household names up here.</p>
<p>Names like the Going brothers, Peter Jones, Ian Jones, JB Smith, Fred and Kawhena Woodman. Joe Morgan, Dickson Wright, Muru Walters.</p>
<p>Fresh from the World Cup debacle, the New Zealand Rugby Union has decided to kick Northland out of the National Provincial Championship.</p>
<p>Grassroots rugby in the North deserves a better deal and we are pleased to see that Northland is refusing to give in without a fight.</p>
<p>The suits in Wellington need to realise that rugby is a game owned by the players and the supporters.</p>
<p>Great rugby provinces like Northland should not be sacrificed on the grounds of expediency.</p>
<p>We urge the New Zealand Rugby Union to think again and to remember the thousands of people who built the game in the North.</p>
<p>We have always been an independent breed up here.</p>
<p>If you look at our history, you will see that conforming has never been our idea of fun.</p>
<p>Right from the start of our pre-European history, Nga Puhi had their own way of doing things.</p>
<p>And when they decided they disagreed with the way the British colonised the place, the boys did not let the odd flagpole stand in the way.</p>
<p>There’s an old story up here about the way we react to things in Northland.</p>
<p>We always unite to fight a common outside foe and if we run out of foes we turn the guns on one another!</p>
<p>This time there is a common enemy and we must stay united if we are to win this latest battle.</p>
<p>It is over the ownership of New Zealand and the control of our resources.</p>
<p>Do not think for one minute that your life will be better after the next election if New Zealand First is not around.</p>
<p>We have this simple belief that it is our duty to protect the vulnerable in our society.</p>
<p>And that includes a pledge to treat senior citizens with respect and to allow them to live out their well deserved retirement with enough income for their needs.</p>
<p>Food, shelter, warmth and healthcare are basic rights for the elderly.</p>
<p>You have made your contribution. It is up to us to recognise it.</p>
<p>You should not be paupers relying on charity in this country you helped to build.</p>
<p>Here are some of our plans for after the next election.</p>
<p>Our philosophy is that superannuation, retirement, healthcare and daily living is a total package that you have earned.</p>
<p>This is what we will do:</p>
<p> Increase New Zealand Superannuation to 68 percent of the net average wage.</p>
<p> Subsidise your power bills</p>
<p> Extend the buying power of the SuperGold Card</p>
<p> Make your communities safer</p>
<p> Protect your savings and investments</p>
<p>At present you are always playing catch-up with superannuation.</p>
<p>We are slowly but surely pushing up the rate.</p>
<p>After the next election it will go from 66 percent of the net average wage to 68 percent.</p>
<p>We worry about your soaring power bills.</p>
<p>We do not want senior citizens worrying about turning a heater on during the cold dark nights of winter.</p>
<p>We will subsidise power bills at the rate of $100 a month for three months in winter.</p>
<p>There is a lot of nonsense talked about the SuperGold Card.</p>
<p>We remind you that we had to start somewhere and already it is more successful than some Australian states where it has been available now for more than fifteen years.</p>
<p>Remember, ours has been in operation for less than one year.</p>
<p>The first shipment of updated SuperGold Card directories – which contain over 850 businesses and nearly 5000 business outlets were delivered this month.</p>
<p>Hundreds of new businesses have joined since the card was launched.</p>
<p>So use your new directory and the true benefits of the SuperGold Card will become even clearer.</p>
<p>When the free off-peak public transport kicks in later this year, along with the extra $500 subsidy for hearing aids it will be even more valuable.</p>
<p>We have also delivered on our pledge to recruit an extra thousand police.</p>
<p>You have the right to feel safe in your homes and on the streets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are law and order problems in just about every town or city in New Zealand.</p>
<p>We intend to put local gangs out of business and to clamp down on crime.</p>
<p>You’ll hear more about this later but we have a policy of banning gangs and all the crime that comes with them.</p>
<p>The legislation is drafted and ready to go. Gang members will be given a choice of going straight or staying in gaol until they are too old to cause any more problems.</p>
<p>Perhaps, in the fullness of time they could set up a branch of GreyPower in Paremoremo.</p>
<p>(Just joking of course)</p>
<p>There is another area in which some extra protection is needed.</p>
<p>Investment and savings.</p>
<p>The present situation is a shambles.</p>
<p>Over the past few months thousands of people have lost billions of dollars through finance and property company collapses and repayment moratoriums.</p>
<p>Many of those affected have been the elderly. Some have lost everything.</p>
<p>They are being penalised for being prudent and setting something aside for their retirement.</p>
<p>These finance cowboys have to be made accountable.</p>
<p>We in New Zealand First are also looking at a system within the banking industry to guarantee deposits up to $100,000.</p>
<p>They would have to be New Zealand-owned institutions and operate under strict guidelines.</p>
<p>Kiwibank and TSB are two such institutions we would look at.</p>
<p>The point is that we are a savings poor country.</p>
<p>We have relied too much on the savings of other countries.</p>
<p>It has to be more attractive for people to invest in their own country and to know that their investments are protected.</p>
<p>We are not talking about speculation. We are talking about savings and investing those savings in the growth and development of this country.</p>
<p>We must have faith in ourselves and go back to being nation builders.</p>
<p>The days of the wreckers are over.</p>
<p>New Zealand First is standing firmly in their way. We will not let them reduce your benefits or sell your assets ever again.</p>
<p>In a few weeks, as tax cuts take effect for working New Zealanders, those on superannuation will get a major windfall.</p>
<p>For married couples this means just under $23 a week, with adjusted amounts for other rates of New Zealand Superannuation.</p>
<p>We said your superannuation needed to be higher – and it is.</p>
<p>But our commitment does not stop there.</p>
<p>This coming election is about the really basic issues.</p>
<p>It&#39;s about the survival of ordinary people in the face of oil price shocks, exorbitant interest rates, price rises, increased crime and threatened unemployment.</p>
<p>You hold the future of this country in your hands.</p>
<p>Do not be fooled by what politicians say – look at the record and look what politicians actually DO.</p>
<p>Words are cheap. Promises are cheap.</p>
<p>Look at the record of New Zealand First.</p>
<p>Look at our record of protecting senior citizens.</p>
<p>Look at our record of providing free medical care for the young.</p>
<p>We need more troops in Parliament to fight on behalf of you and your families.</p>
<p>Give us and the numbers and we will not let you down.</p>
