<p>PRESS RELEASE: NEW ZEALAND LAW STUDENTS’ ASSOCIATION INC</p>
<p>Law Students Prepare For Annual Conference</p>
<p>11 August 2008</p>
<p>More than sixty of New Zealand’s top law students will converge on Auckland over the first week of September for the New Zealand Law Students’ Association’s (NZLSA) annual conference.</p>
<p>Held over five days, from the second to the seventh of September, the Conference will incorporate the finals of the four law student competitions: Mooting, Negotiation, Client Interviewing and Witness Examination. “Law competitions are an excellent opportunity for New Zealand’s law students to gain skills essential to legal practice” NZLSA President Dave Dewar said. This year the standard has been very high, with Wellington mooters making the Australasian final at Hobart in July.</p>
<p>The Conference will be opened with a dinner at Auckland University’s Fale Pasifika, and will end with a closing dinner at which the Governor General, the Honourable Anand Satyanand will be the guest speaker.</p>
<p>An inaugural education forum will be held on 4th September at the Auckland Business School, where the keynote speaker will be Marie Dyhrberg.</p>
<p>“In addition to having a great time at a number of social events, delegates will be discuss a number of matters of importance to New Zealand’s law students, including the future of the LLB, legal professionals courses and the proposal by AUT for a sixth law school,” Dewar said.</p>
<p>National law firm Simpson Grierson has been named as the Gold Sponsor for the 2008 Conference and Anderson Lloyd is the Silver sponsor. “We are stoked to have Simpson Grierson and Anderson Lloyd on board for the Conference” said Dewar. “New Zealand Law Students are incredibly well supported by the legal profession – particularly our competitions sponsors: Bell Gully; Buddle Findlay; Russell McVeagh and Minter Ellison Rudd Watts – representatives of which will judge the competition finals and present the winners’ trophies at the final dinner.”</p>
<p>The NZLSA represents the interests of New Zealand’s more than four thousand law students.</p>
