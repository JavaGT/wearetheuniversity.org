<p>Winston Peters - That “Vision” Thing</p>
<p>To start my speech tonight I thought I would quote a line from a song from the once highly popular television series called MASH.</p>
<p>You probably watch the back episodes now and then. There was a song attached to MASH and while I don’t agree with the chorus – I like some of the verses.</p>
<p>This was one of them:</p>
<p>“A brave man once requested me,<br>to answer questions that are key,</p>
<p>Is it to be or not be be</p>
<p>And I replied oh why ask me.”</p>
<p>So I have been thinking. Why ask me to give you some vision for the future?<br>This is a heavy responsibility on my shoulders.</p>
<p>What can I tell you? What do you expect? What if I put you wrong and you leave this building with ruined lives?</p>
<p>What if you leave intent on a life of crime and decadence?</p>
<p>I could never forgive myself.</p>
<p>Looking for an answer, as you do in these times, we turned to the Internet and found an advice service for young people – in Britain.<br>Let me quote from it:</p>
<p>“The service aims to provide integrated advice, guidance and access to personal development opportunities and to help young people make a smooth transition to adulthood and working life.</p>
<p>You can talk to a Personal Adviser (PA) about anything you need to; career ideas, education, higher education, housing problems, self confidence, teenage pregnancy, young parenthood, bullying, alcohol problems, drugs issues, problems at home, or whatever is on your mind.”</p>

<p>Well tonight we are not going to talk about any of those topics, compelling and interesting as they might be.</p>
<p>We are going to talk about some of the things that confront you on a daily basis because the big picture of our lives is painted by how we tackle each day.<br>Someone once said life is not about the goals we seek – it is about our journey through it.</p>
<p>One of the most important discoveries I have made personally is that we live in an ocean of useless information, and every few minutes someone tips another bucket of it over us.</p>
<p>Never before in human history has so much information been inflicted on the so-called civilised societies on this planet.</p>
<p>Huge industries have been built on a perceived demand for this information.</p>
<p>You could sit at a computer 24 hours a day seven days a week, being drip fed and attached to certain other apparatus and you would still receive only a tiny fraction of the information available.</p>
<p>The Internet is a wonderful thing. It has allowed the creation of that phenomenon known as “blogging”.</p>
<p>In Wellington teams of people spend their spare time filling cyberspace with their opinions.</p>
<p>Now we can’t be too critical because we have set up an election blog site called <a href="http://www.winstonpeters.com">www.winstonpeters.com</a> – and there is no doubt some useful social function is being served.</p>
<p>But it really is like some kind of version of talkback radio. They would probably benefit more from going to cooking classes!</p>
<p>Even the newspapers have their blog sites and their opinion sites.<br>It&#39;s getting hard to take them seriously these days because half the journalists are bloggers and many of the bloggers are journalists.</p>
<p>So let me give one a piece of advice that has served me well for a long time now – never believe what you see in the media.</p>
<p>Most of these people have an aversion to the truth unless it fits their agenda.</p>
<p>It is sad really, because so many people rely on them for information.</p>
<p>Most media a trying to play a game of join the dots but without any dots, and they wonder why they get the picture all wrong.</p>
<p>You see we in New Zealand have a recycled merry go round when it comes to those in the media.</p>
<p>Look at your Sunday newspapers – all the commentators are failed TVNZ managers, political aspirants or journalists who had been moved on from other organisations.</p>
<p>This is why you can never take them seriously.</p>
<p>So, if there was any advice to give on the topic of the media, believe a fraction of what you read and even less of what you hear!<br>Computers, television and the education system all seem to be gradually eradicating the ancient art of reading books.<br>Hands up those who have read a novel for enjoyment this year!</p>
<p>Various educational institutions are churning out students who do not read books.</p>
<p>This is a tragedy.</p>
<p>Generations of New Zealanders have educated themselves simply by reading books.<br>Thousands of them.</p>
<p>Some of our greatest political leaders had little formal education but they were voracious readers.</p>
<p>The walls of their houses were lined with books.<br>Books about everything.</p>
<p>Most of all books about ideas.</p>
<p>Do you know that it is now possible to leave university with an arts and a law degree without ever having read a Charles Dickens novel?</p>
<p>This is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>But perhaps a sign of the times.</p>
<p>Another topic I wanted to raise with you this evening is about your grandparents.</p>
<p>Yesterday I took part in a GreyPower retirement forum in Porirua just north of Wellington.</p>
<p>The age of the audience ranged from the sixties through to the late eighties.<br>That generation of people, and the one before them, built one of the best societies on earth.</p>
<p>We were ranked second in the list of developed countries.</p>
<p>We were regarded as some kind of social laboratory with our healthcare, education and social services.</p>
<p>We really cared about the common welfare of our citizens.</p>
<p>The senior citizens attending the forum yesterday entered a social contract with the governments of their time.</p>
<p>They worked hard, paid high taxes, raised their families and contributed to their communities.</p>
<p>In return the state agreed to help look after them when they grew old, sick or infirm.</p>
<p>In your lifetimes this contract was broken. Not by the people but by the governments they elected to defend them.</p>
<p>You are young and strong. You have your lives ahead of you.</p>
<p>Your grandparents are slowing down. They have made their contribution.<br>It is coming up to your turn.</p>
<p>Young people are idealists – and that is good. What better vision than to make New Zealand a great society again?</p>
<p>Why not follow in the footsteps of your grandparents and their parents who built this country?</p>
<p>Just spend a few minutes talking to your grandparents whenever you can.<br>In most of the world’s ancient societies the elderly are held in high esteem because of their wisdom.</p>
<p>Unfortunately in some other countries they are regarded as a social expense and a burden on the health system.</p>
<p>You have an obligation, each and every one of you, to ensure that your grandparents are treated with dignity in retirement.</p>
<p>They are entitled to an adequate pension, healthcare and a decent standard of living.</p>
<p>We in New Zealand First have always believed in looking after the most vulnerable in our society - the young and the elderly.<br>That is why we introduced free healthcare for the under sixes back in 1996 and have continually fought for a better deal for the elderly.<br>We recognise also the importance of education. We regard it as an investment, not an expense.</p>
<p>Education is the key to our future as a small country at the bottom of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It has always been our policy to introduce a universal student allowance. We are concerned about the mounting levels of student debt.</p>
<p>For some years we have advocated a “bonding” system under which selected students in areas such as medicine would get their fees abated in return for working in certain areas for a fixed term.</p>
<p>This is not new to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Many people gained university qualifications last century through their employers, mainly government departments.</p>
<p>They worked during the holidays and attended university during the terms.<br>In return, they signed a contract to stay with that department for a fixed number of years.</p>
<p>This system could be used again. All it requires is the will to do it.<br>As I started with a quote I would like to end with one. That great American philosopher Homer J Simpson said this about life:</p>
<p>“Your lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or I, many of them incompetent boobs. I know this because I worked alongside them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions time and again. And I say ....This stinks!”</p>
<p>So if I were to give any advice for the future to you, these would be my suggestions.</p>
<p>1. Grab each day as it comes along and enjoy it. You never know when it could be your last.<br>2. Always read books – any books but especially novels.<br>3. Go fishing whenever you can. Apparently God does not deduct fishing time from our lives.<br>4. Be loyal to your friends.<br>5. Keep laughing.<br>6. Don&#39;t keep filling your heads with useless information.<br>7. Don&#39;t eat too many carbohydrates.<br>8. And save your Grandma – vote New Zealand First.<br>Thank you – and good luck.</p>
