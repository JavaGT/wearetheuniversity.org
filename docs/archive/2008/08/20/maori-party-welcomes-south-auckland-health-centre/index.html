<p>Maori Party Welcomes South Auckland Health Centre</p>
<p>Hon Tariana Turia and Dr Pita Sharples; Co-leaders of the Maori Party</p>
<p>Tuesday 19 August 2008</p>
<p>Maori Party Co-leaders, Dr Pita Sharples and Hon Tariana Turia, congratulated Counties Manukau DHB, Auckland University, Manukau Institute of Technology and AUT University for their brave step forward in announcing earlier today a new health research centre for up to 500 trainee health workers to be built in South Auckland.</p>
<p>“This is huge for us in Tamaki Makaurau” said Dr Sharples. “We have an incredibly diverse and vibrant community in South Auckland – home to more than 150 different ethnic groups – and so ‘one size fits all’ has never applied”.</p>
<p>“The Maori Party absolutely endorses the intention of the centre to attract more local people into health training and by doing so, to create a health workforce that more closely reflects our communities”.</p>
<p>“It is a boost for Tamaki Makaurau – the collaboration of key players in our educational institutions is going to lift the levels of tertiary education and participation in a way which will have real spin-offs for the community”.</p>
<p>“The other exciting thing about today” said Tariana Turia, health spokesperson for the Maori Party, “is that I understand particular emphasis will be placed on increasing the number of health workers who are Maori, Pasifika or Asian”.</p>
<p>“Such an emphasis is well overdue” such Mrs Turia. “In 2004, only 2.6% of all active medical practitioners were Maori (234)”.</p>

<p>“The 2005 statistics weren’t much better –Maori made up 7% of all working nurses (2729) and midwives (110) and just 2.1% of all dentists (35)” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“These numbers are abysmally low – and it gets even worse – in 2006, Aotearoa had only four Maori chiropractors and eleven Maori dieticians – and believe it or not – this represented a huge increase on the 2005 numbers!”.</p>
<p>“We need capable and culturally competent health workers who are equipped to provide quality healthcare to our whanau – and we need it today” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“There has been a huge demand to create a health workforce which represents the face of our future” said Mrs Turia. “We congratulate everyone involved in establishing the new health centre, and I am sure we will all be eagerly awaiting results!”.</p>
