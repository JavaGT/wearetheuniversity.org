<p>Spark alumni start-ups shine in entrepreneurship awards</p>
<p>Alumni start-ups from The University of Auckland Business School’s annual entrepreneurship challenge, Spark, won a number of awards on Tuesday evening at the Gen-i New Zealand Incubators Awards in Wellington.</p>
<p>The awards highlighted the growth of New Zealand’s incubation industry, with the winning companies representing everything from robotics and GPS tracking, through to wireless power solutions and mobile banking.</p>
<p>This year’s winners from among Spark alumni are as follows<br>Start-up of the Year: INRO Technologies Ltd<br>Innovation of the Year: PowerbyProxi Ltd.</p>
<p>Both start-ups are resident within well-known Auckland incubator and Spark foundation partner, The ICEHOUSE. The University of Auckland Business School is a founding partner of The ICEHOUSE.</p>
<p>Three other start-ups from The ICEHOUSE won the following awards:<br>Start-up Entrepreneur of the Year: eBUS’s Carmine Masiello<br>Hall of Fame Award: Joint winners Mobile Mentor and M-Com.</p>
<p>At the awards, Gen-i Australasia CEO Chris Quin said: “The range of exciting companies showcased demonstrates the pivotal role of incubators in providing the right environment for start-ups to succeed.”</p>
<p>In presenting the awards, Minister for Economic Development Pete Hodgson said:<br>“Business incubation can help diversify economies, commercialise technologies, create jobs and build wealth. I’m therefore confident that the businesses represented at these awards can provide New Zealand with a source of innovative, high growth companies for the future.”</p>

<p>Separate from the awards, other Spark alumni are also making valuable contributions to New Zealand&#39;s start-up triumphs. These include NEXX and Anomymouse.</p>
<p>NEXX, a group of University of Auckland students who won the 2007 Spark $40K Challenge with an idea which was basically &quot;an eBay for Loans&quot;. Twelve months later, they have just closed their first Angel fundraising round (through the ICEANGELS) for a significant amount.</p>
<p>Anonymouse, a confidential job-seeking service, was the Spark Challenge winner in 2006. Two years on, it has just been bought out by QJumpers.</p>
<p>Spark is proud to have supported all of these teams, as they illustrate how University of Auckland staff and students can start their own company using the excellent entrepreneurial eco-system infrastructure within the University. Opportunities still exist to get involved with Spark for 2008 and over $20,000 of prizes are still available. See the website below for more information.</p>
