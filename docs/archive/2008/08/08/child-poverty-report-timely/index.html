<p>CTU MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>07 August 2008</p>
<p>Child Poverty Report Timely</p>
<p>&quot;Elimination of child poverty is an absolute priority and the Council of Trade Unions commend the leadership shown by the Children&#39;s Commissioner and Barnardos in identifying the actions needed to address child poverty,&quot; CTU spokesperson Sharon Clair said, following a new report from the two groups.</p>
<p>&quot;Far too many New Zealand workers are on low wages. This has a direct impact on thousands of poor families, and contributes to our unacceptable rates of child poverty. Unions will continue our campaign for a $15 minimum wage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is positive to see from the report that Working for Families has had a significant impact and benefited low-income people and working people. Also, 20 hours free early childhood care, lower cost doctors visits and prescriptions and free childhood medical care, paid parental leave and regular minimum wage increases provide the base for further changes in child poverty rates, as has already been shown.&quot;</p>
<p>Whilst progress has been made by this government and that has benefited low-income people and working people there is still a lot more to be done said CTU spokesperson, Sharon Clair. Unions share concerns of the report&#39;s authors, and the recent CPAG report, about income reductions that some people experience when losing work, and that questions still need to be addressed in regard to poverty in beneficiary families.</p>
