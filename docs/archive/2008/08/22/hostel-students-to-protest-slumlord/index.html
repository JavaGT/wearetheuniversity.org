<p>Hostel Students to Protest “Slumlord”</p>
<p>Thursday, 21st August</p>
<p>Press Release: Victoria University Students Association</p>
<p>PRESS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>300 students’ are protesting against Unicomm Hostel owners ING Group tomorrow, after having a year from Hell.</p>
<p>Victoria University Students’ Association President, Joel Cosgrove says, “515 residents aged between 18 and 21 have been plagued by issues including leaking sewage, and are receiving a miserable response from management.”</p>
<p>Cosgrove added, “These young people have been taken advantage of by ING Group, who posted a NZD$16 Billion profit last year, and are forcing them into slum like conditions. Frankly, I am pissed that it could sink this low. Students have tried to resolve these issues are just sick of it!”</p>
<p>Unicomm Resident, Kirstin MacKay, 18 said, &quot;I woke up to see my skylight missing and a builder staring at me through my roof, I was extremely uncomfortable so went and slept on the couch.&quot;</p>
<p>Another Unicomm Resident, Ellen, 18 stated, &quot;Try f***ing waking up at 6:30 in the morning to a crane outside your window when you have an exam that morning!!!&quot;</p>
<p>3rd floor resident, Josh McArthur, 18 said, “I’ve spent $10,000 to be in a hostel close to Uni, and that hasn’t helped one bit. The never ending construction has disrupted everything – I wish I hadn’t come here. I am going home to get away from this mess.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got a bunch of people who’ve moved out of home for the first time. They’ve had a horrible entry into independent life and part of that experience has been at the uncaring hands of ING,” says Cosgrove.</p>
<p>“As opposed to dealing with the issue and entering into a dialogue with students, Unicomm are cancelling their open day and cancelling their information stall on campus so that students can’t disrupt it,” says Cosgrove.</p>
<p>“When they say that the buildings are closed for renovations, they don’t mention that students are still being forced to live there with no compensation.”</p>
