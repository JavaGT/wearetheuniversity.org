<p>Media Release</p>
<p>An address by Rt Hon Winston Peters to Rodney GreyPower,<br>Mahurangi Community Centre,<br>Humatana Road, Snells Beach, Northland,<br>Friday 29th August 2008, 11 am</p>
<p>Keeping The Wolf From The Door</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen you might have noticed that we are only a few months from an election.<br>A pivotal moment for our nation approaches because an election is a time to reflect upon and chose a direction for New Zealand.</p>
<p>What New Zealanders want to know – in fact what they are entitled to know – is precisely what the political parties are offering.</p>
<p>Because you do not need a crystal ball to see some economic storm clouds on the horizon.</p>
<p>Whoever leads the government in the next Parliament will face tough conditions.<br>The global economy is on a knife edge.<br>The United States sub-prime mortgage meltdown is generally regarded as starting in August 2007 but the end of the financial upheavals is not yet in sight.</p>
<p>Central banks are still trying to bring stability to global financial markets.</p>
<p>So there is a real possibility of major international financial disruption and as far as New Zealand’s domestic economy is concerned, Treasury has told us we are in recession already.</p>
<p>Unlike other political parties, New Zealand First is convinced that New Zealand should be bracing itself to face real economic challenges.</p>
<p>This is not the time to be talking about huge tax cuts or big road tolls.</p>
<p>It is not time to talk about big borrowing programmes.</p>

<p>We must put the days of borrow, boom and bust behind us.</p>
<p>Your generation and your parents have lived through both the bad times and the good times in New Zealand.</p>
<p>We have surely reached the stage where we can use the good times to smooth out the bad.</p>
<p>And at the same time we must ensure that we protect the vulnerable groups in our community.</p>
<p>A civilised society is measured by the way it treats its senior citizens.</p>
<p>In many countries the elderly are respected and held in high esteem because of the wisdom of their years and the contribution they have made.</p>
<p>In some others the elderly are seen as a problem – a cost on the health system and their pensions a drain on the economy.</p>
<p>No party cares more about the elderly than us.</p>
<p>We have proved it time and time again.</p>
<p>Our philosophy is that superannuation, retirement, healthcare and daily living is a total package.</p>
<p>And you have a right to this because of your contribution to society.</p>
<p>Today I would like to list some of our plans for after the election.</p>
<p>• New Zealand superannuation will be increased.</p>
<p>• We will subsidise your power bills in winter.</p>
<p>• The SuperGold Card will be extended to include discounts on more items that make up the cost of living.</p>
<p>• We will reduce GST to 10 percent and make the first hundred dollars a week of income tax free.</p>
<p>• We are going to make your communities safer.</p>
<p>• We are going to do more to protect your savings and investments.</p>
<p>Superannuation</p>
<p>You are always playing catch-up.</p>
<p>We are slowly but surely pushing up the rate.</p>
<p>After the next election it will go from 66 percent of the net average wage to 68 percent.</p>
<p>We want it to eventually reach 72.5 percent of the net average wage because of the increasing cost of living but we can only take one step at a time with the competing needs of each group in the community.</p>
<p>Power Bills</p>
<p>We worry that senior citizens face soaring power bills.</p>
<p>Some have to think twice about turning on the heater.</p>
<p>We will subsidise winter power bills starting in June next year.</p>
<p>With our support for the amended Emissions Trading System we have negotiated a deal that mean households, especially those on superannuation, will not bear any cost.</p>
<p>In fact we have a system in place that will assist the elderly have warmer, healthier homes.</p>
<p>It will be a win-win situation.</p>
<p>There were things about the ETS that we did not go along with but we had a choice between influencing the legislation or doing nothing.</p>
<p>Doing nothing was never an option. We could not leave the vulnerable low income households to the mercy of those politicians on the side of the polluters.</p>
<p>SuperGold Card</p>
<p>More discounts are coming for SuperGold cardholders.</p>
<p>The first shipment of updated SuperGold Card directories now contain over 850 businesses and nearly 5000 business outlets.</p>
<p>Hundreds of new businesses have joined since the card was launched.</p>
<p>So use your new directory and the true benefits of the SuperGold Card will become even clearer.</p>
<p>In less than one year your card is more advanced than many equivalent cards in Australia.</p>
<p>When the free off-peak public transport kicks in later this year, along with the extra $500 subsidy for hearing aids the card will be even more valuable.</p>
<p>Reducing GST and Income Tax</p>
<p>We have already announced our policy of reducing GST from 12.5 percent to ten percent.</p>
<p>That will have the effect of making goods cheaper without adding to inflation.</p>
<p>When GST was first announced the architects said the ten percent figure was set in concrete.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards they increased it.</p>
<p>Ten percent GST is sustainable fiscally. And we have more on top of that.</p>
<p>We want the first hundred dollars a week earned by any New Zealander to be tax free.</p>
<p>That means you can earn $5,200 a year with investments before the tax man starts knocking on the door.</p>
<p>Safer Communities</p>
<p>You have the right to feel safe in your homes and on the streets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are some local law and order problems.</p>
<p>We intend to put the local gangs out of business.</p>
<p>You’ll hear more about this later but we have a policy of banning gangs and of dealing to the crime that comes with them.</p>
<p>Investment Protection</p>
<p>The present situation is a shambles.</p>
<p>Over the past few months thousands of people have lost billions of dollars through finance and property company collapses and repayment moratoriums.</p>
<p>Many of those affected have been the elderly. Some have lost everything.</p>
<p>They are being penalised for being prudent and setting something aside for their retirement.</p>
<p>These finance cowboys have to be made accountable. We will do this.</p>
<p>General Comments</p>
<p>New Zealand First has worked to gradually improve things for senior citizens.</p>
<p>In October this year as tax cuts take effect for working New Zealanders, those on superannuation will get a major windfall.</p>
<p>For married couples this means just under $23 a week, with adjusted amounts for other rates of New Zealand Superannuation.</p>
<p>You see we said your superannuation needed to be higher – and it is.</p>
<p>But our commitment does not stop there.</p>
<p>This coming election is about some of the really basic issues.</p>
<p>It&#39;s about the survival of ordinary people in the face of oil price shocks, exorbitant interest rates, price rises, increased crime and threatened unemployment.</p>
<p>We are concerned that people who really should go to the doctor or buy a prescription can&#39;t afford to.</p>
<p>Food costs are soaring – the price of petrol is going through the roof.</p>
<p>We know that life is not easy for you.</p>
<p>We could go on but there is a simple message we have come to deliver.</p>
<p>New Zealand First will look after you.</p>
<p>You can rely on New Zealand First.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
