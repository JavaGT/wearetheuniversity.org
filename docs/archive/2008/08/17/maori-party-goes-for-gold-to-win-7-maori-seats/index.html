<p>The Maori Party campaign to secure the remaining three Maori electorate seats gathers momentum this week with the party’s seven candidates travelling the Hauraki-Waikato electorate together,  after a very successful week touring the Ikaroa Rawhiti electorate to secure the support of Maori voters.</p>
<p>Maori Party co-leaders Hon Tariana Turia and Dr Pita Sharples, MPs Hone Harawira and Te Ururoa Flavell will join candidates Derek Fox, Rahui Katene and Angeline Greensill on tour in a campaign aimed at taking a clean sweep of the seven Maori electorate seats.</p>
<p>Te Tai Tokerau MP Hone Harawira said the party’s four MPs now ensured a Maori voice was heard in parliament – but now it was time to advance the Maori cause further.</p>
<p>“We are touring the Maori electorates to secure the mandate of the remaining Maori electorates. The Maori Party is a voice for Maori, give us your candidate vote and we will make sure that voice is heard in parliament and of influence in the next Government.”</p>
<p>Hauraki-Waikato candidate Angeline Greensill said the coming election was a pivotal one for Maori.</p>
<p>“The Maori Party need your mandate. We need your candidate vote and your party vote so we can affect real change for Maori.”</p>
<p>She urged Maori to join the party’s campaign and to share its messages.</p>

<p>“We are touring the electorate visiting schools, attending the Koroneihana  at Turangawaewae, meeting communities in the Waikato area before heading to South Auckland to visit local councils, employers and businesses” Ms Greensill said. </p>
<p> “I urge everyone to come and meet our people, come and share in our vision. Pita Sharples, Tariana Turia, Hone Harawira, Te Ururoa Flavell, have worked hard to progress Maori aspirations, come and share their vision and my vision to ensure greater influence for Maori in government..</p>
<p>The tour begins in Hamilton at 9am on Tuesday morning, moves to Ngaruawahia  on Wednesday and will end  with a dinner in  Papakura on Thursday night.   </p>
