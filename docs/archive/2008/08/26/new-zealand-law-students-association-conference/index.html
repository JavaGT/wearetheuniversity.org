<p>26th August 2008<br>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>New Zealand Law Students’ Association Conference<br>2nd-6th September 2008</p>
<p>The University of Auckland is proud to host a gathering of New Zealand’s best and brightest law students for the most prestigious event on the law school calendar – the New Zealand Law Students’ Association’s annual conference, which takes place next week.</p>
<p>Over several days, students representing each law school will compete for titles in one of four competitions – Bell Gully Mooting, Russell McVeagh Client Interviewing, Minter Ellison Rudd Watts Witness Examination, and Buddle Findlay Negotiation. They will be judged by a number of respected adjudicators, including learned Justices Chamber and Winkelmann. Competition winners will go on to represent New Zealand at an international level.</p>
<p>An education forum will be held as part of the Association’s commitment to extra-curricular development, featuring speeches from practitioners and academics who are experts in their fields. The Association also holds its annual council meetings during the conference.</p>
<p>Social events are another highlight of the week, giving students the chance to experience Auckland at its best. Conference organisers have planned a pub-crawl, a cocktail party, and a competition of a different sort – an Amazing Race-inspired journey around Waiheke Island in Jeeps! The crowning event of the Conference will be a black tie dinner on Saturday 6th September at Hopetoun Alpha, which will be attended by Governor-General and University of Auckland Law School alumni, the Hon Anand Satyanand.</p>
