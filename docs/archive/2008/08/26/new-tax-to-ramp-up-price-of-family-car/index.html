<p><strong>Tuesday, 26 August 2008, 3:02 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Bill English MP<br>National Party Finance Spokesman</p>
<p>26 August 2008</p>
<p>New tax to ramp up price of family car</p>
<p>National Party Finance spokesman Bill English is warning New Zealanders that the Labour Government is considering a tax that could force up the price of the family car by thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;A Suzuki Swift is to be the new standard for everyone. If your car emits more CO2 than a Suzuki Swift, the tax will apply.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr English says while the emissions tax will apply to new and imported used cars, it is likely to force up the price of second-hand vehicles and, longer-term, possibly the age of the Kiwi car fleet as well.</p>
<p>&quot;Here&#39;s another stealth tax that Labour&#39;s quietly pushing along. Motorists paying through the nose for petrol at the moment won&#39;t welcome new taxes at this time.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr English is referring to a proposed new levy on all new and used imported cars if they do not meet fuel economy standards. The proposed levy is set out in the discussion document &#39;Improving the fuel economy of vehicles entering the New Zealand fleet&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;The family sedan or wagon is likely to go up in price by more than $7,000 by 2015.&quot;</p>
<p>The levy will range from $4,000 for a van in 2009 to $10,000 for a Holden Commodore next year. Labour&#39;s plan is that, starting in 2009, the Government will begin charging importers $150 per gram of CO2 emitted per kilometre travelled above the standard of 214g CO2/km.</p>
<p>&quot;The national standard will be lowered to 170g CO2/km by 2015. That&#39;s the fuel economy of a Suzuki Swift.&quot;</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<p>* The cost of a Toyota Camry (229g CO2/km) will rise $2,250 in 2009, climbing to $8,850 in 2015.</p>
<p>* The cost of a Honda Accord (220g CO2/km) will rise $900 in 2009, climbing to $7,500 in 2015.</p>
<p>* The cost of a Mazda6 (218g CO2/km) will rise $600 in 2009, climbing to $7,200 in 2015.</p>
<p>* The cost of a Toyota Hi-ace (245g CO2/km) will rise $4,650 in 2009, climbing to $11,250 in 2015.</p>
<p>* The cost of a Holden Commodore (282gCO2/km) will rise $10,200 in 2009, climbing to $16,800 in 2015.</p>
<p>As older cars do not have the required fuel economy information, the Government will assess these cars as emitting 400gCO2/km at a cost of some $27,900 by 2009.</p>
