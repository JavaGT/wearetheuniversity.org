<p>AUT Tech Park Conference Centre wins again</p>
<p>AUT University’s Tech Park Conference Centre has gone from strength to strength in recent weeks; first earning itself a four-star Qualmark status, and then winning an ASB Awesome Service Award.</p>
<p>The four-star Qualmark status – New Zealand Tourism’s official mark of quality – cements the Conference Centre’s position as the premium venue in Auckland.</p>
<p>To gain a four star Qualmark status, a conference centre must be deemed to be of an excellent standard in an independent and rigorous assessment. To become part of the Qualmark licensing system, venues will need to be found to be professional and trustworthy in areas of cleanliness, safety, security and comfort. They must also offer a range and quality of services appropriate to their star grade.</p>
<p>The Centre, which boasts nine meeting rooms suitable for between two to 250 people and seven break out rooms; an executive level environment; complete catering services; and a dedicated and experienced team, has received further recognition with the ASB Awesome Service Award.</p>
<p>The prestigious award is sponsored by Newstalk ZB and the Chamber of Commerce, and recognises outstanding service that goes above and beyond what could normally be expected.</p>
<p>The Centre was nominated by a client because of their flexibility in responding to their client’s changing needs and their ability to deliver great service in the face of difficulty.</p>
<p>The Conference Centre Manager Robyn Henry says the four star Qualmark status and the Awesome Service Award are extremely encouraging as they both recognise the centre’s hard work towards excelling in customer service.</p>
<p>“The Qualmark rating is proof that we are one of Auckland’s leading venues, and the Awesome Service Award is recognition for our commitment to embracing our clients’ changing needs and our creative attitude and ability to problem solve.”</p>
