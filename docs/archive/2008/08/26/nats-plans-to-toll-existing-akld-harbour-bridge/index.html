<p><strong>Tuesday, 26 August 2008, 4:20 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>National plans to toll existing Auckland Harbour Bridge</p>
<p>The National Party will toll the Auckland Harbour Bridge once again if it becomes the Government, Transport Minister Annette King said today.</p>
<p>Ms King said that is the only inference to be drawn from National&#39;s failure to refute the comment by its own transport spokesman Maurice Williamson in the New Zealand Herald yesterday that a &quot;dreadful distortion&quot; would be created if tolls were charged on a new tunnel under the harbour while the bridge was kept toll-free.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s leaders, John Key and Bill English, have been falling over each other refuting Mr Williamson&#39;s comments on road tolls, but when it comes to the question of tolling the Harbour Bridge, there has been a deathly silence.</p>
<p>&quot;That is clearly because both Mr Key and Mr English support Mr Williamson&#39;s plan, despite the serious impact a harbour bridge toll would have on tens of thousands of Auckland&#39;s residents and on the Auckland economy generally,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;While a new tunnel under the harbour has the potential to breathe new life into Auckland, National&#39;s plan to toll the bridge at the same time as tolling a tunnel would have the exact opposite effect.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms King said National is trying to cover up its plans for the bridge by introducing a red herring that Labour wants to impose a $10 each way toll on a proposed Transmission Gully route in Wellington.</p>
<p>&quot;That is an absolute fabrication by Bill English. The proposal for a $10 minimum each way toll is actually Mr Williamson&#39;s. He is advocating that tolls should be used to fund Transmission Gully, and if that happened, then the minimum toll would have to be at least $10, and probably more. Labour has no intention of ever allowing a toll of that order to be charged.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has no secret agenda, and it is good to know that, thanks to Mr Williamson, National&#39;s secret agenda is becoming less secret by the day.&quot;</p>
