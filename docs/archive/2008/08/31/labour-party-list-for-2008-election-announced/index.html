<p><strong>Sunday, 31 August 2008, 2:02 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Labour Party list for 2008 election announced</strong></p>
<p>Eight talented New Zealanders will strengthen Labour&#39;s team of MPs in a few months time according to Labour President Mike Williams.</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s 37-strong Moderating Committee met yesterday in Auckland to determine the Party&#39;s most significant list in years.</p>
<p>Mike Williams said the Labour Party has been deliberately operating a programme of renewal for the last few years and it has paid off.</p>
<p>Mr Williams said he had never seen such resolve and determination from the Moderating Committee to ensure new performers were placed high enough on the list to enter Parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;As I predicted our biggest problem was an embarrassment of riches in terms of the very high calibre of our candidates,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The highest ranking non-MP at <strong>number 12</strong> is <strong>DrRajen Prasad</strong> the<br>former Chief Families Commissioner and former Race Relations Conciliator. Dr Prasad has 40 years experience promoting positive relations amongst all New Zealand peoples, including social work, teaching and advocacy for families.</p>
<p>Next on the list of non-MPs at <strong>number 20</strong> is 28-year-old <strong>Jacinda Ardern</strong> currently campaigning from London where she is employed as Senior Policy Advisory to the Home Secretary, Sir Ronnie Flanagan.</p>
<p>Jacinda is President of the International Union of Socialist Youth. IUSY is the largest political youth organisation in the world and holds consultative status with the United Nations. She&#39;s the first NZer and only the second women to lead the organisation in its 100-year history.</p>

<p><strong>Raymond Huo</strong> is at <strong>number 21</strong>. Lawyer and writer, Raymond came to New Zealand in 1994 from Beijing, China. Raymond has an extensive network of contacts throughout the Asian communities in both New Zealand and overseas. Formerly from Brookfields and Hesketh Henry, he has recently joined Queen City Law as a senior associate. He has also been an &quot;on-call&quot; bi-language lawyer for NZ Customs since 2006.</p>
<p><strong>Number 26</strong> is the former global head of policy for Oxfam,<strong>Phil Twyford</strong>. Phil led the humanitarian group&#39;s campaigning and lobbying out of Washington DC for four years. Prior to that he was the founding executive director of Oxfam in New Zealand.</p>
<p>He returned to New Zealand with his family in 2004. Since then he has run NZ Book Month for the bookselling industry, and has worked as an international development consultant. He is secretary of Labour&#39;s Policy Council, serves on its governing council, and is the candidate for North Shore.</p>
<p>Well known CTU Secretary <strong>Carol Beaumont</strong> is next at <strong>number 28.</strong> Carol is expected to win the Maungakiekie seat – long held by Hon Mark Gosche who is retiring from politics after the election. Carol has extensive experience in organisations working for social justice, including unions, women&#39;s, students groups and community health initiatives both here and abroad.</p>
<p><strong>Number 29</strong>is school principal and passionate Maori education advocate <strong>Kelvin Davis</strong>. Kelvin is a television commentator and is Labour&#39;s Te Tai Tokerau candidate. Kelvin&#39;s proven ability in raising Maori achievement will help us help Maori achieve their full potential.</p>
<p>Next amongst those likely to enter Parliament after the election at <strong>number 35</strong> is <strong>Carmel Sepuloni.</strong> Carmel is of Samoan, Tongan and Palagi descent, is a member of the Tonganz Advisory Council and she&#39;s an Equity Manager at the University of Auckland.</p>
<p>Also to enter Parliament is <strong>Stuart Nash</strong> at <strong>number 36</strong> on the list. Stuart is the former Director of Strategic Development at AUT and international marketing and business manager. He is currently Chief Executive of the Art Deco Trust in Napier</p>
