<p>CTU MEDIA RELEASE</p>
<p>25 August 2008</p>
<p>ACC, roads, schools, hospitals – where does it all end?</p>
<p>The growing list of state assets that National wants to privatise is a concern, CTU president Helen Kelly said today.</p>
<p>“Workers will be worried to hear that National thinks it is okay for private companies to own our hospitals, schools, universities and polytechnics.”</p>
<p>“Their proposal to have toll roads, possibly adding $50 a week to use public roads, will also not help at a time when workers are already facing higher food, petrol and housing costs.”</p>
<p>“National has already said it will privatise ACC, putting at risk one of the best schemes in the world for the sake of more profit for Australian Insurance companies but it now appears that privatisation is a core policy plank of many of their policies.”</p>
<p>“Our public services and state assets have been built up by generations of Kiwis. We saw what happened with the privatisation of rail, and we have seen the bill we have been left with to rebuild a decent rail service.”</p>
<p>“New Zealand workers don’t support privatisation and these policy announcements will concern them,” Helen Kelly said.</p>
