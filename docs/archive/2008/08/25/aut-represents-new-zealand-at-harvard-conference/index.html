<p>AUT represents New Zealand at Harvard conference</p>
<p>AUT University business student Michael Teoh added the Kiwi flavour to the Harvard Business Conference held in Malaysia this month - the university&#39;s largest outside of America.</p>
<p>The conference was part of the 2008 Harvard Project for Asian and International Relations (HPAIR) and Teoh, who represented New Zealand, was invited to attend by Harvard University.</p>
<p>The event brings the world&#39;s top executives, researchers and industry experts together with 300 global youth leaders. Delegates discuss the future of business and innovation in Asia-Pacific. This year&#39;s theme was corporate governance and the Asian influence in global business integration.</p>
<p>Youth leaders are selected based on academic and social contributions, intellect and their ability to influence the future of Asia business. The group are further screened to ensure only the world&#39;s best business students attend the conference.</p>
<p>Teoh was the only New Zealand delegate selected by the HPAIR committee. The 21-year-old Sandringham resident is in his third year of a Bachelor of Business degree majoring in marketing and international business.</p>
<p>He says the conference highlighted that New Zealand&#39;s youth leaders are as good as any in the world.</p>
<p>&quot;Let this conference be a starting point for all New Zealand students and our future leaders,&quot; he says. &quot;We should all think and act knowing that our capabilities and dreams can be realised when we put our hearts into them.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders have something valuable to contribute in shaping the world&#39;s future from our resource-filled Asia Pacific hub. We&#39;re rich in land, people and innovation and with the right mindset we can influence and compete globally, and make the world a better place for everyone.&quot;</p>
<p>During the conference, Teoh participated in panel discussions on topics Family-owned Conglomerates in Asia, Asian Media and Entertainment Landscape, Real-Estate and Consumer Marketing and Branding from an Asian Perspective.</p>
<p>Teoh says forging new links with delegates from leading global institutions was an event highlight - Oxford, Harvard, Cambridge, London School of Economics and Warwick universities.</p>
<p>Teoh adds that his goal is to make his mark in the business world, something he seems to have fast-tracked; Teoh is a two-time winner in the SIFE National Competition and Deloitte&#39;s National Case Competition, representing New Zealand and AUT University in global competitions held overseas. He competed in New York at the 2007 SIFE World Cup and he will represent New Zealand again this October in Singapore.</p>
