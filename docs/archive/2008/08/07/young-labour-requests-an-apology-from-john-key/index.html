<p>Young Labour requests an apology from John Key</p>
<p>07 August 2008</p>
<p>Young Labour today requests an apology from John Key after Duncan Garner revealed that his source was not a member of Labour, or any other political party.</p>
<p>Young Labour President, Eric Goddard said, &quot;Mr Key has consistently accused Young Labour of being behind the secret recordings of Bill English and Lockwood Smith being caught out telling the truth at their recent conference.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I expect an apology for his dishonest accusations, which border on a tantrum-like after having our organisation drawn into this scandal in an attempt to deflect Mr Key&#39;s own short comings as a leader. Kiwis deserve better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Key&#39;s knee jerk reaction and strange sense of paranoia has shown he isn&#39;t ready to lead the country, let alone his own party. If National&#39;s &#39;leadership&#39; team are spooked by a bunch of students&#39; how is he going to face the challenges of running the country?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is not the first time Mr Key has wrongly accused Young Labour of being involved in a dirty tricks campaign, despite Young Labour continuing to campaign positively on the issues that matter,&quot; added Goddard.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel that Duncan Garner&#39;s stellar journalism has vindicated Young Labour, and has put the spot light firmly back on John Key and National&#39;s secret agenda,&quot; concluded Goddard</p>
