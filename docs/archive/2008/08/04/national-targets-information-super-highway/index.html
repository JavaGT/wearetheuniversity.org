<p><strong>Monday, 4 August 2008, 10:10 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Judy Kirk National Party President</p>
<p>2 August 2008</p>
<p>National targets information super highway</p>
<p>National Party President, Judy Kirk has today formally launched a new-look web-site in preparation for the election.</p>
<p>The website includes all National&#39;s latest policy releases, the latest media statements from National MPs, profiles on all National&#39;s candidates and video journals from Leader John Key. It also includes new buttons for donating to the party vote campaign, becoming a member or signing up to volunteer to help</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s clear that to be a serious contender in modern politics you have to have a good internet gateway.</p>
<p>&quot;People want the opportunity to take a balanced look at what parties are offering, with the sort of focus that you don&#39;t always get in mainstream news programmes.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Kirk says a major focus of the Party over coming months will be to drive on-line donations, through the website, to the Party&#39;s election fighting fund.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to give the many thousands of Kiwis who want a better future for New Zealand the opportunity to be part of our campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;The trend internationally, including the US, is to encourage grass-roots, internet-based democracy where everyone pitches in. We think that&#39;s healthy and our new web site promotes that.</p>
<p>&quot;Any amount of money people can give will help. It&#39;s donations from ordinary New Zealanders that will make all the difference to our party vote campaign.&quot;</p>
<p>The new National website is fully funded by the Party and its supporters.</p>
