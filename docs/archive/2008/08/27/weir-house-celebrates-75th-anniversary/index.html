<p><strong>Wednesday, 27 August 2008, 2:45 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a></strong></p>
<p>Weir House Celebrates 75th Anniversary</p>
<p>Victoria University’s first wholly-owned hall of residence, Weir House, will celebrate its 75th anniversary at a major reunion event in Wellington this November.</p>
<p>Since opening its doors in 1933, Weir House has been a Victoria University and Wellington icon.</p>
<p>Today the popular hall of residence houses 315 students and is known for being home to some of Victoria’s brightest young scholars who go on to be successful alumni in Wellington, New Zealand and around the world.</p>
<p>“Weir House has been an integral part of Victoria’s culture and has contributed to the University’s life in many ways. It’s provided a home away from home to many students and a base from which they’ve explored and enjoyed New Zealand’s capital city,” says Professor Tim Beaglehole, Victoria University Chancellor and former Weir House warden. </p>
<p>Unlike some other halls of residence, Weir House has always been able to select its residents, and has attracted high calibre ones. There is also a tradition of people from the same family residing at Weir House during their university years.</p>
<p>The major event during the reunion weekend—to run from November 14 to 16, 2008—will be the international evening and dinner on Saturday 15 November at Te Papa, New Zealand’s national museum.</p>
<p>“International evenings have been a tradition at Weir House since the 1970s, and this evening will be a perfect opportunity to meet old friends at the same time as enjoying cultural performances and international cuisine,” says Professor Beaglehole.</p>

<p>Other events include:</p>
<p>Victoria University science and art tours including the Adam Art Gallery and the Centre for Biodiscovery;<br>a Weir House debate on the topic ‘my real education took place at Weir House’ by students from Victoria’s successful debating society;<br>a champagne brunch;<br>a Weir House open day; and<br>a family day including croquet and a picnic.</p>
<p>Reunion participants will also have the opportunity to stay at Weir House for a night or two in Wellington—perhaps even in their old room.</p>
<p>Victoria University’s alumni office has been working to connect with former residents and staff to update contact details before the reunion.</p>
<p>Jane and Leon Fulcher, who were the Weir House wardens from 1986 to 2004, are currently authoring a book entitled Weir Tales: 75 Years of History and Student Achievements which will be available for sale throughout the reunion weekend. All proceeds will go to future Weir House scholarships.</p>
<p>“During our 17 years as wardens at Weir House, we saw many wonderfully talented and gifted students pass through the doors and go on to do some fantastic things.  Although the vast majority came from New Zealand, others came from as far away as Finland, Argentina, Nepal, China, Japan, Russia, Canada, USA and Africa as well as from all around the Pacific. Some of the students that were at Weir House when we were wardens include current All Black Conrad Smith, poet Miranda Johnson and MPs Simon Power and Darren Hughes. Others went on to be diplomats, musicians, actors, academics, lawyers, accountants, teachers, architects, tour guides and marine biologists,” says Mrs Fulcher.  </p>
