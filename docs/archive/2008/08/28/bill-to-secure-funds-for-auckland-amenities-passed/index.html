<p>Judith Tizard<br>MP for Auckland Central</p>
<p>27 August 2008</p>
<p>Media Statement<br>Bill to secure funding for Auckland Amenities passed</p>
<p>Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard is tonight celebrating the passing in Parliament, by an overwhelming majority, of the Auckland Regional Amenities Funding Bill. Judith Tizard was the sponsor of this bill.</p>
<p>The Bill establishes a statutory framework for the secure and sustainable funding of ten important services and organisations that provide services and facilities across the Auckland region.</p>
<p>&quot;I am delighted that this bill has been passed. It has been a truly sustained team effort over some 4 years which has seen 10 organisations come together to draft and promote this Private Bill for the good of Auckland,&quot; said Judith Tizard.</p>
<p>&quot;Auckland is an international city, and cities of an international standing require, and their residents expect, access to certain facilities and services in the areas of arts, culture and entertainment, as well as public and community facilities such as rescue services.</p>
<p>The Bill will initially provide funding for:<br> Auckland Observatory and Planetarium Trust Board;<br> Auckland Philharmonia;<br> Auckland Regional Rescue Helicopter Trust;<br> Auckland Theatre Company Limited;<br> Coastguard Northern Region Incorporated;<br> New Zealand National Maritime Museum Trust Board;<br> New Zealand Opera Limited;<br> Surf Life Saving Northern Region Incorporated;<br> The Auckland Festival Trust; and<br> WaterSafe Auckland Incorporated.</p>

<p>&quot;These organisations that are used by, enjoyed, or relied on by many people across the Auckland region. They are part of the essential fabric of Auckland and contribute towards making the region a vibrant and desirable place to live in, to work in, and to visit.</p>
<p>The Bill establishes the Auckland Regional Amenities Funding Board, which will be the conduit between the organisations and the contributing authorities (via the Territorial Local Authority Electoral College).</p>
<p>It specifies the particular Amenities that will qualify for funding. It will also sets out a process by which new organisations can be added to the list and includes a mechanism for existing Amenities to be removed from qualifying for funding.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bill will set out the procedure for the approval and distribution of funding to the Amenities. It will secure the future of Auckland&#39;s important amenities through funding that is sourced proportionately from all territorial authorities in the region, under current governance structures. Further, it will allow these amenities to continue to provide and grow world-class services and facilities that the residents of the Auckland region expect,&quot; said Judith Tizard.</p>
