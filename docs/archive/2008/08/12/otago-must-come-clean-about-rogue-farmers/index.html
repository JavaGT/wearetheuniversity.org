<p>Otago must come clean about rogue farmers</p>
<p>Otago Regional Council must stop protecting names of persistent polluters if it is serious about the problem of worsening river quality in the region, Green Party Co-Leader Russel Norman says.</p>
<p>&quot;The council is running a &#39;Watering the Future&#39; forum this week in Cromwell after a &#39;water quality workshop&#39; last month at Clydevale Hall and I totally support getting farmers and others around the table in this way.</p>
<p>&quot;But keeping secret the names of a small minority who offend against council pollution rules gives an impression the council is firmly on the side of polluters rather than the wider community and environment,&quot; Dr Norman says.</p>
<p>The Green Party has been trying for weeks to get names of offenders from the council without result and a direct email from Dr Norman to council chief executive Graeme Martin nearly a week ago (see attached) has not been answered either.</p>
<p>&quot;Names of the worst polluters should not only be supplied to us, they should be listed on the council&#39;s website and available to everyone so there is real pressure, not just talk.</p>
<p>&quot;On July 15 the regional council said in a statement that, &#39;It isn&#39;t acceptable to the community, including farmers and the regional council, for the water quality of streams and rivers of South and West Otago to continue to deteriorate&#39;,&quot; Dr Norman says.</p>
<p>&quot;On June 13, The Otago Daily Times reported Otago Regional Councillor Duncan Butcher saying, &#39;Money, education and consultation with industry have failed to achieve the environmental outcomes the council and community desire of dairy farms&#39;.</p>
<p>Says Dr Norman, &quot;Let&#39;s continue the consultation, but it&#39;s time also to get tougher, and more honest, about individual polluters.&quot;</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
