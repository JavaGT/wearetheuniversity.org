<p>Stop Stealing Our Thunder Says Peters</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters has asked the Labour Party to stop stealing all New Zealand First’s thunder over benefits for senior citizens that take effect today.</p>
<p>Mr Peters says the Prime Minister and her colleagues are riding around in trains and buses claiming credit for free off-peak travel which New Zealand First insisted on as part of its SuperGold Card deal.</p>
<p>“While we are delighted to improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of senior citizens, we are not so pleased to have the Labour Party trying to grab the glory.</p>
<p>“We negotiated those concessions and we did the work.</p>
<p>“The SuperGold Card was our policy and we intend to go further with the benefits after the next election, including power, petrol and other concessions,” said Mr Peters.</p>
