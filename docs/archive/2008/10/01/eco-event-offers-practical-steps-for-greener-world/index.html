<p>Eco-event offers practical steps for a greener world</p>
<p>Sustainable self, sustainable world: that’s the message of an upcoming conference on eco-friendly lifestyles. The two-day event, which is open to the public, will be held at the University of Canterbury on the fourth and fifth of October. The conference will focus on positive actions that will benefit both participants and the environment.</p>
<p>The conference is being organised by University of Canterbury student environmental club Kakariki. It is the first such event organised by the club. Co-President Hayes Zirnhelt said it was important for the topics on offer to engage and motivate people. “We wanted the conference to be about things that people can do in their lives that will make a real difference.”</p>
<p>Presenters include Waveney Warth, who with husband Matthew is attempting to live rubbish-free for a year (and writing about it on their popular blog rubbishfreeyear.co.nz), Oamaru ‘Dirt Doctor’ Jim O’Gorman, and Professor Ian Spellerberg from Te Ara Kakariki (Canterbury Greenway Trust). There will also be electric vehicle demonstrations, gardening workshops, discussion of sustainable development issues, eco-housing, green shopping and more.</p>
<p>Participants will be provided with lunch sourced from local organic food. There will be an optional dinner on Saturday night with live music.</p>
<p>Kakariki Co-President Shona Walter says, “A lot of people are aware that they should be doing something about the environment but aren’t quite sure what. The conference is a chance to learn about practical actions you can take from a wide range of expert presenters, and meet other people who are interested in the same things.”</p>

<p>Zirnhelt adds, “The environmental threats facing the planet mean we can’t go on living as we have been. The conference will provide a fun and relaxed atmosphere to learn about ways we can change our lifestyles to ensure the survival of the planet and also lead healthier, more satisfying lives.”</p>
<p>The conference will be held in the University of Canterbury’s Commerce Building. It will run from 9:00 am to 5:30 pm on Saturday the fourth of October, and 9:00 am to 4:00 pm on Sunday the fifth. The cost is $5 per day for pre-registrations, or $7 at the door.
