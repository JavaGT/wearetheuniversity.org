<p>Education Minister fails comprehension</p>
<p>National Party Education spokeswoman Anne Tolley says Education Minister Chris Carter has either failed a basic test of comprehension, or is trying to deliberately misrepresent National’s policy to raise educational standards.</p>
<p>“Clearly I want to give the Minister the benefit of the doubt, and will assume it’s a simple case of Mr Carter failing to understand.</p>
<p>“As John Key clearly stated when he announced National’s plan to raise educational standards ‘this is not School C for six year olds’ as some people put it.</p>
<p>“There will be no national exams for primary school kids. That is not our policy, never has been, and it is not on our agenda.</p>
<p>National&#39;s policy is to introduce three key requirements for all primary and intermediate schools:</p>
<p>Clear National Standards: Set national standards in reading, writing and numeracy. The standards will describe all the things children should be able to do by a particular age or year at school. They will be defined by benchmarks in a range of tests.</p>
<p>Effective Assessment: Require primary schools to use assessment programmes that compare the progress of their students with other students across the country. Schools will choose from a range of tests, but there won&#39;t be national exams.</p>
<p>Upfront Reporting: Give parents the right to see all assessment information, and to get regular reports about their child&#39;s progress towards national standards. Schools will also have to report each year on the whole school&#39;s performance against national standards.</p>

<p>“Currently, around one in five leave without NCEA Level 1, and many don&#39;t achieve even basic reading, writing and maths skills.</p>
<p>“National’s policy will lift education standards to ensure our children are better equipped for the future.</p>
<p>“Should Chris Carter like to acquaint himself with what John Key actually said in April 2007 the National Party Leader’s speech is available at: <a href="http://www.national.org.nz/Article.aspx?articleId=9817.%E2%80%9D">http://www.national.org.nz/Article.aspx?articleId=9817.”</a></p>
