<p>Tony Ryall MP<br>National Party Health Spokesman</p>
<p>1 October 2008</p>
<p>Health workforce crisis deepens</p>
<p>National Party health spokesman Tony Ryall says new figures showing the number of medical practices which are closing their books should add fresh urgency to any Government response.</p>
<p>&quot;Patients are waiting longer and longer to see their doctor. That&#39;s if they can get on the books. Labour&#39;s had nine years to start dealing with the crisis. Instead, they&#39;ve ordered 55 reports, and the current grand plan is to get a new group of bureaucrats to provide new reports.</p>
<p>&quot;There are now fewer GPs in New Zealand than there were in 1999.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ryall says the answer to an official Parliamentary question shows that across the country dozens of practices have closed their books.</p>
<p>&quot;Thousands of patients are struggling to find a family GP and that is no good for patients.</p>
<p>&quot;This needs to be laid alongside the staffing crisis that has been allowed to develop in hospitals.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ryall says National has a comprehensive plan to start tackling the health workforce crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course it starts with our economic programme which includes better after-tax incomes and a growing economy. In the past week, National has also unveiled plans to significantly increase the number of medical students and GP training places*, and offer voluntary bonding arrangements for doctors, nurses, and midwives who agree to work in hard-to-staff areas**.</p>
<p>&quot;We have also been long time advocates for doctors and nurses to be given more trust in the running of our health services.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ryall says the current Labour Government is quietly moving to adopt many of National&#39;s ideas, but in the interim, David Cunliffe is calling for a new group of bureaucrats to provide him with more reports.</p>
<p>&quot;That really is a pathetic response to a long-running crisis.&quot;</p>
