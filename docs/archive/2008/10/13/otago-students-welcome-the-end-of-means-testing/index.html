<p><strong>Monday, 13 October 2008, 5:27 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association">Otago University Students Association</a></strong></p>
<p>Otago Students Welcome the End of Means Testing.</p>
<p>Today well over 1000 students gathered at Otago University to listen to Prime Minister Helen Clark.</p>
<p>Her announcement of the phased introduction of a universal allowance was met with applause from the crowd.</p>
<p>“The crowd loved it, they were thrilled to hear that Labour has been listening to students’concerns” Said Otago University Students’ Association President Simon Wilson.</p>
<p>Labour’s plan will see allowances completely phased out by 1 January 2012. Currently only around a third of students receive an allowance, the remaining two thirds are forced to borrow to live.</p>
<p>“Means testing of parental income was always a ridiculous way to judge whether a student needed an allowance. Its great to see that the end is in sight” Said Wilson.</p>
<p>Students are the only group in New Zealand society who are currently forced to borrow to live. Across the country students are celebrating the end of this backwards system.</p>
