<p>Media Release</p>

<p>English confirms public servants will lose jobs under National</p>
<p>Comments by Bill English on Agenda yesterday, and on Radio New Zealand today have confirmed the National Party’s policy that hard-working public servants in Wellington will lose their jobs, Labour Candidate for Wellington Central, Grant Robertson said today.</p>
<p>“I have been saying for some time that public servants can’t trust National to keep their jobs safe and Bill English’s comments confirm that. National have decided to use so-called ‘backroom’ public servants as a political tool. The on-going use of the term ‘bureaucrat’ by National also reveals the value they place on public services and public servants,” Grant said.</p>
<p>In response to questioning from Guyon Espiner on Agenda yesterday, Bill English said that public servants may well lose their jobs under National. He went further on Radio New Zealand this morning specifically targeting the Tertiary Education Commission staff, as well as other key support staff in areas such as communications would be likely to lose their jobs.</p>
<p>“National is trying to divide public servants between ‘frontline’ and ‘backroom’ staff. As a former public servant I know that both are needed to provide New Zealanders with the services that the need and deserve,”</p>
<p>“As Wellington Central MP I will be a strong advocate for public servants. New Zealand can be rightly proud that our public services have been ranked number one in the world by Transparency International. I know that public servants work hard for the government of the day, whoever it is,’</p>
<p>“Under Labour public services have been re-built. Now is the time to find ways to be innovative and more efficient. This is best done by supporting strong public services, not using them as a political tool”.</p>
