<p>Labour Borrows Another Policy – NZ First</p>
<p>Rt Hon Winston Peters has welcomed the Labour Party’s move to adopt New Zealand First’s longstanding policy of a universal student allowance.</p>
<p>Labour today announced a three-year timetable to reinstate a universal living allowance for students under 24.</p>
<p>Mr Peters says the policy is long overdue and should be accepted by all political parties so that investment in education does not become a political football.</p>
<p>“Paying a student allowance is an investment for the future. Our future as a country is being jeopardised by massive student debt.</p>
<p>“Young men and women are graduating from our tertiary institutions with student loans that they cannot afford to repay and many head overseas.</p>
<p>“The next step is to introduce a scheme that enables students to repay loans by working in areas of high need, such as medicine, for a specified time.</p>
<p>“This system was used successfully in the past and gave great benefits to the students and their employers,” said Mr Peters.</p>
