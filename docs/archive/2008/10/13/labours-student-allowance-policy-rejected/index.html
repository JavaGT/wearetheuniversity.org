<p>ACT on Campus rejects Labour&#39;s student allowance policy</p>
<p>ACT on Campus, the youth wing of ACT New Zealand, rejects Labour&#39;s student allowance policy. National President Mike Bridge said today that &quot;$210m would be much better spent investing in quality education than propping up the local student bar.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s student allowance scheme will see hard working taxpayers such as truck drivers, dairy owners and drainlayers subsidising the children of the very people that Michael Cullen labelled &#39;rich pricks&#39;. This is the ultimate tax cut for the wealthy and will do nothing for the people Labour claim to represent.</p>
<p>&quot;If Labour were serious about improving the financial prospects for students, they would be increasing real wages so that young graduates are not forced to head overseas to get ahead. The key to better wages is reducing taxes and growing the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;In the last nine years Labour&#39;s financial incompetence and ineptitude have failed the next generation of New Zealanders by running the economy into the ground. Even more reckless spending is the last thing that young kiwis need during these uncertain economic times&quot; Mr Bridge said.</p>
