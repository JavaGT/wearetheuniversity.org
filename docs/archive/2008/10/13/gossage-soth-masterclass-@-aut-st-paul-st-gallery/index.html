<p>A unique opportunity to spend 3 up-close days with John Gossage and Alec Soth two of the most influential American photographers working today.</p>
<p>Friday January 16th - Sunday January 18th 2009</p>
<p>AUT School of Art and Design, ST PAUL ST Gallery, Auckland City</p>
<p>Facilitated over three days by Harvey Benge, John and Alex will talk about their working methods and outline the strategies they have developed to shape their own unique photographic styles and approaches. From a position that &quot;anything is possible&quot; the workshop will look at photo based art practise in a post-modern digital cyber world where the possibilities for making and showing work are endless. Participants will also have the opportunity to have their work constructively reviewed by John and Alec who will offer feedback and suggest ways forward.</p>
<p>Bruce Connew comments on a previous workshop..&quot;I must congratulate the AUT School of Art and Design for hosting an extraordinary workshop with Harvey Benge, Peter Biolabrezski and the incomparable Antoine D&#39;Agata. All are world class, at the top of their respective games, while one in particular is on his way to greatness - should he survive the journey. These workshops offer a rare and honest insight into world class photographers practices and the varied and complex world of photo art. They give each participating photographer a way forward, no matter the stage of career. That AUT should be involved in assisting Harvey Benge to bring such an intellectual and accomplished level of photographer to New Zealand is an absolute credit to the School&#39;s commitment to photography. Very, very well done....these workshops are career-defining days for any photographer.&quot;</p>
