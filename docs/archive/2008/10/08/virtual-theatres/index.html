<p>Virtual Theatres</p>
<p>Victoria University Senior Lecturer John Downie will this month curate ‘Virtual Theatres’, a series of installations by staff and students in the Film and Theatre programmes.</p>
<p>To be exhibited at the Adam Art Gallery, the original installation works will demonstrate current research experiments with performance and audiovisual technologies.</p>
<p>“While we still think we know what we are talking about when we use the terms &#39;theatre&#39; and &#39;film&#39;, everyday digital technologies now enhance a performer&#39;s expressive range within space and time quite beyond character-based representation, as well as expanding the spectator&#39;s own sense of being present at a performance,” says Mr Downie.</p>
<p>Installations include:</p>
<p>‘Metamorphosal’ – using three flat screens to explore ideas about indoctrination, cure and obedience;<br>‘Terminal’ – invoking the sensations and metaphysics of the modern airport by a mixture of objects and projection;<br>‘He is still alive and speaks to himself rationally’ – a meditative take on the Asian ‘Monkey’ fable, employing three different projection spaces and compelling sound;<br>‘Epistrophe’ –making play with the repetitions of the everyday that continue to inhabit antiquated furniture and screens;<br>‘Bound’ – placing real stones, within which can be seen the figure of her own father, grappling with some of the story elements of the Prometheus myth;<br>‘Styx’ – exhibited in honour of the artist’s pet snake, in the gallery’s lift; and<br>‘My Space’ – a provocation about identity, ownership and the transference of the intangible.
