<p><strong>Wednesday, 8 October 2008, 12:48 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>John Key MP<br>National Party Leader</p>
<p>8 October 2008</p>
<p><strong>Economic plan: Superannuitants get a boost</strong></p>
<p>National Party Leader John Key has unveiled an economic management plan that will provide a much-needed boost to weekly superannuation payments.</p>
<p>“Because superannuation is calculated on the average wage, our economic package and our commitment to maintain superannuation rates at 66% of the average wage will see a subsequent rise in the incomes of retired New Zealanders receiving superannuation.”</p>
<p>Mr Key says National is determined to lift the incomes and living standards of all New Zealanders, and today’s announcement fulfils a pledge he made at the party’s annual conference in August.</p>
<p>“I’m also repeating the other pledges I made then.</p>
<p>“National will retain all the superannuation entitlements and eligibility rules that our senior citizens currently enjoy. We will keep this pledge and I will resign as Prime Minister, and as a member of our Parliament, rather than break it.</p>
<p>Mr Key says the pre-election opening of the books has been fully considered.</p>
<p>“As careful economic managers, National has been deliberately cautious in its approach. Now is not the time for unaffordable spending promises, but a time for a practical programme that will help drive economic growth, which is what we are delivering.</p>
<p>“I am confident that by growing the after-tax wages of all workers, some of the many thousands of children and grand-children who are making their homes overseas will now choose to make their futures here.”</p>
