<p>United Future well-received on campus</p>
<p>Auckland students received United Future leader Peter Dunne positively today when he spoke in the AUSA Quad this afternoon, highlighting the party’s zero-fees tertiary education policy.</p>
<p>United Future’s tertiary education policy focuses on abolishing tuition fees, while also ensuring high quality tertiary education. AUSA believes this will go a long way to lowering financial barriers to higher education, as well as attacking student debt at the source.</p>
<p>“While our main focus this year has been on pushing a universal student allowance, we welcome this policy as a useful contribution to the tertiary education policy mix. Both approaches help students and ensure access to higher education,” says AUSA President David Do.</p>
<p>Peter Dunne mingled and chatted with students after his speech today. He appeared to be well-received by students and students were interested in learning more about the party’s policies.</p>
<p>Note: Some photos of his speech are attached.</p>
