<p>John Key&#39;s Campaign Blog</p>
<p>14 October 2008</p>
<p>Yesterday I flew to Gisborne to announce National&#39;s crusade on literacy and numeracy.</p>
<p>I got a great welcome when I visited Kaiti Primary and Gisborne Boys High schools to speak to pupils and staff. [Click the image for video from this trip]</p>
<p>Education is something I&#39;m really passionate about.  The fact is that we need to provide children with decent literacy and numeracy skills.</p>
<p>Under our National Standards policy, we will set standards in literacy and numeracy and require every primary and intermediate school pupil to be assessed regularly against them.</p>
<p>Schools will have to explain to parents in plain English how their child is doing compared to these National Standards and compared to other children their age.</p>
<p>I care about the future of our children, and their future can only be guaranteed if they have a decent education.</p>
<p>It will be one of the ways that New Zealanders can measure me by - through my desire to see our education system produce better educated young people.</p>
<p>Our crusade on literacy and numeracy will cost $47 million a year, including $18 million targeted at pupils who aren&#39;t meeting National Standards, $4 million to tackle the problem of truancy, and extra money for children with special education needs.</p>
<p>At the moment there are too many young people - one in five in fact - who are leaving school without the qualifications and skills they need to succeed.</p>
<p>Those kids are New Zealand&#39;s future.</p>
<p>If we don&#39;t get this basic building block right, we won&#39;t get far.</p>
