<p><strong>Tuesday, 14 October 2008, 8:59 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Labour is writing cheques it can’t cash</p>
<p>Helen Clark needs to tell New Zealanders how she plans to fund her parade of new spending announcements, including the big spending plan to introduce universal student allowances.</p>
<p>“Helen Clark has decided she is going to spend her way to the election. That is what she is telling us today. But she has given herself a ‘get out of jail free card’ with a mini-Budget after the election.”</p>
<p>National’s Finance spokesman Bill English is responding to another big spending initiative on student allowances this afternoon.</p>
<p>“A Universal Student Allowance is an admirable goal and National will be making some changes to the allowance in its own, yet to be announced, tertiary education policy.</p>
<p>“It will be more generous than the current scheme, but won’t be universal.</p>
<p>“However, our priority is literacy and numeracy, and the one in five kids who never get a qualification - let alone make it to University.</p>
<p>“But Helen Clark is being reckless by making these sorts of promises and offering no advice on how any of it is to be funded.</p>
<p>“The most we’ve got from Helen Clark is that Labour will have a mini-budget after the election when she will reveal how unaffordable all the promises have been. Which promises is Labour planning to break?”</p>
