<p>Student Allowances Announcement Welcomed</p>
<p>President Tangi Tipene welcomed the announcement by the Prime Minister yesterday of the intention to phase out parental income testing. “Our union has always had the view that the cost of tertiary education to students must be reduced and this is a good first step” Ms Tipene said.</p>
<p>However she went on to warn that such moves should not be done at the expense of adequate funding for the tertiary education sector. “This sector has been woefully underfunded and in the case of the ITP part of the sector this has had the potential to affect quality. Our young people deserve, and the country needs high quality, affordable education” Ms Tipene said.</p>
<p>She went on to say that a universal allowance would help ease the debt burden that has spiralled out of control and enable students to access and engage with education without having to worry about paying the rent or having to have two jobs in order to feed themselves. “No matter who forms the next government this matter must be addressed” she said.</p>
