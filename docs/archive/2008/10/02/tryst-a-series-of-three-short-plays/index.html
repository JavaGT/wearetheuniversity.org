<p><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tryst: a series of three short plays</strong></p>
<p>Early in October three talented Victoria University directing students will take you on a surreal exploration of identity, self, and lust at its most primal. <em>Tryst</em> is a series of three short plays that meet each other thematically to explore basic human connections.</p>
<p>The fourth and final installment from Victoria University’s directing course for 2008, <em>Tryst</em> marks the directorial debut for these students and the culmination of three years’ study.</p>
<p><em>Tryst</em>’s three plays will rendezvous back to back in Victoria’s <em>Studio 77</em>, providing a diverse and fast-paced evening of theatre.</p>
<p><strong><em>Terminating or Sonnet LXXV, or Lass meine Schmerzen nicht veloren sein, or Ambivalence</em></strong><br>Written by Pulitzer Prize winning playwright Tony Kushner, this short play with a long title, usually just called <em>Terminating</em>, is based on Shakespeare’s 75th sonnet. Like the sonnet, which begins “So are you to my thoughts as food to life”, Kushner’s play considers loving and not loving, lust and repulsion.<br>Directed by Charlotte Bradley this production, a Wellington premiere, sees a group of young and talented actors make Kushner’s lyrical language sing; engaging their bodies and their brains to produce an intelligent, yet unpretentious, look at the complications of the heart, and of the crotch.  </p>
<p><strong><em>The Successful Life of Three –</em> A Skit for Vaudeville</strong><br>This award-winning play from Cuban-born Maria Irene Fornes is an engaging invitation into the bizarre lives of <em>He</em>, <em>She</em> and <em>Three</em>. Playing off the traditions of vaudeville and silent movies, this play explores universal questions: &quot;Who am I?; Who are you?; Why are you so annoying?; and What am I doing in this relationship?!?”<br>Of her production, director Tamsin Dashfield says: “More truthful than reality, this play promises to challenge the myths of our time and delight the audience”.</p>

<p><strong><em>Salve Regina</em></strong><br>From New Zealand’s own Edward Bowman comes this dark play that inhabits a post-apocalyptic world and deals with humanity’s downfall. Exploring themes of savagery, sex, gender, power and control, it paints a shocking portrait of mankind’s capacity to give up anything to reproduce.<br>Director Sam Smith’s production of <em>Salve Regina</em> is a highly stylised performance that blends conventions of Commedia dell’Arte, Absurdism and Elizabethan theatre to create a fresh and engaging production, one that Smith suggests “inhabits the realm of the grotesque”.</p>
<p>The experience of directing in this course is summed up by Dashfield: “This process has been one of discovery – about theatre, about the play, the cast, the collaborators, and most of all about myself”.</p>
