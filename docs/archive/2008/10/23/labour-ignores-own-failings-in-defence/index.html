<p>Labour ignores own failings in defence</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s defence policy released today glosses over and ignores serious problems, says National&#39;s Defence spokesman, Wayne Mapp.</p>
<p>&quot;The New Zealand Defence Force&#39;s own annual report this year revealed significant problems which Labour simply has not even acknowledged.&quot;</p>
<p>They include:</p>
<p>* The MRV Canterbury faces huge questions about equipment and capability. It is unable to perform some operations.</p>
<p>* The Navy&#39;s six new patrol boats, (four in-shore and two off-shore patrol boats) still can&#39;t pass their Lloyds survey and are therefore unable to be delivered.</p>
<p>* The Air Force&#39;s two 757s have been out of circulation since last November.</p>
<p>* Only two of the Navy&#39;s five helicopters are fully in service.</p>
<p>* Army units are staffed as low as 39%.</p>
<p>* Land combat forces are partially prepared for low-level conflicts only and the Army is not prepared for higher threat situations.</p>
<p>* The Army cannot provide logistic and medical support or a sustainable Engineer Squadron, a Signals Squadron or a Military Police Platoon to support an Infantry Battalion.</p>
<p>* There are insufficient personnel to sustain the Maritime Patrol Fleet on continuous operations.</p>
<p>&quot;The NZDF annual report makes for very grim reading indeed.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, Labour&#39;s policy fails to address serious shortcomings in the use of taxpayers&#39; money. The helicopter replacement programme, which was originally forecast to cost between $400 and $560 million, has blown out to $910 million.</p>

<p>&quot;The Auditor General had to abandon an audit of major procurement projects under Labour because the projects were so poorly managed that Kevin Brady couldn&#39;t even find enough information to conduct an audit on.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour&#39;s belated recognition of the need for a Defence White Paper is grudging at best. Just two weeks ago, following National&#39;s call for a White Paper, the Minister claimed that, &quot;to have a White Paper is really just a thinly disguised admission of having no policy at all.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides the much needed focus on recruitment and retention, Labour&#39;s policy fails to address the major issues facing our Defence Forces. The Minister&#39;s words best describe his own failed policy.&quot;</p>
