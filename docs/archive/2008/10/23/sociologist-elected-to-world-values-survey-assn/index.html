<p>Thursday, October 23, 2008<br>Sociologist elected to World Values Survey Association board</p>
<p>Dr Paul Perry was elected to the scientific advisory board of the World Values Survey Association at its conference and general assembly in Istanbul recently.</p>
<p>Dr Perry, a senior lecturer in Sociology in the School of People, Environment and Planning, has been as principal investigator in the New Zealand study of values since 1985.</p>
<p>The World Values Survey Association is an international network of social scientists studying changing values and their impact on society.</p>
<p>Large-scale national surveys are carried out across the simultaneously. Surveys have been undertaken at least once in 97 countries, over five different rounds, since the 1980s.</p>
<p>The most recent round, 2005-07, saw surveys carried out in 60 countries including New Zealand.</p>
<p>The scientific advisory board is comprised of individuals from 12 countries. It will have a key role in developing the questionnaire for the next round of the World Values Survey.</p>
<p>Dr Perry says his being part of the scientific advisory board will lift the profile of New Zealand within the international organisation and allow greater involvement in the shape of the next survey round.</p>
<p>President of the World Values Association Professor Ronald Inglehart will visit Massey on November 20, when he will give a public lecture on Changing Mass Attitudes and Democracy.</p>
<p>Professor Inglehart is Research Professor at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>His visit is part of a series of speaking engagements in November, part of Fulbright New Zealand’s 60th anniversary celebrations.</p>
<p>The Massey lecture will be in the Japan Lecture Theatre at the Manawatu campus at 11am.</p>
