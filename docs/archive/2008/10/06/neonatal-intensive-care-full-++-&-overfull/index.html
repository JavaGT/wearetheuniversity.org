<p><strong>Monday, 6 October 2008, 12:09 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Katrina Shanks<br>National Party MP</p>
<p>6 October 2008</p>
<p>Neonatal intensive care: ‘full ++’ &amp; ‘overfull’</p>
<p>There’s a critical shortage of beds available for our most vulnerable newborns, says National Party MP Katrina Shanks.</p>
<p>“Over the weekend there were just two cots spare for neo-natal intensive care throughout the country. This is despite assurances the capacity issues were just a seasonal blip.”</p>
<p>In July Labour minister Steve Chadwick assured Parliament that it would be fixed by adding another bureaucrat, but two months later, mothers and their babies still have nowhere to go.</p>
<p>“Auckland hospital’s neonatal intensive care is ‘overfull’, Middlemore describes its situation as ‘Full++’, and Waikato is ‘very full’.</p>
<p>Mrs Shanks says the situation has the potential to put new mums and their babies at risk.</p>
<p>“We understand a mother about to give birth was moved from Auckland to Christchurch at 1am because there was nowhere in the North Island that could care for her.</p>
<p>“It is simply not good enough. New Zealand needs maternity services that mothers and their babies can rely on.”</p>
<p>Mrs Shanks says the current situation is exacerbated by severe shortages of midwives for expectant mothers.</p>
<p>“For example, as at 31st March this year the Counties Manukau DHB had 40 permanent midwifery vacancies, and Waitemata DHB had 21 vacancies at 31st April.</p>
<p>“These shortages result in mothers being unable to find a lead maternity carer for their baby.</p>
<p>“National has been raising these issues for some time and offering solutions such as student loan write-offs for health professionals in hard-to-staff areas and specialties, better integration between midwives, GPs and obstetricians, and the development of clinical networks.”</p>
