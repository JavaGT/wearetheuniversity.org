<p>Brash joins AUT</p>
<p>Former Reserve Bank Governor Dr Don Brash has been appointed Adjunct Professor of Banking to the AUT Business School.</p>
<p>Dean of the AUT Business School Professor Des Graydon says the appointment recognises Dr Brash&#39;s outstanding wealth of knowledge in monetary policy and banking regulation.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Brash&#39;s understanding of the inner-workings of New Zealand&#39;s financial system is second to none,&quot; he says. &quot;We are delighted to have him share his insight with staff and students.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Brash gained his PhD in Economics from the Australian National University in 1965. He is most known for his 14-year tenure as Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, where he gained a reputation for keeping tight control of inflation. In July 2002, Dr Brash became a Member of Parliament for the National Party, and became Leader of the National Party for three years from October 2003.</p>
<p>Today, Dr Brash is chair of Huljich Wealth Management and holds directorships with Ocean Partners and ANZ National Bank, where he is chair of the Risk Committee. In 2007, he was appointed Adjunct Professor at Melbourne&#39;s La Trobe University in the Faculty of Law and Management.</p>
<p>Dr Brash says he is delighted at the appointment.</p>
<p>&quot;I am particularly pleased to have been made an Adjunct Professor at the AUT Business School,&quot; says Dr Brash. &quot;Not least because I have been associated with the university since the days when it was still the Auckland Technical Institute. At that time, I was a founding member of the ATI Foundation.&quot;</p>
