<p>MEDIA STATEMENT</p>
<p>Hon Judith Tizard</p>
<p>Member of Parliament for Auckland Central</p>
<p>New Zealand Labour Party</p>
<p>5 October 2008</p>
<p>Tizard campaign for Auckland Central launched today</p>
<p>Labour Party candidate and current Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard launched her candidacy for the Auckland Central electorate at Caluzzi Café and Bar in Newton today.</p>
<p>Judith marked the day by launching her campaign website <a href="http://www.tizard.org.nz">www.tizard.org.nz</a></p>
<p>The MP said that as a life-long Aucklander and MP for Auckland Central since 1996, she knew that Auckland is and must continue to be a great place to live and work.</p>
<p>&quot;As a New Zealander I know Auckland needs to be a high performing international hub with great infrastructure and amenities,&quot; said the Labour Party candidate for 2008.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ve made huge progress under Labour-led governments but we still have a long way to go. We’ve built roads and public transport but there’s more of that to come plus effective broadband and a really robust power supply as well.”</p>
<p>“We’ve provided more employment and better health, education and training for all New Zealanders and safer, better funded communities for families to prosper in,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Judith noted that there was a need to keep the pressure on funders and providers of services, so that the city can continue to be a great place to live and work in as Auckland grows.</p>
<p>&quot;As the inner city grows we need places for active and passive recreation; where Aucklanders and visitors can walk, run, listen and play. We need parks, Eden Park remodeled for the Rugby World Cup, the Art Gallery and new theatres. We need to see the city working - for us and for New Zealand,” said Judith Tizard.</p>

<p>Judith Tizard&#39;s experience in local and central government means she&#39;s made a real difference to Auckland Central, she’s worked with everyone across the region and she knows what needs to be done for the future.</p>
<p>Judith will be campaigning on the following issues: Safe, connected communities; Improved public transport and roading; Ensuring people-focused development and re-development; Continuing improvements in air and water quality; Improving the levels of open access to education and health services; and Providing affordable mixed housing.</p>
<p>&quot;I am committed to keeping local and central government accountable and making sure they deliver the things we need,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Judith concluded her campaign launch with a pledge to go keep effecting positive change in the Auckland Central Electorate.</p>
<p>She said only a Labour-led government could be trusted to deliver the things New Zealand families held dear.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether its cheaper doctors visits, support through Working for Families, interest free students loans, 20 hours free early childhood education, KiwiSaver, Kiwi Bank, continuing to increase the minimum wage or free off-peak access to public transport for seniors, only Labour can be trusted to protect these things in these uncertain economic times,&quot; said Judith Tizard.</p>
<p>Michael Wallmannsberger, Chairman of the Auckland Central Labour Party said that Judith Tizard has done more for Auckland than most of her predecessors put together, because she understood that she needed to work across Auckland issues while staying in touch with her constituents.</p>
<p>“She’s a great local MP as well as an effective Minister who has been able to work with anyone and everyone for Auckland Central. She’s also been great to work with as she knows how to have fun as well as how to work hard” he said.</p>
