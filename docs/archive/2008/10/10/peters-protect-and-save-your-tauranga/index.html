<p><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters – Campaign Address 12.30pm Friday 10th October 2008, from the back of a truck, Red Square, Tauranga</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>“Protect and Save YOUR Tauranga”</em></strong></p>
<p>In four weeks the day that you have been waiting for will arrive.</p>
<p>On that day you will exercise your right to select the government of your choice.</p>
<p>This election in Tauranga is a two horse race.</p>
<p>One who’s never been to the track - and one who’s won a stack of group one races.</p>
<p>Politics is about action. There are plenty of people who make a lot of noise and use up their energy but only a few get the job done.</p>
<p>Let’s look at Tauranga and ask ourselves who has been the REAL Member of Parliament for this electorate for the past three years?</p>
<p>Tauranga is a special place. It is the fastest growing and most dynamic city in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Three years ago Tauranga and the Mount had received the biggest roading, schooling and hospital investment of any provincial city in New Zealand.</p>
<p>On roading - it is the envy of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch in particular.</p>
<p>Tauranga in 2005 got an elected representative who did a lot of talking and nothing else – and another who kept getting things done. Like a new harbour bridge.</p>
<p>Despite the 2005 result locally, New Zealand First got the new harbour bridge being built now, toll free.</p>
<p>Only one party has delivered for Tauranga over the past three years.</p>
<p>Only one party secured a toll free harbour bridge – saving the citizens and business of this region hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

<p>Over the past three years we have acted in your best interests in numerous ways.</p>
<p>We have:</p>
<p>• Secured a reduction in business tax to 30% and Export Year.</p>
<p>• Increased the minimum wage to twelve dollars an hour.</p>
<p>• Increased superannuation by over $70 a week for married couples and $40 for singles.</p>
<p>• Put more than half a billion dollars extra into eldercare.</p>
<p>• Introduced the SuperGold Card with free off-peak travel on public transport.</p>
<p>• Gained higher subsidies for hearing aids.</p>
<p>• We slowed Labour’s politically correct social engineering agenda.</p>
<p>• We provided 1000 more frontline police staff and 250 support staff to make your communities safer.</p>
<p>The people of Tauranga know how critical law and order is.</p>
<p>Many of you have become victims in your own homes after years of &quot;soft on crime&quot; polices from the two old parties.</p>
<p>Tauranga is one of New Zealand’s critical gateways to the world.</p>
<p>It drives exports and using the tax system to put the right incentives in place for business is critical to this area.</p>
<p>Now we could go on – but there is one thing that is clear when it comes to New Zealand First.</p>
<p>We deliver.</p>
<p>Let’s turn now to the next three years.</p>
<p>We will increase Superannuation to 68% of the Net Average Wage for married couples, with similar adjustments for single people.</p>
<p>We also want to change the rebate level for those who are non-qualified spouses to bring it into line with the widows’ benefit and raise the rebate from $80 to $100 and ensure it is indexed to the CPI.</p>
<p>And we must deal with the issue of overseas pensions once and for all.</p>
<p>While we secured a review of these and some minor changes, the reality is that the only fair and equitable solution is a 1 in 45 year formula, based on years resident in each jurisdiction.</p>
<p>We believe the SuperGold Card can be even better.</p>
<p>We will introduce a power subsidy of $300 per household with a SuperGold Card over the winter months.</p>
<p>While we secured much needed funding into the eldercare sector, there is still much more that needs to be done on this front.</p>
<p>We are the party that believes in a universal student allowance.</p>
<p>Many of you must be concerned about the crisis in the global financial sector.</p>
<p>We have a plan to address it.</p>
<p>We are going to set up a New Zealand Fund to buy back strategic assets flogged off to foreign interests.</p>
<p>This ensures that New Zealand investors keep their money and their profits right here.</p>
<p>We will protect your investments and savings by providing a government guarantee to banks like Kiwibank and the Taranaki Savings Bank.</p>
<p>We’re going to guarantee deposits up to $100,000 in these New Zealand owned banks.</p>
<p>And we are going to target interest rates.</p>
<p>There’s no excuse for interest rates to be more than twice the inflation rate, and credit card rates over six times the inflation rate.</p>
<p>It is imported foreign financial garbage masquerading as so-called market forces.</p>
<p>New Zealand First is going to use the state’s credit and loan facilities to drive down interest rates.</p>
<p>We will change the Reserve Bank Act to protect and save this country from two clear and present evils.</p>
<p>First, the most volatile currency in the world.</p>
<p>Second, some of the highest interest rates in the OECD with little if any relationship to risk.</p>
<p>This crude and clumsy legislation is destroying peoples’ equity in their homes and thereby a huge chunk of their savings.</p>
<p>Why should a $300,000 home be now worth $200,000 – just because the Reserve Bank says so?</p>
<p>This is an unnecessary attack on the home owners’ investment and savings.</p>
<p>Whilst the two old parties argue about the rats and mice of tax cuts of ten to fifteen dollars, let’s get real here.</p>
<p>People are losing hundreds of thousands of dollars on their homes whilst Mr Key talks about peanuts for tax cuts.</p>
<p>And you can bet one thing. John Key won’t do anything about the Reserve Bank Act. Bill English has said so.</p>
<p>We will and in doing so save home owners well over one hundred dollars a week in mortgage costs.</p>
<p>We will stop foreign owned banks creaming off over $4 billion a year in profits.</p>
<p>New Zealand owned banks with Government support can cut both mortgage and credit rates to save families, and New Zealand First intends to do just that.</p>
<p>We have seen what greed can do to international financial markets and to ours back home as well.</p>
<p>And whilst we are at it, why are government and local body accounts with foreign banks, so they can clip the ticket on every transaction?</p>
<p>Those accounts should be in a New Zealand owned bank where our economy gets the profits.</p>
<p>New Zealanders are being screwed by foreign owned banks and finance dealers. We will send them a message. We’ve had enough.</p>
<p>We are going to protect your homes and your streets by banning gangs and mounting a war against crime.</p>
<p>For those who want to break the crime habit we will help them with rehabilitation programmes.</p>
<p>The legislation is ready, we have the extra police and they will get whatever powers are needed to put the criminals away - until they are too old to be a nuisance.</p>
<p>Now you might ask me “what are you going to do to for Tauranga in future?”</p>
<p>Besides protecting and saving your home and your community, we’re going to get on with further construction.</p>
<p>Why would you have 16 sets of traffic lights when a tunnel at Hairini makes more sense?</p>
<p>So it is clear that Tauranga doesn’t need any more “bridges” – just a tunnel and an MP who gets things done.</p>
<p>I got you two bridges, you don’t need any more bridges.</p>
<p>With all the extra police – 102 in this region – it is clear that this region needs a seriously upgraded police station.</p>
<p>This is an investment – not a cost.</p>
<p>Standing here on the back of a truck reminds me of another election campaign here back in 1990.</p>
<p>Three years after the share market crash of 87 a new National government came into power and started the worst slash and burn exercise since the great depression of the thirties.</p>
<p>New Zealand First was created from the wreckage of that secret political agenda that was even worse than Labour’s economic and social revolution of the eighties.</p>
<p>My job as National MP for Tauranga was supposed to be carrying a suitcase of broken promises from Wellington to tell you that they were broken for economic reasons that would benefit you in the long term.</p>
<p>In other words, National wanted me as their bad news message boy and when I said “forget it, my responsibility is to the people of Tauranga” they kicked me out of the caucus.</p>
<p>So, we set up New Zealand First, and worked to repair the damage that had been done.</p>
<p>In 2008, National wants another message boy in Tauranga.</p>
<p>Someone to come back here and tell you that a former foreign exchange speculator has decided that people receiving income under $40,000 don’t deserve any more.</p>
<p>A National led government (heaven forbid) would be terrified at the thought of facing a political street fighter in this electorate.</p>
<p>They would wonder what hit them.</p>
<p>There is no way we would tolerate senior citizens ever being targeted again like they were in the nineties.</p>
<p>Remember the superannuation surcharge?</p>
<p>Remember the cut in superannuation – when National’s deputy leader Bill English was Treasurer?</p>
<p>Remember the strategic asset sales?</p>
<p>This election is about your survival over the next three years.</p>
<p>It is not a time for nervous nellies or inexperience or secret agendas.</p>
<p>It is time to keep our priorities and to be fair to all our citizens and to use our assets like any wise business person.</p>
<p>We must steer our own ship through the stormy seas ahead and look after our own first.</p>
<p>New Zealand First is a small party but remember that it is not the size of the dog in a fight that counts – it is the size of the fight in the dog.</p>
<p>It’s going to be a hard road but we can reach our destination safely if we travel together and fight off the challenges on the way.</p>
<p>There’s an old saying that “when the going gets tough the tough get going” and that’s why you need a tough leader.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
