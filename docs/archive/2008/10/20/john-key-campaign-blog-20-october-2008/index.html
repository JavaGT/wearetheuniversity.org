<p>John Key: Key Notes</p>
<p>Campaign blog: 20 October 2008</p>
<p>I started this weekend getting my hands dirty on Saturday morning taking part in a makeover at Tamaki Primary School (YouTube video at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yl7FEgS2rI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yl7FEgS2rI</a>).</p>
<p>It was good to get some exercise, given that the time pressures of an intense election campaign do not allow me much time to get any exercise.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon I went to a colourful Diwali celebration at the Viaduct Harbour.</p>
<p>The Indian community were out in force and I got a great reception. Helen Clark, John Banks and myself were all presented with hats to wear - pictures of which made their way into at least one Sunday newspaper yesterday.</p>
<p>Then yesterday I flew to Nelson for a family BBQ day out. It was a chance for families to enjoy the fine weather and entertainment put on by local National MP Nick Smith.</p>
<p>There was children&#39;s face painting (including &quot;JK08&quot;!) and a sausage sizzle raising money for the local hospice. A few weeks ago I announced extra funding for hospices, which do a vital job for communities.</p>
<p>After the Nelson visit, I flew to Wellington for a press conference in the National Party Caucus room at Parliament about the situation with our banking system. <a href="http://national.org.nz/Article.aspx?articleId=28772">http://national.org.nz/Article.aspx?articleId=28772</a></p>
<p>I announced our intention to approach the issue of wholesale banking deposit guarantees in a constructive and bipartisan way with the current Government.</p>
<p>We should be moving towards such a guarantee given that we do not want to risk seeing banks having to tighten credit in New Zealand.</p>
