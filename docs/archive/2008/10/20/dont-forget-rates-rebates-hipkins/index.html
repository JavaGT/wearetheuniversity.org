<p><strong>Monday, 20 October 2008, 4:53 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Don’t forget Rates Rebates - Hipkins</p>
<p>Thousands of Hutt Valley families who are eligible for a Rates Rebate haven’t yet applied according to Labour’s candidate for the Rimutaka electorate Chris Hipkins.</p>
<p>“At a time when our local households are under considerable financial pressure, the Rates Rebate scheme offers some much needed financial relief,” Chris Hipkins said.</p>
<p>Those with an income under $21,180 are eligible for a Rates Rebate of up to $530.</p>
<p>Latest figures show that only 732 Upper Hutt households have applied out of an estimated 1,923 households who are eligible.</p>
<p>The uptake in Lower Hutt is even lower with just 513 out of an estimated 4,083 eligible households making applications.</p>
<p>&quot;The rates rebate scheme is another great example of how the Labour-led government is targeting additional assistance to those most in need,” Chris Hipkins said.</p>
<p>“Rates rebates are available to those on low incomes and are particularly beneficial to those who have retired.</p>
<p>Significant increases in the maximum rebate and the number of people who are eligible came into effect on the 1st of July 2006.</p>
<p>&quot;I would encourage all those who think they may be eligible for a rates rebate and haven&#39;t yet applied to check with the local council,&quot; Chris Hipkins said.</p>
<p>Application forms are available from local councils and on the rates rebates website: <a href="http://www.ratesrebates.govt.nz">www.ratesrebates.govt.nz</a>.</p>
