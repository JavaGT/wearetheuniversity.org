<p>Good Response To Lincoln University Industry Focused Scholarships</p>
<p>Lincoln University is steadily fielding enquiries about its Lincoln University Industry Focused Scholarship Programme, which was launched in September 2008.</p>
<p>Lincoln University Vice-Chancellor Roger Field says even though the interest has been encouraging so far, they still want more responses.</p>
<p>The window for students to submit their applications is now at the halfway point. Roger Field says it is important that prospective students get their applications in early.</p>
<p>“It is our experience that students often leave it to the last minute to submit their applications. We have tried to make the application process as easy as possible for students. The forms are simple to fill out and can easily be downloaded from our website,” he says.</p>
<p>The Lincoln University Industry Focused Scholarship Programme is for intelligent and motivated young people who are likely to be from urban areas, and where the University doesn’t traditionally attract students from.</p>
<p>“We work closely with industry to produce highly educated students and we have an excellent record of graduate employment. Our programmes provide graduates with specific career outcomes. For example, our food, environment and land related commerce degrees prepare students for employment in defined areas that are experiencing good growth.</p>
<p>“We see it as our responsibility as a land based teaching and research institution to encourage young New Zealanders to explore career opportunities within these industries and consider them as a real option. Many students don’t realise that land based sectors can also be an option for those living in urban centres. We look forward to reviewing the applications as they come in and will follow the progress of scholarship winners closely,” says Roger Field.</p>
<p>The Lincoln University Industry Focused Scholarship Programme is an expansion of its current scholarship programme. It offers 200 new undergraduate scholarships valued at $4,500 each and is for first-year students to support demand by key industries.</p>
<p>The scholarships will be offered across nine key Bachelor’s programmes where industry has indicated there are capability shortages.</p>
<p>Applications for the Lincoln University Industry Focused Scholarships are open from 26 September to 10 November 2008. Potential students should apply online at <a href="http://www.lincolnscholarships.co.nz">www.lincolnscholarships.co.nz</a> or talk to their careers advisor.</p>
