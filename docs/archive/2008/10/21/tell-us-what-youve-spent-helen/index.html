<p>Bill English MP National Party Finance Spokesman</p>
<p>21 October 2008</p>
<p>Tell us what you&#39;ve spent, Helen</p>
<p>National Party Finance spokesman Bill English says Helen Clark should say how much she&#39;s booked against future budgets for the spending promises she has already made in this year&#39;s election campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite knowing for much longer than National how bad the books were, Helen Clark has made substantial promises already this campaign - many uncosted.</p>
<p>&quot;Having realised the public were seeing through her &#39;put it on tick&#39; approach to the election, Helen Clark is now saying she&#39;s not spending any more.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is that she hasn&#39;t told us what she&#39;s already spent or what she&#39;s booked against future budgets. Nor has Labour provided any forecasts about how this would impact on debt and the deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;Last week&#39;s low-key promise to maintain the floor of super at 66% of the average after-tax wage was not calculated in the Treasury forecasts.</p>
<p>&quot;Also missing was the billion-dollar insulation fund, the ETS compensation payment to households, the student allowance announcement, increasing the weekly earnings threshold for beneficiaries, the introduction of a new retraining allowance, and the purchase of St James Station.</p>
<p>&quot;The last time Labour booked up spending like this, they cancelled the tax cuts that they&#39;d promised before the election.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr English says National released a fully costed package which includes the commitment to maintain super at 66%, and clearly indicated that choices were required to help get the economy growing again and deliver some security to hard-working Kiwis.</p>
<p>&quot;Helen Clark has already promised up large, and now she&#39;s trying to pretend to be responsible. It&#39;s time for her to demonstrate how responsible she is, by telling Michael Cullen to put the facts in front of the public before, not after, the election.&quot;</p>
