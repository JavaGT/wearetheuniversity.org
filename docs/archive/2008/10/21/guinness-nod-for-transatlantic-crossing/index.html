<p>Guinness nod for transatlantic crossing</p>
<p>A senior tutor at The University of Auckland&#39;s Faculty of Education is officially a Guinness world record breaker.</p>
<p>Tara Remington, who teaches Health and Physical Education, now holds the record for fastest all-women Atlantic crossing, east to west, with a four person crew.</p>
<p>Tara was part of an international crew to cross the Atlantic in 51 days in January this year, crushing the previous record by 17 days, but she only received the official rubber stamp from Guinness last week.</p>
<p>&quot;I have the certificate up on my wall,&quot; Tara, who teaches PE in the University&#39;s BEd(Tchg), says proudly.</p>
<p>&quot;The race fundamentally changed me as a person. When you&#39;ve been in a life and death situation like that you find it very hard to get rattled on land. I have a keen sense of adventure and I hope I pass that on in my teaching.&quot;</p>
<p>The race was Tara&#39;s second transatlantic crossing attempt. In 2005, she rowed in a mixed pair with fellow kiwi Iain Rudkin, battling chronic seasickness, sharks and hurricanes before a capsize and dramatic rescue ended their attempt 46 days in.</p>
<p>&quot;This race was a completely different beast. There wasn&#39;t as much drama, but I did have to endure a week of seasickness - I just watched my whole body deteriorate before I got my sea legs,&quot; Tara says.</p>
<p>Tara&#39;s crewmates aboard &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; included two Brits and one American, who in pairs rowed for two hours, then slept for two hours, for the entire crossing.</p>
<p>&quot;I had never rowed in a women&#39;s four before. You&#39;re never alone, there&#39;s no privacy, and the shape of the boat means the waves constantly soak you, so you&#39;re wet all the time, but we all coped incredibly well,&quot; Tara says.</p>

<p>&quot;You have to be so patient. Sometimes it&#39;s really slow going but we kept ourselves sane by playing eye-spy and, when we had power, listening to our Ipods.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s an incredible experience. Now that I&#39;ve done it I&#39;ll spend the rest of my life looking for another experience to match it.&quot;</p>
<p>Born in the United States, Tara now represents New Zealand where she has lived for 12 years. Like her world record attempt, Tara says teaching is equally life changing and the challenges and achievements found in the classroom are as exciting to her as crossing the Atlantic.</p>
