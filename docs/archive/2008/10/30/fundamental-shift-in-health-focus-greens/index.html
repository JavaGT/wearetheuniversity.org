<p>Fundamental shift in health focus: Greens</p>
<p>The Green Party&#39;s Preventative Health Strategy was launched at Wellington Hospital today with Health Spokesperson Sue Kedgley calling for a dramatic change in how New Zealand approaches health.</p>
<p>&quot;We need a fundamental shift in our health system to focus on prevention and keeping people well. We need to move away from a system that deals only with people who are unwell rather than the root causes of ill health - such as poor diets, poverty, cold and damp houses.&quot;</p>
<p>At least $3 billion is currently spent on treating preventable illnesses and this places a massive burden on our health system, in addition to causing unnecessary suffering and harm to the people and families affected, Ms Kedgley says.</p>
<p>&quot;The reality is that our hospitals are clogged with people who are suffering from preventable illnesses, whether it&#39;s the 13,000 New Zealanders who were hospitalised with skin infections last year or the thousands of New Zealanders who suffer from chronic dietary-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes, at a cost to the health system of $600 million per year.&quot;</p>
<p>The economic and social cost of preventable illness is huge and needs to be addressed right now, Ms Kedgley says.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s why our priority is health prevention, and we want to see a progressive increase in funding for preventative health to at least 10 percent of the health budget.</p>
<p>&quot;If we don&#39;t increase our spending on preventative health and reduce the number of people ending up in hospital, our healthcare system will remain in crisis, and health expenditure will continue to skyrocket,&quot; Ms Kedgley says.</p>
<p>The Green Party&#39;s strategy has a raft of initiatives to promote people&#39;s health that include:</p>
<p>* Free annual wellness checks for all New Zealanders and extensive checks at key life stages<br>* Improving access to free dental care for young people<br>* A levy on soft drinks to pay for increased dental services for young people<br>* Insulate all cold, damp homes in New Zealand<br>* Raise real incomes including the minimum wage to $15<br>* Speed up the state house building programme to provide more quality, sustainable low income housing<br>* Get rid of ads for unhealthy food before 8.30pm at night, teach gardening and cooking in all primary schools, and introduce a traffic light labelling system on food<br>* Increase investment in diabetes prevention<br>* Promote drug-free lifestyles in schools and education on risks of cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco</p>
<p>* Preventable health costings are attached and the policy is available at weblink: <a href="http://www.greens.org.nz/health/preventative">http://www.greens.org.nz/health/preventative</a></p>
