<p><strong>Thursday, 30 October 2008, 2:30 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Workers_Party_of_New_Zealand">Workers Party of New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Workers Party media release</p>
<p>Academics and Unionists support Paul Hopkinson</p>
<p>Over 30 prominent academics, teachers and trade unionists have signed an open letter in support of suspended school teacher Paul Hopkinson, standing as the Workers Party candidate for Christchurch East in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>Despite campaigning only in his own time (weekends and school holidays), Mr Hopkinson was told that due to a provision of the 1993 Electoral Act concerning the political activities of public servants he would have to take unpaid leave for the three weeks leading up to the 2008 general election.</p>
<p>Mr Hopkinson considered this an undemocratic restriction on his participation in the political process, as having a partner and two children to support and not having any other financial resources to fall back on he simply cannot afford to take unpaid leave. He also felt that it places small minor parties like the Workers Party at a disadvantage, as unlike the major parties Labour and National they cannot afford to pay their candidates&#39; wages for the duration of the election campaign.</p>
<p>After refusing to take unpaid leave, Mr Hopkinson has become the first teacher in New Zealand to be suspended without pay by his employer.</p>
<p>Below is the open letter in support of Hopkinson and list of signatories. This document is also available online at <a href="http://workersrightostand.blogspot.com/">http://workersrightostand.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>Open Letter and Sign-on Statement: No to restrictions on workers&#39; freedom of political speech and activity!</p>

<p>Schoolteacher and Workers Party Christchurch East candidate Paul Hopkinson has been suspended without pay by his employer until after the upcoming election for refusing to comply with the fundamentally anti-democratic provisions of the 1993 Electoral Act.</p>
<p>This Act stipulates that all public servants (including teachers) must take unpaid leave for the three weeks between nomination day and polling day, effectively ensuring that only those who are on senior management-level salaries or enjoy the backing of one of the major parties such as Labour or National can afford to stand in elections.</p>
<p>We the undersigned believe that this constitutes a violation of workers&#39; fundamental rights to freedom of political speech and activity and demand that this undemocratic law be scrapped.</p>
