<p>PRESS RELEASE 31 October 2008</p>
<p>ACT Candidate Promises Real And Practical Support For Blue Chip Victims</p>
<p>ACT Candidate for Tauranga, Ron Scott, last night promised victims of Blue Chip and other financial collapses some hope at a candidates meeting in Tauranga last night.</p>
<p>ACT will retain and independent, well resourced Serious Fraud Office. And ACT will ensure that the law is backed up with an effective justice system.</p>
<p>The meeting hosted by EUFA was attended by most of the candidates. Missing in action was Winston Peters who has recently been campaigning on Blue Chip.</p>
<p>“Here is a man who has been grandstanding about Blue Chip during the week and can’t be bothered to face up to the victims of his nutty policy to get rid of the Serious Fraud Office” said Mr Scott.</p>
<p>“Mr Peters has this personal vendetta against Clarkson and the SFO and he is letting that get in the way of helping the very people he pretends to support”.</p>
<p>• An independent SFO is important so that the Office acts without fear or favour. We saw the importance of such an arrangement when the Auditor general came down on politicians a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>• A well resources SFO is vital so that they can afford to hire brains which can outsmart the tricky scamsters.</p>
<p>• An effective Court system is important so that those responsible for wrecking the lives of tens of thousands of New Zealanders face Justice and are made to pay retribution.</p>
<p>Act has a policy to introduce night courts in order to speed up the justice system.</p>
<p>ACT will rescind the decision by the current Labour/NZ First Government to disband the SFO.</p>
