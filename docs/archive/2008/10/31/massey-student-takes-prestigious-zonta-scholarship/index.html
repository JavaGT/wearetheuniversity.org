<p>Massey student takes prestigious Zonta scholarship</p>
<p>Fourth-year business and science student Genevieve Cooper is the recipient of this year’s Zonta International Jane M Klausman Women in Business Scholarship.</p>
<p>The scholarship, first awarded in 1998, is open to women worldwide who are pursuing an undergraduate degree in business leading to a business management career. The $9226 ($US5000) scholarship is awarded to students of outstanding achievement and future potential in their third or fourth year of undergraduate study. To be considered for the award, applicants must be successful in winning one of 16 national Zonta awards – Ms Cooper received the New Zealand (District 16) Zonta scholarship worth $2000 earlier his month.</p>
<p>Ms Cooper, from Wanganui, is studying a conjoint Bachelor of Business Studies/Bachelor of Science degree, which she will complete at the Manawatu campus this year. Her programme of study has been finance and statistics–focused, with the goal of a career in the investment banking industry where her corporate finance and statistical skills can be applied to improve the quality of financial modelling and corporate decision making. She says she was “absolutely delighted” to receive the scholarship, which she will use for postgraduate or work-related study.</p>
<p>Ms Cooper received the district Zonta award on 22 October at Wharerata. The international scholarship will be presented in Wanganui at 6pm on 18 November at The Kingsgate Avenue Hotel.</p>
<p>The Jane M Klausman scholarship was established in 1998 as a result of a generous bequest left by Jane Klausman, a Zonta member from New York. Ms Klausman recognised the significant barriers to achievement that exist for women in the business world and wished to support young women anywhere in the world seeking a business career. The scholarship is prestigious and remains the only scholarship provided by Zonta International on a global basis for undergraduate students. Since 1998, Zonta has awarded 175 scholarships to women in 39 countries.</p>
<p>Applications for the 2009 Zonta Scholarships open in January 2009. More information and applications forms are available from Zonta Clubs <a href="http://www.zonta.org.nz">www.zonta.org.nz</a>, or from Massey University scholarship officers.</p>
