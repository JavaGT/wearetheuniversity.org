<p>Ignore our Young at your peril says Maori Party</p>
<p>Te Ururoa Flavell, MP for Waiariki</p>
<p>Friday 24 October 2008</p>
<p>The Maori Party is calling on all political parties to lift their game in respects of young New Zealanders.</p>
<p>&quot;Every party should be concerned that 22% of 18 -to-24 year olds may miss out on the opportunity to vote&quot; says Maori Party MP for Waiariki, Te Ururoa Flavell.</p>
<p>The Electoral Enrolment Centre recently announced that 89,000 potential voters in this age group have still not enrolled.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s one in five of our young people who are at risk of being left behind this election&quot; said Flavell.</p>
<p>&quot;This caps off a bad week in terms of the nation&#39;s performance in responding to the needs of our youth&quot; said Flavell.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re challenging every party this election to &#39; rock the vote &#39; - to lift the vote for our rangatahi - and to carry that same commitment to our young people into the next Government, to uphold the fortunes of those who carry the hopes and dreams for our future&quot;.</p>
<p>* Deterioration in Relative Incomes</p>
<p>This week the OECD report, &#39;Growing Unequal: Income distribution and poverty in OECD countries&#39; revealed that New Zealand was in a group of only six nations where youths aged 18 to 25 years had recorded a much larger deterioration in relative incomes of around 10 points or more (the other countries were Denmark, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, Turkey).</p>
<p>* Youth Unemployment Rates</p>
<p>Maori and Pacific youth unemployment rates at 22.5% for Maori youth and 20.7% for Pasifika youth; remain well above that of European youth (11.7%). (Household Labour Force Survey; youth defined as 15-19 years)</p>
<p>* Declining Completion rates - Tertiary education</p>
<p>In another report, Education at a Glance: OECD Indicators 2008, we learnt that in 2005, more than 46% of students who entered tertiary programmes in New Zealand left without tertiary qualifications, which is far higher than the OECD average of 31%.</p>
<p>The report describes shows the proportion of students who enter a tertiary programme and leave without at least a first tertiary degree.</p>
