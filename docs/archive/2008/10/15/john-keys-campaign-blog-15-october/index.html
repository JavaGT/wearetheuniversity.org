<p>Campaign Blog - 15 October</p>
<p><strong>15 October</strong></p>
<p>On the campaign trail in Auckland yesterday <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin//emstracking/131-5351.link">I revealed the measures National will take</a> to provide a better standard of care to pregnant women, new mothers and their babies.</p>
<p>I believe Labour hasn&#39;t done a good job over the last nine years with maternity care, which is in something of a crisis.</p>
<p>I want to see better maternity services that give safe and high-quality care to pregnant women, young mothers, and their babies.</p>
<p>We not only have to make the most of existing resources, but we also have to invest more, which is what our policy proposes.</p>
<p>One of the most important things we can do is provide some more funding so mothers are not forced to go home a few hours after birth.</p>
<p>This is a particularly important time for mothers, their newborn children, and their families, and new mothers shouldn&#39;t have to feel forced into going home before they are ready.</p>
<p>We will also ensure that every new mother and baby will have weekly contact with a health professional for the first nine weeks after birth.</p>
<p>Something I was particularly proud to announce yesterday was our commitment to reversing Labour&#39;s cancelled funding of PlunketLine.</p>
<p>This means that parents will now have access to a 24-hour Plunket service.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve also recognised the workforce crisis in midwifery with our plan to offer a <a href="http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin//emstracking/131-5352.link">voluntary bonding scheme</a>. This will mean that new midwives who agree to work in hard-to-staff areas for three to five years after graduation get student loan writeoffs.</p>
<p>We believe that this will help improve the dire staffing situation in some areas.</p>
