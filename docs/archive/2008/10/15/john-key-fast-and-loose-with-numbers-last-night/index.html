<p><strong>Wednesday, 15 October 2008, 12:30 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Hon Dr Michael Cullen<br>Labour Party Deputy Leader<br>Finance Spokesperson</p>
<p>15 October 2008 Media Statement<br>John Key – fast and loose with numbers last night</p>
<p>John Key was playing fast and loose with the facts in last night&#39;s television debate, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.</p>
<p>&quot;On KiwiSaver, John Key was dishonest in pretending that under National&#39;s proposals employers won&#39;t be able to pass on the cost of the employer contribution to the employee.</p>
<p>That is precisely what was happening before Labour changed the law that National is now promising to repeal.</p>
<p>&quot;That would mean an employee on the average full-time wage in KiwiSaver would be nearly $40 a week worse off under National.</p>
<p>&quot;Second, Mr Key was dishonest in suggesting low income families would get National&#39;s complicated Earner Rebate. He knows that is not true.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, low income families would be worse off under National&#39;s proposals up to a level of over $40,000 a year.</p>
<p>&quot;Third, Mr Key was dishonest in suggesting that a family on $40,000 benefitting from Working for Families would lose two thirds of any extra dollar earned under Labour, but only one third under National.</p>
<p>&quot;At present the effective marginal tax rate for such a family is 53 per cent. That falls to 41 per cent under Labour&#39;s legislated for tax policies versus 40 per cent under National&#39;s. But so far, no other Parliamentary party has expressed support for National&#39;s proposals.</p>
<p>&quot;Fourth, Mr Key claimed that the top tax rate in Australia cuts in at &#39;hundreds of thousands of dollars&#39; above New Zealand&#39;s.</p>

<p>&quot;In fact, the top tax rate of 45 per cent cuts in at $A180,001, but their second top rate of 40 per cent is still higher than NZ&#39;s top rate, and it cuts in $A80,001. In any case, under National&#39;s policy, the top rate would cut in at ten thousand dollars less than Labour&#39;s legislated for tax cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;Finally, for Mr Key to suggest that because he headed Merrill Lynch&#39;s foreign exchange division then that fits him to be Prime Minister in the current financial crisis – that is a little like Sweeney Todd claiming the right to be the right person to regulate the hairdressing industry.&quot;</p>
