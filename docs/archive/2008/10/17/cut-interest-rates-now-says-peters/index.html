<p>Cut Interest Rates Now Says Peters</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank should cut interest rates dramatically to prevent serious social effects from the country falling into a deep slump, says New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.</p>
<p>Mr Peters said that the bank is sitting on its hands while companies collapse, jobs are lost and the equity disappears from family homes.</p>
<p>“Other countries are slashing interest rates and doing everything they can to stay afloat while in New Zealand the Reserve Bank is taking a finger in the wind approach.</p>
<p>“The Reserve Bank must not operate at the pace of a slow-moving snail. It must cut the OCR by at least one and a half percentage points now to halt the slide or there will be massive financial fallout over the next few months.</p>
<p>“There are thousands of small business owners in the country who have put their homes and businesses on the line and the Reserve Bank is blatantly ignoring their plight.</p>
<p>“The jobs of thousands of other New Zealanders are also at stake here while highly paid Reserve Bank officials gaze into computer screens.</p>
<p>“It&#39;s time for action – not dreaming,” said Mr Peters.</p>
