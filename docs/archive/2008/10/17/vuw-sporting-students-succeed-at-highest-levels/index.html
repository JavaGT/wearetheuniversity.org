<p>Victoria&#39;s supreme athletes and administrators from a variety of sports were honoured at the 2008 Victoria University Blues Awards, held on Tuesday October 14th. </p>
<p>The Blues are the highest recognition the University can give to people who have, by their sporting achievements or contribution to sport, brought credit to the institution. They are awarded by the Victoria University of Wellington Students&#39; Association on the recommendation of the Blues Panel, which consists of the representatives of the Victoria University Sports Council and two appointed members, both of which are highly respected in the Wellington sports industry. </p>
<p>There were three finalists for Sportsperson of the Year including Victor Vito for achievements in rugby, Chris Bishop for achievements in debating, and Natasha Hind for achievements in swimming and surf lifesaving. The award going to Natasha Hind. Natasha is a dual international for NZ in both swimming and surf lifesaving. She was a member of the NZ Olympic team to Beijing and a gold medal winner at the Oceania Champs in the 4 by 200m freestyle relay. In 2008 Natasha was named the Dominion Post Wellington Sportswoman of the Year and the Wellington Surf Life Saving High Performance athlete of the Year.</p>

<p>VUWSA President Joel Cosgrove says &quot;The high level of achievement by VUW students stands on its own merit; we have three students in very different fields succeeding at the highest level.&quot; He feels that &quot;This is a clear recognition of VUW&#39;s strength across a wide variety of codes, put alongside VUW&#39;s dominant hold on the Uni Games Shield, sport and recreation at VUW is in great health.&quot;</p>
<p>Kererua Savage was named Maori Sports Person of the Year. The former NRL player was a member of the NZU Rugby League world cup team and is captain of the Wellington provincial side. </p>
<p>Chris Bishop was named Sports Administrator of the Year. Chris is president of the VUW Debating Society which is responsible for Victoria being ranked the 19th best debating university in the world.  </p>
<p>Former Blues winners include All Blacks Graham Mourie, Jerry Collins and Conrad Smith, five times World Mountain Running Champ Jonathan Wyatt, and Black Stick Suzie Pearce. </p>
<p>The three major awards, the 2008 Sportsperson of the Year, 2008 Maori Sportsperson and 2008 Sports Administrator of the Year were presented by Barry Maister at the conclusion of the ceremony. </p>
<p>Barry is a three time Olympian highlighted by the 1976 Olympics in Montreal in which the NZ men&#39;s hockey team won gold.
