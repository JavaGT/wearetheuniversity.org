<p>Anne Tolley MP National Party Education Spokeswoman</p>

<p>Special Education announcement timing &#39;cynical&#39;</p>
<p>National Party Education spokeswoman Anne Tolley says it&#39;s hard not to be cynical about Labour&#39;s timing of a long overdue announcement for more funding for the Kapi Mana Special School in Porirua.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve visited this school and know that they have been fighting for years to get funding.</p>
<p>&quot;They have been begging the Ministry of Education for a rebuild every single year that Labour has been in power. The school was in such a dire state that in 2006 it had to be closed temporarily because maggots from dead rats were found in the ceiling.</p>
<p>&quot;No responsible Minister of Education would have left children in these appalling conditions for so long.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Tolley says John Key announced National&#39;s policy for Special Education funding on Monday. It was included in the party&#39;s package for a Crusade on Literacy and Numeracy.</p>
<p>&quot;National has committed an extra $3 million per year to expand special schools and encourage the development of satellite classes developed by them.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ve also committed an extra $18 million per year of ORRS funding to help students with the highest special needs. We&#39;ve costed this funding whereas Labour has produced no fiscals and won&#39;t until after the election.</p>
<p>&quot;Under National, Special Education won&#39;t have to wait until three weeks before an election to get some attention.&quot;</p>
