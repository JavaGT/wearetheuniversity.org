<p><strong>Friday, 17 October 2008, 9:22 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>

<p>Media Release: Young Labour - Otago University Branch<br>For Immediate Release</p>
<p>John Key Visit to Dunedin Disappointing.</p>
<p>Young Labour Otago University Branch President Ella Hardy said &quot;John Key&#39;s visit seemed only to involve meeting his National party pals; is he afraid of the public and their questions?</p>
<p>This is in stark contrast to Helen Clark&#39;s Otago University visit on Monday which was widely publicized and open to the public. 1200 students turned out to hear Helen speak, proving that students are engaged and interested in what political leaders have to say. It&#39;s sad that Key is ignorant of this and too devoid of ideas too come out of the shadows&quot;</p>
<p>Key&#39;s visit was so secretive that Young Labour members were forced to wait at the airport and follow him throughout the day. &quot;How is the average New Zealander supposed to hear Key speak, or to make an informed decision on November 8th, when he is too afraid to let people know where he will be?&quot; Ella Hardy said.</p>
<p>Young Labour activists finally managed to track Key down to his lunch spot at Café Rue where they staged a street theater sale of state assets indicating what National would do if elected to power again. Several passers-by joined the protesters who were also handing out John Key hundred dollar bills with information about the National party&#39;s flawed policies.</p>
