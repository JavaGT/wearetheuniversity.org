<p>NZEI RELEASE</p>
<p>17th October 2008</p>
<p>Crunch Meetings Ahead For School Support Staff</p>
<p>Thousands of school support staff will be attending paid union meetings over the next three weeks (Oct 20-Nov 6) to consider a pay claim to take into crucial collective agreement negotiations next year.</p>
<p>School support staff include teacher aides, librarians, office managers, ICT specialists and therapists. They are a frontline and skilled workforce but many are paid as little as $12.69 an hour.</p>
<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa represents more than 12,000 support staff and has been running a fair pay campaign to improve their pay rates, better recognise their skills and highlight problems around the bulk funding of their salaries.</p>
<p>Last month the Labour-led government promised to provide the additional funding to deliver a &quot;pay jolt&quot; to support staff to drag their pay rates out of the low pay bracket</p>
<p>&quot;This is crunch time for support staff and we need to bargain that pay jolt into reality,&quot; says NZEI President Frances Nelson. &quot;We have asked our support staff members to be patient for many years through various working parties and reviews. This time we won&#39;t be prepared to leave the bargaining table without a proper fix which recognises the vital role they play in our schools.&quot;</p>
<p>NZEI is also calling on the Education Minister to release the Report on Non-Teaching Staff Workforce which addresses some of the issues around the lack of job security for support staff due to the bulk funding of their salaries.</p>
<p>&quot;We want a process to ensure that a funding stream is available to enable principals and school boards to implement the support staff pay rates without compromising other school funding priorities,&quot; says Ms Nelson.</p>
