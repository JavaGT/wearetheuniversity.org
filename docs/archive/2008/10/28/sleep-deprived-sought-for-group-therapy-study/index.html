<p>Sleep-deprived sought for group therapy study</p>
<p>People with sleeping difficulties are being sought for a Massey University group therapy service aimed at helping insomnia sufferers.</p>
<p>The treatment targets insomnia and anxiety as these two conditions can often be linked and treatment can be more effective when both are targeted.</p>
<p>Clinical psychology student Fernanda Mottin is working with the University’s Psychology Clinic in Wellington and will examine the service as part of her Doctoral research.</p>
<p>“My research will examine the components and outcomes of the treatment by looking at the direct effects, such as improvement in sleep and reduction in anxiety symptoms, as well as the broader repercussions, such as improvement in quality of life,” she says. “Research participants will be asked to fill in an additional questionnaire and will be contacted three months after the group finishes for a follow-up assessment of about one hour.”</p>
<p>The group therapy is a paid service, as it will be delivered by a registered clinical psychologist, but there is a subsidy available for those who are also willing to take part in Ms Mottin’s research project.</p>
<p>The clinic is currently recruiting people who have longstanding difficulties with sleep – either falling asleep or staying asleep – and who might also worry too much. A free assessment is provided to determine whether a person fits the group criteria.</p>
