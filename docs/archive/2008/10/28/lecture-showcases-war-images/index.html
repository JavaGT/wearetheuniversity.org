<p><strong>Tuesday, October 28, 2008</strong><br><strong>Lecture showcases war images</strong></p>
<p>The year’s final professorial lecture from the College of Humanities and Social Sciences features Associate Professor Glyn Harper, director of the Centre for Defence Studies.</p>
<p><em>New Zealand and the First World War in (unpublished) Photographs</em> will showcase his forthcoming book <em>Images of War</em>.</p>
<p>The book collects together photographs taken by New Zealand soldiers during WWI. It will be released early next month, 90 years after the end of the war.</p>
<p>Images were initially sourced from the Queen Elizabeth II Army Memorial Museum and the Kippenberger Military Archive, but Dr Harper says thousands more photographs from private collections were sent to him after a nationwide appeal.</p>
<p>“It was a real privilege to be able to work on this project,” Dr Harper says. “As it progressed I came to realise what an important but much-neglected historical source these photographs were. I think this is one of the most important books I have worked on and I am so glad it will be released in time for the 90th commemoration of the Armistice.”</p>
<p>The lecture begins at 3.30pm on Wednesday 5 November in the Old Main Building’s auditorium at the Manawatu campus. Refreshments will be served following the lecture.</p>
