<p>Socialism key to sustainability says Workers Party candidate</p>
<p>- Workers Party media release</p>
<p>They key to creating an environmentally sustainable society is to put production in the hands of workers, says the Workers Party&#39;s Christchurch Central candidate Byron Clark.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now production is done for private profit, rather than human need, which means environmental concerns are secondary for capitalism.&quot;</p>
<p>Clark is an environmental sociology student but has little time for &quot;modern Luddites and doomsayers.&quot; He is advocating ecological modernisation as the way to deal with environmental problems. This would include such things as &#39;cradle-to-cradle&#39; style manufacturing, where products are designed and manufactured to produce minimal waste and be reintegrated into the production process at the end of their life.</p>
<p>&quot;Environmental destruction disproportionately affects the working class- both inside and outside the work place- and people in developing nations, so workers have a class interest in protecting the environment, but with no control over the means of production, the only time they get to make &#39;eco-friendly&#39; choices is at the point of consumption, and for people living on low incomes, there&#39;s really no choice at all.&quot;</p>
<p>Clark wants to see further research in science and technology, and says this would be best achieved though socialism. &quot;When I hear about the research into sequestering carbon in charcoal that&#39;s going on in Marlborough, or the latest developments in renewable energy, I always think, if even a fraction of the wealth currently expropriated by the rich was invested into this sort of research, how far could we come as a society?&quot;</p>
<p>The Workers Party is contesting the party vote this year and fielding candidates in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.</p>
