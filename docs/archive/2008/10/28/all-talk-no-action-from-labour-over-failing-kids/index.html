<p>Anne Tolley MP National Party Education Spokeswoman</p>
<p>27 October 2008</p>
<p>All talk, no action from Labour over failing kids</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s latest plan to identify at-risk kids is simply more bureaucracy and fast talk, says National&#39;s Education spokeswoman, Anne Tolley.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry of Education has already spent $700,000 on the behaviour screening tool which has been slammed by experts as a waste of money.</p>
<p>&quot;The scheme, which aims to screen all Kiwi toddlers to identify future violent offenders, is simply counting the numbers and provides no real solutions to helping our at-risk kids.</p>
<p>&quot;Teachers, social workers, and parents up and down the country are crying out for real solutions to help them identify at-risk children.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet all that Labour can do is throw hundreds of thousands of dollars at an initiative that even its own expert panel has told it to &#39;forget about&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;More bureaucracy, endless talk and number crunching will do nothing to identify and address at-risk young people like the 11-year-old Gisborne boy recently reported to be running his own gang.</p>
<p>&quot;After nine long years Labour has failed Kiwi families and schools.</p>
<p>&quot;Teachers need resources and real solutions to deal with troubled young people.</p>
<p>&quot;National will deliver these, not the bureaucracy and talk that have become Labour&#39;s hallmark.&quot;</p>
