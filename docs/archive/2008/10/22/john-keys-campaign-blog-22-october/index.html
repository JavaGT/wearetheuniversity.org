<p>Campaign Blog: 22 October</p>
<p>I had another busy day on the campaign trail yesterday in Hamilton and Auckland.</p>
<p>Following our announcement on the Waikato Expressway in Hamilton, I got out and about in Papatoetoe and Botany. The reaction was heartening.</p>
<p>Not everybody was saying they would vote National of course, but many people were, and I got a fair hearing wherever I went.</p>
<p>A particular issue raised with me consistently by people I met in both areas was law and order.</p>
<p>This is a huge concern for many members of the public I speak to, and yesterday was no exception.</p>
<p>On Monday I announced National&#39;s plan to boost frontline police numbers in south Auckland by 300. And since late last year we&#39;ve also announced policies on parole, policing tools, victims, gangs and the drug ‘P&#39;, and youth justice.</p>
<p>Like the economy, I believe law and order is one of the core issues of this election campaign. Security is top of mind for many, many people.</p>
<p>Last night I got a great reception at a public meeting organised by the party at the Pukekohe Town Hall, which was attended by more than 600 people.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there were a number of questions on law and order.</p>
<p>I will have more to say on that issue today when I visit New Plymouth to campaign there.</p>
<p>John Key</p>
