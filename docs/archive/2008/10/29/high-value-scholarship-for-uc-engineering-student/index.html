<p>High value scholarship for UC engineering student</p>
<p>University of Canterbury engineering student Jennifer Haskell has been awarded a Woolf Fisher scholarship which, at a total value of $300,000, is one of the most valuable scholarships awarded in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The three-year scholarships pay a student’s fees, provide an allowance of $35,000 a year, and cover the cost of return air travel between the UK and New Zealand once a year. They were established in 1960 by Sir Woolf Fisher (1912-1975) who co-founded Fisher and Paykel and was the first chairman of New Zealand Steel.</p>
<p>Jennifer, who is one of three students recognised in the 2008 round, will graduate from UC in April 2009 with a Bachelor of Engineering honours degree. She will move to the University of Cambridge (UK) in September 2009 to begin work on her PhD under Dr Gopal Madabhushi, a world-leading lecturer in geotechnical science.</p>
<p>Her research will focus on seismic design of foundations and utilise Cambridge&#39;s geotechnical centrifuge, a sophisticated model that can simulate the impact of earthquakes on soil.</p>
<p>An athlete as well as an engineer, Jennifer has represented New Zealand in ice and inline (roller) hockey, and hopes to play for the Cambridge women’s ice hockey team.</p>
<p>The annual Woolf Fisher scholarships are granted by the Woolf Fisher Trust. Its secretary, Dr Nigel Evans, says the calibre of applicants continues to be outstanding. </p>
<p>“All of the short-listed applicants were outstanding honours students from our top universities. The Woolf Fisher scholars are rapidly gaining a formidable reputation at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.”</p>
