<p>16 October 2008 Media Statement</p>
<p>Nats must reveal real intentions for ETS</p>
<p>It&#39;s time for National to clearly tell voters what they would do with the Emissions Trading Scheme, Labour&#39;s climate change spokesperson David Parker said today.</p>
<p>According to the Waikato Times, Nick Smith told Federated Farmers in Hamilton last night that the ETS needs to be &quot;softened&quot; for farmers.</p>
<p>&quot;Nick Smith wasn&#39;t telling the Oxfam audience on Monday night that National would be letting agriculture off the hook, but it&#39;s a different story when he&#39;s in front of an audience of farmers.</p>
<p>&quot;Climate change is too important a subject for National to remain vague about, and the public needs to know what National&#39;s real intentions are. John Key says they want to &#39;amend&#39; the present legislation, while Jacqui Dean says National would &#39;repeal&#39; it. Now Nick Smith is saying they would &#39;soften&#39; it.</p>
<p>&quot;This week National revealed it would ditch the billion-dollar household fund for energy efficiency. National had kept that little doozy from the public, until Nick Smith was forced – very reluctantly – to admit it.</p>
<p>&quot;Journalists and the public must ask the question now: what are National&#39;s real intentions for the ETS?&quot;</p>
<p>David Parker said making changes to the ETS could have enormous cost implications, and if polluters don&#39;t pay, then taxpayers will have to.</p>
<p>&quot;This sends absolutely the wrong signal to the economy. Such a move would increase the overall cost of meeting our Kyoto obligations, and increase the proportion taxpayers and some sectors have to bear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These decisions have consequences worth hundreds of millions of dollars. National&#39;s refusal to say exactly what they&#39;re planning is irresponsible given the effect on the environment and on the country&#39;s balance sheet.&quot;</p>
