<p>Anne Tolley&#39;s Newsletter</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>On Monday John Key announced National&#39;s policy to improve the literacy and numeracy skills of New Zealand&#39;s children.</p>
<p>As you will be aware, around one in five leave school without NCEA Level 1, and many don&#39;t achieve even basic reading, writing and maths skills. Raising literacy and numeracy standards will be a critical goal of the next National Government.</p>
<p>There are 10 first steps that National will take as part of its Literacy and Numeracy package. National will:</p>
<p>1. Set National Standards in literacy and numeracy.</p>
<p>2. Require every primary and intermediate school pupil to be assessed regularly against National Standards.</p>
<p>3. Require primary and intermediate schools to report to parents in plain English about how their child is doing compared to National Standards and compared to other children their age.</p>
<p>4. Provide targeted funding to assist primary and intermediate schools to give an extra hand to the pupils who aren&#39;t meeting National Standards.</p>
<p>5. Refocus the Ministry of Education and the Education Review Office on supporting schools in the Crusade for Literacy and Numeracy.</p>
<p>6. Provide additional support to underperforming schools to ensure their students are on track to achieve National Standards.</p>
<p>7. Get tough on truancy by prosecuting parents of persistent truants and giving schools extra resources to crack down on truants.</p>
<p>8. Give schools additional assistance for dealing with disruptive pupils.</p>

<p>9. Support teaching excellence by reviewing teacher training, encouraging schools to co-operate to expand successful teaching methods, celebrating the success of top-performing teachers, and supporting reductions in pupil to teacher ratios in new entrant classes.</p>
<p>10. Improve special education services by increasing ORRS funding for students with the highest special education needs, expanding special education schools, and encouraging satellite special education schools.</p>
<p>These initiatives will be funded from within the allocation for new spending in future budgets of $1.75 billion that was outlined by the Government in the PREFU, and which National has adopted in its fiscal policy.</p>
<p>National will allocate $47 million of additional funding to schools per year to aid in the literacy and numeracy crusade, including $18 million a year for targeted funding of pupils who aren&#39;t meeting National Standards.</p>
<p>Schools will have the option of using this targeted funding as they see fit. They might work with other schools to hire a specialist literacy or numeracy teacher, pay for remedial classes at a specialist provider, expand their reading recovery programme, or provide professional development to teachers in dyslexia or other specific learning difficulties that might be interfering with a child&#39;s progress towards National Standards.</p>
<p>This is a comprehensive package and I would encourage you to read the full details at: <a href="http://national.org.nz/files/2008/Education%5C_Policy%5C_Crusade%5C_for%5C_Literacy.pdf">http://national.org.nz/files/2008/Education\_Policy\_Crusade\_for\_Literacy.pdf</a></p>
