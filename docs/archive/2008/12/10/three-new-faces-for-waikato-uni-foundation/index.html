<p>Three new faces for Waikato Uni foundation</p>
<p>Hamilton businessmen Michael Crawford, Pat Peoples and Mark Donovan have been appointed as trustees to the University of Waikato Foundation.</p>
<p>Mr Crawford is the partner in charge of the Hamilton Deloitte office and the present Waikato Rugby Union chairman. Pat Peoples is a former New Zealand rower and now Schick Construction &amp; Cartage Ltd’s Managing Director and a director of Central Plant Hire Ltd. Mark Donovan is the CEO-Market for Donovan’s Chocolates and also a Waikato University alumni, having completed a two-year post graduate diploma in management studies at the Waikato Management School in 1998.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato Foundation - Te Pou Taunaki is an independent charitable trust, formed to support and fund the University of Waikato to help it take new New Zealand ideas to the world.</p>
<p>The foundation raises funds to support the strategic objectives of the university, and has recently accepted $1 million donations from ULeisure Limited and the Waikato Student Union for the university’s new $30 million Student Centre. During its last campaign the foundation raised $11 million for the Academy of Performing Arts, UniRec Centre, student scholarships and other projects.</p>
<p>Mr Donovan, Mr Peoples and Mr Crawford will be on the foundation board for up to three years as co-opted trustees. They join the university’s Chancellor, the Rt Hon Jim Bolger; the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Roy Crawford; fellow Hamilton businesspeople Terry Booth, Alastair Calder, Sharon Taylor and Ken Williamson; and Tauranga businesspeople Adrienne von Tunzelmann and John Revington. The board is chaired by Hamilton businessman John Gallagher.</p>
