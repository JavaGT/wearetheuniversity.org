<p>Relationships And Redemption</p>
<p>Scriptwriters Hannah McKie and Simon Hall have jointly won the annual David Carson-Parker Embassy Trust Prize for their stories about relationships within a Christchurch family home and a Catholic priest&#39;s journey to Africa.</p>
<p>The Master&#39;s students in the Creative Writing programme at Victoria University&#39;s International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML) received their $1,000 prizes at a function at the Embassy Theatre on Monday evening. The annual prize is awarded to the best script for a feature film written during the Master&#39;s in Creative Writing at IIML.</p>
<p>Theatre director Susan Wilson says Ms McKie&#39;s script provided a real sense of the intimacies of the McKenzie family life. &quot;The script brings wonderful credibility and grit. You can almost smell these people&quot;</p>
<p>Playwright and actor Simon O&#39;Connor, also on the judging panel, praised the play for its insight, energy and humour, and ultimately for its honest and moving portrayal of family relationships.</p>
<p>Mr Hall&#39;s feature film script tells the story of Ethan, a Catholic priest sent to Africa to investigate and discredit the miracles of a charismatic woman being celebrated as a new messiah.</p>
<p>Actor and script developer Mick Rose says Mr Hall wrote a strong script with a bold and original premise and compelling lead characters.</p>
<p>Victoria Scriptwriting Programme Director Ken Duncum says the quality of scripts in the course was so uniformly high that picking a single winner proved too difficult for the judges. &quot;Jointly awarding the prize to two writers was a more accurate reflection of the strength of the scripts across the class.&quot;</p>
<p>Funded through the Victoria University Foundation, the prize was first established by the Embassy Theatre Trust and is now funded by arts philanthropist David Carson-Parker.Â</p>
