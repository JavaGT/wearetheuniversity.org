<p>Xmas grinch tax act a sad opener for National</p>
<p>National’s kinder, gentler facade faded today as it rammed through unfair tax legislation that penalises low income families, Labour Finance Spokesperson David Cunliffe said.</p>
<p>“This Tax Act is bad for thousands of ordinary Kiwi’s, it is bad economics and was passed using bad process to ram it through before Christmas.</p>
<p>“National promised New Zealanders a brighter future but this tax package doesn’t even come close to delivering on that promise for low income earners.</p>
<p>“Anyone earning between $14,000 and $20,000 will pay 8.5 percent more tax than under Labour’s Plan. All families earning $40,000 or below and some earning up to $80,000, will also pay more tax than under Labour’s plan. But those individuals earning over $70,000 will benefit.</p>
<p>“It robs low income earners of the opportunity to save for a decent retirement by gutting Kiwisaver to the tune of $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>“Retiring should be something people look forward to not something they fear because they don’t have the savings they need to provide for themselves once they finish working.</p>
<p>“It undermines productivity, innovation and growth by stripping out 1.5 billion from the R and D tax incentive.</p>
<p>“It is the wrong way to fight recession, it rewards the few, punishes the many and wastes and opportunity for effective government economic stimulus.</p>
<p>“It was rammed through under urgency with no select committee and no opportunity for normal consultation,” Mr Cunliffe said.</p>
