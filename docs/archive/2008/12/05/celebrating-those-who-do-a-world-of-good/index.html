<p>International Volunteers Day: Celebrating those who do a world of good</p>
<p>Hon Tariana Turia; Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector</p>
<p>Thursday 4 December 2008</p>
<p>Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Tariana Turia, is encouraging New Zealanders to recognise the contributions of those who do a world of good in our communities.</p>
<p>Friday 5 December is International Volunteers Day.</p>
<p>“Right around the world, people will be stopping to take the time to say thanks” said Mrs Turia.  “Thanks for caring, for providing a second chance, for sewing the netball uniforms; for clearing the coastline of rubbish; for reorganising the library; for making dinner, for giving time to listen and help”.</p>
<p>“International Volunteer Day gives us all a nudge to recognise the volunteers and organisations who do so much in our communities” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“I am looking forward to visiting a couple of these groups in Tamaki tomorrow” said Mrs Turia.</p>
<p>“My first visit is to meet with Migrant Action Trust, an organisation involved with supporting migrants and refugees into meaningful employment”.</p>
<p>“This group is extremely active – they are involved with mentoring, voluntary work experience, support groups, career counselling, workshops and work brokering.  They also provide (ethnic-specific) parenting courses, counselling, and interactive workshops on understanding Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the Maori culture”.</p>
<p>“The other group is the Almanar Trust; an Islamic organisation catering for the large number of Muslim people living in Mount Roskill.  This group provides a whole range of services including driver’s licence courses, cultural activities, sport, weekend language and culture school for children, summer school, youth activities (camps) and the hosting of community gatherings”.</p>

<p>“Of course, we don’t need to wait till International Volunteer Day to say thanks to the thousands of individuals and organisations that hold our communities together” said Mrs Turia.  </p>
<p>“It doesn’t take much to say thanks – or for that matter to make a pledge to support those who do a world of good in our society”.</p>
<p>“This year, Volunteers Day is also National Jandal Day – if every worker in New Zealand gave a couple of dollars to Surf Life Saving, that might just help keep our beaches safe this summer”.</p>
<p>&quot;On this special day to say thanks to others, thought also might be given to taking up voluntary and community work oneself.  It can be incredibly rewarding and enriching&quot;.</p>
