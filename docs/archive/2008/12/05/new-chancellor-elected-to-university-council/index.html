<p>Friday, December 5, 2008<br>New Chancellor elected to University Council</p>
<p>Wellington company director Dr Russell Ballard has been elected to replace Nigel Gould as University Chancellor.</p>
<p>Dr Ballard, 64, a former high-ranking civil servant who headed several government departments, has a Bachelor of Agricultural Science from Massey (1967) and a Master&#39;s (1969). His PhD is in forest soils from the University of Florida (1974) and he also has a Diploma in Company Direction with distinction from Britain&#39;s Institute of Directors (2003).</p>
<p>Dr Ballard says he put his name forward because he is committed to the vision of elevating Massey to a pre-eminent position among New Zealand universities and to the top echelon of international universities. &quot;I know I share this vision with the new Vice-Chancellor and Council members and I look forward, with your support, to providing leadership in pursuit of this vision.&quot;</p>
<p>He says the fundamental building blocks to achieving the vision are: providing a superior student experience and making Massey a workplace of choice for staff.</p>
<p>&quot;Both the VC and the Council have key roles to play and I believe I have a good appreciation of the joint and separate roles of each. I am confident that I have the style, values and knowledge that will contribute to an inclusive, cohesive, energetic and productive Council operating within a robust framework of governance principles and ethical standards.&quot;</p>
<p>In 2002 Dr Ballard was one of a group of distinguished alumni to be awarded Massey&#39;s 75th Anniversary Medals. He was appointed to the Council in 2005, one of four nominees of the Minister of Education, and chairs its Performance Review Committee. He was named a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2004 Queen&#39;s Birthday Honours and is a member of the New Zealand Institute of Directors and a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Management.</p>
<p>Mr Gould, the longest serving Council member and Chancellor for the past six years, will remain on council but decided not to offer himself for re-election as Chancellor. Stephen Kos remains the University&#39;s Pro-Chancellor.</p>
