<p><strong>Tuesday, 9 December 2008, 2:42 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZEI">NZEI</a></strong></p>
<p>9th December 2008 For Immediate Release</p>
<p>90 Day Bill Rides Rough-Shod Over Workers - NZEI</p>
<p>The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa says the government&#39;s 90 Day Bill rides rough-shod over workers and pushing it through parliament as a matter of urgency, is ill-considered and irresponsible. NZEI believes the legislation is unfair and unjustified and there is still confusion over exactly how it will be applied.</p>
<p>During the election campaign National Party spokespeople sent out conflicting messages over whether teachers and education workers would be exempt from the Bill, which is intended to cover any workplace of fewer than 20 people. NZEI President Frances Nelson says that issue is still not clear despite the implications a 90 Day probationary period could have for thousands of small schools and early childhood centres around the country.</p>
<p>&quot;Many teachers and principals move to gain promotion but this policy would create an environment which would hamper their career paths as they&#39;d be reluctant to move to a new job where there was no certainty of employment for the first 90 days. It would make it even more difficult for small, rural or remote schools to attract experienced staff,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>NZEI will be supporting efforts to have the legislation overturned.</p>
