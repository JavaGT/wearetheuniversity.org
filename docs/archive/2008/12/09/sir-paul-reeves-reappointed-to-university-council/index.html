<p>Sir Paul Reeves Reappointed To University Council</p>
<p>AUT University Chancellor Sir Paul Reeves has been appointed to the University’s Council for a further four years.</p>
<p>AUT Vice-Chancellor Derek McCormack says Sir Paul has ably led the Council through times of great innovation and growth for the University and the University is honoured that he is willing to continue.</p>
<p>“He brings enormous mana to the University and we are fortunate to have the benefit of his guidance at this time in our development,” says Derek McCormack.</p>
<p>Chancellor of AUT University since 2005, Sir Paul’s involvement in education is relatively recent following a long career of public service. He was ordained a priest in 1960, was a lecturer in church history and served as Director of Christian Education until 1971. He was ordained Bishop of Waiapu in 1971, Bishop of Auckland in 1979 and Primate and Archbishop of Aotearoa, New Zeῡland and Polynesia Diocese of Auckland in 1980.</p>
<p>In 1985 Sir Paul was appointed Governor-General – a position he held until 1990. After his retirement from the vice-regal office Sir Paul was Deputy Leader of the Commonwealth Observer group to South Africa, Chair of the Nelson Mandela Trust, and Visiting Montague Burton Professor of International Relations at the University of Edinburgh. He has also done other work for the Com῭onwealth, most notably in Fiji and Guyana on constitutional reform.</p>
<p>The University of Oxford conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Civil Law in 1985. He has received other honorary degrees, including an LLD of Victoria University of Wellington (1989), a DD of the General Theological Seminary, New York (1992), and the degree of Doctor Honoris Causa of the University of Edinburgh (1994).</p>
<p>Sir Paul was admitted to the Order of New Zealand last year, the country’s highest honour. This was added to an already prestigious list including being made a Knight Bachelor (1985), a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (1985), a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victoria Order (1986) and the Queens&#39; Service Order for public services (1990).</p>
<p>Sir Paul is of Te Ati Awa descent.</p>
