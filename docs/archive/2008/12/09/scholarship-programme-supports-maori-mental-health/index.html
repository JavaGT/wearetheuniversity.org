<p>Tuesday, December 9, 2008<br>Scholarship programme supports Maori mental health</p>
<p>A desire to contribute to Maori mental health has seen Sharran Smith (Ngati Rauru) awarded the inaugural Te Manawaroatanga Te Rau Puawai scholarship at a ceremony in Palmerston North.</p>
<p>The scholarship marks the beginning of the partnership between Te Rau Puawai Workforce 100, the Maori mental health Scholarship Programme at Massey University, and the Manawatu Primary Health Organisation.</p>
<p>The programme sees recipients from partner organisations complete Massey qualifications in a health-related discipline in order to increase the professionalism of the Maori mental health workforce.</p>
<p>Mrs Smith (pictured right) works as an executive assistant at the PHO, but wants to pursue a career as a clinical psychologist.</p>
<p>“I saw the information about the scholarship go across my desk and thought that would be a great opportunity for someone,” Mrs Smith says. “Working in the area of Maori mental health is something I’ve always wanted to do and now I have that opportunity.</p>
<p>Mrs Smith will study psychology at Massey and hopes to one day become a clinical psychologist.</p>
<p>Te Rau Puawai co-ordinator Monica Koia says the aim of the scholarship is to get more Maori qualified so they have access to a range of mental health careers. The partnership enables Maori mental health providers to gain qualifications more relevant to their area, she says.</p>
<p>Manawatu Primary Health Organisation manager Nicky Hart says Te Manawaroatanga – which means “the stout-heartedness” – is an important step for the organisation.</p>

<p>“Maori are over-represented in mental health statistics and this partnership is an opportunity for our people to further their expertise in the field,” she says.</p>
<p>Te Rau Puawai has seen almost 200 students graduate in the past 10 years. The scholarship provides recipients with fees and some course-related costs, a mentor, assistance with study planning and skills and access to Maori community and student networks.</p>
