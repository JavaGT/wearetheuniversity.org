<p>Wednesday, December 17, 2008<br>Festive cheer for first-time buyers</p>
<p>First-time buyers will be cheered by the news that national home affordability has improved 4.6 per cent in the past year, according to the latest figures from Massey University.</p>
<p>It is now much easier to get onto the housing ladder in Southland with affordability – a measure that factors in average prices, pay and interest rates – improving by 21.2 per cent.</p>
<p>Other regions showing improved affordability are Wellington (7.4 per cent), Waikato/Bay of Plenty (6.4 per cent), Auckland (5.9 per cent), Canterbury/Westland (5 per cent) Otago (4.9 per cent) and Taranaki (4.5 per cent).</p>
<p>Manawatu/Wanganui (0.1 per cent) remained stable, while declines in affordability affected Central Otago Lakes (18.4 per cent) followed by Hawke’s Bay (5.6 per cent), Northland (1.9 per cent) and Nelson/ Marlborough (1.9 per cent).</p>
<p>Central Otago Lakes remains the least affordable region, followed by Auckland and Nelson/Marlborough.</p>
<p>Southland is the most affordable region, followed by Otago and Manawatu/Wanganui.</p>
<p>In the past quarter, a 2.2 per cent increase in the national median house price has outweighed the 1 per cent increase in wage rates and static interest rates, resulting in a 1.4% overall deterioration in affordability.</p>
<p>But Professor Bob Hargreaves, Director of the Massey University Real Estate Analysis Unit, says not to read too much into this surprise statistic.</p>
<p>“The median house prices statistic may be skewed upwards due to stricter lending criteria leading to reduced sales volumes for lower cost homes,” he said.</p>

<p>Over the last quarter, six of the twelve regions showed improved affordability; Southland (10.3 per cent) Waikato/Bay of Plenty (5.7 per cent), Otago (4.8 per cent), Wellington (2.5 per cent), Auckland (0.7 per cent) and Manawatu/Wanganui (0.7 per cent).</p>
<p>Regions showing declines in affordability were Northland (11.9 per cent) Hawke’s Bay (8.7 per cent), Central Otago/Lakes (7.4 per cent), Taranaki (5.1 per cent), Canterbury/Westland (2.8 per cent) and Nelson/Marlborough (2.6 per cent).</p>
