<p><strong>Thursday, 4 December 2008, 9:06 am</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Goff welcomes signing of Convention on Cluster Munitions</p>
<p>Labour leader Phil Goff welcomed today’s signing in Oslo of the Conventions on Cluster Munitions which bans the manufacture, possession and use of such weapons by signatory countries.</p>
<p>As former Minister of Disarmament and Arms Control, Phil Goff had strongly promoted the Convention which was agreed to in Dublin earlier this year.</p>
<p>““It is particularly fitting that New Zealand was among the first countries to sign,” Mr Goff said.</p>
<p>“Right from the start we were part of a small group of nations at the forefront of pushing this outcome.”</p>
<p>“In February we hosted the largest ever disarmament conference held in New Zealand with over 500 delegates from more than 100 countries</p>
<p>“Cluster munitions have left a deadly legacy, maiming and killing thousands of civilians, a great many of them children, often long after the war in which they were deployed was over,” he said.</p>
<p>“The tragic consequences of a million unexploded bomblets in Lebanon as a result of the Hezbollah – Israeli conflict spurred us to tackling the issue of munitions which have unacceptable consequences for civilians.”</p>
<p>Mr Goff said the Conventions promoted by New Zealand, Norway, Mexico, Peru, Austria, Ireland and the Holy See was a critical step in breaking the stalemate in Geneva on this issue.</p>
<p>“It is essential to bring the use of cluster munitions to an end.</p>
<p>“I welcome the signing of the Convention on New Zealand’s behalf by our Ambassador for Disarmament in Geneva Don MacKay.</p>
<p>“Don played a critically important role in chairing the key sessions of the Wellington and Dublin conferences which achieved this result,” Mr Goff said.</p>
