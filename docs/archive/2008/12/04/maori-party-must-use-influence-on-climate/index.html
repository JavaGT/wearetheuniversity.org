<p>Maori Party must use influence on climate: Greens</p>
<p>Welcoming the Maori Party&#39;s call today for &#39;urgent and meaningful&#39; action on climate change, the Green Party urges Maori Party Ministers to help rescue New Zealand&#39;s climate credibility.</p>
<p>&quot;It is heartening to hear such strong words from Tariana Turia in a statement today, but her words are in stark contrast to the climate change actions to date from the new National-led Government,&quot; Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons says</p>
<p>&quot;I call on the Maori Party Ministers to use their positions and influence on the National-led Government to save the only &quot;urgent and meaningful&quot; climate policies to date.</p>
<p>&quot;We must prevent the Greens&#39; $1 billion home insulation fund from being scrapped, and retain the energy and cost-saving efficiency standards for lighting and hot-water heating.</p>
<p>&quot;The uncertainty the Government is creating around the ETS, and refusal to commit to climate change targets at the Poznan talks is embarrassing New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the Maori Party will use their influence to prevent New Zealand committing climate and economic suicide.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Fitzsimons also challenged the National-led Government while speaking to &#39;The 350 Challenge&#39; rally at Parliament today. The 350 movement seeks a responsible global solution to climate change.</p>
<p>&quot;National&#39;s current policies would have the world overshooting the point of no return, whereas the 350 movement&#39;s goal is for bold policy for a stable climate.</p>
<p>&quot;The difference is that a 350 goal is based on science, whereas successive New Zealand Governments have played politics with climate change.</p>
<p>&quot;NASA climate scientist James Hansen calculates we must aim for 350 parts per million as a safe long term level of atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>&quot;We passed 350ppm in 1988, the year I attended the first New Zealand conference on climate change and started lecturing on the topic at Auckland University,&quot; Ms Fitzsimons says.</p>
<p>&quot;With levels now at 387ppm and climbing, it is very disappointing that the international press is today carrying stories of New Zealand&#39;s &#39;holding back&#39; in Poland.</p>
<p>&quot;We certainly won&#39;t get to 350 by scrapping every piece of effective climate change policy, and being an obstacle to progress internationally.</p>
<p>&quot;I congratulate the 350 movement and call on the Government to back this vision with action.&quot;</p>
