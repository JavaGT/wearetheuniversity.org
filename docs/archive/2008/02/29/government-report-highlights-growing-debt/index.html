<p>Government report highlights growing debt &amp; lack of student allowances</p>
<p>Students are urging the government to take heed of the depressing statistics revealed in Student Loans and Allowances: 2006, the third report in recent weeks highlighting growing student debt and the lack of access to student allowances.</p>
<p>The report identified that in 2006 the number of students receiving an allowance and not having to rely on a student loan actually fell by 10%. In the same year, the student loan scheme saw the highest number of borrowers and the largest increase in loan borrowing, since 2001.</p>
<p>“The fact that the biggest proportion of borrowers dependent on debt was aged 20-25 years clearly shows that means-testing students on parental income until the age of 25 to determine allowance eligibility is deeply flawed and discriminatory,” said Liz Hawes, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.</p>
<p>“With this policy Labour is saying families can and will support their children until the age of 25. Students and their parents know this simply isn’t possible – low incomes, high cost of living and extra expectations such as Kiwisaver leave many families with nothing at the end of the week”, said Hawes.</p>
<p>This report is the latest in a number of publications highlighting students struggling financially. NZUSA’s 2007 Student Income and Expenditure Survey showed students’ key concerns are financial, with over three quarters calling for a living allowance for all and 59 percent citing financial stress as affecting their study. The Westpac Tertiary Banking 2008 study revealed a staggering 42% of students’ primary worry heading into study this year was money.</p>
<p>“This report clearly shows current policy on student support is unsustainable. No amount of government spin can hide the fact that the current system doesn’t work – Labour’s approach of tweaking around the edges has been proven not to work in this latest report. Students and their families need positive action with genuine outcomes now”, said Hawes.</p>
<p>NZUSA is calling for the introduction of a living allowance for all students to address the nation’s growing problem of student debt.</p>
<p>Student allowances are financial grants to support learners in higher education, and currently around a third of students qualify for allowances, many of which are only partial. Student loans are a debt accrued through study that must be repaid compulsorily through PAYE with a low repayment threshold and a high repayment rate</p>
