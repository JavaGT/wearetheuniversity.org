<p>For immediate release 26 February 2008</p>
<p>ASTE Members at EastBay REAP enter</p>
<p>Day 6 of Strike Action</p>
<p>Unprecedented action by ASTE members who work for EastBay REAP (rural education activities programmes) based in Whakatāne with bases in Ōpotiki and Kawerau) is taking them into a 6th day of strike action this year. “Striking workers are resolved to continue taking action in protest at their employer’s failure to make any significant shift in her bargaining stance, ASTE advocate”, Jenny Chapman said.</p>
<p>Ms Chapman continued by saying “It is unheard of that workers in this sector would take such prolonged action. This reflects the seriousness with which members view the unacceptable way in which the CEO of this REAP is prepared to treat her staff that is so out of synch with other REAPs across the country. The members simply want a fair deal for all members at Eastbay REAP”.</p>
<p>Picketing workers are seeing a high degree of support for their actions from their communities as they hand out leaflets and information in the streets of these three towns.</p>
