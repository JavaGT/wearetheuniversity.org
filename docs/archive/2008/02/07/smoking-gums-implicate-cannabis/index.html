<p>Smoking gums implicate cannabis</p>
<p>Heavy cannabis smoking has been identified as a major cause of gum disease in a study involving researchers from the University of Otago, King’s College in London, Duke University and the University of North Carolina in the USA.</p>
<p>Using data gathered through the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (DMHDS), which tracks a group of 1000 people born in Dunedin in 1972-73, they found heavy cannabis smoking was responsible for more than one-third of the new cases of gum disease by age 32.</p>
<p>Their findings have been published in the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
<p>Professor Murray Thomson from the University of Otago School of Dentistry says<br>periodontal disease, or gum disease, is one of the most common diseases of adulthood and causes a range of problems, including the loss of support for the teeth.</p>
<p>“There is also an emerging body of evidence that it may also be a risk factor for heart disease, stroke and even pre-term birth,” says Professor Thomson.</p>
<p>Cigarette smoking has been a long-established risk factor for gum disease but this is the first study looking at cannabis.</p>
<p>“The problem is not the smoke itself – it’s what’s in the smoke,” he says.</p>
<p>“In the mouth, there is a fine balance between tissue destruction and tissue healing and the various toxins in cannabis smoke disrupt that.”</p>
<p>Professor Thomson says their findings have added strength because rather than using a single cross-sectional survey, they used a longitudinal study in which the state of participants’ gums and their use of cannabis and tobacco were tracked over many years.</p>

<p>For the study, they identified heavy cannabis users as those in the top 20% of cannabis use, equivalent to an average of 41 or more occasions per year between ages 18 and 32.</p>
<p>Professor Thomson says they had to be mindful that cannabis smokers are also much more likely to be cigarette smokers.</p>
<p>“But even after allowing for this, we found heavy cannabis smokers had three times the risk of having established gum disease by age 32,” he says.</p>
<p>“When we looked at just those who had never smoked tobacco, the relationship between cannabis and gum disease was even stronger.</p>
<p>“We have been able to calculate that over one-third of new cases of gum disease between the ages of 26 and 32 could be put down to cannabis use.”</p>
<p>Professor Thomson says the findings account for some of the unexplained variation in gum disease among younger adults.</p>
