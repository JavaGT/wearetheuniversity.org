<p>Maori incomes fall further behind</p>
<p>The gap between what Maori and Pakeha earn has steadily increased under Labour, says National’s Maori Affairs (Culture &amp; Development) spokeswoman, Georgina te Heuheu.</p>
<p>“On Tuesday, the Prime Minister spoke of reducing inequalities, yet a look at income parity between Māori and Pakeha reveals a widening gap.”</p>
<p>The New Zealand Income Survey shows that in 2000, Māori aged over 15 earned 82% of what Pakeha earned. In 2007, Māori aged over 15 earned just 73% of what Pakeha earned.</p>
<p>“The growing disparity in incomes is even more alarming when considered in dollar terms. In 2000, Maori aged over 15 earned $86 a week less than Pakeha. Last year, Maori aged over 15 earned $197 a week less than Pakeha.</p>
<p>“Labour came into office promising to close the gaps between Maori and Pakeha. Despite all Labour’s rhetoric, the income gap has widened significantly.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder incomes are not improving when Maori students are failing in far higher numbers than Pakeha at school, and when little has been done to address chronic truancy.</p>
<p>“Labour has had almost nine years to improve outcomes for Maori and has, instead, left a legacy of neglect.”</p>
