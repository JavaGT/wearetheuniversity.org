<p>National’s Commitment to Dump Negative Policies for Education Must Stay, NZEI Says</p>
<p>The National Party’s decision to dump bulk funding of teacher pay and national testing of seven year olds under Katherine Rich’s term as education spokeperson must stay if the party is to retain credibility with the education sector, NZEI says.</p>
<p>NZEI, the union representing 46,000 education staff mainly in the early childhood and primary sector, says Katherine Rich had had a consultative and considered approach to policy making that was welcomed by the sector.</p>
<p>“As National’s education spokeperson, Katherine was willing to engage and consult widely with people working in education,” NZEI President Frances Nelson says. “NZEI welcomed National’s dumping of negative policies for students and teachers such as national testing of seven year olds and the bulk funding of teacher pay under her stewardship.”</p>
<p>“We welcome Anne Tolley to her new role and expect that she will continue to engage openly with NZEI and others in the sector to ensure sound education policy is adopted.”</p>
