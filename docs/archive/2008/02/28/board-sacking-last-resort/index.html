<p>Board Sacking Last Resort</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that the sacking of the Hawkes Bay DHBs board and replacement by a Commissioner is a last resort and not an intimation of things to come, says New Zealand First health spokesperson Barbara Stewart.</p>
<p>“Capital &amp; Coast DHB got into trouble for its perceived financial ineptitude, its failure to run a large and complex organisation whilst building a new hospital and the running down of specialist services because of staff and funding shortages.</p>
<p>“Now the Hawkes Bay board has been fired and replaced by a Commissioner.</p>
<p>“In both cases these are drastic measures which, at least in the short term, will result in more upheaval for the medical staff and consequently for their patients.</p>
<p>“Our health system is unnecessarily complicated for the size of our population. We have 21 district health boards – each expected to provide its population with every required service and many running short of money as a result.</p>
<p>“We also have an unbelievably long-winded equipment purchasing process which delays by years the provision of the most modern equipment available.</p>
<p>“Obviously the health system needs some reorganisation but boards should not be routinely publicly castigated because they disagree with the Minister or have funding problems.</p>
<p>“That would further reduce confidence in the health system and demoralise medical staff who have enough to contend with already,” said Mrs Stewart.</p>
<p>DHB populations are approximately:</p>
