<p>Tuesday, February 12, 2008<br>Ronald Chippindale a loss to aviation students</p>
<p>The General Manager of the University&#39;s School of Aviation, Captain Ashok Poduval, today paid tribute to the late Ronald Chippindale, an adjunct lecturer at the school for the past seven years.</p>
<p>Mr Chippindale, 75, taught three papers on air safety investigation to third-year students doing the Bachelor of Aviation (Air Transport Pilot) and Bachelor of Aviation Management degrees offered by Massey. The former chief air accident investigator was struck and killed by a car while walking near his home in Porirua this morning.</p>
<p>&quot;Ron was a remarkable man who has made an invaluable contribution to the aviation industry particularly in the field of air safety,&quot; Captain Poduval says. &quot;The three papers he taught were highly regarded and unique due to his unrivalled experience in air safety in New Zealand. I have passed on my sincere condolences to his family and wish to extend deepest sympathy to all his friends, past and present, colleagues and students.&quot;</p>
<p>All three papers – introductory, basic and advanced air safety investigation – were taught extramurally but Mr Chippindale also ran contact courses for students on the Auckland and Palmerston North campuses. Students enrolled in the papers will be contacted shortly to discuss their options.</p>
