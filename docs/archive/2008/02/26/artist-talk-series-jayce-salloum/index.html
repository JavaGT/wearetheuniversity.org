<p>Lebanese Canadian Jayce Salloum is a media artist and cultural activist who has worked in installation, photography, performance and video since 1975. His residency at the Govett-Brewster sees a continuation of his ongoing project untitled, a video installation of single-channel works addressing social and political realities and conceived as, “an approach to research or reading, an active living archive”. His work engages with issues of globalism, imperialism and the notion of borders, documenting the lives and opinions of displaced peoples, activists and victims in places such as Lebanon and the former Yugoslavia. During his residency Salloum will develop new work exploring similar issues within a New Zealand context like the recent Terrorist Suppression Act.</p>
<p>Jayce Salloum is a Govett-Brewster International Artist in Residence. This Taranaki residence programme is presented in partnership with WITT and is supported by Creative New Zealand.</p>
