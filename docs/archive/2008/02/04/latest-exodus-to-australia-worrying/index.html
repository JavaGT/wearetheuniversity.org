<p>Latest exodus to Australia worrying</p>
<p>National Party Leader John Key says immigration figures showing an acceleration in the number of Kiwis leaving to live in Australia are a wake-up call for the Government.</p>
<p>“These numbers are further evidence of the failure of the Labour-led Government to address the core issues of why Kiwis are leaving.</p>
<p>“They are a vote of no confidence in Helen Clark’s Government.</p>
<p>“There is no other way to describe figures that show 28,000 Kiwis left for Australia last year – an increase of 7,300 over 2006, and the highest net loss in 20 years.</p>
<p>“They highlight the fact that we need to make meaningful changes if we are to encourage tens of thousands of people to stay here.</p>
<p>“Our economy cannot afford to lose them.</p>
<p>“Kiwis are tired of waiting for tax cuts and improvements in their basic living conditions. That’s why record numbers of them are voting with their feet.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is already struggling under a skills shortage and this exodus will add to those worries.</p>
<p>“Labour has not taken advantage of the strong tailwind it inherited, failing to transform the economy to a level where many of these people want to stay.”</p>
