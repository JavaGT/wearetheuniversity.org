<p>Dunedin Greens support public transport on World Car Free Day</p>
<p>The Dunedin Branch of the Green Party is honouring World Car free Day on Monday 22 September by hiring an offpeak bus to celebrate public transport in Dunedin City. Bus patronage here has risen 50% since mid 2006, especially recently with the introduction of extended services, but there is still more to do to make public transport affordable and available to all citizens as a real alternative to car use. The Green Party has been at the forefront of national initiatives in increased government funding for public transport throughout the country, beyond Auckland and Wellington.</p>
<p>“The Green vision is for practical public transport system that offers a real choice for all - freeing people from having to use cars when they don’t have to” said Dunedin South candidate, Shane Gallagher, “The Car free day slogan is “Go carfree and don’t stop”, and we want to support people who want to make that choice. Congratulations to the Otago Regional Council, Dunedin City Council and the bus companies for what they have achieved so far towards that goal. “</p>
<p>The Green bus will be travelling through town between 9:30am and 2:30, handing out bus timetables and passenger transport information.</p>
