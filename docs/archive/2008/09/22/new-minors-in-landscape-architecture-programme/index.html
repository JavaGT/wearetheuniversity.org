<p><strong>Media Release</strong><br><strong>22 September 2008</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Minors Offered in Landscape Architecture Programme</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Changes Reflect Emerging Specialisation</strong></p>
<p>Lincoln University has confirmed four new Minors for its flagship Bachelor of Landscape Architecture, reflecting increasing levels of specialisation within the profession.</p>
<p>The four new Minors have been introduced from Semester 1 of 2009, allowing students to develop specialisms in Design Critque, Maori Studies, Spatial Planning, or Urban Systems,</p>
<p>Neil Challenger, Group Leader of Landscape Architecture, says the Minors acknowledge that the profession is changing and there are new opportunities to specialise in areas such as urban development, landscape planning and the design of the Maori landscape.</p>
<p>Lincoln University established New Zealand’s first professional programme in Landscape Architecture in 1968 and the first Bachelors degree (BLA) 20 years latter.</p>
<p>Challenger says the changes have achieved an undergraduate programme which is strong and targetted. It includes special features such as a paper on indigenous issues in landscape architecture, the only one of its kind world wide.<br>The BLA is as four-year, 480 credit degree which also has a graduate-entry option that allows entrants to complete the Graduate Entry BLA in two years. Both programmes are fully accredited with the New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects (NZILA), which has reciprocity with Australia and Hong Kong. BLA graduates then have the option of completing a one-year Masters programme, which doubles as an accrediation programme for the New Zealand Planning Institute.<br>Challenger says the outlook for landscape architecture graduates remains bright. “There’s been very strong demand for graduates these past few years – with really good jobs available for the top students – and in some cases students have three or four offers to consider upon graduation.<br>“The majority of the career opportunities are currently in the private sector, but many graduates find themselves working on major public sector issues either as contractors, consultants and advisors. The opportunities to specialise are significant.” The four Minors are:</p>
