<p>Press Release</p>
<p>30 September 2008</p>
<p>It’s always happening in Hauraki-Waikato!</p>
<p>“Hamilton shines” said Angeline Greensill, the Maori Party candidate for Hauraki-Waikato. “On Sunday, I took a walk through Hamilton and was amazed by the energy and activity happening on the streets”.</p>
<p>“The People&#39;s Procession arrived in Garden Place, with many whanau signing the petition to remove GST from all food” said Greensill.</p>
<p>“This effort shows how important Hamilton is to the nation’s heartbeat and I was encouraged to listen to young families support the People&#39;s Procession”.</p>
<p>“The Maori Party supports the effort to make food more affordable and will gratefully receive the People&#39;s Procession when it arrives in Wellington later this week (Friday)”.</p>
<p>“It was also World Deaf Day and I had the great pleasure of meeting a deaf group promoting trilingualism here in Hamilton” said Greensill.</p>
<p>“Sign language needs more support and trilingual sign language expertise should have more allocated resources”.</p>
<p>Mrs Greensill also signalled the significance of the annual hui of the Maori Women&#39;s Welfare League which this year marks its 56th annual conference.</p>
<p>“The Maori Women’s Welfare League Conference starts in Manukau City this week, highlighting the many positive initiatives developed and supported by Maori women, so I encourage young Maori women in particular to take an interest in this election and in your community”.</p>
