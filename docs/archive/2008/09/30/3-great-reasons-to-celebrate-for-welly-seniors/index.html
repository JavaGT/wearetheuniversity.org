<p>3 Great Reasons To Celebrate For Wellington Seniors</p>
<p>October the 1st gives Wellington seniors three great reasons to celebrae, the Labour Candidate for Wellington Central, Grant Robertson said today. Three Labour-led government initiatives come into force with increases in superannuation, free off peak transport and increased subsidies for hearing aids.</p>
<p>“As of tomorrow, NZ Super increases $45 per fortnight for married couples and $23 for singles. 35,420 people in the Wellington region will benefit from this initiative to the tune of $157,273,241 per annum,” Grant said.</p>
<p>“I think these increases will make a real difference for seniors, together with the other new initiatives implemented by Labour tomorrow,”</p>
<p>“Thousands of SuperGold Card holders in Wellington will be eligible for free off-peak public transport travel from 9am to 3pm and from 6.30pm to the end of service on weekdays, and any time on weekends and public holidays. This will be a great boost for seniors involvement in the community, and what is more it will be good for the environment. ”</p>
<p>“The subsidy for new hearing aids will also increase from $198 to $500 per hearing aid for SuperGold Card holders 65 and over who have their hearing aids fitted on or after 1 October 2008,”</p>
<p>“I am delighted that the Labour-led government is able to bring in these measures. I also acknowledge NZ First’s role in the SuperGold Card developments. These changes will improve the quality of life for many Wellingtonians, and help ease the pressure of price rises for food and electricity. Labour will continue to ensure that our seniors are supported to live healthy and active lives. “ Grant said.</p>
