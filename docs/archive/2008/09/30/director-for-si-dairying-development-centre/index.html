<p>New Executive Director for SI Dairying Development Centre</p>
<p>The partners of the highly successful South Island Dairying Development Centre (SIDDC) are pleased to appoint Ron Pellow to the role of Executive Director.</p>
<p>SIDDC is a partnership formed between Lincoln University, DairyNZ, Crop and Food Research, LIC, Ravensdown, and the South Island Dairy Event (SIDE) network of farmers to enhance the competitive advantage of dairying in the South Island.</p>
<p>SIDDC incorporates the high profile Lincoln University Dairy Farm, numerous research and extension projects, and is looking to further expand its influence into other regions of the South Island.</p>
<p>Ron Pellow is South Island Regional Manager for DairyNZ and will continue in this role on a part-time basis, while also taking on the position with SIDDC.</p>
<p>The Chair of the SIDDC Board and Vice-Chancellor of Lincoln University, Professor Roger Field, says the Board is pleased to appoint a candidate with the breadth of experience that Ron brings and someone very familiar with the workings and objectives of the partners.</p>
<p>“With substantial agricultural sector experience, Ron has a range of skills well suited to the position. He has a strong research, development and extension background, with strengths in environmental management, strategy and commercial disciplines.”</p>
<p>Mr Pellow, who starts in early October, sees great potential in the Executive Director&#39;s role.</p>
<p>“In the last six years the SIDDC partners have built a unique technology transfer tool in the Lincoln University Dairy Farm,” says Mr Pellow. “It is commercially relevant to a wide range of dairy farmers and has allowed SIDDC to use the same principles to support the development of the Southland Demonstration Farm. The farm is able to provide vital environmental monitoring data and is a great platform for production and profit benchmarking and for trialling new technologies.”</p>
