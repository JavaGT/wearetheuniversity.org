<p>Hamilton Collision Involving A Bus</p>
<p>New Zealand Police National News Release</p>
<p>1 September 2008</p>
<p>Hamilton Police are crediting the actions of a bus driver following a collision in the city late this morning.</p>
<p>Sergeant Philip Ruddell of the Hamilton Strategic traffic Unit said the crash happened at a roundabout at the intersection of SH1/ Greenwood St and Killarney Rd about 11.30am.</p>
<p>&quot;Serious Crash Unit investigators are carrying out a scene examination at present.</p>
<p>&quot;Initial indications on the cause of the crash are that a northbound Nissan van has gone straight through the roundabout striking the westbound bus.&quot;</p>
<p>The impact of the collision propelled the bus driver from his seat and the bus careered between two power-poles, ending up on top of a car parked in a car dealership.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point in time Police would like to acknowledge the actions of the bus driver who despite suffering facial injuries remained entirely professional seeing to the well being of his passengers,&quot; said Mr Ruddell.</p>
<p>St John ambulance spokesman Warren Rosser said two ambulances and a number of emergency response vehicles arrived at the scene to assess the injured.</p>
<p>&quot;Three patients were transported to Waikato Hospital by ambulance, a 51-year-old female passenger from the bus with chest injuries, a man aged in his sixties believed to have been the van driver suffering from leg injuries and another woman, age unknown, suffering from minor injuries.&quot;</p>
<p>Killarney Rd remained closed for over two hours as emergency service personnel and salvage crews worked to remove the three damaged vehicles.</p>
