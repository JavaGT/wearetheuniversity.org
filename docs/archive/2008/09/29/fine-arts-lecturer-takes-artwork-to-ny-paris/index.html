<p>Monday, September 29, 2008<br>Fine arts lecturer takes artwork to New York, Paris</p>
<p>The original artwork of a dozen self-taught New Zealand artists will be showcased in New York, after a university lecturer was invited to host a stand at next year&#39;s International Outsider Art Fair in January</p>
<p>Fine Arts lecturer Stuart Shepherd will also take work by self-taught Australian artists to the fair New York. It will be the first time in the fair’s 17-year history that work by Australasian artists has been on show.</p>
<p>“To be invited to have a stand there is really thrilling,” Mr Shepherd says. All the work will be for sale, and Mr Shepherd says sales that result will be a real affirmation for the artists, who often struggle financially on the fringes of the art community.</p>
<p>“I want to encourage serious investors to value this stuff. If it’s for economic reasons, that’s fine. It puts value on the people too.”</p>
<p>He plans to show between 10 and 100 works by each artist. The stand at the fair will happen in collaboration with the New Zealand Trade Commission, Lower Hutt&#39;s New Dowse Museum, and charitable trust Arts Access Aotearoa.</p>
<p>“I see this as an opportunity to close the gap between self-taught artists and the wider community. Some of my colleagues struggle to see why I’m excited about this work but this is a great opportunity to legitimise a section that has been marginalised.”</p>
<p>After the New York fair, Mr Shepherd will also showcase the New Zealand work at a contemporary and outside art show at the Galerie Impaire in Paris.</p>
