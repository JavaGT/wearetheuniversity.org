<p>Greens support removal of tobacco displays from retail outlets</p>
<p>The Green Party strongly supports the call to remove tobacco displays from their prominent position next to checkout counters in most supermarkets and dairies around New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Health select committee today released a report today calling for tobacco and cigarette displays to be out of sight in retail stores around New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no question that having cigarettes prominently displayed at the checkout counters in thousands of retail outlets around New Zealand is a constant temptation to young people and people who have given up smoking,&quot; Green Party Health Spokesperson Sue Kedgley says.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to remember that cigarettes are not just ordinary consumer products. They are highly addictive and harmful substances, and tobacco related diseases are a huge burden on society and cost to our economy. So it&#39;s crazy to allow these harmful products to be advertised and promoted in almost every dairy and supermarket in the land.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Kedgley says the 20,000-signature petition to remove tobacco displays from sight was strongly supported by public health groups and members of the public during the select committee hearing.</p>
<p>She hopes the Government will act urgently on the Health committee&#39;s recommendation and call for the removal of tobacco displays.</p>
<p>&quot;For the sake of our children, we need to remove these displays out of sight, so that children do not see them every time they enter a shop. This would be another positive step in our fight to reduce tobacco related disease.&quot;</p>
