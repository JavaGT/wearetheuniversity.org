<p>Thursday, September 18, 2008<br>Fashionable graduate on the verge of success</p>
<p>The inaugural winner of a $10,000 fashion development grant is a former Massey University School of Design student who has already had a taste of success.</p>
<p>Michelle Wilson was yesterday named the winner of Verge’s $10,000 Business Development Grant after showing her Winter 2009 collection at Air New Zealand Fashion Week.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old Auckland-based designer, who shows under the label Michelle Yvette, was one of five to show as part of the Verge Breakthrough Designers Show.</p>
<p>Ms Wilson was inspired by the beauty of Afghanistan and opened the show with models in burqas shipped from the war-torn country.</p>
<p>She was judged the winner by buyers, media and fashion players in the front rows of the show on the basis of whose garments were the most commercially viable.</p>
<p>The Verge Breakthrough Designers Programme offers designers mentoring and support to show at Air New Zealand Fashion Week, including a &quot;boot camp&quot; on topics including marketing and finances. This was the first year a grant has been offered.</p>
<p>Ms Wilson, who completed a Bachelor of Design majoring in fashion design at the Wellington campus in 2004, was asked the previous year to design a shirt for Lord of the Rings star Viggo Mortensen to wear at the premier of Return of the King after attending his photography exhibition at the university.</p>
