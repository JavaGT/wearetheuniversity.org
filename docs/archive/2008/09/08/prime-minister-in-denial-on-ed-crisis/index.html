<p>Prime Minister in denial on ED crisis</p>
<p>National Party Health spokesman Tony Ryall says the Prime Minister is in total denial about the crisis in our hospital emergency departments.</p>
<p>“Perhaps the Prime Minister has stopped reading the newspaper. Month after month serious warnings have been sounded. Doctors and nurses report patients languishing on trolleys in corridors unable to get a bed. Occasionally they are wrongly sent home by overstressed staff.</p>
<p>“Like her Health Minister, the Prime Minister has her head in the sand. Denial doesn’t help fix the problems.”</p>
<p>Mr Ryall is commenting after a report indicated that hundreds of people were dying because of overstretched hospital emergency departments.</p>
<p>“Just last week, Waikato Hospital was in ‘code red’. In June, the Auckland city ED was in ‘code purple’. And a few days ago, National revealed average waiting times at the Wellington Hospital emergency department had leapt in some months by 137%.</p>
<p>“There have been photos on the front pages of the papers of patients lying in corridors. Yet the blinkered Prime Minister says there’s no proof of any problem.”</p>
<p>Mr Ryall notes that Helen Clark once promised the people that there’d be a hospital bed for every patient for as long as they needed it, and gridlock because of winter illnesses would never happen under Labour</p>
<p>“Helen Clark does not talk about that any more. She has a selective memory about her broken promises.”</p>
<p>Mr Ryall says National has a plan to improve hospital and health services for New Zealanders.</p>
<p>“Kiwis want more doctors and nurses, and fewer bureaucrats.</p>
<p>“National is determined to deliver Better, Sooner, More Convenient healthcare to New Zealanders.”</p>
