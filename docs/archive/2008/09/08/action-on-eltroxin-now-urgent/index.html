<p>Action on Eltroxin now urgent</p>
<p>Immediate action is needed to resolve an unfolding crisis of ill health from a new formulation of Eltroxin, a medicine used to treat an underactive thyroid, says National Party Associate Health spokeswoman Jackie Blue.</p>
<p>“Ever since patients started taking the new formulation earlier this year problems started to surface.</p>
<p>“What started as a trickle of bad reactions to Eltroxin is now an avalanche.</p>
<p>“I don’t buy the excuses. Medsafe and Pharmac have known about this problem for months and nothing has happened.</p>
<p>“It has been left to Pharmacists to scramble around to find alternative stocks from overseas.</p>
<p>“But the stocks coming in aren&#39;t subsidised so there&#39;s a cost to the patient, which is a problem for some.”</p>
<p>Dr Blue, a former breast physician, says reports to the Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring (CARM) in Dunedin have skyrocketed.</p>
<p>“Earlier this year the number of adverse reports was less than 50. Now it’s up to 800.</p>
<p>“This problem is real. It’s not psychosomatic. People’s lives have been turned upside down as a result.</p>
<p>“I’d urge anyone suffering ill health as a result of the new formulation Eltroxin to report it to CARM either through their pharmacist, GP, or email <a href="mailto:carmnz@stonebow.otago.ac.nz">carmnz@stonebow.otago.ac.nz</a> .</p>
<p>“Maybe then the Government just might begin to appreciate that there is an unfolding crisis,” says Dr Blue.</p>
