<p><strong>Monday, 8 September 2008, 3:41 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Workers_Party_of_New_Zealand">Workers Party of New Zealand</a></strong></p>
<p>Candidate subject to discriminatory law</p>
<p>Workers Party candidate for Christchurch East, Paul Hopkinson, may be forced to step aside as a candidate due to a discriminatory clause in the 1993 Electoral Act. Because Paul Hopkinson is a school teacher in a state school, he is subject to a clause which could require him to take unpaid leave for the duration of the election campaign. &quot;This clause is onerous and discriminatory because it prevents people from participating fully in the electoral process,&quot; he said. &quot;Unless you have the backing of a large wealthy political party, or are independently wealthy, you are unable to participate. I should not have to take leave; I should not have to choose between standing in the elections and supporting myself and my family&quot; he added. If he was employed by a private school, he would not be subject to the clause. &quot;This is an important issue because this anti-democratic clause means thousands of New Zealanders are prevented from becoming fully involved in the elections,&quot; he said.</p>
