<p>Dr Paul Hutchison MP<br>National Party Tertiary Education Spokesman</p>
<p>8 September 2008</p>
<p>Private tertiary sector must get fair go</p>
<p>Labour continues to show huge prejudice against private tertiary establishments (PTE’s), to the detriment of quality, choice, and value for money, says National’s Tertiary Education spokesman, Paul Hutchison.</p>
<p>“A classic example is real estate salesperson courses, where Labour refuses to fund PTE’s for short courses but pays polytechnics large amounts in subsidies, irrespective of the outcome.</p>
<p>“We are not talking insignificant numbers. More than 10,000 people enrolled in real estate sales person’s courses in 2005, and in 2007 the numbers almost reached 9,000.</p>
<p>“It is ludicrous that the Training and Further Education College developed, patented, and gained NZQA approval for a three week course but was given no subsidy for students, but the polytech that purchased that same course from the college, was given a $1,300 subsidy for each participant.</p>
<p>“This is about having a level playing field. It is about aligning quality of teaching and results with a fair funding formula.</p>
<p>“It is hardly encouraging choice for students when PTE’s are unable to offer subsidised fees for students because they languish in a funding vacuum.</p>
<p>“The student is far more likely to take the course at a polytech, which receives up to $1,600 of government funding per student for a notional 280-hour course.</p>
<p>“Students need to be assured that courses are value for money and are of an expected standard – they must also have as wide a choice as possible. At the same time, all funding must be proved to be a good use of taxpayers’ dollars.</p>
<p>“Labour’s prejudice against PTE’s appears to be in direct contradiction to all of these aims.”</p>
