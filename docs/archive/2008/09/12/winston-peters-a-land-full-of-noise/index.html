<h3>A Land Full Of Noise</h3>
<p>Thank you for your invitation to be here today.</p>
<p>If you believe some media reports you were probably expecting some kind of monster with a red coat, forked feet, horns, and a tail, breathing fire and smoke!</p>
<p>Sorry if you are disappointed. It’s only me! No horns, no tail, no problem!</p>
<p>There is an old proverb.</p>
<p><strong>“You should only believe half of what you see, and none of which you hear”</strong></p>
<p>That applies to what this talk is about.</p>
<p>Some thoughts about what is happening in front of your eyes in the media and what is going on to subvert democracy in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It goes to the heart of the basic Kiwi belief that everyone is entitled to a fair go – and that even the criminal facing the most serious charges is entitled to a fair trial.</p>
<p>Our whole justice system is founded on this.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people died last century protecting societies that were unshaken in their resolve to never let go of their inherent fairness.</p>
<p>It is an ideal that people are still prepared to die for.</p>
<p>However there are some people in our society who see themselves above all that.</p>
<p>There is one group you will not see being persecuted on television, on the radio or in the newspapers.</p>
<p>There is one group that will not be brought before Parliament’s Privileges Committee.</p>
<p>Advertisement - scroll to continue reading</p>
<p>Except in rare and exceptional circumstances, or a ratings war, there is one group who will not be the subject of a concerted campaign of vilification and disparagement by the media.</p>
<p>That group is the media itself.</p>
<p>They are like a school of piranhas circling society, seeking to slash, tear, maim and destroy anything that shows any signs of weakness, non-conformity or heaven forbid – criticises the media.</p>
<p>The 18th century British philosopher and Member of Parliament Edmund Burke said that there were three Estates in Parliament, but in the Reporters’ Gallery, there sat a Fourth Estate, far more important than them all.</p>
<p>The expression ‘Fourth Estate’ is now taken to cover not just the press but the whole of the mass media.</p>
<p>The term has a distinguished ring.</p>
<p>It creates an image of a profession – serious – responsible and public spirited.</p>
<p>At its best the media is a key element in our democracy.</p>
<p>But in New Zealand the mainstream media are in trouble and it shows.</p>
<p>Don’t get this wrong. There are still some journalists of the highest standards with ethics.</p>
<p>But something is seriously wrong with the state of journalism.</p>
<p>It is most apparent in the falling off in journalistic standards.</p>
<p>What standard should we expect of journalists?</p>
<p>Well we do not expect infallibility any more than we do in any other system in which people strive to find the truth - knowing that in practice the truth is elusive and sometimes found in differing versions.</p>
<p>But we are entitled to expect a genuine commitment from journalists to inform the public.</p>
<p>That is the opposite of misleading the public – deluding the public, misinforming the public, and going on ego trips.</p>
<p>Somehow we have got to point where inaccuracy and downright lies are now accepted by journalists if they add to the impact of the story.</p>
<p>Why is this happening?</p>
<p>All too often journalists are working under pressure – and the temptation to cut corners gets the upper hand.</p>
<p>There is time pressure – the race to pre-empt rivals by breaking or revealing a story –even if all the facts have not been properly checked.</p>
<p>There is also financial and commercial pressure – the imperative to deliver “scandal” stories that will promote the product and make money for the proprietors.</p>
<p>Hence the hunt for sensation - the next ‘big story’.</p>
<p>One journalist in Parliament told my senior press secretary last week that she had suggested a number of stories to her news editor about important legislation being passed.</p>
<p>She was told to forget them and to go for Winston Peters. Apparently Winston Peters sells newspapers and attracts television viewers.</p>
<p>Never mind that thousands of peoples’ lives were being affected by the legislation!</p>
<p>And that is the real nub of the issue here.</p>
<p>Editors of our major newspapers, television stations and radio stations have all decided getting rid of Peters is the most important political story in the country.</p>
<p>In fact some of have made it their sole focus – with one going as far as saying that even if Winston Peters is innocent he should be sacked.</p>
<p>People wonder why I am at odds with the media from time to time.</p>
<p>But how would they feel if every editor of every newspaper ganged up and said it is time for you to go.</p>
<p>They have decided it is not up to the people of New Zealand, but them – and that is what incenses us most.</p>
<p>They even have the audacity to criticise the Prime Minister when she wants to follow the principles of natural justice.</p>
<p>Let me give you one more example.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday night I appeared before Parliament’s Privileges Committee to give my side of the story.</p>
<p>TV3 decided to screen it live – or so they said.</p>
<p>When it wasn’t going their way they cut the feed off – and then went to a failed broadcaster and TVNZ reject who is part of a court case I am taking against TVNZ, who then spewed his bile.</p>
<p>This after TV3 ratings were over one hundred thousand viewers larger than they would normally be.</p>
<p>No wonder talkback went wild.</p>
<p>Things weren’t going their way so TV3 cut the feed – now let me ask you where is the justice in that.</p>
<p>The announcement last month that Fairfax Media are to slash 160 jobs in New Zealand signals a further fall in standards.</p>
<p>Once it was an article of faith in journalism that the facts were sacred.</p>
<p>Now if no facts are to be found - it is a case of making some up.</p>
<p>For the media facts are no longer sacrosanct.</p>
<p>There is a temptation to get creative, inventive, and start embellishing them.</p>
<p>This has bred a style of journalism that is:</p>
<p> Shallow</p>
<p> Lacking in proportion</p>
<p> Cavalier with the facts</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that more and more people are abandoning the mainstream media as their prime source of information?</p>
<p>What is happening within the media now is that they are all taking in each other’s washing.</p>
<p>This practice has been referred to as “churnalism”.</p>
<p>This involves recycling second hand stories without checking facts – without seeking corroboration and without adding anything that is new or of value.</p>
<p>It also means that journalists steer clear of providing BOTH SIDES of a story.</p>
<p>Journalists seem to be unable to carefully balance sets of conflicting facts and then let the public make up their own minds.</p>
<p>They believe that they have to tell you that someone is a “baddie” and someone else is a “goodie”.</p>
<p>The goodies and baddies are decided at the morning editorial meetings.</p>
<p>You have no say – after all the journalists are the experts.</p>
<p>They are at least five years out of secondary school with a journalism diploma.</p>
<p>They are all experts in every subject under the sun and they actually believe their opinions are important.</p>
<p>Einstein was a slow learner compared to this lot.</p>
<p>Journalists should be reminded that ultimately their profession rests on trust.</p>
<p>If their stories are not to be trusted they have no credibility.</p>
<p>Their stories will not be read or watched.</p>
<p>Many journalists are also blogsters. They write their opinions on the Internet.</p>
<p>There is an inherent danger in this.</p>
<p>How can a journalist report fairly on an issue involving New Zealand First when he or she is demanding my resignation on their blogsite?</p>
<p>If you raise this issue with them, they look bewildered, or worse, offended.</p>
<p>They do not understand that if they take a public position on an issue it is impossible to be seen as a neutral observer acting on behalf of the public.</p>
<p>Tell me, how much are you being told of political policies - the things that will happen after the election?</p>
<p>How much critical appraisal have you seen of the National Party’s policies – or lack of them?</p>
<p>It is not as if there are no serious issues for journalists to get their atrophied investigative skills into, for example:</p>
<p> The huge losses among finance and property companies that has seen hard working Kiwis relieved of billions of dollars</p>
<p> The dire state of the balance of payments</p>
<p> The ongoing exodus of the young and the restless to Australia</p>
<p> The threadbare policy positions of some parties and their failure to address the real issues facing New Zealand</p>
<p> The loss of our prime assets into overseas ownership</p>
<p>No, the media prefer to hound New Zealand First on the basis of speculation and innuendo.</p>
<p>Against New Zealand First the media turned into a hunting pack.</p>
<p>The media campaign against us can be summed up in three words:</p>
<p> Unfounded</p>
<p> Disproportionate</p>
<p> Scurrilous</p>
<p>We acknowledge the media have an important job to do.</p>
<p>But it is not to be the police, judge and jury or to decide on the law of the land.</p>
<p>Their role is certainly not to usurp the expressed will of the people as reflected in Parliament.</p>
<p>The media should never lose sight of one fact – they are not elected.</p>
<p>They are self-appointed and accountable only to their proprietors in overseas boardrooms.</p>
<p>TVNZ are accountable only to themselves. Their organisation is a giant personal cash cow.</p>
<p>Instead of defending democracy in this country, the media are actually creating a threat to it by failing to give you ALL the facts and BOTH sides of the story.</p>
<p>The New Zealand First side of the story has yet to be told.</p>
<p>We have made some mistakes – trivial human mistakes that can be rectified.</p>
<p>We are confident about this.</p>
<p>Find one party that hasn’t.</p>
<p>Our mistakes happened after a change of three key office holders and in one case a serious communications gap.</p>
<p>Fair minded New Zealanders know that I have never enriched myself on any battle fought on their behalf.</p>
<p>In these battles we are fighting the same faces with whom over two decades we have had so many battles.</p>
<p>I have spent my whole political life to preserve New Zealand for New Zealanders.</p>
<p>This is an attempt to undo the people’s will, to bring down a government then govern alone. My enemies and an elite media have surely proven that.</p>
<p>My record over many years speaks for itself. I have made more sacrifices than most.</p>
<p>We want above everything else to be judged by decent New Zealanders who understand justice and the essence of democracy, not bias, prejudice and pre-judgement before any of the facts are even known.</p>
<p>We want you to decide our fate – not some media baron in a foreign boardroom.</p>
<p>And we will accept your decision – confident it will be fair.</p>
<p>ENDS  </p>
