<p>Labour Candidate for Wellington Central<br>Media Release</p>
<p>12 September 2008</p>
<p>An election about vision, leadership and trust</p>
<p>The 2008 general election will be fought over who has the vision and leadership to take New Zealand into the future, Grant Robertson the Labour Candidate for Wellington Central said today.</p>
<p>“On November 8th New Zealanders have a choice about the kind of society that they want to live in. The record of the Helen Clark led Labour Government is a fair, prosperous, inclusive and independent country. The alternative is a society where the divide between rich and poor grows, and where exclusion and intolerance can grow”, Grant said.</p>
<p>“Kiwis today have more security to make choices for their families as a result of the investments Labour has made over the last nine years. Working For Families, Kiwisaver, 20 hours free early childhood education, interest free student loans, increases to the minimum wage and four weeks annual leave among other policies are making a real difference to people’s lives” Grant said.</p>
<p>“National is on the record as opposing all of these policies. The truth is these advances are only safe with a Labour led government.”</p>
<p>“In the future Labour will continue to invest in the people who will drive our economy through investing in education, skills and innovation. We will continue to invest in health, education, housing and other key elements of a fair society. We are also focused on protecting and enhancing our environment for future generations” Grant said.</p>
<p>“Wellington has done well with a Labour-led government. We have invested in public transport, and supported the public services and creative industries that are the life-blood of the city. I am committed to continuing to stand up for Wellington if I am elected as MP. ”</p>
<p>“I am campaigning on the positive differences that Labour has made to people lives, here in Wellington and right around New Zealand. We live in a great city and a great country and the choice the country makes on the 8th of November will decide if we build on the gains of the last nine years.” Grant said</p>
