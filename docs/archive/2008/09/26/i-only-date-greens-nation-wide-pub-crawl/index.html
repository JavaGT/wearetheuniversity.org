<p>YOUNG GREEN SPOKESPERSON<br>MEDIA RELEASE 26 September</p>
<p>&#39;I only date Greens&#39; message for nation-wide pub crawl</p>
<p>Young Green Party candidates leading a pub crawl in Auckland, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin tonight will carry a key message where it matters - on beer-coasters.</p>
<p>“Young people in particular are a crucial constituency for us and we’re busy talking to young people and students on campuses, city streets and today on a synchronised pub crawl about our policies and why they need to party vote Green no matter who forms the next Government” Young Green spokesperson and Ohariu candidate Gareth Hughes says.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t see the National and Labour parties out campaigning like this. When Greens are campaigning we are out having fun” says Mr Hughes.</p>
<p>&quot;We don&#39;t have to pretend &#39;we&#39;re down&#39; with young people like the other parties because we have young people standing for us - not just old men reminiscing about the wharfie strike or the queen&#39;s coronation visit. We know we have the best and most relevant policies for young people, because we helped write them” says Mr Hughes</p>
<p>“The issues this election are crucial for students and young workers. Whether or not we actually lower student fees, and introduce a Universal Student Allowance, and raise the minimum wage depends on the Green Party” says Te Atatu candidate Xavier Goldie.</p>
<p>“Tonights not about drinking but it’s about going out to where the people are and having a political chat and also a bit of a laugh with the beer coasters and stickers we are handing out” says Mr Goldie.</p>

<p>“When young people look to Labour and National for the change this country really needs, we find them to come up very short. The most important message to get out is that under MMP there is more than one way to change the Government, and for young people the best way to vote is to Party Vote Green” says 18-year old Pakuranga candidate Zachary Dorner.</p>
<p>“The youth vote will have a huge bearing on the next Government, but with just under half of all young voters yet to enrol, we will definitely have enrolment forms &#39;on tap&#39;.” says Mr Dorner.</p>
