<p><strong>CAMPAIGN TRAIL AHEAD</strong></p>
<p>The 48th Parliament adjourned at 12.00pm today. It has been a momentous week, starting with the debate on the Privileges Committee report, some major Treaty settlements, including the Central North Island Forests and the Waikato River settlements, and valedictories from 13 MPs – mostly from Labour. I guess they see the writing on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>Positive way forward</strong><br>So it is now six weeks solid campaigning through to 8 November. National will have a positive campaign. We will be setting out our plan to take New Zealand forward into the next decade. There are some pretty big challenges, dealing with the economic crisis in the short term, lifting productivity, boosting growth, improving educational and health standards, and making our community safer. These are the issues we want New Zealanders to focus on when they cast their vote.</p>
<p>Over the last few months, National has been announcing a whole range of policy; on law and order, on health, on educational standards, on infrastructure – especially transport and energy, on immigration.</p>
<p>This week we announced our policy on Research Science and Technology. The full policy is available on National’s website, http://<a href="http://www.national.org.nz/">www.national.org.nz</a>. Spending research dollars wisely is the key. That is why we are refocussing the expenditure, so that it will have greatest impact.</p>
<p><strong>Going for growth</strong><br>Over the next few weeks, National will roll out its integrated growth plan; reducing tax, building infrastructure, enhancing innovation, reducing bureaucracy and building skills.</p>
<p>This country needs a boost if it is to keep its people. That is what National is committed to achieving.</p>
<p><strong>PARLIAMENT TAKES AN UNPRECEDENTED STEP –</strong><br><strong>RT HON WINSTON PETERS CENSURED</strong></p>
<p>On Tuesday this week the Parliament debated the Privileges Committee report. Every speaker (except Mr Peters) said the Committee’s procedures had been fair and reasonable. Virtually all the small parties supported the outcome.</p>
<p>Only Labour and New Zealand First had a different view, and even Labour admitted that the majority view had merit. I was a member of the Privileges Committee throughout the evidence and deliberations. A copy of the speech I gave in the House during Tuesday&#39;s debate will be available on my website, <a href="http://www.waynemapp.co.nz/">www.waynemapp.co.nz</a>.</p>
