<p>A DIVISIVE TRIBUNAL</p>
<p>The introduction of a parallel system of justice is a recurring topic of<br>concern in the UK, as debates continue between those in favour and those<br>adamantly against the introduction of Islam&#39;s Sharia law into the British<br>legal system. It has recently been revealed, however, that to a small<br>extent this already exists, in the form of the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal<br>(MAT): a tribunal that allows Muslims to have their disputes heard in a<br>setting which takes into consideration both British and Sharia law.</p>
<p>The MAT was set up in 2007 under the provisions of the Arbitration Act<br>1996, which allows the Tribunal to mediate and arbitrate on issues brought<br>before it by those seeking resolution under Islamic law. By working within<br>the framework of British law, any decisions made by the Tribunal can later<br>be enforced by the ordinary courts. As explained by MAT itself, the<br>Tribunal will, &#39;for the first time, offer the Muslim community a real and<br>true opportunity to settle disputes in accordance with Islamic Sacred Law<br>with the knowledge that the outcome as determined by MAT will be binding<br>and enforceable.&#39;</p>

<p>MAT deals mostly with disputes within the range of family, commercial and<br>inheritance law, and disputes between mosques: it does not have<br>jurisdiction to try criminal matters, although it will mediate on criminal<br>cases that fall within these other areas -- such as domestic violence. This<br>in particular has raised serious concerns in Britain as there are fears<br>that Islamic law treats women differently to men.</p>
<p>The Tribunal raises a number of important and difficult questions. Unlike<br>British law which sets up basic parameters, Sharia law is a personal law,<br>covering all the mundane, day-to-day aspects of a Muslim&#39;s life. Further,<br>it has different concepts of justice, unequal views of men and women, and<br>demands harsh punishment of anyone who wishes to be removed from its<br>authority. Moreover, one issue of particular difficulty is the Rule of Law,<br>which is undermined by a parallel system of justice. The Rule of Law states<br>that all people are equal under the law, and that the same law should apply<br>to all -- a concept that underpins the function of democracy. The parallel<br>legal system that the MAT effectively establishes not only divides a<br>society, but creates much confusion for the process of justice.</p>

<p>&#39;THE PLAINEST PART OF IT&#39;</p>
<p>Next time you have a headache it might be worth taking a trip to the art<br>gallery. You have heard of art for art&#39;s sake, well how about art for<br>ache&#39;s sake. Research has emerged from the University of Bari in Italy<br>showing a connection between pain relief and beautiful art. The study by Dr<br>Marina de Tommaso looked at the link between people&#39;s responses to pain and<br>their contemplation of art. When people were looking at art they found<br>beautiful, they experienced substantially less pain than when the same<br>painful stimuli was given to them while looking at art they found ugly. The<br>research demonstrates a clear connection between aesthetic beauty and pain<br>relief, reminding us that the human being is complex and interconnected,<br>that there is mystery to the way we work and that beauty has an intrinsic<br>place in human existence.</p>
<p>This research builds on what has been known for a long time. Diversional<br>therapy is a field that is dedicated solely to the notion that distracting<br>a person&#39;s attention away from their pain or anxieties makes life more<br>pleasant. However this study goes further by showing that beauty is not<br>merely a distraction, rather it changes the level of pain a person actually<br>experiences. This has implications for the way patients suffering pain are<br>treated. Whilst medication can be useful in treating pain, it may also be<br>helpful for aesthetics and beauty to be incorporated into the way that<br>hospitals are built and patients are treated. It also has more general<br>implications for the way life is understood, beckoning us towards an<br>understanding of health as intrinsically connected to what is often termed<br>our &#39;quality of life.&#39; It seems that health is about more than just<br>survival, it is shaped by the environments that a person is a part of and<br>the beauty that they do or do not see around them.</p>
<p>In the world of medicine, where science struggles to find ways to preserve<br>human life and minimise discomfort, there is a tendency to reduce human<br>life to its mechanisms -- a beating heart, a well -- working joint or<br>muscle. The link between aesthetics and pain reminds us that people cannot<br>be reduced to a collection of functions, or lifted from the environments in<br>which they live. As G. K. Chesterton once wrote &#39;The mystery of life is the<br>plainest part of it.&#39;</p>
<p>PAY YOUR OWN PARENTAL LEAVE?</p>
<p>The dilemma of balancing work and family life has taken centre stage<br>recently, with the topic of paid parental leave often at the forefront of<br>the debate. Into this context, the Centre for Independent Studies in<br>Australia has offered a policy paper proposing alternatives to state or<br>employer funded schemes. The paper suggests that self-funded parental<br>leave, provided through workers&#39; savings, or a state-organised loan scheme,<br>is a fairer and better way for parents to take time off work to be at home<br>with their children.</p>
<p>The proposal involves the retention of the current short-term scheme in<br>Australia, which provides for fourteen weeks&#39; state funded parental leave,<br>but proposes an additional provision for personal savings and loans that<br>would enable parents to stay at home with their children for extended<br>periods. The savings scheme they propose would be flexible, allowing<br>families to draw down savings for home deposits or retirement, as well as<br>maternity or paternity leave. It would also be supported by tax breaks. A<br>loan system is the second option put forward, whereby income-contingent<br>loans would be granted to families able to show they could pay them back.</p>
<p>The scheme is attractive due to the balance it strikes between public and<br>private interests. Another substantial benefit is its encouragement of<br>personal responsibility. It realises both the public and private interests<br>vested in encouraging parents to be at home with their children in the<br>early critical stages of development. However, despite the attractions of<br>such a scheme, with New Zealand wages relatively low and fairly high tax<br>rates, many families here would struggle to opt into it.</p>

<p>SCHOOLS PLUS</p>
<p>The Government has announced an initial investment of $39.4 million over<br>the next four years to further develop and implement the Schools Plus<br>programme. The Schools Plus proposal aims to introduce a system of<br>appropriate after-school training, career education and youth<br>apprenticeship schemes, so that by 2014 all young people up until the age<br>of eighteen will be in some form of education or training. The system is<br>intended to help address the current problem of low educational achievement<br>and low levels of literacy and numeracy from young school leavers and has<br>several valuable aspects. However, the compulsory nature of the proposal is<br>a drawback, as it restricts schools from having the flexibility or freedom<br>to develop individual plans to meet the needs of students who may not be<br>suited to remaining in education for so long.</p>

<p>HAVE YOUR SAY ON FATHERING</p>
<p>The Families Commission is currently undertaking research into a range of<br>family issues including how best they can assist men to be better fathers.<br>To this end they have set up a website that operates as an &#39;online panel&#39;<br>to find out what the public think. At the moment men are under-represented<br>on this site and as a result the Families Commission is looking for more<br>men to come forward and provide their feedback on fathering. This is a<br>great opportunity to have your say in a forum which could be influential in<br>forming responses to a variety of family issues.</p>
