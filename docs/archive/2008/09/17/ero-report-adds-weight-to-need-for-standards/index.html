<p>ERO report adds weight to need for National Standards</p>
<p>New research that shows nearly half of schools studied by the Education Review Office this year were not adequately monitoring or evaluating their initiatives for helping low performing students reinforces the need for National&#39;s policy to address literacy and numeracy, says Nationals Education spokeswoman, Anne Tolley.</p>
<p>Nearly 50% of the 125 primary and 30 secondary schools needed to improve the way they identified pupils who were at risk of not achieving in literacy and numeracy.</p>
<p>&quot;Our policy, National Standards, was developed specifically to address this problem.</p>
<p>&quot;And make no mistake - the problem is huge. Nearly 20% of students currently leave school unable to read, write, or do maths anywhere near their chronological age.</p>
<p>&quot;The report says there is a need for &#39;a strong focus on good quality, evidence-based teaching for all pupils&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;National Standards will see all children assessed from the time they enter school, and assisted to reach a national standard.</p>
<p>&quot;This report reinforces the need to ensure better monitoring, reviewing, and reporting on progress.</p>
<p>&quot;It is unacceptable that the ERO report found nearly half of schools were not doing this. With National Standards that will not be an option.</p>
<p>&quot;It is imperative for the future of our children that we put in place co-ordinated systems, encourage good professional development, and ensure parents take an active role in their children&#39;s achievement.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has presided over a nine-year failure to address an unacceptable literacy and numeracy problem.</p>
<p>&quot;National, by implementing National Standards, recognises that this can no longer be tolerated.&quot;</p>
