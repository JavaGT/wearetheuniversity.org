<p>Photographic historian to give first memorial lecture</p>
<p>An esteemed Australian photographic historian, curator and writer will give the inaugural Peter Turner Memorial Lecture next month.</p>
<p>Wellington-born Helen Ennis (left) will give the 9 October lecture on The Importance of Photography. Her starting point will be some of the published works of photography-enthusiast Peter Turner, for whom the lecture is named.</p>
<p>The annual lecture has been established in the memory of the late author, editor, curator and former teacher at the Wellington School of Design, who died in 2005.</p>
<p>Ms Ennis is a senior lecturer in art theory at the School of Art, Australian National University, Canberra. She says Mr Turner was always engaged with photography. &quot;He was an enthusiast, and mad about photography,” Ms Ennis says. “He was very determined to consider photography in a professional way but reach a broad audience.”</p>
<p>She says when she first started thinking about her lecture; she did not have to go far for inspiration. “I had three of Turner’s books on my own shelves, without even going to the library. He was a very important writer on photography of the 20th century.”</p>
<p>The lecture, at which 50 photographs will be shown, will also cover some of Ms Ennis’ thoughts on photography, including the potential for photographs to tell a story, and to be considered as more than just a two-dimensional object.</p>
<p>“It’s not just about a photo, a 2-D flat object, but about the size of the picture, the condition of it, whether is has writing on it, or has been filed in an album,” she says.</p>

<p>“My whole career has been based on the fact photography, more than anything else, is based in our own lives. I will be elaborating on that and trying to extend the way we might talk about and write about photos.”</p>
<p>Helen Ennis will present The Importance of Photography on 9 October at 6pm in the University’s Wellington campus Museum Building Tokomaru theatrette. All are welcome but please indicate attendance by emailing <a href="mailto:s.richards@massey.ac.nz">s.richards@massey.ac.nz</a> with &quot;Helen Ennis&quot; in the subject line.</p>
