<p>Press Release</p>
<p>Friday 19 September 2008</p>
<p>The Peoples Procession is coming to Hauraki-Waikato</p>
<p>“The Maori Party is pleased to endorse the petition to remove GST from the price of food and to cheer RAM on tomorrow as they launch the People&#39;s Procession to take their message to Parliament” stated Angeline Greensill, the Maori Party candidate for Hauraki-Waikato.</p>
<p>“The petition to remove GST-off-food is a powerful indictment on our present Government in that thousands of people have to march to have their voices heard” said Mrs Greensill.</p>
<p>&quot;The Maori Party has consistently advocated the need to drop GST off food in the context of strategies to address the social and income inequalities which are damaging our children&quot; said Mrs Greensill.</p>
<p>&quot;It was disappointing that when we raised the &#39;GST off&#39; message earlier in the year, both National and Labour ruled it out with the excuse that it may be too ‘complex’ or ‘difficult to implement’”.</p>
<p>&quot;So we were pleased to support the Residents Action Movement (RAM), who have the same policy desire as we do - in being committed to feeding families&quot; said Mrs Greensill. &quot;We encourage other groups to support the Peoples Procession”.</p>
<p>Mrs Greensill continued “Food riots are occurring throughout the world, so it is important that we remain committed to this peaceful, positive social action. The Maori Party has an active policy of Whanau Ora, which supports Healthy Families.”</p>
<p>“I would encourage social service groups, churches, marae, educational institutes and unions throughout Hauraki-Waikato to support the Peoples Procession and to add their weight behind this essential people’s movement”.</p>
