<p><strong>Wednesday, 10 September 2008, 3:49 pm</strong><br><strong>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party">New Zealand National Party</a></strong></p>
<p>Tony Ryall MP<br>National Party Health Spokesman</p>
<p>10 September 2008</p>
<p>Ryall not distracted by draft health policy release</p>
<p>National Party Health spokesman Tony Ryall is welcoming the opportunity to talk about healthcare in New Zealand, as presented by Labour and its stage-managed drip-feed of draft National Party policies.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has been quietly adopting proposals from National&#39;s Health Discussion Document all year, and I fully expect they&#39;ll be pinching more from us before election day.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ryall says the draft health policy released by Labour today is a draft, and the policy has been developing and evolving over a long period of time.</p>
<p>&quot;We will stick to our timeline. I&#39;m delighted that Labour is talking about health policy, and I&#39;m delighted the policy they want to talk about is ours. It&#39;s a shame David Cunliffe doesn&#39;t spend any time on developing policy of his own, and then we can have a real debate&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ryall says National will be releasing its final healthcare policies on its own terms, and there are likely to be changes to the draft documents released today. There are a number of policy initiatives not covered by these papers.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who&#39;s followed the development of our health policies will know how much work has gone into them. We have produced a comprehensive discussion document, received hundreds of submissions, and I&#39;ve been speaking extensively about the direction of healthcare under National.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Ryall notes that since the beginning of the year the Health Minister has moved to adopt at least nine National proposals, including:</p>
<p>* Proposals for integrated health centres.<br>* More frontline involvement in the running of our hospitals.<br>* A pledge to reprioritise the army of bureaucrats.<br>* Voluntary bonding through student loans write-offs.<br>* Better co-operation between district health boards.<br>* Clinical networks to improve services particularly in provincial areas. * Greater use of the independent sector.<br>* Spot audits and public disclosure of audit reports on rest homes.</p>
<p>&quot;And just today, the Health Minister quietly adopted National&#39;s proposal for the reinstatement of enrolled nurses.&quot;</p>
