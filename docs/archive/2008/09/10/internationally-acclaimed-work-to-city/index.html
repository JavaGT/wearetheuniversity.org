<p>Visiting artist brings internationally acclaimed work to city</p>
<p>Visiting artist Daniel Belton’s work has won over festivals in Europe and looks set to do the same in Palmerston North during the coming months.</p>
<p>The Dunedin-based dancer, choreographer and filmmaker has taken up a residency in the School of English and Media Studies until the end of October.</p>
<p>Mr Belton is a graduate from The New Zealand School of Dance. He has performed with many New Zealand and overseas companies. His dance films have been shown at more than 70 major international festivals.</p>
<p>His work After Durer recently won the prize for most innovative work at the Festival Internazionale di Videodanza in Naples, Italy, while a more recent work, Matchbox, has been accepted by a number of other festivals.</p>
<p>He says finishing the editing of Matchbox is a priority while at the Palmerston North campus.</p>
<p>“But I’m also doing some research, using the fantastic library here, on a new piece about the archetypal clown and storyboarding another short film about a robot toy.”</p>
<p>Mr Belton says the artist in residence post gives him both the time and money to work intensely on new projects.</p>
<p>“It’s also good to have other creative writers around the school to work through ideas with,” he says. “Having the opportunity to contribute to the drama papers run by Dr Angie Farrow is also very rewarding.”</p>
<p>A screening of his recent work will be held at the Palmerston North City Library on Wednesday, September 24. His work is also being screened at the Film Archive in Wellington throughout September.</p>
<p>Mr Belton will be involved in the Festival of New Arts, which begins in early October and features drama, music, poetry and visual art at venues throughout Palmerston North.</p>
