<p>10 September 2008<br>Listen to tourism lobby, not just Fonterra, Mr Mallard</p>
<p>Greens Co-Leader Russel Norman is urging Environment Minister Trevor Mallard to take as much notice of tourism industry lobbying as he has of lobbying by polluters in recent months.</p>
<p>The Tourism Industry Association has issued a Tourism Industry Election Manifesto today which lists &quot;Improving New Zealand&#39;s Environmental Performance&quot; as one of six government priorities. It says the tourism industry &quot;cannot deliver on New Zealand&#39;s 100% Pure brand promise on its own&quot;.</p>
<p>Says Dr Norman, &quot;This comes at the same time as some of our farming and regional media are condemning the Government&#39;s freshwater policies. Compared to city media, these newspapers and radio stations are closest to increasingly-polluted waterways, one of New Zealand&#39;s biggest environmental concerns of the moment.</p>
<p>&quot;The Rural News website in a September 2 article says Mr Mallard&#39;s &#39;recently outlined [Proposed] National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management demonstrates an abject failure in leadership&#39; and is a &#39;spineless consultation document&#39; and an August 29 article on the same website says New Zealand dirty dairying is now &#39;gaining international notoriety&#39; with coverage in both the United States and Britain.&quot;</p>
<p>Also on September 2, a business story in the Waikato Times headed &quot;Action urged on &#39;dirty dairying&#39;&quot; describes how former Fonterra Shareholders&#39; Council member and multimillionaire Allan Crafar has been prosecuted four times for dirty dairying in the Waikato and is due to appear in court for two other alleged offences.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr Mallard is fiddling while our waterways burn with pollution,&quot; Dr Norman says. &quot;As the 82,000 circulation Rural News said on August 5, the Minister&#39;s new freshwater policies were &#39;toothless&#39; and he was &#39;ducking for cover&#39; after a &#39;powerful consortium of agriculture interests&#39; lobbied him.</p>
<p>&quot;Luckily the Government&#39;s Proposed National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management released in July is still open for change and the Minister could decide to keep Labour&#39;s promise to make all water bodies safe for swimming within a generation.</p>
<p>&quot;He could add specific dates and defined water quality standards to the document so all regional councils have a clear mandate to clamp down hard against effluent pollution. Not all councils are doing so now. But will he listen to those with &#39;100% Pure&#39; branding interests, or only to Fonterra?&quot;</p>
<p>Note: Dr Norman is speaking on this issue in General Debate later this afternoon.</p>
